And he made the biggest fucking deal out of it. He made a video, started selling it. This is sort of the beginning of his documentary empire, started getting a lot of attention for it, because it was this mysterious place where powerful people go, and Alex Jones, he sells himself as the only person who's been able to break in. right. And the hallmark of it, the big coup de gras, is he got footage of the cremation of care ceremony, which is the most famous part of the video. It's the part that everyone who's seen it, it's the part they remember because the rest of it's fucking bullshit. It's a video of a giant stone owl, where they burn a figure in effigy.

No. Section Eight article 18 was too fine a screen for me and my attempts to get a job as a waiter or a valet in one of the camps failed. In the end, I entered by stealth. Some observers of the grove have warned that security was too good. They'd sniff me out immediately. I might last three hours before they put me in Santa Rosa jail for trespassing. Lowell Bergman, a producer with 60 Minutes who used to hunt rabbits in the nearby hills, remembered a fire road leading into a site near the Guerneville waste treatment plant, but said they'd spot me sneaking in. Others mentioned barbed wire and electronic monitoring devices and places where the grove abuts Mount Rio, and helicopters patrolling the ridge roads that traverse the 1000 foot hills and formed the groves perimeter.\""
