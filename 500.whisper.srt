I have great respect for Knowledgefight

I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,960
Saying we are the bad guys

Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,800
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,000
I love your room

Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan

28
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,920
I'm Jordan

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,880
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

31
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,360
Oh indeed we are Dan

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,800
Jordan

33
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,440
Dan!

34
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,120
Jordan!

35
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,880
Quick question for you

36
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,360
What's up?

37
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,240
What's your bright spot today?

38
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,040
My bright spot today, Jordan, is something, it actually happened a little bit back

39
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,640
but it's something I've been reflecting on and it's appropriate for the 500th episode

40
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,320
that we're doing here

41
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,960
Oh, nice way to smooth in that little 500 reference

42
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,080
Yeah, for sure, I'm very, you know, so it's all about smoothness

43
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,280
I like it, I like it

44
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:38,640
Um, so I recently was asked or invited by listener Sarah Beth to give a little bit of a Q&A session

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,440
discussion with a college course that she presides over

46
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:51,800
and it was just such a rewarding, interesting experience to be, you know, asked to talk to these college students

47
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,560
about, you know, issues like researching topics

48
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,000
and it was, it was amazing

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,560
and I can't thank Sarah Beth enough for inviting me and these kids were great

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,040
Although scary, I'm scared

51
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,760
Sure, sure

52
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,800
I'm scared of college kids

53
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,640
Sure, naturally

54
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,240
For one, because they look so young and they are adults, technically

55
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,480
Yeah

56
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,560
That scares the shit out of me

57
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,200
Yeah, that is a problem

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,080
And then also, like, I remember back when I was in college, I would just be disapproving by nature

59
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,480
sort of like the default look on your face is

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,200
Sure, sure, sure, sure

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,280
Yeah, you're in class

62
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,880
Yeah, yeah

63
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,080
You know, I'm used to being a stand-up and I want to elicit a response

64
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,600
Sure, sure

65
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,840
A positive response from the

66
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,520
And so it's always tough to imagine, like, just even myself back in college

68
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,040
Oh, yeah

69
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,040
Like, to try and look at my face

70
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,240
Trying to convey a message

71
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,320
You know, we've had plenty of friends who've gone back and forth from doing stand-up and teaching

72
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,400
You know, like they were teachers while they were stand-ups

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,480
and it never occurred to me that you would have to stand up in front of all the same types of people

74
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,240
but they don't make a response at all

75
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,720
Yeah, it's

76
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,320
That's infuriating

77
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,280
It's terrifying because they're a crowd, but they're not a crowd

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,240
Yeah, they're not a crowd

79
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,640
Yeah

80
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,960
I can't do crowd work

81
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,760
I'm not going to do a little five minutes up top every time

82
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,040
No, that's not going to work

83
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,160
Yeah, so thank you so much to Sarah Beth and those students

84
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
It was just a great experience

85
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,680
That's really cool

86
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,080
First time

87
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,720
I get to call myself a guest lecturer now

88
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,400
I think

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,320
I believe you do

90
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,080
I can put that in my title

91
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,800
I believe you do, that's in there

92
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Yeah, so how about you?

93
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, my bright spot, Dan, normally would be that Assassin's Creed Valhalla is coming out

94
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Sure, but not yet

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,480
Not yet, it's not here

96
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,960
Although we set a bad precedent with me being able to do a preemptive one with Pikmin

97
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,240
That's true, that's true

98
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,840
But I won't be choosing that because, Dan, my audiobook is finished and it is up on the website

99
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,840
for everybody to download at their leisure

100
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,600
Congratulations

101
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,680
Yeah, it was cool, it was really fun to do

102
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,440
Thank you very much for helping me produce it

103
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
Sure, made a tiny cameo

104
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,320
Yeah, absolutely

105
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,040
Yeah, if you read it, there are some easter eggs and some weird things that are there on purpose

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,600
I promise you to confuse you and kind of disorient things for a little bit

107
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,200
Awesome

108
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,760
Yeah, yeah

109
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,960
And people can find that at thequietpartloud.com

110
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,640
Indeed, yep, that's where they can find it

111
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,120
I'm very proud of you, I'm excited that it's out and people can enjoy the fruits of your labor

112
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,600
by which I mean screaming in my apartment

113
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,360
If you want to go straight from listening to four hours of us talk

114
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,640
and then instead get rid of the best part of this podcast, I think it's a great idea to listen to my audiobook

115
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,120
Get rid of me and replace it with you doing voices

116
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,400
More me, yeah

117
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,280
Very exciting

118
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,320
Yeah, it's not great

119
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,800
Um, that's great, despite what you say

120
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's awesome, I'm very happy about it

121
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,600
So, Jordan, today we got an interesting thing to do

122
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,600
We're going to be talking about a little bit of Election Time Infowars

123
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,840
Oh, yay, I've been hearing about things

124
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,480
But things might be a little bit different than what people could have expected

125
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,360
Last week, Jordan, we talked about how it would be too difficult to do an episode about the election

126
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,880
to be released on that Wednesday

127
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,880
And that remained true when it came time to record Friday's episode

128
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,480
At that point, there was just too much uncertainty

129
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,720
It felt very difficult to discuss the whole thing without having any feelings of closure about the election itself

130
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,880
Now, as it stands on Sunday, as we record Monday's show, there's a bit more of a sense of finality

131
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:20,360
All the networks have called the race for Biden, and it looks like the basis for any kind of legal challenge Trump's campaign could make

132
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,480
It'll be weak, and it'll probably go nowhere

133
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:30,520
Everybody celebrating the Biden win owes a huge raise of the glass to the on-the-ground organizers and voter registration activists

134
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,480
in those battleground states that could easily have gone the other way

135
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,240
Oh, easily

136
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:41,760
It's still mind-blowing that it was anywhere near that close, but right now our country probably owes a deep debt of gratitude to a ton of people

137
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,920
whose names you'll likely never know

138
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,800
So, now, there's a bit more of a sense of what's going on

139
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,200
I feel like I'm standing on more solid ground, so it's time to get to Alex's election coverage

140
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Let's see what happened

141
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,920
Or maybe not

142
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,040
As I reflected over the weekend, I had a bit of...

143
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,480
I do like that twist

144
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,120
That was a very good... I was like, yeah, that was the time when you're like, or maybe not, fuck you, Dan

145
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,320
I had a bit of a realization, Jordan

146
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,800
A large part of the motivation for me doing this podcast was my revulsion at seeing Alex and his crew laughing

147
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,880
at the diverse crowds of Hillary supporters crying on election night 2016

148
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,160
mocking what was, for many of them, a very real and justified existential fear

149
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,640
So now, the tables are turned a little bit, and we have an opportunity to laugh at his behavior on election night when things didn't go his way

150
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,400
Do we mock his tears, comfortable in the knowledge that they're probably fake?

151
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,480
And even if they are real, the things he's afraid of aren't real?

152
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,880
Is it just as bad for me to do a show where I relish in his election night lows?

153
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,360
Obviously, the answer to that is no, it wouldn't be just as bad for me to do that

154
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,880
Oh, of course not

155
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,160
It would be totally cool, and maybe fun

156
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,120
It'd be fine, it'd be great, I'd love it

157
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,640
But also, I'm not going to do that, but for slightly different reasons

158
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,120
What Alex Jones did on election night literally doesn't matter

159
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,160
We can mock his freaking out and yelling the same bullshit he yells every day

160
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,720
We can discuss his very dubious claim that he decided not to go on Rogan's livestream of his own accord

161
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,040
We can talk about his obvious intentions to incite violence, but here's the thing

162
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:18,120
The most disrespectful thing I think you can do in terms of Alex's election night coverage

163
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,320
is to treat it how it deserves to be treated, and that's to say, who gives a shit?

164
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,120
You asshole

165
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,160
Eh, get the fuck out of here

166
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,880
The lashing out, the tears, the yelling about demons, it's all meaningless

167
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,560
Some pills might have gotten sold, but if I'm going for schadenfreude, I'm not going halfway

168
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,280
And saying, we'll talk about your election coverage sometime, but it's totally not important now

169
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,720
That's way harsher than playing clips of Alex yelling nonsense and then saying, haha, your guy lost

170
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,560
Yeah, that's true

171
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,480
So we're going to talk about the election coverage another time

172
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,000
Maybe a year from now, who knows, I don't know

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But it's not out of respect for Alex and his crew in this difficult time, but out of a deeper disrespect

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,680
I'd like it

175
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,120
So fuck all of you at Infowars

176
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,680
Yeah, this is a straight up needful things twist that you have right here

177
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,160
The reality is that Alex is now entering uncharted territory

178
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,480
His audience has been led to believe that any non-Trump win would be the result of large-scale election fraud

179
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,600
thereby making any Biden presidency illegitimate

180
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,560
Further, he's extensively characterized his opponents, from high-level politicians to street-level activists

181
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,720
as pedophiles and vampires in the employ of the literal Christian devil

182
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:33,160
Over and over again, he said that Trump getting elected was the equivalent of the biblical story of God giving a reprieve to Nineveh

183
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:38,520
In that story, Jonah is enlisted by God to warn the people of Nineveh to repent of their evil ways

184
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,400
But he decides to go somewhere else

185
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,920
He ends up getting swallowed by a whale and then realizes, I got a job to do

186
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,200
So he goes to Nineveh after he gets out of the whale

187
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,640
And then he convinces everyone there to repent

188
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,760
thereby saving the city from God's judgment and destruction

189
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,720
According to the way Alex characterizes Trump's role as being reminiscent of this story

190
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,440
combined with the people of the United States not deciding to repent by getting on board with Trump

191
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,680
this naturally leads to a different conclusion than Jonah's story

192
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,080
We're all gonna get eaten by a bigger whale

193
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,080
This is kind of more like Sodom and Gomorrah in the way that Alex is characterizing it

194
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,360
If you take Alex seriously, Alex has taught his audience that his enemies are literal demons

195
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,720
dead set on the killing of the entire planet to appease Lucifer and turn into robots or whatever

196
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,640
and that Trump was the US's only chance to repent and be saved

197
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,280
Now that that has been passed, it seems like it's time to become a full-on wrath of God doomsday preacher

198
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,200
That's one possible avenue Alex could be going down

199
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,840
I honestly have no idea what Alex's pivot will be

200
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,560
but I'm interested to see how much of the stuff he retains and how much he just pretends

201
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,040
I never said that shit

202
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,520
His audience is captured so he could just start walking another direction

203
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,800
and as long as he talks fast enough and jingles those keys around

204
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,200
he'll retain some percentage of the audience

205
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,360
Some new lieutenant colonel will tell Alex about some new piece of intel that'll make everything make sense

206
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,240
how there's still good guys fighting off the devil inside the government or something

207
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,600
We'll see what he ends up doing

208
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,840
but I've learned not just to assume that the boat is gonna sink

209
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,320
because it looks like, boy, that boat has gotta sink

210
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,360
Alex still has a few cards left to play

211
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,720
The boat should have enough holes in it and his box should have no air holes in it

212
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,600
and that should be enough to take him down, but it doesn't seem to be

213
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,720
For sure

214
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,360
So I'm going to leave desperate and intensely boring electoral Alex to his games

215
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,200
He can try to whip up excitement about his attempt at branding Trump's lame duck session as the 79 days of hell

216
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,040
but I don't think that's gonna catch on

217
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,960
and I wouldn't be surprised if Alex even loses interest in it before January comes around

218
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,520
Oh yeah

219
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,840
But where does that leave us?

220
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,000
What are we gonna cover here for today's episode?

221
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,520
Episode 500

222
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,320
Well, I've found that this show works best when I follow my heart and my instincts

223
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,720
and there's only one thing that I want to talk about today

224
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,200
and that's how Infowars has been reeling at the beginning of this 79 days of hell

225
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,560
We could talk about Alex going to Maricopa County on Thursday

226
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,640
and using an adult-sized bullhorn to yell about how they needed to stop counting ballots

227
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,320
but honestly that just seems like a waste of time

228
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,080
The race in Arizona has been called for Biden

229
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,200
and honestly that wasn't much more than a sad and entirely predictable publicity stunt on Alex's part

230
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,440
No, that would be a waste of time

231
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,080
What I want to discuss is something far more important

232
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,720
which is what happens to a propaganda outlet that's run by a tyrannical central authority

233
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,400
when their anointed God King is losing an election

234
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,120
and their tyrannical central authority runs off to Arizona to do a publicity stunt

235
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,560
How does the leaderless and almost certainly confused underling who works there

236
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
how do they keep the operation going?

237
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
How do they respond?

238
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,000
Wait, how long has he been gone?

239
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,560
Well, he's back now but in the period he left on Thursday after his show

240
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,920
and then I think he got back on like Saturday

241
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,880
Okay, so for two days he just wasn't there

242
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,960
He might have been back on Friday, I'm not entirely sure

243
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,640
We're going to be covering Thursday evening into Friday morning

244
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,240
and just sort of what goes on when the daddy's gone

245
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,960
Right, so we're going to watch a bunch of incompetent people scramble around

246
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,440
A little bit

247
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,280
and it's going to be fantastic

248
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,960
A little bit

249
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,400
We're also going to hear Alex's show on Thursday

250
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,080
A bit of that as well

251
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,560
I present to you, Jordan, episode 500

252
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,560
or why Infowars doesn't work without Alex

253
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,160
Okay

254
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,600
But before we get down to business on that

255
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,280
got to give a shout out to folks who have made these past 500 episodes possible

256
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,760
Oh, nicely done

257
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,800
So first, KevKev, please, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

258
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,880
I'm a policy wonk

259
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,400
Thank you very much, KevKev

260
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,640
Thank you, next, DJ Booth, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

261
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,720
I'm a policy wonk

262
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,760
Thanks, DJ Booth

263
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,000
Thank you so much, next, SickFucker, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

264
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,040
I'm a policy wonk

265
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,520
Thanks, SickFucker

266
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,760
Also, that's just all vowels taken out

267
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,180
I didn't know how else to… I couldn't just say so...

268
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,280
Anyway, Dr. Milton Wigglesworth, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

269
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,400
I'm a policy wonk

270
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,840
Thank you very much, Dr. Milton

271
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,200
Thank you, next Antifa Bogeyman, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

272
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
I'm a policy wonk

273
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,440
Ah, thank you very much, Antifa Bogeyman

274
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,240
Thank you, next, Amber A, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

275
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
I'm a policy wonk

276
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,080
Thanks, Amber

277
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,680
Thank you, next, Kristopher R, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

278
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,800
I'm a policy wonk

279
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,000
Thanks, Christopher

280
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,720
And then I'd like to give a shout-out to someone who donated on Elevated Level, we appreciate

281
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,880
that very much.

282
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,880
And this person has a bone to pick with someone named Peter from Denmark, one of our listeners,

283
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,240
who is the ordained ruler of the wonks in Denmark.

284
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,240
I did not know that.

285
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,040
There apparently is tension in Denmark, and there may actually be a bit of a feud.

286
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,840
Are you saying there's literally trouble in Denmark?

287
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,280
There may be trouble in Denmark.

288
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,920
All right, okay.

289
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,880
We have a contender for the title of blank of Denmark.

290
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
Okay.

291
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,520
So we have Peter from Denmark, who's now been the from Denmark.

292
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
He's the only from Denmark.

293
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,800
But now we have Dines M from Denmark.

294
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Thank you so much.

295
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
You are now a technocrat.

296
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
I'm a policy wonk.

297
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Crikey, mate.

298
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
That's fantastic.

299
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Have yourself a brew.

300
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
How's your 401k doing, bro?

301
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,560
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

302
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,060
Let's just get down to business.

303
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,120
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

304
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,060
Why are you pimps so good?

305
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,700
My neck is freakishly large.

306
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,360
I declare info war on you.

307
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Thank you so much, Dines.

308
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,720
Yes, thank you very much, Dines from Denmark.

309
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,800
I'm going to stay out of this conflict and see who comes out on top, and then say that

310
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,480
I was always on this side to pick it up.

311
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
What are you, Ireland?

312
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
Come on now.

313
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,080
Finally, a special wonk shout out I'd like to make is to Bex, who sent us a wonderful

314
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,840
care package a while back.

315
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,240
I thought that we'd done the whole technocrat shout out, but I believe we might have forgotten,

316
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
or maybe...

317
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
I'm not entirely sure what happened.

318
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,600
I believe we've already done it in the past.

319
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Maybe.

320
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,640
There are a handful of us, if we did mess up or miss it, so I want to attempt to right

321
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,240
this wrong by declaring that Bex, you're not a technocrat.

322
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,640
No, no, no, no.

323
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,720
You're a raptor princess, and in honor of that, I've made a special drop.

324
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,480
There was a request that we use the old technocrat drop because it included the Daddy Shark clip,

325
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,440
but I decided that it would be better if I just made a new one, which also included the

326
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Daddy Shark one.

327
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,280
It's 45 seconds of just the Daddy Shark one on repeat, isn't it?

328
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
That'd be great.

329
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
That'd be great.

330
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
So thank you so much, Bex.

331
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,680
Also, thank you for...

332
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,560
We got a special episode 500 package that we're going to be opening on a bonus episode

333
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,000
that'll be out on Friday from Bex, and I don't know what's in it, but it looks cool.

334
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's very exciting.

335
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's very thoughtful and awesome.

336
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm very excited.

337
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yes.

338
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,520
We appreciate you very much, and my apologies that I'm absolutely terrible at social media

339
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
correspondences.

340
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,020
This one's going out to you, Bex.

341
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,020
Thank you so much.

342
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,120
You are now a raptor princess.

343
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
I'm a policy wonk.

344
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,500
You know, they got Baby Shark, deet deet deet deet deet deet, Hillary Clinton.

345
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,440
It's fun to laugh at Alex Jones.

346
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
It's fun.

347
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,120
No, my religion is facts.

348
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,340
Get that through your peep ring.

349
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,480
They got Mama Shark, beep beep, beep beep beep.

350
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm dead inside.

351
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,400
I have no guilt.

352
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,560
I'm a really good guy.

353
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,320
There's three ways to learn, or maybe four.

354
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,880
I am that Messiah.

355
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
What can I do?

356
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
Daddy Shark.

357
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
I hate myself.

358
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,880
And I feel like a complete failure.

359
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Thank you so much, Bex.

360
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,880
Thank you very much, Bex.

361
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
Oh.

362
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
That's a wonderful new drop.

363
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,960
It will never be played again.

364
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Never be played again.

365
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
One time only use.

366
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Absolutely.

367
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
All right.

368
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,200
So, Jordan, now let's jump into this episode.

369
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Let's do it.

370
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Because we are deep into this.

371
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
All right.

372
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
All right.

373
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,000
So, we're going to start here on November 5th.

374
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,520
We are past the election.

375
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Alex is reeling.

376
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,900
You know, the count is still going on, but all indications are that, you know, things

377
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,160
are not looking that great for Trump to win.

378
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,600
There's a number of paths, but they all involve winning Pennsylvania, and then some other

379
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,960
things also.

380
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:46,680
Hope is getting, you know, at that point, it's getting to the area where some conservatives

381
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,320
are talking rebrand.

382
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

383
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,200
Alex is a little bit like Wile E. Coyote in that Trump is the roadrunner who painted the

384
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,040
way forward on the wall, and Alex is the one who crashes headfirst into reality.

385
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Exactly.

386
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
He hits the barbed wire.

387
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

388
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Not good.

389
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,040
So, here's where he's at.

390
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,660
Now, let me give you the big announcement here.

391
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:15,220
If Joe Biden gets in, they're never getting rid of the lockdown.

392
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,360
Think about that.

393
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,020
It's a lot bigger than just kicking Trump out and flooding everything with fake ballots

394
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,820
using the lockdown as the cover for it.

395
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:28,400
They want to bankrupt us and then have us have an app to be able to leave our front

396
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,940
door and step one foot outside of our house.

397
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,400
That is the admitted globalist chai con plan.

398
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,260
So I guess that's now the angle is if Biden gets in, then the lockdown is never going

399
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,260
to end.

400
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,400
COVID's here forever or something.

401
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,600
I kind of think that one might even be hard for his followers to buy.

402
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Yeah.

403
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Really, you're going to say that Joe Biden is just going to say everyone stay inside.

404
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,300
Also, what do you want us to do now?

405
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,300
The election's over.

406
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,300
Yeah.

407
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,300
What are you trying to...

408
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,660
Also, furthermore, the lockdown already happened and nobody listened to it anyways.

409
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,820
What are we going to, what's Biden going to change about that?

410
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,800
He's going to have even less evil fucking DHS coming into people's homes.

411
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,140
He seems probably less willing to use a lot of the force that Trump has been.

412
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,980
I mean, except for against left-wing protesters.

413
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:22,100
Well, but look, man, there was an election and it was fraught with fraud.

414
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
There's a lot of it.

415
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,100
I remember that.

416
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,500
Well, maybe you didn't hear about this.

417
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Oh, okay.

418
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,580
And there's videos of what appear to be Chinese individuals in Michigan arriving with those

419
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:37,120
ballots at 4 a.m. illegally and going into the buildings with ballot boxes that then

420
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,740
were all for Biden.

421
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,100
The arrogance level is so atrocious.

422
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,780
I don't even know.

423
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:53,700
So, is he implying that China sent people from China to Michigan with marked ballots

424
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,820
for Biden?

425
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,660
These marked ballots ostensibly also coming from China.

426
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,900
Well, and the box itself is the only thing that you probably see in the videos.

427
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,580
It has to say ballots for Biden on the box.

428
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,580
Exactly, with the Chinese flag.

429
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,820
That's the only thing that makes sense.

430
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,860
There were a bunch of these videos that were going around.

431
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,940
There were drastic misrepresentations of things.

432
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,540
There was one that was a television crew that was unloading gear that people thought were

433
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,300
ballots going in.

434
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:28,020
Then there was a video that went around that was actually from years ago in Russia that

435
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,660
people were just saying was from one of these states.

436
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,900
Yeah, there's just a hundred of these things.

437
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,740
And Alex has really latched on to the idea that there was a suspicious, possibly Chinese

438
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,740
person.

439
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,180
Yeah, that's real.

440
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:49,980
That's just real sad on a conspiracy level of just like, man, they could have mailed

441
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,620
them to San Francisco and had a white person drive them there.

442
00:19:53,620 --> 00:20:00,580
Why would you fly directly from China to... What did they land on top of the ballot counting

443
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,540
building in a helicopter?

444
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,740
Look, there's a lot of problems with this from just sort of a real world perspective,

445
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,300
but you listen to it and you can kind of hear what his, like where he's coming from.

446
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,780
You can see why this is the story that he's telling.

447
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:22,100
So Alex is, I would say, pretty close to a line.

448
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:28,420
And that line is what I like to call the saying, hey, let's do some offensive violence line.

449
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,060
He's pretty close to that line.

450
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:37,460
They are involved in a revolution fully conquering the United States and killing our republic

451
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,780
and they're hammering the last nails into the damn coffin to bury us alive as slaves

452
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,380
of their system.

453
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,660
So I'm not a macho guy.

454
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,340
I don't say things just to say them, but I'll tell you this.

455
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,340
Yeah, you do.

456
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:58,900
I'm not going to launch any offensive violence at this point because I've not had time to

457
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,020
really think about the right course in history.

458
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,820
But I know this.

459
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,900
If we let them steal this election and we let them put a Chinese communist agent who's

460
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:14,340
fully compromised with all the proof in there to have control of the nuclear codes, all

461
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,100
of us are aiding and abetting the destruction of our country and the handover to the most

462
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,380
authoritarian nation the world's ever seen, communist China.

463
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:28,100
And I will not be an accomplice and I will not aid and abet this type of takeover.

464
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,900
So if I understand correctly what he's saying, first of all, I have to take issue with the

465
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,500
idea that he said, I haven't had time to think about.

466
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Yeah.

467
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,220
You've done nothing but talk about this.

468
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,820
I would suggest that you've been thinking about this almost nonstop for-

469
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,820
Since 1995.

470
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,820
Yeah.

471
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,820
You've been talking about it on air since-

472
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,740
That's pretty much the only thing you've been talking about.

473
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,900
I haven't given any thought to when you start being violent.

474
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,900
Wow.

475
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,900
Wow.

476
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,300
The course of history, blah, blah, blah.

477
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,300
Yeah.

478
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,300
What is the course of history?

479
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,940
Well, if you understand what he's saying, he's saying that Joe Biden is controlled by

480
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,940
China.

481
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,940
Yes.

482
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:08,580
So if we, by we, I mean, Alex and the Patriots, if we allow Joe Biden to take office with

483
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:14,220
the nuclear codes and what have you, you are complicit in aiding and abetting the Chinese

484
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,980
communist takeover.

485
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,180
So I mean, that would be the Joe Biden getting into office would be the condition then for

486
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,660
offensive violence, right?

487
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,660
Yeah.

488
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,660
That's the only thing that makes sense.

489
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,660
That's the only way we can understand the sentence.

490
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,660
Yeah.

491
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:33,700
Him saying all of this is simply, I am not counseling actual violence until they're swearing

492
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,940
him in, I guess.

493
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,700
But once they swear him in, well, yeah, we got to blow it up because they're the most

494
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,700
authoritarian.

495
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,540
Or if you could do something that you could conceivably argue is going to stop him from

496
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,540
being sworn in.

497
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,540
Sure.

498
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,540
Sure.

499
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
Sure.

500
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,080
Right on that line.

501
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,100
Put a limousine in front of the gates to the White House.

502
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,420
If he can't get in, buddy, guess what?

503
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,420
Yeah.

504
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,420
Never becomes president.

505
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,420
Alex is doing well.

506
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,420
Yeah.

507
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,420
Yeah.

508
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
I think so.

509
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,420
Yeah.

510
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,860
So Alex is just, it's bland.

511
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,420
I would describe this show as flat.

512
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,180
There's very little going on that even peaks my interest at all.

513
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,700
It's just the hits.

514
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,540
It's just kind of like him saying the same things and kind of hitting his bases.

515
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,540
Sure.

516
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,300
These are criminals that have brokered the shell out of America and they want to position

517
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:28,500
the global government and they want to atomize the family and domesticate us so we can never

518
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,820
rise again and never resist the nightmare future they've got for all of us.

519
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,140
The chains are going on right now.

520
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,460
You're being disenfranchised.

521
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,460
All of us are.

522
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:44,500
So we better work peacefully now so that war does not become inevitable.

523
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,700
But we are now entering this season of war.

524
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,020
Our country is at war for its very life.

525
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,140
You are under attack.

526
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,340
You are being conquered.

527
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,340
You are being taken over.

528
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:59,980
We are in the midst of a chai combat attempted takeover of the country and we're losing right

529
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,980
now.

530
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,580
I just can't feel anything here anymore.

531
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,580
Yeah.

532
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,700
Honestly personally, like I was thinking about it whenever we heard the first clip of him

533
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:16,460
talking and then I realized that right now the only thing I'm interested in really is,

534
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,660
is he going to take the plunge?

535
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,180
You know, what is he going to do?

536
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,180
What is he going to do?

537
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,180
Yeah.

538
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,220
He's going to take the leap or you're going to back off and if you back off, fuck you

539
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,220
forever.

540
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,060
And if you take the leap, all right, now let's see what's happening.

541
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,060
And also fuck you.

542
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,060
And also fuck you.

543
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,060
Or do you pivot?

544
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,300
Do you change your whole brand to God?

545
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,300
Sure.

546
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Like do you do that?

547
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,780
Do you become televangelist Alex or whatever?

548
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,940
That seems to be the way to make way better money than what he's doing.

549
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,740
And it seems like a place where he could play a lot more games about like state oppression.

550
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,740
Yeah.

551
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

552
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,220
Like he could get Infowars into an actual church, you know?

553
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

554
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:58,060
If he pivoted to becoming Scientology and then like just made it his entire life's mission

555
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:05,540
to be a nonprofit or for the government not to tax him, I can see that working.

556
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,420
Yeah, that might be the next best thing.

557
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

558
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,100
So I agree with you.

559
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,140
It's like, I'm not really interested in yelling about the Chinese.

560
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:23,740
I really, you know, maybe it's just a momentary thing, but I'm a little bit bored by the like

561
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,260
waffling around offensive violence.

562
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

563
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,860
It's just like, we know what you're doing.

564
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:36,420
It's not really, I'm not interested in his going to Phoenix to yell into a bullhorn that

565
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,420
much.

566
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,420
I'm not that interested in it.

567
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,420
I'm a little bit interested in it.

568
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,900
I think the bullhorn was too big for me to be that interested in it.

569
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,900
I agree.

570
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,900
I agree.

571
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,900
Yeah.

572
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:51,820
I think somebody might've told him that the tiny bullhorn was a source of humor.

573
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:58,860
I mean, you know, it's just a, yeah, the thing that is the most interesting is like, what

574
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,860
are you going to do?

575
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,860
Yeah.

576
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,140
You have a problem and I want to see how you fix it or at least I want to see how you deal

577
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,140
with it.

578
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,320
Cause I don't think you're going to fix it.

579
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,500
That's a probably a good note.

580
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Yeah.

581
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
Good correction.

582
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Yeah.

583
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:18,260
What we're seeing right now is what we see him do a lot at times when I think people

584
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,340
could probably predict that there's going to be a possibility for some violence.

585
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,940
I think any right thinking person, I'm not making any specific prediction or anything,

586
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:37,980
but I do think that as we get closer to the inauguration, we do see probably an increased

587
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,860
danger of some kind of right wing violence.

588
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,420
I don't know that it's going to happen and it very well may not, but I think the odds

589
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:53,220
of some kind of a thing happening maybe possible.

590
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,700
I think Alex recognizes that.

591
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,540
And so he goes out of his way to very consistently talk about how false flags are coming.

592
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,540
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

593
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,540
Well, I promise you this.

594
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:09,060
I'm not giving up ever because I know the more I bend over, the worst stuff gets, and

595
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,980
I will not sit here and be part of this.

596
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,460
Now, that doesn't mean they blow something up and say, I did it.

597
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,860
I'd never do that.

598
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,380
Okay, cool.

599
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,180
We see this all the time, and it's the times that I think that Alex is most keenly aware

600
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:29,560
the people in his communities might blow something up, and I think that this is a good strategy

601
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:35,260
for him to preemptively characterize anything as them false flagging in order to make us

602
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,700
look bad, but it's incessant.

603
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,900
He goes on this tip quite a bit.

604
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:46,260
And the enemy's next phase will be to frame us as terrorists or evil, and they will stage

605
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,840
terror attacks and blame it on us to then discredit any resistance.

606
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,520
But we need to be ahead of that and understand that, and there are other forms of civil disobedience

607
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,940
and things in the threat continuum of projection before we get to that point.

608
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:07,220
But it is our right, it is our duty to resist this by every means necessary.

609
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,100
And we are now at war for our very existence.

610
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,140
America is on the edge of death.

611
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:19,020
So if you understand that, kind of what he's saying is that the enemy is going to false

612
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,060
flag themselves in order to make Alex and his friends look bad, and they've got to be

613
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,060
careful about that.

614
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,180
But also, I should tell you that there's something called the threat continuum projection, and

615
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:32,100
then also we have the right to commit terror attacks if we want to.

616
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:37,260
Yeah, I'm confused as to how it is you can play a game like this where it's like, hey,

617
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,580
we would never do those terror attacks, it's a false flag.

618
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:46,060
But whenever, if it does happen, then the people are going to be like, yeah, good job,

619
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,500
we do terror attacks, we love terror attacks.

620
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,340
Is everybody a false flagger on the far right?

621
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,300
Is the entire far right, is all of the boogaloos a fucking false flag?

622
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,560
I think Alex thinks that.

623
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
That might be true.

624
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,740
Yeah, he said that they were like a cutout group or something.

625
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,420
Oh man.

626
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,420
Was that last-

627
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,420
I think he says that they're Antifa.

628
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:09,100
Was Larry Nichols' last act to false flag us with the Proud Boys and the others?

629
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
Oh no.

630
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
Do you think so?

631
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,100
Yeah, he did some witchcraft.

632
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
I think he might have.

633
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,900
Oh, speaking of which, I was going through, I was making that new drop, and so I was going

634
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,900
through these old folders of episodes, and whenever I do that, I end up finding something

635
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,220
that I had completely forgotten about.

636
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,700
Did you remember that a year ago, Alex was saying that the Queen had joined the Patriots'

637
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,700
side?

638
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,700
Do you remember that?

639
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,700
I do remember that!

640
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,700
What the shit?

641
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,700
That's right!

642
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,700
Yeah.

643
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,700
Oh, that's-

644
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,660
I completely forgot, and there was like a two-day stretch where Alex thought that the

645
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,660
Queen had succumbed to Donald Trump's side.

646
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,980
Yeah, I think that's going to be something fun.

647
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:53,140
If we ever do look back on these four years, like whenever it'll be funny again in 50,

648
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:58,000
we'll look back and we'll be like, at one point in time, Alex said literally everyone

649
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,980
he's hated before was a patriot, and also that he hates them later.

650
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,180
It's everyone.

651
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,180
It's everyone.

652
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,060
The Queen has flipped her dictator switch.

653
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,020
The Pope is evil, but the Pope likes it, and says, well, the Pope is good today.

654
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,200
But someone who Alex would never speak ill of-

655
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Stephen Miller?

656
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,500
Now, or 500 years from now, is his brother-in-law.

657
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,780
I don't know who this dude is.

658
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:24,140
But apparently his brother-in-law caught some election fraud.

659
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,140
So we have-

660
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,820
That's a good catch-fire.

661
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:34,160
We have Alex's wife's tennis partner informing us about Antifa attacks, and Alex's brother-in-law

662
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,940
coming in with some big scoops.

663
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,940
So helpful.

664
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:44,460
And then my own brother-in-law, who I've never seen get mad in the many years I've known

665
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:50,700
him, calls up shaking yesterday, and I go, what's wrong?

666
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,380
I just had 50 ballots.

667
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,100
He's down here at Congress, post office.

668
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,100
He had 50 of them.

669
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,100
He was filling them out as a name.

670
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
They were taking them.

671
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,100
They didn't do anything.

672
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,100
I said, why don't you videotape it?

673
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,100
Well, I'm in the post office.

674
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,100
It's a federal thing if you do that.

675
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,100
He just knows the law.

676
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,100
But let me see.

677
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,100
He followed the law.

678
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,100
They don't.

679
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,100
And he was shaking with anger.

680
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,100
I said, come on the air.

681
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,100
And he goes, well, I don't really want to do that.

682
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
I don't want to be on TV.

683
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,420
But I said, cut an audio piece.

684
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,420
Send me a voice memo.

685
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,420
He did.

686
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,420
We'll play it next time.

687
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:21,620
Don't you dare fucking give me a goddamn break.

688
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,420
It's against the law.

689
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,420
Yeah, I found globalists committing.

690
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,420
I saw Mass Motor Front and I was like, I follow the law.

691
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,820
I will not videotape his crime.

692
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:36,740
I would never, as a far right person, I would never videotape a crime.

693
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,740
Here's this thing that my brother-in-law yells about all the time.

694
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,700
I have proof that can make him look not crazy.

695
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,700
Oh, no.

696
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,700
I can't pull out my phone.

697
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,020
Don't you think there's a, if that really happened, there's a moment in his head where

698
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,500
he's like, nooo.

699
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,980
Well, here is his testimony because he did record an audio and it's meaningless.

700
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,700
I went to the post office today to drop off some packages with some products and there's

701
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,740
this guy there, real sketchy looking, and he had a grocery bag filled up with about

702
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,200
50 million ballots.

703
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,020
And he was taking pictures of them, taking pictures of himself and filling them out right

704
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,820
there on the counter.

705
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:21,140
And I could only see the ballot that he had in front of him on the counter and the one

706
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,660
on the top of the bag.

707
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,660
But they had the same signatures, same information on him.

708
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:31,940
And he was just taking pictures, doing one last check, marking some things and then putting

709
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,060
them straight in the ballot box right in front of everyone, right on the counter.

710
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,660
And no one did anything.

711
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,060
And I was thinking about doing something, but all I could think about was, you know,

712
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:46,980
me getting some kind of federal charge for interfering with the election with this guy,

713
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,660
putting in, you know, 50 ballots.

714
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,260
That is what you would be doing late, because I don't think they're supposed to accept them

715
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
now.

716
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,500
But I mean, if you have a lot of these people doing that, it's going to add up.

717
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:03,540
And the only reason you would do it is to try to overturn what the state has already

718
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,220
decided and Texas is red.

719
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:10,180
So one can only assume that these votes, all 50 of them are going to Joe Biden.

720
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:20,980
Ah, ah, ah, this, this guy shows, wow, I mean, he's the brother-in-law, so he's not related

721
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,980
by blood.

722
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:26,740
No, but there's something about being close to the Jones family that just makes you good

723
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,020
at figuring things out.

724
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,020
Good at investigating.

725
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:35,180
There's like something in their, in their family and their extended family that makes

726
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,460
them not jump to conclusions about stuff and really just get to the bottom of it.

727
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,460
I admire that.

728
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,980
If you need somebody to help you fill out your ballot, does that person also need to

729
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,060
sign the ballot?

730
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,060
They do.

731
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,060
Yeah.

732
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,740
I mean, this person could have been like a proxy or something.

733
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,580
Could have just gone to a nursing home.

734
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,580
Yeah.

735
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,580
That is a possibility.

736
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:57,340
Or I mean, if he's saying that this is like after election day, they might not have been

737
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,340
balanced.

738
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,340
They could just be anything.

739
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,220
I don't trust this guy's instincts.

740
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,220
Absolutely not.

741
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,100
I have no idea what he did or didn't see.

742
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,140
I don't even know if he's Alex's brother-in-law.

743
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,140
Quick question.

744
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,580
Did he mail in his ballot?

745
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,300
I doubt it.

746
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,740
Does he know what a mail in ballot would look like?

747
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,860
No idea.

748
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,200
I don't trust any of this.

749
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,180
And I love the part at the end there is like, the only reason you do this is to try and

750
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,500
change things.

751
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,720
And Texas went red.

752
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,620
So therefore all of these votes, all these votes that I have just decided are 50.

753
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,620
I didn't count them.

754
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,320
I have no fucking idea.

755
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,460
They must all be for, what if they're all for Trump?

756
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,460
Dumb, dumb.

757
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,460
You can't prove anything.

758
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:42,060
Furthermore, uh, Texas has already got, I suppose they hadn't called the other states

759
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,060
by this time.

760
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,060
Okay.

761
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,060
That's fair.

762
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:52,380
Alex tries to make sense of this, that they're being sent from Texas to other states.

763
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,780
You guys got to work on this.

764
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,860
If that's the case, I mean, it's 50 votes.

765
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,420
I don't know what kind of, I don't know.

766
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,420
I think this is stupid.

767
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,300
Trump won Texas by a million.

768
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,460
Anyway, Alex thinks that there's only one solution.

769
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,140
I think we just call for a new election.

770
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,140
Fair enough.

771
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,620
Uh, so he wants a new election.

772
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:16,340
I can't think of anything everyone in the United States agrees is the worst idea that

773
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,700
anyone could ever do.

774
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,700
Run it again.

775
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,900
More than let's do it again.

776
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,720
The most stressful time.

777
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,420
It doesn't matter what team you're on.

778
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,420
Don't do it again.

779
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,380
Well, just anything but that.

780
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,080
Okay, fine, fine.

781
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,980
Let's not do another election.

782
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,500
But how about we nullify this one?

783
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Okay.

784
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,500
But then we'll have to do it.

785
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,900
I'm playing all the clips when we come back, but I'm going to say this right now.

786
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,960
Whatever happens with Trump, he's done the right thing fighting this, but he didn't fight

787
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,020
the censorship like he should have.

788
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,740
But we're in the bed we're in now.

789
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,860
We're going to have to sleep in it.

790
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,340
But if we get the point out that it's a chai con globalist takeover and it's the end of

791
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,780
the country as we know it, and that it's illegal, not just that they're stealing the election,

792
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,540
but when you have Chinese and foreign backing, it nullifies what's happened.

793
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,260
And if we stand on that and say, oh, does it try to nullify Trump saying he was a Russian

794
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,660
with no proof?

795
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,540
We're going to nullify Biden a hundred percent.

796
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,580
We're going to demand Mitch McConnell and all of them do it and not have a fake investigation

797
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,000
because we've got him red handed being a chai con agent.

798
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,300
And that's what's so dangerous.

799
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,820
That's super constitutional.

800
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,740
Oh man, we're going to nullify his election and I'm going to have Mitch McConnell do it

801
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,300
without a trial because he's a red handed.

802
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,380
You know, if you're caught red handed, you still go to trial.

803
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,860
No, no, no, no, no.

804
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,960
It's like in the old west, if you get caught killing somebody, they just hang you right

805
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
then and there.

806
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
It's that simple.

807
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,540
If you get caught in the act, you're still called an alleged killer.

808
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,020
Nope, Nope.

809
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,500
Unless you're a far right murderer.

810
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,660
In which case, well, of course you didn't even actually do it.

811
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,660
Here's a false flag.

812
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,860
Um, so yeah, I guess Alex wants to know this.

813
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,860
This isn't going to work.

814
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,860
I don't think so.

815
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,860
I don't think so.

816
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:04,180
Now, one thing that I thought was really strange was this is like all, like I said, flat, feels

817
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,180
like nothing.

818
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:10,820
Um, and then Alex has a guest on and this guest, I don't know what the fuck he was doing.

819
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:17,620
So this person is named Amanda Milius and she is the daughter of John Milius.

820
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:22,100
He's the director of Conan the Barbarian, Apocalypse Now, and of course Red Dawn, Alex's

821
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,260
favorite documentary, Red Dawn.

822
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,180
He was the director of Apocalypse Now?

823
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,180
Or maybe producer.

824
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,180
I'm not sure.

825
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,180
He was involved in Apocalypse Now.

826
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,180
Okay.

827
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:35,060
I was going to say, because there's a pretty famous guy who directed Apocalypse Now that

828
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,060
wasn't that guy.

829
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,940
If you researched into it and it turns out that it wasn't him at all, then we've got

830
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,940
a whole story.

831
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,300
He might not have directed any of those.

832
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,140
He might have produced them or wrote them or something, screenplay.

833
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,140
He's involved.

834
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,140
He's in the mix.

835
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,140
He's involved.

836
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,140
Whatever.

837
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:58,040
So Amanda, she's become a Trump propagandist and she just released a film called The Plot

838
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,700
Against the President.

839
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,460
And so she is in, and she has some interesting things to talk about.

840
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,500
I love the smell of...

841
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,860
You were a huge part of why I left Hollywood.

842
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:14,580
I was listening to Info Wars all the time and I left and I volunteered in 2016 in Nevada,

843
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,060
which by the way, Nevada is a huge battleground for us right now.

844
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,460
Nevada is where everything's happening.

845
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,580
And I ended up leaving Hollywood completely and joining the Trump administration, working

846
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,580
at the State Department.

847
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,120
How proud is your family of you?

848
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
They're pretty happy.

849
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,620
You were already being successful in Hollywood.

850
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,220
I admire the fact that you cut bait with those guys.

851
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,340
Not to be a dick, but Amanda Milius is not somebody who you would say walked away from

852
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,640
a vibrant career in Hollywood.

853
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,700
If you check out her IMDb page, she has two primary credits as a director, one being this

854
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,540
new Trump film and the other one a 2015 short called The Lotus Gun.

855
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:54,580
Her only credits as a performer are as herself in a documentary about her dad and appearances

856
00:38:54,580 --> 00:39:00,860
on Tucker Carlson and Sebastian Gorka's shows, most likely promoting Trump and her new propaganda

857
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,860
film.

858
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,860
That would make sense.

859
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,500
It's all good to do this interview and be like, hey, look at this famous, you know,

860
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,140
movie person's daughter who likes Trump, but it's entirely another thing to pretend that

861
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:14,020
she was like an A or B or even C list person and then walked away from it to get on board

862
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,020
with Trump.

863
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,820
That's insulting to her and to us as listeners.

864
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,460
Look at this important movie person.

865
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:24,260
Of course, his daughter, independent of his success, has also become a massive success

866
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,380
in the film industry.

867
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,380
What was that?

868
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,380
No.

869
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,380
Oh shit.

870
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,380
Yeah.

871
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,380
And you heard her.

872
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,380
She said she worked in the State Department.

873
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,380
Yeah.

874
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,380
She apparently was involved in Trump's State Department.

875
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,060
She had some kind of a role in that.

876
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:40,660
And so there is a feeling of her being here almost in an official capacity and the fact

877
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:45,860
that she made this Trump propaganda film that you just released while she had been working

878
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:51,000
at the State Department is just a, just a bizarre, um, it seems inappropriate.

879
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,740
I don't think someone with less than my resume should work at the State Department.

880
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,780
And I don't think I should work at the State Department, Dan.

881
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,540
I don't, I don't know what was going on, but everything felt wrong about this.

882
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,540
Yeah.

883
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,020
And then it got even worse because we introduced another weirdo into the mix.

884
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,020
All right.

885
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,020
So you can introduce you better than I can.

886
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,340
I love Ali Alexander.

887
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,180
He's been on fire a long time, but you were talking about how you just suddenly brought

888
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,380
all this together and reached out as a catalyst.

889
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,380
He months ago was saying, stop the still getting it ready.

890
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,400
But he is an example to others.

891
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,360
He just reached out, got a bunch of key people together and now this is a super viral movement.

892
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,460
So Ali Alexander is this, uh, you know, the zealot weirdo who's been coming on Alex's

893
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,240
show a bit lately.

894
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,300
And now he's involved in something called stop the steal, which is, you know, they're

895
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,580
doing the, you know, I don't know, it's maybe the catchphrase of a lot of these totally

896
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:44,740
not astroturfed, uh, 100% grassroots.

897
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,740
I don't care.

898
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,740
Whatever.

899
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,740
Yeah.

900
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,740
I'm more interested in the fact that I only remember this because we just talked about

901
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,740
it.

902
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,820
Stop the steal was the name of the thing that Roger Stone was involved in in 2016.

903
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,980
Yeah, exactly.

904
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:02,700
Jesus Christ, that was Roger Stone's whole thing that he got sued about.

905
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:09,540
Oh man, 2016 is the year all their evil tricks worked in 2020 is the year they almost worked.

906
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,180
Like that's, but everybody found them far more disappointing and sad this time.

907
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,780
But it's also super weird.

908
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,020
Like it's the same name.

909
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,020
It's the same name.

910
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,020
Why?

911
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,020
What are you going to copyright it for your, for your protest movement?

912
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,420
It seems very strange to me.

913
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:26,920
It makes me wonder if Roger is somehow involved, but I have no idea.

914
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,920
He is nowhere to be found.

915
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,060
Does Roger still have the email address?

916
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,940
Stop the steal at Gmail?

917
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,940
At Yahoo?

918
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,940
Yeah, probably.

919
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:41,060
Um, so Ali wants sort of the same thing Alex wants, which is a new election, but only in

920
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,660
the States that Trump lost.

921
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,660
What?

922
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,580
Well, because there can't be a recount, you know?

923
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:51,160
Unfortunately even winning, uh, Nevada wouldn't put us over the top.

924
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,300
That puts us at two 65 or two 66.

925
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,860
We have to win Pennsylvania and look, I know it's not popular.

926
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:01,820
The Republican party doesn't want me to say this, but we need a revote in Wisconsin and

927
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,580
we need a revote in Michigan.

928
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:07,940
The fraud is so wrought there and we are going to get a recount in, in Wisconsin, but here's

929
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,940
what I'm afraid of.

930
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,940
Alex.

931
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:17,420
I think the Democrats have baited us into a rigged recount on recount trap guys, classic

932
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,000
recount guys.

933
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,940
You just lost it.

934
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,680
We didn't bait you into a recount trap.

935
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,420
No one wants a recount.

936
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,420
It's a classic recap.

937
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,420
That's not even a thing.

938
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,420
That's not even a thing.

939
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,540
That's a recount trap.

940
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,540
It's a set up.

941
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,300
When was the last recount trap that happened?

942
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,220
Every election since Hoover.

943
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:44,020
This is what he thinks the Democrats big prestige is at the end of the film.

944
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,220
They're like, ha ha.

945
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,000
And we wanted you to do the recount the whole time.

946
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,940
We won the state and we want you to force a recap so we can also win again more so we

947
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,580
can win more this time.

948
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,100
Cool, Ali.

949
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,980
Can't imagine why the Republican party doesn't want you talking for him.

950
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,980
Strange.

951
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,100
Yeah, he believes Ali believes that Trump's just got to seize power.

952
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,900
Well, we certainly need to use the full weight of the federal government.

953
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,280
And and what we got to do is we the people have to say you have a mandate to do that.

954
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,360
President Trump got more votes than any candidate in American history.

955
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,340
The idea just just visualize this.

956
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:26,180
Go to your child and ask him, do you think that Joe Biden would be the top vote getter

957
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,820
in American history?

958
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,100
No, nobody believes that.

959
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,400
And so we know that it's rigged.

960
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,900
They just had a plus one system rigged in every Republican ballot that came in.

961
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,540
They found a dead person.

962
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,460
They found a covid ballot.

963
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:43,340
Somebody did a mail in ballot and then voted in on Election Day, too.

964
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,340
They rigged the election.

965
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,660
There's no body who's going to believe that Joe Biden is the most popular politician in

966
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,660
American history.

967
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,700
I agree with you.

968
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,900
One from you, two for me.

969
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,660
So, so did.

970
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,660
So excuse me.

971
00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:01,540
We just did we win by what, 66 percent of the popular vote must have.

972
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,700
Yeah, this is dumb.

973
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:08,940
I would say don't ask your child this question and then assume anything, because, you know

974
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,620
what, a lot of trivia is surprising.

975
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,620
Yeah, yeah.

976
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,860
And sometimes you'll be surprised by facts.

977
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:19,140
Ask like a six year old with no prior actual experience and really no understanding of

978
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,700
the American system at all, whether or not Biden would be the most popular candidate

979
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,700
in history.

980
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:28,100
I guarantee that no one would think that in a bubble, Biden would get the most votes of

981
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,100
anybody ever.

982
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:34,180
But I think given the circumstances, yes, if you look at the context, it makes a little

983
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,180
more sense.

984
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:40,620
And if you consider like how a lot of that is voting against Trump, it makes sense.

985
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,620
Yeah.

986
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,620
Yeah.

987
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,620
Yeah.

988
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:47,140
But so Ali is like, yeah, Trump had to have won because you can't imagine even a child

989
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,940
couldn't imagine that someone likes Biden more.

990
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,940
Yeah.

991
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,940
That's not good thinking.

992
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,580
Oh, no, that's that's real bad.

993
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,580
This guy sucks.

994
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,220
And he leaves.

995
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:02,020
And Amanda and Alex start talking about, like, what happened with Drudge, man?

996
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,820
Drudge is Drudge is gone.

997
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,820
Oh, guys.

998
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,140
He doesn't like us anymore.

999
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,140
Guys.

1000
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,320
What happened to Drudge?

1001
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,700
You tell me, you know, everybody thinks he was kidnapped and there's somebody else in

1002
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,420
place because this is very bizarre.

1003
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,420
His behavior this year.

1004
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,420
It's very weird.

1005
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,180
It's not helpful is what it is.

1006
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,060
But whatever his game is, I'm not super into it.

1007
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,060
But but anyway.

1008
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,060
But yeah.

1009
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,060
I'm not into it either.

1010
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,460
I mean, was he blackmailed?

1011
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,460
Was he kidnapped?

1012
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,340
I mean, they're willing to do anything.

1013
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,700
No, I think.

1014
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,700
He was at the White House.

1015
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,700
Somebody didn't listen to him.

1016
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,700
He saw some betrayals.

1017
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,700
He got really pissed.

1018
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,260
They weren't standing up against censorship.

1019
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:44,740
And Steve Bannon through the grapevine told me that CNN leased it and that CNN.

1020
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,740
That's what it seems like.

1021
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,740
CNN leased it.

1022
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:51,700
But then I was like, OK, I was like, I don't believe Steve Bannon because what Roger Stone

1023
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,700
said.

1024
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,140
I think Steve overall is a good guy.

1025
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,140
I don't want to be mad at him.

1026
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,140
I don't want to have fights with people.

1027
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,140
I'm not trying to be a Washington guy.

1028
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,140
I don't care.

1029
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,140
I don't get in the middle of it.

1030
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:04,420
But then I look at CNN and then I look at Drudge and it's it's their flavor.

1031
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,420
It's their signature.

1032
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,420
It is.

1033
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,420
It is.

1034
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,420
It matches very, very well.

1035
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,420
Yeah.

1036
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,420
Drudge Report's now CNN.

1037
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,420
Yeah.

1038
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,420
Drudge Report's now CNN.

1039
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,420
They're leasing it.

1040
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,420
Man.

1041
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:20,260
When we go back to the stakes where it's like he's saying nonsense like Drudge Report is

1042
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:23,620
leasing, Drudge is leasing the Drudge Report to CNN.

1043
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,620
Yeah.

1044
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,180
But what's the contract like?

1045
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:31,180
What's the seriously clandestine contract to because you can't release an option to

1046
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,180
extend?

1047
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,180
No point.

1048
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,180
Yeah.

1049
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,180
Is it hard?

1050
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,920
Look, does everybody get to share or is it like the Super Bowl thing where you can only

1051
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,720
buy ads at a certain time?

1052
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,180
Let's pretend this means anything.

1053
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,180
OK.

1054
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:49,820
If this does mean something, then imagine that the hero of your media sphere, the guy

1055
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:55,420
who has directed the course of conservative talk radio for the last like 20 years since

1056
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:59,460
the Clinton days, the guy who can make or break people.

1057
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,460
One hundred percent.

1058
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:04,700
The guy who brought us Andrew Breitbart and therefore brought us Breitbart, brought us

1059
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,700
James O'Keefe.

1060
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,700
You got it.

1061
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,140
The guy who's like responsible for so many shitheads.

1062
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,140
Yeah.

1063
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,180
He's also someone whose site you can lease.

1064
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:17,780
See, but that's something that I think they would buy.

1065
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,860
Well, that would be like I'm a grifter.

1066
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,860
He's a grifter.

1067
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,460
But that would kind of implies that he's had a lease prior.

1068
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,460
Yeah.

1069
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,660
Who is he leased out to prior?

1070
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:29,060
Who is he working for?

1071
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,300
Murdoch can't afford his prices anymore.

1072
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,520
Now it's just CNN.

1073
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,520
Is that the implication?

1074
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,820
I think that might be the implication.

1075
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:39,540
Wrestle with that, Alex, because I think Alex actually kind of touched on what probably

1076
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:44,980
could be a reasonable explanation, and that is that Drudge got led in a little bit, saw

1077
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:50,420
the disorder, saw the quote unquote betrayals, recognized that Trump wasn't taking the issues

1078
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:54,900
of like online censorship seriously, which is something that he would be super interested

1079
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,420
in given his brand and his entire market space.

1080
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,420
You would think.

1081
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:04,460
And so he followed his principle, which is I can't support this anymore or whatever.

1082
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,940
I mean, the guy wants to get rid of 230.

1083
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:13,580
I aggregate conservative media, so I am fucked if they do that.

1084
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,580
Yeah.

1085
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,060
I'm a single issue voter.

1086
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,060
Yeah.

1087
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,060
Yeah.

1088
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,060
And your guy is going to kill my business.

1089
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,060
Exactly.

1090
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,060
Yeah.

1091
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,060
Yeah.

1092
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,420
And so I think that Alex kind of recognized, he kind of gave up the game that he understands

1093
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,740
actually what's going on.

1094
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,740
Yeah.

1095
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,900
But you've got to play some fun thing with like he's getting leased out by CNN or he's

1096
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,900
kidnapped or blackmailed or whatever.

1097
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,300
Have a fun time with that.

1098
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,180
No, whatever, dudes.

1099
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:44,180
So there's another question, not only what's up with Matt Drudge, what's up with Trump?

1100
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,180
Where's he been?

1101
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:49,060
Let me ask you this question, because you are an insider for the Patriot movement.

1102
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:54,300
I was flipping out the day after the election saying, OK, he gave a three a.m. speech.

1103
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,600
It was amazing.

1104
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:01,220
I want to see him Oval Office addressing every fraud, fireside chat, graphs showing it, you

1105
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:02,220
know, Gateway pun.

1106
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,020
And I think some of the best job overall analysis and force on video the best.

1107
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,020
But I don't care.

1108
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,020
I just want to win.

1109
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,700
He should be up there showing it.

1110
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,240
But then he's been dead silent for a day and a half.

1111
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,860
And then talking to the crew, they all separately.

1112
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,860
I went to different offices.

1113
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,540
I respect people's actual view, I say, because I was missing.

1114
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,540
I'm like, where is he?

1115
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,540
He needs to be up front attacking.

1116
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,540
Yeah, they go.

1117
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,880
He's waiting for the people to mobilize and he's going to see what we do.

1118
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,880
It's now up to us.

1119
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,580
And I think that clicked.

1120
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,100
Is that an accurate statement?

1121
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:33,380
That is a great leader.

1122
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:40,360
As our fearless leader, he has decided to allow us to choose what he will do based upon

1123
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,540
our disorganized actions.

1124
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,740
I've concocted a way to look at this.

1125
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:49,260
So if shit goes bad, it's kind of our fault.

1126
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:55,940
Trump put the ball in our court and we just didn't storm the buildings or something.

1127
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:56,940
Trump is a genius.

1128
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:59,700
He's just saying, hey, people, you do whatever you to do.

1129
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,700
What a leader.

1130
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,700
It is.

1131
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,700
It is.

1132
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,700
You know what?

1133
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:10,560
I'm almost I'm almost like, God damn it, America can't even get a good dictate, a good dictator.

1134
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,780
Like we're just shitty people.

1135
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:14,260
We're just shitty people who got a shitty dictator.

1136
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:19,740
Other places know how to get a fucking dictator, you know, like Russia's had 30 dictators.

1137
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,140
They know what they're doing.

1138
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,860
It's it's it's a little strange.

1139
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:30,220
The the the sort of the position that Alex has put in is like he's he's he's presented

1140
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:34,140
this guy is like strong, competent and a good leader.

1141
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:41,700
And now in a position where like the everything is pretty uncertain, things are tense.

1142
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,500
There's election counting going on.

1143
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,500
Trump's nowhere to be found.

1144
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,020
No, he's not assuming a leadership position.

1145
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,520
Oh, that's right.

1146
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,020
The thing he's supposed to do.

1147
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,020
Yeah.

1148
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,020
Yeah.

1149
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,820
And you can do that without asserting power or claiming you won the election.

1150
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:59,460
You can still be visible and say, you know, this is going along.

1151
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,520
The process is moving.

1152
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,860
We support the vote counters.

1153
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,860
Totally.

1154
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:07,260
You know, there is a way to do that and still give the appearance that someone's here, someone's

1155
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,260
in charge.

1156
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,860
And instead, no, Alex even recognizes, I don't fucking know.

1157
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,260
I don't know if I've seen Trump since election night.

1158
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,260
Yeah.

1159
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,580
And no one knows what to do.

1160
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:20,460
And if you look at all of the people on the like, this is maybe another thing that we

1161
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:24,700
got lucky with because Trump's such an actually shitty leader.

1162
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:29,260
Everybody went apeshit in their own little pockets, like throughout all of election night.

1163
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,900
And as the votes have come in and they they declared it for Biden, you see more of those

1164
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:36,660
little pockets of everybody frantically discussing with all their friends.

1165
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,660
But there's no unified, yeah, we're going to do this.

1166
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:40,660
It's everybody separate.

1167
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,500
Like, I don't know what to do.

1168
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,860
Q hasn't said anything.

1169
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:44,860
I don't know what to do.

1170
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,860
I don't know what to do.

1171
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,860
You don't say anything.

1172
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:47,860
I don't know.

1173
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:48,860
We have no leaders.

1174
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:49,860
Yeah.

1175
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:54,140
And actually, that leads us to our next clip, because there's a phenomenon that Amanda discusses

1176
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,760
that I think is really interesting.

1177
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,760
Power vacuum.

1178
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,300
Cernovich got to Arizona in like, what, like a couple hours?

1179
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,980
Like he was like, I'm there, I'm going.

1180
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,980
And he gathered all those people and did it.

1181
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,980
I mean, that's what's happening right now is everybody's putting aside any kind of,

1182
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:12,140
you know, critiques of the administration or whatever's happening.

1183
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:15,940
And they're just they're just jumping in, because this moment is everything.

1184
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,100
She repeats that a number of times about, like, people like Mike Cernovich and Jack

1185
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,980
Posobach and all these people, these influencers, not Alex.

1186
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,500
Well, they're all on.

1187
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,620
Alex is presumably on the same page because you haven't like Ali Alexander on another

1188
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:33,500
one of these figures who they all put aside their differences and they're like, we got

1189
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,780
to do something right.

1190
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:35,940
It's like, yeah, no shit.

1191
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,940
They are.

1192
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:37,940
Their game is over.

1193
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,940
Yeah.

1194
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:39,940
They have to.

1195
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:44,700
They all recognize that the door is closing on the scams they've been running.

1196
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,700
Right.

1197
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,100
Much like Drudge is like, hey, fuck Trump.

1198
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,220
He's going to destroy my business.

1199
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:53,060
Cernovich is like, I think we should probably start a war because they're fucking up my

1200
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,060
business.

1201
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,060
Yeah.

1202
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,060
Yeah.

1203
00:52:56,060 --> 00:53:00,820
And we're just like, we're going to very quickly not have much relevance.

1204
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,820
Yeah.

1205
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,820
Yeah.

1206
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,820
Yeah.

1207
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:04,820
We're going to be in the opposition.

1208
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:05,820
Right.

1209
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:11,980
Uh, there's already, I guess I could just be an MRA guy again or I could be, do my pickup

1210
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,440
artist thing again, maybe.

1211
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,940
Just get your real estate license.

1212
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:15,940
Shit.

1213
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,940
Cernovich.

1214
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,940
He's a lawyer.

1215
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,940
Cernovich.

1216
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:19,940
Just sell houses.

1217
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,940
He's technically a lawyer.

1218
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,940
Yeah.

1219
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,940
Yeah.

1220
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:23,940
He should sell houses.

1221
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,940
Sure.

1222
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,940
Why not?

1223
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:26,940
Um, yeah.

1224
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:27,940
And I think that phenomenon is kind of interesting.

1225
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,140
I don't experience it because I don't know what any of these ding dongs are up to privately,

1226
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:33,900
but it is, it is interesting to hear her say like, oh, everyone's putting their, their

1227
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,900
heads together.

1228
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:35,900
They can't, they have to figure out how to survive.

1229
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:36,900
What's our new scam.

1230
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:37,900
Yeah.

1231
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:38,900
The, the swamp is congealed.

1232
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,580
How do we, how do we escape this?

1233
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,580
Yeah.

1234
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,180
Uh, let's claim Laura Loomer actually won.

1235
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,180
Yeah.

1236
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,340
That is, that is, that's so stupid.

1237
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:52,300
They because, Oh man, here's the great thing about later on.

1238
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,140
And here's my, here's my guess.

1239
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:59,260
We're going to see a very close parallel between what happens at info wars whenever Alex has

1240
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:02,980
gone and what happens in the far right whenever Trump has gone.

1241
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:06,620
I think there'll be some, some fractioning, you know, some of them are competent.

1242
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:10,940
I think there'll be some splintering off, but you'll see, you'll see kind of, I think

1243
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:14,040
what's going to happen to everybody is basically what's happened to people who've been kicked

1244
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,040
off Twitter.

1245
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,040
Yeah.

1246
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:20,100
It's just like they will sort of spiral a little bit and be like, even if you had a

1247
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,580
platform, this is worse.

1248
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,580
Yeah.

1249
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:28,300
Um, and, and I think that, you know, you'll really see the difference between people who

1250
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,500
have something and are safe and are not.

1251
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,260
People like Jack Posobick and Mike Cernovich are not secure.

1252
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,660
I don't think they're stable in their media position.

1253
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:45,740
People like Ben Shapiro or Alex, they are, they're, they're like, Alex has some issues

1254
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:51,260
to iron out and figure out what he's going to do, but he also has millions and a gigantic

1255
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,840
media operation.

1256
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,420
Like he's going to be able to figure out something to do.

1257
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:56,660
It might be embarrassing as hell.

1258
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:00,340
He might lose a bunch of his audience, but he'll figure out something.

1259
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:04,820
Ben Shapiro's probably going to be embarrassed for a little bit, but he'll be fine.

1260
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:05,820
Yeah.

1261
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:06,820
He'll be fine.

1262
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:07,820
He'll figure out something to do.

1263
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:08,820
He'll become a different type of mass asshole.

1264
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:09,820
Yeah.

1265
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:14,580
Jack Posobick is going to keep working at like what, these, these fringe OAN type outlets.

1266
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,580
Probably.

1267
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,580
There's just nowhere.

1268
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,060
There's no path forward there.

1269
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:22,020
Speaking of people who are going to be fine, I think because they just have a big enough

1270
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,020
brand.

1271
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,020
James O'Keefe comes on.

1272
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,620
You think James O'Keefe is going to be fine, huh?

1273
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:26,620
Yes.

1274
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,620
I think he's going to be fine.

1275
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:32,260
I think he has enough of a brand and name recognition inside of like the larger conservative

1276
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,260
sphere.

1277
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,260
Sure.

1278
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,580
That he could sort of abandon a lot of these like things that are tailored to the Trump

1279
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,620
base and he could be fine.

1280
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:44,780
He'll, I think he, he's, if you're associated with Andrew Breitbart personally, I don't

1281
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:48,540
think you're ever going to be like, yeah, yeah, there'll be, there'll be a way for you

1282
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,940
to keep failing upwards.

1283
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:50,940
Yeah.

1284
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:55,620
He comes on with a terrible phone connection and he's just talking about voter fraud.

1285
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:59,300
It's really hard to listen to because the voter, sorry, the phone line is awful.

1286
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:00,300
Yeah.

1287
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,440
And then it's also very sad.

1288
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,680
It honestly comes off less about like he's trying to prove some kind of claim.

1289
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,600
It seems more like he has this narrative that he wants to sell to people and he's trying

1290
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:14,620
to recruit other people to play the role of whistleblowers for him, like to use them as

1291
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,340
props.

1292
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:17,340
He's multi-level marketing.

1293
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,340
Yeah.

1294
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,340
Yeah.

1295
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,340
Would you like to be a prop in my next?

1296
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:21,340
Absolutely.

1297
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,500
And you can recruit three more people to be props in yours.

1298
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,500
Yeah.

1299
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:30,340
But what we need today is more people at the polls, people who are poll watchers, people

1300
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:34,300
who handle ballots to blow the whistle in an army of whistleblowers.

1301
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,100
I can't emphasize this enough.

1302
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:39,180
Now is the time today, tonight for you to do this.

1303
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,180
Absolutely.

1304
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,180
Don't wait.

1305
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:43,420
Our destiny, our future, our, our very birthright's being stolen.

1306
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:47,340
So yeah, he's just trying to enlist people to come like be, be a guest star in my next

1307
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,340
video.

1308
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,980
It seems like a, the way he gets all of his quote, whistleblowers.

1309
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:51,980
Yeah.

1310
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:52,980
Yeah.

1311
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:53,980
I found it very uninteresting.

1312
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:54,980
Yeah.

1313
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:58,860
So Alex has now decided at this point in the show, I got to go somewhere.

1314
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:01,900
Cernovich went to Arizona and people seem to enjoy that.

1315
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:02,900
Yeah.

1316
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,460
There's people yelling in States.

1317
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,060
This is still wet concrete.

1318
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,060
Yeah.

1319
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,180
We could still do something.

1320
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,180
Sure.

1321
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:15,100
There's still some attention and Arizona seems like it's getting closer.

1322
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:19,600
So that might be one where we actually might eke out a win and Maricopa County's the home

1323
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,060
of Joe Arpaio, who I also love so much.

1324
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,060
I hope he dies.

1325
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:26,900
Um, and so Alex decides he's got to go somewhere, but he doesn't know where

1326
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:33,340
I feel like I'm in Las Eisley spaceport, go to Los Eisley, what airplane to get on where

1327
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:39,020
I'm going to go because there's no way I can sit back while this is going on.

1328
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:45,060
Should I go to Arizona or should I go to Georgia or should I go to Michigan?

1329
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,980
God almighty.

1330
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,820
You ever try to fly direct from Los Eisley to Arizona?

1331
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:51,820
It's hellish.

1332
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:52,820
It's a long flight.

1333
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:53,820
It's a long flight.

1334
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:54,820
It's a long flight.

1335
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:55,820
Yeah.

1336
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:56,820
You're going to have to take a couple of stops.

1337
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:00,580
And you wind up in a wretched hive of scum and villainy.

1338
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,580
Yeah.

1339
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:06,660
So Alex, you know, we all know that he eventually ends up going to Arizona, but he has a really

1340
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,660
difficult time figuring out where to go.

1341
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,660
Sure.

1342
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:13,660
And now as the show goes on too, like earlier, he was kind of just like puzzling over why

1343
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:16,420
Trump is not appearing right anywhere.

1344
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,980
And he's kind of like, Hey, he's just letting the people act.

1345
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:19,980
That was earlier.

1346
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:20,980
Yeah.

1347
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,700
As the show goes on, he starts to get a little bit mad about the fact that Trump is hiding.

1348
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,700
Wow.

1349
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:30,300
It begins Democrat lawmakers call on Twitter to remove us president from the platform because

1350
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:35,980
he's not giving speeches, but you're a hundred times more viral.

1351
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,020
Where is the president?

1352
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,380
We haven't seen him unless I'm wrong crew.

1353
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:43,740
Your watch as much as I do or more, a lot more eyeballs than I do.

1354
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:50,780
I got two eyeballs, two eyeball at four, six, eight, like 12, 14 eyeballs in there.

1355
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:56,060
Has Trump been seen since three 30 in the morning on a Wednesday?

1356
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:59,340
Just asking, you know, we're talking 36 hours ago.

1357
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,660
Has anybody seen the president?

1358
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,580
Did the cookie monster eat him?

1359
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:09,180
Oh, cookie, I mean, I mean, where, where is the president?

1360
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,340
Where is the president?

1361
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:13,860
I've tried to like defend the president and I love the president and I think he overalls

1362
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:14,860
in a great job.

1363
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:21,820
And I, but I mean, we're in the middle of the Alamo war here and we ain't seen Colonel

1364
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:26,540
Travis in a day and a half, huh?

1365
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:29,520
Just like the real Colonel Travis, he's off drunk somewhere.

1366
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,580
I mean like, I don't know.

1367
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:35,780
I don't take fault with that thought like devoid of anything else he's saying.

1368
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:41,640
It's like, yeah, you should be, you should be frustrated that Trump isn't really guiding

1369
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,640
the folks.

1370
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:47,960
Is that, is that why, what if all of those predictions of like Trumpism is never going

1371
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,660
to leave us or are all countered by the fact that we didn't expect them to eventually be

1372
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:55,700
like, Hey, Trump sucks at this.

1373
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,700
Hmm.

1374
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:57,700
I think so.

1375
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:03,140
When he finally betrays them at the end, they're finally like, Oh shit, we got conned.

1376
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,520
Well, no.

1377
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:08,860
I think a lot of the underlying things are what you have to be more worried about and

1378
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:16,220
someone who isn't as much of a very clear con man carrying out some of those political

1379
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:21,260
things and the flaws that in our system that Trump has exploited, the recognizing that

1380
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:27,420
there is no reason to not act like a dick hole and there are no reason to follow norms

1381
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:33,420
apparently because well, decent people do unwritten rules are just things that people

1382
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,420
whine about.

1383
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,420
Yeah.

1384
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:39,660
So people have generally been beholden to a lot of those things and I think Trump has

1385
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:43,300
really exposed that there's no reason to follow them.

1386
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,540
There's no consequence for breaking any of them.

1387
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,540
Totally.

1388
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:50,540
I mean, even in baseball, if you do a bat flip to agree, just you get hit in the back

1389
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:52,380
with a bit of a fastball.

1390
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,380
Well, yeah.

1391
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,380
I will.

1392
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,380
Okay.

1393
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,380
We get to hit Trump in the back with a fastball.

1394
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,780
I think that's fine with a 97 mile an hour.

1395
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:02,900
Someone who's less of a very overt con man and someone who's a lot more capable and has

1396
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:08,940
the same sort of policies that appeal to people who recognize the ways in which they can break

1397
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,260
unwritten rules and stuff.

1398
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,540
And that's kind of what you more have to be really worried about.

1399
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:15,940
And I think that those people will again fall for that.

1400
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:16,940
Yeah.

1401
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:17,940
It's not hard.

1402
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:18,940
No.

1403
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:22,340
So Alex, he's like, fuck, I need to go somewhere.

1404
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:26,820
I haven't seen Trump on TV in a long time.

1405
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:29,260
I'm going to fucking take a nap.

1406
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:34,100
Maybe I'm going to get a jet airplane to fly me up to DC.

1407
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,060
That's where I need to be.

1408
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:42,340
See, I'm ready to take action that I'm trying to like, I can't overanalyze this.

1409
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:47,580
I have to, I have to go to my sleepy place.

1410
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,500
That's the joke of a meme of that.

1411
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:53,620
But I mean, I have to like, I literally, I'll go take a 30 minute nap sometimes and go,

1412
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:54,620
what is the answer to something?

1413
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:57,180
And I go to bed and then I'll have a dream of what to do.

1414
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:01,860
So I got to get dialed into my subconscious, allow show secret sauce there.

1415
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,740
And I think I got to sleep here.

1416
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:08,880
I got to have the engine turn off with in my mind.

1417
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,880
What do I do?

1418
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:10,880
And I'll wake up with the answer.

1419
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,180
Is it DC?

1420
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,920
Is it Georgia?

1421
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,160
Is it Arizona?

1422
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,500
Is it Detroit?

1423
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,620
I don't know.

1424
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,500
Go to hell.

1425
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:30,460
But I mean, I just can't sit here with this amount of history going down and do nothing.

1426
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:35,060
I've got to take action.

1427
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:39,380
Oh my God.

1428
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:47,860
I just love the idea that he's sitting here.

1429
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:48,860
I got to do something.

1430
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,660
I just, there's so much history going on.

1431
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:51,660
I got to do something.

1432
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,020
I'm going to take a nap.

1433
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,220
I think I'll dream my solution.

1434
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:04,140
The reason that this show is, I do recognize that even, you know, with Trump not being

1435
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:07,700
in power, I'm still entirely fascinated by Alex.

1436
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:11,380
And the reason is that this show is like, it's a compelling psychodrama.

1437
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:12,380
It is.

1438
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:13,380
It is.

1439
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:17,220
We're in the next season where he's just confused for the next year.

1440
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:21,660
Well, I think he'll be confused for a bit, but I think he'll land quicker than that.

1441
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,060
Maybe he should just go to Tibet.

1442
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:25,140
I hear that's where people find themselves.

1443
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,140
Let Owen take over.

1444
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:27,140
Yeah.

1445
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,140
Yeah, totally.

1446
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:30,300
Just become a fucking Buddhist out there.

1447
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:31,300
Just do it.

1448
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,300
Calm down.

1449
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,300
Relax.

1450
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:34,300
Live your life a little bit.

1451
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:35,300
That certainly would be interesting.

1452
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,300
Yeah.

1453
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:37,300
But there's a 30% chance that he won't need to do that.

1454
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:38,300
Okay.

1455
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:42,860
I'd give Trump a 30% chance we pull this out, prove the fraud.

1456
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,420
But no, it's, we're a judge nation.

1457
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,980
Nobody came for those babies getting chopped up, 62 million of them.

1458
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:55,420
Nobody came for all the kids getting kidnapped by the left, putting torture rings.

1459
01:03:55,420 --> 01:04:00,580
And so we just had it good too long and God's sick of us not caring and not being involved.

1460
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,740
God says, I'm going to burn you now.

1461
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:04,740
Whoa.

1462
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,220
You got to get a better God, man.

1463
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:08,700
So I guess we've been judged and we're going to burn.

1464
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,940
God is really, really turning on a hairpin these days.

1465
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:17,460
30% chance that's not going to happen though if Trump somehow proves that the election

1466
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:18,460
fraud.

1467
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,060
He will stay God's hair.

1468
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,060
Proves it.

1469
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,060
Good God.

1470
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,060
Yeah.

1471
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,060
What are we doing?

1472
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:30,300
So apparently Patriots are being culled from the internet and Alex has a familiar thing

1473
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:33,420
happened to him as he's trying to discuss this.

1474
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:37,500
They're going through everybody that's been identified as a Patriot for this coup and

1475
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,160
they're blocking and freezing or banning your account.

1476
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,540
This is a takeover.

1477
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:46,040
When the lights go out, the communications go out, that's when the troops start coming

1478
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,020
down to the parachutes, metaphysically.

1479
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,020
Well, this is it.

1480
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:51,120
This is the bigger soul.

1481
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,120
At least you're full grown adults.

1482
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,660
You're not a baby in the womb, got chopped up, didn't have a chance.

1483
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:57,180
So we deserve what's about to happen.

1484
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:07,380
Get close to Jesus and wake up or get your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye.

1485
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,700
Go ahead and play that report.

1486
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,980
The one that Rob do gave us where it's like five minutes long, but we're gonna play the

1487
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:15,140
one where I predict all of the stuff is now happening.

1488
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:16,900
That was the one I talked about.

1489
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:19,500
We have that.

1490
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,500
Also need for that either.

1491
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,500
No need for that either.

1492
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,620
All right, we're going to push Matt Bracken back because we're going to have a moment

1493
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,260
of clarity here.

1494
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:29,940
Rob came in about two hours ago and he said, we've got this video and I said, that's wonderful.

1495
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:30,940
Just tell them about it.

1496
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:31,940
We'll have it.

1497
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:32,940
No problem.

1498
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:33,940
Take care of it.

1499
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:39,500
And, uh, we had a little meetings about it and now we don't have it and I'm not mad.

1500
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,500
I love it.

1501
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,500
I love it.

1502
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,500
It's okay.

1503
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:49,900
So it's all of us phones and computers have obituated us not to get face to face and have

1504
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:50,900
a meeting.

1505
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:51,940
So my crew works their ass off.

1506
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:57,400
They're amazing, but they produce so much information that if they don't face to face

1507
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,700
and have that decision, it never happens.

1508
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:00,700
So that's okay.

1509
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,020
Cause it's not bad to have a mistake on a live show.

1510
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:04,900
We're going to air that on air.

1511
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:05,900
It's going to happen.

1512
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,740
If I have to host the next five hours, it's going to happen.

1513
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:10,320
So that's what all this is about.

1514
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,200
That's what all this is about.

1515
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,340
You understand?

1516
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,340
That's what all this is about.

1517
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,300
Did he just tell me that his employees don't read emails?

1518
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:22,300
Um, maybe they got to do this face to face face to face.

1519
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:25,940
They ignore me if I'm not yelling at them.

1520
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,740
I can't get tone and email.

1521
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:29,740
I try all caps.

1522
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:30,740
It doesn't work.

1523
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:31,740
It doesn't do anything for me.

1524
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:32,740
Yeah.

1525
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:38,040
I mean, I just thought I'd put that in there cause I mean, that is what this is all about.

1526
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,300
People thought, I know that I've heard this feedback from the audience a lot.

1527
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,300
Sure, sure, sure.

1528
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:48,420
If Biden wins, Alex's tech problems will go away because he'll recognize that he's got

1529
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:54,340
to get his shit together and they'll really clean up a shop and take care of business.

1530
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:55,340
No.

1531
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:57,700
Another storyline to follow in, uh, Alex and Tibet.

1532
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,180
I'm going to call it that this season.

1533
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:01,180
That's what we're going to do.

1534
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,180
Um, sure.

1535
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,420
I'm down with that.

1536
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:07,900
So in this next clip, this is the last one from Alex's show on November 5th and that

1537
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,380
is him handing it off to Matt Bracken.

1538
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:18,180
Uh, noted weirdo, uh, Matt Bracken, fourth hour host and nothing else, Matt Bracken.

1539
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:23,540
Um, Alex needs to go somewhere and he needs to get some guidance about where to go.

1540
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:26,500
So you ask Matt Bracken, where am I going?

1541
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:33,220
I'm planning to get on an airplane and either go to, uh, either go to, uh, Arizona or go

1542
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,220
to Georgia.

1543
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:36,220
Let me ask Matt Bracken this question.

1544
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,220
I'm gonna play this clip.

1545
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:40,020
Matt, where do you think people need to be the most on the ground?

1546
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,700
Is it, is it Detroit?

1547
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,980
Is it, uh, is it Arizona?

1548
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:44,980
Is it Georgia?

1549
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:45,980
They're trying to steal them all right now.

1550
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:48,740
They already got Detroit.

1551
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:49,940
It's a multi-front war.

1552
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:54,900
I would probably say Philadelphia because if, if, uh, if it's, if it doesn't happen

1553
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,920
in Pennsylvania, it doesn't matter.

1554
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:02,140
The other ones are peripheral, you know, the path, all of the pathways for Trump require

1555
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:03,500
our Pennsylvania.

1556
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,500
Good point, Matt.

1557
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:08,500
I'm going to Arizona, Arizona.

1558
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:13,300
Why do you even ask people stuff?

1559
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,860
All right, Matt, that's a, that's a very good point.

1560
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:17,980
That is a good point.

1561
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:21,460
I have friends in Arizona and Philly will beat the shit out of me.

1562
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:22,460
I will get my ass kicked.

1563
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:23,460
I'm going to go to Arizona.

1564
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:25,460
I'm not going to be in Philly.

1565
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:26,460
Not going to be in Philly.

1566
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:27,460
Did you see that?

1567
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:29,580
There were people dancing and they want to hurt me.

1568
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:30,580
Yeah.

1569
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:32,540
Uh, Gritty is going to kick my ass.

1570
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:34,260
Gritty will kick your ass.

1571
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:39,860
Uh, so Alex goes to take a nap, I guess, and then the spirits come to him and tell him

1572
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:40,860
to go to Arizona.

1573
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:41,860
Okay.

1574
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:42,860
I don't fucking know.

1575
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:43,860
Something like that.

1576
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:49,620
Uh, but while he's taking a nap, Owen Troyer comes in to host the war room and, uh, Owen

1577
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:52,060
has a big guest, uh, on the show.

1578
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:53,060
Oh no.

1579
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:55,500
I get the sense that by this point, Alex has left.

1580
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,460
I think he's already on route to Arizona.

1581
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:58,460
Yeah.

1582
01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:59,460
Okay.

1583
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:03,620
Uh, because there is a sense of like, we should get Alex in on this and he's unavailable.

1584
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:04,620
Uh oh.

1585
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:09,660
Uh, so he's either taking that nap or he's on his way to Arizona, but big guest.

1586
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:12,780
But Dr. Steve Pacinek, uh, as we're in the middle of this, the election's over.

1587
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:15,060
We're now in the stealing process of the election.

1588
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:16,800
Uh, what are you seeing?

1589
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:22,060
What's going through your mind as you're witnessing this gigantic hoax?

1590
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:24,180
Number one, it's not a hoax.

1591
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:30,460
What's happening now and the reason I couldn't come on the Alex Jones show last night was

1592
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:35,140
I was not given the permission that I needed to in order to say what I'm about to say now.

1593
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,180
I do not work for the federal government.

1594
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:38,180
I'm not paid by them.

1595
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:42,300
Make it clear I don't work for the government.

1596
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,300
We know.

1597
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,300
We know, Steve.

1598
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:49,420
So yeah, it's at first it sounded like he was talking from inside a bottle.

1599
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:50,420
Sure.

1600
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:51,420
Sure.

1601
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,420
But, uh, I guess it turned the game up on us.

1602
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:54,940
Turn that up just a little bit so we can hear the doctor.

1603
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:55,940
Yeah.

1604
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,860
He didn't have permission to say something.

1605
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:04,580
I didn't get the go ahead from Melania and now we will be taking over everything.

1606
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:08,900
I am consort to Melania, queen of the earth.

1607
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:09,940
Can I be honest with you?

1608
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:10,940
What's that?

1609
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,820
I think that he knew that this shit wouldn't fly with Alex.

1610
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:14,180
Yeah, I absolutely think that.

1611
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:16,660
I think that that's what permission means.

1612
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:17,780
That's exactly what I thought.

1613
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:21,060
Yeah, because here's what he's got here because I couldn't say this on Alex's show.

1614
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,060
He wouldn't let me.

1615
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:24,940
Here's what Steve recently got permission to say.

1616
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:25,940
Gotcha.

1617
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:32,340
This is really a sting operation, contrary to what everybody else said, Trump knew this

1618
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:33,340
was happening.

1619
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:37,180
Eric knew this was happening and warn the public.

1620
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:41,100
I knew this was happening, however, I could not say anything about it.

1621
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:42,100
Of course not.

1622
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:49,820
What happened was we marked watermark every ballot with what's called the Q F S block

1623
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:51,540
chain encryption code.

1624
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:57,420
In other words, we know pretty well where every ballot is, where it went and who has

1625
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,420
it.

1626
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,540
So this is not a stolen election.

1627
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:07,540
On the contrary, we reversed the entire game of war along the lines of the sons of the

1628
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:08,980
art of war.

1629
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:11,940
And Trump was brilliant and still is brilliant at it.

1630
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:17,500
So what we've got here is Steve claiming that the election was actually a sting operation

1631
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:23,380
to catch voter fraud, wherein the department of Homeland security has watermarked all of

1632
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,940
these ballots with block chain.

1633
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:26,900
He does not explain what he means by that.

1634
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,100
Oh, don't worry about it.

1635
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,940
And they can be traced.

1636
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:33,820
They know literally where every single ballot is at any point.

1637
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:36,860
And because of this watermark, they can tell which ones are fake.

1638
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:38,260
So there's a bunch of ballots.

1639
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:41,140
They know, Oh, no watermark, these are fake.

1640
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,300
This is a load of horse shit.

1641
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,300
Yeah, this is not good.

1642
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,300
This is real bad.

1643
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,300
This is real bad.

1644
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:53,860
One of the reasons why this is really particularly bad is this is a narrative that is so provable.

1645
01:11:53,860 --> 01:12:01,380
This is one that like, if you have this information, if Trump really does have this, first of all,

1646
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:02,820
he needs to bring it out.

1647
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:03,820
That's the only thing he needs to do.

1648
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:09,400
I still don't want him to be president, but he has a moral obligation to tell the nation.

1649
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:13,540
This is exactly what you would do like the day after they called everybody would be like,

1650
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:17,100
okay, now we're going to reveal that this was all a sting operation.

1651
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,100
Yeah.

1652
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,460
Now it turns out this backfires because no one cares and they all think I already lost

1653
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:22,460
the election.

1654
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:23,460
It's...

1655
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,460
Oh, that's not good.

1656
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:25,860
But you'd have this hard evidence.

1657
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:26,860
That's true.

1658
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:27,860
That's true.

1659
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:28,860
This is hard evidence.

1660
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:29,860
I'm sure it is.

1661
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:32,380
You have to keep these conspiracies non-falsifiable.

1662
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:39,500
They have to be like vague and about coups and counter coups and moves and shadowy things.

1663
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,820
This is too concrete.

1664
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:43,100
It's absolute.

1665
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,140
I have a, I have another problem with this.

1666
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:46,140
Oh, just one?

1667
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,140
Just one.

1668
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:48,140
All right.

1669
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:52,180
So he is saying we, I assume he can't mean he, he's not including himself.

1670
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:53,380
He always talks like that.

1671
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:56,940
He says that I have, I have 17,000 troops in Germany.

1672
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,660
I was going to say, he always does that.

1673
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:00,500
He speaks in the first person about everything.

1674
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:05,580
It's just like we have watermarked these ballots, but then he started with, I don't work for

1675
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:06,580
the federal government.

1676
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:07,580
He's a ramp...

1677
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:10,200
What the fuck do you work for that's watermarking all these ballots?

1678
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,700
He's a rampant narcissist.

1679
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:12,700
Totally.

1680
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:13,700
Yeah.

1681
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:14,700
This is a QAnon thing too.

1682
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:15,700
This was going around in QAnon.

1683
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:16,700
Yeah, no, I've heard this one.

1684
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:17,700
Yeah.

1685
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:20,380
And also I was thinking about it as like, why is Steve into this?

1686
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:22,660
One, I think it's cause he's into QAnon.

1687
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:23,660
Sure.

1688
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:28,060
Two, I was researching like watermarked ballots and one of the places that it comes up the

1689
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:34,500
most as like a very like con, like a normally used thing is in condo association elections

1690
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,380
in Florida.

1691
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:42,060
Now Steve lives in Florida.

1692
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:45,620
So it's gated communities.

1693
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:48,180
That's where all watermarked ballots...

1694
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:52,420
It's an issue that's discussed on a number of websites about condo association elections

1695
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:55,360
and like ways to keep them secure.

1696
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,980
And so like, I think that maybe he has some experience with the idea from that.

1697
01:13:58,980 --> 01:13:59,980
That's very funny.

1698
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:02,700
And maybe he's projecting that onto the world.

1699
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,420
Anyway, this is silly.

1700
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:05,420
Yeah.

1701
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:06,420
It's not good.

1702
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,900
And it gets worse.

1703
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,620
All of this was expected.

1704
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:14,140
All of this is part of the sting operation we're running.

1705
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:20,160
And let me tell you that 48 hours ago, not only did we put markers on those ballots,

1706
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:26,460
but I can say now with the permission of people in the intelligence community and elsewhere

1707
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:33,140
that we have sent out thousands and thousands of national guards to 12 different States,

1708
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:38,140
Washington, Delaware, Texas, Arizona, Alabama, and everywhere.

1709
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:43,180
So now you have to consider and rethink what this is really about.

1710
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:45,460
This is about the constitution, clearly.

1711
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:46,460
Wait.

1712
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:51,460
So the governors of those States, I assume, approved the national guard.

1713
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,860
Invited in the national guard.

1714
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:55,100
Because that's how it has to work.

1715
01:14:55,100 --> 01:15:01,660
And all these States who run their own elections have agreed to his watermarking of the ballot.

1716
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:02,660
Of course.

1717
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:03,660
Yeah.

1718
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:04,660
Okay.

1719
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:05,660
Whatever.

1720
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:06,660
This is deeply unconstitutional.

1721
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:07,660
Get the fuck out of here.

1722
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,660
Get the fuck out of here.

1723
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:09,660
Get the fuck out of here.

1724
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:10,660
Yeah.

1725
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,660
Anyway, so that's kind of like how you would respond if you were Owen, hearing this.

1726
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:13,660
Sure, sure, sure.

1727
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:14,660
Fuck off, Owen.

1728
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:15,660
Get the fuck out of here.

1729
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:16,660
Fuck off.

1730
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:17,660
What are you doing?

1731
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:18,660
Come on.

1732
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:19,660
This is terrible.

1733
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:20,660
He's wearing a Hawaiian shirt, too.

1734
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:21,660
Yeah.

1735
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:22,660
He was not.

1736
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:23,660
Yes.

1737
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:24,660
You can't be running the revolution in a goddamn Hawaiian shirt.

1738
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:25,660
He's sitting there.

1739
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:28,020
He's like, ah, I might as well have like a drink and a coconut in my hand.

1740
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:29,020
Yeah, why not?

1741
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:30,020
Yeah, yeah.

1742
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:31,020
Here's how Owen responds.

1743
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,020
Okay.

1744
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:36,580
Steve, you've just broken certainly perhaps the biggest news since the election here on

1745
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:37,580
the show.

1746
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:40,220
I have to play this out logically in my head.

1747
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:41,220
Okay.

1748
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:44,460
That's why I go on your show to basically, I keep saying-

1749
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:45,460
Well, I love you, Steve.

1750
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:48,100
I'd kiss you on the lips right now if it wasn't digitally.

1751
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:49,100
Aha.

1752
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:50,100
So he's thrilled.

1753
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:51,100
Of course he is.

1754
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:52,420
Now, Steve wants to make this even better.

1755
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,420
Yeah, of course.

1756
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:54,540
Because there's even better news.

1757
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,660
Come on.

1758
01:15:55,660 --> 01:16:01,900
People will be arrested as of tonight, tomorrow, and it will go on for quite a while.

1759
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:05,620
And this was a total sting operation that I can say.

1760
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:06,620
Okay.

1761
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:07,700
Well, this did not happen.

1762
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:13,140
The Red Wedding will play itself out every night for years to come.

1763
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:15,660
There will be blood in the streets.

1764
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:19,380
Until only Melania is left.

1765
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:22,940
Melania will stand to take the Game of Thrones.

1766
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:23,940
Yeah.

1767
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:25,940
All right.

1768
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:26,940
Okay.

1769
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:33,120
This is getting a little more Q than Steve usually is.

1770
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:40,780
Like he's usually either cranky, racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic.

1771
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:44,340
He usually has something going on, or wants to insult Alex a bunch.

1772
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:45,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1773
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,340
Those are the best.

1774
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:47,340
He does seem to have themed appearances.

1775
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:48,340
Yeah.

1776
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:49,340
This is quite Q.

1777
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,340
Yeah.

1778
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:55,460
And it's strange, but I also think that he knows on some level, whether it's rationally

1779
01:16:55,460 --> 01:17:00,200
and consciously or just sort of, ah, best not to try, he knows that Alex wouldn't put

1780
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,200
up with this, probably.

1781
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,200
No, no, no, no.

1782
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,260
We're trying to say that this election was stolen.

1783
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:06,260
Yeah.

1784
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:07,260
That's the business.

1785
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:08,560
That's where the money is.

1786
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:14,660
You saying this is something that's going to be completely disproven, or it'll be like

1787
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:16,900
never proven, like why wasn't it?

1788
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,900
Exactly.

1789
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,420
This is going to be a big problem for us.

1790
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:21,460
We can't make money off this.

1791
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:24,140
You're trying to build a pay-per-view match that no one wants to see.

1792
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,340
This is a day-long story.

1793
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:27,340
At best.

1794
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:29,700
This is a day-long story at best, and that's only on the War Room.

1795
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:32,300
This is a distraction for the junior varsity.

1796
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,300
Oh, man.

1797
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,300
Yeah.

1798
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,300
Yeah.

1799
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,300
Give this to Owen while I'm out.

1800
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,300
Yeah.

1801
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:38,300
So Steve talks a little bit more about this.

1802
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:44,340
I still don't really understand what he's describing.

1803
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:48,500
I would love for him to actually say what all this technology is, but he doesn't do

1804
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,500
that.

1805
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:50,500
All right.

1806
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:56,100
So how is this watermark on the ballots, what is the significance of that as to, is it going

1807
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:59,940
to stop from fake balance being counted, or how is that going to be used?

1808
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:04,480
Well, we use it in any way that we need to use it in terms of counting, knowing which

1809
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,500
ones were fake, which ones were not.

1810
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,740
It's a very sophisticated code.

1811
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:15,100
So if you just throw them away, these are cyber communication implementations that we

1812
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:18,220
have the code for, and we know exactly what was thrown away.

1813
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:20,180
We know exactly what was placed.

1814
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:23,860
We know exactly who has it, and we know exactly where it went.

1815
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:26,900
I can't go any further than that.

1816
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:27,900
Wow.

1817
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:32,860
This is a huge news that Steve Pechenik is breaking on our show right now.

1818
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:34,540
Some would call it news.

1819
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:35,540
Some would not.

1820
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:40,540
I mean, yeah, I'm going to go with, I don't think I'm going to buy that one, Dan.

1821
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:45,140
If I were Owen, I'd be like, wow, Steve's having fun today.

1822
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:46,140
He's on one.

1823
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:47,140
Yeah.

1824
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,140
Yeah.

1825
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,140
Steve's dressed for the occasion.

1826
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:53,220
He showed up in his uniform for what this is, which is bullshit.

1827
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:54,220
Hold the fucking phone.

1828
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:55,220
Yeah.

1829
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:58,340
If you know where every ballot is right now.

1830
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:01,140
Like God's Eye from the Fast and Furious movie.

1831
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:05,000
Like why are we bothering with all this nonsense?

1832
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,100
And if they're fake, why didn't you tell people at the ballot counting places that they were

1833
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,100
fake?

1834
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,340
Everywhere had people watching them.

1835
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:15,060
But you're not a showman.

1836
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:17,380
You don't understand the need for the reveal.

1837
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:18,380
You're right.

1838
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:19,380
You're right.

1839
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:20,380
This was all my fault.

1840
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,380
Yes.

1841
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:22,380
I didn't realize that we have to have the prestige.

1842
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,380
I apologize.

1843
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:25,180
Why do the trick if there isn't the reveal?

1844
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:26,180
I apologize.

1845
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:27,180
I get you.

1846
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:28,180
You've got to do this.

1847
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,180
No, no.

1848
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:30,180
You're right.

1849
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:31,420
That part makes total sense.

1850
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:36,220
If in Ocean's Eleven they just stole money and then left, that's a very bad movie.

1851
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:37,220
I get it.

1852
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:38,220
Yeah.

1853
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:41,780
He needs to explain a little bit more about what this tech he's describing is, why it's

1854
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:42,780
so powerful.

1855
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:43,780
Sure.

1856
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:48,260
And then also, it's a big problem when nothing comes of this.

1857
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:49,260
Yeah.

1858
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,260
That's a real problem.

1859
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:53,540
Because if you take Alex's instincts, even if he's desperate to come up with a way to

1860
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:58,640
spin the election, he would know better than to take this on as something that he's going

1861
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:03,060
to have to then deal with tomorrow and the day after and the day after.

1862
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:06,260
It's much easier to say that there was someone who might have been Chinese who showed up

1863
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,220
at four in the morning with a box of ballots.

1864
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,220
Done.

1865
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:10,220
Try and disprove me.

1866
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:12,680
You don't even care enough to disprove me.

1867
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:17,060
But if you start saying some shit like, I know where every ballot is, now we're in trouble,

1868
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,060
man.

1869
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:19,060
Yeah, yeah.

1870
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:20,060
Now I got to deal with shit.

1871
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:21,060
Absolutely.

1872
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:24,460
Like somebody saying stuff like, why didn't you just use a barcode?

1873
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:27,620
So Owen gets a little bit high on this.

1874
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:28,620
Of course.

1875
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:31,220
On Steve's inside exclusive.

1876
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:32,220
He's young.

1877
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:33,220
Yeah.

1878
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:35,820
And he perhaps just broke the biggest news story of the day.

1879
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:40,220
He did it in a floral button up shirt with a smile on his face from his kitchen.

1880
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:45,520
So Fox News and mainstream news and all you with your billions of dollars and your big

1881
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:51,700
pharmaceutical contracts, I'll keep it PG rated, you can go fudge yourselves, okay?

1882
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:55,180
Go fudge yourselves and enjoy it as well.

1883
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:57,980
Now I want to hone in on what Dr. Pacinik broke.

1884
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:01,780
Again, folks, Steve can reiterate this in his own words.

1885
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:09,500
The whole election theft was a setup.

1886
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:10,900
Try and say it.

1887
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,140
Try and say it.

1888
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:14,740
That's my favorite thing.

1889
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:19,020
That is just the best.

1890
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:25,940
That is my, like what I like to laugh at is Owen taunting the mainstream fake news.

1891
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:26,940
Defiant.

1892
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:34,460
Defiant in the face of all reality, listening to Dr. Steve Pacinik while he's masturbating

1893
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:36,300
looking to photos of Melania.

1894
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,740
Oh my God.

1895
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:42,500
Now Steve, he's a weirdo.

1896
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:43,500
Yeah.

1897
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,500
Yeah.

1898
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,500
I agree.

1899
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,500
I agree.

1900
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:50,420
Even when he comes in with this kind of thing, he's still going to say some things during

1901
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:53,460
the interview that are big problems for InfoWars.

1902
01:21:53,460 --> 01:22:00,540
And one of them comes in this next clip because Alex has been very, very clear that the Democrats

1903
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,180
are run by the Chinese.

1904
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:03,180
And the devil.

1905
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:04,180
Well, through China.

1906
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:05,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1907
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:07,780
China is like the intermediary between the devil and the Democrats, basically.

1908
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:10,020
That's a tough job.

1909
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:12,100
Steve says, nah.

1910
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:14,180
Who is running this Democrat party right now?

1911
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:15,260
I mean, who is running?

1912
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:16,260
Who is the brain trust?

1913
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:17,680
It's obviously not Biden.

1914
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:18,780
I don't think it's Obama.

1915
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:19,780
Is it the Chinese?

1916
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:21,660
Are the Chinese setting them up?

1917
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:27,220
No, the Chinese are not part of it with all due respect to Chinese communism and all that.

1918
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:29,220
I know Chinese communism quite well.

1919
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:30,220
I know Xi.

1920
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:32,220
I've known about Mao Zedong.

1921
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:37,540
The real issue is the inherent corruption of a democratic party and its machinery.

1922
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:38,540
Wait, wait, wait.

1923
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:39,540
So the Chinese aren't involved at all?

1924
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:41,420
So the Chinese aren't involved at all.

1925
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:42,420
Wait, wait, Steve.

1926
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,420
I'm very familiar with Chinese communism.

1927
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:45,660
Xi and I hang out.

1928
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:47,620
We play golf on the weekends.

1929
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:49,820
He's part of my condo association.

1930
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:53,660
Before I leave, I'd like to contradict Alex's entire world here.

1931
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:54,660
Perfect.

1932
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:55,660
Wow.

1933
01:22:55,660 --> 01:23:03,500
And while I'm here, there's no such thing as God.

1934
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,900
The Chinese communists are not important.

1935
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:07,340
They're not a big deal.

1936
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:09,860
The election was a sting operation.

1937
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,500
I gotta go.

1938
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,380
You know who you gotta worry about?

1939
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,380
Uruguay.

1940
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:17,220
They're big in the stealing elections game.

1941
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:19,140
This dude is throwing haymakers.

1942
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:20,140
Wow.

1943
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:21,140
Yeah.

1944
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:22,140
Love it.

1945
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:23,140
So they get talking a little bit about Obama.

1946
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:24,940
This is kind of funny.

1947
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:31,180
When I heard Obama two days ago again say, in this democracy, we have the right to vote.

1948
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,180
You moron Obama.

1949
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:37,420
I mean, this is a CIA operative that I kept saying should have gone to prison.

1950
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:38,420
Everything in battle.

1951
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:39,420
Does Trump know that?

1952
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:40,420
Does Trump know who Obama is?

1953
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:42,460
He knew already.

1954
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:43,460
He knew.

1955
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:46,780
But does he have the intelligence files too?

1956
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:48,260
I can't say that.

1957
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:49,260
Okay.

1958
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:50,660
Oh man.

1959
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:51,660
So funny.

1960
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:52,660
Yeah.

1961
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,660
He knows it.

1962
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:54,660
Does he have a file?

1963
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:55,660
I don't know.

1964
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:59,420
All of this seems so much more fun and less serious when I don't have like four years

1965
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:01,340
of murder to look forward to.

1966
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:02,340
You know?

1967
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:03,340
Yeah.

1968
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:05,020
I mean, there's four years of, you know, still trouble.

1969
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:08,480
Oh, gonna be a lot of trouble, but not like every...

1970
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:14,740
It's more a situation of, I think we're still in a little bit of like exhaling.

1971
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:17,020
There is a big exhale going on.

1972
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,780
And I think that you might be overselling like the...

1973
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:20,780
I'm trying.

1974
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:21,780
The feelings of relief and stuff.

1975
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:22,780
I'm trying to do more things in America.

1976
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:23,780
I'm trying, man.

1977
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:27,700
And I think it's a really tough thing because, you know, like on the one hand, yes, don't

1978
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:33,460
discount the fact that getting Trump out of office and him losing is very crucially important.

1979
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:39,300
While, at the same time, don't lose sight of the fact that even though Biden gets in,

1980
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:42,720
it doesn't mean anything is fixed by itself.

1981
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,820
There's still exactly the same amount of work that needs to be done.

1982
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:47,340
The same issues exist.

1983
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:52,160
I tweeted out just like, oh, fuck, Biden is president.

1984
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:55,300
And then, oh, fuck, Biden is president.

1985
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,980
And people were like, don't ruin this for me.

1986
01:24:56,980 --> 01:25:00,420
I'm like, no, no, no, you can hold these two thoughts simultaneously.

1987
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:02,100
These are not dissonant thoughts.

1988
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,660
These are nuanced thoughts.

1989
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:04,660
Yeah, yeah.

1990
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:07,780
It could be, it could be, I mean, there's challenges.

1991
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:08,780
Yeah.

1992
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:09,780
And we just have to figure out.

1993
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,140
Shit's still got to get done.

1994
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:12,140
Yeah.

1995
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:18,420
So Steve, we know from his time with Alex over the years, his normal methodology with

1996
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:20,300
Alex is to flatter him.

1997
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,300
Yes.

1998
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:24,700
And we see this exact same behavior being applied to Owen here.

1999
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:25,700
Please.

2000
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:29,620
You know, self-deprecation is not impressive to me, Owen.

2001
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:30,620
You're there.

2002
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:36,020
You have to talk a lot and it takes a lot of cajonas and it takes a lot of sense of

2003
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:40,540
self-worth and a sense of humor, which you and Alex have.

2004
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:43,800
And you got a great staff with Daria and Scott and all of them.

2005
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,580
But the point was you were selected.

2006
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:53,500
I did not only selected you guys, but I personally selected you and those who I work with or

2007
01:25:53,500 --> 01:26:00,040
deal with, friendly with, they understood that it would come for your show.

2008
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:02,740
That to me sounds like Alex wouldn't buy this shit.

2009
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:04,580
I was like, who could I go on?

2010
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:05,580
Uh, Owen.

2011
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:06,740
Owen will buy it.

2012
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:09,220
I think we're getting real delusional here.

2013
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:14,380
This has gone past like fun conspiracy theories to him being like, I control the universe.

2014
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:20,300
Well, and like I have this big breaking news and you know, you're so wonderful Owen that

2015
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,700
I chose you to break the story.

2016
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:29,220
That isn't like, I mean, it's nonsensical, but it's really him saying, I had nowhere

2017
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,220
else to go.

2018
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:31,220
No, it is.

2019
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:32,220
Absolutely.

2020
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,220
You were as good as I could do.

2021
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:36,140
So I'm going to butter you up really hard.

2022
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:42,300
So Owen's like, yeah, Alex, we need to get Alex in on this because this is big, like

2023
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,300
for them.

2024
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:45,340
Oh, and you are so, so young.

2025
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:49,300
Steve, if you could hold over Alex Jones, as soon as he heard Steve Pechenik break the

2026
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:53,180
huge news about the Trump sting, Alex Jones hopped in his race car.

2027
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:56,460
He's probably going about 160 miles per hour right now.

2028
01:26:56,460 --> 01:27:00,420
He's probably on the phone with engineers trying to rig up like a car helicopter so

2029
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:02,980
we can get here faster and avoid traffic.

2030
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:04,740
Alex does not show up.

2031
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:09,660
And Owen ends up interviewing Jesse Lee Peterson after Steve.

2032
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:10,660
So I don't know.

2033
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:15,100
I don't, I think I feel like Alex would be like, shut it down.

2034
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:16,100
Yeah.

2035
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:17,100
Shut it down.

2036
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,100
Yeah, totally.

2037
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:24,380
But Owen, Owen has that feel of like a literal apprentice situation where it's like the,

2038
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:28,460
the master is out of the room and I found something that I think is really exciting

2039
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:31,100
and it's like, this one and this one's mine.

2040
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:34,300
I discovered this one, this one, I'm going to take it to the master and he's going to

2041
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:35,300
be so proud of me.

2042
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:37,380
And then they, he's like, no, this is fucking stupid.

2043
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:40,940
Isn't that that Disney movie?

2044
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:41,940
The Sorcerer's Apprentice?

2045
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:42,940
Yeah.

2046
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:43,940
Isn't that basically the plot of Fantasia?

2047
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:44,940
Yeah.

2048
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:45,940
Might be the plot of Fantasia.

2049
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:46,940
Yeah.

2050
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:47,940
You might be correct.

2051
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:50,740
Owen's accidentally made the mops dance around and they're all making a mess.

2052
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,740
Yeah, that's about it.

2053
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:53,740
Yeah.

2054
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:55,340
That is exactly right.

2055
01:27:55,340 --> 01:28:00,140
But it's still like, this is what I want plugged into my fucking veins.

2056
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,140
Of course.

2057
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:11,340
Ladies and gentlemen, we're back in the Infowars war room devastating the fake news media today

2058
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:16,860
with Dr. Steve Pacinek giving us the inside scoop of president Trump's sting operation

2059
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:18,380
that is ongoing right now.

2060
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:20,040
The traps have been sprung.

2061
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,840
Traps are sprung.

2062
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,420
Defending the fake news.

2063
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:27,980
There's a, there's a, there are two different completely feelings.

2064
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:30,300
Two different feelings, right?

2065
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:35,260
There's the feeling of being proud of yourself and then having that pride punctured by someone

2066
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:37,740
else and realizing I have failed.

2067
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:42,400
And then there's the feeling of hoping someone else will be proud of you.

2068
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:45,140
And when that gets punctured, that's devastating.

2069
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:47,420
I'm looking forward to hearing that from Owen.

2070
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:49,420
I want to hear that devastation.

2071
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:51,660
He thinks somebody's going to be so proud of him.

2072
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:52,660
Yeah.

2073
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:53,660
Yeah.

2074
01:28:53,660 --> 01:29:01,540
Or he'll, I don't, God, it's just, there, it's a complex feeling that is like, I've

2075
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:02,540
done it.

2076
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:03,540
Yep.

2077
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:07,460
I have figured out how to save the world or something or totally, or even just like reduce

2078
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:08,460
it down.

2079
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:11,740
And on a cynical level, we're going to make a lot of money off this or something, you

2080
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:16,140
know, like there's just, I've saved Infowars and you can see it in the moment.

2081
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:19,220
Like no, exactly right.

2082
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:21,220
But because I hate them, it's hilarious.

2083
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:22,220
I love it.

2084
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:23,220
Yeah.

2085
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:24,220
This is, screw it.

2086
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:26,220
I would never laugh at conservative tears.

2087
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:28,980
Conservative hubris is the funniest thing in the world.

2088
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:29,980
Exactly.

2089
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:33,820
And that's really what I was feeling when it was like, what's the reverse that I can

2090
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:39,860
feel good about of election night 2016, Alex laughing at people crying.

2091
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:40,860
It's this.

2092
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:41,860
It is this.

2093
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:44,180
Owen being like, we're taking down the fake news.

2094
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:48,020
Pure, pure, pure joy I get from this.

2095
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:53,300
Owen either being unable or incapable of seeing through Steve Pechenik's bullshit.

2096
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:56,780
So transparently stupid bullshit.

2097
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:59,900
And being like, we got him, we got him.

2098
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:00,900
Fuck you, CNN.

2099
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:01,900
Oh, sorry.

2100
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:05,540
Fudge you, CNN.

2101
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:07,420
We're past the emperor has no clothes.

2102
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:11,620
The emperor is walking down the street without skin and everybody's pointing and Owen is

2103
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:14,500
like, that's the emperor, baby!

2104
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,900
Love that guy!

2105
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:20,660
So we have one last clip here of Steve, uh, talking to Owen and again, it's just the buttering

2106
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:21,660
up.

2107
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:22,660
Yeah.

2108
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:26,620
I was given the privilege of announcing this, but I don't know who else knows it.

2109
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:29,280
I don't know what else will happen.

2110
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:35,420
The truth of the matter is that your show was chosen and you have the good or the benefit

2111
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:40,580
and I hope this will result in a lot of arrests and the end of a problem.

2112
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:41,580
Okay.

2113
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:42,580
Yeah.

2114
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:43,580
Yeah.

2115
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:44,580
I wish you Godspeed.

2116
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:45,580
Yeah.

2117
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:53,220
So I hope this winds up with a lot of arrests.

2118
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:57,580
Like I said, uh, uh, Owen goes on to interview Jesse Lee Peterson.

2119
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:58,580
Yes.

2120
01:30:58,580 --> 01:30:59,580
Then everyone went to sleep.

2121
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:00,580
Right.

2122
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:08,420
And the next day we wake up and David Knight's show, uh, from November 6th, he realizes Owen

2123
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:11,140
got these brooms and mops dancing all over the place.

2124
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:12,380
I got to clean up.

2125
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:18,820
No, I know there's a theory that's come out saying we have watermarked ballots and this

2126
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:25,140
is all just a big sting and we should trust the plan and I'm telling you right now, I'll

2127
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:32,980
give you details on why I think that is absolute total gaslighting from a CIA official still

2128
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:34,900
working for them.

2129
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:37,300
And uh, we'll, we'll talk about that coming up.

2130
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:40,160
That is absolute nonsense in my opinion.

2131
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,660
So it's pajama kicked off the show forever.

2132
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:49,180
So David Knight comes in and he's like, fuck you.

2133
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:53,180
When I first heard that this had gone down, the David Knight was pushing back on this

2134
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:54,180
stuff.

2135
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:55,180
I'm like, he is fired.

2136
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:56,180
Yeah.

2137
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:57,180
He is fucking fired.

2138
01:31:57,180 --> 01:32:00,660
Then when I sat and thought about it a little bit more and recognize like, what are the

2139
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:02,260
dynamics here?

2140
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,940
I think David Knight's fine.

2141
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:04,940
Yeah.

2142
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:05,940
And I think they'll just pretend.

2143
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:06,940
Oh, and didn't do that.

2144
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:07,940
Yeah.

2145
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:12,220
They made a bad move, but it's like, that's an info wars mistake.

2146
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:13,940
It's an, it's the apprentice mistake.

2147
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:14,940
Yes.

2148
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:16,180
You know, of course you forgive the apprentice.

2149
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:17,180
That's how you learn.

2150
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:18,980
It's an info wars mistake too.

2151
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:20,220
It's in the world of info wars.

2152
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:24,740
You were chasing down a conspiracy, you know, like nine times out of 10, maybe it doesn't

2153
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:25,740
work.

2154
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,220
That 10th time, maybe we make a million dollars.

2155
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:28,220
Exactly.

2156
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:29,220
So fine.

2157
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:30,220
We'll let you do that.

2158
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:31,660
It's embarrassing.

2159
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:33,200
Pretend you didn't do it.

2160
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,300
Move along.

2161
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:35,300
Put Steve in timeout.

2162
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,300
Right.

2163
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:39,900
He's going to be gone for a little bit.

2164
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:42,180
He's not coming back before the inauguration.

2165
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:45,860
When I listened to this David Knight thing, first of all, I was like, wow, he is as boring

2166
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:46,900
as I remember.

2167
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:49,180
But then I was like, Oh yeah, no, no.

2168
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:51,340
He's doing what daddy needs him to do.

2169
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:55,500
He's doing the work of cleaning up this because the narrative needs to be that the fucking

2170
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,920
election was stolen.

2171
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:00,760
You can't have it be that Trump did a sting operation.

2172
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,200
That's going to fall apart.

2173
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,200
Real quick.

2174
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,200
Oh boy.

2175
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,200
Yeah.

2176
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,200
David Knight had good instincts.

2177
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,200
That's weird.

2178
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:10,060
Uh, but it looked like it was like, you're fucking gone.

2179
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:12,100
Steve, Steve has got to be on the outs.

2180
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:14,340
He's got to have like at least had a talking to or something.

2181
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:15,340
This one's too nuts.

2182
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:16,340
Yeah.

2183
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:17,340
Yeah.

2184
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:20,740
That must've been a phone call of like, dude, dude, you can't be swinging that hard.

2185
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:21,740
Yeah.

2186
01:33:21,740 --> 01:33:25,860
So David Knight, uh, before he gets down to business on, on Steve's nonsense, he, uh,

2187
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:29,300
I just wanted to play a couple of clips of his show just to be like, the tones of these

2188
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:31,740
things are so fucking different.

2189
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:39,260
Twitter permanently banned Steve Bannon because he called for, that's the way the daily mark

2190
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:40,620
of the beast puts it.

2191
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:46,700
Uh, he called for the beheading of dr Fauci and FBI director Christopher Ray.

2192
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:51,900
Well, here's what he actually had to say.

2193
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:53,940
I'd actually like to go back to the old times of tutor England.

2194
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:56,220
I'd put that their heads on pikes, right?

2195
01:33:56,220 --> 01:34:00,260
I put them on two corners of the white house as a warning to federal bureaucrats.

2196
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:03,900
Now, this is what's known as a metaphor, I believe.

2197
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:08,380
I always get that confused assemblies, but I believe it's a metaphor because he didn't

2198
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:13,100
use the word like, I think that is the, wow.

2199
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:14,460
What is this show?

2200
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:15,460
Exactly.

2201
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:18,940
I'm like, this is for grandparents or something sarcastic old man show.

2202
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:19,940
Yeah.

2203
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:23,060
Like this is, this is for people who need a little bit of a milder presentation to their

2204
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:28,700
extreme and their rationalizations of, of people saying fucked up things.

2205
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:31,780
Oh, these people, they're not going to cut off heads.

2206
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:33,820
It's a metaphor.

2207
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:38,940
Also, I will say that David Knight likes to make jokes.

2208
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:48,020
All right, Nancy Pelosi has announced a big expansion of COVID testing for lawmakers.

2209
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:50,660
Well, I saw this and saw testing, testing.

2210
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:53,940
Well, I knew it wasn't going to be polygraph testing.

2211
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:57,140
Now that would be funny.

2212
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:58,660
Wow.

2213
01:34:58,660 --> 01:35:00,540
That was actually almost charming.

2214
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:02,300
I was almost a little charmed by that.

2215
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:03,900
Yeah, because you know what that was?

2216
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:04,900
That was...

2217
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:06,740
Grandpa laughed at his own joke.

2218
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:07,740
And it had joke structure.

2219
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:08,740
Yeah, it did.

2220
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:09,740
It had structure.

2221
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:10,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2222
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:11,740
It wasn't funny.

2223
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:14,180
No good God though.

2224
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:15,180
But it had structure.

2225
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:18,580
Unlike so many of the things that Alex thinks are jokes that are just like maybe something

2226
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:20,420
that's off color or offensive.

2227
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:21,420
Yeah.

2228
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:22,420
No, no, no.

2229
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:24,780
It's, it's grandpa at Thanksgiving and you're like, that was great.

2230
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:26,620
You didn't say anything about black lives matter.

2231
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:27,860
We're having a great time.

2232
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:32,100
We didn't bring up how much you love Song of the South this time, David.

2233
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:33,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2234
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:34,100
Yeah.

2235
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:37,520
So yeah, I thought that was so bizarre.

2236
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:41,280
Like I was looking at that, I'm like, this is InfoWars.

2237
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,740
He just made a joke and laughed at it.

2238
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:45,620
And that laugh did not seem fake.

2239
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:48,820
And did not use any old timey slurs in the process.

2240
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:50,140
Very bizarre.

2241
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:55,780
So it took a while and a lot of boring shit to get through, but we get to David talking

2242
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:58,780
about Steve Puchenik's story.

2243
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:03,500
But you'll notice that the way he's talking about it, he's very careful to talk about

2244
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:10,420
it as a story that's being posted on Reason.com as opposed to an interview his coworker had

2245
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:12,420
done the day before.

2246
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:13,420
Find me a little thread.

2247
01:36:13,420 --> 01:36:16,000
Trump's likeliest path appears to be narrower.

2248
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:21,340
He needs to hang on to both Pennsylvania and Georgia and he also needs to overtake Biden

2249
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:24,020
in either Nevada or Arizona.

2250
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:26,420
So that's where we are at the moment.

2251
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:29,480
But of course we know that this is all rigged.

2252
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:35,500
We know that it was all baked in, which is why I just about fell out of my chair when

2253
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:38,140
I saw this headline from Reason Magazine.

2254
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:40,500
Not when you were watching The War Room the day before.

2255
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:41,500
He doesn't watch The War Room.

2256
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,500
I wouldn't.

2257
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:47,940
So one thing I think is really interesting is that David Knight, his approach on it is

2258
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:51,860
very much like, this makes no sense.

2259
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:53,420
That's unfair.

2260
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:55,580
I appreciate it.

2261
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:58,780
To me, if this was a sting, it doesn't even make any sense.

2262
01:36:58,780 --> 01:37:01,500
It's another one of these deals like the laptop with Hunter Biden.

2263
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:05,060
They waited to the very last minute to put that thing out thinking it was going to be

2264
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,060
a surprise.

2265
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:10,660
And then everybody just said, well, it's not credible, but media is going to put out the

2266
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:11,660
narrative that's not credible.

2267
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:14,340
It doesn't matter if you've got documents, doesn't matter if you've got photographic

2268
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:15,340
evidence.

2269
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:18,620
You can have all the documentation that you want in the world and they're not going to

2270
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:21,700
believe it because the mainstream media and social media are going to censor you and they're

2271
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:23,580
going to put out their narrative.

2272
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:30,780
So I don't see that's going to do anything other than to create a forest fire.

2273
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:35,100
But the point he's trying to make, I would take issue with one little tweak.

2274
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:39,540
I'd make one little tweak, but it doesn't make sense because no one would believe this

2275
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:40,540
anyway.

2276
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:41,540
No, there is that.

2277
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:42,540
That makes sense.

2278
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:45,700
But his version of it is no one would believe it because the media would put out their own

2279
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:46,700
version.

2280
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:47,700
I don't agree with that.

2281
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:48,700
No, totally.

2282
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:50,760
I would say that everyone would be like, oh, fuck yourself.

2283
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:51,760
That is true.

2284
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,700
Probably if that story came out, people would just not believe it.

2285
01:37:55,700 --> 01:38:01,680
Wait, so he's saying that it is true, but that the media wouldn't believe it anyways?

2286
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:06,020
He's saying that they wouldn't do it because no one would believe it even if they did it.

2287
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:07,020
Oh, okay.

2288
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:08,020
I got you now.

2289
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:09,220
Basically, I think is what his point is.

2290
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:10,620
He's not saying that it happened.

2291
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:15,980
He's saying that they would have seen that happening ahead of time and not done the plan.

2292
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:19,780
The plan would have been fucked by no one believing it, so they wouldn't have gone down

2293
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:20,780
that road to begin with.

2294
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:21,780
Sure.

2295
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:22,780
That makes sense.

2296
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:23,780
Sure.

2297
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:24,780
I guess.

2298
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:25,780
I mean, however you get there is how you get there.

2299
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:26,780
I don't know.

2300
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:27,780
It doesn't make sense.

2301
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:28,780
No, no, no, no.

2302
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:29,780
Absolutely not.

2303
01:38:29,780 --> 01:38:32,020
If that's your reason why it doesn't make sense, you work at Infowars.

2304
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:33,020
Whatever.

2305
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:34,020
Fine.

2306
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:39,780
Now, in this last clip, he doesn't talk about it that much, but Steve does say something

2307
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:40,780
that I think is great.

2308
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:42,780
Do you mean David Knight?

2309
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:43,780
Yes.

2310
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:44,780
About Steve.

2311
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:45,780
Gotcha.

2312
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:50,540
David Knight says this thing that I think it's great, but also it's a classic Infowars

2313
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:55,140
thing where you're right, but you're wrong.

2314
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:56,140
You're right.

2315
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:57,140
Yes.

2316
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:58,140
But you are so wrong.

2317
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,140
Ah, the paradox.

2318
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:00,140
Look, I didn't jump into Pizzagate.

2319
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:04,420
I don't allow Pechenik to come on this show because last time he came on this show was

2320
01:39:04,420 --> 01:39:06,780
right after the shooting in Vegas.

2321
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:12,380
He came on this show to sell the lie that nobody died in Vegas because he's trying to

2322
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:14,020
trap me.

2323
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:20,060
This guy is a CIA shill and he comes on to trap us.

2324
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:23,580
That's one of the ways that they discredit you.

2325
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:25,300
I'm not having anything to do with that.

2326
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:26,300
We'll be right back.

2327
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:27,300
Stay with us.

2328
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:34,140
So, David's right that Steve is a fucking liar and he fucks with Infowars because he's

2329
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:38,600
in a unique position where he seems to be able to get away with it and he causes a lot

2330
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:39,600
of chaos.

2331
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,600
He has a great time.

2332
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,260
And I do believe that that is correct.

2333
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:46,460
I remember that episode where Steve was on with David Knight and he was talking about

2334
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:52,380
the Las Vegas shooting being fake and David Knight's reaction to that was, I agree with

2335
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:55,300
you that Sandy Hook was fake, but not this one.

2336
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:56,300
Yeah, I remember.

2337
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:59,260
That was even one where you pulled that clip from David Knight.

2338
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:00,260
I have that clip somewhere.

2339
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:01,580
That's how important that was to you.

2340
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:03,820
I have it in a folder somewhere.

2341
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:06,980
But I do agree with him.

2342
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:07,980
Don't have Steve on.

2343
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:09,740
It's a great thing you have that rule.

2344
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:11,980
Now, he's not a CIA shill.

2345
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:12,980
No.

2346
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:13,980
He's a bored man.

2347
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:14,980
Uh huh.

2348
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:15,980
In a condo in Florida.

2349
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:16,980
You got it.

2350
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:17,980
Who wants to fuck with you?

2351
01:40:17,980 --> 01:40:24,700
I don't understand how one out of three Infowars hosts is just like, this guy's a CIA shill

2352
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:29,060
who's trying to destroy our entire business and the other two are like, eh, come on, have

2353
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:30,060
a, come on in.

2354
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:34,500
Not only is he not a CIA shill, he is the best.

2355
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:35,500
Right.

2356
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:36,500
Exactly.

2357
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:37,500
Yeah.

2358
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:38,500
Yeah.

2359
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:42,140
If he's a CIA shill, he's tricked me.

2360
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:43,140
Oh.

2361
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:44,140
Oh shit.

2362
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:49,260
But here's, here's where this becomes a little bit less like of a severe problem because

2363
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:54,220
that does seem like a problem for like David Knight to be on air being like, Steve Pechenik

2364
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:58,980
is a CIA shill who's trying to trap me with these bullshit stories and that's how they

2365
01:40:58,980 --> 01:40:59,980
get you.

2366
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:01,740
Going all the way back to Las Vegas.

2367
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:02,740
Right.

2368
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:03,740
Yeah.

2369
01:41:03,740 --> 01:41:04,740
A long time.

2370
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:07,940
He's been on Alex's show since then saying a bunch of nonsense.

2371
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:12,700
And so by that token, David would have to think that he's trying to trap Alex.

2372
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:13,700
It would only make sense.

2373
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:18,700
And somehow that's fine to still work at the same place where that is going on.

2374
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:22,420
Or, or he's only trying to trap David Knight.

2375
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:23,420
David Knight is the white whale.

2376
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:25,540
He's the one that Steve is trying to get rid of.

2377
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:27,540
He's the big prize.

2378
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:28,540
Yeah.

2379
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:30,260
Uh, I don't think that's the case.

2380
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:33,620
I don't think anybody's particularly focused on David Knight.

2381
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:34,620
That's probably true.

2382
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:39,020
Um, but here's the thing, Alex has done this too.

2383
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:40,020
Yeah.

2384
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:45,300
Like after the Las Vegas shooting, Alex did turn on Steve for a little while and he did

2385
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:50,540
say to a caller, I think Steve is still working for the CIA and he's fucking with us.

2386
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:51,540
Yep.

2387
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:55,300
And then they made their peace after a couple months of Steve being on timeout.

2388
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:57,380
So that's probably what'll happen again.

2389
01:41:57,380 --> 01:41:58,380
Most likely.

2390
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:01,340
Although it's pretty funny.

2391
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:02,340
It's very funny.

2392
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:04,740
It's, it's really funny.

2393
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:11,820
And I think that the image of Owen being like, fuck you mainstream media, we're destroying

2394
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:12,820
you.

2395
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:16,940
That's the image of Info Wars 2020 election that I want to hold onto.

2396
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:22,700
And I want to remember, I want that to be sort of the spiritual energy that we're coming

2397
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:27,100
with as opposed to, you know, laughing at, oh, you lost.

2398
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:28,100
Yeah.

2399
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,740
I don't, I don't want to laugh at you for losing.

2400
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:34,900
I want to be glad that your candidate lost cause I hate the policies.

2401
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:38,100
But I want to laugh at you for taunting the mainstream media because you got tricked by

2402
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:39,100
Steve.

2403
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:40,160
So good.

2404
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:41,160
So good.

2405
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:44,080
You, and you will get tricked again.

2406
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:50,020
You think you're so smart and you think that Steve gave you a scoop.

2407
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:51,020
Yeah.

2408
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:53,980
If you got it, it's not a scoop.

2409
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:58,500
Steve's compliment to you.

2410
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:00,460
That guy worked for the CIA.

2411
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:03,380
He killed everybody.

2412
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:13,260
If you have Steve in 20 goddamn telling you that he chose your show, if he even smiled

2413
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:15,460
at me, I'm throwing a fastball at him.

2414
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:16,460
Yes.

2415
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:17,460
Something is up.

2416
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:18,460
Yeah.

2417
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:20,980
If he, if he wants to talk to you, he wants to use you.

2418
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:21,980
Right.

2419
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:22,980
Oh man.

2420
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:23,980
He's not a CIA shell.

2421
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:26,700
Oh, and oh, and really stop and think.

2422
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:33,380
If, if Steve was coming with big stuff this close to the election, this important a time

2423
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:38,700
period for, I guess, overthrowing the government, Alex isn't giving it to you.

2424
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:42,660
Oh, and I mean, it's not relative audience size is huge.

2425
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:45,660
It's a very big difference, a little bit of a difference.

2426
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:46,660
And yeah.

2427
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:47,660
Okay.

2428
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:48,660
I'm Steve.

2429
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:53,940
I got this big information that the election was actually secretly a sting operation.

2430
01:43:53,940 --> 01:44:04,700
I can't get permission to talk about it an hour early.

2431
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:05,700
I'm sorry.

2432
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:06,700
They had it on a clock.

2433
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:07,700
They had it on a clock.

2434
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:08,700
It was 4 PM.

2435
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:09,700
Eastern time.

2436
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:10,700
Shit.

2437
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:11,700
I could have done it at three.

2438
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:15,540
I mean, if you're Owen, you always got to be looking for reasons to think that you're

2439
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:18,540
like relevant and doing good work.

2440
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:19,540
Sure.

2441
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:23,140
Every now and again, you got to go yell at Congress and get walked out or something like

2442
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:24,140
that.

2443
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:26,020
You got to get, you got to get a high.

2444
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:29,920
And I guess if, you know, it's believing Steve is what does it for you.

2445
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:30,920
Sometimes it's got to do.

2446
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:34,580
Hey, everybody needs a little juice from here from here from time to pick yourself back

2447
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:37,100
up and get back on track.

2448
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:39,500
Don't don't quit, quit.

2449
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:40,860
This is so embarrassing.

2450
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:42,160
You should quit.

2451
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:43,160
You should quit.

2452
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:50,420
You said fudge you mainstream media because Steve Pachek told you that the entire election

2453
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:51,780
was a sting operation.

2454
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:53,260
It was an elaborate ruse.

2455
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:54,260
Oh boy.

2456
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:55,260
Uh, yeah.

2457
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:57,700
So this is episode 500, Jordan.

2458
01:44:57,700 --> 01:44:58,700
Dan?

2459
01:44:58,700 --> 01:44:59,700
Yep.

2460
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:00,700
500 episodes, huh?

2461
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:01,700
Quite a few.

2462
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:02,700
That's weird.

2463
01:45:02,700 --> 01:45:03,700
Uh huh.

2464
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:04,700
This is how we celebrate.

2465
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:05,700
Yeah.

2466
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:06,700
Yeah.

2467
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:07,700
That's about right.

2468
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:08,700
This, this is how we celebrate.

2469
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:09,700
Okay.

2470
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:18,420
Ladies and gentlemen, we're back in the Infowars war room devastating the fake news media today

2471
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:21,420
with Dr. Steve Pachek.

2472
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:23,780
I want to talk more about that clip.

2473
01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:24,780
Uh huh.

2474
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:25,780
I love it for so many reasons.

2475
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:26,780
Yeah.

2476
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:30,980
First of all, you've got that sort of new metal base going behind it, which is great.

2477
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:32,220
It's setting the tone nicely.

2478
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:33,580
Oh, that's a six string bass.

2479
01:45:33,580 --> 01:45:34,580
You can tell.

2480
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:37,860
We're devastating the fake news media.

2481
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:44,300
Fake news media is what's being devastated with Steve Pachek while we talk bullshit.

2482
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:47,360
Does Owen work for the CIA?

2483
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:48,900
My eyes just got really wide.

2484
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:49,900
Right?

2485
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:52,180
I've broken some serious news to you, Dan.

2486
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:53,740
You know where the CIA is based?

2487
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:54,740
Where?

2488
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:55,740
St. Louis.

2489
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:56,740
All right.

2490
01:45:56,740 --> 01:45:59,740
I don't think it is, but that's where Owen's from.

2491
01:45:59,740 --> 01:46:03,780
Anyway, we'll be back for episode five Oh one indeed.

2492
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:05,500
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

2493
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:06,500
We do have a website.

2494
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:07,500
It's knowledgefight.com.

2495
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:08,500
Yeah.

2496
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:09,500
We're also on Twitter.

2497
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:10,500
We are on Twitter.

2498
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:11,500
It's at knowledge, under quite an act.

2499
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:12,500
Go to bet.

2500
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:13,500
Jordan was on Facebook review.

2501
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:18,740
And if you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area of the fights.

2502
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:19,740
Not over.

2503
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:20,740
Yep.

2504
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:21,740
We'll be back.

2505
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:22,740
But until then, I'm Neo.

2506
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:23,740
I'm Leo.

2507
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:24,740
I'm DZX Clark.

2508
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:26,380
I am Daryl Rundis.

2509
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:31,340
I'm devastating the fake news media with Steve Fagampagenic.

2510
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:32,340
Andy in Kansas.

2511
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:33,340
You're on the air.

2512
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:34,340
Thanks for holding.

2513
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:35,340
Hello, Alex.

2514
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:36,340
I'm a first time caller.

2515
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:37,340
I'm a huge fan.

2516
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:38,340
I love your work.

2517
01:46:38,340 --> 01:47:06,340
I love you.
