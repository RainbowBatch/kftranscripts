Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am sweating

00:18.040 --> 00:21.280
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

00:21.280 --> 00:23.880
I have great respect for Knowledgefight

Knowledgefight

00:25.160 --> 00:27.400
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

Saying we are the bad guys

Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us

00:49.440 --> 00:51.800
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan

00:51.800 --> 00:53.000
I love your room

N-N-N-N-N-Knowledgefight.com

00:57.000 --> 00:59.440
I love you

00:59.440 --> 01:01.320
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan

01:01.320 --> 01:01.920
I'm Jordan

01:01.920 --> 01:04.080
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages

01:04.080 --> 01:05.880
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:05.880 --> 01:07.360
Oh indeed we are Dan

01:07.360 --> 01:07.800
Jordan

01:07.800 --> 01:08.440
Dan!

01:08.440 --> 01:09.120
Jordan!

01:09.120 --> 01:09.880
Quick question for you

01:09.880 --> 01:10.360
What's up?

01:10.360 --> 01:11.240
What's your bright spot today?

01:11.240 --> 01:16.040
My bright spot today, Jordan, is something, it actually happened a little bit back

01:16.040 --> 01:21.640
but it's something I've been reflecting on and it's appropriate for the 500th episode

01:21.640 --> 01:22.320
that we're doing here

01:22.320 --> 01:25.960
Oh, nice way to smooth in that little 500 reference

01:25.960 --> 01:29.080
Yeah, for sure, I'm very, you know, so it's all about smoothness

01:29.080 --> 01:30.280
I like it, I like it

01:30.280 --> 01:38.640
Um, so I recently was asked or invited by listener Sarah Beth to give a little bit of a Q&A session

01:38.640 --> 01:43.440
discussion with a college course that she presides over

01:43.440 --> 01:51.800
and it was just such a rewarding, interesting experience to be, you know, asked to talk to these college students

01:51.800 --> 01:55.560
about, you know, issues like researching topics

01:55.560 --> 01:58.000
and it was, it was amazing

01:58.000 --> 02:02.560
and I can't thank Sarah Beth enough for inviting me and these kids were great

02:02.560 --> 02:04.040
Although scary, I'm scared

02:04.040 --> 02:04.760
Sure, sure

02:04.760 --> 02:05.800
I'm scared of college kids

02:05.800 --> 02:06.640
Sure, naturally

02:06.640 --> 02:10.240
For one, because they look so young and they are adults, technically

02:10.240 --> 02:10.480
Yeah

02:10.480 --> 02:11.560
That scares the shit out of me

02:11.560 --> 02:13.200
Yeah, that is a problem

02:13.200 --> 02:18.080
And then also, like, I remember back when I was in college, I would just be disapproving by nature

02:18.080 --> 02:20.480
sort of like the default look on your face is

02:20.480 --> 02:21.200
Sure, sure, sure, sure

02:21.200 --> 02:22.280
Yeah, you're in class

02:22.280 --> 02:22.880
Yeah, yeah

02:22.880 --> 02:27.080
You know, I'm used to being a stand-up and I want to elicit a response

02:27.080 --> 02:27.600
Sure, sure

02:27.600 --> 02:28.840
A positive response from the

02:28.840 --> 02:29.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah

02:29.520 --> 02:34.520
And so it's always tough to imagine, like, just even myself back in college

02:34.520 --> 02:35.040
Oh, yeah

02:35.040 --> 02:37.040
Like, to try and look at my face

02:37.040 --> 02:38.240
Trying to convey a message

02:38.240 --> 02:42.320
You know, we've had plenty of friends who've gone back and forth from doing stand-up and teaching

02:42.320 --> 02:44.400
You know, like they were teachers while they were stand-ups

02:44.400 --> 02:50.480
and it never occurred to me that you would have to stand up in front of all the same types of people

02:50.480 --> 02:53.240
but they don't make a response at all

02:53.240 --> 02:53.720
Yeah, it's

02:53.720 --> 02:54.320
That's infuriating

02:54.320 --> 02:57.280
It's terrifying because they're a crowd, but they're not a crowd

02:57.280 --> 02:58.240
Yeah, they're not a crowd

02:58.240 --> 02:58.640
Yeah

02:58.640 --> 02:59.960
I can't do crowd work

02:59.960 --> 03:02.760
I'm not going to do a little five minutes up top every time

03:02.760 --> 03:04.040
No, that's not going to work

03:04.040 --> 03:07.160
Yeah, so thank you so much to Sarah Beth and those students

03:07.160 --> 03:08.720
It was just a great experience

03:08.720 --> 03:09.680
That's really cool

03:09.680 --> 03:11.080
First time

03:11.080 --> 03:13.720
I get to call myself a guest lecturer now

03:13.720 --> 03:14.400
I think

03:14.400 --> 03:15.320
I believe you do

03:15.320 --> 03:16.080
I can put that in my title

03:16.080 --> 03:17.800
I believe you do, that's in there

03:17.800 --> 03:18.800
Yeah, so how about you?

03:18.800 --> 03:25.000
Oh, my bright spot, Dan, normally would be that Assassin's Creed Valhalla is coming out

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Sure, but not yet

03:26.000 --> 03:27.480
Not yet, it's not here

03:27.480 --> 03:30.960
Although we set a bad precedent with me being able to do a preemptive one with Pikmin

03:30.960 --> 03:32.240
That's true, that's true

03:32.240 --> 03:37.840
But I won't be choosing that because, Dan, my audiobook is finished and it is up on the website

03:37.840 --> 03:40.840
for everybody to download at their leisure

03:40.840 --> 03:41.600
Congratulations

03:41.600 --> 03:43.680
Yeah, it was cool, it was really fun to do

03:43.680 --> 03:45.440
Thank you very much for helping me produce it

03:45.440 --> 03:47.040
Sure, made a tiny cameo

03:47.040 --> 03:48.320
Yeah, absolutely

03:48.320 --> 03:53.040
Yeah, if you read it, there are some easter eggs and some weird things that are there on purpose

03:53.040 --> 03:56.600
I promise you to confuse you and kind of disorient things for a little bit

03:56.600 --> 03:57.200
Awesome

03:57.200 --> 03:57.760
Yeah, yeah

03:57.760 --> 03:59.960
And people can find that at thequietpartloud.com

03:59.960 --> 04:01.640
Indeed, yep, that's where they can find it

04:01.640 --> 04:07.120
I'm very proud of you, I'm excited that it's out and people can enjoy the fruits of your labor

04:07.120 --> 04:10.600
by which I mean screaming in my apartment

04:10.600 --> 04:15.360
If you want to go straight from listening to four hours of us talk

04:15.360 --> 04:20.640
and then instead get rid of the best part of this podcast, I think it's a great idea to listen to my audiobook

04:20.640 --> 04:24.120
Get rid of me and replace it with you doing voices

04:24.120 --> 04:25.400
More me, yeah

04:25.400 --> 04:26.280
Very exciting

04:26.280 --> 04:27.320
Yeah, it's not great

04:27.320 --> 04:29.800
Um, that's great, despite what you say

04:29.800 --> 04:32.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's awesome, I'm very happy about it

04:32.360 --> 04:35.600
So, Jordan, today we got an interesting thing to do

04:35.600 --> 04:40.600
We're going to be talking about a little bit of Election Time Infowars

04:40.600 --> 04:43.840
Oh, yay, I've been hearing about things

04:43.840 --> 04:48.480
But things might be a little bit different than what people could have expected

04:48.480 --> 04:53.360
Last week, Jordan, we talked about how it would be too difficult to do an episode about the election

04:53.360 --> 04:55.880
to be released on that Wednesday

04:55.880 --> 04:59.880
And that remained true when it came time to record Friday's episode

04:59.880 --> 05:02.480
At that point, there was just too much uncertainty

05:02.480 --> 05:08.720
It felt very difficult to discuss the whole thing without having any feelings of closure about the election itself

05:08.720 --> 05:13.880
Now, as it stands on Sunday, as we record Monday's show, there's a bit more of a sense of finality

05:13.880 --> 05:20.360
All the networks have called the race for Biden, and it looks like the basis for any kind of legal challenge Trump's campaign could make

05:20.360 --> 05:23.480
It'll be weak, and it'll probably go nowhere

05:23.480 --> 05:30.520
Everybody celebrating the Biden win owes a huge raise of the glass to the on-the-ground organizers and voter registration activists

05:30.520 --> 05:33.480
in those battleground states that could easily have gone the other way

05:33.480 --> 05:34.240
Oh, easily

05:34.240 --> 05:41.760
It's still mind-blowing that it was anywhere near that close, but right now our country probably owes a deep debt of gratitude to a ton of people

05:41.760 --> 05:43.920
whose names you'll likely never know

05:43.920 --> 05:46.800
So, now, there's a bit more of a sense of what's going on

05:46.800 --> 05:51.200
I feel like I'm standing on more solid ground, so it's time to get to Alex's election coverage

05:51.200 --> 05:52.200
Let's see what happened

05:52.200 --> 05:53.920
Or maybe not

05:53.920 --> 05:57.040
As I reflected over the weekend, I had a bit of...

05:57.040 --> 05:58.480
I do like that twist

05:58.480 --> 06:03.120
That was a very good... I was like, yeah, that was the time when you're like, or maybe not, fuck you, Dan

06:03.120 --> 06:05.320
I had a bit of a realization, Jordan

06:05.320 --> 06:10.800
A large part of the motivation for me doing this podcast was my revulsion at seeing Alex and his crew laughing

06:10.800 --> 06:14.880
at the diverse crowds of Hillary supporters crying on election night 2016

06:14.880 --> 06:20.160
mocking what was, for many of them, a very real and justified existential fear

06:20.160 --> 06:27.640
So now, the tables are turned a little bit, and we have an opportunity to laugh at his behavior on election night when things didn't go his way

06:27.640 --> 06:31.400
Do we mock his tears, comfortable in the knowledge that they're probably fake?

06:31.400 --> 06:35.480
And even if they are real, the things he's afraid of aren't real?

06:35.480 --> 06:40.880
Is it just as bad for me to do a show where I relish in his election night lows?

06:40.880 --> 06:45.360
Obviously, the answer to that is no, it wouldn't be just as bad for me to do that

06:45.360 --> 06:45.880
Oh, of course not

06:45.880 --> 06:48.160
It would be totally cool, and maybe fun

06:48.160 --> 06:50.120
It'd be fine, it'd be great, I'd love it

06:50.120 --> 06:53.640
But also, I'm not going to do that, but for slightly different reasons

06:53.640 --> 06:57.120
What Alex Jones did on election night literally doesn't matter

06:57.120 --> 07:01.160
We can mock his freaking out and yelling the same bullshit he yells every day

07:01.160 --> 07:07.720
We can discuss his very dubious claim that he decided not to go on Rogan's livestream of his own accord

07:07.720 --> 07:12.040
We can talk about his obvious intentions to incite violence, but here's the thing

07:12.040 --> 07:18.120
The most disrespectful thing I think you can do in terms of Alex's election night coverage

07:18.120 --> 07:22.320
is to treat it how it deserves to be treated, and that's to say, who gives a shit?

07:22.320 --> 07:23.120
You asshole

07:23.120 --> 07:24.160
Eh, get the fuck out of here

07:24.160 --> 07:27.880
The lashing out, the tears, the yelling about demons, it's all meaningless

07:27.880 --> 07:32.560
Some pills might have gotten sold, but if I'm going for schadenfreude, I'm not going halfway

07:32.560 --> 07:37.280
And saying, we'll talk about your election coverage sometime, but it's totally not important now

07:37.280 --> 07:42.720
That's way harsher than playing clips of Alex yelling nonsense and then saying, haha, your guy lost

07:42.720 --> 07:43.560
Yeah, that's true

07:43.560 --> 07:47.480
So we're going to talk about the election coverage another time

07:47.480 --> 07:50.000
Maybe a year from now, who knows, I don't know

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
But it's not out of respect for Alex and his crew in this difficult time, but out of a deeper disrespect

07:56.000 --> 07:56.680
I'd like it

07:56.680 --> 07:59.120
So fuck all of you at Infowars

07:59.120 --> 08:03.680
Yeah, this is a straight up needful things twist that you have right here

08:03.680 --> 08:07.160
The reality is that Alex is now entering uncharted territory

08:07.160 --> 08:12.480
His audience has been led to believe that any non-Trump win would be the result of large-scale election fraud

08:12.480 --> 08:15.600
thereby making any Biden presidency illegitimate

08:15.600 --> 08:21.560
Further, he's extensively characterized his opponents, from high-level politicians to street-level activists

08:21.560 --> 08:25.720
as pedophiles and vampires in the employ of the literal Christian devil

08:25.720 --> 08:33.160
Over and over again, he said that Trump getting elected was the equivalent of the biblical story of God giving a reprieve to Nineveh

08:33.160 --> 08:38.520
In that story, Jonah is enlisted by God to warn the people of Nineveh to repent of their evil ways

08:38.520 --> 08:40.400
But he decides to go somewhere else

08:40.400 --> 08:43.920
He ends up getting swallowed by a whale and then realizes, I got a job to do

08:43.920 --> 08:47.200
So he goes to Nineveh after he gets out of the whale

08:47.200 --> 08:49.640
And then he convinces everyone there to repent

08:49.640 --> 08:52.760
thereby saving the city from God's judgment and destruction

08:52.760 --> 08:57.720
According to the way Alex characterizes Trump's role as being reminiscent of this story

08:57.720 --> 09:02.440
combined with the people of the United States not deciding to repent by getting on board with Trump

09:02.440 --> 09:05.680
this naturally leads to a different conclusion than Jonah's story

09:05.680 --> 09:08.080
We're all gonna get eaten by a bigger whale

09:08.080 --> 09:13.080
This is kind of more like Sodom and Gomorrah in the way that Alex is characterizing it

09:13.080 --> 09:17.360
If you take Alex seriously, Alex has taught his audience that his enemies are literal demons

09:17.360 --> 09:22.720
dead set on the killing of the entire planet to appease Lucifer and turn into robots or whatever

09:22.720 --> 09:26.640
and that Trump was the US's only chance to repent and be saved

09:26.640 --> 09:32.280
Now that that has been passed, it seems like it's time to become a full-on wrath of God doomsday preacher

09:32.280 --> 09:35.200
That's one possible avenue Alex could be going down

09:35.200 --> 09:37.840
I honestly have no idea what Alex's pivot will be

09:37.840 --> 09:41.560
but I'm interested to see how much of the stuff he retains and how much he just pretends

09:41.560 --> 09:43.040
I never said that shit

09:43.040 --> 09:46.520
His audience is captured so he could just start walking another direction

09:46.520 --> 09:49.800
and as long as he talks fast enough and jingles those keys around

09:49.800 --> 09:52.200
he'll retain some percentage of the audience

09:52.200 --> 09:57.360
Some new lieutenant colonel will tell Alex about some new piece of intel that'll make everything make sense

09:57.360 --> 10:01.240
how there's still good guys fighting off the devil inside the government or something

10:01.240 --> 10:02.600
We'll see what he ends up doing

10:02.600 --> 10:05.840
but I've learned not just to assume that the boat is gonna sink

10:05.840 --> 10:09.320
because it looks like, boy, that boat has gotta sink

10:09.320 --> 10:11.360
Alex still has a few cards left to play

10:11.360 --> 10:17.720
The boat should have enough holes in it and his box should have no air holes in it

10:17.720 --> 10:20.600
and that should be enough to take him down, but it doesn't seem to be

10:20.600 --> 10:21.720
For sure

10:21.720 --> 10:27.360
So I'm going to leave desperate and intensely boring electoral Alex to his games

10:27.360 --> 10:33.200
He can try to whip up excitement about his attempt at branding Trump's lame duck session as the 79 days of hell

10:33.200 --> 10:35.040
but I don't think that's gonna catch on

10:35.040 --> 10:38.960
and I wouldn't be surprised if Alex even loses interest in it before January comes around

10:38.960 --> 10:39.520
Oh yeah

10:39.520 --> 10:40.840
But where does that leave us?

10:40.840 --> 10:43.000
What are we gonna cover here for today's episode?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.520
Episode 500

10:44.520 --> 10:48.320
Well, I've found that this show works best when I follow my heart and my instincts

10:48.320 --> 10:50.720
and there's only one thing that I want to talk about today

10:50.720 --> 10:56.200
and that's how Infowars has been reeling at the beginning of this 79 days of hell

10:56.200 --> 10:59.560
We could talk about Alex going to Maricopa County on Thursday

10:59.560 --> 11:03.640
and using an adult-sized bullhorn to yell about how they needed to stop counting ballots

11:03.640 --> 11:06.320
but honestly that just seems like a waste of time

11:06.320 --> 11:08.080
The race in Arizona has been called for Biden

11:08.080 --> 11:14.200
and honestly that wasn't much more than a sad and entirely predictable publicity stunt on Alex's part

11:14.200 --> 11:16.440
No, that would be a waste of time

11:16.440 --> 11:19.080
What I want to discuss is something far more important

11:19.080 --> 11:23.720
which is what happens to a propaganda outlet that's run by a tyrannical central authority

11:23.720 --> 11:26.400
when their anointed God King is losing an election

11:26.400 --> 11:31.120
and their tyrannical central authority runs off to Arizona to do a publicity stunt

11:31.120 --> 11:35.560
How does the leaderless and almost certainly confused underling who works there

11:35.560 --> 11:37.560
how do they keep the operation going?

11:37.560 --> 11:38.560
How do they respond?

11:38.560 --> 11:40.000
Wait, how long has he been gone?

11:40.000 --> 11:44.560
Well, he's back now but in the period he left on Thursday after his show

11:44.560 --> 11:46.920
and then I think he got back on like Saturday

11:46.920 --> 11:49.880
Okay, so for two days he just wasn't there

11:49.880 --> 11:51.960
He might have been back on Friday, I'm not entirely sure

11:51.960 --> 11:56.640
We're going to be covering Thursday evening into Friday morning

11:56.640 --> 12:00.240
and just sort of what goes on when the daddy's gone

12:00.240 --> 12:03.960
Right, so we're going to watch a bunch of incompetent people scramble around

12:03.960 --> 12:04.440
A little bit

12:04.440 --> 12:05.280
and it's going to be fantastic

12:05.280 --> 12:05.960
A little bit

12:05.960 --> 12:08.400
We're also going to hear Alex's show on Thursday

12:08.400 --> 12:10.080
A bit of that as well

12:10.080 --> 12:12.560
I present to you, Jordan, episode 500

12:12.560 --> 12:16.560
or why Infowars doesn't work without Alex

12:16.560 --> 12:17.160
Okay

12:17.160 --> 12:19.600
But before we get down to business on that

12:19.600 --> 12:23.280
got to give a shout out to folks who have made these past 500 episodes possible

12:23.280 --> 12:24.760
Oh, nicely done

12:24.760 --> 12:28.800
So first, KevKev, please, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

12:28.800 --> 12:29.880
I'm a policy wonk

12:29.880 --> 12:31.400
Thank you very much, KevKev

12:31.400 --> 12:34.640
Thank you, next, DJ Booth, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

12:34.640 --> 12:35.720
I'm a policy wonk

12:35.720 --> 12:36.760
Thanks, DJ Booth

12:36.760 --> 12:40.000
Thank you so much, next, SickFucker, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

12:40.000 --> 12:41.040
I'm a policy wonk

12:41.040 --> 12:42.520
Thanks, SickFucker

12:42.520 --> 12:44.760
Also, that's just all vowels taken out

12:44.760 --> 12:47.180
I didn't know how else to… I couldn't just say so...

12:47.180 --> 12:51.280
Anyway, Dr. Milton Wigglesworth, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

12:51.280 --> 12:52.400
I'm a policy wonk

12:52.400 --> 12:53.840
Thank you very much, Dr. Milton

12:53.840 --> 12:57.200
Thank you, next Antifa Bogeyman, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

12:57.200 --> 12:58.200
I'm a policy wonk

12:58.200 --> 13:00.440
Ah, thank you very much, Antifa Bogeyman

13:00.440 --> 13:04.240
Thank you, next, Amber A, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

13:04.240 --> 13:05.240
I'm a policy wonk

13:05.240 --> 13:06.080
Thanks, Amber

13:06.080 --> 13:09.680
Thank you, next, Kristopher R, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

13:09.680 --> 13:10.800
I'm a policy wonk

13:10.800 --> 13:12.000
Thanks, Christopher

13:12.000 --> 13:15.720
And then I'd like to give a shout-out to someone who donated on Elevated Level, we appreciate

13:15.720 --> 13:16.880
that very much.

13:16.880 --> 13:22.880
And this person has a bone to pick with someone named Peter from Denmark, one of our listeners,

13:22.880 --> 13:27.240
who is the ordained ruler of the wonks in Denmark.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.240
I did not know that.

13:28.240 --> 13:34.040
There apparently is tension in Denmark, and there may actually be a bit of a feud.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.840
Are you saying there's literally trouble in Denmark?

13:35.840 --> 13:37.280
There may be trouble in Denmark.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.920
All right, okay.

13:39.920 --> 13:44.880
We have a contender for the title of blank of Denmark.

13:44.880 --> 13:45.880
Okay.

13:45.880 --> 13:48.520
So we have Peter from Denmark, who's now been the from Denmark.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.520
He's the only from Denmark.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.800
But now we have Dines M from Denmark.

13:52.800 --> 13:53.800
Thank you so much.

13:53.800 --> 13:54.800
You are now a technocrat.

13:54.800 --> 13:55.800
I'm a policy wonk.

13:55.800 --> 13:56.800
Crikey, mate.

13:56.800 --> 13:57.800
That's fantastic.

13:57.800 --> 13:58.800
Have yourself a brew.

13:58.800 --> 13:59.800
How's your 401k doing, bro?

13:59.800 --> 14:02.560
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

14:02.560 --> 14:04.060
Let's just get down to business.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.120
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.060
Why are you pimps so good?

14:08.060 --> 14:09.700
My neck is freakishly large.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.360
I declare info war on you.

14:12.360 --> 14:13.360
Thank you so much, Dines.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.720
Yes, thank you very much, Dines from Denmark.

14:15.720 --> 14:19.800
I'm going to stay out of this conflict and see who comes out on top, and then say that

14:19.800 --> 14:21.480
I was always on this side to pick it up.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.480
What are you, Ireland?

14:22.480 --> 14:23.480
Come on now.

14:23.480 --> 14:28.080
Finally, a special wonk shout out I'd like to make is to Bex, who sent us a wonderful

14:28.080 --> 14:29.840
care package a while back.

14:29.840 --> 14:34.240
I thought that we'd done the whole technocrat shout out, but I believe we might have forgotten,

14:34.240 --> 14:35.240
or maybe...

14:35.240 --> 14:36.240
I'm not entirely sure what happened.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.600
I believe we've already done it in the past.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.600
Maybe.

14:38.600 --> 14:42.640
There are a handful of us, if we did mess up or miss it, so I want to attempt to right

14:42.640 --> 14:46.240
this wrong by declaring that Bex, you're not a technocrat.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.640
No, no, no, no.

14:47.640 --> 14:51.720
You're a raptor princess, and in honor of that, I've made a special drop.

14:51.720 --> 14:56.480
There was a request that we use the old technocrat drop because it included the Daddy Shark clip,

14:56.480 --> 15:00.440
but I decided that it would be better if I just made a new one, which also included the

15:00.440 --> 15:01.440
Daddy Shark one.

15:01.440 --> 15:04.280
It's 45 seconds of just the Daddy Shark one on repeat, isn't it?

15:04.280 --> 15:05.280
That'd be great.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.280
That'd be great.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.280
So thank you so much, Bex.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.680
Also, thank you for...

15:09.680 --> 15:14.560
We got a special episode 500 package that we're going to be opening on a bonus episode

15:14.560 --> 15:20.000
that'll be out on Friday from Bex, and I don't know what's in it, but it looks cool.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
It's very exciting.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
It's very thoughtful and awesome.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
I'm very excited.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Yes.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.520
We appreciate you very much, and my apologies that I'm absolutely terrible at social media

15:27.520 --> 15:28.520
correspondences.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.020
This one's going out to you, Bex.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.020
Thank you so much.

15:31.020 --> 15:32.120
You are now a raptor princess.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.120
I'm a policy wonk.

15:33.120 --> 15:38.500
You know, they got Baby Shark, deet deet deet deet deet deet, Hillary Clinton.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.440
It's fun to laugh at Alex Jones.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.440
It's fun.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.120
No, my religion is facts.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.340
Get that through your peep ring.

15:44.340 --> 15:47.480
They got Mama Shark, beep beep, beep beep beep.

15:47.480 --> 15:51.000
I'm dead inside.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.400
I have no guilt.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.560
I'm a really good guy.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.320
There's three ways to learn, or maybe four.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.880
I am that Messiah.

15:56.880 --> 15:57.880
What can I do?

15:57.880 --> 15:58.880
Daddy Shark.

15:58.880 --> 15:59.880
I hate myself.

15:59.880 --> 16:04.880
And I feel like a complete failure.

16:04.880 --> 16:05.880
Thank you so much, Bex.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.880
Thank you very much, Bex.

16:07.880 --> 16:08.880
Oh.

16:08.880 --> 16:09.880
That's a wonderful new drop.

16:09.880 --> 16:10.960
It will never be played again.

16:10.960 --> 16:11.960
Never be played again.

16:11.960 --> 16:12.960
One time only use.

16:12.960 --> 16:13.960
Absolutely.

16:13.960 --> 16:14.960
All right.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.200
So, Jordan, now let's jump into this episode.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.200
Let's do it.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.200
Because we are deep into this.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.200
All right.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.200
All right.

16:20.200 --> 16:23.000
So, we're going to start here on November 5th.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.520
We are past the election.

16:24.520 --> 16:25.520
Alex is reeling.

16:25.520 --> 16:30.900
You know, the count is still going on, but all indications are that, you know, things

16:30.900 --> 16:34.160
are not looking that great for Trump to win.

16:34.160 --> 16:38.600
There's a number of paths, but they all involve winning Pennsylvania, and then some other

16:38.600 --> 16:40.960
things also.

16:40.960 --> 16:46.680
Hope is getting, you know, at that point, it's getting to the area where some conservatives

16:46.680 --> 16:48.320
are talking rebrand.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:49.720 --> 16:54.200
Alex is a little bit like Wile E. Coyote in that Trump is the roadrunner who painted the

16:54.200 --> 16:59.040
way forward on the wall, and Alex is the one who crashes headfirst into reality.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.040
Exactly.

17:00.040 --> 17:01.040
He hits the barbed wire.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.040
Not good.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.040
So, here's where he's at.

17:04.040 --> 17:08.660
Now, let me give you the big announcement here.

17:08.660 --> 17:15.220
If Joe Biden gets in, they're never getting rid of the lockdown.

17:15.220 --> 17:17.360
Think about that.

17:17.360 --> 17:21.020
It's a lot bigger than just kicking Trump out and flooding everything with fake ballots

17:21.020 --> 17:23.820
using the lockdown as the cover for it.

17:23.820 --> 17:28.400
They want to bankrupt us and then have us have an app to be able to leave our front

17:28.400 --> 17:30.940
door and step one foot outside of our house.

17:30.940 --> 17:33.400
That is the admitted globalist chai con plan.

17:33.400 --> 17:39.260
So I guess that's now the angle is if Biden gets in, then the lockdown is never going

17:39.260 --> 17:40.260
to end.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.400
COVID's here forever or something.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.600
I kind of think that one might even be hard for his followers to buy.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.600
Yeah.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.600
Really, you're going to say that Joe Biden is just going to say everyone stay inside.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.300
Also, what do you want us to do now?

17:53.300 --> 17:54.300
The election's over.

17:54.300 --> 17:55.300
Yeah.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.300
What are you trying to...

17:56.300 --> 18:00.660
Also, furthermore, the lockdown already happened and nobody listened to it anyways.

18:00.660 --> 18:03.820
What are we going to, what's Biden going to change about that?

18:03.820 --> 18:08.800
He's going to have even less evil fucking DHS coming into people's homes.

18:08.800 --> 18:14.140
He seems probably less willing to use a lot of the force that Trump has been.

18:14.140 --> 18:15.980
I mean, except for against left-wing protesters.

18:15.980 --> 18:22.100
Well, but look, man, there was an election and it was fraught with fraud.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.100
There's a lot of it.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.100
I remember that.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.500
Well, maybe you didn't hear about this.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.500
Oh, okay.

18:26.500 --> 18:30.580
And there's videos of what appear to be Chinese individuals in Michigan arriving with those

18:30.580 --> 18:37.120
ballots at 4 a.m. illegally and going into the buildings with ballot boxes that then

18:37.120 --> 18:38.740
were all for Biden.

18:38.740 --> 18:42.100
The arrogance level is so atrocious.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.780
I don't even know.

18:43.780 --> 18:53.700
So, is he implying that China sent people from China to Michigan with marked ballots

18:53.700 --> 18:54.820
for Biden?

18:54.820 --> 18:58.660
These marked ballots ostensibly also coming from China.

18:58.660 --> 19:02.900
Well, and the box itself is the only thing that you probably see in the videos.

19:02.900 --> 19:05.580
It has to say ballots for Biden on the box.

19:05.580 --> 19:07.580
Exactly, with the Chinese flag.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.820
That's the only thing that makes sense.

19:09.820 --> 19:11.860
There were a bunch of these videos that were going around.

19:11.860 --> 19:14.940
There were drastic misrepresentations of things.

19:14.940 --> 19:20.540
There was one that was a television crew that was unloading gear that people thought were

19:20.540 --> 19:22.300
ballots going in.

19:22.300 --> 19:28.020
Then there was a video that went around that was actually from years ago in Russia that

19:28.020 --> 19:31.660
people were just saying was from one of these states.

19:31.660 --> 19:33.900
Yeah, there's just a hundred of these things.

19:33.900 --> 19:38.740
And Alex has really latched on to the idea that there was a suspicious, possibly Chinese

19:38.740 --> 19:39.740
person.

19:39.740 --> 19:42.180
Yeah, that's real.

19:42.180 --> 19:49.980
That's just real sad on a conspiracy level of just like, man, they could have mailed

19:49.980 --> 19:53.620
them to San Francisco and had a white person drive them there.

19:53.620 --> 20:00.580
Why would you fly directly from China to... What did they land on top of the ballot counting

20:00.580 --> 20:02.540
building in a helicopter?

20:02.540 --> 20:06.740
Look, there's a lot of problems with this from just sort of a real world perspective,

20:06.740 --> 20:12.300
but you listen to it and you can kind of hear what his, like where he's coming from.

20:12.300 --> 20:15.780
You can see why this is the story that he's telling.

20:15.780 --> 20:22.100
So Alex is, I would say, pretty close to a line.

20:22.100 --> 20:28.420
And that line is what I like to call the saying, hey, let's do some offensive violence line.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.060
He's pretty close to that line.

20:30.060 --> 20:37.460
They are involved in a revolution fully conquering the United States and killing our republic

20:37.460 --> 20:43.780
and they're hammering the last nails into the damn coffin to bury us alive as slaves

20:43.780 --> 20:46.380
of their system.

20:46.380 --> 20:47.660
So I'm not a macho guy.

20:47.660 --> 20:50.340
I don't say things just to say them, but I'll tell you this.

20:50.340 --> 20:51.340
Yeah, you do.

20:51.340 --> 20:58.900
I'm not going to launch any offensive violence at this point because I've not had time to

20:58.900 --> 21:03.020
really think about the right course in history.

21:03.020 --> 21:04.820
But I know this.

21:04.820 --> 21:08.900
If we let them steal this election and we let them put a Chinese communist agent who's

21:08.900 --> 21:14.340
fully compromised with all the proof in there to have control of the nuclear codes, all

21:14.340 --> 21:19.100
of us are aiding and abetting the destruction of our country and the handover to the most

21:19.100 --> 21:22.380
authoritarian nation the world's ever seen, communist China.

21:22.380 --> 21:28.100
And I will not be an accomplice and I will not aid and abet this type of takeover.

21:28.100 --> 21:32.900
So if I understand correctly what he's saying, first of all, I have to take issue with the

21:32.900 --> 21:35.500
idea that he said, I haven't had time to think about.

21:35.500 --> 21:36.500
Yeah.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.220
You've done nothing but talk about this.

21:38.220 --> 21:41.820
I would suggest that you've been thinking about this almost nonstop for-

21:41.820 --> 21:42.820
Since 1995.

21:42.820 --> 21:43.820
Yeah.

21:43.820 --> 21:44.820
You've been talking about it on air since-

21:44.820 --> 21:46.740
That's pretty much the only thing you've been talking about.

21:46.740 --> 21:50.900
I haven't given any thought to when you start being violent.

21:50.900 --> 21:51.900
Wow.

21:51.900 --> 21:52.900
Wow.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.300
The course of history, blah, blah, blah.

21:54.300 --> 21:55.300
Yeah.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.300
What is the course of history?

21:56.300 --> 22:00.940
Well, if you understand what he's saying, he's saying that Joe Biden is controlled by

22:00.940 --> 22:01.940
China.

22:01.940 --> 22:02.940
Yes.

22:02.940 --> 22:08.580
So if we, by we, I mean, Alex and the Patriots, if we allow Joe Biden to take office with

22:08.580 --> 22:14.220
the nuclear codes and what have you, you are complicit in aiding and abetting the Chinese

22:14.220 --> 22:15.980
communist takeover.

22:15.980 --> 22:21.180
So I mean, that would be the Joe Biden getting into office would be the condition then for

22:21.180 --> 22:22.660
offensive violence, right?

22:22.660 --> 22:23.660
Yeah.

22:23.660 --> 22:24.660
That's the only thing that makes sense.

22:24.660 --> 22:25.660
That's the only way we can understand the sentence.

22:25.660 --> 22:26.660
Yeah.

22:26.660 --> 22:33.700
Him saying all of this is simply, I am not counseling actual violence until they're swearing

22:33.700 --> 22:34.940
him in, I guess.

22:34.940 --> 22:38.700
But once they swear him in, well, yeah, we got to blow it up because they're the most

22:38.700 --> 22:39.700
authoritarian.

22:39.700 --> 22:44.540
Or if you could do something that you could conceivably argue is going to stop him from

22:44.540 --> 22:45.540
being sworn in.

22:45.540 --> 22:46.540
Sure.

22:46.540 --> 22:47.540
Sure.

22:47.540 --> 22:48.540
Sure.

22:48.540 --> 22:50.080
Right on that line.

22:50.080 --> 22:53.100
Put a limousine in front of the gates to the White House.

22:53.100 --> 22:55.420
If he can't get in, buddy, guess what?

22:55.420 --> 22:56.420
Yeah.

22:56.420 --> 22:57.420
Never becomes president.

22:57.420 --> 22:58.420
Alex is doing well.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.420
Yeah.

22:59.420 --> 23:00.420
Yeah.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.420
I think so.

23:01.420 --> 23:02.420
Yeah.

23:02.420 --> 23:03.860
So Alex is just, it's bland.

23:03.860 --> 23:08.420
I would describe this show as flat.

23:08.420 --> 23:12.180
There's very little going on that even peaks my interest at all.

23:12.180 --> 23:13.700
It's just the hits.

23:13.700 --> 23:17.540
It's just kind of like him saying the same things and kind of hitting his bases.

23:17.540 --> 23:18.540
Sure.

23:18.540 --> 23:22.300
These are criminals that have brokered the shell out of America and they want to position

23:22.300 --> 23:28.500
the global government and they want to atomize the family and domesticate us so we can never

23:28.500 --> 23:34.820
rise again and never resist the nightmare future they've got for all of us.

23:34.820 --> 23:37.140
The chains are going on right now.

23:37.140 --> 23:38.460
You're being disenfranchised.

23:38.460 --> 23:39.460
All of us are.

23:39.460 --> 23:44.500
So we better work peacefully now so that war does not become inevitable.

23:44.500 --> 23:48.700
But we are now entering this season of war.

23:48.700 --> 23:51.020
Our country is at war for its very life.

23:51.020 --> 23:52.140
You are under attack.

23:52.140 --> 23:53.340
You are being conquered.

23:53.340 --> 23:54.340
You are being taken over.

23:54.340 --> 23:59.980
We are in the midst of a chai combat attempted takeover of the country and we're losing right

23:59.980 --> 24:00.980
now.

24:00.980 --> 24:04.580
I just can't feel anything here anymore.

24:04.580 --> 24:05.580
Yeah.

24:05.580 --> 24:09.700
Honestly personally, like I was thinking about it whenever we heard the first clip of him

24:09.700 --> 24:16.460
talking and then I realized that right now the only thing I'm interested in really is,

24:16.460 --> 24:17.660
is he going to take the plunge?

24:17.660 --> 24:19.180
You know, what is he going to do?

24:19.180 --> 24:20.180
What is he going to do?

24:20.180 --> 24:21.180
Yeah.

24:21.180 --> 24:24.220
He's going to take the leap or you're going to back off and if you back off, fuck you

24:24.220 --> 24:25.220
forever.

24:25.220 --> 24:27.060
And if you take the leap, all right, now let's see what's happening.

24:27.060 --> 24:28.060
And also fuck you.

24:28.060 --> 24:29.060
And also fuck you.

24:29.060 --> 24:30.060
Or do you pivot?

24:30.060 --> 24:32.300
Do you change your whole brand to God?

24:32.300 --> 24:33.300
Sure.

24:33.300 --> 24:34.300
Like do you do that?

24:34.300 --> 24:36.780
Do you become televangelist Alex or whatever?

24:36.780 --> 24:39.940
That seems to be the way to make way better money than what he's doing.

24:39.940 --> 24:45.740
And it seems like a place where he could play a lot more games about like state oppression.

24:45.740 --> 24:46.740
Yeah.

24:46.740 --> 24:47.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:47.740 --> 24:51.220
Like he could get Infowars into an actual church, you know?

24:51.220 --> 24:52.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:52.220 --> 24:58.060
If he pivoted to becoming Scientology and then like just made it his entire life's mission

24:58.060 --> 25:05.540
to be a nonprofit or for the government not to tax him, I can see that working.

25:05.540 --> 25:07.420
Yeah, that might be the next best thing.

25:07.420 --> 25:08.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:08.420 --> 25:10.100
So I agree with you.

25:10.100 --> 25:14.140
It's like, I'm not really interested in yelling about the Chinese.

25:14.140 --> 25:23.740
I really, you know, maybe it's just a momentary thing, but I'm a little bit bored by the like

25:23.740 --> 25:26.260
waffling around offensive violence.

25:26.260 --> 25:27.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:27.260 --> 25:28.860
It's just like, we know what you're doing.

25:28.860 --> 25:36.420
It's not really, I'm not interested in his going to Phoenix to yell into a bullhorn that

25:36.420 --> 25:37.420
much.

25:37.420 --> 25:38.420
I'm not that interested in it.

25:38.420 --> 25:39.420
I'm a little bit interested in it.

25:39.420 --> 25:41.900
I think the bullhorn was too big for me to be that interested in it.

25:41.900 --> 25:42.900
I agree.

25:42.900 --> 25:43.900
I agree.

25:43.900 --> 25:44.900
Yeah.

25:44.900 --> 25:51.820
I think somebody might've told him that the tiny bullhorn was a source of humor.

25:51.820 --> 25:58.860
I mean, you know, it's just a, yeah, the thing that is the most interesting is like, what

25:58.860 --> 25:59.860
are you going to do?

25:59.860 --> 26:00.860
Yeah.

26:00.860 --> 26:05.140
You have a problem and I want to see how you fix it or at least I want to see how you deal

26:05.140 --> 26:06.140
with it.

26:06.140 --> 26:08.320
Cause I don't think you're going to fix it.

26:08.320 --> 26:09.500
That's a probably a good note.

26:09.500 --> 26:10.500
Yeah.

26:10.500 --> 26:11.500
Good correction.

26:11.500 --> 26:12.500
Yeah.

26:12.500 --> 26:18.260
What we're seeing right now is what we see him do a lot at times when I think people

26:18.260 --> 26:23.340
could probably predict that there's going to be a possibility for some violence.

26:23.340 --> 26:28.940
I think any right thinking person, I'm not making any specific prediction or anything,

26:28.940 --> 26:37.980
but I do think that as we get closer to the inauguration, we do see probably an increased

26:37.980 --> 26:41.860
danger of some kind of right wing violence.

26:41.860 --> 26:46.420
I don't know that it's going to happen and it very well may not, but I think the odds

26:46.420 --> 26:53.220
of some kind of a thing happening maybe possible.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.700
I think Alex recognizes that.

26:54.700 --> 26:59.540
And so he goes out of his way to very consistently talk about how false flags are coming.

26:59.540 --> 27:00.540
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

27:00.540 --> 27:01.540
Well, I promise you this.

27:01.540 --> 27:09.060
I'm not giving up ever because I know the more I bend over, the worst stuff gets, and

27:09.060 --> 27:11.980
I will not sit here and be part of this.

27:11.980 --> 27:15.460
Now, that doesn't mean they blow something up and say, I did it.

27:15.460 --> 27:16.860
I'd never do that.

27:16.860 --> 27:19.380
Okay, cool.

27:19.380 --> 27:24.180
We see this all the time, and it's the times that I think that Alex is most keenly aware

27:24.180 --> 27:29.560
the people in his communities might blow something up, and I think that this is a good strategy

27:29.560 --> 27:35.260
for him to preemptively characterize anything as them false flagging in order to make us

27:35.260 --> 27:37.700
look bad, but it's incessant.

27:37.700 --> 27:40.900
He goes on this tip quite a bit.

27:40.900 --> 27:46.260
And the enemy's next phase will be to frame us as terrorists or evil, and they will stage

27:46.260 --> 27:51.840
terror attacks and blame it on us to then discredit any resistance.

27:51.840 --> 27:55.520
But we need to be ahead of that and understand that, and there are other forms of civil disobedience

27:55.520 --> 27:59.940
and things in the threat continuum of projection before we get to that point.

27:59.940 --> 28:07.220
But it is our right, it is our duty to resist this by every means necessary.

28:07.220 --> 28:10.100
And we are now at war for our very existence.

28:10.100 --> 28:13.140
America is on the edge of death.

28:13.140 --> 28:19.020
So if you understand that, kind of what he's saying is that the enemy is going to false

28:19.020 --> 28:23.060
flag themselves in order to make Alex and his friends look bad, and they've got to be

28:23.060 --> 28:24.060
careful about that.

28:24.060 --> 28:28.180
But also, I should tell you that there's something called the threat continuum projection, and

28:28.180 --> 28:32.100
then also we have the right to commit terror attacks if we want to.

28:32.100 --> 28:37.260
Yeah, I'm confused as to how it is you can play a game like this where it's like, hey,

28:37.260 --> 28:40.580
we would never do those terror attacks, it's a false flag.

28:40.580 --> 28:46.060
But whenever, if it does happen, then the people are going to be like, yeah, good job,

28:46.060 --> 28:48.500
we do terror attacks, we love terror attacks.

28:48.500 --> 28:51.340
Is everybody a false flagger on the far right?

28:51.340 --> 28:55.300
Is the entire far right, is all of the boogaloos a fucking false flag?

28:55.300 --> 28:56.560
I think Alex thinks that.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.560
That might be true.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.740
Yeah, he said that they were like a cutout group or something.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.420
Oh man.

29:02.420 --> 29:03.420
Was that last-

29:03.420 --> 29:04.420
I think he says that they're Antifa.

29:04.420 --> 29:09.100
Was Larry Nichols' last act to false flag us with the Proud Boys and the others?

29:09.100 --> 29:10.100
Oh no.

29:10.100 --> 29:11.100
Do you think so?

29:11.100 --> 29:12.100
Yeah, he did some witchcraft.

29:12.100 --> 29:13.100
I think he might have.

29:13.100 --> 29:17.900
Oh, speaking of which, I was going through, I was making that new drop, and so I was going

29:17.900 --> 29:22.900
through these old folders of episodes, and whenever I do that, I end up finding something

29:22.900 --> 29:25.220
that I had completely forgotten about.

29:25.220 --> 29:29.700
Did you remember that a year ago, Alex was saying that the Queen had joined the Patriots'

29:29.700 --> 29:30.700
side?

29:30.700 --> 29:31.700
Do you remember that?

29:31.700 --> 29:32.700
I do remember that!

29:32.700 --> 29:33.700
What the shit?

29:33.700 --> 29:34.700
That's right!

29:34.700 --> 29:35.700
Yeah.

29:35.700 --> 29:36.700
Oh, that's-

29:36.700 --> 29:41.660
I completely forgot, and there was like a two-day stretch where Alex thought that the

29:41.660 --> 29:45.660
Queen had succumbed to Donald Trump's side.

29:45.660 --> 29:47.980
Yeah, I think that's going to be something fun.

29:47.980 --> 29:53.140
If we ever do look back on these four years, like whenever it'll be funny again in 50,

29:53.140 --> 29:58.000
we'll look back and we'll be like, at one point in time, Alex said literally everyone

29:58.000 --> 30:02.980
he's hated before was a patriot, and also that he hates them later.

30:02.980 --> 30:04.180
It's everyone.

30:04.180 --> 30:05.180
It's everyone.

30:05.180 --> 30:07.060
The Queen has flipped her dictator switch.

30:07.060 --> 30:11.020
The Pope is evil, but the Pope likes it, and says, well, the Pope is good today.

30:11.020 --> 30:13.200
But someone who Alex would never speak ill of-

30:13.200 --> 30:14.200
Stephen Miller?

30:14.200 --> 30:16.500
Now, or 500 years from now, is his brother-in-law.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.780
I don't know who this dude is.

30:18.780 --> 30:24.140
But apparently his brother-in-law caught some election fraud.

30:24.140 --> 30:26.140
So we have-

30:26.140 --> 30:27.820
That's a good catch-fire.

30:27.820 --> 30:34.160
We have Alex's wife's tennis partner informing us about Antifa attacks, and Alex's brother-in-law

30:34.160 --> 30:35.940
coming in with some big scoops.

30:35.940 --> 30:36.940
So helpful.

30:36.940 --> 30:44.460
And then my own brother-in-law, who I've never seen get mad in the many years I've known

30:44.460 --> 30:50.700
him, calls up shaking yesterday, and I go, what's wrong?

30:50.700 --> 30:52.380
I just had 50 ballots.

30:52.380 --> 30:56.100
He's down here at Congress, post office.

30:56.100 --> 30:57.100
He had 50 of them.

30:57.100 --> 30:58.100
He was filling them out as a name.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.100
They were taking them.

30:59.100 --> 31:00.100
They didn't do anything.

31:00.100 --> 31:01.100
I said, why don't you videotape it?

31:01.100 --> 31:02.100
Well, I'm in the post office.

31:02.100 --> 31:03.100
It's a federal thing if you do that.

31:03.100 --> 31:04.100
He just knows the law.

31:04.100 --> 31:05.100
But let me see.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.100
He followed the law.

31:06.100 --> 31:07.100
They don't.

31:07.100 --> 31:08.100
And he was shaking with anger.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.100
I said, come on the air.

31:09.100 --> 31:10.100
And he goes, well, I don't really want to do that.

31:10.100 --> 31:11.100
I don't want to be on TV.

31:11.100 --> 31:13.420
But I said, cut an audio piece.

31:13.420 --> 31:14.420
Send me a voice memo.

31:14.420 --> 31:15.420
He did.

31:15.420 --> 31:16.420
We'll play it next time.

31:16.420 --> 31:21.620
Don't you dare fucking give me a goddamn break.

31:21.620 --> 31:23.420
It's against the law.

31:23.420 --> 31:25.420
Yeah, I found globalists committing.

31:25.420 --> 31:28.420
I saw Mass Motor Front and I was like, I follow the law.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.820
I will not videotape his crime.

31:30.820 --> 31:36.740
I would never, as a far right person, I would never videotape a crime.

31:36.740 --> 31:39.740
Here's this thing that my brother-in-law yells about all the time.

31:39.740 --> 31:42.700
I have proof that can make him look not crazy.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.700
Oh, no.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.700
I can't pull out my phone.

31:46.700 --> 31:50.020
Don't you think there's a, if that really happened, there's a moment in his head where

31:50.020 --> 31:52.500
he's like, nooo.

31:52.500 --> 31:57.980
Well, here is his testimony because he did record an audio and it's meaningless.

31:57.980 --> 32:03.700
I went to the post office today to drop off some packages with some products and there's

32:03.700 --> 32:08.740
this guy there, real sketchy looking, and he had a grocery bag filled up with about

32:08.740 --> 32:11.200
50 million ballots.

32:11.200 --> 32:15.020
And he was taking pictures of them, taking pictures of himself and filling them out right

32:15.020 --> 32:16.820
there on the counter.

32:16.820 --> 32:21.140
And I could only see the ballot that he had in front of him on the counter and the one

32:21.140 --> 32:22.660
on the top of the bag.

32:22.660 --> 32:25.660
But they had the same signatures, same information on him.

32:25.660 --> 32:31.940
And he was just taking pictures, doing one last check, marking some things and then putting

32:31.940 --> 32:36.060
them straight in the ballot box right in front of everyone, right on the counter.

32:36.060 --> 32:37.660
And no one did anything.

32:37.660 --> 32:41.060
And I was thinking about doing something, but all I could think about was, you know,

32:41.060 --> 32:46.980
me getting some kind of federal charge for interfering with the election with this guy,

32:46.980 --> 32:48.660
putting in, you know, 50 ballots.

32:48.660 --> 32:53.260
That is what you would be doing late, because I don't think they're supposed to accept them

32:53.260 --> 32:54.260
now.

32:54.260 --> 32:57.500
But I mean, if you have a lot of these people doing that, it's going to add up.

32:57.500 --> 33:03.540
And the only reason you would do it is to try to overturn what the state has already

33:03.540 --> 33:05.220
decided and Texas is red.

33:05.220 --> 33:10.180
So one can only assume that these votes, all 50 of them are going to Joe Biden.

33:10.180 --> 33:20.980
Ah, ah, ah, this, this guy shows, wow, I mean, he's the brother-in-law, so he's not related

33:20.980 --> 33:21.980
by blood.

33:21.980 --> 33:26.740
No, but there's something about being close to the Jones family that just makes you good

33:26.740 --> 33:29.020
at figuring things out.

33:29.020 --> 33:31.020
Good at investigating.

33:31.020 --> 33:35.180
There's like something in their, in their family and their extended family that makes

33:35.180 --> 33:39.460
them not jump to conclusions about stuff and really just get to the bottom of it.

33:39.460 --> 33:40.460
I admire that.

33:40.460 --> 33:43.980
If you need somebody to help you fill out your ballot, does that person also need to

33:43.980 --> 33:45.060
sign the ballot?

33:45.060 --> 33:46.060
They do.

33:46.060 --> 33:47.060
Yeah.

33:47.060 --> 33:48.740
I mean, this person could have been like a proxy or something.

33:48.740 --> 33:50.580
Could have just gone to a nursing home.

33:50.580 --> 33:51.580
Yeah.

33:51.580 --> 33:52.580
That is a possibility.

33:52.580 --> 33:57.340
Or I mean, if he's saying that this is like after election day, they might not have been

33:57.340 --> 33:58.340
balanced.

33:58.340 --> 33:59.340
They could just be anything.

33:59.340 --> 34:01.220
I don't trust this guy's instincts.

34:01.220 --> 34:02.220
Absolutely not.

34:02.220 --> 34:04.100
I have no idea what he did or didn't see.

34:04.100 --> 34:06.140
I don't even know if he's Alex's brother-in-law.

34:06.140 --> 34:07.140
Quick question.

34:07.140 --> 34:08.580
Did he mail in his ballot?

34:08.580 --> 34:10.300
I doubt it.

34:10.300 --> 34:13.740
Does he know what a mail in ballot would look like?

34:13.740 --> 34:14.860
No idea.

34:14.860 --> 34:16.200
I don't trust any of this.

34:16.200 --> 34:20.180
And I love the part at the end there is like, the only reason you do this is to try and

34:20.180 --> 34:21.500
change things.

34:21.500 --> 34:22.720
And Texas went red.

34:22.720 --> 34:27.620
So therefore all of these votes, all these votes that I have just decided are 50.

34:27.620 --> 34:28.620
I didn't count them.

34:28.620 --> 34:30.320
I have no fucking idea.

34:30.320 --> 34:32.460
They must all be for, what if they're all for Trump?

34:32.460 --> 34:33.460
Dumb, dumb.

34:33.460 --> 34:35.460
You can't prove anything.

34:35.460 --> 34:42.060
Furthermore, uh, Texas has already got, I suppose they hadn't called the other states

34:42.060 --> 34:43.060
by this time.

34:43.060 --> 34:44.060
Okay.

34:44.060 --> 34:45.060
That's fair.

34:45.060 --> 34:52.380
Alex tries to make sense of this, that they're being sent from Texas to other states.

34:52.380 --> 34:54.780
You guys got to work on this.

34:54.780 --> 34:56.860
If that's the case, I mean, it's 50 votes.

34:56.860 --> 34:59.420
I don't know what kind of, I don't know.

34:59.420 --> 35:00.420
I think this is stupid.

35:00.420 --> 35:03.300
Trump won Texas by a million.

35:03.300 --> 35:06.460
Anyway, Alex thinks that there's only one solution.

35:06.460 --> 35:08.140
I think we just call for a new election.

35:08.140 --> 35:09.140
Fair enough.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.620
Uh, so he wants a new election.

35:10.620 --> 35:16.340
I can't think of anything everyone in the United States agrees is the worst idea that

35:16.340 --> 35:17.700
anyone could ever do.

35:17.700 --> 35:18.700
Run it again.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.900
More than let's do it again.

35:20.900 --> 35:22.720
The most stressful time.

35:22.720 --> 35:26.420
It doesn't matter what team you're on.

35:26.420 --> 35:27.420
Don't do it again.

35:27.420 --> 35:29.380
Well, just anything but that.

35:29.380 --> 35:31.080
Okay, fine, fine.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.980
Let's not do another election.

35:32.980 --> 35:35.500
But how about we nullify this one?

35:35.500 --> 35:36.500
Okay.

35:36.500 --> 35:37.500
But then we'll have to do it.

35:37.500 --> 35:42.900
I'm playing all the clips when we come back, but I'm going to say this right now.

35:42.900 --> 35:45.960
Whatever happens with Trump, he's done the right thing fighting this, but he didn't fight

35:45.960 --> 35:48.020
the censorship like he should have.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.740
But we're in the bed we're in now.

35:49.740 --> 35:51.860
We're going to have to sleep in it.

35:51.860 --> 35:55.340
But if we get the point out that it's a chai con globalist takeover and it's the end of

35:55.340 --> 35:59.780
the country as we know it, and that it's illegal, not just that they're stealing the election,

35:59.780 --> 36:03.540
but when you have Chinese and foreign backing, it nullifies what's happened.

36:03.540 --> 36:08.260
And if we stand on that and say, oh, does it try to nullify Trump saying he was a Russian

36:08.260 --> 36:09.660
with no proof?

36:09.660 --> 36:12.540
We're going to nullify Biden a hundred percent.

36:12.540 --> 36:16.580
We're going to demand Mitch McConnell and all of them do it and not have a fake investigation

36:16.580 --> 36:21.000
because we've got him red handed being a chai con agent.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.300
And that's what's so dangerous.

36:22.300 --> 36:23.820
That's super constitutional.

36:23.820 --> 36:27.740
Oh man, we're going to nullify his election and I'm going to have Mitch McConnell do it

36:27.740 --> 36:31.300
without a trial because he's a red handed.

36:31.300 --> 36:34.380
You know, if you're caught red handed, you still go to trial.

36:34.380 --> 36:35.860
No, no, no, no, no.

36:35.860 --> 36:39.960
It's like in the old west, if you get caught killing somebody, they just hang you right

36:39.960 --> 36:40.960
then and there.

36:40.960 --> 36:41.960
It's that simple.

36:41.960 --> 36:45.540
If you get caught in the act, you're still called an alleged killer.

36:45.540 --> 36:47.020
Nope, Nope.

36:47.020 --> 36:48.500
Unless you're a far right murderer.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.660
In which case, well, of course you didn't even actually do it.

36:50.660 --> 36:51.660
Here's a false flag.

36:51.660 --> 36:54.860
Um, so yeah, I guess Alex wants to know this.

36:54.860 --> 36:55.860
This isn't going to work.

36:55.860 --> 36:56.860
I don't think so.

36:56.860 --> 36:57.860
I don't think so.

36:57.860 --> 37:04.180
Now, one thing that I thought was really strange was this is like all, like I said, flat, feels

37:04.180 --> 37:05.180
like nothing.

37:05.180 --> 37:10.820
Um, and then Alex has a guest on and this guest, I don't know what the fuck he was doing.

37:10.820 --> 37:17.620
So this person is named Amanda Milius and she is the daughter of John Milius.

37:17.620 --> 37:22.100
He's the director of Conan the Barbarian, Apocalypse Now, and of course Red Dawn, Alex's

37:22.100 --> 37:24.260
favorite documentary, Red Dawn.

37:24.260 --> 37:27.180
He was the director of Apocalypse Now?

37:27.180 --> 37:28.180
Or maybe producer.

37:28.180 --> 37:29.180
I'm not sure.

37:29.180 --> 37:30.180
He was involved in Apocalypse Now.

37:30.180 --> 37:31.180
Okay.

37:31.180 --> 37:35.060
I was going to say, because there's a pretty famous guy who directed Apocalypse Now that

37:35.060 --> 37:37.060
wasn't that guy.

37:37.060 --> 37:40.940
If you researched into it and it turns out that it wasn't him at all, then we've got

37:40.940 --> 37:41.940
a whole story.

37:41.940 --> 37:43.300
He might not have directed any of those.

37:43.300 --> 37:47.140
He might have produced them or wrote them or something, screenplay.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.140
He's involved.

37:48.140 --> 37:49.140
He's in the mix.

37:49.140 --> 37:50.140
He's involved.

37:50.140 --> 37:51.140
Whatever.

37:51.140 --> 37:58.040
So Amanda, she's become a Trump propagandist and she just released a film called The Plot

37:58.040 --> 37:59.700
Against the President.

37:59.700 --> 38:04.460
And so she is in, and she has some interesting things to talk about.

38:04.460 --> 38:05.500
I love the smell of...

38:05.500 --> 38:08.860
You were a huge part of why I left Hollywood.

38:08.860 --> 38:14.580
I was listening to Info Wars all the time and I left and I volunteered in 2016 in Nevada,

38:14.580 --> 38:18.060
which by the way, Nevada is a huge battleground for us right now.

38:18.060 --> 38:20.460
Nevada is where everything's happening.

38:20.460 --> 38:24.580
And I ended up leaving Hollywood completely and joining the Trump administration, working

38:24.580 --> 38:25.580
at the State Department.

38:25.580 --> 38:28.120
How proud is your family of you?

38:28.120 --> 38:29.120
They're pretty happy.

38:29.120 --> 38:30.620
You were already being successful in Hollywood.

38:30.620 --> 38:34.220
I admire the fact that you cut bait with those guys.

38:34.220 --> 38:38.340
Not to be a dick, but Amanda Milius is not somebody who you would say walked away from

38:38.340 --> 38:40.640
a vibrant career in Hollywood.

38:40.640 --> 38:44.700
If you check out her IMDb page, she has two primary credits as a director, one being this

38:44.700 --> 38:49.540
new Trump film and the other one a 2015 short called The Lotus Gun.

38:49.540 --> 38:54.580
Her only credits as a performer are as herself in a documentary about her dad and appearances

38:54.580 --> 39:00.860
on Tucker Carlson and Sebastian Gorka's shows, most likely promoting Trump and her new propaganda

39:00.860 --> 39:01.860
film.

39:01.860 --> 39:02.860
That would make sense.

39:02.860 --> 39:05.500
It's all good to do this interview and be like, hey, look at this famous, you know,

39:05.500 --> 39:09.140
movie person's daughter who likes Trump, but it's entirely another thing to pretend that

39:09.140 --> 39:14.020
she was like an A or B or even C list person and then walked away from it to get on board

39:14.020 --> 39:15.020
with Trump.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.820
That's insulting to her and to us as listeners.

39:17.820 --> 39:19.460
Look at this important movie person.

39:19.460 --> 39:24.260
Of course, his daughter, independent of his success, has also become a massive success

39:24.260 --> 39:25.380
in the film industry.

39:25.380 --> 39:26.380
What was that?

39:26.380 --> 39:27.380
No.

39:27.380 --> 39:28.380
Oh shit.

39:28.380 --> 39:29.380
Yeah.

39:29.380 --> 39:30.380
And you heard her.

39:30.380 --> 39:31.380
She said she worked in the State Department.

39:31.380 --> 39:32.380
Yeah.

39:32.380 --> 39:33.380
She apparently was involved in Trump's State Department.

39:33.380 --> 39:35.060
She had some kind of a role in that.

39:35.060 --> 39:40.660
And so there is a feeling of her being here almost in an official capacity and the fact

39:40.660 --> 39:45.860
that she made this Trump propaganda film that you just released while she had been working

39:45.860 --> 39:51.000
at the State Department is just a, just a bizarre, um, it seems inappropriate.

39:51.000 --> 39:56.740
I don't think someone with less than my resume should work at the State Department.

39:56.740 --> 39:58.780
And I don't think I should work at the State Department, Dan.

39:58.780 --> 40:02.540
I don't, I don't know what was going on, but everything felt wrong about this.

40:02.540 --> 40:03.540
Yeah.

40:03.540 --> 40:06.020
And then it got even worse because we introduced another weirdo into the mix.

40:06.020 --> 40:07.020
All right.

40:07.020 --> 40:08.020
So you can introduce you better than I can.

40:08.020 --> 40:09.340
I love Ali Alexander.

40:09.340 --> 40:13.180
He's been on fire a long time, but you were talking about how you just suddenly brought

40:13.180 --> 40:16.380
all this together and reached out as a catalyst.

40:16.380 --> 40:18.380
He months ago was saying, stop the still getting it ready.

40:18.380 --> 40:20.400
But he is an example to others.

40:20.400 --> 40:24.360
He just reached out, got a bunch of key people together and now this is a super viral movement.

40:24.360 --> 40:29.460
So Ali Alexander is this, uh, you know, the zealot weirdo who's been coming on Alex's

40:29.460 --> 40:31.240
show a bit lately.

40:31.240 --> 40:35.300
And now he's involved in something called stop the steal, which is, you know, they're

40:35.300 --> 40:39.580
doing the, you know, I don't know, it's maybe the catchphrase of a lot of these totally

40:39.580 --> 40:44.740
not astroturfed, uh, 100% grassroots.

40:44.740 --> 40:45.740
I don't care.

40:45.740 --> 40:46.740
Whatever.

40:46.740 --> 40:47.740
Yeah.

40:47.740 --> 40:50.740
I'm more interested in the fact that I only remember this because we just talked about

40:50.740 --> 40:51.740
it.

40:51.740 --> 40:55.820
Stop the steal was the name of the thing that Roger Stone was involved in in 2016.

40:55.820 --> 40:56.980
Yeah, exactly.

40:56.980 --> 41:02.700
Jesus Christ, that was Roger Stone's whole thing that he got sued about.

41:02.700 --> 41:09.540
Oh man, 2016 is the year all their evil tricks worked in 2020 is the year they almost worked.

41:09.540 --> 41:13.180
Like that's, but everybody found them far more disappointing and sad this time.

41:13.180 --> 41:14.780
But it's also super weird.

41:14.780 --> 41:16.020
Like it's the same name.

41:16.020 --> 41:17.020
It's the same name.

41:17.020 --> 41:18.020
Why?

41:18.020 --> 41:21.020
What are you going to copyright it for your, for your protest movement?

41:21.020 --> 41:22.420
It seems very strange to me.

41:22.420 --> 41:26.920
It makes me wonder if Roger is somehow involved, but I have no idea.

41:26.920 --> 41:27.920
He is nowhere to be found.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.060
Does Roger still have the email address?

41:30.060 --> 41:32.940
Stop the steal at Gmail?

41:32.940 --> 41:33.940
At Yahoo?

41:33.940 --> 41:34.940
Yeah, probably.

41:34.940 --> 41:41.060
Um, so Ali wants sort of the same thing Alex wants, which is a new election, but only in

41:41.060 --> 41:42.660
the States that Trump lost.

41:42.660 --> 41:43.660
What?

41:43.660 --> 41:47.580
Well, because there can't be a recount, you know?

41:47.580 --> 41:51.160
Unfortunately even winning, uh, Nevada wouldn't put us over the top.

41:51.160 --> 41:54.300
That puts us at two 65 or two 66.

41:54.300 --> 41:57.860
We have to win Pennsylvania and look, I know it's not popular.

41:57.860 --> 42:01.820
The Republican party doesn't want me to say this, but we need a revote in Wisconsin and

42:01.820 --> 42:03.580
we need a revote in Michigan.

42:03.580 --> 42:07.940
The fraud is so wrought there and we are going to get a recount in, in Wisconsin, but here's

42:07.940 --> 42:08.940
what I'm afraid of.

42:08.940 --> 42:09.940
Alex.

42:09.940 --> 42:17.420
I think the Democrats have baited us into a rigged recount on recount trap guys, classic

42:17.420 --> 42:19.000
recount guys.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.940
You just lost it.

42:20.940 --> 42:24.680
We didn't bait you into a recount trap.

42:24.680 --> 42:26.420
No one wants a recount.

42:26.420 --> 42:27.420
It's a classic recap.

42:27.420 --> 42:28.420
That's not even a thing.

42:28.420 --> 42:29.420
That's not even a thing.

42:29.420 --> 42:32.540
That's a recount trap.

42:32.540 --> 42:33.540
It's a set up.

42:33.540 --> 42:36.300
When was the last recount trap that happened?

42:36.300 --> 42:40.220
Every election since Hoover.

42:40.220 --> 42:44.020
This is what he thinks the Democrats big prestige is at the end of the film.

42:44.020 --> 42:45.220
They're like, ha ha.

42:45.220 --> 42:48.000
And we wanted you to do the recount the whole time.

42:48.000 --> 42:54.940
We won the state and we want you to force a recap so we can also win again more so we

42:54.940 --> 42:56.580
can win more this time.

42:56.580 --> 42:58.100
Cool, Ali.

42:58.100 --> 43:00.980
Can't imagine why the Republican party doesn't want you talking for him.

43:00.980 --> 43:01.980
Strange.

43:01.980 --> 43:06.100
Yeah, he believes Ali believes that Trump's just got to seize power.

43:06.100 --> 43:10.900
Well, we certainly need to use the full weight of the federal government.

43:10.900 --> 43:15.280
And and what we got to do is we the people have to say you have a mandate to do that.

43:15.280 --> 43:19.360
President Trump got more votes than any candidate in American history.

43:19.360 --> 43:21.340
The idea just just visualize this.

43:21.340 --> 43:26.180
Go to your child and ask him, do you think that Joe Biden would be the top vote getter

43:26.180 --> 43:27.820
in American history?

43:27.820 --> 43:30.100
No, nobody believes that.

43:30.100 --> 43:31.400
And so we know that it's rigged.

43:31.400 --> 43:35.900
They just had a plus one system rigged in every Republican ballot that came in.

43:35.900 --> 43:37.540
They found a dead person.

43:37.540 --> 43:39.460
They found a covid ballot.

43:39.460 --> 43:43.340
Somebody did a mail in ballot and then voted in on Election Day, too.

43:43.340 --> 43:44.340
They rigged the election.

43:44.340 --> 43:47.660
There's no body who's going to believe that Joe Biden is the most popular politician in

43:47.660 --> 43:48.660
American history.

43:48.660 --> 43:49.700
I agree with you.

43:49.700 --> 43:51.900
One from you, two for me.

43:51.900 --> 43:53.660
So, so did.

43:53.660 --> 43:54.660
So excuse me.

43:54.660 --> 44:01.540
We just did we win by what, 66 percent of the popular vote must have.

44:01.540 --> 44:03.700
Yeah, this is dumb.

44:03.700 --> 44:08.940
I would say don't ask your child this question and then assume anything, because, you know

44:08.940 --> 44:10.620
what, a lot of trivia is surprising.

44:10.620 --> 44:11.620
Yeah, yeah.

44:11.620 --> 44:13.860
And sometimes you'll be surprised by facts.

44:13.860 --> 44:19.140
Ask like a six year old with no prior actual experience and really no understanding of

44:19.140 --> 44:22.700
the American system at all, whether or not Biden would be the most popular candidate

44:22.700 --> 44:23.700
in history.

44:23.700 --> 44:28.100
I guarantee that no one would think that in a bubble, Biden would get the most votes of

44:28.100 --> 44:29.100
anybody ever.

44:29.100 --> 44:34.180
But I think given the circumstances, yes, if you look at the context, it makes a little

44:34.180 --> 44:35.180
more sense.

44:35.180 --> 44:40.620
And if you consider like how a lot of that is voting against Trump, it makes sense.

44:40.620 --> 44:41.620
Yeah.

44:41.620 --> 44:42.620
Yeah.

44:42.620 --> 44:43.620
Yeah.

44:43.620 --> 44:47.140
But so Ali is like, yeah, Trump had to have won because you can't imagine even a child

44:47.140 --> 44:49.940
couldn't imagine that someone likes Biden more.

44:49.940 --> 44:50.940
Yeah.

44:50.940 --> 44:51.940
That's not good thinking.

44:51.940 --> 44:53.580
Oh, no, that's that's real bad.

44:53.580 --> 44:54.580
This guy sucks.

44:54.580 --> 44:56.220
And he leaves.

44:56.220 --> 45:02.020
And Amanda and Alex start talking about, like, what happened with Drudge, man?

45:02.020 --> 45:03.820
Drudge is Drudge is gone.

45:03.820 --> 45:04.820
Oh, guys.

45:04.820 --> 45:06.140
He doesn't like us anymore.

45:06.140 --> 45:07.140
Guys.

45:07.140 --> 45:09.320
What happened to Drudge?

45:09.320 --> 45:12.700
You tell me, you know, everybody thinks he was kidnapped and there's somebody else in

45:12.700 --> 45:14.420
place because this is very bizarre.

45:14.420 --> 45:15.420
His behavior this year.

45:15.420 --> 45:16.420
It's very weird.

45:16.420 --> 45:18.180
It's not helpful is what it is.

45:18.180 --> 45:21.060
But whatever his game is, I'm not super into it.

45:21.060 --> 45:22.060
But but anyway.

45:22.060 --> 45:23.060
But yeah.

45:23.060 --> 45:24.060
I'm not into it either.

45:24.060 --> 45:25.460
I mean, was he blackmailed?

45:25.460 --> 45:26.460
Was he kidnapped?

45:26.460 --> 45:28.340
I mean, they're willing to do anything.

45:28.340 --> 45:30.700
No, I think.

45:30.700 --> 45:31.700
He was at the White House.

45:31.700 --> 45:32.700
Somebody didn't listen to him.

45:32.700 --> 45:33.700
He saw some betrayals.

45:33.700 --> 45:34.700
He got really pissed.

45:34.700 --> 45:37.260
They weren't standing up against censorship.

45:37.260 --> 45:44.740
And Steve Bannon through the grapevine told me that CNN leased it and that CNN.

45:44.740 --> 45:45.740
That's what it seems like.

45:45.740 --> 45:46.740
CNN leased it.

45:46.740 --> 45:51.700
But then I was like, OK, I was like, I don't believe Steve Bannon because what Roger Stone

45:51.700 --> 45:52.700
said.

45:52.700 --> 45:54.140
I think Steve overall is a good guy.

45:54.140 --> 45:55.140
I don't want to be mad at him.

45:55.140 --> 45:56.140
I don't want to have fights with people.

45:56.140 --> 45:57.140
I'm not trying to be a Washington guy.

45:57.140 --> 45:58.140
I don't care.

45:58.140 --> 45:59.140
I don't get in the middle of it.

45:59.140 --> 46:04.420
But then I look at CNN and then I look at Drudge and it's it's their flavor.

46:04.420 --> 46:05.420
It's their signature.

46:05.420 --> 46:06.420
It is.

46:06.420 --> 46:07.420
It is.

46:07.420 --> 46:08.420
It matches very, very well.

46:08.420 --> 46:09.420
Yeah.

46:09.420 --> 46:10.420
Drudge Report's now CNN.

46:10.420 --> 46:11.420
Yeah.

46:11.420 --> 46:12.420
Drudge Report's now CNN.

46:12.420 --> 46:13.420
They're leasing it.

46:13.420 --> 46:14.420
Man.

46:14.420 --> 46:20.260
When we go back to the stakes where it's like he's saying nonsense like Drudge Report is

46:20.260 --> 46:23.620
leasing, Drudge is leasing the Drudge Report to CNN.

46:23.620 --> 46:24.620
Yeah.

46:24.620 --> 46:26.180
But what's the contract like?

46:26.180 --> 46:31.180
What's the seriously clandestine contract to because you can't release an option to

46:31.180 --> 46:32.180
extend?

46:32.180 --> 46:33.180
No point.

46:33.180 --> 46:34.180
Yeah.

46:34.180 --> 46:35.180
Is it hard?

46:35.180 --> 46:39.920
Look, does everybody get to share or is it like the Super Bowl thing where you can only

46:39.920 --> 46:41.720
buy ads at a certain time?

46:41.720 --> 46:43.180
Let's pretend this means anything.

46:43.180 --> 46:44.180
OK.

46:44.180 --> 46:49.820
If this does mean something, then imagine that the hero of your media sphere, the guy

46:49.820 --> 46:55.420
who has directed the course of conservative talk radio for the last like 20 years since

46:55.420 --> 46:59.460
the Clinton days, the guy who can make or break people.

46:59.460 --> 47:00.460
One hundred percent.

47:00.460 --> 47:04.700
The guy who brought us Andrew Breitbart and therefore brought us Breitbart, brought us

47:04.700 --> 47:05.700
James O'Keefe.

47:05.700 --> 47:06.700
You got it.

47:06.700 --> 47:09.140
The guy who's like responsible for so many shitheads.

47:09.140 --> 47:10.140
Yeah.

47:10.140 --> 47:13.180
He's also someone whose site you can lease.

47:13.180 --> 47:17.780
See, but that's something that I think they would buy.

47:17.780 --> 47:19.860
Well, that would be like I'm a grifter.

47:19.860 --> 47:20.860
He's a grifter.

47:20.860 --> 47:23.460
But that would kind of implies that he's had a lease prior.

47:23.460 --> 47:24.460
Yeah.

47:24.460 --> 47:26.660
Who is he leased out to prior?

47:26.660 --> 47:29.060
Who is he working for?

47:29.060 --> 47:31.300
Murdoch can't afford his prices anymore.

47:31.300 --> 47:32.520
Now it's just CNN.

47:32.520 --> 47:33.520
Is that the implication?

47:33.520 --> 47:34.820
I think that might be the implication.

47:34.820 --> 47:39.540
Wrestle with that, Alex, because I think Alex actually kind of touched on what probably

47:39.540 --> 47:44.980
could be a reasonable explanation, and that is that Drudge got led in a little bit, saw

47:44.980 --> 47:50.420
the disorder, saw the quote unquote betrayals, recognized that Trump wasn't taking the issues

47:50.420 --> 47:54.900
of like online censorship seriously, which is something that he would be super interested

47:54.900 --> 47:58.420
in given his brand and his entire market space.

47:58.420 --> 47:59.420
You would think.

47:59.420 --> 48:04.460
And so he followed his principle, which is I can't support this anymore or whatever.

48:04.460 --> 48:06.940
I mean, the guy wants to get rid of 230.

48:06.940 --> 48:13.580
I aggregate conservative media, so I am fucked if they do that.

48:13.580 --> 48:14.580
Yeah.

48:14.580 --> 48:16.060
I'm a single issue voter.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.060
Yeah.

48:17.060 --> 48:18.060
Yeah.

48:18.060 --> 48:20.060
And your guy is going to kill my business.

48:20.060 --> 48:21.060
Exactly.

48:21.060 --> 48:22.060
Yeah.

48:22.060 --> 48:23.060
Yeah.

48:23.060 --> 48:26.420
And so I think that Alex kind of recognized, he kind of gave up the game that he understands

48:26.420 --> 48:27.740
actually what's going on.

48:27.740 --> 48:28.740
Yeah.

48:28.740 --> 48:31.900
But you've got to play some fun thing with like he's getting leased out by CNN or he's

48:31.900 --> 48:34.900
kidnapped or blackmailed or whatever.

48:34.900 --> 48:36.300
Have a fun time with that.

48:36.300 --> 48:38.180
No, whatever, dudes.

48:38.180 --> 48:44.180
So there's another question, not only what's up with Matt Drudge, what's up with Trump?

48:44.180 --> 48:45.180
Where's he been?

48:45.180 --> 48:49.060
Let me ask you this question, because you are an insider for the Patriot movement.

48:49.060 --> 48:54.300
I was flipping out the day after the election saying, OK, he gave a three a.m. speech.

48:54.300 --> 48:55.600
It was amazing.

48:55.600 --> 49:01.220
I want to see him Oval Office addressing every fraud, fireside chat, graphs showing it, you

49:01.220 --> 49:02.220
know, Gateway pun.

49:02.220 --> 49:05.020
And I think some of the best job overall analysis and force on video the best.

49:05.020 --> 49:06.020
But I don't care.

49:06.020 --> 49:07.020
I just want to win.

49:07.020 --> 49:08.700
He should be up there showing it.

49:08.700 --> 49:11.240
But then he's been dead silent for a day and a half.

49:11.240 --> 49:13.860
And then talking to the crew, they all separately.

49:13.860 --> 49:14.860
I went to different offices.

49:14.860 --> 49:18.540
I respect people's actual view, I say, because I was missing.

49:18.540 --> 49:19.540
I'm like, where is he?

49:19.540 --> 49:20.540
He needs to be up front attacking.

49:20.540 --> 49:21.540
Yeah, they go.

49:21.540 --> 49:24.880
He's waiting for the people to mobilize and he's going to see what we do.

49:24.880 --> 49:25.880
It's now up to us.

49:25.880 --> 49:27.580
And I think that clicked.

49:27.580 --> 49:29.100
Is that an accurate statement?

49:29.100 --> 49:33.380
That is a great leader.

49:33.380 --> 49:40.360
As our fearless leader, he has decided to allow us to choose what he will do based upon

49:40.360 --> 49:43.540
our disorganized actions.

49:43.540 --> 49:45.740
I've concocted a way to look at this.

49:45.740 --> 49:49.260
So if shit goes bad, it's kind of our fault.

49:49.260 --> 49:55.940
Trump put the ball in our court and we just didn't storm the buildings or something.

49:55.940 --> 49:56.940
Trump is a genius.

49:56.940 --> 49:59.700
He's just saying, hey, people, you do whatever you to do.

49:59.700 --> 50:00.700
What a leader.

50:00.700 --> 50:01.700
It is.

50:01.700 --> 50:02.700
It is.

50:02.700 --> 50:03.700
You know what?

50:03.700 --> 50:10.560
I'm almost I'm almost like, God damn it, America can't even get a good dictate, a good dictator.

50:10.560 --> 50:11.780
Like we're just shitty people.

50:11.780 --> 50:14.260
We're just shitty people who got a shitty dictator.

50:14.260 --> 50:19.740
Other places know how to get a fucking dictator, you know, like Russia's had 30 dictators.

50:19.740 --> 50:21.140
They know what they're doing.

50:21.140 --> 50:23.860
It's it's it's a little strange.

50:23.860 --> 50:30.220
The the the sort of the position that Alex has put in is like he's he's he's presented

50:30.220 --> 50:34.140
this guy is like strong, competent and a good leader.

50:34.140 --> 50:41.700
And now in a position where like the everything is pretty uncertain, things are tense.

50:41.700 --> 50:44.500
There's election counting going on.

50:44.500 --> 50:45.500
Trump's nowhere to be found.

50:45.500 --> 50:48.020
No, he's not assuming a leadership position.

50:48.020 --> 50:49.520
Oh, that's right.

50:49.520 --> 50:51.020
The thing he's supposed to do.

50:51.020 --> 50:52.020
Yeah.

50:52.020 --> 50:53.020
Yeah.

50:53.020 --> 50:55.820
And you can do that without asserting power or claiming you won the election.

50:55.820 --> 50:59.460
You can still be visible and say, you know, this is going along.

50:59.460 --> 51:00.520
The process is moving.

51:00.520 --> 51:01.860
We support the vote counters.

51:01.860 --> 51:02.860
Totally.

51:02.860 --> 51:07.260
You know, there is a way to do that and still give the appearance that someone's here, someone's

51:07.260 --> 51:08.260
in charge.

51:08.260 --> 51:11.860
And instead, no, Alex even recognizes, I don't fucking know.

51:11.860 --> 51:14.260
I don't know if I've seen Trump since election night.

51:14.260 --> 51:15.260
Yeah.

51:15.260 --> 51:16.580
And no one knows what to do.

51:16.580 --> 51:20.460
And if you look at all of the people on the like, this is maybe another thing that we

51:20.460 --> 51:24.700
got lucky with because Trump's such an actually shitty leader.

51:24.700 --> 51:29.260
Everybody went apeshit in their own little pockets, like throughout all of election night.

51:29.260 --> 51:32.900
And as the votes have come in and they they declared it for Biden, you see more of those

51:32.900 --> 51:36.660
little pockets of everybody frantically discussing with all their friends.

51:36.660 --> 51:39.660
But there's no unified, yeah, we're going to do this.

51:39.660 --> 51:40.660
It's everybody separate.

51:40.660 --> 51:42.500
Like, I don't know what to do.

51:42.500 --> 51:43.860
Q hasn't said anything.

51:43.860 --> 51:44.860
I don't know what to do.

51:44.860 --> 51:45.860
I don't know what to do.

51:45.860 --> 51:46.860
You don't say anything.

51:46.860 --> 51:47.860
I don't know.

51:47.860 --> 51:48.860
We have no leaders.

51:48.860 --> 51:49.860
Yeah.

51:49.860 --> 51:54.140
And actually, that leads us to our next clip, because there's a phenomenon that Amanda discusses

51:54.140 --> 51:55.760
that I think is really interesting.

51:55.760 --> 51:56.760
Power vacuum.

51:56.760 --> 52:01.300
Cernovich got to Arizona in like, what, like a couple hours?

52:01.300 --> 52:02.980
Like he was like, I'm there, I'm going.

52:02.980 --> 52:04.980
And he gathered all those people and did it.

52:04.980 --> 52:08.980
I mean, that's what's happening right now is everybody's putting aside any kind of,

52:08.980 --> 52:12.140
you know, critiques of the administration or whatever's happening.

52:12.140 --> 52:15.940
And they're just they're just jumping in, because this moment is everything.

52:15.940 --> 52:20.100
She repeats that a number of times about, like, people like Mike Cernovich and Jack

52:20.100 --> 52:23.980
Posobach and all these people, these influencers, not Alex.

52:23.980 --> 52:25.500
Well, they're all on.

52:25.500 --> 52:29.620
Alex is presumably on the same page because you haven't like Ali Alexander on another

52:29.620 --> 52:33.500
one of these figures who they all put aside their differences and they're like, we got

52:33.500 --> 52:34.780
to do something right.

52:34.780 --> 52:35.940
It's like, yeah, no shit.

52:35.940 --> 52:36.940
They are.

52:36.940 --> 52:37.940
Their game is over.

52:37.940 --> 52:38.940
Yeah.

52:38.940 --> 52:39.940
They have to.

52:39.940 --> 52:44.700
They all recognize that the door is closing on the scams they've been running.

52:44.700 --> 52:45.700
Right.

52:45.700 --> 52:48.100
Much like Drudge is like, hey, fuck Trump.

52:48.100 --> 52:49.220
He's going to destroy my business.

52:49.220 --> 52:53.060
Cernovich is like, I think we should probably start a war because they're fucking up my

52:53.060 --> 52:54.060
business.

52:54.060 --> 52:55.060
Yeah.

52:55.060 --> 52:56.060
Yeah.

52:56.060 --> 53:00.820
And we're just like, we're going to very quickly not have much relevance.

53:00.820 --> 53:01.820
Yeah.

53:01.820 --> 53:02.820
Yeah.

53:02.820 --> 53:03.820
Yeah.

53:03.820 --> 53:04.820
We're going to be in the opposition.

53:04.820 --> 53:05.820
Right.

53:05.820 --> 53:11.980
Uh, there's already, I guess I could just be an MRA guy again or I could be, do my pickup

53:11.980 --> 53:13.440
artist thing again, maybe.

53:13.440 --> 53:14.940
Just get your real estate license.

53:14.940 --> 53:15.940
Shit.

53:15.940 --> 53:16.940
Cernovich.

53:16.940 --> 53:17.940
He's a lawyer.

53:17.940 --> 53:18.940
Cernovich.

53:18.940 --> 53:19.940
Just sell houses.

53:19.940 --> 53:20.940
He's technically a lawyer.

53:20.940 --> 53:21.940
Yeah.

53:21.940 --> 53:22.940
Yeah.

53:22.940 --> 53:23.940
He should sell houses.

53:23.940 --> 53:24.940
Sure.

53:24.940 --> 53:25.940
Why not?

53:25.940 --> 53:26.940
Um, yeah.

53:26.940 --> 53:27.940
And I think that phenomenon is kind of interesting.

53:27.940 --> 53:29.140
I don't experience it because I don't know what any of these ding dongs are up to privately,

53:29.140 --> 53:33.900
but it is, it is interesting to hear her say like, oh, everyone's putting their, their

53:33.900 --> 53:34.900
heads together.

53:34.900 --> 53:35.900
They can't, they have to figure out how to survive.

53:35.900 --> 53:36.900
What's our new scam.

53:36.900 --> 53:37.900
Yeah.

53:37.900 --> 53:38.900
The, the swamp is congealed.

53:38.900 --> 53:40.580
How do we, how do we escape this?

53:40.580 --> 53:41.580
Yeah.

53:41.580 --> 53:44.180
Uh, let's claim Laura Loomer actually won.

53:44.180 --> 53:45.180
Yeah.

53:45.180 --> 53:48.340
That is, that is, that's so stupid.

53:48.340 --> 53:52.300
They because, Oh man, here's the great thing about later on.

53:52.300 --> 53:54.140
And here's my, here's my guess.

53:54.140 --> 53:59.260
We're going to see a very close parallel between what happens at info wars whenever Alex has

53:59.260 --> 54:02.980
gone and what happens in the far right whenever Trump has gone.

54:02.980 --> 54:06.620
I think there'll be some, some fractioning, you know, some of them are competent.

54:06.620 --> 54:10.940
I think there'll be some splintering off, but you'll see, you'll see kind of, I think

54:10.940 --> 54:14.040
what's going to happen to everybody is basically what's happened to people who've been kicked

54:14.040 --> 54:15.040
off Twitter.

54:15.040 --> 54:16.040
Yeah.

54:16.040 --> 54:20.100
It's just like they will sort of spiral a little bit and be like, even if you had a

54:20.100 --> 54:22.580
platform, this is worse.

54:22.580 --> 54:23.580
Yeah.

54:23.580 --> 54:28.300
Um, and, and I think that, you know, you'll really see the difference between people who

54:28.300 --> 54:32.500
have something and are safe and are not.

54:32.500 --> 54:36.260
People like Jack Posobick and Mike Cernovich are not secure.

54:36.260 --> 54:39.660
I don't think they're stable in their media position.

54:39.660 --> 54:45.740
People like Ben Shapiro or Alex, they are, they're, they're like, Alex has some issues

54:45.740 --> 54:51.260
to iron out and figure out what he's going to do, but he also has millions and a gigantic

54:51.260 --> 54:52.840
media operation.

54:52.840 --> 54:55.420
Like he's going to be able to figure out something to do.

54:55.420 --> 54:56.660
It might be embarrassing as hell.

54:56.660 --> 55:00.340
He might lose a bunch of his audience, but he'll figure out something.

55:00.340 --> 55:04.820
Ben Shapiro's probably going to be embarrassed for a little bit, but he'll be fine.

55:04.820 --> 55:05.820
Yeah.

55:05.820 --> 55:06.820
He'll be fine.

55:06.820 --> 55:07.820
He'll figure out something to do.

55:07.820 --> 55:08.820
He'll become a different type of mass asshole.

55:08.820 --> 55:09.820
Yeah.

55:09.820 --> 55:14.580
Jack Posobick is going to keep working at like what, these, these fringe OAN type outlets.

55:14.580 --> 55:15.580
Probably.

55:15.580 --> 55:16.580
There's just nowhere.

55:16.580 --> 55:18.060
There's no path forward there.

55:18.060 --> 55:22.020
Speaking of people who are going to be fine, I think because they just have a big enough

55:22.020 --> 55:23.020
brand.

55:23.020 --> 55:24.020
James O'Keefe comes on.

55:24.020 --> 55:25.620
You think James O'Keefe is going to be fine, huh?

55:25.620 --> 55:26.620
Yes.

55:26.620 --> 55:27.620
I think he's going to be fine.

55:27.620 --> 55:32.260
I think he has enough of a brand and name recognition inside of like the larger conservative

55:32.260 --> 55:33.260
sphere.

55:33.260 --> 55:34.260
Sure.

55:34.260 --> 55:37.580
That he could sort of abandon a lot of these like things that are tailored to the Trump

55:37.580 --> 55:39.620
base and he could be fine.

55:39.620 --> 55:44.780
He'll, I think he, he's, if you're associated with Andrew Breitbart personally, I don't

55:44.780 --> 55:48.540
think you're ever going to be like, yeah, yeah, there'll be, there'll be a way for you

55:48.540 --> 55:49.940
to keep failing upwards.

55:49.940 --> 55:50.940
Yeah.

55:50.940 --> 55:55.620
He comes on with a terrible phone connection and he's just talking about voter fraud.

55:55.620 --> 55:59.300
It's really hard to listen to because the voter, sorry, the phone line is awful.

55:59.300 --> 56:00.300
Yeah.

56:00.300 --> 56:01.440
And then it's also very sad.

56:01.440 --> 56:05.680
It honestly comes off less about like he's trying to prove some kind of claim.

56:05.680 --> 56:09.600
It seems more like he has this narrative that he wants to sell to people and he's trying

56:09.600 --> 56:14.620
to recruit other people to play the role of whistleblowers for him, like to use them as

56:14.620 --> 56:16.340
props.

56:16.340 --> 56:17.340
He's multi-level marketing.

56:17.340 --> 56:18.340
Yeah.

56:18.340 --> 56:19.340
Yeah.

56:19.340 --> 56:20.340
Would you like to be a prop in my next?

56:20.340 --> 56:21.340
Absolutely.

56:21.340 --> 56:23.500
And you can recruit three more people to be props in yours.

56:23.500 --> 56:24.500
Yeah.

56:24.500 --> 56:30.340
But what we need today is more people at the polls, people who are poll watchers, people

56:30.340 --> 56:34.300
who handle ballots to blow the whistle in an army of whistleblowers.

56:34.300 --> 56:36.100
I can't emphasize this enough.

56:36.100 --> 56:39.180
Now is the time today, tonight for you to do this.

56:39.180 --> 56:40.180
Absolutely.

56:40.180 --> 56:41.180
Don't wait.

56:41.180 --> 56:43.420
Our destiny, our future, our, our very birthright's being stolen.

56:43.420 --> 56:47.340
So yeah, he's just trying to enlist people to come like be, be a guest star in my next

56:47.340 --> 56:48.340
video.

56:48.340 --> 56:50.980
It seems like a, the way he gets all of his quote, whistleblowers.

56:50.980 --> 56:51.980
Yeah.

56:51.980 --> 56:52.980
Yeah.

56:52.980 --> 56:53.980
I found it very uninteresting.

56:53.980 --> 56:54.980
Yeah.

56:54.980 --> 56:58.860
So Alex has now decided at this point in the show, I got to go somewhere.

56:58.860 --> 57:01.900
Cernovich went to Arizona and people seem to enjoy that.

57:01.900 --> 57:02.900
Yeah.

57:02.900 --> 57:06.460
There's people yelling in States.

57:06.460 --> 57:08.060
This is still wet concrete.

57:08.060 --> 57:09.060
Yeah.

57:09.060 --> 57:10.180
We could still do something.

57:10.180 --> 57:11.180
Sure.

57:11.180 --> 57:15.100
There's still some attention and Arizona seems like it's getting closer.

57:15.100 --> 57:19.600
So that might be one where we actually might eke out a win and Maricopa County's the home

57:19.600 --> 57:22.060
of Joe Arpaio, who I also love so much.

57:22.060 --> 57:23.060
I hope he dies.

57:23.060 --> 57:26.900
Um, and so Alex decides he's got to go somewhere, but he doesn't know where

57:26.900 --> 57:33.340
I feel like I'm in Las Eisley spaceport, go to Los Eisley, what airplane to get on where

57:33.340 --> 57:39.020
I'm going to go because there's no way I can sit back while this is going on.

57:39.020 --> 57:45.060
Should I go to Arizona or should I go to Georgia or should I go to Michigan?

57:45.060 --> 57:47.980
God almighty.

57:47.980 --> 57:50.820
You ever try to fly direct from Los Eisley to Arizona?

57:50.820 --> 57:51.820
It's hellish.

57:51.820 --> 57:52.820
It's a long flight.

57:52.820 --> 57:53.820
It's a long flight.

57:53.820 --> 57:54.820
It's a long flight.

57:54.820 --> 57:55.820
Yeah.

57:55.820 --> 57:56.820
You're going to have to take a couple of stops.

57:56.820 --> 58:00.580
And you wind up in a wretched hive of scum and villainy.

58:00.580 --> 58:01.580
Yeah.

58:01.580 --> 58:06.660
So Alex, you know, we all know that he eventually ends up going to Arizona, but he has a really

58:06.660 --> 58:08.660
difficult time figuring out where to go.

58:08.660 --> 58:09.660
Sure.

58:09.660 --> 58:13.660
And now as the show goes on too, like earlier, he was kind of just like puzzling over why

58:13.660 --> 58:16.420
Trump is not appearing right anywhere.

58:16.420 --> 58:18.980
And he's kind of like, Hey, he's just letting the people act.

58:18.980 --> 58:19.980
That was earlier.

58:19.980 --> 58:20.980
Yeah.

58:20.980 --> 58:24.700
As the show goes on, he starts to get a little bit mad about the fact that Trump is hiding.

58:24.700 --> 58:25.700
Wow.

58:25.700 --> 58:30.300
It begins Democrat lawmakers call on Twitter to remove us president from the platform because

58:30.300 --> 58:35.980
he's not giving speeches, but you're a hundred times more viral.

58:35.980 --> 58:38.020
Where is the president?

58:38.020 --> 58:40.380
We haven't seen him unless I'm wrong crew.

58:40.380 --> 58:43.740
Your watch as much as I do or more, a lot more eyeballs than I do.

58:43.740 --> 58:50.780
I got two eyeballs, two eyeball at four, six, eight, like 12, 14 eyeballs in there.

58:50.780 --> 58:56.060
Has Trump been seen since three 30 in the morning on a Wednesday?

58:56.060 --> 58:59.340
Just asking, you know, we're talking 36 hours ago.

58:59.340 --> 59:01.660
Has anybody seen the president?

59:01.660 --> 59:03.580
Did the cookie monster eat him?

59:03.580 --> 59:09.180
Oh, cookie, I mean, I mean, where, where is the president?

59:09.180 --> 59:10.340
Where is the president?

59:10.340 --> 59:13.860
I've tried to like defend the president and I love the president and I think he overalls

59:13.860 --> 59:14.860
in a great job.

59:14.860 --> 59:21.820
And I, but I mean, we're in the middle of the Alamo war here and we ain't seen Colonel

59:21.820 --> 59:26.540
Travis in a day and a half, huh?

59:26.540 --> 59:29.520
Just like the real Colonel Travis, he's off drunk somewhere.

59:29.520 --> 59:31.580
I mean like, I don't know.

59:31.580 --> 59:35.780
I don't take fault with that thought like devoid of anything else he's saying.

59:35.780 --> 59:41.640
It's like, yeah, you should be, you should be frustrated that Trump isn't really guiding

59:41.640 --> 59:42.640
the folks.

59:42.640 --> 59:47.960
Is that, is that why, what if all of those predictions of like Trumpism is never going

59:47.960 --> 59:52.660
to leave us or are all countered by the fact that we didn't expect them to eventually be

59:52.660 --> 59:55.700
like, Hey, Trump sucks at this.

59:55.700 --> 59:56.700
Hmm.

59:56.700 --> 59:57.700
I think so.

59:57.700 --> 01:00:03.140
When he finally betrays them at the end, they're finally like, Oh shit, we got conned.

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.520
Well, no.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:08.860
I think a lot of the underlying things are what you have to be more worried about and

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:16.220
someone who isn't as much of a very clear con man carrying out some of those political

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:21.260
things and the flaws that in our system that Trump has exploited, the recognizing that

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:27.420
there is no reason to not act like a dick hole and there are no reason to follow norms

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:33.420
apparently because well, decent people do unwritten rules are just things that people

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:34.420
whine about.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.420
Yeah.

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:39.660
So people have generally been beholden to a lot of those things and I think Trump has

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:43.300
really exposed that there's no reason to follow them.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.540
There's no consequence for breaking any of them.

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:46.540
Totally.

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:50.540
I mean, even in baseball, if you do a bat flip to agree, just you get hit in the back

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:52.380
with a bit of a fastball.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.380
Well, yeah.

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:54.380
I will.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.380
Okay.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:56.380
We get to hit Trump in the back with a fastball.

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:58.780
I think that's fine with a 97 mile an hour.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:02.900
Someone who's less of a very overt con man and someone who's a lot more capable and has

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:08.940
the same sort of policies that appeal to people who recognize the ways in which they can break

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.260
unwritten rules and stuff.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.540
And that's kind of what you more have to be really worried about.

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.940
And I think that those people will again fall for that.

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:16.940
Yeah.

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:17.940
It's not hard.

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:18.940
No.

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:22.340
So Alex, he's like, fuck, I need to go somewhere.

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:26.820
I haven't seen Trump on TV in a long time.

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:29.260
I'm going to fucking take a nap.

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:34.100
Maybe I'm going to get a jet airplane to fly me up to DC.

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.060
That's where I need to be.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:42.340
See, I'm ready to take action that I'm trying to like, I can't overanalyze this.

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:47.580
I have to, I have to go to my sleepy place.

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.500
That's the joke of a meme of that.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:53.620
But I mean, I have to like, I literally, I'll go take a 30 minute nap sometimes and go,

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.620
what is the answer to something?

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:57.180
And I go to bed and then I'll have a dream of what to do.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:01.860
So I got to get dialed into my subconscious, allow show secret sauce there.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:04.740
And I think I got to sleep here.

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:08.880
I got to have the engine turn off with in my mind.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.880
What do I do?

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:10.880
And I'll wake up with the answer.

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.180
Is it DC?

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:14.920
Is it Georgia?

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.160
Is it Arizona?

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.500
Is it Detroit?

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:23.620
I don't know.

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.500
Go to hell.

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:30.460
But I mean, I just can't sit here with this amount of history going down and do nothing.

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:35.060
I've got to take action.

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:39.380
Oh my God.

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:47.860
I just love the idea that he's sitting here.

01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:48.860
I got to do something.

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:50.660
I just, there's so much history going on.

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:51.660
I got to do something.

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:54.020
I'm going to take a nap.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.220
I think I'll dream my solution.

01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:04.140
The reason that this show is, I do recognize that even, you know, with Trump not being

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:07.700
in power, I'm still entirely fascinated by Alex.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:11.380
And the reason is that this show is like, it's a compelling psychodrama.

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:12.380
It is.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.380
It is.

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:17.220
We're in the next season where he's just confused for the next year.

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:21.660
Well, I think he'll be confused for a bit, but I think he'll land quicker than that.

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.060
Maybe he should just go to Tibet.

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:25.140
I hear that's where people find themselves.

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:26.140
Let Owen take over.

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:27.140
Yeah.

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:28.140
Yeah, totally.

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.300
Just become a fucking Buddhist out there.

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.300
Just do it.

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.300
Calm down.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:33.300
Relax.

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.300
Live your life a little bit.

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.300
That certainly would be interesting.

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.300
Yeah.

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:37.300
But there's a 30% chance that he won't need to do that.

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:38.300
Okay.

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:42.860
I'd give Trump a 30% chance we pull this out, prove the fraud.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:45.420
But no, it's, we're a judge nation.

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:48.980
Nobody came for those babies getting chopped up, 62 million of them.

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:55.420
Nobody came for all the kids getting kidnapped by the left, putting torture rings.

01:03:55.420 --> 01:04:00.580
And so we just had it good too long and God's sick of us not caring and not being involved.

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:03.740
God says, I'm going to burn you now.

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:04.740
Whoa.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.220
You got to get a better God, man.

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:08.700
So I guess we've been judged and we're going to burn.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.940
God is really, really turning on a hairpin these days.

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:17.460
30% chance that's not going to happen though if Trump somehow proves that the election

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:18.460
fraud.

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.060
He will stay God's hair.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.060
Proves it.

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.060
Good God.

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:23.060
Yeah.

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:24.060
What are we doing?

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:30.300
So apparently Patriots are being culled from the internet and Alex has a familiar thing

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:33.420
happened to him as he's trying to discuss this.

01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:37.500
They're going through everybody that's been identified as a Patriot for this coup and

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.160
they're blocking and freezing or banning your account.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.540
This is a takeover.

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:46.040
When the lights go out, the communications go out, that's when the troops start coming

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.020
down to the parachutes, metaphysically.

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.020
Well, this is it.

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.120
This is the bigger soul.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.120
At least you're full grown adults.

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.660
You're not a baby in the womb, got chopped up, didn't have a chance.

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.180
So we deserve what's about to happen.

01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:07.380
Get close to Jesus and wake up or get your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye.

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.700
Go ahead and play that report.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.980
The one that Rob do gave us where it's like five minutes long, but we're gonna play the

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:15.140
one where I predict all of the stuff is now happening.

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.900
That was the one I talked about.

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:19.500
We have that.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.500
Also need for that either.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.500
No need for that either.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.620
All right, we're going to push Matt Bracken back because we're going to have a moment

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.260
of clarity here.

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:29.940
Rob came in about two hours ago and he said, we've got this video and I said, that's wonderful.

01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:30.940
Just tell them about it.

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:31.940
We'll have it.

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:32.940
No problem.

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:33.940
Take care of it.

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:39.500
And, uh, we had a little meetings about it and now we don't have it and I'm not mad.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.500
I love it.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:41.500
I love it.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.500
It's okay.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:49.900
So it's all of us phones and computers have obituated us not to get face to face and have

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:50.900
a meeting.

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:51.940
So my crew works their ass off.

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:57.400
They're amazing, but they produce so much information that if they don't face to face

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.700
and have that decision, it never happens.

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:00.700
So that's okay.

01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.020
Cause it's not bad to have a mistake on a live show.

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:04.900
We're going to air that on air.

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:05.900
It's going to happen.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.740
If I have to host the next five hours, it's going to happen.

01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:10.320
So that's what all this is about.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.200
That's what all this is about.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.340
You understand?

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:14.340
That's what all this is about.

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:17.300
Did he just tell me that his employees don't read emails?

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:22.300
Um, maybe they got to do this face to face face to face.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:25.940
They ignore me if I'm not yelling at them.

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:28.740
I can't get tone and email.

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:29.740
I try all caps.

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:30.740
It doesn't work.

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:31.740
It doesn't do anything for me.

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:32.740
Yeah.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:38.040
I mean, I just thought I'd put that in there cause I mean, that is what this is all about.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:41.300
People thought, I know that I've heard this feedback from the audience a lot.

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.300
Sure, sure, sure.

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:48.420
If Biden wins, Alex's tech problems will go away because he'll recognize that he's got

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:54.340
to get his shit together and they'll really clean up a shop and take care of business.

01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:55.340
No.

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.700
Another storyline to follow in, uh, Alex and Tibet.

01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.180
I'm going to call it that this season.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:01.180
That's what we're going to do.

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.180
Um, sure.

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.420
I'm down with that.

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:07.900
So in this next clip, this is the last one from Alex's show on November 5th and that

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:10.380
is him handing it off to Matt Bracken.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:18.180
Uh, noted weirdo, uh, Matt Bracken, fourth hour host and nothing else, Matt Bracken.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:23.540
Um, Alex needs to go somewhere and he needs to get some guidance about where to go.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:26.500
So you ask Matt Bracken, where am I going?

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:33.220
I'm planning to get on an airplane and either go to, uh, either go to, uh, Arizona or go

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.220
to Georgia.

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:36.220
Let me ask Matt Bracken this question.

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:37.220
I'm gonna play this clip.

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:40.020
Matt, where do you think people need to be the most on the ground?

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:41.700
Is it, is it Detroit?

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:43.980
Is it, uh, is it Arizona?

01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:44.980
Is it Georgia?

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:45.980
They're trying to steal them all right now.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.740
They already got Detroit.

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:49.940
It's a multi-front war.

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:54.900
I would probably say Philadelphia because if, if, uh, if it's, if it doesn't happen

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:56.920
in Pennsylvania, it doesn't matter.

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:02.140
The other ones are peripheral, you know, the path, all of the pathways for Trump require

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:03.500
our Pennsylvania.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.500
Good point, Matt.

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:08.500
I'm going to Arizona, Arizona.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:13.300
Why do you even ask people stuff?

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:16.860
All right, Matt, that's a, that's a very good point.

01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:17.980
That is a good point.

01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:21.460
I have friends in Arizona and Philly will beat the shit out of me.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:22.460
I will get my ass kicked.

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:23.460
I'm going to go to Arizona.

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:25.460
I'm not going to be in Philly.

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:26.460
Not going to be in Philly.

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:27.460
Did you see that?

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:29.580
There were people dancing and they want to hurt me.

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:30.580
Yeah.

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:32.540
Uh, Gritty is going to kick my ass.

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:34.260
Gritty will kick your ass.

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:39.860
Uh, so Alex goes to take a nap, I guess, and then the spirits come to him and tell him

01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:40.860
to go to Arizona.

01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:41.860
Okay.

01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:42.860
I don't fucking know.

01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:43.860
Something like that.

01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:49.620
Uh, but while he's taking a nap, Owen Troyer comes in to host the war room and, uh, Owen

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:52.060
has a big guest, uh, on the show.

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:53.060
Oh no.

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.500
I get the sense that by this point, Alex has left.

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.460
I think he's already on route to Arizona.

01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:58.460
Yeah.

01:08:58.460 --> 01:08:59.460
Okay.

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:03.620
Uh, because there is a sense of like, we should get Alex in on this and he's unavailable.

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:04.620
Uh oh.

01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:09.660
Uh, so he's either taking that nap or he's on his way to Arizona, but big guest.

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:12.780
But Dr. Steve Pacinek, uh, as we're in the middle of this, the election's over.

01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:15.060
We're now in the stealing process of the election.

01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:16.800
Uh, what are you seeing?

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:22.060
What's going through your mind as you're witnessing this gigantic hoax?

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:24.180
Number one, it's not a hoax.

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:30.460
What's happening now and the reason I couldn't come on the Alex Jones show last night was

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:35.140
I was not given the permission that I needed to in order to say what I'm about to say now.

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.180
I do not work for the federal government.

01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:38.180
I'm not paid by them.

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:42.300
Make it clear I don't work for the government.

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:43.300
We know.

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:44.300
We know, Steve.

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:49.420
So yeah, it's at first it sounded like he was talking from inside a bottle.

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:50.420
Sure.

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:51.420
Sure.

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:52.420
But, uh, I guess it turned the game up on us.

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:54.940
Turn that up just a little bit so we can hear the doctor.

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:55.940
Yeah.

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:57.860
He didn't have permission to say something.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:04.580
I didn't get the go ahead from Melania and now we will be taking over everything.

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:08.900
I am consort to Melania, queen of the earth.

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:09.940
Can I be honest with you?

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:10.940
What's that?

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.820
I think that he knew that this shit wouldn't fly with Alex.

01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:14.180
Yeah, I absolutely think that.

01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.660
I think that that's what permission means.

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:17.780
That's exactly what I thought.

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:21.060
Yeah, because here's what he's got here because I couldn't say this on Alex's show.

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.060
He wouldn't let me.

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.940
Here's what Steve recently got permission to say.

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:25.940
Gotcha.

01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:32.340
This is really a sting operation, contrary to what everybody else said, Trump knew this

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:33.340
was happening.

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:37.180
Eric knew this was happening and warn the public.

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:41.100
I knew this was happening, however, I could not say anything about it.

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:42.100
Of course not.

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:49.820
What happened was we marked watermark every ballot with what's called the Q F S block

01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:51.540
chain encryption code.

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:57.420
In other words, we know pretty well where every ballot is, where it went and who has

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.420
it.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.540
So this is not a stolen election.

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:07.540
On the contrary, we reversed the entire game of war along the lines of the sons of the

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:08.980
art of war.

01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:11.940
And Trump was brilliant and still is brilliant at it.

01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:17.500
So what we've got here is Steve claiming that the election was actually a sting operation

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:23.380
to catch voter fraud, wherein the department of Homeland security has watermarked all of

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:24.940
these ballots with block chain.

01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:26.900
He does not explain what he means by that.

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.100
Oh, don't worry about it.

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:29.940
And they can be traced.

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:33.820
They know literally where every single ballot is at any point.

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:36.860
And because of this watermark, they can tell which ones are fake.

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:38.260
So there's a bunch of ballots.

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:41.140
They know, Oh, no watermark, these are fake.

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.300
This is a load of horse shit.

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:43.300
Yeah, this is not good.

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.300
This is real bad.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.300
This is real bad.

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:53.860
One of the reasons why this is really particularly bad is this is a narrative that is so provable.

01:11:53.860 --> 01:12:01.380
This is one that like, if you have this information, if Trump really does have this, first of all,

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:02.820
he needs to bring it out.

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:03.820
That's the only thing he needs to do.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:09.400
I still don't want him to be president, but he has a moral obligation to tell the nation.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:13.540
This is exactly what you would do like the day after they called everybody would be like,

01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:17.100
okay, now we're going to reveal that this was all a sting operation.

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.100
Yeah.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.460
Now it turns out this backfires because no one cares and they all think I already lost

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.460
the election.

01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:23.460
It's...

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:24.460
Oh, that's not good.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.860
But you'd have this hard evidence.

01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:26.860
That's true.

01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:27.860
That's true.

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:28.860
This is hard evidence.

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:29.860
I'm sure it is.

01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:32.380
You have to keep these conspiracies non-falsifiable.

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:39.500
They have to be like vague and about coups and counter coups and moves and shadowy things.

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.820
This is too concrete.

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:43.100
It's absolute.

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.140
I have a, I have another problem with this.

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:46.140
Oh, just one?

01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:47.140
Just one.

01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:48.140
All right.

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:52.180
So he is saying we, I assume he can't mean he, he's not including himself.

01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:53.380
He always talks like that.

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:56.940
He says that I have, I have 17,000 troops in Germany.

01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.660
I was going to say, he always does that.

01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.500
He speaks in the first person about everything.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:05.580
It's just like we have watermarked these ballots, but then he started with, I don't work for

01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:06.580
the federal government.

01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:07.580
He's a ramp...

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:10.200
What the fuck do you work for that's watermarking all these ballots?

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.700
He's a rampant narcissist.

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:12.700
Totally.

01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:13.700
Yeah.

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:14.700
This is a QAnon thing too.

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:15.700
This was going around in QAnon.

01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:16.700
Yeah, no, I've heard this one.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:17.700
Yeah.

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.380
And also I was thinking about it as like, why is Steve into this?

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:22.660
One, I think it's cause he's into QAnon.

01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:23.660
Sure.

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:28.060
Two, I was researching like watermarked ballots and one of the places that it comes up the

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:34.500
most as like a very like con, like a normally used thing is in condo association elections

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.380
in Florida.

01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:42.060
Now Steve lives in Florida.

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:45.620
So it's gated communities.

01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:48.180
That's where all watermarked ballots...

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:52.420
It's an issue that's discussed on a number of websites about condo association elections

01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:55.360
and like ways to keep them secure.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.980
And so like, I think that maybe he has some experience with the idea from that.

01:13:58.980 --> 01:13:59.980
That's very funny.

01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:02.700
And maybe he's projecting that onto the world.

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.420
Anyway, this is silly.

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:05.420
Yeah.

01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:06.420
It's not good.

01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:07.900
And it gets worse.

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:09.620
All of this was expected.

01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:14.140
All of this is part of the sting operation we're running.

01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:20.160
And let me tell you that 48 hours ago, not only did we put markers on those ballots,

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:26.460
but I can say now with the permission of people in the intelligence community and elsewhere

01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:33.140
that we have sent out thousands and thousands of national guards to 12 different States,

01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:38.140
Washington, Delaware, Texas, Arizona, Alabama, and everywhere.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:43.180
So now you have to consider and rethink what this is really about.

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:45.460
This is about the constitution, clearly.

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:46.460
Wait.

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:51.460
So the governors of those States, I assume, approved the national guard.

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:52.860
Invited in the national guard.

01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:55.100
Because that's how it has to work.

01:14:55.100 --> 01:15:01.660
And all these States who run their own elections have agreed to his watermarking of the ballot.

01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:02.660
Of course.

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:03.660
Yeah.

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:04.660
Okay.

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:05.660
Whatever.

01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:06.660
This is deeply unconstitutional.

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:07.660
Get the fuck out of here.

01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:08.660
Get the fuck out of here.

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:09.660
Get the fuck out of here.

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:10.660
Yeah.

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:12.660
Anyway, so that's kind of like how you would respond if you were Owen, hearing this.

01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:13.660
Sure, sure, sure.

01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:14.660
Fuck off, Owen.

01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:15.660
Get the fuck out of here.

01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:16.660
Fuck off.

01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:17.660
What are you doing?

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:18.660
Come on.

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:19.660
This is terrible.

01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:20.660
He's wearing a Hawaiian shirt, too.

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:21.660
Yeah.

01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:22.660
He was not.

01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:23.660
Yes.

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:24.660
You can't be running the revolution in a goddamn Hawaiian shirt.

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:25.660
He's sitting there.

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:28.020
He's like, ah, I might as well have like a drink and a coconut in my hand.

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:29.020
Yeah, why not?

01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:30.020
Yeah, yeah.

01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:31.020
Here's how Owen responds.

01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.020
Okay.

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:36.580
Steve, you've just broken certainly perhaps the biggest news since the election here on

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:37.580
the show.

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:40.220
I have to play this out logically in my head.

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:41.220
Okay.

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:44.460
That's why I go on your show to basically, I keep saying-

01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:45.460
Well, I love you, Steve.

01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:48.100
I'd kiss you on the lips right now if it wasn't digitally.

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:49.100
Aha.

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:50.100
So he's thrilled.

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:51.100
Of course he is.

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:52.420
Now, Steve wants to make this even better.

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:53.420
Yeah, of course.

01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:54.540
Because there's even better news.

01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:55.660
Come on.

01:15:55.660 --> 01:16:01.900
People will be arrested as of tonight, tomorrow, and it will go on for quite a while.

01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:05.620
And this was a total sting operation that I can say.

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:06.620
Okay.

01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:07.700
Well, this did not happen.

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:13.140
The Red Wedding will play itself out every night for years to come.

01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:15.660
There will be blood in the streets.

01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:19.380
Until only Melania is left.

01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:22.940
Melania will stand to take the Game of Thrones.

01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:23.940
Yeah.

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.940
All right.

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:26.940
Okay.

01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:33.120
This is getting a little more Q than Steve usually is.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:40.780
Like he's usually either cranky, racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic.

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:44.340
He usually has something going on, or wants to insult Alex a bunch.

01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:45.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:46.340
Those are the best.

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:47.340
He does seem to have themed appearances.

01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:48.340
Yeah.

01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:49.340
This is quite Q.

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:50.340
Yeah.

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:55.460
And it's strange, but I also think that he knows on some level, whether it's rationally

01:16:55.460 --> 01:17:00.200
and consciously or just sort of, ah, best not to try, he knows that Alex wouldn't put

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.200
up with this, probably.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.200
No, no, no, no.

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:05.260
We're trying to say that this election was stolen.

01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:06.260
Yeah.

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:07.260
That's the business.

01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:08.560
That's where the money is.

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:14.660
You saying this is something that's going to be completely disproven, or it'll be like

01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:16.900
never proven, like why wasn't it?

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:17.900
Exactly.

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.420
This is going to be a big problem for us.

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:21.460
We can't make money off this.

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:24.140
You're trying to build a pay-per-view match that no one wants to see.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.340
This is a day-long story.

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:27.340
At best.

01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:29.700
This is a day-long story at best, and that's only on the War Room.

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:32.300
This is a distraction for the junior varsity.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.300
Oh, man.

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.300
Yeah.

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:35.300
Yeah.

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:36.300
Give this to Owen while I'm out.

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:37.300
Yeah.

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:38.300
So Steve talks a little bit more about this.

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:44.340
I still don't really understand what he's describing.

01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:48.500
I would love for him to actually say what all this technology is, but he doesn't do

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:49.500
that.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:50.500
All right.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:56.100
So how is this watermark on the ballots, what is the significance of that as to, is it going

01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:59.940
to stop from fake balance being counted, or how is that going to be used?

01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:04.480
Well, we use it in any way that we need to use it in terms of counting, knowing which

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.500
ones were fake, which ones were not.

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.740
It's a very sophisticated code.

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:15.100
So if you just throw them away, these are cyber communication implementations that we

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:18.220
have the code for, and we know exactly what was thrown away.

01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:20.180
We know exactly what was placed.

01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:23.860
We know exactly who has it, and we know exactly where it went.

01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:26.900
I can't go any further than that.

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:27.900
Wow.

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:32.860
This is a huge news that Steve Pechenik is breaking on our show right now.

01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:34.540
Some would call it news.

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:35.540
Some would not.

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:40.540
I mean, yeah, I'm going to go with, I don't think I'm going to buy that one, Dan.

01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:45.140
If I were Owen, I'd be like, wow, Steve's having fun today.

01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:46.140
He's on one.

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:47.140
Yeah.

01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:48.140
Yeah.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.140
Steve's dressed for the occasion.

01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:53.220
He showed up in his uniform for what this is, which is bullshit.

01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:54.220
Hold the fucking phone.

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:55.220
Yeah.

01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:58.340
If you know where every ballot is right now.

01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:01.140
Like God's Eye from the Fast and Furious movie.

01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:05.000
Like why are we bothering with all this nonsense?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.100
And if they're fake, why didn't you tell people at the ballot counting places that they were

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:11.100
fake?

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:12.340
Everywhere had people watching them.

01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:15.060
But you're not a showman.

01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:17.380
You don't understand the need for the reveal.

01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:18.380
You're right.

01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:19.380
You're right.

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:20.380
This was all my fault.

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:21.380
Yes.

01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:22.380
I didn't realize that we have to have the prestige.

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:23.380
I apologize.

01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:25.180
Why do the trick if there isn't the reveal?

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:26.180
I apologize.

01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:27.180
I get you.

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:28.180
You've got to do this.

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.180
No, no.

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:30.180
You're right.

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.420
That part makes total sense.

01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:36.220
If in Ocean's Eleven they just stole money and then left, that's a very bad movie.

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.220
I get it.

01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:38.220
Yeah.

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:41.780
He needs to explain a little bit more about what this tech he's describing is, why it's

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:42.780
so powerful.

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:43.780
Sure.

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:48.260
And then also, it's a big problem when nothing comes of this.

01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:49.260
Yeah.

01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:50.260
That's a real problem.

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:53.540
Because if you take Alex's instincts, even if he's desperate to come up with a way to

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:58.640
spin the election, he would know better than to take this on as something that he's going

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:03.060
to have to then deal with tomorrow and the day after and the day after.

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:06.260
It's much easier to say that there was someone who might have been Chinese who showed up

01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:08.220
at four in the morning with a box of ballots.

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.220
Done.

01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:10.220
Try and disprove me.

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:12.680
You don't even care enough to disprove me.

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:17.060
But if you start saying some shit like, I know where every ballot is, now we're in trouble,

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:18.060
man.

01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:19.060
Yeah, yeah.

01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.060
Now I got to deal with shit.

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:21.060
Absolutely.

01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:24.460
Like somebody saying stuff like, why didn't you just use a barcode?

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:27.620
So Owen gets a little bit high on this.

01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:28.620
Of course.

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:31.220
On Steve's inside exclusive.

01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:32.220
He's young.

01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:33.220
Yeah.

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:35.820
And he perhaps just broke the biggest news story of the day.

01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:40.220
He did it in a floral button up shirt with a smile on his face from his kitchen.

01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:45.520
So Fox News and mainstream news and all you with your billions of dollars and your big

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:51.700
pharmaceutical contracts, I'll keep it PG rated, you can go fudge yourselves, okay?

01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:55.180
Go fudge yourselves and enjoy it as well.

01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:57.980
Now I want to hone in on what Dr. Pacinik broke.

01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:01.780
Again, folks, Steve can reiterate this in his own words.

01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:09.500
The whole election theft was a setup.

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:10.900
Try and say it.

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:12.140
Try and say it.

01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:14.740
That's my favorite thing.

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:19.020
That is just the best.

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:25.940
That is my, like what I like to laugh at is Owen taunting the mainstream fake news.

01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:26.940
Defiant.

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:34.460
Defiant in the face of all reality, listening to Dr. Steve Pacinik while he's masturbating

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:36.300
looking to photos of Melania.

01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:37.740
Oh my God.

01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:42.500
Now Steve, he's a weirdo.

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:43.500
Yeah.

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:44.500
Yeah.

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.500
I agree.

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:46.500
I agree.

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:50.420
Even when he comes in with this kind of thing, he's still going to say some things during

01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:53.460
the interview that are big problems for InfoWars.

01:21:53.460 --> 01:22:00.540
And one of them comes in this next clip because Alex has been very, very clear that the Democrats

01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.180
are run by the Chinese.

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:03.180
And the devil.

01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:04.180
Well, through China.

01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:05.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:07.780
China is like the intermediary between the devil and the Democrats, basically.

01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:10.020
That's a tough job.

01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:12.100
Steve says, nah.

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:14.180
Who is running this Democrat party right now?

01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:15.260
I mean, who is running?

01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:16.260
Who is the brain trust?

01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:17.680
It's obviously not Biden.

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:18.780
I don't think it's Obama.

01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:19.780
Is it the Chinese?

01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:21.660
Are the Chinese setting them up?

01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:27.220
No, the Chinese are not part of it with all due respect to Chinese communism and all that.

01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:29.220
I know Chinese communism quite well.

01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:30.220
I know Xi.

01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:32.220
I've known about Mao Zedong.

01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:37.540
The real issue is the inherent corruption of a democratic party and its machinery.

01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:38.540
Wait, wait, wait.

01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:39.540
So the Chinese aren't involved at all?

01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:41.420
So the Chinese aren't involved at all.

01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:42.420
Wait, wait, Steve.

01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:44.420
I'm very familiar with Chinese communism.

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:45.660
Xi and I hang out.

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.620
We play golf on the weekends.

01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:49.820
He's part of my condo association.

01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:53.660
Before I leave, I'd like to contradict Alex's entire world here.

01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:54.660
Perfect.

01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:55.660
Wow.

01:22:55.660 --> 01:23:03.500
And while I'm here, there's no such thing as God.

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.900
The Chinese communists are not important.

01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:07.340
They're not a big deal.

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:09.860
The election was a sting operation.

01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:11.500
I gotta go.

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.380
You know who you gotta worry about?

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.380
Uruguay.

01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:17.220
They're big in the stealing elections game.

01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:19.140
This dude is throwing haymakers.

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:20.140
Wow.

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:21.140
Yeah.

01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:22.140
Love it.

01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.140
So they get talking a little bit about Obama.

01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:24.940
This is kind of funny.

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:31.180
When I heard Obama two days ago again say, in this democracy, we have the right to vote.

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:32.180
You moron Obama.

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:37.420
I mean, this is a CIA operative that I kept saying should have gone to prison.

01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:38.420
Everything in battle.

01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:39.420
Does Trump know that?

01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:40.420
Does Trump know who Obama is?

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:42.460
He knew already.

01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:43.460
He knew.

01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:46.780
But does he have the intelligence files too?

01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:48.260
I can't say that.

01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:49.260
Okay.

01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:50.660
Oh man.

01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:51.660
So funny.

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:52.660
Yeah.

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:53.660
He knows it.

01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:54.660
Does he have a file?

01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:55.660
I don't know.

01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:59.420
All of this seems so much more fun and less serious when I don't have like four years

01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:01.340
of murder to look forward to.

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:02.340
You know?

01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:03.340
Yeah.

01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:05.020
I mean, there's four years of, you know, still trouble.

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:08.480
Oh, gonna be a lot of trouble, but not like every...

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:14.740
It's more a situation of, I think we're still in a little bit of like exhaling.

01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:17.020
There is a big exhale going on.

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:19.780
And I think that you might be overselling like the...

01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:20.780
I'm trying.

01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:21.780
The feelings of relief and stuff.

01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:22.780
I'm trying to do more things in America.

01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.780
I'm trying, man.

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:27.700
And I think it's a really tough thing because, you know, like on the one hand, yes, don't

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:33.460
discount the fact that getting Trump out of office and him losing is very crucially important.

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:39.300
While, at the same time, don't lose sight of the fact that even though Biden gets in,

01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:42.720
it doesn't mean anything is fixed by itself.

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:45.820
There's still exactly the same amount of work that needs to be done.

01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.340
The same issues exist.

01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:52.160
I tweeted out just like, oh, fuck, Biden is president.

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.300
And then, oh, fuck, Biden is president.

01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:56.980
And people were like, don't ruin this for me.

01:24:56.980 --> 01:25:00.420
I'm like, no, no, no, you can hold these two thoughts simultaneously.

01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:02.100
These are not dissonant thoughts.

01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:03.660
These are nuanced thoughts.

01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:04.660
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:07.780
It could be, it could be, I mean, there's challenges.

01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:08.780
Yeah.

01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:09.780
And we just have to figure out.

01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:11.140
Shit's still got to get done.

01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:12.140
Yeah.

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:18.420
So Steve, we know from his time with Alex over the years, his normal methodology with

01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:20.300
Alex is to flatter him.

01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.300
Yes.

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:24.700
And we see this exact same behavior being applied to Owen here.

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:25.700
Please.

01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:29.620
You know, self-deprecation is not impressive to me, Owen.

01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:30.620
You're there.

01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:36.020
You have to talk a lot and it takes a lot of cajonas and it takes a lot of sense of

01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:40.540
self-worth and a sense of humor, which you and Alex have.

01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:43.800
And you got a great staff with Daria and Scott and all of them.

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:46.580
But the point was you were selected.

01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:53.500
I did not only selected you guys, but I personally selected you and those who I work with or

01:25:53.500 --> 01:26:00.040
deal with, friendly with, they understood that it would come for your show.

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.740
That to me sounds like Alex wouldn't buy this shit.

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.580
I was like, who could I go on?

01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:05.580
Uh, Owen.

01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:06.740
Owen will buy it.

01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:09.220
I think we're getting real delusional here.

01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:14.380
This has gone past like fun conspiracy theories to him being like, I control the universe.

01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:20.300
Well, and like I have this big breaking news and you know, you're so wonderful Owen that

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.700
I chose you to break the story.

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:29.220
That isn't like, I mean, it's nonsensical, but it's really him saying, I had nowhere

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:30.220
else to go.

01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:31.220
No, it is.

01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:32.220
Absolutely.

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:33.220
You were as good as I could do.

01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:36.140
So I'm going to butter you up really hard.

01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:42.300
So Owen's like, yeah, Alex, we need to get Alex in on this because this is big, like

01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:43.300
for them.

01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:45.340
Oh, and you are so, so young.

01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:49.300
Steve, if you could hold over Alex Jones, as soon as he heard Steve Pechenik break the

01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:53.180
huge news about the Trump sting, Alex Jones hopped in his race car.

01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:56.460
He's probably going about 160 miles per hour right now.

01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:00.420
He's probably on the phone with engineers trying to rig up like a car helicopter so

01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:02.980
we can get here faster and avoid traffic.

01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:04.740
Alex does not show up.

01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:09.660
And Owen ends up interviewing Jesse Lee Peterson after Steve.

01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:10.660
So I don't know.

01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:15.100
I don't, I think I feel like Alex would be like, shut it down.

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:16.100
Yeah.

01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.100
Shut it down.

01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:18.100
Yeah, totally.

01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:24.380
But Owen, Owen has that feel of like a literal apprentice situation where it's like the,

01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:28.460
the master is out of the room and I found something that I think is really exciting

01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:31.100
and it's like, this one and this one's mine.

01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:34.300
I discovered this one, this one, I'm going to take it to the master and he's going to

01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:35.300
be so proud of me.

01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:37.380
And then they, he's like, no, this is fucking stupid.

01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:40.940
Isn't that that Disney movie?

01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:41.940
The Sorcerer's Apprentice?

01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:42.940
Yeah.

01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:43.940
Isn't that basically the plot of Fantasia?

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:44.940
Yeah.

01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:45.940
Might be the plot of Fantasia.

01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:46.940
Yeah.

01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:47.940
You might be correct.

01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:50.740
Owen's accidentally made the mops dance around and they're all making a mess.

01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:52.740
Yeah, that's about it.

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:53.740
Yeah.

01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:55.340
That is exactly right.

01:27:55.340 --> 01:28:00.140
But it's still like, this is what I want plugged into my fucking veins.

01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:01.140
Of course.

01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:11.340
Ladies and gentlemen, we're back in the Infowars war room devastating the fake news media today

01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:16.860
with Dr. Steve Pacinek giving us the inside scoop of president Trump's sting operation

01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:18.380
that is ongoing right now.

01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:20.040
The traps have been sprung.

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.840
Traps are sprung.

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:24.420
Defending the fake news.

01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:27.980
There's a, there's a, there are two different completely feelings.

01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:30.300
Two different feelings, right?

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:35.260
There's the feeling of being proud of yourself and then having that pride punctured by someone

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:37.740
else and realizing I have failed.

01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:42.400
And then there's the feeling of hoping someone else will be proud of you.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:45.140
And when that gets punctured, that's devastating.

01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:47.420
I'm looking forward to hearing that from Owen.

01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:49.420
I want to hear that devastation.

01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:51.660
He thinks somebody's going to be so proud of him.

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:52.660
Yeah.

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:53.660
Yeah.

01:28:53.660 --> 01:29:01.540
Or he'll, I don't, God, it's just, there, it's a complex feeling that is like, I've

01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:02.540
done it.

01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:03.540
Yep.

01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:07.460
I have figured out how to save the world or something or totally, or even just like reduce

01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:08.460
it down.

01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:11.740
And on a cynical level, we're going to make a lot of money off this or something, you

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:16.140
know, like there's just, I've saved Infowars and you can see it in the moment.

01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:19.220
Like no, exactly right.

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.220
But because I hate them, it's hilarious.

01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:22.220
I love it.

01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:23.220
Yeah.

01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:24.220
This is, screw it.

01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:26.220
I would never laugh at conservative tears.

01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:28.980
Conservative hubris is the funniest thing in the world.

01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:29.980
Exactly.

01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:33.820
And that's really what I was feeling when it was like, what's the reverse that I can

01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:39.860
feel good about of election night 2016, Alex laughing at people crying.

01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:40.860
It's this.

01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:41.860
It is this.

01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:44.180
Owen being like, we're taking down the fake news.

01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:48.020
Pure, pure, pure joy I get from this.

01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:53.300
Owen either being unable or incapable of seeing through Steve Pechenik's bullshit.

01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:56.780
So transparently stupid bullshit.

01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:59.900
And being like, we got him, we got him.

01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:00.900
Fuck you, CNN.

01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:01.900
Oh, sorry.

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:05.540
Fudge you, CNN.

01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:07.420
We're past the emperor has no clothes.

01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:11.620
The emperor is walking down the street without skin and everybody's pointing and Owen is

01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:14.500
like, that's the emperor, baby!

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:15.900
Love that guy!

01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:20.660
So we have one last clip here of Steve, uh, talking to Owen and again, it's just the buttering

01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:21.660
up.

01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:22.660
Yeah.

01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:26.620
I was given the privilege of announcing this, but I don't know who else knows it.

01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:29.280
I don't know what else will happen.

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:35.420
The truth of the matter is that your show was chosen and you have the good or the benefit

01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:40.580
and I hope this will result in a lot of arrests and the end of a problem.

01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:41.580
Okay.

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:42.580
Yeah.

01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:43.580
Yeah.

01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:44.580
I wish you Godspeed.

01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:45.580
Yeah.

01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:53.220
So I hope this winds up with a lot of arrests.

01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:57.580
Like I said, uh, uh, Owen goes on to interview Jesse Lee Peterson.

01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:58.580
Yes.

01:30:58.580 --> 01:30:59.580
Then everyone went to sleep.

01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:00.580
Right.

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:08.420
And the next day we wake up and David Knight's show, uh, from November 6th, he realizes Owen

01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:11.140
got these brooms and mops dancing all over the place.

01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:12.380
I got to clean up.

01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:18.820
No, I know there's a theory that's come out saying we have watermarked ballots and this

01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:25.140
is all just a big sting and we should trust the plan and I'm telling you right now, I'll

01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:32.980
give you details on why I think that is absolute total gaslighting from a CIA official still

01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:34.900
working for them.

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:37.300
And uh, we'll, we'll talk about that coming up.

01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:40.160
That is absolute nonsense in my opinion.

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:42.660
So it's pajama kicked off the show forever.

01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:49.180
So David Knight comes in and he's like, fuck you.

01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:53.180
When I first heard that this had gone down, the David Knight was pushing back on this

01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:54.180
stuff.

01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:55.180
I'm like, he is fired.

01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:56.180
Yeah.

01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:57.180
He is fucking fired.

01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:00.660
Then when I sat and thought about it a little bit more and recognize like, what are the

01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:02.260
dynamics here?

01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:03.940
I think David Knight's fine.

01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:04.940
Yeah.

01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:05.940
And I think they'll just pretend.

01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:06.940
Oh, and didn't do that.

01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:07.940
Yeah.

01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:12.220
They made a bad move, but it's like, that's an info wars mistake.

01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:13.940
It's an, it's the apprentice mistake.

01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:14.940
Yes.

01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:16.180
You know, of course you forgive the apprentice.

01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:17.180
That's how you learn.

01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:18.980
It's an info wars mistake too.

01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:20.220
It's in the world of info wars.

01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:24.740
You were chasing down a conspiracy, you know, like nine times out of 10, maybe it doesn't

01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:25.740
work.

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.220
That 10th time, maybe we make a million dollars.

01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.220
Exactly.

01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:29.220
So fine.

01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:30.220
We'll let you do that.

01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:31.660
It's embarrassing.

01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:33.200
Pretend you didn't do it.

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:34.300
Move along.

01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:35.300
Put Steve in timeout.

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:36.300
Right.

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:39.900
He's going to be gone for a little bit.

01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:42.180
He's not coming back before the inauguration.

01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:45.860
When I listened to this David Knight thing, first of all, I was like, wow, he is as boring

01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:46.900
as I remember.

01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:49.180
But then I was like, Oh yeah, no, no.

01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:51.340
He's doing what daddy needs him to do.

01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:55.500
He's doing the work of cleaning up this because the narrative needs to be that the fucking

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:56.920
election was stolen.

01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:00.760
You can't have it be that Trump did a sting operation.

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:02.200
That's going to fall apart.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:03.200
Real quick.

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.200
Oh boy.

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:05.200
Yeah.

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:06.200
David Knight had good instincts.

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.200
That's weird.

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:10.060
Uh, but it looked like it was like, you're fucking gone.

01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:12.100
Steve, Steve has got to be on the outs.

01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:14.340
He's got to have like at least had a talking to or something.

01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:15.340
This one's too nuts.

01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:16.340
Yeah.

01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:17.340
Yeah.

01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:20.740
That must've been a phone call of like, dude, dude, you can't be swinging that hard.

01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:21.740
Yeah.

01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:25.860
So David Knight, uh, before he gets down to business on, on Steve's nonsense, he, uh,

01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:29.300
I just wanted to play a couple of clips of his show just to be like, the tones of these

01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:31.740
things are so fucking different.

01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:39.260
Twitter permanently banned Steve Bannon because he called for, that's the way the daily mark

01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:40.620
of the beast puts it.

01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:46.700
Uh, he called for the beheading of dr Fauci and FBI director Christopher Ray.

01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:51.900
Well, here's what he actually had to say.

01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:53.940
I'd actually like to go back to the old times of tutor England.

01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:56.220
I'd put that their heads on pikes, right?

01:33:56.220 --> 01:34:00.260
I put them on two corners of the white house as a warning to federal bureaucrats.

01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:03.900
Now, this is what's known as a metaphor, I believe.

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:08.380
I always get that confused assemblies, but I believe it's a metaphor because he didn't

01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:13.100
use the word like, I think that is the, wow.

01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:14.460
What is this show?

01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:15.460
Exactly.

01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:18.940
I'm like, this is for grandparents or something sarcastic old man show.

01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:19.940
Yeah.

01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:23.060
Like this is, this is for people who need a little bit of a milder presentation to their

01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:28.700
extreme and their rationalizations of, of people saying fucked up things.

01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:31.780
Oh, these people, they're not going to cut off heads.

01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:33.820
It's a metaphor.

01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:38.940
Also, I will say that David Knight likes to make jokes.

01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:48.020
All right, Nancy Pelosi has announced a big expansion of COVID testing for lawmakers.

01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:50.660
Well, I saw this and saw testing, testing.

01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:53.940
Well, I knew it wasn't going to be polygraph testing.

01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:57.140
Now that would be funny.

01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:58.660
Wow.

01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:00.540
That was actually almost charming.

01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:02.300
I was almost a little charmed by that.

01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:03.900
Yeah, because you know what that was?

01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:04.900
That was...

01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:06.740
Grandpa laughed at his own joke.

01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:07.740
And it had joke structure.

01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:08.740
Yeah, it did.

01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:09.740
It had structure.

01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:10.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:11.740
It wasn't funny.

01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:14.180
No good God though.

01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:15.180
But it had structure.

01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:18.580
Unlike so many of the things that Alex thinks are jokes that are just like maybe something

01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:20.420
that's off color or offensive.

01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:21.420
Yeah.

01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:22.420
No, no, no.

01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:24.780
It's, it's grandpa at Thanksgiving and you're like, that was great.

01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:26.620
You didn't say anything about black lives matter.

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:27.860
We're having a great time.

01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:32.100
We didn't bring up how much you love Song of the South this time, David.

01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:33.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:34.100
Yeah.

01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:37.520
So yeah, I thought that was so bizarre.

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:41.280
Like I was looking at that, I'm like, this is InfoWars.

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.740
He just made a joke and laughed at it.

01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:45.620
And that laugh did not seem fake.

01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:48.820
And did not use any old timey slurs in the process.

01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:50.140
Very bizarre.

01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:55.780
So it took a while and a lot of boring shit to get through, but we get to David talking

01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:58.780
about Steve Puchenik's story.

01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:03.500
But you'll notice that the way he's talking about it, he's very careful to talk about

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:10.420
it as a story that's being posted on Reason.com as opposed to an interview his coworker had

01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:12.420
done the day before.

01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:13.420
Find me a little thread.

01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:16.000
Trump's likeliest path appears to be narrower.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:21.340
He needs to hang on to both Pennsylvania and Georgia and he also needs to overtake Biden

01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:24.020
in either Nevada or Arizona.

01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:26.420
So that's where we are at the moment.

01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:29.480
But of course we know that this is all rigged.

01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:35.500
We know that it was all baked in, which is why I just about fell out of my chair when

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:38.140
I saw this headline from Reason Magazine.

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:40.500
Not when you were watching The War Room the day before.

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:41.500
He doesn't watch The War Room.

01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.500
I wouldn't.

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:47.940
So one thing I think is really interesting is that David Knight, his approach on it is

01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:51.860
very much like, this makes no sense.

01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:53.420
That's unfair.

01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:55.580
I appreciate it.

01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:58.780
To me, if this was a sting, it doesn't even make any sense.

01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:01.500
It's another one of these deals like the laptop with Hunter Biden.

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:05.060
They waited to the very last minute to put that thing out thinking it was going to be

01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:06.060
a surprise.

01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:10.660
And then everybody just said, well, it's not credible, but media is going to put out the

01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:11.660
narrative that's not credible.

01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:14.340
It doesn't matter if you've got documents, doesn't matter if you've got photographic

01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:15.340
evidence.

01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:18.620
You can have all the documentation that you want in the world and they're not going to

01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:21.700
believe it because the mainstream media and social media are going to censor you and they're

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:23.580
going to put out their narrative.

01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:30.780
So I don't see that's going to do anything other than to create a forest fire.

01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:35.100
But the point he's trying to make, I would take issue with one little tweak.

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:39.540
I'd make one little tweak, but it doesn't make sense because no one would believe this

01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:40.540
anyway.

01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:41.540
No, there is that.

01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:42.540
That makes sense.

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:45.700
But his version of it is no one would believe it because the media would put out their own

01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:46.700
version.

01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:47.700
I don't agree with that.

01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:48.700
No, totally.

01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:50.760
I would say that everyone would be like, oh, fuck yourself.

01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:51.760
That is true.

01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:55.700
Probably if that story came out, people would just not believe it.

01:37:55.700 --> 01:38:01.680
Wait, so he's saying that it is true, but that the media wouldn't believe it anyways?

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.020
He's saying that they wouldn't do it because no one would believe it even if they did it.

01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:07.020
Oh, okay.

01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:08.020
I got you now.

01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:09.220
Basically, I think is what his point is.

01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:10.620
He's not saying that it happened.

01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:15.980
He's saying that they would have seen that happening ahead of time and not done the plan.

01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:19.780
The plan would have been fucked by no one believing it, so they wouldn't have gone down

01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:20.780
that road to begin with.

01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:21.780
Sure.

01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:22.780
That makes sense.

01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:23.780
Sure.

01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:24.780
I guess.

01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:25.780
I mean, however you get there is how you get there.

01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:26.780
I don't know.

01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:27.780
It doesn't make sense.

01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:28.780
No, no, no, no.

01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:29.780
Absolutely not.

01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:32.020
If that's your reason why it doesn't make sense, you work at Infowars.

01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:33.020
Whatever.

01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:34.020
Fine.

01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:39.780
Now, in this last clip, he doesn't talk about it that much, but Steve does say something

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:40.780
that I think is great.

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:42.780
Do you mean David Knight?

01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:43.780
Yes.

01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:44.780
About Steve.

01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:45.780
Gotcha.

01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:50.540
David Knight says this thing that I think it's great, but also it's a classic Infowars

01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:55.140
thing where you're right, but you're wrong.

01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:56.140
You're right.

01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:57.140
Yes.

01:38:57.140 --> 01:38:58.140
But you are so wrong.

01:38:58.140 --> 01:38:59.140
Ah, the paradox.

01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:00.140
Look, I didn't jump into Pizzagate.

01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:04.420
I don't allow Pechenik to come on this show because last time he came on this show was

01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:06.780
right after the shooting in Vegas.

01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:12.380
He came on this show to sell the lie that nobody died in Vegas because he's trying to

01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:14.020
trap me.

01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:20.060
This guy is a CIA shill and he comes on to trap us.

01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:23.580
That's one of the ways that they discredit you.

01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:25.300
I'm not having anything to do with that.

01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:26.300
We'll be right back.

01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:27.300
Stay with us.

01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:34.140
So, David's right that Steve is a fucking liar and he fucks with Infowars because he's

01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:38.600
in a unique position where he seems to be able to get away with it and he causes a lot

01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:39.600
of chaos.

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.600
He has a great time.

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.260
And I do believe that that is correct.

01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:46.460
I remember that episode where Steve was on with David Knight and he was talking about

01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:52.380
the Las Vegas shooting being fake and David Knight's reaction to that was, I agree with

01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:55.300
you that Sandy Hook was fake, but not this one.

01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:56.300
Yeah, I remember.

01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:59.260
That was even one where you pulled that clip from David Knight.

01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:00.260
I have that clip somewhere.

01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.580
That's how important that was to you.

01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:03.820
I have it in a folder somewhere.

01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:06.980
But I do agree with him.

01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:07.980
Don't have Steve on.

01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:09.740
It's a great thing you have that rule.

01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:11.980
Now, he's not a CIA shill.

01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:12.980
No.

01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:13.980
He's a bored man.

01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:14.980
Uh huh.

01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:15.980
In a condo in Florida.

01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:16.980
You got it.

01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:17.980
Who wants to fuck with you?

01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:24.700
I don't understand how one out of three Infowars hosts is just like, this guy's a CIA shill

01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:29.060
who's trying to destroy our entire business and the other two are like, eh, come on, have

01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:30.060
a, come on in.

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:34.500
Not only is he not a CIA shill, he is the best.

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:35.500
Right.

01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:36.500
Exactly.

01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:37.500
Yeah.

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:38.500
Yeah.

01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:42.140
If he's a CIA shill, he's tricked me.

01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:43.140
Oh.

01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:44.140
Oh shit.

01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:49.260
But here's, here's where this becomes a little bit less like of a severe problem because

01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:54.220
that does seem like a problem for like David Knight to be on air being like, Steve Pechenik

01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:58.980
is a CIA shill who's trying to trap me with these bullshit stories and that's how they

01:40:58.980 --> 01:40:59.980
get you.

01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:01.740
Going all the way back to Las Vegas.

01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:02.740
Right.

01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:03.740
Yeah.

01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:04.740
A long time.

01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:07.940
He's been on Alex's show since then saying a bunch of nonsense.

01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:12.700
And so by that token, David would have to think that he's trying to trap Alex.

01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:13.700
It would only make sense.

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:18.700
And somehow that's fine to still work at the same place where that is going on.

01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:22.420
Or, or he's only trying to trap David Knight.

01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:23.420
David Knight is the white whale.

01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:25.540
He's the one that Steve is trying to get rid of.

01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:27.540
He's the big prize.

01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:28.540
Yeah.

01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:30.260
Uh, I don't think that's the case.

01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:33.620
I don't think anybody's particularly focused on David Knight.

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:34.620
That's probably true.

01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:39.020
Um, but here's the thing, Alex has done this too.

01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:40.020
Yeah.

01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:45.300
Like after the Las Vegas shooting, Alex did turn on Steve for a little while and he did

01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:50.540
say to a caller, I think Steve is still working for the CIA and he's fucking with us.

01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:51.540
Yep.

01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:55.300
And then they made their peace after a couple months of Steve being on timeout.

01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:57.380
So that's probably what'll happen again.

01:41:57.380 --> 01:41:58.380
Most likely.

01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:01.340
Although it's pretty funny.

01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:02.340
It's very funny.

01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:04.740
It's, it's really funny.

01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:11.820
And I think that the image of Owen being like, fuck you mainstream media, we're destroying

01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:12.820
you.

01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:16.940
That's the image of Info Wars 2020 election that I want to hold onto.

01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:22.700
And I want to remember, I want that to be sort of the spiritual energy that we're coming

01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:27.100
with as opposed to, you know, laughing at, oh, you lost.

01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:28.100
Yeah.

01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:29.740
I don't, I don't want to laugh at you for losing.

01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:34.900
I want to be glad that your candidate lost cause I hate the policies.

01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:38.100
But I want to laugh at you for taunting the mainstream media because you got tricked by

01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:39.100
Steve.

01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:40.160
So good.

01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:41.160
So good.

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:44.080
You, and you will get tricked again.

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:50.020
You think you're so smart and you think that Steve gave you a scoop.

01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:51.020
Yeah.

01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:53.980
If you got it, it's not a scoop.

01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:58.500
Steve's compliment to you.

01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:00.460
That guy worked for the CIA.

01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:03.380
He killed everybody.

01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:13.260
If you have Steve in 20 goddamn telling you that he chose your show, if he even smiled

01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:15.460
at me, I'm throwing a fastball at him.

01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:16.460
Yes.

01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:17.460
Something is up.

01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:18.460
Yeah.

01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:20.980
If he, if he wants to talk to you, he wants to use you.

01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:21.980
Right.

01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:22.980
Oh man.

01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:23.980
He's not a CIA shell.

01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:26.700
Oh, and oh, and really stop and think.

01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:33.380
If, if Steve was coming with big stuff this close to the election, this important a time

01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:38.700
period for, I guess, overthrowing the government, Alex isn't giving it to you.

01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:42.660
Oh, and I mean, it's not relative audience size is huge.

01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:45.660
It's a very big difference, a little bit of a difference.

01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:46.660
And yeah.

01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:47.660
Okay.

01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:48.660
I'm Steve.

01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:53.940
I got this big information that the election was actually secretly a sting operation.

01:43:53.940 --> 01:44:04.700
I can't get permission to talk about it an hour early.

01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:05.700
I'm sorry.

01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:06.700
They had it on a clock.

01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:07.700
They had it on a clock.

01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:08.700
It was 4 PM.

01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:09.700
Eastern time.

01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:10.700
Shit.

01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:11.700
I could have done it at three.

01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:15.540
I mean, if you're Owen, you always got to be looking for reasons to think that you're

01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:18.540
like relevant and doing good work.

01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:19.540
Sure.

01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:23.140
Every now and again, you got to go yell at Congress and get walked out or something like

01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:24.140
that.

01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:26.020
You got to get, you got to get a high.

01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:29.920
And I guess if, you know, it's believing Steve is what does it for you.

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:30.920
Sometimes it's got to do.

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:34.580
Hey, everybody needs a little juice from here from here from time to pick yourself back

01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:37.100
up and get back on track.

01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:39.500
Don't don't quit, quit.

01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:40.860
This is so embarrassing.

01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:42.160
You should quit.

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:43.160
You should quit.

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:50.420
You said fudge you mainstream media because Steve Pachek told you that the entire election

01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:51.780
was a sting operation.

01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:53.260
It was an elaborate ruse.

01:44:53.260 --> 01:44:54.260
Oh boy.

01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:55.260
Uh, yeah.

01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:57.700
So this is episode 500, Jordan.

01:44:57.700 --> 01:44:58.700
Dan?

01:44:58.700 --> 01:44:59.700
Yep.

01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:00.700
500 episodes, huh?

01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:01.700
Quite a few.

01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:02.700
That's weird.

01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:03.700
Uh huh.

01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:04.700
This is how we celebrate.

01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:05.700
Yeah.

01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:06.700
Yeah.

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:07.700
That's about right.

01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:08.700
This, this is how we celebrate.

01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:09.700
Okay.

01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:18.420
Ladies and gentlemen, we're back in the Infowars war room devastating the fake news media today

01:45:18.420 --> 01:45:21.420
with Dr. Steve Pachek.

01:45:21.420 --> 01:45:23.780
I want to talk more about that clip.

01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:24.780
Uh huh.

01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:25.780
I love it for so many reasons.

01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:26.780
Yeah.

01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:30.980
First of all, you've got that sort of new metal base going behind it, which is great.

01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:32.220
It's setting the tone nicely.

01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:33.580
Oh, that's a six string bass.

01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:34.580
You can tell.

01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:37.860
We're devastating the fake news media.

01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:44.300
Fake news media is what's being devastated with Steve Pachek while we talk bullshit.

01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:47.360
Does Owen work for the CIA?

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:48.900
My eyes just got really wide.

01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:49.900
Right?

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:52.180
I've broken some serious news to you, Dan.

01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:53.740
You know where the CIA is based?

01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:54.740
Where?

01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:55.740
St. Louis.

01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:56.740
All right.

01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:59.740
I don't think it is, but that's where Owen's from.

01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:03.780
Anyway, we'll be back for episode five Oh one indeed.

01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:05.500
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:06.500
We do have a website.

01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:07.500
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:08.500
Yeah.

01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:09.500
We're also on Twitter.

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:10.500
We are on Twitter.

01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:11.500
It's at knowledge, under quite an act.

01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:12.500
Go to bet.

01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:13.500
Jordan was on Facebook review.

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:18.740
And if you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area of the fights.

01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:19.740
Not over.

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:20.740
Yep.

01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:21.740
We'll be back.

01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:22.740
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:23.740
I'm Leo.

01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:24.740
I'm DZX Clark.

01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:26.380
I am Daryl Rundis.

01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:31.340
I'm devastating the fake news media with Steve Fagampagenic.

01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:32.340
Andy in Kansas.

01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:33.340
You're on the air.

01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:34.340
Thanks for holding.

01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:35.340
Hello, Alex.

01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:36.340
I'm a first time caller.

01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:37.340
I'm a huge fan.

01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:38.340
I love your work.

01:46:38.340 --> 01:47:06.340
I love you.
