00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,880
N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,120
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,280
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys, knowledge

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,280
fight.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,040
Dan and Jordan, knowledge fight.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,280
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her, riddle her, riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,480
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and, stop it, Andy and, Andy and, Andy and, it's time

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,480
to pray.

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,480
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us.

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,280
Hello Alex, I'm a fifth-time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,440
Knowledgefight.com, knowledgefight.com, I love you.

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,360
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan, I'm Jordan, we're a couple of dudes

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,400
that like to sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Jones.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Oh indeed we are Dan.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Jordan.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Dan.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Jordan.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
I have a quick question for you.

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Sure.

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
What's your bright spot today?

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,360
My bright spot today, now spoiler alert to everybody out there listening, we just recorded

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,440
our bright spots and realized that it was not recorded.

26
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,440
Had not started the recording yet.

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
The thing had not recorded.

28
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
It's crucially recorded.

29
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
I hit the button.

30
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
It didn't start recording.

31
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
I'm not saying that I didn't.

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
And it didn't start recording.

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
I'm not saying that I disbelieve you.

34
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,000
So we're gonna share our bright spots with each other for a second time, so if any of

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
this sounds insincere.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's a little bit weird to do it twice in a row.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There were some great rips.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Totally.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You guys missed out on gold.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,920
And now I feel like I can't bring any, oh god.

42
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,040
No, it's tough to bring the same energy now.

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
I know.

44
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,160
Anyway, my bright spot is world music.

45
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,240
Actually, on the second time that is funnier.

46
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
Yeah.

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
It's not that funny.

48
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,840
I'm just worried, like I told you earlier on the first time, that I'm worried that I'm

49
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,400
becoming my parents, because they used to have a lot of interest in a lot of music from

50
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,840
around the world, particularly this band, Yuthu Yindi, which is a lot of synth and also

51
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,720
tribal sounds from Oceania.

52
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:20,080
And yeah, it was a running joke throughout our family, but I was on Spotify getting some

53
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,400
work done for the episode.

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,360
Just like to put on music in the background while I'm like researching and reading up

55
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
on stuff.

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,880
And I always like to let them see what you got.

58
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,520
They know what I've listened to.

59
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,520
Let's see if you can hit a home run.

60
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't trust nobody.

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And there was some music from Malawi that ended up coming up, and I really, really enjoyed

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
it.

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,080
And I'm worried this is going to set me off on a path of just like getting into all sorts

64
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,800
of stuff from around the world, which isn't the worst thing ever.

65
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Nothing.

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
No, no, no.

67
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Orchestra Baobab is great.

68
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
You should try them out.

69
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
They're fantastic.

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Writing this down.

71
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,880
Yeah, there's all kinds of great African music.

72
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,160
I think it's a little bit cliche to reference them because they're probably...

73
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,160
Or maybe not.

74
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,840
Maybe no one has any idea about them except for in the weird circles that I live in.

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
That might be.

76
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,760
Oh, it's so cliche to reference Orchestra Baobab.

77
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
You know the thing everyone knows about.

78
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,320
Well, I mean, on one of our bonus episodes, we did talk about your love of really obscure

79
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
music.

80
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,000
So you can't tell who knows what.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,320
I have no idea.

82
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
Yeah.

83
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,600
Yeah, so this might be a new little bit of an auditory adventure for me.

84
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,880
I'm excited to embark on it and find out what the rest of the world has to offer in terms

85
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
of sounds.

86
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,480
A lot of great music out there.

87
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
Awesome.

88
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
What about you?

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,480
What's your bright spot?

90
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,120
My bright spot, Dan, is Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

91
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,400
It's a fantastic game.

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
I enjoyed it.

93
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,680
I want to say that I already knew that the first time around.

94
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,640
You already knew that before I had even said it the first time.

95
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Right.

96
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
Now it's the second time I'm totally not surprised.

97
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
Twice as boring.

98
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
Twice as boring.

99
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
Not bored.

100
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Not interested.

101
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
Just not surprised.

102
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
You even already know the story that my bright spot is, so it's not even an interesting story.

103
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,640
But I also knew that because you texted me about it before the first time we recorded

104
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
it.

105
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Exactly.

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
All of this is terrible for you.

107
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
You're bored by it.

108
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
Please.

109
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
My bright spot is a video game.

110
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
Is that what you wanted to hear, Dan?

111
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,440
No, I'm thrilled for you, because it's been a long time coming.

112
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,040
You're very excited about this game, as you should be.

113
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,520
Yeah, it's my favorite series.

114
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,440
And I had originally ordered it.

115
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,680
I found out on the 9th that my copy wouldn't have rised.

116
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,520
I ordered a physical copy, like a boron, and it wouldn't have rised.

117
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,160
Well, you're a man of a certain age.

118
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
It wouldn't have rised.

119
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,440
Yes, I have reached that time.

120
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,680
Your console age, your cartridge age, game cartridge age.

121
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,560
I still blow on the DVDs, just in case.

122
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Smart.

123
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

124
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
It's very smart.

125
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Yeah, no, and it wasn't going to show up until the 17th, so on the 9th I was like, fuck this.

126
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,680
It was 7 o'clock.

127
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,760
It was going to be available at 11.

128
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,160
So I scrambled and got the download copy as soon as I possibly could, and all troubles

129
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
were averted.

130
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
It's perfect.

131
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Yeah, you got to.

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
I mean, it's going to be another week for that thing to show up.

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
No, can't do it.

134
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
Can't do it.

135
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
Yeah.

136
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,160
No, no, no.

137
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
People are going to say stuff like, it was good.

138
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
Spoilers.

139
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Yeah, and I'm like, no.

140
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,520
I must experience it fresh.

141
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,860
I must be part of the zeitgeist.

142
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:13,160
So I've been busy, because the show and what have you, and sort of other related projects,

143
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,080
and so I haven't had a lot of time to play it, but I did pre-order a digital copy myself,

144
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,320
and I did play a little bit.

145
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Like a genius.

146
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
I played a little bit the other night.

147
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,720
I've not gotten very far into it, and I'm concerned.

148
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,320
Now here's why.

149
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,760
I don't know a lot about Norse and Viking stuff, whereas other iterations of the game

150
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,480
were like sort of mythologies and cultural histories that I know a little bit more about.

151
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,200
Greece is your wheelhouse.

152
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Like right up your alley.

153
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,020
Even the one before it was Egypt, and I know a bit about Egyptian history.

154
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,080
I know very little, and I realized why.

155
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,280
It's those letters.

156
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
It's the letters.

157
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
The ruins.

158
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,300
No, I just can't handle the weird combination of letters and the names and stuff.

159
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:06,360
It intimidates me, and I don't know what to do with those Vs and Js and Ys and Gs everywhere.

160
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
It scares me.

161
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
I don't know what to do.

162
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
Ah, come on.

163
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
It's fine.

164
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
It's hard.

165
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
It's Elvish.

166
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
You're fine.

167
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,320
It's very difficult for me, and I realize that subconscious bias has kept me away, whereas

168
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,040
I'm excited to embark on a little bit of this, find out some stuff that I can then maybe

169
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,360
read up on the real versions of.

170
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
And then I also-

171
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,160
I think what's really funny about that is having played just a little bit further into

172
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,320
the game than you, after the title card, which is four hours, five hours into that-

173
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,920
I've not even come close to that, I'm sure.

174
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
You go to England.

175
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
What?

176
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Spoilers.

177
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
All of your worries-

178
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Spoilers.

179
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,280
It's funny to me that you're like, oh, I'm worried about the ruins, and I'm like, dude,

180
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,660
three hours from now you won't even see a ruin.

181
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
You're fine.

182
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
Wow.

183
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,660
I'm a little disappointed.

184
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,660
No, it's going to be great.

185
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,660
It's awesome.

186
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:57,640
But the other thing, that actually kind of puts to bed my other worry about the game,

187
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,400
having again played very little of it, I'm worried it's too white, but not in white people

188
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
way.

189
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Sure, sure, sure.

190
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
I mean snow.

191
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
It's very snow.

192
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,280
There's so much goddamn snow around, it's visually monochromatic to a level that if

193
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,840
it were the entire game, I would have a problem with that.

194
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,880
I think it would be a difficulty.

195
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,280
Because of the open world exploration aspect, if you're just running around and everywhere

196
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,960
is snow covered, it becomes a bummer.

197
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,560
No, even with Witcher 3, it wasn't gloomy all the time, it was gloomy most of the time.

198
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
And there were sort of variations to the gloom.

199
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

200
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,240
There's light gloom, dark gloom, you got them.

201
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,920
Well, I'm glad to know that some of these concerns that I have, whether it be letter

202
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
or snow-based.

203
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Or weather, yeah.

204
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,760
Letter or weather, it's still a good game.

205
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:51,880
I trust the developers of those games enough to not make a game that's all snow.

206
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,040
I figured it would be such an elementary kind of thing.

207
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,440
Rogue was, did you ever play Assassin's Creed Rogue?

208
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
I did not.

209
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, that one's mainly snow, so you skipped that one for good.

210
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Skip it.

211
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, skip it.

212
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That one's out of here.

213
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't mind a little snow.

214
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Anyway.

215
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You live in Illinois, you don't mind a little snow.

216
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
A little bit.

217
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I live through snowpocalypse.

218
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,840
Yeah, we've been here, wow, come on.

219
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,960
So Jordan, today we're getting back into the present, we're going to be talking about November

220
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
7th and 8th, 2020.

221
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
I'm Dan, this is 2020.

222
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,320
Oh, god damn it.

223
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,840
We're entering that interesting period where we find out what Alex does during the 79 days

224
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
of hell.

225
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

226
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,480
On our last episode, we experienced what happened when Alex left and Steve Pachanik tried to

227
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,720
throw a wrench in the gears.

228
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:44,240
Today we jump in and I guess we're just pretending none of this shit happened.

229
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,960
I was born in 1783, my father was a Highlander and so am I.

230
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,200
I had to kill him, there can be only one!

231
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,360
I don't know exactly how we're doing it, but I guess we're just pretending that never happened.

232
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,420
And we're here on Saturday, Alex is doing a broadcast on Saturday the 7th and then his

233
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,560
show on Sunday the 8th.

234
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,880
And yeah, we'll see, we'll see what's going on.

235
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Alright.

236
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
He's a weird dude.

237
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
I like it.

238
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
Yeah.

239
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
I like it.

240
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,360
But before we get down to business on that, let's take a moment to say thank you to some

241
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360

Thank you, Philbin.

266
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,560
And then finally, I'd like to give a shout out to a couple of folks who donated on an

267
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
elevated level.

268
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,620
We appreciate that very much.

269
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,160
So first of all, HB.

270
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
Thank you so much.

271
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
You are now a technocrat.

272
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,440
Fernando F. Thank you so much.

273
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,640
You are now a technocrat.

274
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,480
And don't go into the forest.

275
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Thank you so much.

276
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
You are now a technocrat.

277
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
I'm a policy wonk.

278
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Crikey, mate.

279
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
That's fantastic.

280
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Have yourself a brew.

281
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,480
Thank you.

282
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,480
How's your 401k doing, bro?

283
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
All right.

284
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson.

285
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
All right.

286
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
Let's just get down to business.

287
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

288
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,400
Why are you pimps so good?

289
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,040
My neck is freakishly large.

290
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,720
I declare info war on you.

291
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Thanks so much, HB.

292
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Thanks so much, Fernando.

293
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Thank you so much.

294
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Don't go into the forest.

295
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Yes.

296
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Thank you very much.

297
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
All of you.

298
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,240
I would like to, first of all, encourage anybody to have a donor name that is an ominous warning.

299
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Oh, yeah.

300
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
I enjoy that.

301
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Which forest?

302
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
Exactly.

303
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
That's an issue.

304
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,160
If you're out there listening and thinking, hey, I enjoy this show, I'd like to support

305
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
these gents.

306
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,640
You can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com, clicking the button that says support the

307
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
show.

308
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
We would appreciate it.

309
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,240
We would love it, but do not go to Schwarzwandt.

310
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
That's the Black Forest.

311
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Oh, okay.

312
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

313
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
What else could people do?

314
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,720
Well, you know what, Dan?

315
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:12,680
Some people could absolutely be filled with that generous spirit and want to give or donate

316
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,160
to someone, but then realize that they would have to wait a week to deal with that.

317
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Oh, yeah.

318
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,240
You just can't wait a week because the generous spirit is so strong within you.

319
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,760
Find a way to get that money out now, Dan.

320
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,760
To a local charity.

321
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
Yeah, exactly.

322
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Yeah, yeah.

323
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
Nailed it.

324
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Thanks, Dan.

325
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,200
I was worried it was going to end in Yggdrasil or some nonsense.

326
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,480
Not that that's nonsense, but whatever.

327
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
You know what I'm saying.

328
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Sure, I get you.

329
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,360
So, Jordan, before we begin, here's an out of context drop from today's show.

330
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:48,160
I mean, it's like when you watch Dancing with the Stars in the final episode or whatever,

331
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,280
because I'm not a big TV guy, but I do like watching good looking women dance.

332
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,800
And when it's cool to watch the guys and all of it, it's really cool.

333
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,240
It's cool to see celebrities dance.

334
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
I mean, it's fun.

335
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Okay.

336
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,240
You can't.

337
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,400
You don't need to justify why you watch a TV show.

338
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,640
This is a problem with being on the far right.

339
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,320
You can't just enjoy what you enjoy.

340
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,240
You have to fight for it.

341
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
Yeah.

342
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,320
I got tricked because Sean Spicer was on, and I watched it, and hey, some of the chicks

343
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
were hot.

344
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Whatever.

345
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,800
Actually, I don't even like the dancing at all.

346
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,800
The way that they get pirouette, and the throws, and the...

347
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,080
It seems unmanly for me to enjoy watching people dance.

348
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,080
Exactly.

349
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,080
Isn't that what he just said?

350
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
More or less.

351
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
That's exactly what he just said.

352
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,080
Yeah, it's so sad.

353
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,320
I'm insecure about watching dance.

354
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,720
Enjoy what you enjoy.

355
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Right?

356
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
Anyway, here we go.

357
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,000
We're jumping in on the seventh Saturday.

358
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Alex's day off.

359
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Sure.

360
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah.

361
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,080
Back from his trip to Phoenix, where he yelled into an adult-sized bullhorn, and, hey, man,

362
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,960
if Biden's really president, which it looks like he is, Alex has bad news.

363
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
Uh-oh.

364
00:12:52,960 --> 00:13:00,040
It is Saturday, November 7th, the year is 2020, and if we accept the false claims of

365
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,120
Joe Biden and his communist Chinese deep state handlers that he is the president with the

366
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:10,120
fraud we've just witnessed, then you could really see this as a good day to put on the

367
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:21,040
Republic's tombstone, born July 4th, 1776, died November 7th, 2020.

368
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
That's what this is.

369
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,800
Alex has called it Death of America, November 7th, 2020.

370
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:34,480
As a millionaire, I can tell you that the tragedy of the Biden administration will be

371
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,960
that they raised the marginal income tax on individuals making over $500,000 a year to

372
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,120
above 35%, Dan, and that is the end of the Republic.

373
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
What's that I hear?

374
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,120
I think that's the church bells ringing for the funeral of America.

375
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
That's it.

376
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
It's going to go back up to 44%.

377
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
Yeah.

378
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,040
Can you imagine how angry 2 Chainz is going to be then?

379
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
So mad.

380
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
He's so mad.

381
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,040
In this next clip, we learn, look, this is the problem that I have.

382
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,160
He starts off the show talking about put this date on America's tombstone.

383
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
Sure.

384
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Then he says things like this.

385
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,240
And we can talk all day about the failures of Trump and why this was able to happen.

386
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,000
We can talk about what Trump should have done better, and we're going to do that so we don't

387
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,240
make the mistakes next time.

388
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
What next time?

389
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,480
What the fuck next time?

390
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,760
According to Alex, there is no next time.

391
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,920
This isn't just a political party that you disagree with that now has control of the

392
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,680
executive branch of the government.

393
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,920
This is the fucking devil taking over.

394
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,760
Without Trump there to stop them, the story is supposed to be that there's nothing to

395
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,320
protect the Patriots from getting rounded up and the entire world being killed off with

396
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,400
a super bio weapon, a false flag ice age, or maybe nukes, depending on what Alex is

397
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
feeling that day.

398
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,640
Chicago's gone for sure.

399
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,840
It's downright insulting for Alex to have the nerve to act like a political commentator

400
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,200
right now when his candidate has been projected to lose.

401
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,880
He has this tantrum about the death of the Republic being on November 7th and immediately

402
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,340
gets into the mode you'd expect to see on regular outlets.

403
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,880
They're doing a post mortem on the campaign.

404
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,520
Where were the flaws in the strategy?

405
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,800
Where is there room for improvements?

406
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,880
We can do better next time.

407
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,200
Let's talk midterms.

408
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,380
Normal people get to do that because they don't live in an artificial reality they use

409
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,920
to abuse their audiences, where if their guy loses the election, pedophile demons will

410
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,480
run the street and God's fire filled judgment will be upon us.

411
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,680
Alex doesn't get to wargame about the midterms.

412
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,280
He lost that right when he made the terms of this election supernatural.

413
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:32,840
Yeah I believe it was if Biden wins, they're going to switch to plan B and kill all of

414
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
us immediately.

415
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,400
They're not even going to give us the three years?

416
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,240
That wasn't even conditional on the election.

417
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,520
That was just something Alex said they'd decided to do because Alex is too effective.

418
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
He was in a bad mood.

419
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
I gotcha.

420
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,320
The Infowar is too strong so they're gonna just kill us off instead of the fun ordered

421
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,680
killing us off that they like to do because the devil loves plans.

422
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,600
I don't even think that's, you know what, there's nothing to be ashamed about in losing

423
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
to the devil.

424
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,880
You're supposed to lose to the devil.

425
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,160
The only person who wins against the devil is Jesus, man.

426
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Well, and Johnny.

427
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Oh well, Johnny does too.

428
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,720
He rosined up that bow and played his fiddle hard.

429
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
I gotcha.

430
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
So we got two.

431
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Yeah.

432
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
Alright.

433
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,880
And Johnny was really a Christ metaphor.

434
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,480
And honestly, it was more of a single issue thing.

435
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,560
That wasn't a real, like, he wasn't trying to change the whole world.

436
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
Right.

437
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,040
It was really just about fiddle playing.

438
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,560
It was mainly fiddling, yes.

439
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,200
The devil acts with honor in fiddle contests.

440
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,040
Well, if you count, like, the other ripoff songs of The Devil Went Down to Georgia, then

441
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,300
I think some other people might have been the devil too, because there's other versions.

442
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,440
There was at least one juggler who went down to Georgia.

443
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,960
Our friend Marty DeRosa informed me of the song, like, The Devil Went Down to Detroit,

444
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
I think.

445
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
I believe that's the name of it.

446
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
It's like a rap version.

447
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Sure.

448
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,760
And these guys have, like, a DJ contest with the devil.

449
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
I think they win.

450
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
Okay.

451
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
I don't know.

452
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,440
Look, a lot of people may have fictitiously beat the devil.

453
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
But look.

454
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
I'm sort of saying it.

455
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,480
There's no shame in that.

456
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,600
You're not supposed to beat the devil.

457
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Right.

458
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Why are you beating yourself up over this?

459
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,360
I don't know if he's beating himself up by it.

460
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Oh, that's fair.

461
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,340
I want to stress one of the compelling reasons not to respect Alex Jones.

462
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,300
He is an intellectual coward.

463
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,400
He can't stand to be wrong to such a ridiculous extent that he set up this election as a battle

464
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,600
between good and evil, which evil could not possibly win.

465
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,100
And even if they did, good secretly actually won because evil cheated in a way that's never

466
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,720
going to be proven.

467
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,800
Now that the supposedly evil side has won, Alex won't even stick to his own parameters

468
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,880
and act like the literal devil just beat his hero.

469
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,920
Alex doesn't even have the integrity to present for a minute that any of the stuff he was

470
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,560
screaming about and fake crying about on air means anything.

471
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,700
Because it's time to move on and learn the lessons of the last election and apply them

472
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,400
to whatever white supremacist he supports next time because they insist they're just

473
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
a nationalist.

474
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,880
He's a child.

475
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,360
This more than many other moments is a very clear and unmistakable instance of retreat.

476
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,160
Get the fuck out of here with that learning lessons for next time shit.

477
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,680
You don't get to do that.

478
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Nope.

479
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
Nope.

480
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
Other people get to do that.

481
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,680
I resent that.

482
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,160
Honestly, there are very few situations where I don't think now that many of these people

483
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,720
are private citizens, we should spit on them every single time they go outside.

484
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,240
Like there's no way Alex should not be spit on regularly.

485
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:15,040
There's no way that like fucking, if Trump walks down fucking a street in Manhattan,

486
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,680
he should be spit on by thousands of people on a constant daily basis.

487
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Yeah.

488
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,720
I think that you could make an argument that spitting is a form of assault and maybe I'm

489
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,840
not into that.

490
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
Fair.

491
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
Yelling is better.

492
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,120
I'll go with you as far as yelling.

493
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,280
You'll go with me as far as yelling.

494
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Tiny bullhorning.

495
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
All right.

496
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,280
Okay.

497
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
Tiny bullhorning.

498
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
Tiny bullhorning.

499
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
Anytime Alex leaves his house, people, a crew of-

500
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,720
He should be surrounded with tiny bullhorners.

501
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,280
I think they're, I think you're right.

502
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
Yes.

503
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,680
The spitting on people I think is a little bit gross.

504
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,520
Well, now it's definitely attempted murder.

505
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
Certainly in an age of COVID.

506
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

507
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
That's fair.

508
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,240
You know, you don't want to sort of express support for that kind of behavior.

509
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,240
Right.

510
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
Right, right, right.

511
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Aim away from him.

512
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
Yeah.

513
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
Yelling with a tiny bullhorn through your mask.

514
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,240
I like it.

515
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
I like it.

516
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
That's perfectly-

517
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
That's safe.

518
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
Yeah.

519
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
I think that's-

520
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
I think that's good.

521
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
That's the middle ground.

522
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
What I'm saying is these people should be hounded to the ends of the earth.

523
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,240
Yeah.

524
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
Yeah.

525
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Bark at people through bullhorns.

526
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
Yeah.

527
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
I like it.

528
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,120
So Alex has a concern that a lot of his, you know, everyone's getting censored.

529
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
Everyone's getting kicked off.

530
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,720
All the patriots are being taken off all social media platforms.

531
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
Sure.

532
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,480
And you see the mass censorship now, as we predicted, almost total censorship.

533
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,680
No media that I saw carrying Giuliani's press conference.

534
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,220
Thank God there's right side broadcasting.

535
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,280
Thank God there's info wars picking it back up.

536
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,200
Thank God you're out there amplifying it.

537
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,800
But this is a serious war.

538
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,320
So yeah, man, everyone's getting taken down, except for people like info wars and right

539
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,800
side broadcasting that'll stand up and cover Rudy Giuliani's wonderful press conference.

540
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Somebody's gotta-

541
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,000
I would suspect that most media outlets, if they didn't, they didn't cover Rudy Giuliani's

542
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,800
press conference out of respect for him, since that shit was super embarrassing.

543
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,640
Also, it wasn't censored.

544
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,720
People were making fun of it all over the place.

545
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Yeah.

546
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,020
This was, of course, the Four Seasons press conference.

547
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,600
As best as anyone can tell, someone in the campaign may have thought that they booked

548
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,320
the Four Seasons hotel conference room for the presser, but it actually set up an event

549
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,720
in front of a small landscaping company called Four Seasons Total Landscaping.

550
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,700
I have no idea what actually happened here, if they intended it to be there or if someone

551
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,840
screwed up, but it was pretty hilarious.

552
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,760
Giuliani gave a rambling nonsense speech right at the moment when the networks called the

553
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
race for Biden.

554
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Ooh.

555
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
It was a total mess.

556
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
Oh, brutal.

557
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,360
At the event, one of Giuliani's guests was an alleged poll watcher named Darryl Brooks,

558
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,800
who turned out to also have been, quote, incarcerated in the 1990s on charges of sexual assault,

559
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,440
lewdness, and endangering the welfare of a minor by exposing himself to two girls ages

560
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
seven and 11.

561
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,160
Ah, it's a false flag Democrat, if I ever heard one.

562
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,320
Well, according to an article in The Cut, quote, Brooks denied the charges and said

563
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,680
his arrest was a police setup.

564
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
Oh.

565
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
So-

566
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
There we go.

567
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
Claims of false flag-

568
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
So it's a double false flag.

569
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
Perhaps.

570
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,640
That's what led into becoming the false flag.

571
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
That's what happened.

572
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
I don't know.

573
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Ah, must be.

574
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,920
Anyway, because this guy is somebody who's identifiable, it makes things a little bit

575
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,320
more confusing for the claims that were being made at this press conference.

576
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,560
Apparently, it was being alleged that Brooks was a poll watcher in Philadelphia and not

577
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,080
being allowed in to check the rolls and everything.

578
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,160
But he lives in New Jersey, and it's not like he's a low profile New Jersey resident.

579
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,800
An article in Politico quoted Reed Giscoria, the mayor of Trenton, New Jersey, as describing

580
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,280
Brooks as, quote, New Jersey's perennial candidate, because Brooks had run from many different

581
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,520
offices in New Jersey, including the Senate and House.

582
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
Wow.

583
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,160
The state of Pennsylvania requires poll watchers to be registered voters in the counties they

584
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,360
wish to poll watch, so he couldn't have actually been in a position to actually make the claims

585
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,440
that he was making.

586
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
Right, right, right, right.

587
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,640
This whole thing was a disaster for Giuliani, from the strange location to the almost comically

588
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,440
bad timing to the poll watcher alleged who he had as a witness who couldn't possibly

589
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,720
be a poll watcher but is actually a convicted child abuser.

590
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,000
If anything, I would expect Alex to want less coverage of this.

591
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,160
Everything is bad.

592
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,480
Every element of that press conference was bad.

593
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:21,960
Yeah, I mean, but that's a perfect example of how we are held hostage by their unreality.

594
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,440
That should be a criminal offense.

595
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,640
All the stuff that happened at that presser, I know they're not illegal, but if you do

596
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,360
that, you should be like, you can't be near other people.

597
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
Tiny bullhorns.

598
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,440
You're going to get someone hurt.

599
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,520
We need crews of people with tiny bullhorns on the ready.

600
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,460
That's what Arkham Asylum is for.

601
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:48,880
People who accidentally scheduled press conferences in front of the Four Seasons fucking...

602
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,880
Flamescaping.

603
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,040
Yeah, exactly.

604
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,400
That's Arkham.

605
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,720
It's not a crime.

606
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,160
It's something that people need to be kept there.

607
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,160
Imagine.

608
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
You got the Joker.

609
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
You got Killer Croc.

610
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,560
You got Rudy Giuliani.

611
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
Why are you here?

612
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,400
I set up a weird press conference.

613
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,000
They would all be like, yeah, no, you're the only one we're not letting escape.

614
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,400
You're too gone for us.

615
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,600
Whenever the Riddler comes and lets everyone out, he leaves Rudy.

616
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

617
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,680
At least we get the place we're going to heist right, okay?

618
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,280
Batman doesn't beat us there because we got to the wrong place, okay?

619
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,400
They're like, oh, no, no, no, Rudy, you got to stay here to give a message to the Bat

620
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
for us.

621
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Give a press conference.

622
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Outside of Arkham Asylum.

623
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Yeah.

624
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Yeah.

625
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Ugh.

626
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
God.

627
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
What an asshole.

628
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Yep.

629
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Jesus.

630
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,920
So Alex gets to talking about the China.

631
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:50,160
He has this interesting idea that isn't based in really anything, but I got really lost

632
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,720
in thought after listening to this clip because I think it's really a really good example

633
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,760
of why it's really frustrating to take things that Alex says at all seriously.

634
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,680
So instead of making China a capitalist country at the end of World War II, criminal elements

635
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,480
of the Rockefeller Combine, Dave Rockefeller wrote a book about this and wrote two articles

636
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,420
in the New York Times, and I always go back to this because this is key, this is the real

637
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,000
world, and sent George Herbert Walker Bush in there with James Baker and the rest of

638
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,240
them to make a deal with the communist Chinese after they'd spent 25 years enslaving and

639
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,740
killing 80 million other people and getting them to behave and after they'd follow every

640
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,040
directive of one child policies and horrible things that the Rockefellers told them to

641
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
do.

642
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,900
They said, yeah, kill about 80 million of your people and one child policy and we'll

643
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:46,040
make you the global superpower of economics, but you're not allowed to have a big military.

644
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,720
But of course, wink, wink, they're globalists.

645
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,240
They were building a big military the whole time.

646
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,400
That's why you saw the pivot under Obama was because China wasn't following its agreement

647
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,000
to not be expansionist.

648
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,320
They were given all the rare earth minerals and all the economic power and they were allowed

649
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,040
to economically expand, but America would economically close, but then would have military

650
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
dominance still.

651
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,200
That's how you divide power.

652
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,840
That's the rollerball allegory.

653
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
That's really how globalism works.

654
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,280
The original movie with James con 1972 or whatever it is is dead on.

655
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Yeah, of course.

656
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:22,280
It's always, it's always a fucking movie and that's why like it's so frustrating to listen

657
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,280
to him.

658
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,020
Like it starts with, you know, that clip there, it starts with him saying something really

659
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,280
absurd like that a decision was made by people like the Rockefellers to have China not be

660
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,120
capitalist at the end of world war II and that kind of thing gets me kind of interested.

661
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,440
Well, at least it would have earlier on doing this show.

662
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

663
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,320
You know, that's, that's a laughable and nonsensical claim.

664
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,160
You know that even without doing any research, like what does it even mean?

665
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,160
Yeah, yeah.

666
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,560
I would ask Alex to explain what mechanisms were used by the Rockefellers to keep China

667
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,480
from being a capitalist country.

668
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,620
If I were to do this because of doing this show, I know that Alex would just point to

669
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,440
John Birch society talking points about how the U S didn't do enough to help Shanghai

670
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,240
Shek in the Chinese civil war, which is the claim that's then exaggerated into the Rockefellers

671
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,400
installed Mao.

672
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Sure.

673
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,160
Still, I like this absurd claim.

674
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,840
It's stupid, but probably sounds smart to his audience and I can kind of appreciate

675
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
that.

676
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,880
That's kind of the kind of the sort of thing that I dig my, uh, my, my teeth into.

677
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,960
Sure, sure, sure.

678
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,520
He claims that David Rockefeller wrote a book and two articles in the times about this whole

679
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,520
China stuff.

680
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,600
And that's just not true.

681
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,840
The op-eds Rockefeller wrote don't look great with the hindsight of history on our side,

682
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,260
but they're nothing like Alex is claiming them to be.

683
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,080
He also wrote a book called memoirs, which is an autobiography, but if that admission

684
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,740
is in there, it'd be really simple for Alex to produce it, which weirdly he never does.

685
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,600
Then everything falls apart with the rambling about the imaginary deal where China gets

686
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,440
to have the economy and U S gets to have the military, which incidentally is something

687
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,540
similar to like, uh, something Alex might be cribbing from a piece of dystopian sci-fi

688
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,120
from the time when he was a child.

689
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,120
Yep.

690
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Seems to be a pattern.

691
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Yeah.

692
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
It does seem like that is often the case.

693
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
Yeah.

694
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
The original movie roller.

695
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,440
What's your favorite X file, Dan?

696
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
Logan.

697
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,440
Yep.

698
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,640
The original movie roller ball was based on a short story called roller ball murder by

699
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,360
William Neil Harrison published in Esquire in September, 1973.

700
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,520
It's a little bit different than what the movie ended up being.

701
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,280
Uh, as it's far more a statement about the rising brutality and public's taste in entertainment.

702
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,300
There are also similarities to the movie version though.

703
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:24,640
Like it's a kind of clunky and not, not super great short story itself.

704
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:31,380
There's a lot of mention of various women's shapeliness, but I mean, James con was great

705
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,380
in the movie.

706
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,380
Sure.

707
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,380
Yeah.

708
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,380
I read it.

709
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,920
I read something that James Cod was talking about.

710
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,360
Like, uh, he's like, man, love doing those roller ball scenes, but then I had to go at

711
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
act.

712
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
All right.

713
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,760
Ah, that was about as a process for thief too.

714
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,800
I think loved those roller ball scenes.

715
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,980
In the short story.

716
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,980
It's not so much like different countries do different things.

717
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,040
It's that within the United States, different corporations run six different concerns of

718
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,640
life, energy, transport, food, housing, services, and luxury.

719
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,640
Each is a super powerful corporation and the main character, Jonathan E plays for the roller

720
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,040
ball team run by energy company based in Houston.

721
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,180
The actual story is about a guy who's the best roller ball player in the world, struggling

722
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,880
with his sense of self, finding himself unsatisfied while living a life filled with money, power,

723
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,360
sex, and celebrity.

724
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,160
The brutality of the sport has been increasing with new rules being added to satisfy the

725
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
public's lust for violence.

726
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,240
Gradually things get more violent with rules added to penalize players who aren't trying

727
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,560
hard enough by having their helmets confiscated.

728
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,920
This all culminates in the all-star game at the end of the season, where there's a new

729
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,700
rule that's added where there's no time limit for the game, essentially making a gladiatorial

730
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,920
contest where pretty much everyone is guaranteed to die.

731
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,820
Jonathan wants something more out of his life, but he doesn't know what, but as the all-star

732
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:54,800
game gets closer, his only request is that he'd be able to see his estranged wife again.

733
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,680
She comes to him and they fuck for a few days and then they remember their shared love that

734
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,680
they had.

735
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,680
Jonathan had convinced himself that in the past she'd been taken from him by the evil

736
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,360
corporation, but he realizes that wasn't the case.

737
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,200
Quote, it would be nice, I think, once to imagine that she was taken away from me by

738
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,280
some malevolent force in this awful age, but I know the truth of that.

739
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,520
She went away simply because I wasn't enough back then, because those were the days when

740
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,080
I yearned—before I yearned for anything, when I was beginning to live to play the game.

741
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,120
But no matter.

742
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,140
For a few days she sits on my bed and I touch her skin like a blind man.

743
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,840
It's implied that they both realize they can't go back to their younger lives even if there

744
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,520
is love between them, and Jonathan knows that he has to play the all-star game even if it

745
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
means almost certain death.

746
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,120
The story concludes, quote, before the game begins I stand with my team as a corporation

747
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,560
him plays.

748
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:51,740
I'm brute speed today, I tell myself, trying to rev myself up, yet a dream in my thoughts

749
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,840
I'm a bit unconvinced.

750
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,640
A chorus of voices joins the band now as the music swells.

751
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,920
The game, the game, all glory to it, the music rings, and I can feel my lips move with the

752
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,760
words singing.

753
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,360
William Harrison fleshed out the story into a screenplay that no longer really resembles

754
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,600
the point of this original work, there's some parts of it that are still carried over, and

755
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,740
it actually directly contradicts it at certain points.

756
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,400
The director of the movie has explained why they made the movie, telling the Guardian,

757
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,200
quote, I thought that violence for the entertainment of the masses was an obscene idea.

758
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,800
This is what I saw coming, and that's why I made the film.

759
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,840
The original and the movie are both commentaries on the idea of brutality as entertainment,

760
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,140
but in order to make the movie out of a ten page story, they needed to add a whole plot

761
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,920
about the corporations fearing that Jonathan was becoming too much of an individual in

762
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,920
the corporate world built on conformity.

763
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,600
Sure, Logan's run just came out recently.

764
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,320
The game and the people's reaction to it, as well as the violence depicted in the movie

765
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,320
itself and the people's reaction to that, were the point of the movie rollerball.

766
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,660
If it has any artistic merit, it's that attempt for a statement.

767
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:02,900
The dystopian sci-fi future backdrop, they're absolutely unnotable, and they only really

768
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,360
exist as a way of justifying why the game exists.

769
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,660
Yeah, yeah.

770
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,880
Alex doesn't know how to wrestle with or analyze works of art.

771
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,480
He refuses to understand subtext or deeper meaning, so it honestly makes perfect sense

772
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,680
that he'd think that all this dystopian fiction from his youth is secretly about the communist

773
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,320
conspiracy that no one will admit is right in front of their face.

774
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,720
Here's an example.

775
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,600
There is a phenomenon you could point to, which is that a lot of movies, particularly

776
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,000
dystopian action movies, seem to exist in a world ruled by rigid authoritarians who

777
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,280
have molded society into a state of uniformity.

778
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,720
You could point this out and provide a number of examples, and that's fair.

779
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,780
Alex might see this phenomenon and argue that this is because the globalists are using predictive

780
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,760
programming to tell the world about what they're going to do to them.

781
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,740
There's a cosmic contract law clause that states that these evildoers can't carry out

782
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,480
their evil deeds unless we all consent to them, so they put this stuff in movies to

783
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
get us to accept it.

784
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,800
That is the theory for why there's such a consistent feature like this in this genre.

785
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,920
I would argue that it's because the setting of a rigid, uniform world is one where it's

786
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,160
incredibly easy to differentiate a hero character from the rest of the world.

787
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,520
Even an anti-hero or a flawed person can easily be cheered for when they're the only person

788
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,960
who has any modicum of individuality in a sea full of facelessness.

789
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,280
Putting your character and their story into that setting is kind of a genre-based shortcut

790
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,440
for plots where the tension is about individualism versus conformity.

791
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,400
Engaging with text and art with even just a baseline of critical ability allows you

792
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,720
to see authorial intent and understand the more complicated things that are being said

793
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,440
by artistic works, and it brings a richness to your life.

794
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,320
It's a critically important exercise now more than ever, and honestly, it's one of the

795
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,680
things that I find most fascinating about Alex.

796
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,920
I do believe that most of the stuff he says is embellishment or lies or things he doesn't

797
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,360
actually believe or kind of believes, that his inability to grasp the point of literature

798
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,280
in movies is something so consistent in his career that I find it difficult to accept

799
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,000
that it's not a genuine feature of his brain.

800
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,280
So yeah, it's annoying to do this show because I end up thinking about Rollerball.

801
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah, that'll happen.

802
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,560
And thinking about like, huh, there was an attempted statement that they were making

803
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:22,280
there and the corporations and shit in the movie and all that is really just to make

804
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,480
it so you're watching this movie and you're like, oh yeah, that's why that exists.

805
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,880
That's why that brutal game exists that would never exist in our world.

806
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,520
The commentary is about people's taste for sport and entertainment becoming more and

807
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,920
more violent and the logical extension of that is a game where everyone's killing each

808
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
other.

809
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:49,120
Everyone's like, ah, that itself could not exist in our reality.

810
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,520
So the commentary couldn't be made by plugging it into the present day because there'd be

811
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,280
too many things like, hey, why isn't everyone getting sued for this?

812
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,920
This would never fly.

813
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:04,000
So you plug it into this dystopian authoritarian world in the future and then you're like,

814
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
oh yeah, that makes sense.

815
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,280
And it makes it so much easier to cheer on your hero, Jonathan M. Even if he's not a

816
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
great person.

817
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,720
I wonder what it would have been like if Alex, instead of being into hard sci-fi and watching

818
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,480
Rollerball at that age, he would instead watch like, they shoot horses, don't they?

819
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,560
Watching everybody in that fucking exploitative, destructive dance contest, realizing that

820
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,840
the real dystopia is where we live now.

821
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,360
I just, I, I, I just, I don't know.

822
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,400
I do wish that he was better at reading.

823
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,560
Yeah, that would be nice.

824
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,160
I wish a lot of people were better.

825
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,240
I wish almost everyone was better at reading.

826
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,360
It's a, it's a difficult skill.

827
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,560
It is, it seems like it should be easy considering we talk to each other, but then you think

828
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,040
about it and you realize most people don't even talk to each other, honestly.

829
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,600
It's really hard to understand what people are saying because their brains don't speak

830
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,200
the words that their brains think.

831
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Yeah.

832
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
It's very strange.

833
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
One of the more interesting things that...

834
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,200
I feel like an alien right now.

835
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,040
These human beings, they act so strange.

836
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
So weird.

837
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,040
Yeah.

838
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,840
One of the more interesting things I found while I was looking at, I was reading about

839
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:19,320
Rollerball was that the writer, William Harrison, he was like, I want more violence in this

840
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
movie.

841
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
Of course.

842
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,560
He was like, he wants the movie to be super violent.

843
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,880
He wants to make the point that the violence is supposed to be repulsive.

844
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,360
So brutal that when you watch it, you go, no.

845
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,800
You're disgusted by it.

846
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,040
And then when people watched Rollerball, they were like, man, Rollerball is cool.

847
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Yeah.

848
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,640
And then the director of it was talking about how like most of the, most of the European

849
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:47,360
audiences that we've talked to understand that it's supposed to be that this is disgusting.

850
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,400
And most American audiences are like, we should start a Rollerball league.

851
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,580
Frankly, what's CTE?

852
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,720
What's the difference between CTE and Rollerball?

853
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,320
We might as well get Rollerball while we're at it.

854
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Anyways, Vince McMahon, get the XFL the fuck out of here.

855
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,840
Get the RFL right in here, man.

856
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,880
That's what I'm talking about.

857
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:14,780
So anyway, that sort of off sidetrack about the Rollerball off to the way, we get more

858
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,640
complaints about China.

859
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,480
That we live under this and it's all been one-sided.

860
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,760
It's not about Kumbaya and one world living together and all this great stuff.

861
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,360
Communist China was allowed to buy up our debt, buy up Hollywood, buy up our whole infrastructure.

862
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,800
So I've been thinking about this for a while, and I think that this is one of the newer

863
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,800
formulations of like the Jews run all the banks, you know, that kind of bigoted conspiracy

864
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,880
theory.

865
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,240
I think that the Chinese own all our debt is a sort of a new one of those.

866
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,200
It's one that a lot of people, if they don't do any research, kind of passively accept

867
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,720
because it sounds like something they've heard someone say before.

868
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,720
Sure, sure, sure.

869
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,400
And it's like, oh yeah, why wouldn't they?

870
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,320
They bought up all our debt is such an intimidating thing where you're like, why would you buy

871
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,320
debt?

872
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,320
I'll believe you.

873
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,320
Yeah.

874
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,320
But it's just complete bullshit.

875
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:06,040
According to Market Watch, the US government itself owns 27% of the US debt, with US investors

876
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,880
owning a further 32.5%.

877
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,960
The Federal Reserve owns 11.2%, which is just a slightly more complicated form of the government

878
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
owning it.

879
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,320
So all that added up is 70.9% of the US national debt that's owned essentially by US interests.

880
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,320
Sure.

881
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,440
Compared to that, the amount owned by China is not that much.

882
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,340
As of 2018, they held about 5.6% of our national debt in the form of like treasury bonds.

883
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,840
But Japan also had 4.9%.

884
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,560
And I don't hear Alex yelling about the dreaded Japanese threat.

885
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,840
Oh, well, they make our Sony stuff.

886
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,160
These countries have bought these bonds because generally speaking, they're considered good

887
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,800
investments, since most world currency is tied to the dollar.

888
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,240
Also in 2020, Japan overtook China as the largest foreign investor in our debt.

889
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,240
So the dynamic that Alex is describing is even more wrong.

890
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,580
Ah, but what you're getting wrong there is China owns 99% of Japan's debt.

891
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,720
So they secretly own all of the other 4.4%.

892
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,720
Yeah.

893
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Yeah.

894
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,400
So people, they want to spread this fear, and what it's based on is the idea that China

895
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,400
owns our debt.

896
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,760
And what they can do is they can call in that debt, like you repay your debt whenever they

897
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
want.

898
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,280
Like a landlord who's giving you a slide.

899
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Exactly.

900
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,840
And this is just another anti-communist conspiracy talking point that's based on more or less

901
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
nothing.

902
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,560
Alex wants to create that image because it means that China rules us.

903
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,160
They can say the word and destroy our economy at any second.

904
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:37,220
They don't own enough of our debt to really matter that much in that term, and also investing

905
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,560
in our debt doesn't work like that.

906
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,800
Our national debt is a super complicated thing, and it isn't the same as your personal debt

907
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,640
that you might have if you're like laid on a gas bill.

908
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,640
There are too many real world factors to make it sensible to discuss as like a one factor

909
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,380
thing, like bigger number debt equals worse, or whatever.

910
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,680
But that's basically what Alex is doing, and then adding on a layer of conspiracy China-baiting

911
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,960
for fun.

912
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,680
China didn't buy up all our debt, they don't own Hollywood, and they didn't buy all our

913
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,680
infrastructure.

914
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,680
Yeah.

915
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,960
These are all just talking points Alex repeats over and over again until his audience accepts

916
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,840
them as being fact, when it's all just kind of warmed over birch or nonsense.

917
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:21,440
Yeah, it's very interesting to me that like one of the ways that the conservative propagandists

918
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,080
get normal people to believe they're bullshit is because they try and make it that micro

919
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,640
level of like, you have debt.

920
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,920
If someone calls in that debt, that'll fuck up your day.

921
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,400
The same thing is true for the United States, but what they don't realize is that when you

922
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,480
get to the United States, money's imaginary.

923
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,420
If they called in our debt, what happens?

924
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:46,240
We print more, and then inflation goes up, and their money's worth less.

925
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,720
You know, like it's stupid.

926
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:54,720
There is a serious incentive for them not to do this based on their own economy.

927
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,160
Yeah, it's all imaginary.

928
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,640
You can print more money, and that's fine.

929
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,240
You're just, inflation goes up, and all other kinds of bullshit happens.

930
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,480
There's a hundred different after effects of that that, you know, there's, yeah.

931
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
It's all magic.

932
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,480
It's all magic.

933
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,240
But even that being understood, what Alex is saying is just dumb.

934
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
Totally.

935
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,120
But it sounds compelling in the same way that, you know.

936
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,760
You have debt, and if somebody calls it in, it'll fuck your day up.

937
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,960
It's very simple to like get across.

938
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,920
So I want to ask you a question here, Jordan.

939
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,080
I think that you've done, you know, we've been at this for a while.

940
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,680
You understand Alex pretty well.

941
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,440
In this next clip, Alex discusses what his greatest sadness is.

942
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,520
Do you think that you could guess what his greatest sadness is?

943
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:45,800
The just unending swath of dead dogs in his wake.

944
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,480
I would assume that that guilt would weigh heavily upon him.

945
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,440
I don't know if he feels that bad about it.

946
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,440
Just an astonishing number.

947
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,160
Most of the time when he talks about it, it seems like those dogs had it coming.

948
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,160
It's almost wistful, yeah.

949
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,160
According to him.

950
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
Yeah.

951
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,160
No, you're incorrect.

952
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,160
OK.

953
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,880
Here's my greatest sadness.

954
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,440
The average person that's a leftist buys into the system, they go and they get one degree

955
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,440
and they can't get a job.

956
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,440
They get two degrees.

957
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
They can't get a job.

958
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,440
They get three degrees.

959
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
They can't get a job.

960
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,040
Or they get some little government or bureaucracy job and they tell them, once we overthrow

961
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,120
America and create a socialist utopia, you're all going to be in charge and have mansions.

962
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:25,760
And they believe this.

963
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,840
They're never going to be brought into the power structure.

964
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,760
They're absolute jokes and they're vicious and they're hateful.

965
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:41,440
So Alex's greatest sadness is over-educated liberals and leftists who can't find jobs.

966
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,440
Yeah.

967
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:48,320
So the socialist utopia is a capitalist utopia where we switch who lives in mansions.

968
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,760
Is that what he thinks is going on?

969
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,760
Yeah, probably.

970
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,880
He would assume so, right?

971
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,720
He doesn't understand socialism at all.

972
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,960
In this next clip, Alex has recognized that there are, you know, some people showing up,

973
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,440
maybe it's state capitals and being like, false flaggers.

974
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,440
Yeah.

975
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,400
No, I mean, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're the real deal.

976
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,400
Patriots.

977
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,800
Oh, I wouldn't admit that right now.

978
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
They're good Patriots.

979
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,680
Just going down there to say, Hey, what's going on?

980
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,360
I wouldn't admit that preemptively votes, you know, and stuff.

981
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
Sure.

982
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,360
And because of this, there's also a lot of people who are showing up at the white house

983
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:29,400
and Alex thinks that, you know, there's a few people now, but soon there'll be millions.

984
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:36,160
It's so obvious by the weekend, they'll announce by the winter, they're going to pick a Saturday.

985
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,500
So people aren't at work.

986
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:43,260
And so they can all use social media to say, let's put a million people around the white

987
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,260
house.

988
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,260
It won't be a million today.

989
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:51,840
It'll be a hundred thousand today today.

990
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,440
Won't be a million today, it'll be a hundred thousand.

991
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,720
But by the time Trump isn't leaving in a week or two, there'll be a million, 2 million,

992
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,440
and they will tear those barricades up and storm the white house.

993
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,440
That's been the plan.

994
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,100
The Democrats said that's their plan and Hey, the globalists have never gotten in trouble

995
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,240
for anything they've done.

996
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,920
So why wouldn't they do that?

997
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,440
Because they're never held accountable.

998
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,120
I mean, if Trump like directly is like, I don't respect the results of an election,

999
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,320
you know, and it's like, I'm not leaving.

1000
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,840
I wouldn't be surprised if tons of people show up.

1001
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,840
I don't know.

1002
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,100
I don't know how to quantify numbers, but I w I mean, a million people showing up outside

1003
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,560
the white house doesn't seem impossible to me.

1004
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:41,040
I think that's a pretty, you know, that, that might happen if a leader refuses to step down.

1005
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,040
I could see it.

1006
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,000
At a certain point, I think we can, we could go real high.

1007
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,360
We could go real high then.

1008
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,360
Not good.

1009
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,360
Not good.

1010
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,360
Definitely not good.

1011
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:57,980
There were tense standoffs outside the white house a couple months ago over the George

1012
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,920
Floyd protests and what have you.

1013
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:07,320
I don't, I don't know if people would storm the white house, but people would be shaking

1014
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,320
fences.

1015
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,880
You think we're going to get a moat around the white house soon?

1016
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,880
I don't know.

1017
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,880
You want to go with a moat?

1018
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,000
I don't, I don't know.

1019
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I don't know.

1020
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I don't know.

1021
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
You don't know.

1022
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,800
I think, I think a moat's coming and I think it's, I'm fine with that.

1023
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,800
Let them have the house.

1024
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,720
Let them have the house.

1025
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,120
Let them live there.

1026
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,120
Lock them in there.

1027
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,120
Give them a moat.

1028
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,120
Put alligators on there.

1029
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,560
I was just thinking about if they do a moat, I have the solution.

1030
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,560
Tons of jello.

1031
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,760
A bunch of jello powder in there.

1032
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,760
Oh man.

1033
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,760
Make a jello moat.

1034
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,760
That's true.

1035
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,760
That is true.

1036
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,480
The moat system may be outdated in terms of defensive effectiveness.

1037
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,960
Yeah, back in medieval times, they didn't have jello.

1038
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,720
You didn't have jello.

1039
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:56,260
So anyway, there's a situation here where Alex is, I just really can't stand this waffly

1040
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,560
back and forth nonsense of the fucking devil's coming.

1041
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,560
Oh, hey, let's learn lessons for next time.

1042
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,560
Hey, come on.

1043
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:08,000
Or this, apparently, you know, hey, maybe, maybe, maybe everything will be all right.

1044
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,240
I'm going to air some clips and then I'm gonna get refocused and come back, go through the

1045
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,520
election fraud, go through other key points of who's behind the machines, how there is

1046
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:21,540
a very narrow way out of this.

1047
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,500
A very narrow way out of this.

1048
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:29,260
And then I'm going to explain that there is another path.

1049
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:34,960
And that path actually is more destructive and very horrible, but will actually hasten

1050
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,120
the destruction of the global order and the destruction of the new world order.

1051
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,560
And they have stepped into it.

1052
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,160
Now, I have no desire to go down this path, but I will go down it if they take us there.

1053
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,440
And don't worry, you're going to go down that path, too, because there's no getting out

1054
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,700
of this now.

1055
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,880
Everyone is going to see world government manifest, you're going to see everything I've

1056
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,400
told you come true, everything, everything.

1057
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,520
So that's violence.

1058
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,880
That's street violence.

1059
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,400
That's murder of your neighbors and war and stuff.

1060
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,840
That's the other path.

1061
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,020
But there's a narrow path, which is Trump seizing power, basically.

1062
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:15,760
You can kind of get the sense that, like, okay, now the conversation has become, Trump

1063
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:23,540
has got to become king or else, like, we're all fucking shooting.

1064
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:27,280
And that's not encouraging, I would say.

1065
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,800
For sort of a baseline, so you're like, yeah, this is just where we're at, I don't know

1066
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,800
if I enjoyed that.

1067
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:40,920
No, I mean, right now I enjoyed the election results coming in and Biden winning outright.

1068
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,280
That's good stuff.

1069
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:49,740
But the amount of overconfidence and gloating that's going on before Trump has entirely

1070
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,560
left the White House is a little nerve wracking for me.

1071
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:58,240
I don't like it when people who I've seen gloat before and have all of our lives destroyed

1072
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,160
because of it gloat again.

1073
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,160
I don't like it.

1074
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,560
I don't like seeing it.

1075
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:09,120
Yeah, and I think because it's kind of untested territory, we really don't know how much of

1076
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:14,040
the stuff that goes on between an election and an inauguration is norms.

1077
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1078
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,400
It's going to, we're going to turn out to find, it's going to be a lot, it's going to

1079
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,400
be a lot of norms.

1080
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,400
It very well may be.

1081
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,780
It's going to be a lot of norms that are no longer on the, on Cheers.

1082
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:30,840
So in this next clip, Alex has very few friends left in the media, or I mean, not friends,

1083
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,760
just people who even just doesn't hate now.

1084
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1085
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,320
One of them, Lou Dobbs.

1086
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,320
Sure.

1087
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,320
He likes Lou Dobbs.

1088
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,320
All right.

1089
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,920
First I want to play a very important clip.

1090
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,240
Sidney Powell with Lou Dobbs discusses hammer and scope card.

1091
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,240
And this is very, very important.

1092
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,240
It's a good place to start.

1093
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,240
So we're going to play this clip and we'll be right back.

1094
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,720
So the long and short of this is that there's a conspiracy going around that there's a super

1095
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,520
secret overpowered computer called hammer that can run a program called scorecard, which

1096
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,900
was used to manipulate and change the results of this election.

1097
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,160
This desperate and absurd conspiracy is being sold by people like guests on Steve Bannon's

1098
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,920
show, Mike Flynn's attorney, Sidney Powell, and Lou Dobbs.

1099
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,280
These are high profile people in right-wing spheres.

1100
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,520
This just isn't like some fringe, completely online nonsense.

1101
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,600
So I was wondering, where did this come from?

1102
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,400
Luckily, I did not have to look too far.

1103
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,840
Will Sommer over at the Daily Beast had already put together a great piece about how all the

1104
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,920
claims about this supercomputer and the program come from a single source.

1105
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,620
It's someone who I have a special bond with.

1106
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,600
This all comes from Dennis Montgomery.

1107
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,600
God damn it.

1108
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,600
Yup.

1109
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,080
God fucking damn it.

1110
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,080
I was amazed.

1111
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:43,240
How has Dennis Montgomery found a way to claw back into reality?

1112
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,480
I was amazed to see his name come up again.

1113
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,480
Motherfucker.

1114
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,240
It would take far too long to get into this right now, but back in March 2017, on the

1115
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,880
25th episode of our podcast, we dedicated two and a half hours to Dennis Montgomery

1116
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,340
and his various frauds.

1117
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,520
So if anyone's interested in why you don't need to take anything that traces back to

1118
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,760
him seriously, go ahead and check that episode out.

1119
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,760
My god.

1120
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,840
Also, Will's article on it is a really good breakdown too.

1121
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,840
I believe it.

1122
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,840
This is how these dicks work.

1123
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,820
Supposedly respectable outlets on the right are so desperate for a big overarching explanation

1124
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:16,380
for how they were screwed in the election that they're willing to amplify and give credibility

1125
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:21,240
to claims being made by a career con man whose lawyer is Larry fucking Clayman.

1126
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,480
You can't do it.

1127
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:29,360
How is it that even in this world, people don't just like, Oh, it's Larry Clayman.

1128
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,360
Get the fuck out of here.

1129
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,800
Like Larry Clayman, Larry Clayman's coming for you eventually.

1130
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,960
Like it doesn't matter what if you're on the hard right.

1131
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,960
It doesn't matter.

1132
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,520
Sooner or later, Larry Clayman, Larry Clayman is going to sue you.

1133
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,520
Hey, sued Alex.

1134
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,520
He sued everyone.

1135
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,520
Roger Stone.

1136
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
Don't listen to him now.

1137
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,960
No, you don't even need to worry about the lawsuits.

1138
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,040
Just look at him and look at the things he's done.

1139
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,640
Look at the, the, the, the track record and be like, yeah, pass.

1140
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,640
Yeah.

1141
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,640
Yeah.

1142
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,640
Yeah.

1143
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,640
Don't care.

1144
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,120
You could have the biggest scoop in the world and I'm going to take the hit if you're right

1145
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,120
this time.

1146
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,120
Totally.

1147
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,560
I'm going to just bite the bullet and say, I don't trust anything you say.

1148
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,400
And if that bites me in the ass, I still did the right thing.

1149
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,780
The idea that you might like see a James O'Keefe video pop up and just be like, well, maybe

1150
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,080
he got it right this time.

1151
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,680
No, no, no.

1152
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,680
That's bad.

1153
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,680
That's bad thinking.

1154
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,680
Yep.

1155
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,200
So this next clip, Alex, like I said, he's, he's, he's kind of interested in these ideas

1156
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:29,280
about millions of people showing up at the white house, but also he doesn't like that

1157
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,080
the media is downplaying the number of people that are coming to Owen Schroyer's rally in

1158
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,080
Austin.

1159
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:40,960
He's very preoccupied and spends a lot of time talking about crowd sizes in Austin.

1160
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,080
Oh, and get out of studio for a while.

1161
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:47,720
Notice that there are thousands of people at rallies at all 50 capitals around the United

1162
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,720
States.

1163
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,720
I was down there just a few hours ago at the Texas Capitol DPS estimated there were about

1164
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,080
2000 people.

1165
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:05,520
Thousands more are showing up right in front of the South side of the Texas Capitol.

1166
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,600
And again, I sent some photos to you guys.

1167
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,800
It's actually on Savannah Hernandez's Twitter from a building above that actually shows

1168
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,800
the big giant crowd.

1169
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:23,560
I'll just pull it up on my phone, but the local news you will notice is not showing

1170
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:35,860
it because the local news does not want you to know what is unfolding and what is happening.

1171
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,640
And that's, that's how they operate.

1172
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,640
Yeah.

1173
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,640
In fact, let's not even show it.

1174
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,200
I want to show the above shots because I don't want to just look at my big fat ugly head

1175
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,680
up there and, you know, talk about how there's thousands of people.

1176
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,680
I'm going to, I want to show the overhead shot.

1177
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,680
I'm gonna go to rebroadcast.

1178
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,680
I'll find it.

1179
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,680
It's not the crew.

1180
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,680
I just have to have this.

1181
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,680
I just have to have it.

1182
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,680
Or I can't do the show.

1183
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,680
Okay.

1184
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:02,320
And then I'm going to read to you the breakdown from the president, a new statement that has

1185
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,880
come out and then I'm going to go through everything else that is here.

1186
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:14,840
But right now let's go ahead and play Ali Alexander at the Capitol.

1187
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:19,120
And then I want to show the project Veritas.

1188
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,120
There it is.

1189
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,120
Look at that.

1190
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,120
And I'm not throwing a fit.

1191
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,200
I just want people to see that I need you to see this picture.

1192
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,200
Oh my God.

1193
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,200
Yeah.

1194
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,200
I don't know.

1195
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,200
I don't know.

1196
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,200
I'm not throwing a fit.

1197
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,200
Yeah.

1198
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,200
I'm not throwing a fit.

1199
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,200
He doesn't actually go to rebroadcast though.

1200
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,820
I mean, whoever he is, whatever intern he's hired was able to pull that up before the

1201
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,820
pot bubbled over.

1202
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,160
Before it got too bad.

1203
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,160
Yeah.

1204
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,160
All right.

1205
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,100
But he does spend a lot more time than this even on just like the crowd size pictures

1206
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:49,280
and it's like, boy, this is exactly the same as after the 2016 election.

1207
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,280
Sure is.

1208
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:55,600
This is just like a sort of fun house mirror version of, oh, we did the election.

1209
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,800
We talked about fraud.

1210
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,580
We talked about complaining about different claims about crowd sizes.

1211
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,120
It's just that this guy lost this time.

1212
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,640
It's almost exactly the same.

1213
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,640
Yep.

1214
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,720
Just beat for beat, just with a different angle.

1215
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,920
I just, I just can't believe that they're going to accept this.

1216
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:18,520
Like it's not going to, every other year during an election season, Alex is going to scream

1217
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,600
about how it's the devil.

1218
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,720
And then every other year he's going to be like, well, I know we lost, but we got a path

1219
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,420
through this and it's never going to stop.

1220
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:32,220
They will always be convinced that it's the devil and they will always be convinced that

1221
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,480
it's fine that the devil won this time.

1222
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,240
Well, if it's so inferior.

1223
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,240
Yeah.

1224
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:41,520
If things can keep going, it does seem like that would be just how things will go.

1225
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,840
That's just how it operates.

1226
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,840
Yeah.

1227
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,800
And then just come up with fun, interesting stuff to say about whatever headlines he didn't

1228
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,280
read the articles of and keep going.

1229
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:54,600
How disappointing would, how disappointed do you think God is that they're like, we

1230
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,280
only fight against the devil in an election year.

1231
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,440
Come on, man.

1232
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,840
And we fight against the devil's assistant during the midterms.

1233
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1234
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,840
The devil takes the midterms off.

1235
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,640
You got to delegate responsibility sooner or later.

1236
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,880
Otherwise you burn yourself out.

1237
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,300
And if you're the devil, you're at high risk of burning.

1238
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:22,680
So Alex is preoccupied with these crowd pictures and I could not find myself giving a shit.

1239
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:28,560
And I ended up turning off this episode, this Saturday episode, because it was so boring.

1240
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:34,920
It is so much just like over and over again, rambling, repetitious, the election was stolen,

1241
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,120
but it also was really uninspired.

1242
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:42,120
Like here's a little clip that just sort of sums up kind of how I feel it went.

1243
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:47,760
They just stole this bigger than Dallas right out in the open.

1244
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,080
You know, you think about stealing something.

1245
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:53,020
You're kind of like a cat burglar going in to get the jewels.

1246
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:58,320
There was no cat burglar in going on here, ladies and gentlemen.

1247
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,440
This was done out in the open.

1248
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,800
There's a feeling of resignation almost to the fact that like, ah, they stole it.

1249
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,800
We've proven it.

1250
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,880
What are you going to do?

1251
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,280
And I don't understand that.

1252
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,600
No, no, no.

1253
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:16,760
I mean, I understand it if you don't actually believe any of it, then it makes perfect sense.

1254
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,780
I understand that, but that's a weird space to perform in.

1255
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:26,620
Especially if you've made your last entire year and a half, a referendum on whether or

1256
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:31,560
not the tree of Liberty does need to be watered with the blood of tyrants from time to time.

1257
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,420
And apparently, I guess not this year.

1258
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,640
It's been abundantly clear what his position on that is.

1259
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,120
You would think that you don't go back from that.

1260
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,120
Yeah.

1261
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:45,800
So we have this situation where we're, you know, in this period after the election where

1262
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:50,980
it's the 79 days of hell and Biden is the president elect and Alex, you know, Trump

1263
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:56,560
hasn't conceded and Alex doesn't know what he's, you know, I, I find it to be like one

1264
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:01,720
of the most important points for us to be like really tracking what are the moves, what

1265
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,300
are the things he does.

1266
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:07,500
And I found this Saturday to be just almost unlistenable.

1267
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,920
It's just banging the gong over and over again.

1268
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,920
Election was stolen.

1269
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,920
Treading water.

1270
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,040
But yeah, but treading water, boring.

1271
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,040
Yeah.

1272
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,040
Yeah.

1273
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,040
Yeah.

1274
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:22,300
Um, and so I needed to jump into Sunday and like get a sense of something and I really

1275
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:25,920
feel like Alex didn't do it for me at the beginning of the show.

1276
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,720
I can tell you as bad as it is, we're going to come through this stronger on the other

1277
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,480
side no matter what happens to Trump.

1278
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,480
We're not.

1279
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,800
The devil is killing us all.

1280
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,840
I'd wish that we could bypass what's coming.

1281
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,940
I wish we could have gone around this, which you could have had an easy landing and kept

1282
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:46,400
Trump and there's still 20% chance of doing that.

1283
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,200
There's about a hundred percent chance of doing that if Trump takes dramatic action.

1284
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:55,680
So there's a 20% chance of him winning, I guess, I guess the election and then a hundred

1285
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,400
percent chance of everything going cool if Trump sees his power, right?

1286
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,680
That would be a hundred percent chance.

1287
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,680
I don't know.

1288
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,040
2020, I'd give it a 50 50 shot.

1289
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,320
Well, no, no, no.

1290
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:12,040
Cause with the hundred percent chances of Alex getting what he wants and he was still

1291
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:15,840
wouldn't, but he would get the, what he wants in the form of Trump staying in power and

1292
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:22,000
Trump, not Biden, not being in office where Trump to unilaterally declare himself a dictator.

1293
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
That'd be great.

1294
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Yeah.

1295
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,200
I'd be stoked about that.

1296
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:29,200
So there's only 79 more days of hell.

1297
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,440
So when I do these shows, it requires a lot of thinking, a lot of preparation, a lot of,

1298
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,280
you know, sitting around and thinking like, what is he trying to say here?

1299
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,240
You know, there's a lot of that.

1300
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:43,720
And so I'm accustomed to stretches of, of intense mental exertion.

1301
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,720
Sure.

1302
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,720
Alex, he is too.

1303
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:53,840
I brainstormed so hard this morning from about 6 AM to about 12 noon when I got to the office

1304
00:57:53,840 --> 00:58:02,880
that I got completely exhausted about an hour and a half ago and had to go take a nap.

1305
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,880
Okay.

1306
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,880
All right.

1307
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,880
Thinking is hard.

1308
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,880
That's fair.

1309
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,880
I love shit.

1310
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,200
I told everybody to kill everybody, but now I think that's a bad idea.

1311
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,960
So what's my next move?

1312
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,360
Power nap, power nap, seize power nap.

1313
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,360
All right.

1314
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,360
I know what to talk about today.

1315
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,960
You know, I think this is a new thread that I hope will go on throughout the podcast as

1316
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:29,760
Alex reverting to dream space for his, to find the answers.

1317
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:35,200
Alex becoming sort of like the shaman of the right wing extremist world.

1318
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,880
He's going to hire a Daniel who's going to interpret his dreams for him and then we've

1319
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,880
got this all covered.

1320
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,880
That's Rob Dew.

1321
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,880
That's why he's still around.

1322
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,880
That's Rob Dew.

1323
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,880
Yeah, absolutely.

1324
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,480
Owen's not going to do shit, but yeah.

1325
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:51,520
So Alex gives a little, tells a little story about his family's breakfast time this morning

1326
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,880
that I found kind of disturbing.

1327
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,880
All right.

1328
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,760
Well, this morning I talked to my oldest daughter and my wife at breakfast while my three year

1329
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,880
old daughter played in toy cars and blocks on the floor and I prepared them both for

1330
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,880
what was happening.

1331
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:09,960
And both my wife and my oldest daughter finished my sentences before I could even complete

1332
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,720
them and they looked at me and they said, we know you're right.

1333
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,720
We're ready and we understand.

1334
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:20,160
And it was a very good feeling, a feeling of strength because they weren't repeating

1335
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,200
things that have been drilled into their head.

1336
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,580
I'd never really put these things on them, but they'd been listening and they'd been

1337
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:26,580
checking the truth.

1338
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:31,760
My oldest daughter, Charlotte looked to me and she said, dad, you're almost always right.

1339
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,200
A little tear came out her eye.

1340
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:39,160
And that was meant so much to me when I gave him this speech at the breakfast table at

1341
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:43,400
8 AM this morning and I laid out the future.

1342
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,200
I told him we tried to stop what was coming.

1343
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,600
I told him what was coming next and they understood.

1344
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:53,640
You just imagine like sitting around with like some granola, Alex stands up and he's

1345
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,640
like, at this breakfast I must tell you the future.

1346
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,960
This is a dinner conversation for sure.

1347
00:59:58,960 --> 00:59:59,960
Totally.

1348
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,120
This is a family meeting.

1349
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,680
These kids are too young for coffee.

1350
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:06,520
You can't handle Alex Jones predicting the future without a little caffeine in you.

1351
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,520
Right?

1352
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,520
Yeah.

1353
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,520
That's not fair.

1354
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,520
You can let him get through the morning.

1355
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,560
I'm not going to deal with the apocalypse in the morning.

1356
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,680
Absolutely not.

1357
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:18,000
I don't know why, but that mental image to me is like in the real world, disturbing.

1358
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Oh, terrifying.

1359
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
In a movie, hilarious.

1360
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
It's so funny.

1361
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
So funny.

1362
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Man.

1363
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,400
And the worst part is, here's the worst part for me.

1364
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:31,160
The kids don't know something that's fundamentally true that would change everything about their

1365
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,240
outlook on life.

1366
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,640
Their dad is Alex Jones?

1367
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,360
No, they're going to be fine.

1368
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,360
They're going to continue to be rich.

1369
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,560
They're going to continue to be taken care of.

1370
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:44,720
They're going to continue doing everything with no changes at all.

1371
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,720
Well.

1372
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,720
None.

1373
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:47,720
Yeah.

1374
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,520
I mean, I guess I would say they're going to be fine in many material ways.

1375
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,520
Well.

1376
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,520
They're not going to be fine emotionally.

1377
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,520
Without your dad.

1378
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1379
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,520
No, no, no.

1380
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,520
That's what I'm saying.

1381
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,520
That's what I'm saying.

1382
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,520
Yeah.

1383
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:03,680
If he just sat him down and been like, listen, I am always lying.

1384
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,120
We're going to be fine.

1385
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,120
Don't worry.

1386
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,120
Why are you crying?

1387
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,120
There's no need to cry.

1388
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,120
We're rich as shit.

1389
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,120
We don't actually care.

1390
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,960
The tear in her eye and saying you're almost always right doesn't sound like something

1391
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,080
that someone else says.

1392
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,080
That sounds like Alex writing dialogue for imaginary characters.

1393
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,480
It does seem like that.

1394
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:26,040
Anyway, I would be more upset with him telling this story about preparing his children and

1395
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:32,600
his wife for the coming tribulation or whatever the fuck if he didn't have really good reason

1396
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:38,120
to suspect that there is corruption in the election.

1397
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:42,640
And one of the pieces of evidence he brings to the table is, uh, I mean, fuck, I'm, I'm

1398
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,640
convinced.

1399
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:50,480
You know, Google has a big article that's up on info wars.com, Google analytics.

1400
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,860
And they had a record search in the days before the election and the days after the election

1401
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:59,680
that no one ever searches.

1402
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:05,000
What is the penalty was one of the searches and what is the consequences and what is the

1403
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,440
prison time and what is the jail time?

1404
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,740
These are searches no one's ever done that they ever, but now it was by the thousands

1405
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:25,080
per state in Pennsylvania, in Georgia, in Minnesota, in Wisconsin, in Michigan.

1406
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,520
The search was for what is the consequences?

1407
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,620
What is the penalty?

1408
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,560
What is the prison time for election fraud?

1409
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,560
Wow.

1410
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:39,320
Cause that's election officials in fraud, not voter fraud.

1411
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,720
Who do you think might be searching?

1412
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,720
There it is.

1413
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,720
Scroll up.

1414
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,640
Google trends, searches for election fraud, punishment surge in the key battleground states.

1415
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:50,400
It's not just those mores come out.

1416
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,640
That is people checking to see what's going to happen to them.

1417
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,860
What a conclusion he's jumped to.

1418
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,720
That is a big jump.

1419
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:03,680
So you're saying that people are Googling the crime they're about to commit or have

1420
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,680
committed.

1421
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,480
What kind of trouble am I in?

1422
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,480
What?

1423
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:08,480
Why?

1424
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,480
Oh my God.

1425
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,480
Yeah.

1426
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,800
You don't think it might have something to do with maybe right wing people constantly

1427
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:19,040
hoping retribution will come to their enemies and wishing that there's some sort of punishment

1428
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,760
that they can discover that will be worse than death?

1429
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,760
Silly friend.

1430
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,360
This is a forensic fingerprint that proves that election officials are trying to figure

1431
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,760
out what they got to look forward to because they committed election fraud.

1432
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,760
Wow.

1433
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:31,760
Wow.

1434
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:32,760
What a good thinker.

1435
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:33,760
That is really good thinking.

1436
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,760
Yeah.

1437
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,760
I'm impressed by him constantly.

1438
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,960
If that's the result of his brainstorming, he does not need to work for six hours.

1439
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:39,960
You should take a nap though.

1440
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,320
You should take a longer nap.

1441
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,320
Yeah.

1442
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:46,680
Because you'd probably have the exact same analytical abilities.

1443
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,680
Pretty better.

1444
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:51,840
So Alex says something in this next clip that I found really interesting and it's a good

1445
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:59,800
example of like how there's sort of a dark mirror version of real world things that are

1446
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,200
oftentimes behind his rhetoric.

1447
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,280
When I come back from break, I'm going to explain what they're saying to the president

1448
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:10,120
inside the white house right now and how they're trying to get him to concede.

1449
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:14,840
But let me just say this right now.

1450
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:21,960
If Trump concedes, they're going to blame him for the COVID-19 deaths.

1451
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,920
They're going to set up a truth and reconciliation commission and demonize all of his supporters

1452
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,880
and they're going to make the lockdown and the shutdown of our economy 10 times worse.

1453
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,640
And now Biden's announced that.

1454
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,000
So I find this kind of interesting.

1455
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,280
I don't know if I disagree too much with Alex's assessment of things that could happen if

1456
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,640
Trump concedes and Biden becomes president.

1457
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:46,400
I just think that he's portraying these things in an intentionally false light.

1458
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,120
First he says that they'll blame Trump for the COVID-19 deaths.

1459
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,880
And to the extent that anyone should be blamed, it probably should be the executive officer

1460
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:57,280
of the country who was in a position to make decisions that he failed to make.

1461
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:01,720
Obviously no one would say that it's all Trump's fault, but the conversation about policy failures

1462
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:06,040
and new information about what was known when and what was ignored would almost certainly

1463
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,320
paint Trump in a terrible light.

1464
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:14,240
Especially if he's staked his entire reputation on being a perfect chief executive officer.

1465
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:18,880
Yeah, you could easily see someone like Alex experiencing a harsh, sober look at Trump's

1466
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,640
virus response as the globalists blaming him for all the deaths.

1467
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,280
So that might actually be a fair assessment just through a twisted mirror.

1468
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:32,320
I mean, you don't get to take credit for the things that the, and then not take blame for

1469
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,320
things.

1470
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,320
Well, apparently you do.

1471
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,320
Oh, okay.

1472
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,320
Nevermind.

1473
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,320
I forgot about that.

1474
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:41,720
And there will be truth and reconciliation committees to demonize Trump supporters.

1475
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:46,040
This is obviously Alex's way of spinning the inevitable necessity of trying to bring humans

1476
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:49,900
in this country back to a place where we can even communicate with each other.

1477
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:53,640
The fracturing of a shared reality is something that needs to be addressed, and any attempt

1478
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:58,260
to do that is a threat to someone like Alex whose entire business relies on the perpetuation

1479
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,560
of that false reality.

1480
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:04,500
Attempts by people who aren't in his fantasy world to humbly reach out and reintegrate

1481
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:09,000
people who got sucked into the Trump cult or Q-shit is obviously going to be painted

1482
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,520
as communist indoctrination by Alex and truth and reconciliation committees.

1483
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:20,960
His business cannot afford for him to present it any other way, but the attempts at reaching

1484
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:28,120
out and having like, okay, look, that shit was really bad, but we need to figure out

1485
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,520
a way to move forward.

1486
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,780
That will be what this is if Trump concedes.

1487
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,280
The third thing he says is that there will be even harsher lockdowns.

1488
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:40,160
Now I'm not sure if that's actually the case or how Alex would define any of those terms,

1489
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:44,420
but I do think that if Biden were to get into office, a more adult, reasonable approach

1490
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:46,480
to a public health crisis would be enacted.

1491
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,980
It would be easy for Alex to paint that as this harsh crackdown.

1492
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:56,020
All of the things that he's describing, if Trump concedes, are things that are based

1493
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:59,320
on kernels of things that could be real.

1494
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:07,080
It's just preemptively painting them as these evil nefarious plans that the globalists have.

1495
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:11,680
That's how he gives himself the credibility of having like all these good predictions

1496
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,240
of the hell that will come upon us.

1497
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:19,440
Sure, but it's not that hard in this case because we already have been told ad nauseum

1498
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:25,520
what a reasonable response would be and we've already not seen it, so then taking a reasonable

1499
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:30,480
response is already baked into their propaganda.

1500
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,400
The fact that we didn't take a reasonable response makes us super smart for killing

1501
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,280
200,000 people, and if they do take a reasonable response, then it's because they're trying

1502
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,880
to hurt our economy.

1503
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:46,180
It's just, yeah, they've already won that messaging.

1504
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:53,360
On this Sunday, I felt a little bit still untethered, like there wasn't much going on.

1505
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,800
He's just kind of saying the election was stolen.

1506
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,800
Sure.

1507
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,800
Hooray.

1508
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,800
Sure.

1509
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:05,040
But then we heard this clip, and man, Owen Schroyer, he had Steve Pacanich on and they

1510
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,320
sort of dropped the ball.

1511
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,980
He's about to make up for it in a big way.

1512
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:14,220
Let's go ahead and lay it out right now.

1513
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:20,800
Owen Schroyer started tomorrow, he's going to launch a caravan that's going to leave

1514
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:24,960
at 5 p.m. from a location we're going to announce, and it's going to drive you to Houston and

1515
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:32,480
then along the Gulf of Mexico border through Louisiana, Mississippi, into Florida, where

1516
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:39,040
it will turn north into Georgia, and we'll go up through the Carolinas into Virginia,

1517
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,760
where I will meet it in DC on Friday.

1518
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:43,760
I want to make a bet on this.

1519
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,760
And we're going to call for others to launch caravans around the nation.

1520
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,960
I want to bet on this.

1521
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,460
I would like to bet on this a million dollars.

1522
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:53,680
In the Midwest, in the South, and in the East Coast, to DC, truckers are already announcing

1523
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:58,000
big strikes they're going to have, take over to DC this next weekend.

1524
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,720
So don't worry, President Trump, the cavalry's coming.

1525
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,360
Now I'm fucking excited.

1526
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,360
Wow.

1527
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,360
Yes.

1528
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,360
Wow.

1529
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,360
Now we are in business.

1530
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,360
Countdown to quit.

1531
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:12,680
The new segment on Knowledge Fight, countdown to the caravan quitting.

1532
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:16,400
Well, I mean, caravan is also an unfortunate term for them to use because the right wing

1533
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,680
was all obsessed with the caravans coming from south of the border.

1534
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:20,680
Sure, sure, sure.

1535
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,680
Those are bad caravans.

1536
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,680
Seems like a weird term.

1537
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,240
They should have chosen a different word.

1538
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,240
Yeah.

1539
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,240
But-

1540
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,240
Convoy is right there.

1541
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,240
You guys are southern dum-dums?

1542
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,240
C.W.

1543
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,240
McCall would let you use the song.

1544
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,520
Convoy is right there.

1545
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,520
Yeah.

1546
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,520
Hey there, rubber duck.

1547
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,520
We got Owen Troyer.

1548
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:35,520
What are we doing?

1549
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,520
We got Owen Troyer with some Smokies on his tail.

1550
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,520
Caravan.

1551
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,520
Get the fuck out of here.

1552
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,840
Turn it into a convoy.

1553
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,840
Have a little excitement.

1554
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,720
We're the epic convoy coming up top Trump.

1555
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,520
And caravans are just plodding along from destination to destination.

1556
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,520
Convoys?

1557
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,520
They're escaping some shit.

1558
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,520
Or they're running moonshine.

1559
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,520
Or they're running.

1560
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1561
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,520
You're right.

1562
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,520
It should be-

1563
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,520
It should be a convoy.

1564
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,520
Yeah.

1565
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,520
Yeah.

1566
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,520
And they could-

1567
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,520
This is why the hard right sucks at everything.

1568
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,520
They couldn't even get convoy right.

1569
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,520
It starts with the same letter.

1570
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:06,760
And if Alex really wanted to put some money into this, he could hire Kellyanne Conway

1571
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,280
to run the Kellyanne Conway convoy.

1572
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,480
Kellyanne Conway, yeah.

1573
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,480
It could work.

1574
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,800
I like it.

1575
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,320
Alliteration should guide all choices.

1576
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,320
Yes.

1577
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,240
So I got very, very, very, very, very, very excited about this.

1578
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,240
Yes, I am very excited.

1579
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,520
I am so pumped to see-

1580
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,520
What a great punishment for Owen, too.

1581
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,520
Wow.

1582
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,080
What a brilliant way to punish Owen.

1583
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,400
Well, actually, I think it's two-pronged.

1584
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,880
I don't know if it's necessarily a punishment, but it's like no one else could probably do

1585
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,880
this.

1586
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:37,880
True.

1587
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:41,520
And Owen really came into Infowars by yelling at people on the street.

1588
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,520
True.

1589
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:47,440
And the only real value to the organization isn't as somebody who can tell whether Steve's

1590
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,560
full of shit or not.

1591
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,560
Not good.

1592
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:50,560
He can't conduct interviews-

1593
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:51,560
Nope.

1594
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,560
Credulously at all.

1595
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,560
Really bad at it.

1596
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:57,640
So why not just send him on a fucking tour convoy and have people yell at him-

1597
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:58,640
That's what I'm saying.

1598
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,640
And yell at other people.

1599
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,800
It's play people to their strengths.

1600
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:02,800
Exactly.

1601
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,160
You did the pajonic shit.

1602
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,160
You fucked up.

1603
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,160
Totally.

1604
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,160
Now we're going to get back to basics.

1605
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,160
Yeah.

1606
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,240
We're going to focus on what you do well, and then maybe you'll get your shot again.

1607
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,240
Yeah.

1608
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,240
He got knocked down a peg.

1609
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,240
Yeah.

1610
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,240
Yeah.

1611
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,240
You wanted to play out of position.

1612
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,240
Yep.

1613
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,240
You blew it.

1614
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,240
You blew it.

1615
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,240
Now get back.

1616
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,240
Apprentice, go back to where you began.

1617
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,240
Exactly.

1618
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,240
Absolutely.

1619
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,240
So I'm excited.

1620
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,240
I'm so excited for that.

1621
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:30,000
The potential for hilarity is so high for this.

1622
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Is this documented?

1623
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,440
Somebody has to have a camera crew there, right?

1624
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,440
No, no, no.

1625
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,440
Of course.

1626
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,440
Of course.

1627
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:37,440
Owen Schroyer has his own show.

1628
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,440
The One Room.

1629
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:39,440
I want the raw footage of this road trip.

1630
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,360
There's a channel on band.video right now for the caravan.

1631
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,360
Is it live streaming?

1632
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,360
No, no.

1633
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,360
Oh, shit.

1634
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,360
God damn it.

1635
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,360
I want the raw on this.

1636
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,760
We can edit something beautiful.

1637
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:58,440
I can't tell you, I've not been this excited for some dumb idea because he can't stop this.

1638
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,960
It's something that's supposed to happen over the course of this week.

1639
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:06,480
Owen Schroyer is already somewhere, undisclosed location at this point.

1640
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,480
This is happening.

1641
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,720
I want to bet money on whether or not this makes it all...

1642
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,320
I will bet you money right now.

1643
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,920
Alex does not make it to DC.

1644
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,920
I'll take that bet.

1645
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:16,920
You'll take that bet?

1646
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:17,920
Alex is flying.

1647
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,920
He's already bought the tickets?

1648
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,920
I'm sure.

1649
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:21,920
I think he's going to cancel it.

1650
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:22,920
I don't think he's going to make it.

1651
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:23,920
What do you want to bet?

1652
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:24,920
Let's bet 50 bucks.

1653
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:25,920
Okay.

1654
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,920
Charity.

1655
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:27,920
Let's bet 10 bucks.

1656
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:28,920
50 bucks to a charity.

1657
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:29,920
50 bucks to charity.

1658
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:30,920
Yeah, yeah.

1659
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:31,920
I'll take that bet.

1660
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,920
Sounds good.

1661
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:33,920
I'm going to win this bet.

1662
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:34,920
Alex is going to DC.

1663
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:35,920
Okay.

1664
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,920
All right.

1665
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:39,520
I'm going to go dumb.

1666
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:44,400
I feel like the better bet is whether or not Owen makes it.

1667
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,600
Ooh, that's a good question.

1668
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,880
Because he's actually got a challenge in front of him of stopping at all of these cities.

1669
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:50,880
That's true.

1670
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,880
Alex is just going to fly.

1671
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,880
That's what I'm saying.

1672
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:57,000
See, but what I'm saying is if Owen doesn't make it, there's no way Alex can save face

1673
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,680
on that, right?

1674
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,040
It would be tough, but it would also be...

1675
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:03,440
It's debatable whether or not the presentation would be better if Owen doesn't make it.

1676
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,440
That's true.

1677
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,440
That is true.

1678
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,440
I know.

1679
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,440
I know.

1680
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,440
Oh, man.

1681
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,440
They have to make up some story about him being stopped?

1682
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,440
Oh, that's what I want.

1683
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,440
That's what I want.

1684
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,440
You listen to me good and you listen to me well.

1685
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,440
Yeah.

1686
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,440
Okay.

1687
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,440
All right.

1688
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:18,440
Now.

1689
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,440
Okay.

1690
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,800
If there were any way for this to have been possible, I would almost do anything to be

1691
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,620
on that bus.

1692
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,480
Like to be a Hunter S. Thompson type.

1693
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:28,480
Totally.

1694
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,640
Like, hey, look, I don't like you guys, but I want to do some Gonzo journalism where I

1695
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,200
come on this bus with Owen.

1696
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,520
I'll stay out of your way.

1697
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,200
I'm not going to fuck with anything.

1698
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,320
Just to be able to record this for history.

1699
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,640
No, that's what I'm saying.

1700
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,920
If there's raw footage, this should be filmed all the time.

1701
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:47,400
This should be a road trip documentary and we should have the final cut.

1702
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,480
This should be the new Cannonball Run.

1703
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,480
Totally.

1704
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,480
Holy shit.

1705
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,480
There it is.

1706
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,480
Holy shit.

1707
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:54,480
Writing it down.

1708
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,480
Some...

1709
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:56,480
Now.

1710
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:57,480
Jordan.

1711
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,480
Jordan.

1712
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,480
Jordan.

1713
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,480
Cold open.

1714
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,480
I have to...

1715
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,480
Fade in.

1716
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,480
I have to...

1717
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,480
I have to punch this up.

1718
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,480
Okay.

1719
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:06,480
I have to punch this up in there.

1720
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,480
Alright.

1721
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,480
And he's got to get to DC through all these stops.

1722
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,480
Sure.

1723
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,480
Sure.

1724
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,480
Sure.

1725
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,480
Sure.

1726
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,480
Also, Antifa is there.

1727
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,480
Right.

1728
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,480
And they have to get to DC.

1729
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:16,480
So we're getting to wacky racist territory.

1730
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,480
Yes.

1731
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:18,480
I want John Cleese involved.

1732
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,480
Of course.

1733
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,480
Absolutely.

1734
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,480
Rowan Atkinson can get involved.

1735
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,480
We have rat race going on.

1736
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,480
It's a rat race all over again.

1737
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,480
Yeah.

1738
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,480
Yes.

1739
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,480
We need to have an Antifa news organization.

1740
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,760
And then there's, there's gotta be somebody who's dastardly and a dog that laughs.

1741
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,840
These are the things I know about the wacky races.

1742
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:37,160
And, and one car that's like, they're drunk, but we're not going to show them drinking.

1743
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,160
We're just going to let that go.

1744
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,160
Because they're driving.

1745
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,160
Yeah.

1746
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,160
Yeah.

1747
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,160
Yeah.

1748
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,160
They're characters who are drunks.

1749
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,160
You know what's going on.

1750
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,160
Yeah.

1751
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,160
We're not showing this for legal reasons.

1752
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:47,160
So anyway, you can tell I'm very excited about this.

1753
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,160
I'm stoked about this.

1754
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,160
Yeah.

1755
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,160
This is an exciting new development.

1756
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,160
Yeah.

1757
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:54,080
This is the first time I've been really excited about something Infowars done in a while.

1758
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,080
Yeah.

1759
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:58,840
Although I do think that there is the potential for this to go really bad because I think

1760
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:02,520
a lot of the people who might be drawn to that would be violent type.

1761
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:03,520
Sure.

1762
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,480
And certainly we, I hope that that's not the case and that's not what I'm excited for.

1763
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:11,520
I'm excited for Owen tripping over his own foot all the way up the Eastern seaboard.

1764
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,520
Totally.

1765
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,520
That's what I'm interested in.

1766
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,520
Totally.

1767
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,520
Yeah.

1768
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,920
Imagine if Paul Revere had like a two legged horse.

1769
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,920
That's what we're dealing with here, man.

1770
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:20,920
Yep.

1771
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,480
So Alex gets to talking to Ali Alexander.

1772
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:27,320
He comes on and they're just trying to get Trump not to concede.

1773
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,320
Sure.

1774
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:34,120
And it's so critical Ali to not get the president to concede because the cavalry is coming and

1775
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:38,400
the evidence of fraud is mounting massively Ali Alexander.

1776
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:42,920
We know that the president is watching these broadcasts and so I want to say Mr. President,

1777
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,360
the Calvary is coming.

1778
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:47,640
So you got Calvary and cavalry coming.

1779
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,640
Oh man.

1780
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,640
It's exciting.

1781
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,640
Calvary.

1782
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,360
You're the guys who like the Bible.

1783
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,360
Figure it out.

1784
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,360
Maybe that's the problem though.

1785
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,360
They like it.

1786
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,360
They like it too much.

1787
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,360
Yeah.

1788
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:03,080
So you've seen Ali Alexander really coming into his own as a real like hardline zealot.

1789
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,080
Yeah.

1790
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,720
Real, real religious Christian zealot.

1791
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,920
So maybe he is actually saying Calvary.

1792
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,920
That could be.

1793
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:10,920
That could be.

1794
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,240
The Calvary is coming for you.

1795
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:13,680
We're going to put you up there.

1796
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:19,960
So if the election is to be believed by the, you know, all the sources that are reality,

1797
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:20,960
right.

1798
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:21,960
Then Biden won.

1799
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:22,960
Yes.

1800
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:23,960
And even if that's the case, Trump should still be president.

1801
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:24,960
I think that's great.

1802
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,760
Even if he'd won the election in which he hasn't, we have a right to not let him beat

1803
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:32,120
the president because they claimed Trump was this Russian agent with no proof.

1804
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:37,260
With Joe Biden, my God, Ali Alexander, we've got incredible evidence.

1805
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,840
We've got damning evidence.

1806
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,840
We've got him dead to rights.

1807
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:44,640
So I mean like why even do the election then based on what you're saying?

1808
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,640
Pretty much.

1809
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,640
Yeah.

1810
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,160
You're, you're saying that the person is disqualified.

1811
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:53,820
So like why wasn't your argument, I mean, why, why wasn't there like a position of fuck

1812
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:56,520
this election, we shouldn't even do it.

1813
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,520
Sure.

1814
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,760
Instead of let's do the election, the Democrats are going to try and steal it and Trump will

1815
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,040
win by a landslide.

1816
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,040
Yeah.

1817
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,040
I don't understand.

1818
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:07,640
I mean, they tried to sell that with the only way that it's a fair election is if Trump

1819
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,640
wins.

1820
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,640
So why do the election?

1821
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,080
Because if he doesn't win, it's an unfair election.

1822
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,800
But at the same time, the argument with that wasn't let's just not do the election.

1823
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:15,800
Yeah.

1824
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,400
Now, now it's like we shouldn't have done the election.

1825
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,400
We shouldn't even have done it.

1826
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,400
It doesn't matter if Biden wins.

1827
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,400
It turns out we could lose.

1828
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,040
I didn't expect that.

1829
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,040
Yeah.

1830
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:27,480
I think that's another thing that they're, they're not able to comprehend how stupid

1831
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:28,480
it makes them look.

1832
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,480
Right.

1833
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:30,480
Okay.

1834
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,240
So you're saying that Trump had no, like it's all fake evidence and none of it's real.

1835
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,960
They had no evidence for the Russia thing.

1836
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:36,960
Right.

1837
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,400
But we saw a lot of it.

1838
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,400
Yeah.

1839
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,480
And from varied sources all over the place.

1840
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,480
Yeah.

1841
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,480
Right.

1842
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,880
So if that's manufactured, that's well manufactured.

1843
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:46,880
Quite.

1844
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:51,240
Currently Trump is proving that Biden stole the election.

1845
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,040
We have very little evidence.

1846
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:57,040
Well, we have Rudy Giuliani at a landscaping place.

1847
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,040
Right.

1848
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:02,400
See, so they're even admitting that they're bad, they're worse at faking evidence than

1849
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,400
the, than...

1850
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,400
Shut the fuck up.

1851
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,400
Dennis Montgomery.

1852
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,400
All right.

1853
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,400
And hold your horses.

1854
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,400
I'm sorry.

1855
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,400
Hold your horses.

1856
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,400
Google, Google data.

1857
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,400
Alex showed the Google data.

1858
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,400
That's true.

1859
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,400
That's true.

1860
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,400
Come on.

1861
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,400
That's true.

1862
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,400
Get it together.

1863
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,640
I would, I would think that they could at least get one person like a, like a Michael

1864
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,120
Flynn or a Michael Cohen to like flip for him just for a little...

1865
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:27,880
Michael Flynn's lawyers pumping out the Dennis Montgomery stuff.

1866
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:28,880
Yeah.

1867
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,560
But from the other side, you know, they gotta get a, they gotta entrap someone and have

1868
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,680
them like turn rogue or whatever.

1869
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:41,120
So I think what they really want though, and I think that's something that we've been kind

1870
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,120
of aware of.

1871
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,120
Sure.

1872
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,160
Is for Trump to seize power and is to be a Christian theocracy.

1873
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,160
Yes.

1874
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:48,840
And Ali is a little bit too open about that.

1875
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:53,400
They're perverts and they're seeking to, you and I have talked about this, invert, invert

1876
01:18:53,400 --> 01:19:00,120
all of these holy orders that we have, that Christianity stabilized this, this feral version

1877
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:06,560
of, of what Rome had, you know, after it burned and all this, Christianity injected into Western

1878
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,480
civilization, a stabilizing formula.

1879
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:12,560
And then Western civilization didn't work until we had it.

1880
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,560
Exactly.

1881
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:18,720
So the basis of what we call Western civilization now is Christianity because prior Western

1882
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,040
civilization didn't work.

1883
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:24,280
Oh, so whenever you talk about like Western civilization being what you're all about,

1884
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:29,600
you're actually just talking about like a, I don't know, a Christian religious state,

1885
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,600
a theocracy.

1886
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,600
Oh, okay.

1887
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,600
Cool.

1888
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:35,040
Just, I'm glad, I'm glad that we can have that in the clear now.

1889
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,720
It is, it is kind of, see, it is kind of obvious now.

1890
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,040
I mean, in the clear again.

1891
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,040
Yeah.

1892
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:44,280
I mean, that's really their only option if they, if they can't even really lie about

1893
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:51,800
the election results, cause nobody's buying it, except for everybody that they like, then

1894
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:56,320
your only option is then just to out and out be like, well, in order to save the Republic,

1895
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,200
we have to become a Christian theocracy.

1896
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,200
Yeah.

1897
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:06,240
I think that that's sort of the, the underlying trend that you see from people like Ali, obviously,

1898
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:11,320
and a little bit on Info Wars, but actually the sense that I got from this Sunday episode

1899
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:17,360
was very much not that interested in the election fraud stuff anymore.

1900
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,440
Like he kind of, it's just like, ah, we proved it.

1901
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:25,440
And he has stuff like this that happened, but his focus seems to be elsewhere.

1902
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:29,680
Here's Biden two months ago saying, we've got the most people ever for election fraud.

1903
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:33,120
And then Pelosi, a week and a half ago saying, I don't care what happens with this thing

1904
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:38,720
coming up, he'll be inaugurated after, and they told us they do it with the ballots and

1905
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:42,600
they did it because if there's one thing criminals do, they love to brag.

1906
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,400
Only time they tell the truth is when they're telling you how they're effing you over here

1907
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,400
it is.

1908
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:53,480
Secondly, we're in a situation where we have put together and you guys did, did it for

1909
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:59,180
our administration, the president Obama's administration before this, we have put together,

1910
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:09,640
I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American

1911
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:10,640
politics.

1912
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:14,240
But we are ready.

1913
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:20,080
I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected president on Tuesday, whatever

1914
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:27,800
the end count is, but on the election that occurs on Tuesday, he will be elected on January

1915
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:28,800
20th.

1916
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:34,000
He will be inaugurated president of the United States.

1917
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,700
She's the one that goes to the salon, that's going bankrupt, doesn't wear a mask.

1918
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:41,280
It's caught not wearing, Oh, but for the TV, she wears it up there on the stage.

1919
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:47,040
I find that that like, uh, uh, sort of that second clip, uh, was useless.

1920
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:51,080
I don't think that that was, I didn't, I didn't hear anything in there that was even like

1921
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,080
suspicious.

1922
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:59,720
No, I think, I think he's just trying to pass off just confidence as my knowledge for knowledge.

1923
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:04,100
But I think that perhaps, but I think even he recognized that was so weak that he had

1924
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:08,320
to complain about the salon instead of anything that's in the club that is weak to you.

1925
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,640
Now the one of Biden sounds a little worse.

1926
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:14,280
And if you think that he was just speaking and then accidentally said that they put together

1927
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:18,600
a voter fraud organization, then you might reach the conclusion that Alex is presenting.

1928
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,400
However, that's not Biden misspeaking.

1929
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:25,440
It's a clip taken from an interview on pod save America from back in October.

1930
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:29,280
In reality, if the person who found that clip had allowed it to play in full, it would be

1931
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:33,440
painfully obvious that Biden was talking about organizing to stop and avoid instances of

1932
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,600
voter fraud.

1933
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,560
But honestly, that's not the best word that he could have used.

1934
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:41,800
What he was referring to is more of the broad spectrum of voter disenfranchisement.

1935
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:45,580
Immediately after the clip stops, Biden goes on to discuss the call-in line that had been

1936
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:49,000
set up to connect people with lawyers who can help if they have trouble voting or face

1937
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,120
intimidation at the polls.

1938
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:55,720
These are the sorts of specifics Alex has because it's about appearances, not reality.

1939
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:59,340
That clip sounds really bad, like Biden was accidentally admitting to setting up a voter

1940
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:03,680
fraud organization, but it only does if you only listen to that little snippet.

1941
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:07,240
So you know, you're creating this facade, this veneer, like, oh, we proved it.

1942
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:12,200
He admitted it in public, but he's doing that to sort of not talk about it that much.

1943
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,520
Because I don't think he wants to talk about it that much.

1944
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:18,120
He wants to talk about this goddamn caravan, because that's exciting.

1945
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:21,520
And then he also has an emergency message.

1946
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:30,840
All right, I'm going to issue an emergency message to President Trump coming up at the

1947
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:31,840
bottom of the hour.

1948
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,760
So we've got that message coming up, and I think that that's really where he wants this,

1949
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:37,920
he wants to put his focus.

1950
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:38,920
Sure, sure, sure.

1951
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:44,120
And we'll get to that in a minute, because his focus is never far from one person.

1952
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:48,480
One person in this world haunts Alex like a- Keith Olbermann?

1953
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:49,480
Like a weatch.

1954
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,480
Bill Maher.

1955
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:54,800
He's an indeed disgusting pus bucket that they're preparing to remove, and then Kamala

1956
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,960
Harris will probably bring Hillary Clinton in.

1957
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,240
What a time to be alive.

1958
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,160
Indeed, what a time to be alive.

1959
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:04,840
Still trying to fantasy book Hillary into this election.

1960
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:10,680
I just don't, I mean, if you want millions of people outside the White House, try and

1961
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:14,200
trick everyone into getting Hillary Clinton to become president now.

1962
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:17,800
Wouldn't you just be vice president then, and then Kamala Harris would then have to

1963
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:18,800
step down too?

1964
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:22,040
No, she would step down, they would trade jobs, you know, constitutional stuff.

1965
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,040
Sure.

1966
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,040
Yeah.

1967
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:27,440
So this is where I got, you know, I've already, I think, I think based on our behavior so

1968
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,000
far, you can already tell I'm super excited about this convoy.

1969
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Yeah.

1970
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,280
Now here's where I got real excited.

1971
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:40,600
And then Owen Schroyer is coming in here live, he's live, and he's strong.

1972
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:47,040
And he's preparing to deploy on a four day trip to DC and lead a massive caravan where

1973
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,040
you can join it.

1974
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:52,120
And if you decide to join it, it will send a message to the globalist that they are in

1975
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,120
deep trouble.

1976
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,240
Everybody always wanted to march on DC.

1977
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,240
It's here.

1978
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:00,240
When the chips are down, what are you going to do now?

1979
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,860
Stay with us.

1980
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:07,440
So I felt challenged by that, when the chips are down, what are you going to do?

1981
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,440
Yeah.

1982
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:09,440
And I realized.

1983
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,320
We're going to join that caravan.

1984
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,320
No.

1985
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,640
We have to do an episode on Friday.

1986
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:14,640
Of course we do.

1987
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:19,200
We, this is, if there ever was an emergency episode necessary, we got to follow up on

1988
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,200
the caravan.

1989
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,200
Yeah.

1990
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,200
Yeah.

1991
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,200
The caravan is the only thing I care about now.

1992
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,200
Yes.

1993
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,720
It's the only thing I, because you know what?

1994
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,200
I think that's going to be fun.

1995
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,200
Yeah.

1996
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,200
I think that's going to be fun for us.

1997
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,200
Yeah.

1998
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,720
I even think it's going to be fun for Owen and all the people in the caravan.

1999
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:33,720
You'd forgotten.

2000
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,720
It's going to be a good time.

2001
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:38,160
You'd temporarily forgotten about Assassin's Creed because this caravan is exciting.

2002
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,160
It's great.

2003
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,160
This is a fun thing.

2004
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:41,160
Yeah.

2005
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,680
I want to, now I kind of want to do a caravan.

2006
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:43,680
Yeah.

2007
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:48,040
You almost, like you can just envision in your head like sad moments of Owen with funny

2008
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,040
music behind it.

2009
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,040
Totally.

2010
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,040
Yeah.

2011
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,040
God.

2012
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,040
It's just, it's great.

2013
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,160
So it's not going to be a normal regular thing.

2014
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,160
No.

2015
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,280
But caravan necessitates.

2016
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:58,200
We got to do an episode on Friday about the caravan.

2017
01:25:58,200 --> 01:25:59,200
God damn it.

2018
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,680
We won't know if Alex has shown up in DC by the time that episode comes out.

2019
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:02,680
That's true.

2020
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:08,960
It'll have to be decided on Friday, but there'll be plenty of caravan nonsense to get into.

2021
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:09,960
I can't wait.

2022
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:10,960
I can't wait.

2023
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:11,960
Me too.

2024
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:12,960
God.

2025
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:13,960
It's just going to be a series of banana peels.

2026
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,760
I can't imagine it being anything else.

2027
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:21,440
So Alex teased that he has this emergency message coming up, and here he throws to it.

2028
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,440
Okay.

2029
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,440
The video is at VAN.video.

2030
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,440
It's at Infowars.com.

2031
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:29,720
Alex Jones' emergency message to President Trump, do not concede.

2032
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:33,440
There's over a million people conservatively on our streams, over a million listening on

2033
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:34,440
radio stations.

2034
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:37,920
That's 2 million people conservatively.

2035
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:38,920
I love you.

2036
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:39,920
I appreciate.

2037
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,920
You're amazing.

2038
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:41,920
I appreciate those that brought you here.

2039
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,480
If you decide to spread this video, the president will wake up and say, no, if you don't, we're

2040
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:47,480
doomed.

2041
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:48,480
Here is the report.

2042
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,600
I bet if you spread it, it still isn't going to, nah, it'll be fine.

2043
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:56,600
I don't know if Trump's going to see like, Ooh, a lot of shares on that Infowars video.

2044
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,760
I better wake up, better snap out of it.

2045
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:04,800
Oh man, that Infowars video has almost as many likes as that dumb tweet I just posted

2046
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:05,800
five seconds ago.

2047
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,760
I better change all of my things.

2048
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,640
Yeah, this is where I gotta go.

2049
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:11,640
Yeah.

2050
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:16,700
Now I felt cheated by this because the emergency message that he was teasing, I didn't realize

2051
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:18,660
it was a prerecorded video.

2052
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:21,000
He just did this so he can leave half an hour early.

2053
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,600
He just, oh, that sucks.

2054
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,600
He just leaves.

2055
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,600
That sucks.

2056
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:25,600
He just leaves?

2057
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:30,880
No, but you know, he has an emergency message to Trump, so we better find out what it is.

2058
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,160
Of course.

2059
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:38,000
President Trump, you were about to be approached by Joe Biden and his new COVID-19 commission.

2060
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,600
They're going to tell you that, sir, you're going to be blamed for the hundreds of thousands

2061
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:47,560
of deaths unless you sign onto a new lockdown, contact tracing, and even people being taken

2062
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:50,480
from their homes and forced inoculations.

2063
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:56,040
When you sign onto that, you will be confirming that COVID-19 was your fault and legitimizing

2064
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:00,600
the martial law take down of this country and the complete shutdown of our economy.

2065
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:05,080
This will be the end of the Republic and you, sir, will be known as Benedict Arnold who

2066
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:09,080
allowed it all to happen.

2067
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:12,000
Trump you are going to be approached by Biden's team.

2068
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,080
Trump, they are behind you right now.

2069
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:20,380
Trump, at midnight you will be visited by 13 ghosts.

2070
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:25,600
The fourth will give you an envelope, it has the location.

2071
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,720
Come on, man.

2072
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:27,720
What are we doing?

2073
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:28,720
All right.

2074
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:32,480
So this is kind of what I think Alex wants to turn this into as opposed to worrying too

2075
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:36,280
much about like, ah, voter fraud or whatever, which feels just dead.

2076
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:39,520
It feels deflated even on Alex's show.

2077
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:45,000
What he wants to talk about is during the 79 days of hell, right, Biden and his transition

2078
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:50,240
team are going to have some ideas about better ways to address the COVID-19 situation.

2079
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:57,040
So what the real conspiracy is, is they're going to make like a fucking demand of Trump

2080
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:01,400
that he get on board with their plan, their globalist plan.

2081
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:05,420
And if he doesn't, then they're going to blame the deaths on him.

2082
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:09,000
But if he does, then they're going to blame the damage to the economy that their evil

2083
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
plans do.

2084
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,480
They're going to blame that on Trump.

2085
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:16,800
He has no win situation except to come out and say, go fuck yourselves globalists.

2086
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,200
But then even if they do that, they're going to try and use the 25th amendment to take

2087
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,200
him out of office.

2088
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:22,200
Sure.

2089
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:28,520
It's really much more exciting than Rudy Giuliani's press conference and the very, very boring

2090
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:31,640
voter fraud claims that Dennis Montgomery is peddling.

2091
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:39,540
I just, you'd think that that press conference should take an entire party down.

2092
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,000
That's how sad that was.

2093
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:47,360
I wanted to laugh at it because it's maybe objectively the funniest thing I've ever heard.

2094
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:48,360
Yeah.

2095
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:50,360
And it's confusingly funny.

2096
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,400
Everything about it.

2097
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:57,020
What I thought about it is everybody who is like, oh, comedy is going to be good under

2098
01:29:57,020 --> 01:29:58,680
the Trump administration.

2099
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:04,760
And I'm like, every single thing I've seen of people trying to dunk on this is not as

2100
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:08,720
funny and never will be as it's mere existence.

2101
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:09,840
Like you're never going to win.

2102
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:16,900
There's no point in trying comedy over Rudy Giuliani standing next to a porn shop with

2103
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,720
a fucking pedophile right next to him.

2104
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,780
It just doesn't get better than that.

2105
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:24,520
There's no joke that is better than that.

2106
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:30,000
And it's a landscaping place also called Four Seasons.

2107
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,200
He himself is an implied pedophile after the 15 year old girl thing.

2108
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:38,280
Like this whole thing is off the rails.

2109
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:39,280
What joke do I have?

2110
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,280
None.

2111
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:41,280
None.

2112
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,280
Yeah.

2113
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:47,440
So Alex's message to Trump is largely like, you got to talk more shit, man.

2114
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:53,120
It's so essential for you now to not concede the election, but to come out with your bully

2115
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:59,440
pulpit of the oval office and lay out the Newsweek articles and the new scientist articles

2116
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:05,860
and all the documents that Fauci and Gates under Obama's command before you ever got

2117
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:15,840
into office in 2013, 14 and 15 were running the very exact COVID-19 weaponized virus test.

2118
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,480
Trump, you got to use our talking points.

2119
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:21,880
You've got to get in the oval office and say info wars shit.

2120
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,720
That'll really help me out.

2121
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:27,340
Now what's really funny is if you watch the video of this, while Alex is talking, those

2122
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:31,640
articles flash up on screen and one of them is that article from the scientist.

2123
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:32,640
Oh no.

2124
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:38,440
And right under the headline is an editor's note about how there are conspiracy theories

2125
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:43,800
connecting this article to COVID-19 and the coronavirus and this is all unsubstantiated.

2126
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:48,560
So even as Alex is trying to show this evidence, there's a, this doesn't work.

2127
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:53,000
He's accidentally fact checking himself?

2128
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,180
So they're going to try and remove Trump early is the thing.

2129
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:58,240
That's what this emergency message is all about.

2130
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:03,760
Sir, I want you and your advisors to know what they're planning to do to drive you from

2131
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:11,560
office before January 20th and how they're planning to then blame you for COVID-19 that's

2132
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,880
been their plan all along.

2133
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:19,380
If they're able to trick you, then your legacy and all your supporters will be irrevocably

2134
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:25,280
connected to the COVID-19 deaths and the American people will be persecuted and Americanism

2135
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:30,800
itself will be demonized connected to the Wuhan virus, which is a Chinese communist

2136
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:31,800
bio weapon.

2137
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:32,800
Ooh.

2138
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:39,360
I would say that history is not going to be super kind to Trump's fans period about their

2139
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:44,120
response to probably not going to go well.

2140
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:49,640
I don't think that's dependent on Trump leaving early or staying until January or being tricked

2141
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:52,480
by imaginary globalists.

2142
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:57,840
I think we're just going to look back and be like, huh, it's not weird how poor responding

2143
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:03,080
poorly to a public health crisis seemed to be a policy plank.

2144
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:04,080
Yeah.

2145
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,080
Weird.

2146
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,260
Doesn't seem like a good idea.

2147
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:07,260
That's very strange.

2148
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:09,600
Uh, my new policy is murder.

2149
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,680
It's very weird.

2150
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:11,680
The end.

2151
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:17,140
So anyway, uh, they're going to try and use that 25th amendment to get Trump out.

2152
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:22,480
They will demand that you who is still president elected under the constitution, implement

2153
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:23,880
these plans.

2154
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:29,760
If you do not immediately agree, they're going to say the 260 plus thousand most of the deaths,

2155
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:37,080
as you know, from something else are on your watch and are on your head and that you are

2156
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:42,640
guilty of this under the 25th amendment and are not fit to be the president of the United

2157
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:43,640
States.

2158
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:49,120
I want to further discredit you, not just with this fraudulent election, but to certify

2159
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:54,640
that fraudulent election by having your own cabinet remove you under the 25th amendment

2160
01:33:54,640 --> 01:34:01,040
because you don't follow the recommendations and orders of Joe Biden's new globalist COVID-19

2161
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,040
task force.

2162
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,720
I mean, what's the point?

2163
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:08,000
I don't, I don't understand why.

2164
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:15,920
I think what's funny about this is that he's okay in, in his world, all right, we live

2165
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,880
in a, they, this is what they would do.

2166
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:23,840
So we do it, but they would do what our plans are that we're doing right now.

2167
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:24,840
Right?

2168
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:30,200
So I think Alex is actually saying that one, he knows all of this stuff is true.

2169
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:32,600
This is all Trump's fault.

2170
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:38,720
And that the only way, the best way for us to go about this is to use the 25th amendment

2171
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:42,320
to remove him from office, to do all of this stuff early.

2172
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:48,560
Like he's saying that the best plan is doing all that stuff, exactly.

2173
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:52,240
He's telling us what he would do in our situation, right?

2174
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:55,400
But that's not always still even the best thing to do.

2175
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:59,480
It's not a good plan, but it is funny every time he does this because he's like, here

2176
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:01,400
is what I would do.

2177
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,800
And that's what they're trying to do already.

2178
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:04,800
Yeah.

2179
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:11,320
I hear it more like, yeah, it's going to look real bad if competent leadership comes in

2180
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:13,920
and people are like, oh, this is what we've been missing.

2181
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2182
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:15,920
It's going to look real bad.

2183
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:21,480
It's gonna, it's gonna take a whole lot of the like, oh, the deep state, all these weird,

2184
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:26,200
weird things that have been going on over the past couple of years, these weird excuses

2185
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:29,400
are all just going to look kind of dumb.

2186
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:33,680
And I think Alex recognizes that and, you know, you got to distract people.

2187
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:38,840
The only way to do that is to create something fun in that 79 days of hell.

2188
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:43,960
They're going to try and get rid of Trump before Trump has to leave anyway.

2189
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:49,400
I mean, the thing that scares me is there's only two ways for Trump to go.

2190
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:58,080
And that is to step down early and have Pence write the most broad pardon in the history

2191
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:04,360
of the United States that somehow also supersedes any and all state crimes that Trump has committed.

2192
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:09,960
Or not leave because anything other than those two and he's going to jail.

2193
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:12,600
So I think he knows that.

2194
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:13,600
First of all, innocent.

2195
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:14,600
And he's not going to jail.

2196
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:15,600
Innocent until proven guilty.

2197
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:16,600
Sure.

2198
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:17,600
First of all.

2199
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,600
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

2200
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:22,080
Second, I don't, I don't know.

2201
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:29,400
I don't know if that's the case, but I could easily see some kind of a brokered immunity.

2202
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:30,400
I mean, I don't know.

2203
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,720
There's no, there's just nothing to say.

2204
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:37,240
If he leaves office, he's going to lose all of his money.

2205
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:43,280
Like it's going to be a bloodbath for him personally because he's bad at everything.

2206
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:47,720
And I think what's going to save us is he's too incompetent to do either of the only two

2207
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,240
things that he can do.

2208
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:50,240
Maybe.

2209
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:51,240
I don't know.

2210
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:52,240
That's my suspicion.

2211
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:53,240
I think we'll see.

2212
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,320
I'm not entirely sure.

2213
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:55,320
That's my suspicion.

2214
01:36:55,320 --> 01:37:00,920
But Alex is presenting Trump with this position where like, if you're going to be approached

2215
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:05,800
by a man in a trench coat, then he is going to tell you Biden's secret plan.

2216
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:10,720
And should you say no to this plan, they will blame you for all deaths.

2217
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:14,640
However, if you say yes to it, here is what you got to do.

2218
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:15,640
Or here's what's going to happen.

2219
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:20,320
If you follow the lockdown, they will put your name on the coming depression in the

2220
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:27,360
United States and blame you for all the previous deaths, saying later, you actually admitted

2221
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,400
that you were the one behind it all.

2222
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:30,400
Again.

2223
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,400
You did.

2224
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:32,400
We have tapes.

2225
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:33,400
Don't sign onto it.

2226
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:37,920
You've got to come out and expose Fauci, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, and all of them in Oval

2227
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,160
Office addresses.

2228
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:41,920
And that is the only path to stop them.

2229
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:45,520
So this is the 20% he was talking about earlier, I think.

2230
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:51,840
Is Trump giving Oval Office addresses where he spouts Infowars conspiracies?

2231
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:52,840
Yep.

2232
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:53,840
Alright.

2233
01:37:53,840 --> 01:38:01,520
I guess I think 20% is a embarrassingly high chance to give that of success.

2234
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,520
Sure.

2235
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:06,160
I think as far as Alex goes, this is a great swing.

2236
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:07,480
This is a great swing.

2237
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:08,720
It's as good as he can do.

2238
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:11,120
Because Trump has nothing left to lose.

2239
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,280
And this would be great for Alex's business.

2240
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,320
So why not see if Trump will do some shit for him now?

2241
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:20,800
I think even Alex has to recognize that that's, I think, a fruitless strategy.

2242
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,800
Probably.

2243
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:28,240
But I do think that this is better for Alex than getting too hung up on the election stuff.

2244
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:29,240
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

2245
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:34,160
And also getting too hung up on fucking, like, even addressing Steve's nonsense.

2246
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2247
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:41,080
Like, it's a better game to play that, like, oh, the COVID, it's really about.

2248
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:48,520
Because then that kind of has a stage removed from the, like, strict electoral stuff and

2249
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:49,520
the parties.

2250
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:52,960
You can still, like, claim that there's something outside of politics, that this is about the

2251
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,760
globalist's evil plan.

2252
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:58,160
You know, and I think that that is good for him.

2253
01:38:58,160 --> 01:39:00,600
So I think that that's why he's focusing on this.

2254
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:08,160
And this message to the president, supposedly, is not about fight in Michigan, fight in Pennsylvania.

2255
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:12,480
You know, get there, count the ballots, make sure all of it, you know, like, get Steve

2256
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:13,480
Pachanik on the phone.

2257
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:15,640
He said it's a sting operation or whatever.

2258
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:20,520
You know, like, he's not doing that, because, sure, that should live in the background,

2259
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:21,520
but it's proven already.

2260
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:22,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2261
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:23,520
It's proven already.

2262
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,520
We can move on.

2263
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:25,520
We have to.

2264
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:26,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2265
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:27,520
We have to.

2266
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:28,520
Because there's more pressing information.

2267
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:29,520
Exactly.

2268
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:33,240
And that is that Biden's COVID response team is really a Trojan horse to get Trump out

2269
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:39,320
with the 25th Amendment or, you know, that's that's pretty good on his part in terms of

2270
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:41,680
spin and the way he's playing things.

2271
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:46,640
Let Knight handle Steve Pachanik, get Owen out of the studio for a while.

2272
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:51,680
Let me try and fucking thread whatever needle that I need to, to try and keep us in business

2273
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,000
after next week.

2274
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Yeah.

2275
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,680
And I think that's about as good as you can get.

2276
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:58,880
And it's a better strategy than I would have expected.

2277
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,320
Giant publicity stunt out of this caravan.

2278
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:02,320
Totally.

2279
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,320
Yeah.

2280
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:05,840
No, this is a far better plan than I ever would have expected from them.

2281
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,320
I don't even know if it's a plan.

2282
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:11,760
I wonder if it's just kind of like, all right, what can we do?

2283
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,200
All right.

2284
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,200
This could work.

2285
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:15,200
Yeah.

2286
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:19,160
I don't know if it's some grand machination on their part or anything, but I think it

2287
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:24,520
fulfills a number of the requirements that get around some of the problems they have.

2288
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:30,840
It's still not a good play because it's still like, I mean, what happens when the 25th Amendment

2289
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:32,160
isn't invoked?

2290
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:37,200
What happens when these votes are certified and Biden is?

2291
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:40,560
They do need to have the transition teams take over.

2292
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,560
What happens in January?

2293
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:46,880
These are only little band-aids you can put on this.

2294
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:50,760
There's still a much larger problem that isn't being addressed by it.

2295
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:55,320
But in terms of being like Alex Jones, where you got to keep moving, the shark of lies,

2296
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:57,840
piranha of truth, shark of lies.

2297
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:01,560
In terms of being that guy, it's as good as you can do right now.

2298
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:02,560
And I agree.

2299
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:03,560
Yeah.

2300
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:08,200
I wouldn't be surprised if they half-assed their way into an accidental, competent move.

2301
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:11,280
I don't know if it's, again, I don't know if it's competent.

2302
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:13,480
Competent, we grate on a curve.

2303
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:14,480
That's true.

2304
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:15,480
That's true.

2305
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:16,480
We grate on a curve.

2306
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:17,480
I have to keep reminding myself.

2307
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:21,920
I would have expected him to be eating parts of his desk by now.

2308
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,600
That's the curve I'm dealing with.

2309
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:24,600
Yeah.

2310
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:26,680
I make my desk out of survival foods.

2311
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:27,680
Exactly.

2312
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,680
Why not?

2313
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:29,680
Yeah.

2314
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:32,720
On this desk, it looks like it's made of glass.

2315
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:34,400
It's actually sugar.

2316
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,720
You need calories.

2317
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:40,640
On my last episode, I fall into the desk from 20 feet above.

2318
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,320
Giving Owen an elbow drop.

2319
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,320
Yeah, exactly.

2320
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:46,600
So on this next clip, Alex is talking, I mean, like, is it?

2321
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:50,280
It's just background dressing that Trump won the election and it was stolen.

2322
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:51,280
Sure.

2323
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:53,680
President Trump, the mainstream media has choreographed all of this.

2324
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,900
They have fraudulently blamed you for COVID-19.

2325
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:57,280
The American people do not believe it.

2326
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,280
They know the truth.

2327
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:02,560
They elect you overwhelmingly and so this new fifth coup of election fraud is designed

2328
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:03,560
to take you out.

2329
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:08,480
If you comply, if you quote, take the olive branch of the neo cons and Mitt Romney and

2330
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:13,120
George W. Bush and say, okay, I'll follow the recommendations of president elect Joe

2331
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:19,240
Biden to lock things down, to wear the mask, to take inoculations and for contact tracers,

2332
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:23,240
they will then turn around later and admit that you were repudiated and the deaths were

2333
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:27,320
your fault and legitimize the persecution of your supporters.

2334
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:30,280
So basically Alex is just being like, for our sake, please seize power.

2335
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:31,280
Yeah.

2336
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:34,960
But also the thing I find most interesting about that is that Alex calls Biden president

2337
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:35,960
elect.

2338
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:36,960
Yeah, I know.

2339
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,960
I feel like he would be more petty than that.

2340
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:39,960
They all know.

2341
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:42,740
I feel like he would be, that's really weird.

2342
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:44,020
They all know.

2343
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:46,440
That's really strange.

2344
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:48,720
I feel like you can do a second take.

2345
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:50,480
I know he's a one take guy.

2346
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:51,480
There are cuts in here.

2347
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:52,480
Oh, there are?

2348
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:53,480
Oh yeah.

2349
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:54,480
Oh my God.

2350
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:57,480
You mispronounced a word fraudulent a couple of times.

2351
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:58,480
Yeah.

2352
01:42:58,480 --> 01:42:59,480
Yeah.

2353
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:00,480
Yeah.

2354
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:01,480
It's not great.

2355
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:02,480
Yeah.

2356
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,440
But even in this message, uh, that is, you know, like I said, there's, there's some editing.

2357
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:07,840
There's some effort that went into this and it's supposed to be like a message directly

2358
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:08,840
to Trump.

2359
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:12,680
There's an elephant in the room that Alex can't even ignore in this message.

2360
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:15,800
And that is the Trump is not being a leader.

2361
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:17,620
We are waiting for leadership.

2362
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:19,880
We need the address from the oval office.

2363
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:24,080
We need you to reconfirm in the face of Fox news and the other sellout traders that you

2364
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:29,960
are never going to concede to fraud and sell out the election system in this country.

2365
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:32,640
We know you're our champion and we stand behind you.

2366
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:35,860
So even that is kind of like a call out a little bit, man.

2367
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:43,000
I feel so like Joe Rogan and Alex, like so many of these people are sitting here being

2368
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,240
like, where's Q, where's Trump?

2369
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:47,240
Where's all this stuff?

2370
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:50,520
And it's like, guys, they weren't your friends.

2371
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:51,520
Yeah.

2372
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:52,680
They've been using you.

2373
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:53,680
Yeah.

2374
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:54,880
I'm the fool here.

2375
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,760
I know you can't admit it, but that's what you got to get.

2376
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:00,720
You just brought up Joe Rogan, so I need to say two things real quick.

2377
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:06,520
Someone sent me a message about Tim Dillon on Joe Rogan's show and they pointed out to

2378
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:12,420
me that Tim Dillon is a sober person, like, or I don't know if like recovery or whatever,

2379
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:16,560
or if he's just straight edge or whatever, so he doesn't drink or smoke.

2380
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:21,880
We were saying that he was high and it was because he had kept saying he was high, but

2381
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:26,040
I realized that what he was probably saying is he's high, like because he's around Alex

2382
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:29,880
or something high on the excitement and I misspoke and I apologize about that.

2383
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:32,720
I didn't mean to imply Tim was high when he wasn't.

2384
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:33,840
I don't know anything about him.

2385
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,640
No, neither do I, and that's why I made that mistake.

2386
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:37,640
Easy to make.

2387
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:38,640
Second.

2388
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:40,360
I'm glad he's an asshole without PEDs.

2389
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:41,360
Second.

2390
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:47,320
I think I had this fantasy that Rogan, like, you know, he's like, I just rationalize having

2391
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:48,320
Alex on my show.

2392
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,320
Sure.

2393
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:53,840
I was thinking about how fun it would be if he's like forced to have Alex's friends on

2394
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:54,840
the show.

2395
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:58,440
It's like, yeah, all right.

2396
01:44:58,440 --> 01:44:59,440
Okay.

2397
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:00,440
You want Alex on there?

2398
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:01,680
You got to bring a Pechenek on there.

2399
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:03,880
Steve Pechenek is going to come fuck with you for a little while.

2400
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:07,800
If you want to say that this guy's sources and shit are backed up and we've got a fact

2401
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:12,640
checker right there, let's bring Dr. Pechenek right next to you and see how that goes.

2402
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:15,720
Next episode, Stuart Rhodes of the Oath Keepers is here.

2403
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:17,560
Let's fucking dance that dance, Joe.

2404
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:19,220
You want to do this, do it.

2405
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:23,080
Next time, Vox Day is coming in.

2406
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:24,080
And now...

2407
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,080
Nick Fuentes.

2408
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:30,360
Florida Congresswoman-elect Laura Loomer is coming up on that.

2409
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:33,280
I don't think it's outside the possibility that Loomer has been on Rogan.

2410
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,280
That doesn't...

2411
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:35,280
I don't think she has.

2412
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:36,280
I don't think so either.

2413
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:37,280
Yeah, I just had that fantasy.

2414
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,360
That seemed pretty fun.

2415
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:40,040
That would be very fun.

2416
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:41,720
Forcing Rogan to have Alex's friends on.

2417
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:42,720
Come on.

2418
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:45,280
If you want to have Alex back again, sit down with these ding-dongs.

2419
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:46,280
Wrestle with that bullshit.

2420
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:49,000
John Rappaport coming on the Rogan Experience.

2421
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,920
Is that Batman appearing from the bushes?

2422
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:57,720
So anyway, Alex brings up a headline in his address to Trump.

2423
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:00,120
This is one of his current talking points.

2424
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:07,120
And now, President Trump, we have the head of the UK military, their Secretary of Defense,

2425
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:13,080
their chairman of their Joint Chiefs, of their defense staff, General Sir Nick Carter, coming

2426
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:18,240
out and saying this lockdown could trigger World War III and there's an extreme danger

2427
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:21,920
of it and that another lockdown is not needed.

2428
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:26,060
So this is a headline of an article that Alex didn't read about an interview with General

2429
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:31,480
Sir Nick Carter on Sky News, where he discussed how the continuing COVID-19 situation and

2430
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:36,560
some of the economic ramifications of it around the world has the potential to exacerbate

2431
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,500
regional conflicts that already exist.

2432
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:43,440
Many people don't feel like regional conflicts are too relevant to their lives, but Carter

2433
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:47,860
was trying to point out that, quote, rhythms of history showed that localized tensions

2434
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:51,320
can easily ratchet up and drag nations to war.

2435
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:55,060
What he was saying is that regional conflict can often escalate when it's miscalculated

2436
01:46:55,060 --> 01:46:56,320
and ignored.

2437
01:46:56,320 --> 01:47:00,560
He said, quote, if you look back at the last century, before both world wars, I think it

2438
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:06,520
was inarguable that there was escalation which led to the miscalculation, which ultimately

2439
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:10,000
led to war at a scale we hopefully never see again.

2440
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,240
His comments weren't meant to imply that dealing with COVID-19 could cause a third world war,

2441
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:18,400
and he never said that measures that Alex would exaggerate into calling lockdowns are

2442
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,880
unnecessary.

2443
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:24,080
That's Alex's imagination about what an article he hasn't read says based on his impression

2444
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,360
of the headline.

2445
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:30,560
The interview is given to celebrate Remembrance Sunday, a UK day of commemoration for the

2446
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:34,400
service persons of their country who participated in the two world wars.

2447
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:38,480
Given this context, the General's comments and the interview made a lot more sense, but

2448
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:42,940
it's exactly this context that Alex makes it his job to deprive his audience of.

2449
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:46,440
It's bad enough when the intended audience is some listener who might buy dumb pills,

2450
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:49,720
but it's another thing when he's imagining that he's conning the president with this

2451
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:51,960
bullshit.

2452
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:53,100
It makes total sense.

2453
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:58,840
This is a Remembrance Sunday interview about these world wars and the concern that regional

2454
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:03,880
conflicts can grow and engulf other people.

2455
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:04,880
Yeah.

2456
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:05,880
Yeah.

2457
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:09,820
I mean, you know, World War One was a rich guy got killed and then a bunch of cousins

2458
01:48:09,820 --> 01:48:12,080
fought each other, you know?

2459
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:14,520
So we have one last clip here, Jordan.

2460
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:18,200
And this is such a metaphor.

2461
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:23,960
This is a audio metaphor for Alex Jones's dumb, dumb message to Trump.

2462
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:28,160
Mike down for this because I want you to experience this in its fullness.

2463
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:32,800
We're still on air at mfullwars.com forward slash show and band.video and we're going

2464
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:38,280
to be making major announcements later this evening about massive caravans from all corners

2465
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:43,920
of the United States, descending on Washington, D.C. in the next few days, led by mfullwars.com

2466
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,960
and more action we're about to take.

2467
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:49,200
Mr. President, we don't just have your back.

2468
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:52,640
Attention business owners, body slammed by overwhelming debt.

2469
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:55,280
Just just amazing.

2470
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:59,660
Just I can't even I can't say enough about that.

2471
01:48:59,660 --> 01:49:05,400
This is a commercial for Four Seasons Land, it would be amazing.

2472
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:07,680
Oh, God, that would have been beautiful.

2473
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:11,640
This is a video that Alex prerecorded so he could leave work early so he could give a

2474
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:14,440
message of desperation to the president.

2475
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:18,720
And it, first of all, ends with a plug for infowars.com forward slash show.

2476
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,720
Of course.

2477
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:22,200
He's plugging that in his message directly to the president.

2478
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:25,560
Well, I mean, if Joe Arpaio is going to plug his book in a message to me.

2479
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:26,560
What a dick.

2480
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:27,560
What a dick.

2481
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:32,720
But that does imply like, OK, the message to Trump part is kind of part of the performance.

2482
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:33,720
Sure.

2483
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,520
I think it's painfully obvious.

2484
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:38,680
And then it's just hilarious that they mistimed it and he got cut off by the break.

2485
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:41,400
You know how long it is.

2486
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:42,400
You do.

2487
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,400
You do.

2488
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:44,400
To the second.

2489
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:45,400
Yes.

2490
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:46,400
It is recorded already.

2491
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:47,400
There's numbers on there.

2492
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:48,400
You can see it.

2493
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,400
Three zero colon zero one.

2494
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:51,400
Yep.

2495
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:54,280
Don't run it till twenty eight fifty.

2496
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:57,800
There's no reason that you need to be getting cut off by the break and your important message

2497
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:58,800
to the president.

2498
01:49:58,800 --> 01:49:59,800
It's just not possible.

2499
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:03,440
It's a recognition that this is performance art for the audience.

2500
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:08,320
And then second, it's also an admission that, like, it's not as important as commercials.

2501
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,320
None of this actually means anything.

2502
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:11,440
We don't really care about getting the whole message in.

2503
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,720
It's kind of just the fact that we did it.

2504
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:14,720
We like.

2505
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:16,120
And hey, Trump, get excited.

2506
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:17,960
These Carol fans are coming.

2507
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:18,960
Great thing to say.

2508
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,900
We've got your back.

2509
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:23,000
Are you having the overwhelming debt?

2510
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:28,840
Just so good, because it's in the statement of we've got your back and then you literally

2511
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:30,680
disappear.

2512
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:31,680
It's just perfect.

2513
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:37,360
Yeah, imagine if you're Trump listening to it, he's like, what else?

2514
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:39,800
Not only do I have your back, what else?

2515
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:41,640
It's an important message.

2516
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:42,640
Pills.

2517
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:43,640
I've got pills.

2518
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:45,240
I got your back and I got pills.

2519
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:52,760
So we come to the end of this and I ought to say, you know, rare need for a Friday episode,

2520
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:54,840
but this caravan demands it.

2521
01:50:54,840 --> 01:51:00,800
I'm excited to follow the adventures of Owen Schroyer across these United States.

2522
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:04,200
I'm excited to see what kind of goofs happen.

2523
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:06,520
I wish I was there desperately.

2524
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:10,120
This caravan has breathed new life into me.

2525
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:11,840
This is very exciting.

2526
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:19,520
And I just, whoever they hire, I know they've got somebody with cameras, you gotta give

2527
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,840
us the raw footage.

2528
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,420
It should be 24-7 filming.

2529
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:27,920
This should be a fucking David Attenborough documentary.

2530
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,160
Like that's what we're dealing with here.

2531
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:34,120
There should be, the bus or whatever they're using to go down there should be like hardwired

2532
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:35,880
video audio at all times.

2533
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:36,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2534
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,080
Werner Herzog is there.

2535
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:40,200
Werner Herzog has to be there.

2536
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:41,200
Yeah.

2537
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:46,320
The potential for this just to be an amazing story that might never get told, it's too

2538
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:47,320
high.

2539
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:48,320
It's too high.

2540
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,320
I know.

2541
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:50,320
I know.

2542
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:51,320
Oh, dude.

2543
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:52,320
Well, we'll do our best.

2544
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:53,960
Yes, we got this.

2545
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:54,960
And we'll see you then.

2546
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:55,960
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

2547
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:56,960
We do have a website.

2548
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:57,960
It's knowledgefight.com.

2549
01:51:57,960 --> 01:51:58,960
Yep, or also on Twitter.

2550
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:02,060
It's at knowledge

2551
01:52:02,060 --> 01:52:04,920
We are Facebook.

2552
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:09,020
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

2553
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:10,020
doing God's work.

2554
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:11,020
Yep.

2555
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:12,020
We'll be back.

2556
01:52:12,020 --> 01:52:13,020
But until then, I'm Neo.

2557
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:14,020
I'm Leo.

2558
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:15,020
I'm DZX Clark.

2559
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:16,020
I'm Darryl Arundus.

2560
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:18,600
I think it's totally fine if you watch Dancing with the Stars.

2561
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:19,600
Andy in Kansas.

2562
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:20,600
You're on the air.

2563
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:21,600
Thanks for holding.

2564
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:22,600
Hello, Alex.

2565
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:23,600
I'm a first time caller.

2566
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:24,600
I'm a huge fan.

2567
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:25,600
I love your work.

2568
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:30,600
I love you.
