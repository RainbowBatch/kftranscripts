00:00.000 --> 00:12.880
N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.880 --> 00:19.520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.320 --> 00:25.120
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.280
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys, knowledge

00:29.280 --> 00:30.280
fight.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.040
Dan and Jordan, knowledge fight.

00:32.040 --> 00:39.280
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her, riddle her, riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

00:39.280 --> 00:46.480
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and, stop it, Andy and, Andy and, Andy and, it's time

00:46.480 --> 00:47.480
to pray.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.480
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us.

00:49.480 --> 00:53.280
Hello Alex, I'm a fifth-time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work.

00:53.280 --> 00:59.440
Knowledgefight.com, knowledgefight.com, I love you.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.360
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan, I'm Jordan, we're a couple of dudes

01:02.360 --> 01:05.400
that like to sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex

01:05.400 --> 01:06.400
Jones.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.400
Oh indeed we are Dan.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.400
Jordan.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.400
Dan.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.400
Jordan.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.400
I have a quick question for you.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.400
Sure.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.400
What's your bright spot today?

01:13.400 --> 01:15.360
My bright spot today, now spoiler alert to everybody out there listening, we just recorded

01:15.360 --> 01:18.440
our bright spots and realized that it was not recorded.

01:18.440 --> 01:19.440
Had not started the recording yet.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.440
The thing had not recorded.

01:20.440 --> 01:21.440
It's crucially recorded.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.440
I hit the button.

01:22.440 --> 01:23.440
It didn't start recording.

01:23.440 --> 01:24.440
I'm not saying that I didn't.

01:24.440 --> 01:25.440
And it didn't start recording.

01:25.440 --> 01:26.440
I'm not saying that I disbelieve you.

01:26.440 --> 01:29.000
So we're gonna share our bright spots with each other for a second time, so if any of

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
this sounds insincere.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
It's a little bit weird to do it twice in a row.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
There were some great rips.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Totally.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
You guys missed out on gold.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.920
And now I feel like I can't bring any, oh god.

01:38.920 --> 01:41.040
No, it's tough to bring the same energy now.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.040
I know.

01:42.040 --> 01:44.160
Anyway, my bright spot is world music.

01:44.160 --> 01:49.240
Actually, on the second time that is funnier.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.240
Yeah.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.240
It's not that funny.

01:51.240 --> 01:56.840
I'm just worried, like I told you earlier on the first time, that I'm worried that I'm

01:56.840 --> 02:02.400
becoming my parents, because they used to have a lot of interest in a lot of music from

02:02.400 --> 02:08.840
around the world, particularly this band, Yuthu Yindi, which is a lot of synth and also

02:08.840 --> 02:13.720
tribal sounds from Oceania.

02:13.720 --> 02:20.080
And yeah, it was a running joke throughout our family, but I was on Spotify getting some

02:20.080 --> 02:22.400
work done for the episode.

02:22.400 --> 02:26.360
Just like to put on music in the background while I'm like researching and reading up

02:26.360 --> 02:27.360
on stuff.

02:27.360 --> 02:28.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:28.360 --> 02:32.880
And I always like to let them see what you got.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.520
They know what I've listened to.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.520
Let's see if you can hit a home run.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.000
I don't trust nobody.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
And there was some music from Malawi that ended up coming up, and I really, really enjoyed

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
it.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.080
And I'm worried this is going to set me off on a path of just like getting into all sorts

02:49.080 --> 02:51.800
of stuff from around the world, which isn't the worst thing ever.

02:51.800 --> 02:52.800
Nothing.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.800
No, no, no.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.800
Orchestra Baobab is great.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.800
You should try them out.

02:55.800 --> 02:56.800
They're fantastic.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.800
Writing this down.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.880
Yeah, there's all kinds of great African music.

02:59.880 --> 03:05.160
I think it's a little bit cliche to reference them because they're probably...

03:05.160 --> 03:06.160
Or maybe not.

03:06.160 --> 03:09.840
Maybe no one has any idea about them except for in the weird circles that I live in.

03:09.840 --> 03:10.840
That might be.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.760
Oh, it's so cliche to reference Orchestra Baobab.

03:13.760 --> 03:14.760
You know the thing everyone knows about.

03:14.760 --> 03:19.320
Well, I mean, on one of our bonus episodes, we did talk about your love of really obscure

03:19.320 --> 03:20.320
music.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.000
So you can't tell who knows what.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.320
I have no idea.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.320
Yeah.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.600
Yeah, so this might be a new little bit of an auditory adventure for me.

03:27.600 --> 03:31.880
I'm excited to embark on it and find out what the rest of the world has to offer in terms

03:31.880 --> 03:32.880
of sounds.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.480
A lot of great music out there.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.480
Awesome.

03:35.480 --> 03:36.480
What about you?

03:36.480 --> 03:37.480
What's your bright spot?

03:37.480 --> 03:39.120
My bright spot, Dan, is Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.400
It's a fantastic game.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.400
I enjoyed it.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.680
I want to say that I already knew that the first time around.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.640
You already knew that before I had even said it the first time.

03:46.640 --> 03:47.640
Right.

03:47.640 --> 03:48.640
Now it's the second time I'm totally not surprised.

03:48.640 --> 03:49.640
Twice as boring.

03:49.640 --> 03:50.640
Twice as boring.

03:50.640 --> 03:51.640
Not bored.

03:51.640 --> 03:52.640
Not interested.

03:52.640 --> 03:53.640
Just not surprised.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.640
You even already know the story that my bright spot is, so it's not even an interesting story.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.640
But I also knew that because you texted me about it before the first time we recorded

03:58.640 --> 03:59.640
it.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.640
Exactly.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.640
All of this is terrible for you.

04:01.640 --> 04:02.640
You're bored by it.

04:02.640 --> 04:03.640
Please.

04:03.640 --> 04:04.640
My bright spot is a video game.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.640
Is that what you wanted to hear, Dan?

04:05.640 --> 04:07.440
No, I'm thrilled for you, because it's been a long time coming.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.040
You're very excited about this game, as you should be.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.520
Yeah, it's my favorite series.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.440
And I had originally ordered it.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.680
I found out on the 9th that my copy wouldn't have rised.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.520
I ordered a physical copy, like a boron, and it wouldn't have rised.

04:18.520 --> 04:20.160
Well, you're a man of a certain age.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.160
It wouldn't have rised.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.440
Yes, I have reached that time.

04:24.440 --> 04:28.680
Your console age, your cartridge age, game cartridge age.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.560
I still blow on the DVDs, just in case.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.560
Smart.

04:32.560 --> 04:33.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:33.560 --> 04:34.560
It's very smart.

04:34.560 --> 04:39.560
Yeah, no, and it wasn't going to show up until the 17th, so on the 9th I was like, fuck this.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.680
It was 7 o'clock.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.760
It was going to be available at 11.

04:43.760 --> 04:49.160
So I scrambled and got the download copy as soon as I possibly could, and all troubles

04:49.160 --> 04:50.160
were averted.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.160
It's perfect.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.160
Yeah, you got to.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.160
I mean, it's going to be another week for that thing to show up.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.160
No, can't do it.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.160
Can't do it.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.160
Yeah.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.160
No, no, no.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.160
People are going to say stuff like, it was good.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.160
Spoilers.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.160
Yeah, and I'm like, no.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.520
I must experience it fresh.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.860
I must be part of the zeitgeist.

05:04.860 --> 05:13.160
So I've been busy, because the show and what have you, and sort of other related projects,

05:13.160 --> 05:18.080
and so I haven't had a lot of time to play it, but I did pre-order a digital copy myself,

05:18.080 --> 05:19.320
and I did play a little bit.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.320
Like a genius.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.320
I played a little bit the other night.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.720
I've not gotten very far into it, and I'm concerned.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.320
Now here's why.

05:26.320 --> 05:33.760
I don't know a lot about Norse and Viking stuff, whereas other iterations of the game

05:33.760 --> 05:38.480
were like sort of mythologies and cultural histories that I know a little bit more about.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.200
Greece is your wheelhouse.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.200
Like right up your alley.

05:41.200 --> 05:46.020
Even the one before it was Egypt, and I know a bit about Egyptian history.

05:46.020 --> 05:50.080
I know very little, and I realized why.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.280
It's those letters.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.280
It's the letters.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.280
The ruins.

05:53.280 --> 05:59.300
No, I just can't handle the weird combination of letters and the names and stuff.

05:59.300 --> 06:06.360
It intimidates me, and I don't know what to do with those Vs and Js and Ys and Gs everywhere.

06:06.360 --> 06:07.360
It scares me.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.360
I don't know what to do.

06:08.360 --> 06:09.360
Ah, come on.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.360
It's fine.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.360
It's hard.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.360
It's Elvish.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.360
You're fine.

06:13.360 --> 06:16.320
It's very difficult for me, and I realize that subconscious bias has kept me away, whereas

06:16.320 --> 06:21.040
I'm excited to embark on a little bit of this, find out some stuff that I can then maybe

06:21.040 --> 06:23.360
read up on the real versions of.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.360
And then I also-

06:24.360 --> 06:29.160
I think what's really funny about that is having played just a little bit further into

06:29.160 --> 06:34.320
the game than you, after the title card, which is four hours, five hours into that-

06:34.320 --> 06:35.920
I've not even come close to that, I'm sure.

06:35.920 --> 06:36.920
You go to England.

06:36.920 --> 06:37.920
What?

06:37.920 --> 06:38.920
Spoilers.

06:38.920 --> 06:39.920
All of your worries-

06:39.920 --> 06:40.920
Spoilers.

06:40.920 --> 06:45.280
It's funny to me that you're like, oh, I'm worried about the ruins, and I'm like, dude,

06:45.280 --> 06:47.660
three hours from now you won't even see a ruin.

06:47.660 --> 06:48.660
You're fine.

06:48.660 --> 06:49.660
Wow.

06:49.660 --> 06:50.660
I'm a little disappointed.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.660
No, it's going to be great.

06:51.660 --> 06:52.660
It's awesome.

06:52.660 --> 06:57.640
But the other thing, that actually kind of puts to bed my other worry about the game,

06:57.640 --> 07:03.400
having again played very little of it, I'm worried it's too white, but not in white people

07:03.400 --> 07:04.400
way.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.400
Sure, sure, sure.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.400
I mean snow.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.400
It's very snow.

07:07.400 --> 07:12.280
There's so much goddamn snow around, it's visually monochromatic to a level that if

07:12.280 --> 07:15.840
it were the entire game, I would have a problem with that.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.880
I think it would be a difficulty.

07:18.880 --> 07:22.280
Because of the open world exploration aspect, if you're just running around and everywhere

07:22.280 --> 07:24.960
is snow covered, it becomes a bummer.

07:24.960 --> 07:30.560
No, even with Witcher 3, it wasn't gloomy all the time, it was gloomy most of the time.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.560
And there were sort of variations to the gloom.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:33.860 --> 07:36.240
There's light gloom, dark gloom, you got them.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.920
Well, I'm glad to know that some of these concerns that I have, whether it be letter

07:39.920 --> 07:40.920
or snow-based.

07:40.920 --> 07:41.920
Or weather, yeah.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.760
Letter or weather, it's still a good game.

07:44.760 --> 07:51.880
I trust the developers of those games enough to not make a game that's all snow.

07:51.880 --> 07:57.040
I figured it would be such an elementary kind of thing.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.440
Rogue was, did you ever play Assassin's Creed Rogue?

07:59.440 --> 08:00.440
I did not.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.000
Yeah, that one's mainly snow, so you skipped that one for good.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Skip it.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Yeah, skip it.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
That one's out of here.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
I don't mind a little snow.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Anyway.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
You live in Illinois, you don't mind a little snow.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
A little bit.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
I live through snowpocalypse.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.840
Yeah, we've been here, wow, come on.

08:13.840 --> 08:18.960
So Jordan, today we're getting back into the present, we're going to be talking about November

08:18.960 --> 08:19.960
7th and 8th, 2020.

08:19.960 --> 08:20.960
I'm Dan, this is 2020.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.320
Oh, god damn it.

08:22.320 --> 08:26.840
We're entering that interesting period where we find out what Alex does during the 79 days

08:26.840 --> 08:27.840
of hell.

08:27.840 --> 08:28.840
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:28.840 --> 08:34.480
On our last episode, we experienced what happened when Alex left and Steve Pachanik tried to

08:34.480 --> 08:37.720
throw a wrench in the gears.

08:37.720 --> 08:44.240
Today we jump in and I guess we're just pretending none of this shit happened.

08:44.240 --> 08:49.960
I was born in 1783, my father was a Highlander and so am I.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.200
I had to kill him, there can be only one!

08:52.200 --> 08:58.360
I don't know exactly how we're doing it, but I guess we're just pretending that never happened.

08:58.360 --> 09:03.420
And we're here on Saturday, Alex is doing a broadcast on Saturday the 7th and then his

09:03.420 --> 09:06.560
show on Sunday the 8th.

09:06.560 --> 09:09.880
And yeah, we'll see, we'll see what's going on.

09:09.880 --> 09:10.880
Alright.

09:10.880 --> 09:11.880
He's a weird dude.

09:11.880 --> 09:12.880
I like it.

09:12.880 --> 09:13.880
Yeah.

09:13.880 --> 09:14.880
I like it.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.360
But before we get down to business on that, let's take a moment to say thank you to some

09:16.360 --> 09:18.360
folks who have signed up on our sporting show.

09:18.360 --> 09:22.240

09:24.520 --> 09:25.520
Thank you.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.100
Next, Burt G, thank you so much, you're now a policy wonk.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.120
I'm a policy wonk.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.120
Thanks Burt.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.120
Thank you Burt.

09:31.120 --> 09:34.560

09:35.560 --> 09:36.880
Thank you very much Jared.

09:36.880 --> 09:37.600
Thank you!

09:37.600 --> 09:42.720
Next Stu and Ger, Engerur, Engerrr standing.

09:42.720 --> 09:47.600
Stu and Ger, thank you so much You are now a policy wonk.

09:47.600 --> 09:48.600
I'm a policy wonk.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.600
Thank you so much.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.600
Stu.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.600
Stu.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.040
Next, Philbin.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.040
Thank you so much.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.040
You are now a policy wonk.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.040
I'm a policy wonk.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.040
Thanks, Philbin.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.040
Thank you, Philbin.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.560
And then finally, I'd like to give a shout out to a couple of folks who donated on an

10:00.560 --> 10:01.560
elevated level.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.620
We appreciate that very much.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.160
So first of all, HB.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.160
Thank you so much.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.160
You are now a technocrat.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.440
Fernando F. Thank you so much.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.640
You are now a technocrat.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.480
And don't go into the forest.

10:10.480 --> 10:11.480
Thank you so much.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.480
You are now a technocrat.

10:12.480 --> 10:13.480
I'm a policy wonk.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.480
Crikey, mate.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.480
That's fantastic.

10:15.480 --> 10:16.480
Have yourself a brew.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.480
Thank you.

10:17.480 --> 10:18.480
How's your 401k doing, bro?

10:18.480 --> 10:19.480
All right.

10:19.480 --> 10:20.480
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.480
All right.

10:21.480 --> 10:22.480
Let's just get down to business.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.480
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

10:24.480 --> 10:26.400
Why are you pimps so good?

10:26.400 --> 10:28.040
My neck is freakishly large.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.720
I declare info war on you.

10:30.720 --> 10:31.720
Thanks so much, HB.

10:31.720 --> 10:32.720
Thanks so much, Fernando.

10:32.720 --> 10:33.720
Thank you so much.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.720
Don't go into the forest.

10:34.720 --> 10:35.720
Yes.

10:35.720 --> 10:36.720
Thank you very much.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.720
All of you.

10:37.720 --> 10:41.240
I would like to, first of all, encourage anybody to have a donor name that is an ominous warning.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.240
Oh, yeah.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.240
I enjoy that.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.240
Which forest?

10:44.240 --> 10:45.240
Exactly.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.240
That's an issue.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.160
If you're out there listening and thinking, hey, I enjoy this show, I'd like to support

10:49.160 --> 10:50.160
these gents.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.640
You can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com, clicking the button that says support the

10:52.640 --> 10:53.640
show.

10:53.640 --> 10:54.640
We would appreciate it.

10:54.640 --> 10:57.240
We would love it, but do not go to Schwarzwandt.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.240
That's the Black Forest.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.240
Oh, okay.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.240
What else could people do?

11:01.240 --> 11:04.720
Well, you know what, Dan?

11:04.720 --> 11:12.680
Some people could absolutely be filled with that generous spirit and want to give or donate

11:12.680 --> 11:17.160
to someone, but then realize that they would have to wait a week to deal with that.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.160
Oh, yeah.

11:18.160 --> 11:22.240
You just can't wait a week because the generous spirit is so strong within you.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.760
Find a way to get that money out now, Dan.

11:24.760 --> 11:25.760
To a local charity.

11:25.760 --> 11:26.760
Yeah, exactly.

11:26.760 --> 11:27.760
Yeah, yeah.

11:27.760 --> 11:28.760
Nailed it.

11:28.760 --> 11:29.760
Thanks, Dan.

11:29.760 --> 11:34.200
I was worried it was going to end in Yggdrasil or some nonsense.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.480
Not that that's nonsense, but whatever.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.480
You know what I'm saying.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.480
Sure, I get you.

11:38.480 --> 11:41.360
So, Jordan, before we begin, here's an out of context drop from today's show.

11:41.360 --> 11:48.160
I mean, it's like when you watch Dancing with the Stars in the final episode or whatever,

11:48.160 --> 11:52.280
because I'm not a big TV guy, but I do like watching good looking women dance.

11:52.280 --> 11:55.800
And when it's cool to watch the guys and all of it, it's really cool.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.240
It's cool to see celebrities dance.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.240
I mean, it's fun.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.240
Okay.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.240
You can't.

12:00.240 --> 12:03.400
You don't need to justify why you watch a TV show.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.640
This is a problem with being on the far right.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.320
You can't just enjoy what you enjoy.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.240
You have to fight for it.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.240
Yeah.

12:10.240 --> 12:14.320
I got tricked because Sean Spicer was on, and I watched it, and hey, some of the chicks

12:14.320 --> 12:15.320
were hot.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.320
Whatever.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.800
Actually, I don't even like the dancing at all.

12:18.800 --> 12:22.800
The way that they get pirouette, and the throws, and the...

12:22.800 --> 12:26.080
It seems unmanly for me to enjoy watching people dance.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.080
Exactly.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.080
Isn't that what he just said?

12:28.080 --> 12:29.080
More or less.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.080
That's exactly what he just said.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.080
Yeah, it's so sad.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.320
I'm insecure about watching dance.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.720
Enjoy what you enjoy.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.720
Right?

12:35.720 --> 12:36.720
Anyway, here we go.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.000
We're jumping in on the seventh Saturday.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Alex's day off.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Sure.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Yeah.

12:41.000 --> 12:47.080
Back from his trip to Phoenix, where he yelled into an adult-sized bullhorn, and, hey, man,

12:47.080 --> 12:51.960
if Biden's really president, which it looks like he is, Alex has bad news.

12:51.960 --> 12:52.960
Uh-oh.

12:52.960 --> 13:00.040
It is Saturday, November 7th, the year is 2020, and if we accept the false claims of

13:00.040 --> 13:04.120
Joe Biden and his communist Chinese deep state handlers that he is the president with the

13:04.120 --> 13:10.120
fraud we've just witnessed, then you could really see this as a good day to put on the

13:10.120 --> 13:21.040
Republic's tombstone, born July 4th, 1776, died November 7th, 2020.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.040
That's what this is.

13:22.040 --> 13:27.800
Alex has called it Death of America, November 7th, 2020.

13:27.800 --> 13:34.480
As a millionaire, I can tell you that the tragedy of the Biden administration will be

13:34.480 --> 13:39.960
that they raised the marginal income tax on individuals making over $500,000 a year to

13:39.960 --> 13:44.120
above 35%, Dan, and that is the end of the Republic.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.120
What's that I hear?

13:45.120 --> 13:50.120
I think that's the church bells ringing for the funeral of America.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.120
That's it.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.120
It's going to go back up to 44%.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.120
Yeah.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.040
Can you imagine how angry 2 Chainz is going to be then?

13:55.040 --> 13:56.040
So mad.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.040
He's so mad.

13:57.040 --> 14:02.040
In this next clip, we learn, look, this is the problem that I have.

14:02.040 --> 14:05.160
He starts off the show talking about put this date on America's tombstone.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.160
Sure.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.160
Then he says things like this.

14:07.160 --> 14:11.240
And we can talk all day about the failures of Trump and why this was able to happen.

14:11.240 --> 14:15.000
We can talk about what Trump should have done better, and we're going to do that so we don't

14:15.000 --> 14:16.240
make the mistakes next time.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.240
What next time?

14:17.240 --> 14:19.480
What the fuck next time?

14:19.480 --> 14:21.760
According to Alex, there is no next time.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.920
This isn't just a political party that you disagree with that now has control of the

14:24.920 --> 14:26.680
executive branch of the government.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.920
This is the fucking devil taking over.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.760
Without Trump there to stop them, the story is supposed to be that there's nothing to

14:32.760 --> 14:36.320
protect the Patriots from getting rounded up and the entire world being killed off with

14:36.320 --> 14:41.400
a super bio weapon, a false flag ice age, or maybe nukes, depending on what Alex is

14:41.400 --> 14:42.400
feeling that day.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.640
Chicago's gone for sure.

14:44.640 --> 14:48.840
It's downright insulting for Alex to have the nerve to act like a political commentator

14:48.840 --> 14:52.200
right now when his candidate has been projected to lose.

14:52.200 --> 14:55.880
He has this tantrum about the death of the Republic being on November 7th and immediately

14:55.880 --> 14:59.340
gets into the mode you'd expect to see on regular outlets.

14:59.340 --> 15:01.880
They're doing a post mortem on the campaign.

15:01.880 --> 15:03.520
Where were the flaws in the strategy?

15:03.520 --> 15:04.800
Where is there room for improvements?

15:04.800 --> 15:05.880
We can do better next time.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.200
Let's talk midterms.

15:07.200 --> 15:11.380
Normal people get to do that because they don't live in an artificial reality they use

15:11.380 --> 15:15.920
to abuse their audiences, where if their guy loses the election, pedophile demons will

15:15.920 --> 15:19.480
run the street and God's fire filled judgment will be upon us.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.680
Alex doesn't get to wargame about the midterms.

15:21.680 --> 15:26.280
He lost that right when he made the terms of this election supernatural.

15:26.280 --> 15:32.840
Yeah I believe it was if Biden wins, they're going to switch to plan B and kill all of

15:32.840 --> 15:33.840
us immediately.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.400
They're not even going to give us the three years?

15:35.400 --> 15:37.240
That wasn't even conditional on the election.

15:37.240 --> 15:41.520
That was just something Alex said they'd decided to do because Alex is too effective.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.520
He was in a bad mood.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.520
I gotcha.

15:43.520 --> 15:48.320
The Infowar is too strong so they're gonna just kill us off instead of the fun ordered

15:48.320 --> 15:51.680
killing us off that they like to do because the devil loves plans.

15:51.680 --> 15:55.600
I don't even think that's, you know what, there's nothing to be ashamed about in losing

15:55.600 --> 15:56.600
to the devil.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.880
You're supposed to lose to the devil.

15:57.880 --> 16:01.160
The only person who wins against the devil is Jesus, man.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.160
Well, and Johnny.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.160
Oh well, Johnny does too.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.720
He rosined up that bow and played his fiddle hard.

16:04.720 --> 16:05.720
I gotcha.

16:05.720 --> 16:06.720
So we got two.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.720
Yeah.

16:07.720 --> 16:08.720
Alright.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.880
And Johnny was really a Christ metaphor.

16:10.880 --> 16:13.480
And honestly, it was more of a single issue thing.

16:13.480 --> 16:16.560
That wasn't a real, like, he wasn't trying to change the whole world.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.560
Right.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.040
It was really just about fiddle playing.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.560
It was mainly fiddling, yes.

16:21.560 --> 16:24.200
The devil acts with honor in fiddle contests.

16:24.200 --> 16:28.040
Well, if you count, like, the other ripoff songs of The Devil Went Down to Georgia, then

16:28.040 --> 16:32.300
I think some other people might have been the devil too, because there's other versions.

16:32.300 --> 16:36.440
There was at least one juggler who went down to Georgia.

16:36.440 --> 16:39.960
Our friend Marty DeRosa informed me of the song, like, The Devil Went Down to Detroit,

16:39.960 --> 16:40.960
I think.

16:40.960 --> 16:41.960
I believe that's the name of it.

16:41.960 --> 16:42.960
It's like a rap version.

16:42.960 --> 16:43.960
Sure.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.760
And these guys have, like, a DJ contest with the devil.

16:45.760 --> 16:46.760
I think they win.

16:46.760 --> 16:47.760
Okay.

16:47.760 --> 16:48.760
I don't know.

16:48.760 --> 16:50.440
Look, a lot of people may have fictitiously beat the devil.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.440
But look.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.440
I'm sort of saying it.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.480
There's no shame in that.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.600
You're not supposed to beat the devil.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.600
Right.

16:55.600 --> 16:56.600
Why are you beating yourself up over this?

16:56.600 --> 16:58.360
I don't know if he's beating himself up by it.

16:58.360 --> 16:59.360
Oh, that's fair.

16:59.360 --> 17:03.340
I want to stress one of the compelling reasons not to respect Alex Jones.

17:03.340 --> 17:05.300
He is an intellectual coward.

17:05.300 --> 17:09.400
He can't stand to be wrong to such a ridiculous extent that he set up this election as a battle

17:09.400 --> 17:12.600
between good and evil, which evil could not possibly win.

17:12.600 --> 17:17.100
And even if they did, good secretly actually won because evil cheated in a way that's never

17:17.100 --> 17:18.720
going to be proven.

17:18.720 --> 17:22.800
Now that the supposedly evil side has won, Alex won't even stick to his own parameters

17:22.800 --> 17:25.880
and act like the literal devil just beat his hero.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.920
Alex doesn't even have the integrity to present for a minute that any of the stuff he was

17:28.920 --> 17:32.560
screaming about and fake crying about on air means anything.

17:32.560 --> 17:35.700
Because it's time to move on and learn the lessons of the last election and apply them

17:35.700 --> 17:39.400
to whatever white supremacist he supports next time because they insist they're just

17:39.400 --> 17:40.400
a nationalist.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.880
He's a child.

17:41.880 --> 17:47.360
This more than many other moments is a very clear and unmistakable instance of retreat.

17:47.360 --> 17:50.160
Get the fuck out of here with that learning lessons for next time shit.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.680
You don't get to do that.

17:51.680 --> 17:52.680
Nope.

17:52.680 --> 17:53.680
Nope.

17:53.680 --> 17:54.680
Other people get to do that.

17:54.680 --> 17:55.680
I resent that.

17:55.680 --> 18:00.160
Honestly, there are very few situations where I don't think now that many of these people

18:00.160 --> 18:04.720
are private citizens, we should spit on them every single time they go outside.

18:04.720 --> 18:08.240
Like there's no way Alex should not be spit on regularly.

18:08.240 --> 18:15.040
There's no way that like fucking, if Trump walks down fucking a street in Manhattan,

18:15.040 --> 18:18.680
he should be spit on by thousands of people on a constant daily basis.

18:18.680 --> 18:19.680
Yeah.

18:19.680 --> 18:23.720
I think that you could make an argument that spitting is a form of assault and maybe I'm

18:23.720 --> 18:24.840
not into that.

18:24.840 --> 18:25.840
Fair.

18:25.840 --> 18:26.840
Yelling is better.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.120
I'll go with you as far as yelling.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.280
You'll go with me as far as yelling.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.280
Tiny bullhorning.

18:31.280 --> 18:32.280
All right.

18:32.280 --> 18:33.280
Okay.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.280
Tiny bullhorning.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.280
Tiny bullhorning.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.280
Anytime Alex leaves his house, people, a crew of-

18:36.280 --> 18:38.720
He should be surrounded with tiny bullhorners.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.280
I think they're, I think you're right.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.280
Yes.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.680
The spitting on people I think is a little bit gross.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.520
Well, now it's definitely attempted murder.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.520
Certainly in an age of COVID.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:46.520 --> 18:47.520
That's fair.

18:47.520 --> 18:51.240
You know, you don't want to sort of express support for that kind of behavior.

18:51.240 --> 18:52.240
Right.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.240
Right, right, right.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.240
Aim away from him.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.240
Yeah.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.240
Yelling with a tiny bullhorn through your mask.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.240
I like it.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.240
I like it.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.240
That's perfectly-

18:59.240 --> 19:00.240
That's safe.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.240
Yeah.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.240
I think that's-

19:02.240 --> 19:03.240
I think that's good.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.240
That's the middle ground.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.240
What I'm saying is these people should be hounded to the ends of the earth.

19:05.240 --> 19:06.240
Yeah.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.240
Yeah.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.240
Bark at people through bullhorns.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.240
Yeah.

19:09.240 --> 19:10.240
I like it.

19:10.240 --> 19:15.120
So Alex has a concern that a lot of his, you know, everyone's getting censored.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.120
Everyone's getting kicked off.

19:16.120 --> 19:19.720
All the patriots are being taken off all social media platforms.

19:19.720 --> 19:20.720
Sure.

19:20.720 --> 19:25.480
And you see the mass censorship now, as we predicted, almost total censorship.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.680
No media that I saw carrying Giuliani's press conference.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.220
Thank God there's right side broadcasting.

19:30.220 --> 19:32.280
Thank God there's info wars picking it back up.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.200
Thank God you're out there amplifying it.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.800
But this is a serious war.

19:36.800 --> 19:41.320
So yeah, man, everyone's getting taken down, except for people like info wars and right

19:41.320 --> 19:46.800
side broadcasting that'll stand up and cover Rudy Giuliani's wonderful press conference.

19:46.800 --> 19:47.800
Somebody's gotta-

19:47.800 --> 19:52.000
I would suspect that most media outlets, if they didn't, they didn't cover Rudy Giuliani's

19:52.000 --> 19:55.800
press conference out of respect for him, since that shit was super embarrassing.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.640
Also, it wasn't censored.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.720
People were making fun of it all over the place.

19:59.720 --> 20:00.720
Yeah.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.020
This was, of course, the Four Seasons press conference.

20:03.020 --> 20:06.600
As best as anyone can tell, someone in the campaign may have thought that they booked

20:06.600 --> 20:11.320
the Four Seasons hotel conference room for the presser, but it actually set up an event

20:11.320 --> 20:15.720
in front of a small landscaping company called Four Seasons Total Landscaping.

20:15.720 --> 20:19.700
I have no idea what actually happened here, if they intended it to be there or if someone

20:19.700 --> 20:22.840
screwed up, but it was pretty hilarious.

20:22.840 --> 20:26.760
Giuliani gave a rambling nonsense speech right at the moment when the networks called the

20:26.760 --> 20:27.760
race for Biden.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.760
Ooh.

20:28.760 --> 20:29.760
It was a total mess.

20:29.760 --> 20:30.760
Oh, brutal.

20:30.760 --> 20:35.360
At the event, one of Giuliani's guests was an alleged poll watcher named Darryl Brooks,

20:35.360 --> 20:40.800
who turned out to also have been, quote, incarcerated in the 1990s on charges of sexual assault,

20:40.800 --> 20:45.440
lewdness, and endangering the welfare of a minor by exposing himself to two girls ages

20:45.440 --> 20:46.440
seven and 11.

20:46.440 --> 20:49.160
Ah, it's a false flag Democrat, if I ever heard one.

20:49.160 --> 20:53.320
Well, according to an article in The Cut, quote, Brooks denied the charges and said

20:53.320 --> 20:54.680
his arrest was a police setup.

20:54.680 --> 20:55.680
Oh.

20:55.680 --> 20:56.680
So-

20:56.680 --> 20:57.680
There we go.

20:57.680 --> 20:58.680
Claims of false flag-

20:58.680 --> 20:59.680
So it's a double false flag.

20:59.680 --> 21:00.680
Perhaps.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.640
That's what led into becoming the false flag.

21:02.640 --> 21:03.640
That's what happened.

21:03.640 --> 21:04.640
I don't know.

21:04.640 --> 21:05.640
Ah, must be.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.920
Anyway, because this guy is somebody who's identifiable, it makes things a little bit

21:08.920 --> 21:12.320
more confusing for the claims that were being made at this press conference.

21:12.320 --> 21:17.560
Apparently, it was being alleged that Brooks was a poll watcher in Philadelphia and not

21:17.560 --> 21:22.080
being allowed in to check the rolls and everything.

21:22.080 --> 21:27.160
But he lives in New Jersey, and it's not like he's a low profile New Jersey resident.

21:27.160 --> 21:32.800
An article in Politico quoted Reed Giscoria, the mayor of Trenton, New Jersey, as describing

21:32.800 --> 21:38.280
Brooks as, quote, New Jersey's perennial candidate, because Brooks had run from many different

21:38.280 --> 21:41.520
offices in New Jersey, including the Senate and House.

21:41.520 --> 21:42.520
Wow.

21:42.520 --> 21:46.160
The state of Pennsylvania requires poll watchers to be registered voters in the counties they

21:46.160 --> 21:51.360
wish to poll watch, so he couldn't have actually been in a position to actually make the claims

21:51.360 --> 21:52.440
that he was making.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.440
Right, right, right, right.

21:53.440 --> 21:58.640
This whole thing was a disaster for Giuliani, from the strange location to the almost comically

21:58.640 --> 22:03.440
bad timing to the poll watcher alleged who he had as a witness who couldn't possibly

22:03.440 --> 22:06.720
be a poll watcher but is actually a convicted child abuser.

22:06.720 --> 22:11.000
If anything, I would expect Alex to want less coverage of this.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.160
Everything is bad.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.480
Every element of that press conference was bad.

22:14.480 --> 22:21.960
Yeah, I mean, but that's a perfect example of how we are held hostage by their unreality.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.440
That should be a criminal offense.

22:24.440 --> 22:29.640
All the stuff that happened at that presser, I know they're not illegal, but if you do

22:29.640 --> 22:33.360
that, you should be like, you can't be near other people.

22:33.360 --> 22:34.360
Tiny bullhorns.

22:34.360 --> 22:35.440
You're going to get someone hurt.

22:35.440 --> 22:40.520
We need crews of people with tiny bullhorns on the ready.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.460
That's what Arkham Asylum is for.

22:42.460 --> 22:48.880
People who accidentally scheduled press conferences in front of the Four Seasons fucking...

22:48.880 --> 22:49.880
Flamescaping.

22:49.880 --> 22:51.040
Yeah, exactly.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.400
That's Arkham.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.720
It's not a crime.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.160
It's something that people need to be kept there.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.160
Imagine.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.160
You got the Joker.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.160
You got Killer Croc.

23:01.160 --> 23:03.560
You got Rudy Giuliani.

23:03.560 --> 23:04.560
Why are you here?

23:04.560 --> 23:06.400
I set up a weird press conference.

23:06.400 --> 23:10.000
They would all be like, yeah, no, you're the only one we're not letting escape.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.400
You're too gone for us.

23:11.400 --> 23:14.600
Whenever the Riddler comes and lets everyone out, he leaves Rudy.

23:14.600 --> 23:15.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:15.800 --> 23:19.680
At least we get the place we're going to heist right, okay?

23:19.680 --> 23:25.280
Batman doesn't beat us there because we got to the wrong place, okay?

23:25.280 --> 23:29.400
They're like, oh, no, no, no, Rudy, you got to stay here to give a message to the Bat

23:29.400 --> 23:30.400
for us.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.400
Give a press conference.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.400
Outside of Arkham Asylum.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.400
Yeah.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.400
Yeah.

23:35.400 --> 23:36.400
Ugh.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.400
God.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.400
What an asshole.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.400
Yep.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.400
Jesus.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.920
So Alex gets to talking about the China.

23:42.920 --> 23:50.160
He has this interesting idea that isn't based in really anything, but I got really lost

23:50.160 --> 23:55.720
in thought after listening to this clip because I think it's really a really good example

23:55.720 --> 24:01.760
of why it's really frustrating to take things that Alex says at all seriously.

24:01.760 --> 24:07.680
So instead of making China a capitalist country at the end of World War II, criminal elements

24:07.680 --> 24:11.480
of the Rockefeller Combine, Dave Rockefeller wrote a book about this and wrote two articles

24:11.480 --> 24:15.420
in the New York Times, and I always go back to this because this is key, this is the real

24:15.420 --> 24:20.000
world, and sent George Herbert Walker Bush in there with James Baker and the rest of

24:20.000 --> 24:27.240
them to make a deal with the communist Chinese after they'd spent 25 years enslaving and

24:27.240 --> 24:31.740
killing 80 million other people and getting them to behave and after they'd follow every

24:31.740 --> 24:36.040
directive of one child policies and horrible things that the Rockefellers told them to

24:36.040 --> 24:37.040
do.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.900
They said, yeah, kill about 80 million of your people and one child policy and we'll

24:39.900 --> 24:46.040
make you the global superpower of economics, but you're not allowed to have a big military.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.720
But of course, wink, wink, they're globalists.

24:48.720 --> 24:51.240
They were building a big military the whole time.

24:51.240 --> 24:55.400
That's why you saw the pivot under Obama was because China wasn't following its agreement

24:55.400 --> 24:57.000
to not be expansionist.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.320
They were given all the rare earth minerals and all the economic power and they were allowed

25:00.320 --> 25:07.040
to economically expand, but America would economically close, but then would have military

25:07.040 --> 25:08.040
dominance still.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.200
That's how you divide power.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.840
That's the rollerball allegory.

25:10.840 --> 25:11.840
That's really how globalism works.

25:11.840 --> 25:15.280
The original movie with James con 1972 or whatever it is is dead on.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.280
Yeah, of course.

25:16.280 --> 25:22.280
It's always, it's always a fucking movie and that's why like it's so frustrating to listen

25:22.280 --> 25:23.280
to him.

25:23.280 --> 25:26.020
Like it starts with, you know, that clip there, it starts with him saying something really

25:26.020 --> 25:30.280
absurd like that a decision was made by people like the Rockefellers to have China not be

25:30.280 --> 25:34.120
capitalist at the end of world war II and that kind of thing gets me kind of interested.

25:34.120 --> 25:37.440
Well, at least it would have earlier on doing this show.

25:37.440 --> 25:38.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:38.440 --> 25:41.320
You know, that's, that's a laughable and nonsensical claim.

25:41.320 --> 25:44.160
You know that even without doing any research, like what does it even mean?

25:44.160 --> 25:45.160
Yeah, yeah.

25:45.160 --> 25:48.560
I would ask Alex to explain what mechanisms were used by the Rockefellers to keep China

25:48.560 --> 25:50.480
from being a capitalist country.

25:50.480 --> 25:54.620
If I were to do this because of doing this show, I know that Alex would just point to

25:54.620 --> 25:58.440
John Birch society talking points about how the U S didn't do enough to help Shanghai

25:58.440 --> 26:03.240
Shek in the Chinese civil war, which is the claim that's then exaggerated into the Rockefellers

26:03.240 --> 26:04.400
installed Mao.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.400
Sure.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.160
Still, I like this absurd claim.

26:07.160 --> 26:10.840
It's stupid, but probably sounds smart to his audience and I can kind of appreciate

26:10.840 --> 26:11.840
that.

26:11.840 --> 26:15.880
That's kind of the kind of the sort of thing that I dig my, uh, my, my teeth into.

26:15.880 --> 26:16.960
Sure, sure, sure.

26:16.960 --> 26:20.520
He claims that David Rockefeller wrote a book and two articles in the times about this whole

26:20.520 --> 26:21.520
China stuff.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.600
And that's just not true.

26:22.600 --> 26:26.840
The op-eds Rockefeller wrote don't look great with the hindsight of history on our side,

26:26.840 --> 26:29.260
but they're nothing like Alex is claiming them to be.

26:29.260 --> 26:33.080
He also wrote a book called memoirs, which is an autobiography, but if that admission

26:33.080 --> 26:37.740
is in there, it'd be really simple for Alex to produce it, which weirdly he never does.

26:37.740 --> 26:41.600
Then everything falls apart with the rambling about the imaginary deal where China gets

26:41.600 --> 26:45.440
to have the economy and U S gets to have the military, which incidentally is something

26:45.440 --> 26:50.540
similar to like, uh, something Alex might be cribbing from a piece of dystopian sci-fi

26:50.540 --> 26:52.120
from the time when he was a child.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.120
Yep.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.120
Seems to be a pattern.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.120
Yeah.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.120
It does seem like that is often the case.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.120
Yeah.

26:57.120 --> 26:58.120
The original movie roller.

26:58.120 --> 26:59.440
What's your favorite X file, Dan?

26:59.440 --> 27:00.440
Logan.

27:00.440 --> 27:01.440
Yep.

27:01.440 --> 27:04.640
The original movie roller ball was based on a short story called roller ball murder by

27:04.640 --> 27:09.360
William Neil Harrison published in Esquire in September, 1973.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.520
It's a little bit different than what the movie ended up being.

27:11.520 --> 27:17.280
Uh, as it's far more a statement about the rising brutality and public's taste in entertainment.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.300
There are also similarities to the movie version though.

27:19.300 --> 27:24.640
Like it's a kind of clunky and not, not super great short story itself.

27:24.640 --> 27:31.380
There's a lot of mention of various women's shapeliness, but I mean, James con was great

27:31.380 --> 27:32.380
in the movie.

27:32.380 --> 27:33.380
Sure.

27:33.380 --> 27:34.380
Yeah.

27:34.380 --> 27:35.380
I read it.

27:35.380 --> 27:36.920
I read something that James Cod was talking about.

27:36.920 --> 27:41.360
Like, uh, he's like, man, love doing those roller ball scenes, but then I had to go at

27:41.360 --> 27:42.360
act.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.360
All right.

27:43.360 --> 27:47.760
Ah, that was about as a process for thief too.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.800
I think loved those roller ball scenes.

27:50.800 --> 27:51.980
In the short story.

27:51.980 --> 27:54.980
It's not so much like different countries do different things.

27:54.980 --> 27:59.040
It's that within the United States, different corporations run six different concerns of

27:59.040 --> 28:03.640
life, energy, transport, food, housing, services, and luxury.

28:03.640 --> 28:07.640
Each is a super powerful corporation and the main character, Jonathan E plays for the roller

28:07.640 --> 28:11.040
ball team run by energy company based in Houston.

28:11.040 --> 28:15.180
The actual story is about a guy who's the best roller ball player in the world, struggling

28:15.180 --> 28:19.880
with his sense of self, finding himself unsatisfied while living a life filled with money, power,

28:19.880 --> 28:21.360
sex, and celebrity.

28:21.360 --> 28:25.160
The brutality of the sport has been increasing with new rules being added to satisfy the

28:25.160 --> 28:27.160
public's lust for violence.

28:27.160 --> 28:31.240
Gradually things get more violent with rules added to penalize players who aren't trying

28:31.240 --> 28:34.560
hard enough by having their helmets confiscated.

28:34.560 --> 28:37.920
This all culminates in the all-star game at the end of the season, where there's a new

28:37.920 --> 28:42.700
rule that's added where there's no time limit for the game, essentially making a gladiatorial

28:42.700 --> 28:45.920
contest where pretty much everyone is guaranteed to die.

28:45.920 --> 28:49.820
Jonathan wants something more out of his life, but he doesn't know what, but as the all-star

28:49.820 --> 28:54.800
game gets closer, his only request is that he'd be able to see his estranged wife again.

28:54.800 --> 28:58.680
She comes to him and they fuck for a few days and then they remember their shared love that

28:58.680 --> 28:59.680
they had.

28:59.680 --> 29:03.680
Jonathan had convinced himself that in the past she'd been taken from him by the evil

29:03.680 --> 29:06.360
corporation, but he realizes that wasn't the case.

29:06.360 --> 29:11.200
Quote, it would be nice, I think, once to imagine that she was taken away from me by

29:11.200 --> 29:15.280
some malevolent force in this awful age, but I know the truth of that.

29:15.280 --> 29:19.520
She went away simply because I wasn't enough back then, because those were the days when

29:19.520 --> 29:25.080
I yearned—before I yearned for anything, when I was beginning to live to play the game.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.120
But no matter.

29:26.120 --> 29:30.140
For a few days she sits on my bed and I touch her skin like a blind man.

29:30.140 --> 29:33.840
It's implied that they both realize they can't go back to their younger lives even if there

29:33.840 --> 29:38.520
is love between them, and Jonathan knows that he has to play the all-star game even if it

29:38.520 --> 29:40.520
means almost certain death.

29:40.520 --> 29:45.120
The story concludes, quote, before the game begins I stand with my team as a corporation

29:45.120 --> 29:46.560
him plays.

29:46.560 --> 29:51.740
I'm brute speed today, I tell myself, trying to rev myself up, yet a dream in my thoughts

29:51.740 --> 29:53.840
I'm a bit unconvinced.

29:53.840 --> 29:57.640
A chorus of voices joins the band now as the music swells.

29:57.640 --> 30:02.920
The game, the game, all glory to it, the music rings, and I can feel my lips move with the

30:02.920 --> 30:04.760
words singing.

30:04.760 --> 30:08.360
William Harrison fleshed out the story into a screenplay that no longer really resembles

30:08.360 --> 30:12.600
the point of this original work, there's some parts of it that are still carried over, and

30:12.600 --> 30:15.740
it actually directly contradicts it at certain points.

30:15.740 --> 30:19.400
The director of the movie has explained why they made the movie, telling the Guardian,

30:19.400 --> 30:24.200
quote, I thought that violence for the entertainment of the masses was an obscene idea.

30:24.200 --> 30:27.800
This is what I saw coming, and that's why I made the film.

30:27.800 --> 30:31.840
The original and the movie are both commentaries on the idea of brutality as entertainment,

30:31.840 --> 30:36.140
but in order to make the movie out of a ten page story, they needed to add a whole plot

30:36.140 --> 30:39.920
about the corporations fearing that Jonathan was becoming too much of an individual in

30:39.920 --> 30:41.920
the corporate world built on conformity.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.600
Sure, Logan's run just came out recently.

30:44.600 --> 30:48.320
The game and the people's reaction to it, as well as the violence depicted in the movie

30:48.320 --> 30:53.320
itself and the people's reaction to that, were the point of the movie rollerball.

30:53.320 --> 30:57.660
If it has any artistic merit, it's that attempt for a statement.

30:57.660 --> 31:02.900
The dystopian sci-fi future backdrop, they're absolutely unnotable, and they only really

31:02.900 --> 31:06.360
exist as a way of justifying why the game exists.

31:06.360 --> 31:07.660
Yeah, yeah.

31:07.660 --> 31:10.880
Alex doesn't know how to wrestle with or analyze works of art.

31:10.880 --> 31:15.480
He refuses to understand subtext or deeper meaning, so it honestly makes perfect sense

31:15.480 --> 31:19.680
that he'd think that all this dystopian fiction from his youth is secretly about the communist

31:19.680 --> 31:23.320
conspiracy that no one will admit is right in front of their face.

31:23.320 --> 31:24.720
Here's an example.

31:24.720 --> 31:29.600
There is a phenomenon you could point to, which is that a lot of movies, particularly

31:29.600 --> 31:34.000
dystopian action movies, seem to exist in a world ruled by rigid authoritarians who

31:34.000 --> 31:37.280
have molded society into a state of uniformity.

31:37.280 --> 31:41.720
You could point this out and provide a number of examples, and that's fair.

31:41.720 --> 31:45.780
Alex might see this phenomenon and argue that this is because the globalists are using predictive

31:45.780 --> 31:48.760
programming to tell the world about what they're going to do to them.

31:48.760 --> 31:52.740
There's a cosmic contract law clause that states that these evildoers can't carry out

31:52.740 --> 31:56.480
their evil deeds unless we all consent to them, so they put this stuff in movies to

31:56.480 --> 31:58.480
get us to accept it.

31:58.480 --> 32:03.800
That is the theory for why there's such a consistent feature like this in this genre.

32:03.800 --> 32:07.920
I would argue that it's because the setting of a rigid, uniform world is one where it's

32:07.920 --> 32:13.160
incredibly easy to differentiate a hero character from the rest of the world.

32:13.160 --> 32:17.520
Even an anti-hero or a flawed person can easily be cheered for when they're the only person

32:17.520 --> 32:21.960
who has any modicum of individuality in a sea full of facelessness.

32:21.960 --> 32:26.280
Putting your character and their story into that setting is kind of a genre-based shortcut

32:26.280 --> 32:30.440
for plots where the tension is about individualism versus conformity.

32:30.440 --> 32:34.400
Engaging with text and art with even just a baseline of critical ability allows you

32:34.400 --> 32:38.720
to see authorial intent and understand the more complicated things that are being said

32:38.720 --> 32:42.440
by artistic works, and it brings a richness to your life.

32:42.440 --> 32:46.320
It's a critically important exercise now more than ever, and honestly, it's one of the

32:46.320 --> 32:48.680
things that I find most fascinating about Alex.

32:48.680 --> 32:53.920
I do believe that most of the stuff he says is embellishment or lies or things he doesn't

32:53.920 --> 32:58.360
actually believe or kind of believes, that his inability to grasp the point of literature

32:58.360 --> 33:02.280
in movies is something so consistent in his career that I find it difficult to accept

33:02.280 --> 33:05.000
that it's not a genuine feature of his brain.

33:05.000 --> 33:10.280
So yeah, it's annoying to do this show because I end up thinking about Rollerball.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.000
Yeah, that'll happen.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.560
And thinking about like, huh, there was an attempted statement that they were making

33:15.560 --> 33:22.280
there and the corporations and shit in the movie and all that is really just to make

33:22.280 --> 33:26.480
it so you're watching this movie and you're like, oh yeah, that's why that exists.

33:26.480 --> 33:30.880
That's why that brutal game exists that would never exist in our world.

33:30.880 --> 33:37.520
The commentary is about people's taste for sport and entertainment becoming more and

33:37.520 --> 33:42.920
more violent and the logical extension of that is a game where everyone's killing each

33:42.920 --> 33:43.920
other.

33:43.920 --> 33:49.120
Everyone's like, ah, that itself could not exist in our reality.

33:49.120 --> 33:53.520
So the commentary couldn't be made by plugging it into the present day because there'd be

33:53.520 --> 33:57.280
too many things like, hey, why isn't everyone getting sued for this?

33:57.280 --> 33:58.920
This would never fly.

33:58.920 --> 34:04.000
So you plug it into this dystopian authoritarian world in the future and then you're like,

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
oh yeah, that makes sense.

34:05.000 --> 34:11.280
And it makes it so much easier to cheer on your hero, Jonathan M. Even if he's not a

34:11.280 --> 34:12.280
great person.

34:12.280 --> 34:17.720
I wonder what it would have been like if Alex, instead of being into hard sci-fi and watching

34:17.720 --> 34:22.480
Rollerball at that age, he would instead watch like, they shoot horses, don't they?

34:22.480 --> 34:27.560
Watching everybody in that fucking exploitative, destructive dance contest, realizing that

34:27.560 --> 34:31.840
the real dystopia is where we live now.

34:31.840 --> 34:36.360
I just, I, I, I just, I don't know.

34:36.360 --> 34:39.400
I do wish that he was better at reading.

34:39.400 --> 34:40.560
Yeah, that would be nice.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.160
I wish a lot of people were better.

34:42.160 --> 34:45.240
I wish almost everyone was better at reading.

34:45.240 --> 34:47.360
It's a, it's a difficult skill.

34:47.360 --> 34:51.560
It is, it seems like it should be easy considering we talk to each other, but then you think

34:51.560 --> 34:55.040
about it and you realize most people don't even talk to each other, honestly.

34:55.040 --> 34:58.600
It's really hard to understand what people are saying because their brains don't speak

34:58.600 --> 35:00.200
the words that their brains think.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.200
Yeah.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.200
It's very strange.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.200
One of the more interesting things that...

35:03.200 --> 35:04.200
I feel like an alien right now.

35:04.200 --> 35:07.040
These human beings, they act so strange.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.040
So weird.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.040
Yeah.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.840
One of the more interesting things I found while I was looking at, I was reading about

35:11.840 --> 35:19.320
Rollerball was that the writer, William Harrison, he was like, I want more violence in this

35:19.320 --> 35:20.320
movie.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.320
Of course.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.560
He was like, he wants the movie to be super violent.

35:23.560 --> 35:27.880
He wants to make the point that the violence is supposed to be repulsive.

35:27.880 --> 35:30.360
So brutal that when you watch it, you go, no.

35:30.360 --> 35:31.800
You're disgusted by it.

35:31.800 --> 35:35.040
And then when people watched Rollerball, they were like, man, Rollerball is cool.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.040
Yeah.

35:36.040 --> 35:39.640
And then the director of it was talking about how like most of the, most of the European

35:39.640 --> 35:47.360
audiences that we've talked to understand that it's supposed to be that this is disgusting.

35:47.360 --> 35:51.400
And most American audiences are like, we should start a Rollerball league.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.580
Frankly, what's CTE?

35:53.580 --> 35:55.720
What's the difference between CTE and Rollerball?

35:55.720 --> 35:58.320
We might as well get Rollerball while we're at it.

35:58.320 --> 36:02.320
Anyways, Vince McMahon, get the XFL the fuck out of here.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.840
Get the RFL right in here, man.

36:04.840 --> 36:05.880
That's what I'm talking about.

36:05.880 --> 36:14.780
So anyway, that sort of off sidetrack about the Rollerball off to the way, we get more

36:14.780 --> 36:16.640
complaints about China.

36:16.640 --> 36:20.480
That we live under this and it's all been one-sided.

36:20.480 --> 36:23.760
It's not about Kumbaya and one world living together and all this great stuff.

36:23.760 --> 36:28.360
Communist China was allowed to buy up our debt, buy up Hollywood, buy up our whole infrastructure.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.800
So I've been thinking about this for a while, and I think that this is one of the newer

36:31.800 --> 36:36.800
formulations of like the Jews run all the banks, you know, that kind of bigoted conspiracy

36:36.800 --> 36:37.880
theory.

36:37.880 --> 36:43.240
I think that the Chinese own all our debt is a sort of a new one of those.

36:43.240 --> 36:47.200
It's one that a lot of people, if they don't do any research, kind of passively accept

36:47.200 --> 36:49.720
because it sounds like something they've heard someone say before.

36:49.720 --> 36:50.720
Sure, sure, sure.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.400
And it's like, oh yeah, why wouldn't they?

36:52.400 --> 36:57.320
They bought up all our debt is such an intimidating thing where you're like, why would you buy

36:57.320 --> 36:58.320
debt?

36:58.320 --> 36:59.320
I'll believe you.

36:59.320 --> 37:00.320
Yeah.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.320
But it's just complete bullshit.

37:01.320 --> 37:06.040
According to Market Watch, the US government itself owns 27% of the US debt, with US investors

37:06.040 --> 37:08.880
owning a further 32.5%.

37:08.880 --> 37:13.960
The Federal Reserve owns 11.2%, which is just a slightly more complicated form of the government

37:13.960 --> 37:14.960
owning it.

37:14.960 --> 37:21.320
So all that added up is 70.9% of the US national debt that's owned essentially by US interests.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.320
Sure.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.440
Compared to that, the amount owned by China is not that much.

37:25.440 --> 37:31.340
As of 2018, they held about 5.6% of our national debt in the form of like treasury bonds.

37:31.340 --> 37:32.840
But Japan also had 4.9%.

37:32.840 --> 37:36.560
And I don't hear Alex yelling about the dreaded Japanese threat.

37:36.560 --> 37:38.840
Oh, well, they make our Sony stuff.

37:38.840 --> 37:43.160
These countries have bought these bonds because generally speaking, they're considered good

37:43.160 --> 37:46.800
investments, since most world currency is tied to the dollar.

37:46.800 --> 37:51.240
Also in 2020, Japan overtook China as the largest foreign investor in our debt.

37:51.240 --> 37:54.240
So the dynamic that Alex is describing is even more wrong.

37:54.240 --> 37:59.580
Ah, but what you're getting wrong there is China owns 99% of Japan's debt.

37:59.580 --> 38:03.720
So they secretly own all of the other 4.4%.

38:03.720 --> 38:04.720
Yeah.

38:04.720 --> 38:05.720
Yeah.

38:05.720 --> 38:09.400
So people, they want to spread this fear, and what it's based on is the idea that China

38:09.400 --> 38:10.400
owns our debt.

38:10.400 --> 38:14.760
And what they can do is they can call in that debt, like you repay your debt whenever they

38:14.760 --> 38:15.760
want.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.280
Like a landlord who's giving you a slide.

38:17.280 --> 38:18.280
Exactly.

38:18.280 --> 38:22.840
And this is just another anti-communist conspiracy talking point that's based on more or less

38:22.840 --> 38:23.840
nothing.

38:23.840 --> 38:27.560
Alex wants to create that image because it means that China rules us.

38:27.560 --> 38:31.160
They can say the word and destroy our economy at any second.

38:31.160 --> 38:37.220
They don't own enough of our debt to really matter that much in that term, and also investing

38:37.220 --> 38:39.560
in our debt doesn't work like that.

38:39.560 --> 38:43.800
Our national debt is a super complicated thing, and it isn't the same as your personal debt

38:43.800 --> 38:46.640
that you might have if you're like laid on a gas bill.

38:46.640 --> 38:50.640
There are too many real world factors to make it sensible to discuss as like a one factor

38:50.640 --> 38:54.380
thing, like bigger number debt equals worse, or whatever.

38:54.380 --> 38:58.680
But that's basically what Alex is doing, and then adding on a layer of conspiracy China-baiting

38:58.680 --> 38:59.960
for fun.

38:59.960 --> 39:03.680
China didn't buy up all our debt, they don't own Hollywood, and they didn't buy all our

39:03.680 --> 39:04.680
infrastructure.

39:04.680 --> 39:05.680
Yeah.

39:05.680 --> 39:08.960
These are all just talking points Alex repeats over and over again until his audience accepts

39:08.960 --> 39:13.840
them as being fact, when it's all just kind of warmed over birch or nonsense.

39:13.840 --> 39:21.440
Yeah, it's very interesting to me that like one of the ways that the conservative propagandists

39:21.440 --> 39:27.080
get normal people to believe they're bullshit is because they try and make it that micro

39:27.080 --> 39:29.640
level of like, you have debt.

39:29.640 --> 39:32.920
If someone calls in that debt, that'll fuck up your day.

39:32.920 --> 39:36.400
The same thing is true for the United States, but what they don't realize is that when you

39:36.400 --> 39:39.480
get to the United States, money's imaginary.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.420
If they called in our debt, what happens?

39:41.420 --> 39:46.240
We print more, and then inflation goes up, and their money's worth less.

39:46.240 --> 39:47.720
You know, like it's stupid.

39:47.720 --> 39:54.720
There is a serious incentive for them not to do this based on their own economy.

39:54.720 --> 39:57.160
Yeah, it's all imaginary.

39:57.160 --> 40:00.640
You can print more money, and that's fine.

40:00.640 --> 40:04.240
You're just, inflation goes up, and all other kinds of bullshit happens.

40:04.240 --> 40:09.480
There's a hundred different after effects of that that, you know, there's, yeah.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.480
It's all magic.

40:10.480 --> 40:11.480
It's all magic.

40:11.480 --> 40:15.240
But even that being understood, what Alex is saying is just dumb.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.240
Totally.

40:16.240 --> 40:19.120
But it sounds compelling in the same way that, you know.

40:19.120 --> 40:22.760
You have debt, and if somebody calls it in, it'll fuck your day up.

40:22.760 --> 40:24.960
It's very simple to like get across.

40:24.960 --> 40:26.920
So I want to ask you a question here, Jordan.

40:26.920 --> 40:31.080
I think that you've done, you know, we've been at this for a while.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.680
You understand Alex pretty well.

40:33.680 --> 40:37.440
In this next clip, Alex discusses what his greatest sadness is.

40:37.440 --> 40:40.520
Do you think that you could guess what his greatest sadness is?

40:40.520 --> 40:45.800
The just unending swath of dead dogs in his wake.

40:45.800 --> 40:48.480
I would assume that that guilt would weigh heavily upon him.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.440
I don't know if he feels that bad about it.

40:50.440 --> 40:51.440
Just an astonishing number.

40:51.440 --> 40:54.160
Most of the time when he talks about it, it seems like those dogs had it coming.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.160
It's almost wistful, yeah.

40:55.160 --> 40:56.160
According to him.

40:56.160 --> 40:57.160
Yeah.

40:57.160 --> 40:58.160
No, you're incorrect.

40:58.160 --> 40:59.160
OK.

40:59.160 --> 41:00.880
Here's my greatest sadness.

41:00.880 --> 41:06.440
The average person that's a leftist buys into the system, they go and they get one degree

41:06.440 --> 41:07.440
and they can't get a job.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.440
They get two degrees.

41:08.440 --> 41:09.440
They can't get a job.

41:09.440 --> 41:10.440
They get three degrees.

41:10.440 --> 41:11.440
They can't get a job.

41:11.440 --> 41:15.040
Or they get some little government or bureaucracy job and they tell them, once we overthrow

41:15.040 --> 41:21.120
America and create a socialist utopia, you're all going to be in charge and have mansions.

41:21.120 --> 41:25.760
And they believe this.

41:25.760 --> 41:30.840
They're never going to be brought into the power structure.

41:30.840 --> 41:34.760
They're absolute jokes and they're vicious and they're hateful.

41:34.760 --> 41:41.440
So Alex's greatest sadness is over-educated liberals and leftists who can't find jobs.

41:41.440 --> 41:42.440
Yeah.

41:42.440 --> 41:48.320
So the socialist utopia is a capitalist utopia where we switch who lives in mansions.

41:48.320 --> 41:49.760
Is that what he thinks is going on?

41:49.760 --> 41:50.760
Yeah, probably.

41:50.760 --> 41:51.880
He would assume so, right?

41:51.880 --> 41:54.720
He doesn't understand socialism at all.

41:54.720 --> 42:00.960
In this next clip, Alex has recognized that there are, you know, some people showing up,

42:00.960 --> 42:05.440
maybe it's state capitals and being like, false flaggers.

42:05.440 --> 42:06.440
Yeah.

42:06.440 --> 42:09.400
No, I mean, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're the real deal.

42:09.400 --> 42:10.400
Patriots.

42:10.400 --> 42:11.800
Oh, I wouldn't admit that right now.

42:11.800 --> 42:12.800
They're good Patriots.

42:12.800 --> 42:15.680
Just going down there to say, Hey, what's going on?

42:15.680 --> 42:19.360
I wouldn't admit that preemptively votes, you know, and stuff.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.360
Sure.

42:20.360 --> 42:23.360
And because of this, there's also a lot of people who are showing up at the white house

42:23.360 --> 42:29.400
and Alex thinks that, you know, there's a few people now, but soon there'll be millions.

42:29.400 --> 42:36.160
It's so obvious by the weekend, they'll announce by the winter, they're going to pick a Saturday.

42:36.160 --> 42:38.500
So people aren't at work.

42:38.500 --> 42:43.260
And so they can all use social media to say, let's put a million people around the white

42:43.260 --> 42:44.260
house.

42:44.260 --> 42:45.260
It won't be a million today.

42:45.260 --> 42:51.840
It'll be a hundred thousand today today.

42:51.840 --> 42:56.440
Won't be a million today, it'll be a hundred thousand.

42:56.440 --> 43:01.720
But by the time Trump isn't leaving in a week or two, there'll be a million, 2 million,

43:01.720 --> 43:05.440
and they will tear those barricades up and storm the white house.

43:05.440 --> 43:06.440
That's been the plan.

43:06.440 --> 43:11.100
The Democrats said that's their plan and Hey, the globalists have never gotten in trouble

43:11.100 --> 43:13.240
for anything they've done.

43:13.240 --> 43:15.920
So why wouldn't they do that?

43:15.920 --> 43:17.440
Because they're never held accountable.

43:17.440 --> 43:23.120
I mean, if Trump like directly is like, I don't respect the results of an election,

43:23.120 --> 43:25.320
you know, and it's like, I'm not leaving.

43:25.320 --> 43:27.840
I wouldn't be surprised if tons of people show up.

43:27.840 --> 43:28.840
I don't know.

43:28.840 --> 43:32.100
I don't know how to quantify numbers, but I w I mean, a million people showing up outside

43:32.100 --> 43:35.560
the white house doesn't seem impossible to me.

43:35.560 --> 43:41.040
I think that's a pretty, you know, that, that might happen if a leader refuses to step down.

43:41.040 --> 43:42.040
I could see it.

43:42.040 --> 43:46.000
At a certain point, I think we can, we could go real high.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.360
We could go real high then.

43:48.360 --> 43:49.360
Not good.

43:49.360 --> 43:50.360
Not good.

43:50.360 --> 43:51.360
Definitely not good.

43:51.360 --> 43:57.980
There were tense standoffs outside the white house a couple months ago over the George

43:57.980 --> 44:00.920
Floyd protests and what have you.

44:00.920 --> 44:07.320
I don't, I don't know if people would storm the white house, but people would be shaking

44:07.320 --> 44:08.320
fences.

44:08.320 --> 44:09.880
You think we're going to get a moat around the white house soon?

44:09.880 --> 44:10.880
I don't know.

44:10.880 --> 44:11.880
You want to go with a moat?

44:11.880 --> 44:13.000
I don't, I don't know.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
I don't know.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
I don't know.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
You don't know.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.800
I think, I think a moat's coming and I think it's, I'm fine with that.

44:18.800 --> 44:19.800
Let them have the house.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.720
Let them have the house.

44:21.720 --> 44:24.120
Let them live there.

44:24.120 --> 44:25.120
Lock them in there.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.120
Give them a moat.

44:26.120 --> 44:27.120
Put alligators on there.

44:27.120 --> 44:31.560
I was just thinking about if they do a moat, I have the solution.

44:31.560 --> 44:32.560
Tons of jello.

44:32.560 --> 44:35.760
A bunch of jello powder in there.

44:35.760 --> 44:36.760
Oh man.

44:36.760 --> 44:37.760
Make a jello moat.

44:37.760 --> 44:38.760
That's true.

44:38.760 --> 44:39.760
That is true.

44:39.760 --> 44:43.480
The moat system may be outdated in terms of defensive effectiveness.

44:43.480 --> 44:45.960
Yeah, back in medieval times, they didn't have jello.

44:45.960 --> 44:49.720
You didn't have jello.

44:49.720 --> 44:56.260
So anyway, there's a situation here where Alex is, I just really can't stand this waffly

44:56.260 --> 44:59.560
back and forth nonsense of the fucking devil's coming.

44:59.560 --> 45:01.560
Oh, hey, let's learn lessons for next time.

45:01.560 --> 45:02.560
Hey, come on.

45:02.560 --> 45:08.000
Or this, apparently, you know, hey, maybe, maybe, maybe everything will be all right.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.240
I'm going to air some clips and then I'm gonna get refocused and come back, go through the

45:12.240 --> 45:16.520
election fraud, go through other key points of who's behind the machines, how there is

45:16.520 --> 45:21.540
a very narrow way out of this.

45:21.540 --> 45:23.500
A very narrow way out of this.

45:23.500 --> 45:29.260
And then I'm going to explain that there is another path.

45:29.260 --> 45:34.960
And that path actually is more destructive and very horrible, but will actually hasten

45:34.960 --> 45:39.120
the destruction of the global order and the destruction of the new world order.

45:39.120 --> 45:40.560
And they have stepped into it.

45:40.560 --> 45:45.160
Now, I have no desire to go down this path, but I will go down it if they take us there.

45:45.160 --> 45:49.440
And don't worry, you're going to go down that path, too, because there's no getting out

45:49.440 --> 45:51.700
of this now.

45:51.700 --> 45:54.880
Everyone is going to see world government manifest, you're going to see everything I've

45:54.880 --> 45:58.400
told you come true, everything, everything.

45:58.400 --> 46:00.520
So that's violence.

46:00.520 --> 46:01.880
That's street violence.

46:01.880 --> 46:05.400
That's murder of your neighbors and war and stuff.

46:05.400 --> 46:06.840
That's the other path.

46:06.840 --> 46:11.020
But there's a narrow path, which is Trump seizing power, basically.

46:11.020 --> 46:15.760
You can kind of get the sense that, like, okay, now the conversation has become, Trump

46:15.760 --> 46:23.540
has got to become king or else, like, we're all fucking shooting.

46:23.540 --> 46:27.280
And that's not encouraging, I would say.

46:27.280 --> 46:32.800
For sort of a baseline, so you're like, yeah, this is just where we're at, I don't know

46:32.800 --> 46:33.800
if I enjoyed that.

46:33.800 --> 46:40.920
No, I mean, right now I enjoyed the election results coming in and Biden winning outright.

46:40.920 --> 46:42.280
That's good stuff.

46:42.280 --> 46:49.740
But the amount of overconfidence and gloating that's going on before Trump has entirely

46:49.740 --> 46:52.560
left the White House is a little nerve wracking for me.

46:52.560 --> 46:58.240
I don't like it when people who I've seen gloat before and have all of our lives destroyed

46:58.240 --> 47:00.160
because of it gloat again.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.160
I don't like it.

47:01.160 --> 47:02.560
I don't like seeing it.

47:02.560 --> 47:09.120
Yeah, and I think because it's kind of untested territory, we really don't know how much of

47:09.120 --> 47:14.040
the stuff that goes on between an election and an inauguration is norms.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:15.680 --> 47:18.400
It's going to, we're going to turn out to find, it's going to be a lot, it's going to

47:18.400 --> 47:19.400
be a lot of norms.

47:19.400 --> 47:20.400
It very well may be.

47:20.400 --> 47:24.780
It's going to be a lot of norms that are no longer on the, on Cheers.

47:24.780 --> 47:30.840
So in this next clip, Alex has very few friends left in the media, or I mean, not friends,

47:30.840 --> 47:32.760
just people who even just doesn't hate now.

47:32.760 --> 47:33.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:33.760 --> 47:35.320
One of them, Lou Dobbs.

47:35.320 --> 47:36.320
Sure.

47:36.320 --> 47:37.320
He likes Lou Dobbs.

47:37.320 --> 47:38.320
All right.

47:38.320 --> 47:41.920
First I want to play a very important clip.

47:41.920 --> 47:46.240
Sidney Powell with Lou Dobbs discusses hammer and scope card.

47:46.240 --> 47:47.240
And this is very, very important.

47:47.240 --> 47:48.240
It's a good place to start.

47:48.240 --> 47:51.240
So we're going to play this clip and we'll be right back.

47:51.240 --> 47:54.720
So the long and short of this is that there's a conspiracy going around that there's a super

47:54.720 --> 48:00.520
secret overpowered computer called hammer that can run a program called scorecard, which

48:00.520 --> 48:03.900
was used to manipulate and change the results of this election.

48:03.900 --> 48:08.160
This desperate and absurd conspiracy is being sold by people like guests on Steve Bannon's

48:08.160 --> 48:11.920
show, Mike Flynn's attorney, Sidney Powell, and Lou Dobbs.

48:11.920 --> 48:14.280
These are high profile people in right-wing spheres.

48:14.280 --> 48:17.520
This just isn't like some fringe, completely online nonsense.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.600
So I was wondering, where did this come from?

48:19.600 --> 48:22.400
Luckily, I did not have to look too far.

48:22.400 --> 48:25.840
Will Sommer over at the Daily Beast had already put together a great piece about how all the

48:25.840 --> 48:29.920
claims about this supercomputer and the program come from a single source.

48:29.920 --> 48:32.620
It's someone who I have a special bond with.

48:32.620 --> 48:34.600
This all comes from Dennis Montgomery.

48:34.600 --> 48:35.600
God damn it.

48:35.600 --> 48:36.600
Yup.

48:36.600 --> 48:38.080
God fucking damn it.

48:38.080 --> 48:39.080
I was amazed.

48:39.080 --> 48:43.240
How has Dennis Montgomery found a way to claw back into reality?

48:43.240 --> 48:45.480
I was amazed to see his name come up again.

48:45.480 --> 48:46.480
Motherfucker.

48:46.480 --> 48:51.240
It would take far too long to get into this right now, but back in March 2017, on the

48:51.240 --> 48:55.880
25th episode of our podcast, we dedicated two and a half hours to Dennis Montgomery

48:55.880 --> 48:57.340
and his various frauds.

48:57.340 --> 49:00.520
So if anyone's interested in why you don't need to take anything that traces back to

49:00.520 --> 49:02.760
him seriously, go ahead and check that episode out.

49:02.760 --> 49:03.760
My god.

49:03.760 --> 49:05.840
Also, Will's article on it is a really good breakdown too.

49:05.840 --> 49:06.840
I believe it.

49:06.840 --> 49:08.840
This is how these dicks work.

49:08.840 --> 49:12.820
Supposedly respectable outlets on the right are so desperate for a big overarching explanation

49:12.820 --> 49:16.380
for how they were screwed in the election that they're willing to amplify and give credibility

49:16.380 --> 49:21.240
to claims being made by a career con man whose lawyer is Larry fucking Clayman.

49:21.240 --> 49:24.480
You can't do it.

49:24.480 --> 49:29.360
How is it that even in this world, people don't just like, Oh, it's Larry Clayman.

49:29.360 --> 49:31.360
Get the fuck out of here.

49:31.360 --> 49:35.800
Like Larry Clayman, Larry Clayman's coming for you eventually.

49:35.800 --> 49:37.960
Like it doesn't matter what if you're on the hard right.

49:37.960 --> 49:38.960
It doesn't matter.

49:38.960 --> 49:41.520
Sooner or later, Larry Clayman, Larry Clayman is going to sue you.

49:41.520 --> 49:42.520
Hey, sued Alex.

49:42.520 --> 49:43.520
He sued everyone.

49:43.520 --> 49:44.520
Roger Stone.

49:44.520 --> 49:45.520
Don't listen to him now.

49:45.520 --> 49:48.960
No, you don't even need to worry about the lawsuits.

49:48.960 --> 49:51.040
Just look at him and look at the things he's done.

49:51.040 --> 49:54.640
Look at the, the, the, the track record and be like, yeah, pass.

49:54.640 --> 49:55.640
Yeah.

49:55.640 --> 49:56.640
Yeah.

49:56.640 --> 49:57.640
Yeah.

49:57.640 --> 49:58.640
Don't care.

49:58.640 --> 50:01.120
You could have the biggest scoop in the world and I'm going to take the hit if you're right

50:01.120 --> 50:02.120
this time.

50:02.120 --> 50:03.120
Totally.

50:03.120 --> 50:06.560
I'm going to just bite the bullet and say, I don't trust anything you say.

50:06.560 --> 50:09.400
And if that bites me in the ass, I still did the right thing.

50:09.400 --> 50:14.780
The idea that you might like see a James O'Keefe video pop up and just be like, well, maybe

50:14.780 --> 50:16.080
he got it right this time.

50:16.080 --> 50:17.680
No, no, no.

50:17.680 --> 50:18.680
That's bad.

50:18.680 --> 50:19.680
That's bad thinking.

50:19.680 --> 50:20.680
Yep.

50:20.680 --> 50:24.200
So this next clip, Alex, like I said, he's, he's, he's kind of interested in these ideas

50:24.200 --> 50:29.280
about millions of people showing up at the white house, but also he doesn't like that

50:29.280 --> 50:34.080
the media is downplaying the number of people that are coming to Owen Schroyer's rally in

50:34.080 --> 50:35.080
Austin.

50:35.080 --> 50:40.960
He's very preoccupied and spends a lot of time talking about crowd sizes in Austin.

50:40.960 --> 50:43.080
Oh, and get out of studio for a while.

50:43.080 --> 50:47.720
Notice that there are thousands of people at rallies at all 50 capitals around the United

50:47.720 --> 50:48.720
States.

50:48.720 --> 50:53.720
I was down there just a few hours ago at the Texas Capitol DPS estimated there were about

50:53.720 --> 50:55.080
2000 people.

50:55.080 --> 51:05.520
Thousands more are showing up right in front of the South side of the Texas Capitol.

51:05.520 --> 51:07.600
And again, I sent some photos to you guys.

51:07.600 --> 51:11.800
It's actually on Savannah Hernandez's Twitter from a building above that actually shows

51:11.800 --> 51:12.800
the big giant crowd.

51:12.800 --> 51:23.560
I'll just pull it up on my phone, but the local news you will notice is not showing

51:23.560 --> 51:35.860
it because the local news does not want you to know what is unfolding and what is happening.

51:35.860 --> 51:38.640
And that's, that's how they operate.

51:38.640 --> 51:39.640
Yeah.

51:39.640 --> 51:40.640
In fact, let's not even show it.

51:40.640 --> 51:44.200
I want to show the above shots because I don't want to just look at my big fat ugly head

51:44.200 --> 51:46.680
up there and, you know, talk about how there's thousands of people.

51:46.680 --> 51:47.680
I'm going to, I want to show the overhead shot.

51:47.680 --> 51:48.680
I'm gonna go to rebroadcast.

51:48.680 --> 51:49.680
I'll find it.

51:49.680 --> 51:50.680
It's not the crew.

51:50.680 --> 51:51.680
I just have to have this.

51:51.680 --> 51:52.680
I just have to have it.

51:52.680 --> 51:53.680
Or I can't do the show.

51:53.680 --> 51:54.680
Okay.

51:54.680 --> 52:02.320
And then I'm going to read to you the breakdown from the president, a new statement that has

52:02.320 --> 52:06.880
come out and then I'm going to go through everything else that is here.

52:06.880 --> 52:14.840
But right now let's go ahead and play Ali Alexander at the Capitol.

52:14.840 --> 52:19.120
And then I want to show the project Veritas.

52:19.120 --> 52:20.120
There it is.

52:20.120 --> 52:21.120
Look at that.

52:21.120 --> 52:22.120
And I'm not throwing a fit.

52:22.120 --> 52:25.200
I just want people to see that I need you to see this picture.

52:25.200 --> 52:26.200
Oh my God.

52:26.200 --> 52:27.200
Yeah.

52:27.200 --> 52:28.200
I don't know.

52:28.200 --> 52:29.200
I don't know.

52:29.200 --> 52:30.200
I'm not throwing a fit.

52:30.200 --> 52:31.200
Yeah.

52:31.200 --> 52:32.200
I'm not throwing a fit.

52:32.200 --> 52:33.200
He doesn't actually go to rebroadcast though.

52:33.200 --> 52:36.820
I mean, whoever he is, whatever intern he's hired was able to pull that up before the

52:36.820 --> 52:37.820
pot bubbled over.

52:37.820 --> 52:39.160
Before it got too bad.

52:39.160 --> 52:40.160
Yeah.

52:40.160 --> 52:41.160
All right.

52:41.160 --> 52:45.100
But he does spend a lot more time than this even on just like the crowd size pictures

52:45.100 --> 52:49.280
and it's like, boy, this is exactly the same as after the 2016 election.

52:49.280 --> 52:50.280
Sure is.

52:50.280 --> 52:55.600
This is just like a sort of fun house mirror version of, oh, we did the election.

52:55.600 --> 52:56.800
We talked about fraud.

52:56.800 --> 53:01.580
We talked about complaining about different claims about crowd sizes.

53:01.580 --> 53:04.120
It's just that this guy lost this time.

53:04.120 --> 53:05.640
It's almost exactly the same.

53:05.640 --> 53:06.640
Yep.

53:06.640 --> 53:08.720
Just beat for beat, just with a different angle.

53:08.720 --> 53:12.920
I just, I just can't believe that they're going to accept this.

53:12.920 --> 53:18.520
Like it's not going to, every other year during an election season, Alex is going to scream

53:18.520 --> 53:20.600
about how it's the devil.

53:20.600 --> 53:25.720
And then every other year he's going to be like, well, I know we lost, but we got a path

53:25.720 --> 53:28.420
through this and it's never going to stop.

53:28.420 --> 53:32.220
They will always be convinced that it's the devil and they will always be convinced that

53:32.220 --> 53:34.480
it's fine that the devil won this time.

53:34.480 --> 53:36.240
Well, if it's so inferior.

53:36.240 --> 53:37.240
Yeah.

53:37.240 --> 53:41.520
If things can keep going, it does seem like that would be just how things will go.

53:41.520 --> 53:42.840
That's just how it operates.

53:42.840 --> 53:43.840
Yeah.

53:43.840 --> 53:47.800
And then just come up with fun, interesting stuff to say about whatever headlines he didn't

53:47.800 --> 53:50.280
read the articles of and keep going.

53:50.280 --> 53:54.600
How disappointing would, how disappointed do you think God is that they're like, we

53:54.600 --> 53:58.280
only fight against the devil in an election year.

53:58.280 --> 53:59.440
Come on, man.

53:59.440 --> 54:02.840
And we fight against the devil's assistant during the midterms.

54:02.840 --> 54:03.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

54:03.840 --> 54:05.840
The devil takes the midterms off.

54:05.840 --> 54:09.640
You got to delegate responsibility sooner or later.

54:09.640 --> 54:10.880
Otherwise you burn yourself out.

54:10.880 --> 54:15.300
And if you're the devil, you're at high risk of burning.

54:15.300 --> 54:22.680
So Alex is preoccupied with these crowd pictures and I could not find myself giving a shit.

54:22.680 --> 54:28.560
And I ended up turning off this episode, this Saturday episode, because it was so boring.

54:28.560 --> 54:34.920
It is so much just like over and over again, rambling, repetitious, the election was stolen,

54:34.920 --> 54:38.120
but it also was really uninspired.

54:38.120 --> 54:42.120
Like here's a little clip that just sort of sums up kind of how I feel it went.

54:42.120 --> 54:47.760
They just stole this bigger than Dallas right out in the open.

54:47.760 --> 54:49.080
You know, you think about stealing something.

54:49.080 --> 54:53.020
You're kind of like a cat burglar going in to get the jewels.

54:53.020 --> 54:58.320
There was no cat burglar in going on here, ladies and gentlemen.

54:58.320 --> 55:00.440
This was done out in the open.

55:00.440 --> 55:04.800
There's a feeling of resignation almost to the fact that like, ah, they stole it.

55:04.800 --> 55:05.800
We've proven it.

55:05.800 --> 55:08.880
What are you going to do?

55:08.880 --> 55:10.280
And I don't understand that.

55:10.280 --> 55:11.600
No, no, no.

55:11.600 --> 55:16.760
I mean, I understand it if you don't actually believe any of it, then it makes perfect sense.

55:16.760 --> 55:19.780
I understand that, but that's a weird space to perform in.

55:19.780 --> 55:26.620
Especially if you've made your last entire year and a half, a referendum on whether or

55:26.620 --> 55:31.560
not the tree of Liberty does need to be watered with the blood of tyrants from time to time.

55:31.560 --> 55:34.420
And apparently, I guess not this year.

55:34.420 --> 55:37.640
It's been abundantly clear what his position on that is.

55:37.640 --> 55:40.120
You would think that you don't go back from that.

55:40.120 --> 55:41.120
Yeah.

55:41.120 --> 55:45.800
So we have this situation where we're, you know, in this period after the election where

55:45.800 --> 55:50.980
it's the 79 days of hell and Biden is the president elect and Alex, you know, Trump

55:50.980 --> 55:56.560
hasn't conceded and Alex doesn't know what he's, you know, I, I find it to be like one

55:56.560 --> 56:01.720
of the most important points for us to be like really tracking what are the moves, what

56:01.720 --> 56:03.300
are the things he does.

56:03.300 --> 56:07.500
And I found this Saturday to be just almost unlistenable.

56:07.500 --> 56:10.920
It's just banging the gong over and over again.

56:10.920 --> 56:11.920
Election was stolen.

56:11.920 --> 56:12.920
Treading water.

56:12.920 --> 56:15.040
But yeah, but treading water, boring.

56:15.040 --> 56:16.040
Yeah.

56:16.040 --> 56:17.040
Yeah.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.040
Yeah.

56:18.040 --> 56:22.300
Um, and so I needed to jump into Sunday and like get a sense of something and I really

56:22.300 --> 56:25.920
feel like Alex didn't do it for me at the beginning of the show.

56:25.920 --> 56:30.720
I can tell you as bad as it is, we're going to come through this stronger on the other

56:30.720 --> 56:32.480
side no matter what happens to Trump.

56:32.480 --> 56:33.480
We're not.

56:33.480 --> 56:36.800
The devil is killing us all.

56:36.800 --> 56:38.840
I'd wish that we could bypass what's coming.

56:38.840 --> 56:42.940
I wish we could have gone around this, which you could have had an easy landing and kept

56:42.940 --> 56:46.400
Trump and there's still 20% chance of doing that.

56:46.400 --> 56:50.200
There's about a hundred percent chance of doing that if Trump takes dramatic action.

56:50.200 --> 56:55.680
So there's a 20% chance of him winning, I guess, I guess the election and then a hundred

56:55.680 --> 56:59.400
percent chance of everything going cool if Trump sees his power, right?

56:59.400 --> 57:02.680
That would be a hundred percent chance.

57:02.680 --> 57:03.680
I don't know.

57:03.680 --> 57:06.040
2020, I'd give it a 50 50 shot.

57:06.040 --> 57:07.320
Well, no, no, no.

57:07.320 --> 57:12.040
Cause with the hundred percent chances of Alex getting what he wants and he was still

57:12.040 --> 57:15.840
wouldn't, but he would get the, what he wants in the form of Trump staying in power and

57:15.840 --> 57:22.000
Trump, not Biden, not being in office where Trump to unilaterally declare himself a dictator.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
That'd be great.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Yeah.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.200
I'd be stoked about that.

57:25.200 --> 57:29.200
So there's only 79 more days of hell.

57:29.200 --> 57:33.440
So when I do these shows, it requires a lot of thinking, a lot of preparation, a lot of,

57:33.440 --> 57:36.280
you know, sitting around and thinking like, what is he trying to say here?

57:36.280 --> 57:38.240
You know, there's a lot of that.

57:38.240 --> 57:43.720
And so I'm accustomed to stretches of, of intense mental exertion.

57:43.720 --> 57:44.720
Sure.

57:44.720 --> 57:46.720
Alex, he is too.

57:46.720 --> 57:53.840
I brainstormed so hard this morning from about 6 AM to about 12 noon when I got to the office

57:53.840 --> 58:02.880
that I got completely exhausted about an hour and a half ago and had to go take a nap.

58:02.880 --> 58:03.880
Okay.

58:03.880 --> 58:04.880
All right.

58:04.880 --> 58:05.880
Thinking is hard.

58:05.880 --> 58:06.880
That's fair.

58:06.880 --> 58:07.880
I love shit.

58:07.880 --> 58:11.200
I told everybody to kill everybody, but now I think that's a bad idea.

58:11.200 --> 58:12.960
So what's my next move?

58:12.960 --> 58:16.360
Power nap, power nap, seize power nap.

58:16.360 --> 58:17.360
All right.

58:17.360 --> 58:18.360
I know what to talk about today.

58:18.360 --> 58:21.960
You know, I think this is a new thread that I hope will go on throughout the podcast as

58:21.960 --> 58:29.760
Alex reverting to dream space for his, to find the answers.

58:29.760 --> 58:35.200
Alex becoming sort of like the shaman of the right wing extremist world.

58:35.200 --> 58:38.880
He's going to hire a Daniel who's going to interpret his dreams for him and then we've

58:38.880 --> 58:39.880
got this all covered.

58:39.880 --> 58:40.880
That's Rob Dew.

58:40.880 --> 58:41.880
That's why he's still around.

58:41.880 --> 58:42.880
That's Rob Dew.

58:42.880 --> 58:43.880
Yeah, absolutely.

58:43.880 --> 58:45.480
Owen's not going to do shit, but yeah.

58:45.480 --> 58:51.520
So Alex gives a little, tells a little story about his family's breakfast time this morning

58:51.520 --> 58:52.880
that I found kind of disturbing.

58:52.880 --> 58:53.880
All right.

58:53.880 --> 58:57.760
Well, this morning I talked to my oldest daughter and my wife at breakfast while my three year

58:57.760 --> 59:02.880
old daughter played in toy cars and blocks on the floor and I prepared them both for

59:02.880 --> 59:03.880
what was happening.

59:03.880 --> 59:09.960
And both my wife and my oldest daughter finished my sentences before I could even complete

59:09.960 --> 59:12.720
them and they looked at me and they said, we know you're right.

59:12.720 --> 59:14.720
We're ready and we understand.

59:14.720 --> 59:20.160
And it was a very good feeling, a feeling of strength because they weren't repeating

59:20.160 --> 59:22.200
things that have been drilled into their head.

59:22.200 --> 59:25.580
I'd never really put these things on them, but they'd been listening and they'd been

59:25.580 --> 59:26.580
checking the truth.

59:26.580 --> 59:31.760
My oldest daughter, Charlotte looked to me and she said, dad, you're almost always right.

59:31.760 --> 59:34.200
A little tear came out her eye.

59:34.200 --> 59:39.160
And that was meant so much to me when I gave him this speech at the breakfast table at

59:39.160 --> 59:43.400
8 AM this morning and I laid out the future.

59:43.400 --> 59:45.200
I told him we tried to stop what was coming.

59:45.200 --> 59:47.600
I told him what was coming next and they understood.

59:47.600 --> 59:53.640
You just imagine like sitting around with like some granola, Alex stands up and he's

59:53.640 --> 59:56.640
like, at this breakfast I must tell you the future.

59:56.640 --> 59:58.960
This is a dinner conversation for sure.

59:58.960 --> 59:59.960
Totally.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.120
This is a family meeting.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.680
These kids are too young for coffee.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:06.520
You can't handle Alex Jones predicting the future without a little caffeine in you.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.520
Right?

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.520
Yeah.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.520
That's not fair.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.520
You can let him get through the morning.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.560
I'm not going to deal with the apocalypse in the morning.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.680
Absolutely not.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:18.000
I don't know why, but that mental image to me is like in the real world, disturbing.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Oh, terrifying.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
In a movie, hilarious.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
It's so funny.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
So funny.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Man.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.400
And the worst part is, here's the worst part for me.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:31.160
The kids don't know something that's fundamentally true that would change everything about their

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.240
outlook on life.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.640
Their dad is Alex Jones?

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.360
No, they're going to be fine.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.360
They're going to continue to be rich.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.560
They're going to continue to be taken care of.

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:44.720
They're going to continue doing everything with no changes at all.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:45.720
Well.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.720
None.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:47.720
Yeah.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:51.520
I mean, I guess I would say they're going to be fine in many material ways.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.520
Well.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.520
They're not going to be fine emotionally.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.520
Without your dad.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.520
No, no, no.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.520
That's what I'm saying.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.520
That's what I'm saying.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.520
Yeah.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:03.680
If he just sat him down and been like, listen, I am always lying.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.120
We're going to be fine.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.120
Don't worry.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.120
Why are you crying?

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.120
There's no need to cry.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.120
We're rich as shit.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.120
We don't actually care.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.960
The tear in her eye and saying you're almost always right doesn't sound like something

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.080
that someone else says.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.080
That sounds like Alex writing dialogue for imaginary characters.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.480
It does seem like that.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:26.040
Anyway, I would be more upset with him telling this story about preparing his children and

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:32.600
his wife for the coming tribulation or whatever the fuck if he didn't have really good reason

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:38.120
to suspect that there is corruption in the election.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:42.640
And one of the pieces of evidence he brings to the table is, uh, I mean, fuck, I'm, I'm

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.640
convinced.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:50.480
You know, Google has a big article that's up on info wars.com, Google analytics.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:55.860
And they had a record search in the days before the election and the days after the election

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:59.680
that no one ever searches.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:05.000
What is the penalty was one of the searches and what is the consequences and what is the

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.440
prison time and what is the jail time?

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:12.740
These are searches no one's ever done that they ever, but now it was by the thousands

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:25.080
per state in Pennsylvania, in Georgia, in Minnesota, in Wisconsin, in Michigan.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.520
The search was for what is the consequences?

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:29.620
What is the penalty?

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:32.560
What is the prison time for election fraud?

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:33.560
Wow.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:39.320
Cause that's election officials in fraud, not voter fraud.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.720
Who do you think might be searching?

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.720
There it is.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:42.720
Scroll up.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.640
Google trends, searches for election fraud, punishment surge in the key battleground states.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:50.400
It's not just those mores come out.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.640
That is people checking to see what's going to happen to them.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.860
What a conclusion he's jumped to.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:58.720
That is a big jump.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:03.680
So you're saying that people are Googling the crime they're about to commit or have

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:04.680
committed.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.480
What kind of trouble am I in?

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.480
What?

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.480
Why?

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.480
Oh my God.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.480
Yeah.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.800
You don't think it might have something to do with maybe right wing people constantly

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:19.040
hoping retribution will come to their enemies and wishing that there's some sort of punishment

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.760
that they can discover that will be worse than death?

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.760
Silly friend.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:26.360
This is a forensic fingerprint that proves that election officials are trying to figure

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.760
out what they got to look forward to because they committed election fraud.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.760
Wow.

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:31.760
Wow.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:32.760
What a good thinker.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:33.760
That is really good thinking.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:34.760
Yeah.

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:35.760
I'm impressed by him constantly.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.960
If that's the result of his brainstorming, he does not need to work for six hours.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:39.960
You should take a nap though.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.320
You should take a longer nap.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:42.320
Yeah.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:46.680
Because you'd probably have the exact same analytical abilities.

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.680
Pretty better.

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.840
So Alex says something in this next clip that I found really interesting and it's a good

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:59.800
example of like how there's sort of a dark mirror version of real world things that are

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.200
oftentimes behind his rhetoric.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.280
When I come back from break, I'm going to explain what they're saying to the president

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:10.120
inside the white house right now and how they're trying to get him to concede.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.840
But let me just say this right now.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:21.960
If Trump concedes, they're going to blame him for the COVID-19 deaths.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.920
They're going to set up a truth and reconciliation commission and demonize all of his supporters

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.880
and they're going to make the lockdown and the shutdown of our economy 10 times worse.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.640
And now Biden's announced that.

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:35.000
So I find this kind of interesting.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.280
I don't know if I disagree too much with Alex's assessment of things that could happen if

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.640
Trump concedes and Biden becomes president.

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:46.400
I just think that he's portraying these things in an intentionally false light.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.120
First he says that they'll blame Trump for the COVID-19 deaths.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:52.880
And to the extent that anyone should be blamed, it probably should be the executive officer

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:57.280
of the country who was in a position to make decisions that he failed to make.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:01.720
Obviously no one would say that it's all Trump's fault, but the conversation about policy failures

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:06.040
and new information about what was known when and what was ignored would almost certainly

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.320
paint Trump in a terrible light.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:14.240
Especially if he's staked his entire reputation on being a perfect chief executive officer.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:18.880
Yeah, you could easily see someone like Alex experiencing a harsh, sober look at Trump's

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:22.640
virus response as the globalists blaming him for all the deaths.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:27.280
So that might actually be a fair assessment just through a twisted mirror.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:32.320
I mean, you don't get to take credit for the things that the, and then not take blame for

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.320
things.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.320
Well, apparently you do.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.320
Oh, okay.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.320
Nevermind.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.320
I forgot about that.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:41.720
And there will be truth and reconciliation committees to demonize Trump supporters.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:46.040
This is obviously Alex's way of spinning the inevitable necessity of trying to bring humans

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.900
in this country back to a place where we can even communicate with each other.

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:53.640
The fracturing of a shared reality is something that needs to be addressed, and any attempt

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:58.260
to do that is a threat to someone like Alex whose entire business relies on the perpetuation

01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:00.560
of that false reality.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:04.500
Attempts by people who aren't in his fantasy world to humbly reach out and reintegrate

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:09.000
people who got sucked into the Trump cult or Q-shit is obviously going to be painted

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.520
as communist indoctrination by Alex and truth and reconciliation committees.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:20.960
His business cannot afford for him to present it any other way, but the attempts at reaching

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:28.120
out and having like, okay, look, that shit was really bad, but we need to figure out

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:29.520
a way to move forward.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.780
That will be what this is if Trump concedes.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:36.280
The third thing he says is that there will be even harsher lockdowns.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:40.160
Now I'm not sure if that's actually the case or how Alex would define any of those terms,

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:44.420
but I do think that if Biden were to get into office, a more adult, reasonable approach

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:46.480
to a public health crisis would be enacted.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:50.980
It would be easy for Alex to paint that as this harsh crackdown.

01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:56.020
All of the things that he's describing, if Trump concedes, are things that are based

01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:59.320
on kernels of things that could be real.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:07.080
It's just preemptively painting them as these evil nefarious plans that the globalists have.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:11.680
That's how he gives himself the credibility of having like all these good predictions

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.240
of the hell that will come upon us.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:19.440
Sure, but it's not that hard in this case because we already have been told ad nauseum

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:25.520
what a reasonable response would be and we've already not seen it, so then taking a reasonable

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:30.480
response is already baked into their propaganda.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.400
The fact that we didn't take a reasonable response makes us super smart for killing

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:39.280
200,000 people, and if they do take a reasonable response, then it's because they're trying

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.880
to hurt our economy.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:46.180
It's just, yeah, they've already won that messaging.

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:53.360
On this Sunday, I felt a little bit still untethered, like there wasn't much going on.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.800
He's just kind of saying the election was stolen.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:56.800
Sure.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:57.800
Hooray.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:58.800
Sure.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:05.040
But then we heard this clip, and man, Owen Schroyer, he had Steve Pacanich on and they

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.320
sort of dropped the ball.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.980
He's about to make up for it in a big way.

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:14.220
Let's go ahead and lay it out right now.

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:20.800
Owen Schroyer started tomorrow, he's going to launch a caravan that's going to leave

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:24.960
at 5 p.m. from a location we're going to announce, and it's going to drive you to Houston and

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:32.480
then along the Gulf of Mexico border through Louisiana, Mississippi, into Florida, where

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:39.040
it will turn north into Georgia, and we'll go up through the Carolinas into Virginia,

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.760
where I will meet it in DC on Friday.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:43.760
I want to make a bet on this.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.760
And we're going to call for others to launch caravans around the nation.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:45.960
I want to bet on this.

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:48.460
I would like to bet on this a million dollars.

01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:53.680
In the Midwest, in the South, and in the East Coast, to DC, truckers are already announcing

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:58.000
big strikes they're going to have, take over to DC this next weekend.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.720
So don't worry, President Trump, the cavalry's coming.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.360
Now I'm fucking excited.

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:03.360
Wow.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.360
Yes.

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:05.360
Wow.

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.360
Now we are in business.

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.360
Countdown to quit.

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:12.680
The new segment on Knowledge Fight, countdown to the caravan quitting.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:16.400
Well, I mean, caravan is also an unfortunate term for them to use because the right wing

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.680
was all obsessed with the caravans coming from south of the border.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.680
Sure, sure, sure.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.680
Those are bad caravans.

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:22.680
Seems like a weird term.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.240
They should have chosen a different word.

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.240
Yeah.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.240
But-

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.240
Convoy is right there.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.240
You guys are southern dum-dums?

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.240
C.W.

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.240
McCall would let you use the song.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.520
Convoy is right there.

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.520
Yeah.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.520
Hey there, rubber duck.

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.520
We got Owen Troyer.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:35.520
What are we doing?

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:37.520
We got Owen Troyer with some Smokies on his tail.

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.520
Caravan.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.520
Get the fuck out of here.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.840
Turn it into a convoy.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:41.840
Have a little excitement.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.720
We're the epic convoy coming up top Trump.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.520
And caravans are just plodding along from destination to destination.

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.520
Convoys?

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.520
They're escaping some shit.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.520
Or they're running moonshine.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.520
Or they're running.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.520
You're right.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:55.520
It should be-

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.520
It should be a convoy.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:57.520
Yeah.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:58.520
Yeah.

01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.520
And they could-

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.520
This is why the hard right sucks at everything.

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:01.520
They couldn't even get convoy right.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.520
It starts with the same letter.

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:06.760
And if Alex really wanted to put some money into this, he could hire Kellyanne Conway

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.280
to run the Kellyanne Conway convoy.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:12.480
Kellyanne Conway, yeah.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.480
It could work.

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.800
I like it.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.320
Alliteration should guide all choices.

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.320
Yes.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.240
So I got very, very, very, very, very, very excited about this.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.240
Yes, I am very excited.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.520
I am so pumped to see-

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.520
What a great punishment for Owen, too.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:28.520
Wow.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.080
What a brilliant way to punish Owen.

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.400
Well, actually, I think it's two-pronged.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.880
I don't know if it's necessarily a punishment, but it's like no one else could probably do

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.880
this.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:37.880
True.

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:41.520
And Owen really came into Infowars by yelling at people on the street.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.520
True.

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:47.440
And the only real value to the organization isn't as somebody who can tell whether Steve's

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:48.560
full of shit or not.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.560
Not good.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.560
He can't conduct interviews-

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.560
Nope.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:52.560
Credulously at all.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.560
Really bad at it.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:57.640
So why not just send him on a fucking tour convoy and have people yell at him-

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.640
That's what I'm saying.

01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.640
And yell at other people.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:01.800
It's play people to their strengths.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:02.800
Exactly.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.160
You did the pajonic shit.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.160
You fucked up.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.160
Totally.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.160
Now we're going to get back to basics.

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.160
Yeah.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.240
We're going to focus on what you do well, and then maybe you'll get your shot again.

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.240
Yeah.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.240
He got knocked down a peg.

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.240
Yeah.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.240
Yeah.

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.240
You wanted to play out of position.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.240
Yep.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.240
You blew it.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.240
You blew it.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.240
Now get back.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.240
Apprentice, go back to where you began.

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.240
Exactly.

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.240
Absolutely.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.240
So I'm excited.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.240
I'm so excited for that.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:30.000
The potential for hilarity is so high for this.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Is this documented?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.440
Somebody has to have a camera crew there, right?

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.440
No, no, no.

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.440
Of course.

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.440
Of course.

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.440
Owen Schroyer has his own show.

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.440
The One Room.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.440
I want the raw footage of this road trip.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.360
There's a channel on band.video right now for the caravan.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.360
Is it live streaming?

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.360
No, no.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.360
Oh, shit.

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.360
God damn it.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.360
I want the raw on this.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.760
We can edit something beautiful.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:58.440
I can't tell you, I've not been this excited for some dumb idea because he can't stop this.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.960
It's something that's supposed to happen over the course of this week.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:06.480
Owen Schroyer is already somewhere, undisclosed location at this point.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.480
This is happening.

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:10.720
I want to bet money on whether or not this makes it all...

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.320
I will bet you money right now.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.920
Alex does not make it to DC.

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.920
I'll take that bet.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:16.920
You'll take that bet?

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.920
Alex is flying.

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.920
He's already bought the tickets?

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.920
I'm sure.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:21.920
I think he's going to cancel it.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.920
I don't think he's going to make it.

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:23.920
What do you want to bet?

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:24.920
Let's bet 50 bucks.

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:25.920
Okay.

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:26.920
Charity.

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:27.920
Let's bet 10 bucks.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.920
50 bucks to a charity.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:29.920
50 bucks to charity.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.920
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:31.920
I'll take that bet.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.920
Sounds good.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:33.920
I'm going to win this bet.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:34.920
Alex is going to DC.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:35.920
Okay.

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:36.920
All right.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.520
I'm going to go dumb.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:44.400
I feel like the better bet is whether or not Owen makes it.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.600
Ooh, that's a good question.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.880
Because he's actually got a challenge in front of him of stopping at all of these cities.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:50.880
That's true.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.880
Alex is just going to fly.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.880
That's what I'm saying.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:57.000
See, but what I'm saying is if Owen doesn't make it, there's no way Alex can save face

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.680
on that, right?

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.040
It would be tough, but it would also be...

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:03.440
It's debatable whether or not the presentation would be better if Owen doesn't make it.

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.440
That's true.

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.440
That is true.

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.440
I know.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:07.440
I know.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.440
Oh, man.

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.440
They have to make up some story about him being stopped?

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.440
Oh, that's what I want.

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:11.440
That's what I want.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.440
You listen to me good and you listen to me well.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.440
Yeah.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.440
Okay.

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.440
All right.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.440
Now.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.440
Okay.

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:23.800
If there were any way for this to have been possible, I would almost do anything to be

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.620
on that bus.

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:27.480
Like to be a Hunter S. Thompson type.

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:28.480
Totally.

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.640
Like, hey, look, I don't like you guys, but I want to do some Gonzo journalism where I

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.200
come on this bus with Owen.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.520
I'll stay out of your way.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.200
I'm not going to fuck with anything.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.320
Just to be able to record this for history.

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.640
No, that's what I'm saying.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.920
If there's raw footage, this should be filmed all the time.

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:47.400
This should be a road trip documentary and we should have the final cut.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.480
This should be the new Cannonball Run.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.480
Totally.

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:51.480
Holy shit.

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:52.480
There it is.

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.480
Holy shit.

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.480
Writing it down.

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.480
Some...

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.480
Now.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.480
Jordan.

01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.480
Jordan.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.480
Jordan.

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:00.480
Cold open.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.480
I have to...

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.480
Fade in.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.480
I have to...

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.480
I have to punch this up.

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.480
Okay.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:06.480
I have to punch this up in there.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.480
Alright.

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.480
And he's got to get to DC through all these stops.

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.480
Sure.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.480
Sure.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.480
Sure.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.480
Sure.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.480
Also, Antifa is there.

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:14.480
Right.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:15.480
And they have to get to DC.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.480
So we're getting to wacky racist territory.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:17.480
Yes.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.480
I want John Cleese involved.

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.480
Of course.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.480
Absolutely.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.480
Rowan Atkinson can get involved.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.480
We have rat race going on.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:23.480
It's a rat race all over again.

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:24.480
Yeah.

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.480
Yes.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.480
We need to have an Antifa news organization.

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:29.760
And then there's, there's gotta be somebody who's dastardly and a dog that laughs.

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.840
These are the things I know about the wacky races.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:37.160
And, and one car that's like, they're drunk, but we're not going to show them drinking.

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.160
We're just going to let that go.

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.160
Because they're driving.

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:40.160
Yeah.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.160
Yeah.

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.160
Yeah.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.160
They're characters who are drunks.

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.160
You know what's going on.

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.160
Yeah.

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.160
We're not showing this for legal reasons.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:47.160
So anyway, you can tell I'm very excited about this.

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.160
I'm stoked about this.

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.160
Yeah.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.160
This is an exciting new development.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.160
Yeah.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.080
This is the first time I've been really excited about something Infowars done in a while.

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.080
Yeah.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:58.840
Although I do think that there is the potential for this to go really bad because I think

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:02.520
a lot of the people who might be drawn to that would be violent type.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.520
Sure.

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.480
And certainly we, I hope that that's not the case and that's not what I'm excited for.

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:11.520
I'm excited for Owen tripping over his own foot all the way up the Eastern seaboard.

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.520
Totally.

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.520
That's what I'm interested in.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.520
Totally.

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.520
Yeah.

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.920
Imagine if Paul Revere had like a two legged horse.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.920
That's what we're dealing with here, man.

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:20.920
Yep.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.480
So Alex gets to talking to Ali Alexander.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.320
He comes on and they're just trying to get Trump not to concede.

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.320
Sure.

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:34.120
And it's so critical Ali to not get the president to concede because the cavalry is coming and

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.400
the evidence of fraud is mounting massively Ali Alexander.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:42.920
We know that the president is watching these broadcasts and so I want to say Mr. President,

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.360
the Calvary is coming.

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.640
So you got Calvary and cavalry coming.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:48.640
Oh man.

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:49.640
It's exciting.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:50.640
Calvary.

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.360
You're the guys who like the Bible.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.360
Figure it out.

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.360
Maybe that's the problem though.

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.360
They like it.

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.360
They like it too much.

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.360
Yeah.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:03.080
So you've seen Ali Alexander really coming into his own as a real like hardline zealot.

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.080
Yeah.

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.720
Real, real religious Christian zealot.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.920
So maybe he is actually saying Calvary.

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:09.920
That could be.

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:10.920
That could be.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.240
The Calvary is coming for you.

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.680
We're going to put you up there.

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:19.960
So if the election is to be believed by the, you know, all the sources that are reality,

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:20.960
right.

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:21.960
Then Biden won.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:22.960
Yes.

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:23.960
And even if that's the case, Trump should still be president.

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:24.960
I think that's great.

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:28.760
Even if he'd won the election in which he hasn't, we have a right to not let him beat

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:32.120
the president because they claimed Trump was this Russian agent with no proof.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:37.260
With Joe Biden, my God, Ali Alexander, we've got incredible evidence.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.840
We've got damning evidence.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.840
We've got him dead to rights.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.640
So I mean like why even do the election then based on what you're saying?

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.640
Pretty much.

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:46.640
Yeah.

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.160
You're, you're saying that the person is disqualified.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:53.820
So like why wasn't your argument, I mean, why, why wasn't there like a position of fuck

01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:56.520
this election, we shouldn't even do it.

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.520
Sure.

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.760
Instead of let's do the election, the Democrats are going to try and steal it and Trump will

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.040
win by a landslide.

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.040
Yeah.

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.040
I don't understand.

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.640
I mean, they tried to sell that with the only way that it's a fair election is if Trump

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:08.640
wins.

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:09.640
So why do the election?

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:11.080
Because if he doesn't win, it's an unfair election.

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:14.800
But at the same time, the argument with that wasn't let's just not do the election.

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:15.800
Yeah.

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.400
Now, now it's like we shouldn't have done the election.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.400
We shouldn't even have done it.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.400
It doesn't matter if Biden wins.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.400
It turns out we could lose.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.040
I didn't expect that.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.040
Yeah.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:27.480
I think that's another thing that they're, they're not able to comprehend how stupid

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:28.480
it makes them look.

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.480
Right.

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.480
Okay.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:34.240
So you're saying that Trump had no, like it's all fake evidence and none of it's real.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.960
They had no evidence for the Russia thing.

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:36.960
Right.

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.400
But we saw a lot of it.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:39.400
Yeah.

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.480
And from varied sources all over the place.

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.480
Yeah.

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.480
Right.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.880
So if that's manufactured, that's well manufactured.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:46.880
Quite.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:51.240
Currently Trump is proving that Biden stole the election.

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:53.040
We have very little evidence.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:57.040
Well, we have Rudy Giuliani at a landscaping place.

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.040
Right.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.400
See, so they're even admitting that they're bad, they're worse at faking evidence than

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.400
the, than...

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.400
Shut the fuck up.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:05.400
Dennis Montgomery.

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:06.400
All right.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.400
And hold your horses.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.400
I'm sorry.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.400
Hold your horses.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.400
Google, Google data.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.400
Alex showed the Google data.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.400
That's true.

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.400
That's true.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.400
Come on.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.400
That's true.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:16.400
Get it together.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:20.640
I would, I would think that they could at least get one person like a, like a Michael

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:24.120
Flynn or a Michael Cohen to like flip for him just for a little...

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:27.880
Michael Flynn's lawyers pumping out the Dennis Montgomery stuff.

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:28.880
Yeah.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.560
But from the other side, you know, they gotta get a, they gotta entrap someone and have

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:35.680
them like turn rogue or whatever.

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:41.120
So I think what they really want though, and I think that's something that we've been kind

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.120
of aware of.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.120
Sure.

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.160
Is for Trump to seize power and is to be a Christian theocracy.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.160
Yes.

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:48.840
And Ali is a little bit too open about that.

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:53.400
They're perverts and they're seeking to, you and I have talked about this, invert, invert

01:18:53.400 --> 01:19:00.120
all of these holy orders that we have, that Christianity stabilized this, this feral version

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:06.560
of, of what Rome had, you know, after it burned and all this, Christianity injected into Western

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.480
civilization, a stabilizing formula.

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:12.560
And then Western civilization didn't work until we had it.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.560
Exactly.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:18.720
So the basis of what we call Western civilization now is Christianity because prior Western

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.040
civilization didn't work.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:24.280
Oh, so whenever you talk about like Western civilization being what you're all about,

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:29.600
you're actually just talking about like a, I don't know, a Christian religious state,

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.600
a theocracy.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.600
Oh, okay.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.600
Cool.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.040
Just, I'm glad, I'm glad that we can have that in the clear now.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.720
It is, it is kind of, see, it is kind of obvious now.

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.040
I mean, in the clear again.

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.040
Yeah.

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:44.280
I mean, that's really their only option if they, if they can't even really lie about

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:51.800
the election results, cause nobody's buying it, except for everybody that they like, then

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:56.320
your only option is then just to out and out be like, well, in order to save the Republic,

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.200
we have to become a Christian theocracy.

01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.200
Yeah.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:06.240
I think that that's sort of the, the underlying trend that you see from people like Ali, obviously,

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:11.320
and a little bit on Info Wars, but actually the sense that I got from this Sunday episode

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:17.360
was very much not that interested in the election fraud stuff anymore.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.440
Like he kind of, it's just like, ah, we proved it.

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:25.440
And he has stuff like this that happened, but his focus seems to be elsewhere.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:29.680
Here's Biden two months ago saying, we've got the most people ever for election fraud.

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:33.120
And then Pelosi, a week and a half ago saying, I don't care what happens with this thing

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:38.720
coming up, he'll be inaugurated after, and they told us they do it with the ballots and

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:42.600
they did it because if there's one thing criminals do, they love to brag.

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:45.400
Only time they tell the truth is when they're telling you how they're effing you over here

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.400
it is.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:53.480
Secondly, we're in a situation where we have put together and you guys did, did it for

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:59.180
our administration, the president Obama's administration before this, we have put together,

01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:09.640
I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:10.640
politics.

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:14.240
But we are ready.

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:20.080
I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected president on Tuesday, whatever

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:27.800
the end count is, but on the election that occurs on Tuesday, he will be elected on January

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:28.800
20th.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:34.000
He will be inaugurated president of the United States.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.700
She's the one that goes to the salon, that's going bankrupt, doesn't wear a mask.

01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:41.280
It's caught not wearing, Oh, but for the TV, she wears it up there on the stage.

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:47.040
I find that that like, uh, uh, sort of that second clip, uh, was useless.

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:51.080
I don't think that that was, I didn't, I didn't hear anything in there that was even like

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.080
suspicious.

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:59.720
No, I think, I think he's just trying to pass off just confidence as my knowledge for knowledge.

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:04.100
But I think that perhaps, but I think even he recognized that was so weak that he had

01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:08.320
to complain about the salon instead of anything that's in the club that is weak to you.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.640
Now the one of Biden sounds a little worse.

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:14.280
And if you think that he was just speaking and then accidentally said that they put together

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:18.600
a voter fraud organization, then you might reach the conclusion that Alex is presenting.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.400
However, that's not Biden misspeaking.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:25.440
It's a clip taken from an interview on pod save America from back in October.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.280
In reality, if the person who found that clip had allowed it to play in full, it would be

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:33.440
painfully obvious that Biden was talking about organizing to stop and avoid instances of

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.600
voter fraud.

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:37.560
But honestly, that's not the best word that he could have used.

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:41.800
What he was referring to is more of the broad spectrum of voter disenfranchisement.

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:45.580
Immediately after the clip stops, Biden goes on to discuss the call-in line that had been

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:49.000
set up to connect people with lawyers who can help if they have trouble voting or face

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.120
intimidation at the polls.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:55.720
These are the sorts of specifics Alex has because it's about appearances, not reality.

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:59.340
That clip sounds really bad, like Biden was accidentally admitting to setting up a voter

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:03.680
fraud organization, but it only does if you only listen to that little snippet.

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:07.240
So you know, you're creating this facade, this veneer, like, oh, we proved it.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:12.200
He admitted it in public, but he's doing that to sort of not talk about it that much.

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:14.520
Because I don't think he wants to talk about it that much.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:18.120
He wants to talk about this goddamn caravan, because that's exciting.

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:21.520
And then he also has an emergency message.

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:30.840
All right, I'm going to issue an emergency message to President Trump coming up at the

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:31.840
bottom of the hour.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:36.760
So we've got that message coming up, and I think that that's really where he wants this,

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:37.920
he wants to put his focus.

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:38.920
Sure, sure, sure.

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:44.120
And we'll get to that in a minute, because his focus is never far from one person.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:48.480
One person in this world haunts Alex like a- Keith Olbermann?

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:49.480
Like a weatch.

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.480
Bill Maher.

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:54.800
He's an indeed disgusting pus bucket that they're preparing to remove, and then Kamala

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.960
Harris will probably bring Hillary Clinton in.

01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:59.240
What a time to be alive.

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.160
Indeed, what a time to be alive.

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:04.840
Still trying to fantasy book Hillary into this election.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:10.680
I just don't, I mean, if you want millions of people outside the White House, try and

01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:14.200
trick everyone into getting Hillary Clinton to become president now.

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:17.800
Wouldn't you just be vice president then, and then Kamala Harris would then have to

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.800
step down too?

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.040
No, she would step down, they would trade jobs, you know, constitutional stuff.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.040
Sure.

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.040
Yeah.

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:27.440
So this is where I got, you know, I've already, I think, I think based on our behavior so

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:31.000
far, you can already tell I'm super excited about this convoy.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Yeah.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.280
Now here's where I got real excited.

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:40.600
And then Owen Schroyer is coming in here live, he's live, and he's strong.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:47.040
And he's preparing to deploy on a four day trip to DC and lead a massive caravan where

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.040
you can join it.

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:52.120
And if you decide to join it, it will send a message to the globalist that they are in

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.120
deep trouble.

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:56.240
Everybody always wanted to march on DC.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.240
It's here.

01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:00.240
When the chips are down, what are you going to do now?

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:02.860
Stay with us.

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:07.440
So I felt challenged by that, when the chips are down, what are you going to do?

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.440
Yeah.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:09.440
And I realized.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.320
We're going to join that caravan.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.320
No.

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.640
We have to do an episode on Friday.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.640
Of course we do.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:19.200
We, this is, if there ever was an emergency episode necessary, we got to follow up on

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.200
the caravan.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.200
Yeah.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.200
Yeah.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.200
The caravan is the only thing I care about now.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:24.200
Yes.

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.720
It's the only thing I, because you know what?

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.200
I think that's going to be fun.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.200
Yeah.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.200
I think that's going to be fun for us.

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.200
Yeah.

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:32.720
I even think it's going to be fun for Owen and all the people in the caravan.

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:33.720
You'd forgotten.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:34.720
It's going to be a good time.

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:38.160
You'd temporarily forgotten about Assassin's Creed because this caravan is exciting.

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.160
It's great.

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.160
This is a fun thing.

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:41.160
Yeah.

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.680
I want to, now I kind of want to do a caravan.

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:43.680
Yeah.

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:48.040
You almost, like you can just envision in your head like sad moments of Owen with funny

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.040
music behind it.

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:50.040
Totally.

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.040
Yeah.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.040
God.

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.040
It's just, it's great.

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.160
So it's not going to be a normal regular thing.

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.160
No.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.280
But caravan necessitates.

01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:58.200
We got to do an episode on Friday about the caravan.

01:25:58.200 --> 01:25:59.200
God damn it.

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.680
We won't know if Alex has shown up in DC by the time that episode comes out.

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:02.680
That's true.

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:08.960
It'll have to be decided on Friday, but there'll be plenty of caravan nonsense to get into.

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:09.960
I can't wait.

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:10.960
I can't wait.

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:11.960
Me too.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:12.960
God.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:13.960
It's just going to be a series of banana peels.

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.760
I can't imagine it being anything else.

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:21.440
So Alex teased that he has this emergency message coming up, and here he throws to it.

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:22.440
Okay.

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:23.440
The video is at VAN.video.

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:24.440
It's at Infowars.com.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:29.720
Alex Jones' emergency message to President Trump, do not concede.

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:33.440
There's over a million people conservatively on our streams, over a million listening on

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:34.440
radio stations.

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:37.920
That's 2 million people conservatively.

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:38.920
I love you.

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:39.920
I appreciate.

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:40.920
You're amazing.

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:41.920
I appreciate those that brought you here.

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:46.480
If you decide to spread this video, the president will wake up and say, no, if you don't, we're

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:47.480
doomed.

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:48.480
Here is the report.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.600
I bet if you spread it, it still isn't going to, nah, it'll be fine.

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:56.600
I don't know if Trump's going to see like, Ooh, a lot of shares on that Infowars video.

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:59.760
I better wake up, better snap out of it.

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:04.800
Oh man, that Infowars video has almost as many likes as that dumb tweet I just posted

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:05.800
five seconds ago.

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:07.760
I better change all of my things.

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:10.640
Yeah, this is where I gotta go.

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:11.640
Yeah.

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:16.700
Now I felt cheated by this because the emergency message that he was teasing, I didn't realize

01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:18.660
it was a prerecorded video.

01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:21.000
He just did this so he can leave half an hour early.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.600
He just, oh, that sucks.

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.600
He just leaves.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.600
That sucks.

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:25.600
He just leaves?

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:30.880
No, but you know, he has an emergency message to Trump, so we better find out what it is.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.160
Of course.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:38.000
President Trump, you were about to be approached by Joe Biden and his new COVID-19 commission.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.600
They're going to tell you that, sir, you're going to be blamed for the hundreds of thousands

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:47.560
of deaths unless you sign onto a new lockdown, contact tracing, and even people being taken

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:50.480
from their homes and forced inoculations.

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:56.040
When you sign onto that, you will be confirming that COVID-19 was your fault and legitimizing

01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:00.600
the martial law take down of this country and the complete shutdown of our economy.

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:05.080
This will be the end of the Republic and you, sir, will be known as Benedict Arnold who

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:09.080
allowed it all to happen.

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:12.000
Trump you are going to be approached by Biden's team.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.080
Trump, they are behind you right now.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:20.380
Trump, at midnight you will be visited by 13 ghosts.

01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:25.600
The fourth will give you an envelope, it has the location.

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.720
Come on, man.

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:27.720
What are we doing?

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:28.720
All right.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:32.480
So this is kind of what I think Alex wants to turn this into as opposed to worrying too

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:36.280
much about like, ah, voter fraud or whatever, which feels just dead.

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:39.520
It feels deflated even on Alex's show.

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:45.000
What he wants to talk about is during the 79 days of hell, right, Biden and his transition

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.240
team are going to have some ideas about better ways to address the COVID-19 situation.

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:57.040
So what the real conspiracy is, is they're going to make like a fucking demand of Trump

01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:01.400
that he get on board with their plan, their globalist plan.

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:05.420
And if he doesn't, then they're going to blame the deaths on him.

01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:09.000
But if he does, then they're going to blame the damage to the economy that their evil

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
plans do.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.480
They're going to blame that on Trump.

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:16.800
He has no win situation except to come out and say, go fuck yourselves globalists.

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:20.200
But then even if they do that, they're going to try and use the 25th amendment to take

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:21.200
him out of office.

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:22.200
Sure.

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:28.520
It's really much more exciting than Rudy Giuliani's press conference and the very, very boring

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:31.640
voter fraud claims that Dennis Montgomery is peddling.

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:39.540
I just, you'd think that that press conference should take an entire party down.

01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.000
That's how sad that was.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:47.360
I wanted to laugh at it because it's maybe objectively the funniest thing I've ever heard.

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.360
Yeah.

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.360
And it's confusingly funny.

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:52.400
Everything about it.

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:57.020
What I thought about it is everybody who is like, oh, comedy is going to be good under

01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:58.680
the Trump administration.

01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:04.760
And I'm like, every single thing I've seen of people trying to dunk on this is not as

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:08.720
funny and never will be as it's mere existence.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:09.840
Like you're never going to win.

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:16.900
There's no point in trying comedy over Rudy Giuliani standing next to a porn shop with

01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:19.720
a fucking pedophile right next to him.

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:21.780
It just doesn't get better than that.

01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:24.520
There's no joke that is better than that.

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:30.000
And it's a landscaping place also called Four Seasons.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.200
He himself is an implied pedophile after the 15 year old girl thing.

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:38.280
Like this whole thing is off the rails.

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:39.280
What joke do I have?

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:40.280
None.

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:41.280
None.

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:42.280
Yeah.

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:47.440
So Alex's message to Trump is largely like, you got to talk more shit, man.

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:53.120
It's so essential for you now to not concede the election, but to come out with your bully

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:59.440
pulpit of the oval office and lay out the Newsweek articles and the new scientist articles

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:05.860
and all the documents that Fauci and Gates under Obama's command before you ever got

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:15.840
into office in 2013, 14 and 15 were running the very exact COVID-19 weaponized virus test.

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.480
Trump, you got to use our talking points.

01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:21.880
You've got to get in the oval office and say info wars shit.

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:23.720
That'll really help me out.

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:27.340
Now what's really funny is if you watch the video of this, while Alex is talking, those

01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:31.640
articles flash up on screen and one of them is that article from the scientist.

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:32.640
Oh no.

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:38.440
And right under the headline is an editor's note about how there are conspiracy theories

01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:43.800
connecting this article to COVID-19 and the coronavirus and this is all unsubstantiated.

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:48.560
So even as Alex is trying to show this evidence, there's a, this doesn't work.

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:53.000
He's accidentally fact checking himself?

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.180
So they're going to try and remove Trump early is the thing.

01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:58.240
That's what this emergency message is all about.

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:03.760
Sir, I want you and your advisors to know what they're planning to do to drive you from

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:11.560
office before January 20th and how they're planning to then blame you for COVID-19 that's

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.880
been their plan all along.

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:19.380
If they're able to trick you, then your legacy and all your supporters will be irrevocably

01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:25.280
connected to the COVID-19 deaths and the American people will be persecuted and Americanism

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:30.800
itself will be demonized connected to the Wuhan virus, which is a Chinese communist

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:31.800
bio weapon.

01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:32.800
Ooh.

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:39.360
I would say that history is not going to be super kind to Trump's fans period about their

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:44.120
response to probably not going to go well.

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:49.640
I don't think that's dependent on Trump leaving early or staying until January or being tricked

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:52.480
by imaginary globalists.

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:57.840
I think we're just going to look back and be like, huh, it's not weird how poor responding

01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:03.080
poorly to a public health crisis seemed to be a policy plank.

01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:04.080
Yeah.

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:05.080
Weird.

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.260
Doesn't seem like a good idea.

01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:07.260
That's very strange.

01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:09.600
Uh, my new policy is murder.

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:10.680
It's very weird.

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:11.680
The end.

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:17.140
So anyway, uh, they're going to try and use that 25th amendment to get Trump out.

01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:22.480
They will demand that you who is still president elected under the constitution, implement

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:23.880
these plans.

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:29.760
If you do not immediately agree, they're going to say the 260 plus thousand most of the deaths,

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:37.080
as you know, from something else are on your watch and are on your head and that you are

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:42.640
guilty of this under the 25th amendment and are not fit to be the president of the United

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:43.640
States.

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:49.120
I want to further discredit you, not just with this fraudulent election, but to certify

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:54.640
that fraudulent election by having your own cabinet remove you under the 25th amendment

01:33:54.640 --> 01:34:01.040
because you don't follow the recommendations and orders of Joe Biden's new globalist COVID-19

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.040
task force.

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:03.720
I mean, what's the point?

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:08.000
I don't, I don't understand why.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:15.920
I think what's funny about this is that he's okay in, in his world, all right, we live

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:18.880
in a, they, this is what they would do.

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:23.840
So we do it, but they would do what our plans are that we're doing right now.

01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:24.840
Right?

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:30.200
So I think Alex is actually saying that one, he knows all of this stuff is true.

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:32.600
This is all Trump's fault.

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:38.720
And that the only way, the best way for us to go about this is to use the 25th amendment

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:42.320
to remove him from office, to do all of this stuff early.

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:48.560
Like he's saying that the best plan is doing all that stuff, exactly.

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:52.240
He's telling us what he would do in our situation, right?

01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:55.400
But that's not always still even the best thing to do.

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:59.480
It's not a good plan, but it is funny every time he does this because he's like, here

01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:01.400
is what I would do.

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.800
And that's what they're trying to do already.

01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:04.800
Yeah.

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:11.320
I hear it more like, yeah, it's going to look real bad if competent leadership comes in

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:13.920
and people are like, oh, this is what we've been missing.

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:14.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:15.920
It's going to look real bad.

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:21.480
It's gonna, it's gonna take a whole lot of the like, oh, the deep state, all these weird,

01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:26.200
weird things that have been going on over the past couple of years, these weird excuses

01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:29.400
are all just going to look kind of dumb.

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:33.680
And I think Alex recognizes that and, you know, you got to distract people.

01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:38.840
The only way to do that is to create something fun in that 79 days of hell.

01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:43.960
They're going to try and get rid of Trump before Trump has to leave anyway.

01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:49.400
I mean, the thing that scares me is there's only two ways for Trump to go.

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:58.080
And that is to step down early and have Pence write the most broad pardon in the history

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:04.360
of the United States that somehow also supersedes any and all state crimes that Trump has committed.

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:09.960
Or not leave because anything other than those two and he's going to jail.

01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:12.600
So I think he knows that.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.600
First of all, innocent.

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:14.600
And he's not going to jail.

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:15.600
Innocent until proven guilty.

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:16.600
Sure.

01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:17.600
First of all.

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.600
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:22.080
Second, I don't, I don't know.

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:29.400
I don't know if that's the case, but I could easily see some kind of a brokered immunity.

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:30.400
I mean, I don't know.

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:32.720
There's no, there's just nothing to say.

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:37.240
If he leaves office, he's going to lose all of his money.

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:43.280
Like it's going to be a bloodbath for him personally because he's bad at everything.

01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:47.720
And I think what's going to save us is he's too incompetent to do either of the only two

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:49.240
things that he can do.

01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:50.240
Maybe.

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:51.240
I don't know.

01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:52.240
That's my suspicion.

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:53.240
I think we'll see.

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.320
I'm not entirely sure.

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:55.320
That's my suspicion.

01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:00.920
But Alex is presenting Trump with this position where like, if you're going to be approached

01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:05.800
by a man in a trench coat, then he is going to tell you Biden's secret plan.

01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:10.720
And should you say no to this plan, they will blame you for all deaths.

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:14.640
However, if you say yes to it, here is what you got to do.

01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:15.640
Or here's what's going to happen.

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:20.320
If you follow the lockdown, they will put your name on the coming depression in the

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:27.360
United States and blame you for all the previous deaths, saying later, you actually admitted

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.400
that you were the one behind it all.

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:30.400
Again.

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:31.400
You did.

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:32.400
We have tapes.

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.400
Don't sign onto it.

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:37.920
You've got to come out and expose Fauci, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, and all of them in Oval

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:39.160
Office addresses.

01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:41.920
And that is the only path to stop them.

01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:45.520
So this is the 20% he was talking about earlier, I think.

01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:51.840
Is Trump giving Oval Office addresses where he spouts Infowars conspiracies?

01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:52.840
Yep.

01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:53.840
Alright.

01:37:53.840 --> 01:38:01.520
I guess I think 20% is a embarrassingly high chance to give that of success.

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:02.520
Sure.

01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:06.160
I think as far as Alex goes, this is a great swing.

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:07.480
This is a great swing.

01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:08.720
It's as good as he can do.

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:11.120
Because Trump has nothing left to lose.

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.280
And this would be great for Alex's business.

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:16.320
So why not see if Trump will do some shit for him now?

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:20.800
I think even Alex has to recognize that that's, I think, a fruitless strategy.

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:21.800
Probably.

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:28.240
But I do think that this is better for Alex than getting too hung up on the election stuff.

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:29.240
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:34.160
And also getting too hung up on fucking, like, even addressing Steve's nonsense.

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:35.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:41.080
Like, it's a better game to play that, like, oh, the COVID, it's really about.

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:48.520
Because then that kind of has a stage removed from the, like, strict electoral stuff and

01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:49.520
the parties.

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:52.960
You can still, like, claim that there's something outside of politics, that this is about the

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:54.760
globalist's evil plan.

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:58.160
You know, and I think that that is good for him.

01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:00.600
So I think that that's why he's focusing on this.

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:08.160
And this message to the president, supposedly, is not about fight in Michigan, fight in Pennsylvania.

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:12.480
You know, get there, count the ballots, make sure all of it, you know, like, get Steve

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:13.480
Pachanik on the phone.

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.640
He said it's a sting operation or whatever.

01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:20.520
You know, like, he's not doing that, because, sure, that should live in the background,

01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:21.520
but it's proven already.

01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:22.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:23.520
It's proven already.

01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:24.520
We can move on.

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:25.520
We have to.

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:26.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:27.520
We have to.

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:28.520
Because there's more pressing information.

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:29.520
Exactly.

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:33.240
And that is that Biden's COVID response team is really a Trojan horse to get Trump out

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:39.320
with the 25th Amendment or, you know, that's that's pretty good on his part in terms of

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.680
spin and the way he's playing things.

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:46.640
Let Knight handle Steve Pachanik, get Owen out of the studio for a while.

01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:51.680
Let me try and fucking thread whatever needle that I need to, to try and keep us in business

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:53.000
after next week.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Yeah.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.680
And I think that's about as good as you can get.

01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:58.880
And it's a better strategy than I would have expected.

01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:01.320
Giant publicity stunt out of this caravan.

01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:02.320
Totally.

01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:03.320
Yeah.

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:05.840
No, this is a far better plan than I ever would have expected from them.

01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:07.320
I don't even know if it's a plan.

01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:11.760
I wonder if it's just kind of like, all right, what can we do?

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.200
All right.

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:14.200
This could work.

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:15.200
Yeah.

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:19.160
I don't know if it's some grand machination on their part or anything, but I think it

01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:24.520
fulfills a number of the requirements that get around some of the problems they have.

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:30.840
It's still not a good play because it's still like, I mean, what happens when the 25th Amendment

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.160
isn't invoked?

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:37.200
What happens when these votes are certified and Biden is?

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:40.560
They do need to have the transition teams take over.

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:42.560
What happens in January?

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:46.880
These are only little band-aids you can put on this.

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:50.760
There's still a much larger problem that isn't being addressed by it.

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:55.320
But in terms of being like Alex Jones, where you got to keep moving, the shark of lies,

01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:57.840
piranha of truth, shark of lies.

01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:01.560
In terms of being that guy, it's as good as you can do right now.

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:02.560
And I agree.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:03.560
Yeah.

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:08.200
I wouldn't be surprised if they half-assed their way into an accidental, competent move.

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:11.280
I don't know if it's, again, I don't know if it's competent.

01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.480
Competent, we grate on a curve.

01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:14.480
That's true.

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:15.480
That's true.

01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:16.480
We grate on a curve.

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.480
I have to keep reminding myself.

01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:21.920
I would have expected him to be eating parts of his desk by now.

01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:23.600
That's the curve I'm dealing with.

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:24.600
Yeah.

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:26.680
I make my desk out of survival foods.

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:27.680
Exactly.

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:28.680
Why not?

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:29.680
Yeah.

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:32.720
On this desk, it looks like it's made of glass.

01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:34.400
It's actually sugar.

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.720
You need calories.

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:40.640
On my last episode, I fall into the desk from 20 feet above.

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:42.320
Giving Owen an elbow drop.

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:43.320
Yeah, exactly.

01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:46.600
So on this next clip, Alex is talking, I mean, like, is it?

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:50.280
It's just background dressing that Trump won the election and it was stolen.

01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:51.280
Sure.

01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:53.680
President Trump, the mainstream media has choreographed all of this.

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:55.900
They have fraudulently blamed you for COVID-19.

01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:57.280
The American people do not believe it.

01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:58.280
They know the truth.

01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:02.560
They elect you overwhelmingly and so this new fifth coup of election fraud is designed

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:03.560
to take you out.

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:08.480
If you comply, if you quote, take the olive branch of the neo cons and Mitt Romney and

01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:13.120
George W. Bush and say, okay, I'll follow the recommendations of president elect Joe

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:19.240
Biden to lock things down, to wear the mask, to take inoculations and for contact tracers,

01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:23.240
they will then turn around later and admit that you were repudiated and the deaths were

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:27.320
your fault and legitimize the persecution of your supporters.

01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:30.280
So basically Alex is just being like, for our sake, please seize power.

01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:31.280
Yeah.

01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:34.960
But also the thing I find most interesting about that is that Alex calls Biden president

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:35.960
elect.

01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:36.960
Yeah, I know.

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:38.960
I feel like he would be more petty than that.

01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:39.960
They all know.

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:42.740
I feel like he would be, that's really weird.

01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:44.020
They all know.

01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:46.440
That's really strange.

01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.720
I feel like you can do a second take.

01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:50.480
I know he's a one take guy.

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:51.480
There are cuts in here.

01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.480
Oh, there are?

01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:53.480
Oh yeah.

01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:54.480
Oh my God.

01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:57.480
You mispronounced a word fraudulent a couple of times.

01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:58.480
Yeah.

01:42:58.480 --> 01:42:59.480
Yeah.

01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:00.480
Yeah.

01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:01.480
It's not great.

01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:02.480
Yeah.

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:04.440
But even in this message, uh, that is, you know, like I said, there's, there's some editing.

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:07.840
There's some effort that went into this and it's supposed to be like a message directly

01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:08.840
to Trump.

01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:12.680
There's an elephant in the room that Alex can't even ignore in this message.

01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:15.800
And that is the Trump is not being a leader.

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:17.620
We are waiting for leadership.

01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:19.880
We need the address from the oval office.

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:24.080
We need you to reconfirm in the face of Fox news and the other sellout traders that you

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:29.960
are never going to concede to fraud and sell out the election system in this country.

01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:32.640
We know you're our champion and we stand behind you.

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:35.860
So even that is kind of like a call out a little bit, man.

01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:43.000
I feel so like Joe Rogan and Alex, like so many of these people are sitting here being

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.240
like, where's Q, where's Trump?

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:47.240
Where's all this stuff?

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:50.520
And it's like, guys, they weren't your friends.

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:51.520
Yeah.

01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:52.680
They've been using you.

01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:53.680
Yeah.

01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:54.880
I'm the fool here.

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:57.760
I know you can't admit it, but that's what you got to get.

01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:00.720
You just brought up Joe Rogan, so I need to say two things real quick.

01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:06.520
Someone sent me a message about Tim Dillon on Joe Rogan's show and they pointed out to

01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:12.420
me that Tim Dillon is a sober person, like, or I don't know if like recovery or whatever,

01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:16.560
or if he's just straight edge or whatever, so he doesn't drink or smoke.

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:21.880
We were saying that he was high and it was because he had kept saying he was high, but

01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:26.040
I realized that what he was probably saying is he's high, like because he's around Alex

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:29.880
or something high on the excitement and I misspoke and I apologize about that.

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:32.720
I didn't mean to imply Tim was high when he wasn't.

01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:33.840
I don't know anything about him.

01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:36.640
No, neither do I, and that's why I made that mistake.

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:37.640
Easy to make.

01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:38.640
Second.

01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:40.360
I'm glad he's an asshole without PEDs.

01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:41.360
Second.

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:47.320
I think I had this fantasy that Rogan, like, you know, he's like, I just rationalize having

01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:48.320
Alex on my show.

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.320
Sure.

01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:53.840
I was thinking about how fun it would be if he's like forced to have Alex's friends on

01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:54.840
the show.

01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:58.440
It's like, yeah, all right.

01:44:58.440 --> 01:44:59.440
Okay.

01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:00.440
You want Alex on there?

01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:01.680
You got to bring a Pechenek on there.

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:03.880
Steve Pechenek is going to come fuck with you for a little while.

01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:07.800
If you want to say that this guy's sources and shit are backed up and we've got a fact

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:12.640
checker right there, let's bring Dr. Pechenek right next to you and see how that goes.

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:15.720
Next episode, Stuart Rhodes of the Oath Keepers is here.

01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:17.560
Let's fucking dance that dance, Joe.

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.220
You want to do this, do it.

01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:23.080
Next time, Vox Day is coming in.

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:24.080
And now...

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:25.080
Nick Fuentes.

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:30.360
Florida Congresswoman-elect Laura Loomer is coming up on that.

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:33.280
I don't think it's outside the possibility that Loomer has been on Rogan.

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.280
That doesn't...

01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:35.280
I don't think she has.

01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:36.280
I don't think so either.

01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:37.280
Yeah, I just had that fantasy.

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:38.360
That seemed pretty fun.

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:40.040
That would be very fun.

01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:41.720
Forcing Rogan to have Alex's friends on.

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:42.720
Come on.

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.280
If you want to have Alex back again, sit down with these ding-dongs.

01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:46.280
Wrestle with that bullshit.

01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:49.000
John Rappaport coming on the Rogan Experience.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.920
Is that Batman appearing from the bushes?

01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:57.720
So anyway, Alex brings up a headline in his address to Trump.

01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:00.120
This is one of his current talking points.

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:07.120
And now, President Trump, we have the head of the UK military, their Secretary of Defense,

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:13.080
their chairman of their Joint Chiefs, of their defense staff, General Sir Nick Carter, coming

01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:18.240
out and saying this lockdown could trigger World War III and there's an extreme danger

01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:21.920
of it and that another lockdown is not needed.

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:26.060
So this is a headline of an article that Alex didn't read about an interview with General

01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:31.480
Sir Nick Carter on Sky News, where he discussed how the continuing COVID-19 situation and

01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:36.560
some of the economic ramifications of it around the world has the potential to exacerbate

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:39.500
regional conflicts that already exist.

01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:43.440
Many people don't feel like regional conflicts are too relevant to their lives, but Carter

01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:47.860
was trying to point out that, quote, rhythms of history showed that localized tensions

01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:51.320
can easily ratchet up and drag nations to war.

01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:55.060
What he was saying is that regional conflict can often escalate when it's miscalculated

01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:56.320
and ignored.

01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:00.560
He said, quote, if you look back at the last century, before both world wars, I think it

01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:06.520
was inarguable that there was escalation which led to the miscalculation, which ultimately

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:10.000
led to war at a scale we hopefully never see again.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.240
His comments weren't meant to imply that dealing with COVID-19 could cause a third world war,

01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:18.400
and he never said that measures that Alex would exaggerate into calling lockdowns are

01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:19.880
unnecessary.

01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:24.080
That's Alex's imagination about what an article he hasn't read says based on his impression

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:25.360
of the headline.

01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:30.560
The interview is given to celebrate Remembrance Sunday, a UK day of commemoration for the

01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:34.400
service persons of their country who participated in the two world wars.

01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:38.480
Given this context, the General's comments and the interview made a lot more sense, but

01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:42.940
it's exactly this context that Alex makes it his job to deprive his audience of.

01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:46.440
It's bad enough when the intended audience is some listener who might buy dumb pills,

01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:49.720
but it's another thing when he's imagining that he's conning the president with this

01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:51.960
bullshit.

01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:53.100
It makes total sense.

01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:58.840
This is a Remembrance Sunday interview about these world wars and the concern that regional

01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:03.880
conflicts can grow and engulf other people.

01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:04.880
Yeah.

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:05.880
Yeah.

01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:09.820
I mean, you know, World War One was a rich guy got killed and then a bunch of cousins

01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:12.080
fought each other, you know?

01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:14.520
So we have one last clip here, Jordan.

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:18.200
And this is such a metaphor.

01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:23.960
This is a audio metaphor for Alex Jones's dumb, dumb message to Trump.

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:28.160
Mike down for this because I want you to experience this in its fullness.

01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:32.800
We're still on air at mfullwars.com forward slash show and band.video and we're going

01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:38.280
to be making major announcements later this evening about massive caravans from all corners

01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:43.920
of the United States, descending on Washington, D.C. in the next few days, led by mfullwars.com

01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:45.960
and more action we're about to take.

01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:49.200
Mr. President, we don't just have your back.

01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:52.640
Attention business owners, body slammed by overwhelming debt.

01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:55.280
Just just amazing.

01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:59.660
Just I can't even I can't say enough about that.

01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:05.400
This is a commercial for Four Seasons Land, it would be amazing.

01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:07.680
Oh, God, that would have been beautiful.

01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:11.640
This is a video that Alex prerecorded so he could leave work early so he could give a

01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:14.440
message of desperation to the president.

01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:18.720
And it, first of all, ends with a plug for infowars.com forward slash show.

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:19.720
Of course.

01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:22.200
He's plugging that in his message directly to the president.

01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:25.560
Well, I mean, if Joe Arpaio is going to plug his book in a message to me.

01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:26.560
What a dick.

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:27.560
What a dick.

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:32.720
But that does imply like, OK, the message to Trump part is kind of part of the performance.

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:33.720
Sure.

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:35.520
I think it's painfully obvious.

01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:38.680
And then it's just hilarious that they mistimed it and he got cut off by the break.

01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:41.400
You know how long it is.

01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:42.400
You do.

01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:43.400
You do.

01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:44.400
To the second.

01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:45.400
Yes.

01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:46.400
It is recorded already.

01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:47.400
There's numbers on there.

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:48.400
You can see it.

01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:50.400
Three zero colon zero one.

01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:51.400
Yep.

01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:54.280
Don't run it till twenty eight fifty.

01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:57.800
There's no reason that you need to be getting cut off by the break and your important message

01:49:57.800 --> 01:49:58.800
to the president.

01:49:58.800 --> 01:49:59.800
It's just not possible.

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:03.440
It's a recognition that this is performance art for the audience.

01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:08.320
And then second, it's also an admission that, like, it's not as important as commercials.

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:09.320
None of this actually means anything.

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:11.440
We don't really care about getting the whole message in.

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:13.720
It's kind of just the fact that we did it.

01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:14.720
We like.

01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:16.120
And hey, Trump, get excited.

01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:17.960
These Carol fans are coming.

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:18.960
Great thing to say.

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:20.900
We've got your back.

01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:23.000
Are you having the overwhelming debt?

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:28.840
Just so good, because it's in the statement of we've got your back and then you literally

01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:30.680
disappear.

01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:31.680
It's just perfect.

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:37.360
Yeah, imagine if you're Trump listening to it, he's like, what else?

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:39.800
Not only do I have your back, what else?

01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:41.640
It's an important message.

01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:42.640
Pills.

01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:43.640
I've got pills.

01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:45.240
I got your back and I got pills.

01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:52.760
So we come to the end of this and I ought to say, you know, rare need for a Friday episode,

01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:54.840
but this caravan demands it.

01:50:54.840 --> 01:51:00.800
I'm excited to follow the adventures of Owen Schroyer across these United States.

01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:04.200
I'm excited to see what kind of goofs happen.

01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:06.520
I wish I was there desperately.

01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:10.120
This caravan has breathed new life into me.

01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:11.840
This is very exciting.

01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:19.520
And I just, whoever they hire, I know they've got somebody with cameras, you gotta give

01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:21.840
us the raw footage.

01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:24.420
It should be 24-7 filming.

01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:27.920
This should be a fucking David Attenborough documentary.

01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:29.160
Like that's what we're dealing with here.

01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:34.120
There should be, the bus or whatever they're using to go down there should be like hardwired

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:35.880
video audio at all times.

01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:36.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:38.080
Werner Herzog is there.

01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:40.200
Werner Herzog has to be there.

01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:41.200
Yeah.

01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:46.320
The potential for this just to be an amazing story that might never get told, it's too

01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:47.320
high.

01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:48.320
It's too high.

01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:49.320
I know.

01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:50.320
I know.

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:51.320
Oh, dude.

01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:52.320
Well, we'll do our best.

01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:53.960
Yes, we got this.

01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:54.960
And we'll see you then.

01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:55.960
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:56.960
We do have a website.

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:57.960
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:51:57.960 --> 01:51:58.960
Yep, or also on Twitter.

01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:02.060
It's at knowledge

01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:04.920
We are Facebook.

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:09.020
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:10.020
doing God's work.

01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:11.020
Yep.

01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:12.020
We'll be back.

01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:13.020
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:14.020
I'm Leo.

01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:15.020
I'm DZX Clark.

01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:16.020
I'm Darryl Arundus.

01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:18.600
I think it's totally fine if you watch Dancing with the Stars.

01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:19.600
Andy in Kansas.

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:20.600
You're on the air.

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:21.600
Thanks for holding.

01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:22.600
Hello, Alex.

01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:23.600
I'm a first time caller.

01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:24.600
I'm a huge fan.

01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:25.600
I love your work.

01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:30.600
I love you.
