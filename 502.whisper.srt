1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,880
N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,160
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys, knowledgefight.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,080
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:01:02,320
Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan, I'm Jordan, we're a couple dudes,

8
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,920
I like to sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Emmerich

9
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,920
Jones.

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,920
Oh indeed we are Dan.

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
Jordan.

12
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Dan!

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
Jordan.

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Quick question.

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
What's up?

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,920
What's your bright spot today?

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,560
What's your favorite part of Assassin's Creed Valhalla?

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,240
So I've had a little bit of time to sit with the game and I'm excited first of all to be

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
out of the snow now.

20
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,440
I've gotten to the point where I'm not just running around in the snowbank and that's

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,100
nice.

22
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,720
But also that they brought back the homesteading aspect of Assassin's Creed 3 that I love so

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
much.

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,200
I love the idea of just building up a little settlement and all that.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,760
It was something I was really missing from the last two games.

26
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,080
I do enjoy that quite a bit.

27
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
It's fantastic.

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
I love it so much.

29
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,360
I've enjoyed, I still have obviously not played nearly as much as you, but I've enjoyed quite

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,880
a bit of the things that they fixed.

31
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,280
I think they fixed a lot of things that were kind of little hurdles in the past ones and

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
I appreciate that.

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
I think it's an improvement.

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
It's very very good.

35
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
I enjoyed it immensely.

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,360
I look forward to dabbling around and playing it for the next very long time probably.

37
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,000
It's going to be an insane amount of time.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,400
Seems like a very large thing.

39
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,720
So the thing is, because I finished the audiobook and then it came out, I'm out of all other

40
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
work.

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,040
This is my reward, so I'm just putting hours upon hours into it.

42
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
It's good.

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,040
And I swear to you, I don't think I've gotten out of the, I still think the title card is

44
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
coming.

45
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
You still think you're in the intro.

46
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
Yeah, exactly.

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
It's big.

48
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,760
That's good, though, in terms of what the genre and the style of the game is.

49
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
That's what you came there for.

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
Yeah, totally.

51
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
So what's your Bright Spot?

52
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,440
My Bright Spot, Dan, is one...

53
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
Also...

54
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
No, no, no, no.

55
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,000
It is one Leslie Jones on the reboot of Supermarket Sweep, Dan.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It is fantastic.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,080
This is the first I'm hearing about this.

58
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
Delightful.

59
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
I didn't know that existed.

60
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
No, it's so great.

61
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,280
The old guy was fantastic.

62
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,040
He was just that white guy who was five foot three and hosted a show.

63
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,120
And Leslie Jones hosts the show exactly how I would host the show and watches the Sweep

64
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,800
exactly how I watch it.

65
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Like incredibly seriously?

66
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,080
Yeah, no, no, no, no.

67
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Like this.

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Get the goddamn turkeys!

69
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
Oh, okay.

70
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,440
That is exactly what I would do, and it's perfect.

71
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
That is great.

72
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
It's beautiful.

73
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,760
There's only two ways to go with it.

74
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,800
One is like that, and I think that's the better option.

75
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
Totally.

76
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,320
But the other one is treat it like incredibly serious, just straight-faced, like it's an

77
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
athletic competition.

78
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Joe Bucket.

79
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,160
All right, he's coming down the corner and he's taking that.

80
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,200
He's got the cup of coffee.

81
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
That's $300.

82
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
All right, he's going to go back.

83
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
He's going to take the...

84
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,800
I think Andy Daley could do that really well, but it would be much more difficult to pull

85
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,760
off in an entertaining, funny way.

86
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
That's awesome.

87
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
I didn't know that existed.

88
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,900
I used to love watching Supermarket Sweep when I would stay home from school sick.

89
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,400
Every part of the show is better than what you remember, and Leslie is incredibly good.

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,560
Well, I'm thrilled to hear that congratulations, Leslie Jones, and congratulations to all

91
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,840
the people on the cast and crew.

92
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,360
So Jordan, today we are on our day off and we're coming in, because we have to.

93
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
There's a convoy deal.

94
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,440
Duty calls.

95
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,040
And if I hadn't had to pour over as much stuff as I have to get this episode ready, I was

96
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,360
going to surprise you by putting on a trucker cap.

97
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

98
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
I was expecting something.

99
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,200
I was expecting to open with Eastbound and Down something, something, yeah, yeah.

100
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
No, no, no.

101
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
C.W. McCall.

102
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Convoy.

103
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
All right, all right, all right.

104
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
That's the song for truckers.

105
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Okay.

106
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,880
Eastbound and Down is for people who wish they were truckers.

107
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,680
C.W. McCall is for the real, the real Streak.

108
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,400
I didn't realize we had hipster truckers now too.

109
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Yeah, definitely.

110
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Okay, all right.

111
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,680
So we have quite a bit of nonsense to go over.

112
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,980
Over the span of November 9th to 11th, 2020, I'm Dan, this is 2020, and yeah, this is,

113
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,000
this is gonna, this has been fun for me.

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,080
I'll say that.

115
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
All right, that's good.

116
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
I'm excited.

117
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Uh huh.

118
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,480
And I, I've decided that this series is going to have a name because Monday is the conclusion

119
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
of it.

120
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
Sure.

121
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,400
Because we don't know what happens, because Alex hasn't gotten down to DC.

122
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
He's not there yet.

123
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,600
And it would be legitimately impossible for me to cover everything by now.

124
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,240
So what I've done is I've broken it up into two chunks, and we're calling this Dan's Cara

125
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,320
Vanity Project.

126
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm going to have to take words away from you, I'm just going to have to take them away

127
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
from you.

128
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
I'm going to have to keep them.

129
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,920
And if you want to use them, you can ask me.

130
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,880
Well, see, I was thinking about it and it was like a written request.

131
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
I was sitting there.

132
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,520
I was like, this is kind of a vanity project for me, Cara Vanity Project.

133
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
This is amazing.

134
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,760
Jordan's going to hate it.

135
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Yes.

136
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,760
Yeah.

137
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,640
That was even worse because I know how long it took you.

138
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,160
It was good.

139
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,840
That was my second thought after coming up with it.

140
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,440
It's like, Jordan's going to be furious.

141
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,240
No, it's fantastic.

142
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,680
So we'll get down to my Cara Vanity Project in a moment, but before we do, we got to take

143
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,520
a moment to say thank you to some folks who signed up and are supporting the show.

144
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,120
So first, ominous warning.

145
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Thank you so much.

146
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
You are now a policy wonk.

147
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
I'm a policy wonk.

148
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,240
No thank you, ominous W. Someone heeded the calls for ominous warnings.

149
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Next, Nate.

150
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
Thank you so much.

151
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
You are now a policy wonk.

152
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,240
I'm a policy wonk.

153
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Thanks, Nate.

154
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Thanks, Nate.

155
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,640
Next, Jessie G. That's Jessie with an I.

156
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Thank you so much.

157
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
You are now a policy wonk.

158
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
I'm a policy wonk.

159
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
Thanks, Jessie.

160
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,200
Next, Phil T. Thank you so much.

161
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,760
You are now a policy wonk.

162
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
I'm a policy wonk.

163
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,920
Thank you very much, Phil.

164
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,720
Next, Jeb P. Thank you so much.

165
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,040
You are now a policy wonk.

166
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,280
I'm a policy wonk.

167
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
Thanks, Jeb.

168
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,720
Next, Jeb exclamation point.

169
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Yeah, well, obviously.

170
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,000
Obviously obviously next Elizabeth B. Thank you so much. You're now policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk

171
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,080
Thank you, Elizabeth. Thank you next Joshua H. Thank you so much. You're now policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Thanks Joshua

172
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:11,000
Next the conspiracy grows larger. No last name given Chris. Thank you so much. You are now policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk

173
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Thank you Chris. Welcome to the club

174
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,960
Then finally, I'd like to say thank you to somebody who donated on elevated level and we appreciate that very much

175
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,000
So Sailor Moon's spirit sister Stephanie B. Thank you so much. You are now a technocrat

176
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,240

177
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,240
We got to go full tilt boogie on this Watson. All right, let's just get down to business

178
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,760
We ain't making that money off that heroin. Why you pimps so good. My neck is freakishly large. I declare

179
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,220
Infowar on you. Thank you so much Sailor Moon's spirit sister Stephanie. Yes. Thank you very much

180
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,320
If you're out there listening and you're thinking hey, I enjoy the show. I'd like to support these gents, too

181
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,640
You can do that by going to our website knowledgefate.com clicking the button that says support the show or what you can do is

182
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,680
Get yourself a big old cart run it up and down the metaphorical grocery aisle. Do not forget the turkeys

183
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,980
Those are a hundred dollar ball. Make sure that you get what's on the shopping list this week. That's an extra

184
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,040
$250. Dan if you get the bear you're gonna want to get the triple bonus

185
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,920
that's $300 Dan and take that all down to your local charity or bail fund and

186
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,200
Donate that not bad. Yeah, not bad. Thank you

187
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,920
Let me ask you this really quick about the new supermarket sweep

188
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,480
Is it all the same stuff has the same bonuses as the old one or did they flip up?

189
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,040
What items you need to get? Yeah, they flipped up items, but it's still it's still coffee and

190
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
Yeah, yeah. Yeah the spirit and now you also can toss in like

191
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,400
A thermoses and shit like it's great. It's fantastic. I'm gonna have to watch this myself. It's wonderful

192
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
I'm gonna have to get on this immediately do it

193
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
episode over

194
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,800
So Jordan on our Wednesday episode we learned of the new infowars plan to run a caravan from Austin

195
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,640
Texas down through the south then upward along the East Coast arriving on Friday in Washington DC the idea

196
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,360
I guess is that the cavalry is coming, you know

197
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,280
It's the troops that Trump needs to fight off the globalist menace, but the actual reality is a little less noble

198
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,680
That'll sound right on an optics level

199
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,920
the goal is very

200
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,940
Obviously meant to provide Trump with an appearance that he could use to make claims that the people are demanding that he fight back

201
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:26,640
Against the election results because he lost this caravan is an attempt on the people's part to turn themselves into human props

202
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,060
Which Trump can use to justify an authoritarian power grab on a deeper level. This is Alex attempting to pull off an outstanding

203
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
overly ambitious and

204
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,480
Protracted publicity stunt he's hoping that sending dumb dumb Owen Shroyer out to barn store in the eastern

205
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,680
Side of the country will force the media to pay attention to them in his mind

206
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,480
Owen's going to pick up a couple hundred patriots in Austin then by the time he reaches Houston

207
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,520
The number will be in the thousands and by the time they hit DC. It'll be a mass of people

208
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,680
It'll be impossible to ignore. Yeah, that sounds right. This is not what's gonna happen

209
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,600
So failing that he's hoping that people with big social media reaches will be unable to resist

210
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,260
Meming the fuck out of clips of Owen on the road and he'll be able to drive some traffic that way

211
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,380
The final thing that this stunt accomplishes is that it provides something with a drastic

212
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,800
immediacy that can distract the audience for realizing that if anything Alex says means anything

213
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,020
No number of people showing up in DC is gonna mean a damn thing

214
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,020
Because Alex has already said that the globalists are gonna kill everyone no matter what and that even if Trump is successful

215
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,640
There's a plan B that the Patriots can't stop

216
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,100
in this sense the caravan serves as the shitty

217
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:41,500
Shiny set of keys that Alex can jingle around to keep people from canceling auto-ship if at the end of the election

218
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,840
Biden has won. We need to kill everyone and overthrow the United States government

219
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,180
Biden just won. We're gonna go on a road trip. Hold on

220
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,620
I bought a URL

221
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,860
Literal devil has won. Let's get on the road. Hey caravan

222
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:09,180
Look, we're already just bullshitting about the apocalypse and the devil. Why not create our own tribulation? It's fantastic. Yeah

223
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,980
All that being said I love this

224
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,720
It's my favorite thing that infowars has done in a long time

225
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,060
Partially because it's so naked and transparent terrible if this ends up being anything notable

226
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,380
It'll be a collection of people whose various scams are in danger if Trump is out of office

227
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,620
It could easily end up being like the Rocky Mountain rendezvous

228
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,860
but you replace the Nazis and white power groups with pill salesmen and YouTube commentators who just now realize that they've

229
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,300
Overplayed their hands and they're in way too deep on another level

230
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,780
This also scratches a very particular itch for me and that's that I fucking love a road trip

231
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:49,000
I love road trips so much that I I've kind of fond memories of Tom Green's movie road trip

232
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
back when I was younger me and my friends would often just embark on random trips for the sake of driving a couple hours or

233
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,400
A day away to see what was there totally cool

234
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,600
Sometimes there was a destination but other times it was just the experience of being out on the road

235
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,960
Seeing things that weren't part of our normal routine, which was the actual reward itself

236
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,840
I loved that and it's one of the things that I feel is most missing for my adult life and probably a big part of

237
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,080
Why I dream of getting an RV and wandering the country

238
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:23,120
Yeah, so this caravan has been branded the stop the steel caravan and I cannot not pay all the attention in the world

239
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,880
Can they not have come up with a better name than stop the steel? That's terrible

240
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,800
Well, it is but they're trying to piggyback this stop the steel momentum that people like Ali Alexander have been pushing for a little while

241
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,160
I'm criticizing them for choosing that name as well

242
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,520
Then we gotta go all the way back. It's a terrible name. Well, we gotta go all the way back to 2016 the election

243
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,380
And the fake poll watching organization that Roger Stone started and got sued over all the way

244
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,300
yeah, there's a connection there, but I'm not sure what it is and I

245
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,800
It's it's frustrating to me

246
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,760
Something's up passing the torch an article from the Southern Poverty Law Center traced the current pushers of the term

247
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,800
Stop the steel strangely to be a number of new far-right folks who are connected to Roger Stone

248
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,080
Yeah, people like Jack Pessobek Mike Cernovich and Ali Alexander

249
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:18,620
their amplification of it reached other fringe figures like Michelle Malkin and faith faith Goldie and then even Trump's son Eric who pushed the

250
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,140
Term on to a larger audience. It's hard not to feel like all of this somehow still traces back to stone

251
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,160
But I can't prove it and it drives me nuts. He's everywhere

252
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,280
It's important to recognize before we get too far into any of this

253
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,480
There are two threads to keep distinct both of them which are branded stop the steel

254
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,800
The first is a series of depressing protests that are being organized around the country

255
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:45,280
Some of them may be organically started and organized and some may be astroturfed by tea party groups and right-wing money

256
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:51,720
They wants the result of the protests, but definitely doesn't want to be associated with them. That's really a smaller issue to me

257
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,960
What's organic and what's not it's something that I think a great investigator will probably publish a piece about in about a year

258
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,780
What's definitely true about these protests is that they're being amplified and pushed by this network of desperate Trump scammers

259
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,540
The second thread is Alex's caravan, which is spiritually connected to these protests

260
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,460
But is also trying to selfishly profit off them as well

261
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:20,460
Alex's publicity stunt is not about bringing more attention to these protests and it's an attempt to take whatever energy these protests might

262
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,620
Generate and steal it to increase the spotlight on his tank with a huge infowars logo on it

263
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:32,660
It's it's almost like this is a a conference of scammers and Alex is trying to scam them

264
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:39,600
Yeah, yeah, it is. It is lowly. It's totally like maybe maybe you have to scam them to get into the scam conference

265
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,240
You know, it's like an entry don't don't invite Alex to Conman Island. Yeah, exactly

266
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,260
Yeah, this has been Alex's mo as it relates to protests for most of his career

267
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,740
He just uses them to self aggrandize himself make the protest about him. This is no different, of course

268
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,540
That's why I'm treating Alex's caravan stunt as a separate thing from the protests

269
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:04,200
Even though they're technically both as part of the same desperation strategy that's being used by these doomed grifters

270
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,080
It's simultaneously more simple and more complicated than the sad protests themselves. Totally

271
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,540
I will say that as I'm preparing this episode

272
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,260
It does not look good

273
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,840
like and we're like the caravan has really set the world on fire if you judge by the number of views that the videos on

274
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,780
Band.video have the kickoff video in Austin has about a hundred thirty seven thousand views

275
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,000
But the drop-off from there is quite notice. Oh, is it? Yes

276
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,940
It doesn't feel like this is working out so far and that being said I

277
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,940
Still would give anything to have been able to go along for the ride 100%

278
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,700
I feel like I could have written my own fear and loathing long after the campaign trail

279
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,020
2020 if I would have been allowed to go

280
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,220
But sadly that will never be

281
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:51,440
For now the best I can do is this two-part series on our podcast about the tour Owen Schroyer is taking from Austin up to

282
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,300
DC based on the information available to me from afar

283
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,620
Since the timing is what it is

284
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:02,340
This is gonna be part one wherein we'll discuss what happened on the caravan tour between its launch on November 9th

285
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:09,780
And then to the end of Alex's show on Wednesday, November 11th after that we'll pick up on Monday's episode

286
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:16,540
So we'll wrap things up with the Wednesday evening, Thursday, and then the event in DC understood

287
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,340
This is very very stupid and I fucking love it. It's incredible. I love it. Yes so much

288
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:21,620
Yeah

289
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,540
I can't I can't believe the main reason that you do a caravan is because you believe

290
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,340
Wholeheartedly that you're going to pick up momentum along the way, right?

291
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:30,820
You know

292
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:38,120
It's gonna start out as a small thing and then it's gonna snowball and you know the premise before you even begin the moment

293
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,420
They said caravan. I knew it was going to fizzle out in the way that a firework

294
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:50,500
Should fizzle it like an inverse firework. Mm-hmm, you know, it's going to explode fizzily. Yeah, I don't know

295
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:56,460
I mean don't get ahead of yourself with predictions. Okay, but I mean, we'll see. We'll see what all this what goes down

296
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:02,740
All right, but before we do here is an out-of-context drop from today's show. I am the president. I am the president

297
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:10,100
I am the 46 president. Alex has declared himself the president. That'll do it. That's the indication of where he's at

298
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:15,380
I'm pretty sure CNN called it for him as well as a real aberration on the polling night

299
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:21,380
So I'm not positive if David Knight had any caravan business on November 9th

300
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:27,500
and I'll hopefully never know because I didn't listen to his show and I'm not going to yeah, so we start on November 9th on

301
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,740
Alex's show and

302
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:35,740
He's trying to keep spirits high. There's still a chance Trump can win this thing. Okay, there is still a

303
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
chance

304
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,220
For Trump

305
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,220
to win the election

306
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,620
Fairly and squarely, but I was sitting in one of the offices this morning

307
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,860
about 12 feet away from a trash can and

308
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:59,420
and I said watch this and I threw a little Gatorade container and banked it off the wall and a file cabinet and into the trash I

309
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,220
Am the president now. That's how Trump's got to get around this fraud. Yeah, man

310
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Get around the road with a bank shot

311
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,660
Trying to bank around is the law. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The law is a huger issue

312
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,120
That's why you got to do a bank shot instead of a straight ahead

313
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,580
Imagine the law as a wall, right?

314
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,420
You cannot if we're gonna build a wall bunk bunk. Yeah, you can't do that. All right

315
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:30,580
Well, they can and they will if everyone bullhorns the White House. That'll do it call the White House

316
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,100
the Bullhorn the White House

317
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,620
The Bullhorn Marlago Trump's back and forth the point is is let

318
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,220
Him know what's happening and what's unfolding and I can tell you

319
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:50,020
That I can sit there and I can get on the phone with folks very close to the president or the president if I need

320
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:55,020
To I don't have a day or two to sit there by the telephone many times. They've called I've missed the calls

321
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,140
I missed some of the calls already the last few days. I cannot shit

322
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,320
by the telephone for a call from Trump, I

323
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,900
Cannot sit by the telephone to do this

324
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,100
It makes me sick. I take a nap or I'm on the air. Boom

325
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,220
I missed the phone call every time I'm at Trump calls

326
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,980
When I nap

327
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:25,500
No, what happens is every time I go to call him he's in the middle of calling me and then the line is busy

328
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,220
Dan yeah, man. I

329
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:34,100
Don't think this is a good angle because Alex has already said multiple times that he and Trump are literally psychically connected. Yeah

330
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,140
so I

331
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:44,380
Really don't think they understand that his advice and essentially bully your fearless leader into taking over as a dictator

332
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:50,820
Yeah, I mean that's really what it seems exactly. It seems like what they're there. They're their whole thing is yeah

333
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,940
Yeah, yeah be a bully to a guy that we think is

334
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,580
Unbullyable even though we obviously know if we just bitch at him. Apparently he'll do whatever we want

335
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,580
well, I mean that's kind of the premise of the

336
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:07,220
the the caravan as a whole is like that is directed at Trump

337
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,480
Yeah, exactly. It's not really for us. No

338
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,140
Absolutely not the caravan isn't really even to support Trump. It's to yell at Trump bully

339
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,860
It's to give him one last chance to be a fucking dictator already

340
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,000
That's kind of the idea it does feel like that yeah, that's a real depressing thought it is

341
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,080
In all ways. Yeah in conception and execution. It's very bad every part of it

342
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,760
I love that Alex is saying like I take this nap and then I miss Trump's call and

343
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Recently, we've seen that Alex thinks that he gets prophetic visions and naps. Yeah, that's true

344
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,940
I mean you got to choose one or the other did he get the call in the nap?

345
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,360
He might have that's probably explain everything. Yeah

346
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:47,640
Yeah

347
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,560
So anyway, everyone else in the world is too dumb to see what Alex can see everything is so clear to him and you

348
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,560
Fucking idiots just won't get to get it together

349
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,120
And so America will probably burn that sounds right

350
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,520
I mean, I really feel like I'm on the planet of morons here and I'm not saying that in elitist way

351
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,640
I mean, we know their exact next moves. They're gonna call 25th amendment. They're gonna say all the deaths for Trump's fault

352
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
They're gonna say while he's president-elect

353
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,080
running his fake task force

354
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,060
Biden that Trump's got to do what he's saying or the deaths are in its hands to make himself look legitimate

355
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,080
Trump cannot assault

356
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,600
The statements Biden makes he has to assault the whole fraud of the scam and lay it all out in damn

357
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:36,520
White House addresses and it's over for these maggots, but everyone wants to argue every facet of the scam

358
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,840
instead of the entire

359
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,280
Enchilada of the fact that it's bad. It's like arguing

360
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,440
strategies with the former Soviet Union instead of looking at the Soviet Union being run by evil people and

361
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,800
And

362
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,380
Look if we don't get the funds to fund this place. I don't care

363
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,280
I'm ready to shut this down if America wants to lose and go down the tubes and burn in hell

364
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:03,360
That's fine. Sounds like a great patriot. It sounds like a guy who loves America so much

365
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,800
I'll stand with America no matter what or I'll throw a little tantrum and say you should all die and you can all burn

366
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:16,400
If I can't pay rent on my gigantic studio, I'm so patriotic and so much you cannot help me

367
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,560
You live in million-dollar homes. Yeah, I just will hope you all burn to death

368
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,840
yeah, I mean the pay the the the you know, this Republic is based on the blood of

369
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:32,160
Patriots, uh-huh, and I'll stand up for it as long as I'm a dollar. Absolutely, but that after that he can burn

370
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't know if I'm broke you guys can all burn to hell

371
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,560
Yeah

372
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:41,860
So Alex has this strange thing going on about like how he can't get a hold of Trump and like I just can't sit by

373
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,600
The phone all the time. I've been airing a lot of tapes today

374
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
because

375
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:54,200
I'm officially choking on here at this point. Okay, and it's not because I can't handle the threat of the globalist

376
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,000
I love my crew

377
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,840
Is that we're all stressed out and we're all over the edge and we're and a lot of the crews being more professional

378
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,200
I am some of the crews being not as big as a jerk as I am. I know exactly their damn game plan

379
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,560
I know how to beat them and then I'm telling myself I could probably do more good. The audience is great on the phone

380
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,780
I need to go in my office and and and beg and then get a hold of Don jr

381
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:24,260
And then get the president on the phone and then hope he listens to me about this stuff and there's nothing more

382
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:31,640
Frustrating than missing phone calls from the president and and I'm just sick of it all. I'm sick of it Wow

383
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,200
hmm

384
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,160
Seems like what he is describing is that the normal way he gets a hold of

385
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,960
Anybody is to beg somebody to get a hold of Don jr. It does seem like that's the only way to get there

386
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,040
So that's that's not great on its face

387
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:51,680
It seems like all of Don jr's handlers are doing a lot to keep Alex Jones from getting it or maybe

388
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,520
Maybe they're all like Don jr. Will believe any old bullshit Alex. Please don't get him anywhere near there

389
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:04,000
It's gonna it's gonna blow back on us. He's an idiot. All right, there's a there's a feeling

390
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,600
Yeah of that and Alex is really mad. He is very mad. Of course he is. So he's got to get Owen into studio

391
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,960
Owens got to come in to discuss the launch of the care of I thought Owens already on the care

392
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,680
No, no, it leaves the evening of the night evening of the night. Okay, it's the first

393
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,800
Stop is Austin and five right on the ninth, right?

394
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,140
So he's still he's still there to be in studio

395
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:30,880
And what they do is is basically what we were already talking about about this this whole idea of going to Washington

396
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,260
It's a threat to Trump. Yeah, they're saying basically

397
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:41,660
We will stop supporting you and we're the only people exactly. Yeah. Yeah, you got nobody left, man

398
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,920
I'm more behind Trump now than ever. What about you Owen?

399
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,720
Yeah, and I'm gonna be more behind him for the next I guess

400
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,400
72 days and he better he better rise to the occasion in the next 72 days and save this

401
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,680
Republic or his name is gonna is gonna be you know

402
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:03,160
Not the gold emblem on the side of his buildings and his airplanes. It's sadly gonna be a new

403
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,880
SHI t word, but by the way, did we not call it the 72 days of 79 days of hell?

404
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,600
Ha ha good branding Wow

405
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,040
Yeah

406
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:17,840
So they're just saying they're like hey if you don't do we say we will abandon you and basically you see these scam dudes

407
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Who are gonna show up in DC? Uh-huh, you know like me and it's Traca James Pacific, you know, like our Jack Pacific

408
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,560
You know thus we're the only people who give a shit anymore if they it's if we're we're the oceans 11 taken down

409
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:38,000
Fucking everybody who got in the way. That's what we're doing arguing with everybody who's accurately describing your action. Yeah, exactly

410
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,680
Yeah, why in God's name?

411
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,080
Would you think he's going to step up and be the leader now?

412
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,640
Did you really convince yourself that all you need to do to step up and be a leader is be a belligerent asshole on TV

413
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,160
That's it. I think yeah, I think that's all they needed. Yeah, I think that is what Alex

414
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,200
That's really what they think he fancies himself a leader and he's done very little else. That's fair

415
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,360
Yeah, so Alex has a little bit of an inflated sense of what could come from this caravan. I'll say

416
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,720
It might be a little might be a little bit

417
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,920
Are they gonna reveal that the whole thing was actually a sting operation through this care or not? Okay

418
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,120
The comm was gonna go pretty slow. It's gonna stop a few times a day

419
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,120
so you can you know meet up with it, but if tens of thousands of cars join this and the truckers shut down DC like

420
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:30,120
They're already saying and we use this as a focal point to get other caravans going to DC this Saturday and to hit this Friday

421
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:35,240
It's gonna change the world. So now's the time to take action. Ladies and gentlemen, it leaves at 530 today

422
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:42,000
I don't know if you're gonna get hundreds of thousands of cars now get truckers to shut down DC, but good luck

423
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
No, I doubt it. Yeah

424
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And from what I've seen that might be a little high just a little bit

425
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,880
Unless a person can drive a couple thousand cars themselves

426
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,760
I really feel like what's gonna change the world is that massive scoop Owen has right about how this entire

427
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,440
Election has been a sting does have a scoop. He's got a huge scoop on this. Is he recanted this?

428
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,880
I feel like he needs to just really hammer this home because it's obviously the biggest story of the century

429
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,360
It would be he said it was the biggest news since the election. He did. Yeah, so Alex has got

430
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,720
You know, he's got to pay the bills. Of course. He's just straight-up reading ad copy

431
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,880
Like he's not even he's not committed to doing like pivots or anything

432
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,680
I'm just gonna read this to you because it's the truth

433
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,440
I'm gonna ask as an American patriot

434
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,560
There's somebody that's gonna stand in the gap for you and your family against what's coming down that you support us

435
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,520
I'm gonna read this to you right now because I'm pouring out all the money we got to run these operations

436
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,180
America in crisis emergency lockdown 2 is coming

437
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:59,480
Support info wars in the fight against total economic collapse and by martial law. This guy's is locked down to up to 60% off

438
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,940
Plus free shipping and purple Patriot points on everything. That's a big sale. Yeah, it's a real great great read

439
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,320
Yeah, that's a great read every sale though, man

440
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,040
That's uh, he talks about you know this a lot. He's like I need to get rid of everything

441
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,680
He's got to get rid of everything. Yeah, let me pay for the gas for this caravan. Yeah, I can't be cheap

442
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,760
It's not cheap. No, he's at least two vehicles out there. That tank looks like a gas gun. Yeah

443
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:30,620
God, I can't even imagine. Yeah, so he's running this sale where everything's 60% off free shipping triple patriot points

444
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:37,560
He's done pretty similarly extreme sales and talked about how he needs to sell everything pretty regularly

445
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:44,400
And so that's why this clip is kind of funny. So I had like, you know epoch times calling up

446
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Is it true you're going bankrupt? No

447
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Family. Hey, I hear going out of business

448
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,020
Crew members. I had a few people quit

449
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,100
Today while you're out of business, you know, I'm gonna go work for the blaze or whatever fine

450
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,340
I don't care as long as doing your job. I love you

451
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,180
So, I mean like Alex is the one who keeps acting like he's going out of business

452
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,260
Yeah saying we can't afford to stay in business pretty much non-stop

453
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,580
Yeah, so I don't know I can see where people would get that idea

454
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:14,300
I mean literally saying I've got about a year left of this and I'm going to retire maybe a year left of this

455
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,080
Yeah, really? That was two years ago. So who knows he does do this a lot

456
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,780
Yeah, and then in terms of employees like going and working somewhere else I would too

457
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,060
Yeah, of course constantly said on air that he's gonna have to fire people and he can't afford to pay salary

458
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,380
Exactly. If I heard that from my boss on air, I wouldn't risk it

459
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,700
I wouldn't I heard it one time even if I knew on air. He's a lying piece of shit

460
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,500
I'd be like just it's still in there. Why did it? Yeah, of course

461
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,380
I take the chance that he's not full of shit this time

462
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:47,540
Totally totally leaving you like without a job out of nowhere as opposed to like I'll go find someplace like

463
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:53,380
Fuck Glenn Beck, but I bet he has a better like working fireman. Totally. Yeah

464
00:29:53,380 --> 00:30:00,060
I have to assume I get yelled at every time because I'm 14 and I don't know how to pull up a clip goddamn it

465
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,740
I'm 14

466
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:08,420
So Alex believes or at least is pretending to believe that he is actually responsible for Trump not conceding

467
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:13,700
That sounds right and he wants to see if the American people really are ready to fight for this country and have his back

468
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,700
Too I think there's an element of that because if he sees millions in DC

469
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,060
Well, you notice the White House told me as soon as they saw us now

470
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,860
I don't take the credit as soon as they saw everybody around the country mobilized and they said that's it

471
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,700
Trump told all of them screw you I'm doing it because they specifically mentioned Austin was the last straw

472
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,820
They were seeing that. Yeah, so they saw these people getting together in Austin and they're like, that's a life straw

473
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:40,700
We're not conceding. We're gonna fight this thing. I saw people get together in Austin. Uh-huh. Yep. Yep. The Texan is out

474
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:47,720
Yeah, all right. Okay. Trump has like advisor come up to him. He's like, mr. President the Texan is in play

475
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:56,140
So they talk a little bit about what people are afraid of and I kind of agree with them

476
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:01,460
He's to go right to the fraud right to jail with nobody how Joe's a chai comm agent how he's illegitimate

477
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:07,300
Now America won't accept it and call America out. That's what they're fearing is Trump calling us out to action

478
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,120
I don't agree with anything that he said except for yes, I think very much afraid terrified

479
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,900
Trump calling people like you and your crazy friends into action

480
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:24,020
It's because that would very much cause people to die immediately. Yeah, very immediate. Oh, yeah pretty much instantly

481
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:31,100
Yeah, it would be bad if he just said on TV. I'm calling on Patriots to take over this country action

482
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:35,180
Yeah, we're fucked. Yeah, we're gonna die. They would see that as like a green light

483
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,820
Totally straight-up non-stop mass murder. Yeah

484
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,140
Anyway, Alex said this next clip gives you a reason to think he's going out of business

485
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,140
Which I don't know why he was confused

486
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,720
Their responsibility stay on air plus we have products you already need but it takes money to do it

487
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,960
And we're not bringing in the capital we need right now to keep operating

488
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,760
So I'm watching what I did two months ago that brought in some capital when we last time

489
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:05,160
I we didn't have enough going Wow. Yeah, that's that's why that's almost like he's like, why would you leave?

490
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:10,720
I have been in this situation so many times. I'll figure out a way to pay you eventually. Come on

491
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:18,080
It strikes me as like I and I mean I'm guilty of this too like being like maybe this is the time that he's actually

492
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,960
Completely fucked on the money off totally and I'm I'm so

493
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,280
sort of

494
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,500
decent desensitized to it now that like the time that he is

495
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,360
Actually fucked. Yeah, I probably will just think a guy. Yeah doing it again. All right, whatever

496
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,200
So we get to a little bit of information here and this is about the vaccine

497
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:47,520
Candidate that Pfizer short has released information about I bet it's true boy. Alex doesn't know shit about this

498
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:54,400
That's not a surprise al rallies 1,100 points is up more that was this morning spoke the Dow Jones industrial average hits record as Pfizer

499
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,440
Says kovat 19 vaccine is more than 90% effective and cue up that clip though

500
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,240
I think it's on this list here governor Cuomo cannot said I don't care what he says

501
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,320
It's not safe because they want the lockdown to continue

502
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:13,020
I'm not endorsing the vaccine Trump got Pfizer and others to actually put out a real

503
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:19,140
Attenuated version of the virus not an mrna vaccine that changes your DNA. That's even worse

504
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,140
To again take control the fear get people not to be in fear to have a solution

505
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:29,820
This vaccine that was created by Pfizer was not done because Trump wanted to undercut Bill Gates and all that shit

506
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:34,460
That's silly and the Gates Foundation has given vaccine related grants to Pfizer in the course

507
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,980
Of course, they have a good working relationship

508
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:41,820
Actually also when the news about the vaccine broke Trump whined like a baby and claimed that the vaccine was withheld

509
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:46,900
So he wouldn't have a win during his term. They waited until after the election to bring out this news

510
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:52,380
It's kind of fucking stupid because he's still president until January. So it's still his term. Yeah nonsense

511
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:58,860
Yeah, Pfizer released a pretty scathing statement about how they don't care about politics and they're more concerned with the global emergency

512
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,640
What about it Trump thinks that the release of this vaccine is made to make him look bad

513
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,900
So I think that maybe he and Alex have different talking points on this one

514
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:13,540
Mm-hmm further Alex has no idea what he's talking about. The vaccine being announced by Pfizer is an MRNA vaccine

515
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:20,820
Of course this vaccine that Alex is claiming is the alternative to Gates as evil MRNA vaccine is the exact same type of fire

516
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:27,420
Vaccine he has literally no grasp of the subjects he's covering and he just makes this shit up as he goes along. It's embarrassing

517
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:32,300
I'm just more interested in what does he want? What do you mean? What do you want? You're oh, I

518
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:40,100
See Trump created this vaccine in order to control fear and they they don't want to give you the vaccine because they want the

519
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:44,580
Lockdowns to continue now. I don't want to give you the vaccine because I think vaccines are evil

520
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:50,380
But they are doing this to make Trump look. What do you positively want? What would you prefer happened?

521
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:57,820
No one vaccine ever and then what crush doctors, but then people would still blame Trump for them kill

522
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:04,420
Scientists. Okay. Well that actually does sound right devilry. It does sound right. It's witchcraft. It's witchcraft. All right

523
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,740
I forgot I should have started from the assumption that it's all witchcraft

524
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:12,460
Yeah, so Alex is mad cuz Cuomo doesn't want people taking this vaccine

525
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:17,100
I guess okay guys found it like a minute. I'm even asking

526
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,620
the clip of Cuomo

527
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:25,980
Saying oh don't take Trump's vaccine because they want the fear to keep going when you get their M RNA vaccine

528
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,980
That's like being shot by a BB gun

529
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:35,940
Versus being shot by a 12-gauge shotgun a double-lock buck. I'm not saying take the vaccine. I'm not saying take the regular Pfizer

530
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,220
attenuated where they microwave or radiate a coronavirus

531
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:45,100
And your body learns how to beat it. It could still cause an autoimmune problem. It could still be contaminated

532
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,340
It's still that liability protection. I still won't take over my dead body

533
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,220
See this is where it would help Alex to know what he's talking about

534
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:57,700
He's saying the governor Cuomo doesn't want people to take the Pfizer vaccine because what he really wants is for everyone to get his much

535
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,860
More dangerous and deadly mRNA vaccine that'll come out later

536
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,340
Thanks to Bill Gates the normal attenuated vaccine is bad

537
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:09,700
But Cuomo wants to hurt people more so he insists they wait until an mRNA one is ready great plan

538
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,700
That's a fun story to tell dum-dums

539
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,620
But it really doesn't make sense when you realize that the Pfizer vaccine is an mRNA vaccine

540
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:22,180
If you know that then Alex is just saying that Cuomo doesn't want you to take an mRNA vaccine because he wants you to wait

541
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,980
Until there's an mRNA vaccine ready. It's nonsensical

542
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:32,100
Alex needs to try harder because this is just embarrassingly sloppy. There's not even a conspiracy to unravel here

543
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:37,460
It's just an instance where he clearly is making up details about this Pfizer vaccine because he knows nothing about it

544
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:43,820
And it would severely hurt his ability to support Trump if he had to explain why Trump was trying to take credit for an mRNA

545
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,700
Vaccine something that he specifically and repeatedly has said is going to kill everyone

546
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:54,020
Yeah, this is the time for him to stand up and really be the leader that they need right now. Yeah

547
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:58,180
Yeah, also, let's remember that this vaccine that's being touted by Pfizer

548
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,160
They're saying that it has a 90% success rate, but that's not been validated by peer-reviewed study yet

549
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,540
It's way too early to scream from the rooftops that this is the answer to the prayers

550
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:11,320
It's promising and I do hope that things continue to look good

551
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:17,040
It's kind of a sticky situation and someone like Cuomo is in an unfortunate position to have to be

552
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:22,320
You know the person who has something to say about this potential vaccine a leader

553
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,520
Yeah, it's not even available and he's already being called out for like not wanting to give it to people yet

554
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,520
You know sure

555
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,520
This is really just the way that anti-vax people flip the narrative when they know that they can't really argue the vaccine anymore

556
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,920
Their game of being staunchly opposed to any and all vaccine is great when there isn't an actual vaccine candidate

557
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:48,960
Once there is they know that opposing the release and distribution of the vaccine is tantamount to them saying that they support the continuing

558
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,440
Deaths of thousands each week from COVID-19. It's really hard to defend that one in a conversation

559
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,640
Yeah, and most of them particularly the ones who are media grifters know that they can't be successful

560
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,800
Trying to publicly argue that position and it will hurt their bottom line

561
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:11,320
Mm-hmm, so you see what someone like Alex does he lies about how this vaccine from Pfizer is one of the less dangerous ones and

562
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
Pretends that there's a conspiracy against Trump

563
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,880
Among anyone who would say like hey, maybe it's premature to widely release this one still need some more tests on it

564
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,440
It's all garbled. It's garbled. It's nonsensical because the point isn't the point. Yeah

565
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,480
Yeah, you you you if you think that there's something about this

566
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:36,420
That's like the vaccine is actually relevant to the argument that's happening. Mm-hmm. That's why you get confused exactly

567
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,920
That's yeah, that's the issue

568
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:45,220
Yeah, it's just a bunch of shit spinning around in the fucking toilet as it spirals down into our collective sadness

569
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,760
Yeah, that's a poetic way to put it. Did you read that in Assassin's Creed Valhalla?

570
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,680
So we're done with the night, okay, his show is not good

571
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:03,680
It's it's it is what it is. Not nearly enough caravan. That's the only thing I'm interested in totally exactly

572
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:10,120
So we get into now the videos that Owen has released. Okay for the caravan. Excellent on front

573
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
I'm sorry on the 9th on

574
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:19,480
November 9th Owen sits down and he breaks down what the the trip is gonna look like God here is the itinerary

575
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:25,280
I can't wait. This is a map and on this map. You're gonna see little roadways. Oh see beautiful

576
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,780
Okay, so we are launching the stop the steel

577
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:35,900
Caravan and it is going to be launching from Austin, Texas right here tonight at 5 p.m

578
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:41,340
And what we're going to do is we're going to drive right down here into Houston

579
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,500
But we're going to have our first stop tonight at 8 p.m

580
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:50,580
Then we got a long drive ahead of us and we're going to go all the way here through Louisiana

581
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:54,820
We may make a stop maybe in Lafayette or something link up with some people through Mississippi

582
00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:01,500
All the way through here down to Florida into Tallahassee. This is where we will be on Tuesday evening

583
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:07,940
First of all, this is a severe schedule. Yeah, Alex said they were gonna go slow. You heard that

584
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,420
He said they're gonna go slow. This is brutal

585
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:16,900
They're talking about getting from Austin to Tallahassee and basically a day's time if they're leaving Austin at 5 p.m

586
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,580
They should have no problem getting to Houston by 8. It's about a two and a half hour drive

587
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:24,820
So I would guess that shouldn't be an issue. Yeah, the next leg of the trip is a concern

588
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:30,060
Owen seems to be a little loose on the details, but according to his itinerary, which they've posted online

589
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,860
They're set to be in Baton Rouge, Louisiana by 11 a.m. On Tuesday

590
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:39,660
It's good that they didn't choose New Orleans since that would have been an extra hour to add on to the drive

591
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,660
But still this is a four hour drive

592
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:47,460
Assuming that they get to Houston on time, then they have a rally. Are they gonna stay the night in Houston?

593
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:52,260
They could probably pull that off. So let's say that they have a two-hour rally then go to bed

594
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:57,580
Get up and get on the road by 7 then they could make it to Baton Rouge by 11

595
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:04,100
Sure, then they gotta have a Louisiana rally and then get to Tallahassee by 8 p.m. For another rally

596
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,100
That's an approximately 7 hour drive

597
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:13,060
So if they're giving themselves two hours in Baton Rouge for the rally and everything that they're doing it could work out

598
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:19,060
But that's fucking tight. That is tight. It's almost like they're expecting everything to either be nothing or

599
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:24,620
That everyone will plan things for them. Yeah ready to go ahead of time when they get there

600
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,660
It's it's sloppy from a production standpoint

601
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,700
Anything goes wrong anything anything goes wrong their entire trip is behind

602
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:38,700
But compounded but does it matter? No, of course not if they get to

603
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:44,740
Tallahassee at 9. Yeah, no care. So no it the stakes are low

604
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,660
But also the setup is terrible true true true true

605
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,420
The next day is a little bit better paced on Wednesday

606
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:55,620
But this is a very very poorly timed route and it does not suggest that they had a lot of time to plan

607
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:59,300
So anyway, here's what happens on Wednesday then on Wednesday

608
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:06,660
We're gonna head north like this right up through here link up in Atlanta with some friends. That'll be on

609
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:13,540
Wednesday and then Thursday, we're gonna head up to North Carolina hit Charlotte head into Virginia

610
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,220
This is a little better spaced out

611
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:22,120
The first stop of the day there on Wednesday is 3 p.m. In Atlanta, which is only four hours from Tallahassee

612
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:27,200
So that leg should be totally fine. The next stop of the rally is in Columbia, South Carolina at 8 p.m

613
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,340
That's another three hours on the road. So as long as they limit their stay in Atlanta to two hours

614
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:37,040
This should be possible. That seems like what they did. They gave themselves two hours. Yeah

615
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,060
Yeah, then on Thursday, they do not go to Charlotte

616
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,780
In fact, they don't go to Charlotte at all

617
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,260
The next step is Raleigh and then there's another three and a half hour

618
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:49,380
I'm sorry, that is another three and a half hours in the car, but that rally is at 3 p.m

619
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,020
So they should be able to make that one fine after that

620
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,940
It's on to Richmond, Virginia for an 8 p.m

621
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:59,460
Rally, which again should be no problem and then the next day is in DC so they can get there whenever they fucking want

622
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:06,380
Really, this is a horribly designed trip. That first day must have been brutal. Yeah, like I've been on the road

623
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:12,140
Yeah, yeah comedy shows totally it's stuff like when I was looking at that like whoa. No, yeah

624
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,140
Oh, no

625
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,620
No

626
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:18,780
I've been seven hours and like you're adding on time to get meals and to go to the bathroom and

627
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:24,580
Unexpected things just always happen. Yep. So it just seemed like I would not want I mean

628
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,460
I want to go along with this, but I wouldn't want to be the ones doing it

629
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:34,340
No, I wouldn't want to be like responsible for anything. No, and it was clearly planned in in about 45 minutes

630
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,340
I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't

631
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,680
Account for time zones and all of this shit. Oh

632
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:46,980
I didn't when I was planning out like how many hours apart they are. I didn't even think about that

633
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:55,180
Think we might find out if they did too. So Alex is there while Owen is giving his

634
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:59,940
His little like here's where we're going. Sure. Sure. And here's how that video ends quite abruptly

635
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:06,040
So, all right more coming there in pole wars.com. I want Troyer leads the attack the peaceful attack the peaceful attack peaceful

636
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,980
peaceful attack

637
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:16,120
Very important peaceful attack. What is that? Get the fuck out of here. It's the you talk love and punch

638
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:23,040
Yeah, so we're going to turn the other cheek right into their fucking faces

639
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,320
Mm-hmm. We get to 5 p.m. Uh, Owen Troyer goes down to the state capital course

640
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,040
He's got some Patriots there got ready to send him off in style

641
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,480
Alright, ladies and gentlemen, Owen Troyer here live

642
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,880
Owen Troyer here live which camera am I looking at? All right, Owen Troyer here live

643
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,820
We are at the Texas State Capitol building behind me. We've got a lot of great Patriots out here that are sending us off

644
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,980
We're gonna be heading to Houston tonight

645
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:55,420
Owen has a great group of Patriots. They're sending him off in Austin as you can clearly hear the exact

646
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:59,460
There was browsing cheers. Yeah in the background. Yeah, Jordan

647
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,420
I'd like you to guess how many people are there for Owen send-off and I will give you a clue

648
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,400
Okay, I do have an exact number you have an exact number. All right, so

649
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:14,980
If it's not an estimate, I think we're gonna go with 13 people it's 9 it's 9

650
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:22,100
And there are 9 people there and in their hometown at the send-off event for their cross-country barnstorming caravan

651
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:28,860
That's the type of thing that happens after a wedding night and you're being sent off by all the drunk people in the bleary-eyed morning

652
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,860
It's absolutely the saddest picture you can imagine and fuck do I admire?

653
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:38,300
I admire Owen's attempt to keep a stiff upper lip and pretend that this is a great turnout. He's doing great

654
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:45,620
I'm pretty sure that's everyone who is there too because when the live stream starts there's actually only six people behind Owen and they have

655
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:49,780
To corral the other three to get into the shot to make it look like there's more people there

656
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,180
People out of a Denny's

657
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,700
It's sad man, but it's amazing. It's my favorite genre of entertainment

658
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:02,060
This is like this I could watch this forever this kind of thing

659
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:07,000
Oh, it tried to stay brave in front of completely obvious sadness

660
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,320
It's just it's just it couldn't be more blackadder like it is just pure pure

661
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,280
Stupid. Mm-hmm. It's amazing. So here's uh, here's a little bit of Owen talking about where they're about to head off to

662
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,800
We'll be at Hermann Park

663
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,880
Miller Hill we want to try to be there by 8 p.m

664
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,200
We may be running a little late, but we should be there by 9 p.m. At the latest

665
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,600
It's your first leg of the man. You can't start late

666
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,680
You can't start late and especially with that in pretty simple way between Austin and Houston

667
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,760
You're not making up time as you go along. I mean if you're worried, yeah, if you're worried about that, that's bad

668
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,600
Yeah, that's not good

669
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,040
Also

670
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:47,440
It's fitting that they're having a rally in Hermann Park in Houston because that park is named for George Hermann who donated a bunch of

671
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,480
Land to the city, but also fought for the Confederacy. Sure. Sure. So it's kind of right where right where they would

672
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,020
Yeah, you'd think they'd be so we get to Owen talking about

673
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,500
You know this this seems like a comedy show guy like a promoter

674
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,740
Uh-huh, like maybe a local show sure a guy who booked you. Uh-huh, and there's no one there

675
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:11,940
Oh, that's Ellen has that vibe that's going on. We know that we'll be in Houston tonight tomorrow

676
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:17,640
We're gonna be going through hopefully we'll have a stop in Baton Rouge. We'll be in Tallahassee, Florida tomorrow night

677
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,940
There's gonna be a big turnout there. It's gonna be a big turnout in Tallahassee

678
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,980
I know there's wait until next week. Wait until next week. Oh, man. You should have been here

679
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:31,620
Yeah, there's an hour before you were here. Yeah thousands of people last week was packed man. Sorry, I don't know

680
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:35,780
I don't know what happened this week. Yeah, so Owen doesn't really have much to say

681
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,020
So he starts talking to people and here's here's the first fella

682
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:45,180
So we've got a lot of people out here. So I want to ask these people why it's so important

683
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:48,000
In fact, let's get Richard Reeves up here. Come here Richard. Come here

684
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,760
Okay, come here Richard

685
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:59,940
Richard Reeve is a info wars guest. Yeah. He is a old friend of Alex's. This is not someone high profile

686
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,540
This is maybe an employee high profile. Oh

687
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:08,900
Celebrity sending us off to him. They have a big media presence too. I'm surprised Joe isn't there

688
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:14,840
You know Rogan should be right there. He should be he's in Austin exactly. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Hmm Joe Joe

689
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:22,300
Well, you know look Rogan's not there that would have definitely given them quite a spotlight yes

690
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:27,820
They do have a lot of media there though. Sure. We have multiple news media out here

691
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:31,140
Of course, the local media will never show up ever but they you know

692
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,180
There could be a fire right outside their front door and they wouldn't report on it

693
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,420
So that's no big deal

694
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,380
but this is gonna get national attention as

695
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:42,960
Long as you make it important as long as you get excited as long as you realize that this is the final level

696
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,380
Well, I don't know if there's multiple media outlets

697
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:53,140
But I mean, I guess it depends on what you'd consider a media outlet extra extra 14 people exist in space

698
00:48:53,140 --> 00:49:00,620
Mm-hmm. There might be a blogger there. Yeah, Richard Reeve might have a website could you could say infowars is there?

699
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:04,380
I mean in a sense the internet is national. Yeah

700
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:09,540
So Owen's gonna leave. Yeah, the interviews are what they are. They're pretty boring

701
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:16,380
He's gonna leave but he gets interrupted. Hmm. We've got to get to Houston. So we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna take off from here

702
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,380
Are we still alive?

703
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:24,780
All right, yeah sure go ahead so what is it called when a radical feminist star

704
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,340
God, oh facial hair after protesting president Trump

705
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,620
impeach buzz

706
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,640
Didn't even get good laughs there from the that crowd

707
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:44,020
So this is a guy who got interviewed by Owen earlier who comes back up tell an anti-feminist joke

708
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,900
Yeah, yeah to to sad

709
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,380
response from the gathered

710
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:54,740
This kills this kills is my clan meetings. Wasn't everybody loving this

711
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:59,540
So now Owen just like I we had a we got that joke was good

712
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,380
Now again, we're gonna be driving we can't facilitate lodging and meals and everything

713
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:11,380
But if you just stay the course with us eventually on Friday, you'll land in DC with us and then Saturday's a big day

714
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,820
There's gonna be millions of Trump supporters

715
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:17,900
I think in DC to stop this deal. So are you guys ready to make history, huh?

716
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:21,360
Are we ready to make history and save this country? That's where we're about to do

717
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:27,420
So god bless the Patriots god bless America. God bless Donald Trump. God bless everybody that made it possible. Let's hit the road

718
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,420
We'll see you at the stop the steel caravan

719
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:40,180
Fucking William Wallace shit right there man Wow today we declare our

720
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,500
our

721
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,500
Independence Day

722
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:59,300
So based on that you would expect that this thing is going

723
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,500
awesome

724
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:10,020
Jump absolutely. So you might be surprised to find out on the way from Austin to Houston. Yeah. Yeah. Oh something goes wrong

725
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:13,460
Oh, it needs to call in to infowars to complain

726
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:20,980
So I had to come on here and do this update because we're having mass problems with

727
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:24,140
communication and this is because of the censorship now

728
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,480
We don't have to pontificate on the mass

729
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:34,280
So tech censorship that we're enduring but because of that we're not allowed to promote our events on mainstream news

730
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,740
They'll never talk about our events on TV news

731
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:42,380
We're not allowed to exist on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram or YouTube or any of that. So all we have is our platform

732
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,600
That's it. That's all we have

733
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:48,080
So I had to call in and interrupt your broadcast tonight because this is the only place I can promote

734
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:54,440
What we're doing the stop the steel caravan. I hate to risk sounding uncaring about Owens problems

735
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,400
But isn't he describing a challenge that they have to be aware of? Well in advance

736
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:08,640
Spanning half the nation and you need to get people to a very tightly timed series of events in various cities

737
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,000
Isn't coordination and messaging your number one concern you were gonna do a direct mail campaign

738
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,160
But we realize there's some issues there, too

739
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,920
I just refused to believe that Owen got out on the road and only then it hit him that he'd been banned from Twitter

740
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,140
So he can't tweet about their next stop and it turns out parlor. Isn't that great?

741
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:31,200
It's outstanding really Owens been out of studio on the road for like an hour and he's calling in complaining about not having a Twitter

742
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,080
Account, this is absurd. I love it. Mom. I'm running away

743
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,400
Did you notice mom? I don't have any money to get a bus ticket. Yeah

744
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,960
Yeah, so it turns out that I mean like they did know that they weren't on these social media sites

745
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:52,720
But they kind of over bet on parlor sure being good not a surprise and maybe it's not good

746
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:58,160
I guess parlor is becoming so popular right now that it's just being

747
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:05,280
Overwhelmed and over inundated with people on it and it's just failing miserably. I can't put out any updates on parlor

748
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,780
Quite frankly, it's extremely frustrating because that's what we were gonna use to promote this thing

749
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:14,380
But it looks like we're just gonna have to call in here and give people updates. And of course, we're banned everywhere else

750
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:19,860
So hopefully parlor can get its stuff together. Otherwise, I may have to try to get back on the gab

751
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:26,220
And try to promote and give updates via gab. Wait, wait, you're not on gab. Why aren't you on gab man?

752
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:32,460
Why aren't you on gab? Oh, I thought like a lano and did you do you realize the gab is too toxic and not fun

753
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:39,580
Dude, oh even you realize that I was on gab, but then I got hounded by all these fucking Nazis

754
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:46,460
Yeah, they keep calling me like a like a shill for Israel. Yeah. Yeah, huh? I don't like it when you get abused online

755
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:53,260
Has anybody ever noticed that there's a lot of abuse online. Hmm. Somebody should do something about that

756
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,340
Yeah, so you might go back to gab

757
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:59,340
I think they get their shit resolved and they still posted updates on parlor

758
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:03,740
So I tried to get an account with like fake information, but they need an actual phone number

759
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:08,020
Of course, and I'm like, I'm not I'm not giving my phone number. I don't know

760
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:13,740
I saw some updates and it looked like things were great. Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure so Owen Owen

761
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:20,260
the only thing he can do is plug on info wars and then Wednesday Atlanta

762
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:25,740
Greenville, South Carolina and then Thursday, Raleigh, North Carolina and Richmond, Virginia

763
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,820
And then of course Friday and Saturday in DC. So this is the latest now again

764
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:38,100
Owen has plugged a rally in Greenville, South Carolina. That's not on any of their caravan itinerary surprise rally. This is weird

765
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,140
What's also weird is in a video they posted on Monday

766
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:45,860
There's a map that says they have stops in Atlanta and Columbia, South Carolina on Wednesday

767
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:49,500
But then on Tuesday, they posted a map that omits the Columbia stop

768
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:54,500
It's very confusing with or without parlor problems and Owen saying Greenville isn't helping

769
00:54:54,500 --> 00:55:00,980
It kind of makes sense for the tour to go to Columbia though because that's the state capitol and the rest of these stops except

770
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:06,820
For Houston are all state capitals and it's obviously Columbia. He just keeps fucking up. He said Greenville said

771
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,180
Charleston on the last one

772
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:14,580
Part of me thinks that maybe that's just because all these rallies are really up in the air on a moment-to-moment basis

773
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:18,620
It could be you know, like oh it's on this map this time and then we got a phone call

774
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,220
It's like we can only get four people to go to the VFW

775
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:27,300
You still want to come and they're like, I don't think we should so now that Owen is called in to complain about how he

776
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:32,460
Can't promote things to Deanna Lorraine. It's now time to get his ass to Houston at this point

777
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:38,220
I was really needing some context some additional footage or information than just the infowars content and luckily

778
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:44,100
There actually was a self-styled journalist who had decided to come along and document their trip. Fuck. Yes

779
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,780
You genius now granted this person was an infowars fan god damn it

780
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:54,700
So the turn there's not much footage like it's still edited down videos, but it's something

781
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,420
Oh and because it's an infowars fan you end up with interviews like this

782
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,060
Feeling good and running on pure adrenaline

783
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:09,100
Faith in God and love zero fear and we're on a mission of divine

784
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,100
proportions

785
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,420
Show our support for our country

786
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:21,460
And we're here to make sure we'll never ever submit. We'll never submit to the communists

787
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:28,540
In case you're curious Wow, the guy you just heard is the same guy who told the anti-feminist joke during Owen's send-off wild

788
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:34,220
Anyway, this is from a channel called just another channel and the guy who runs it is a dude who's called into Alex's show

789
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:38,780
In the past I've forgotten his name, but he's a dude who you could basically call an infowars employee

790
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:41,280
Except they don't have to pay a contractor

791
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,620
He's got some videos from the tour that I was able to consult for context

792
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,820
From his video of the Austin send-off

793
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:52,460
I was able to see Owens video from another angle and it's just as depressing from any angle as it was from straight on

794
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:57,660
I'm not fully convinced that some of the people in the video weren't there explicitly with Owen

795
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:04,380
So saying they had an organic turnout of nine people might have been an exaggeration. Yeah. So anyway, this dude is

796
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:11,540
following their caravan this this guy from the just another channel boy and this weird dude who told the

797
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:18,900
Anti-feminist joke I had hates communists is he's also he might as well be our eyes in yeah our way in

798
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,580
Oh my god. I

799
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,660
Mean, I guess it just happened too fast

800
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:25,900
I feel like if they had actually planned this with like a tour manager and stuff

801
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,940
Somebody would have been able to pitch to like Vox or something like we're gonna embed with this whole thing

802
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:35,980
I would happen to like it. Yeah, I would do it. Yeah, of course if if there had been enough lead time

803
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:42,220
I might have risked blowing cover or whatever. Yeah, I'd be like guys just please I give me you know

804
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:49,180
I'm good at creating. Yeah, like I could write an amazing thing about going along the you know, I'd be fair

805
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:54,460
Yeah, yeah to to fair to fair to fair. Yeah, I might make Owen look fun

806
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:59,460
The Dapper Nazi Dan wrote the Dapper Nazi. Oh shit

807
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:03,460
Uh, yeah, so we're in Houston, uh-huh

808
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:11,820
we've got now two streams of information the info war stream and this other weird dude sure who's going along with him and

809
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:32,260
Here is Owens clip in Houston

810
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,860
So Owen has arrived in Houston and he says the turnout is bigger than expected

811
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:40,300
Things are a little bit more difficult to assess in terms of the turnout in Houston

812
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,940
But that's just because it's nighttime

813
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,500
There's no doubt that it's more people than were in Austin

814
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,500
But it still looks pretty thin low bar

815
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:52,700
If I had to guess the number I would feel fairly comfortable in the 100 to 150 territory

816
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:57,900
That's more than I would have it either if I was owned much much higher than that stretches my belief

817
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,140
Yeah

818
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:04,140
the just another channel video kind of cheats to make the turnout look a lot bigger by recording the walk from a parking lot to

819
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:09,940
Owens location in fast motion making it appear that all the people that they passed are there for Owen sure and because it's sort of

820
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:12,220
Shaking all over the place. I can't keep track of any

821
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:17,180
Yeah, I don't know if those people were there for Owen or not, but you know, it's a public park

822
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:21,480
Yeah, even if I give Owen the benefit of the doubt and go with the high estimate of the turnout

823
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,980
It's still an embarrassing failure for info wars

824
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:29,520
If they presented themselves as scrappy upstarts then a hundred people showing up to a rally is great

825
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:35,660
But that's not their brand Alex insists millions upon millions listen to him world leaders. Listen to him

826
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:41,000
They've swung domestic and international elections. He has a million-dollar high-tech studio

827
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,540
They should not be drawing this poorly

828
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:43,980
Yeah

829
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:50,220
If you're a talented but relatively unknown comic and you can draw a quarter of a house that is nothing to feel ashamed of

830
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:56,480
If you're a headliner who's been in the business for 26 years and you can't fill a room you should stop booking gigs

831
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:00,580
Yes, it looks bad. Yeah. Yeah, you're gonna wind up at the Comedy Shrine in Aurora

832
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:09,300
With me and me. Yeah, so Owen's got some good news to give this collection of Patriots in Houston

833
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:37,180
I know when I have some good news

834
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,900
To give an eager crowd I'm speaking to through a megaphone

835
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:44,960
I'm really quick to get distracted and to trump impressions and rambling about multiple cars in the caravan

836
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:51,660
It's so amazing how the instinct to pad for time and tease things out for no reason. That's not just like a show tactic

837
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:55,180
No, it's just the style. Yeah, it's in the info war style guide

838
01:00:55,180 --> 01:01:01,600
I that reminded me so much of do you remember have you ever seen the Kurt Russell speech in miracle?

839
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:08,380
That is exactly how motivating that was that Owen just taught not very that no, it's quite. Yes

840
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,860
Okay. Yes, incredibly motivating. Yeah

841
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:17,300
I have a working theory that if you work it in four wars for long enough you lose the ability to get to the fucking

842
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,820
point

843
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:21,060
You just can't you have to like something else

844
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:26,160
I would believe that Alex can truly infect you with something that you'd like can't get out

845
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:31,220
You know, like there's a serious virus that he can break into you the virus of bad habits. Yeah. Yeah

846
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:34,140
Yeah, so we get to the good news. Finally. Sure

847
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,680
Biden lost, Pennsylvania

848
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:57,620
That's a great thing to say to get a crowd to cheer for you. Yeah, I would say that every time

849
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:01,660
Yeah, you get a big cheer. It's not true, but you get a big cheer, you know

850
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,220
So the good news that Owen was teasing out is that Boa?

851
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:11,060
Biden had lost the electoral votes in Pennsylvania. This is not true nor was it true then so this is sad

852
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:16,640
I was curious what the deal was here and where this news was coming from and thankfully I didn't have to look far

853
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:21,420
Because a source is provided in the video from just another channel here again

854
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:25,900
Was that weird dude who told that anti-feminist joke who I've now learned is named Tom

855
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:30,560
Yeah, what's the news? It just broke. What's going on with those states?

856
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:35,960
I'm real clear politics announced that they took the electoral votes away from Pennsylvania and

857
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:40,900
That immediately takes him away from having the votes

858
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:46,180
Actually Trump is winning and he is

859
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:53,880
So this is got from real clear politics apparently, okay. So the issue here is that there's a confusion in terms

860
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:59,180
What these guys are presenting is that real clear politics is reporting that Pennsylvania has taken away

861
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:02,780
The electoral votes from Biden thus putting the election back into play

862
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,580
What they're actually claiming whether it's true or not

863
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:12,820
Is that real clear politics was withdrawing their projection that Biden had won Pennsylvania's electoral votes, which is a different thing

864
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:17,060
There's a bit of a misunderstanding going on here that was exacerbated by social media

865
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:23,020
And of course Rudy Giuliani Rudy tweeted out the real clear politics had taken away their prediction of Biden winning

866
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:27,060
Pennsylvania on November 9th, which is the news that all these people are responding to her

867
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:32,220
However in the real world real clear politics had never called a winner in Pennsylvania to begin with

868
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:39,060
Their president Tom Bevin tweeted out on November 9th quote. This is false. We never called Pennsylvania and nothing has changed

869
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:45,960
The idea here is to pretend that there's some media outlet in this case real clear politics

870
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:50,980
That is swung things away from Biden and towards Trump because this creates the illusion of momentum

871
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:56,460
With no tangible victories and no real hope to point to it's important for these assholes in the right-wing

872
01:03:56,740 --> 01:04:00,300
Propaganda sphere to create their own fuel and this is one of the ways they do that

873
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:05,100
Yeah, you can see how even when on the road when doing something that's supposed to be fun

874
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:11,020
Oh and can't help but spread false and misleading information. It's all these people are equipped to do. Yeah, that's a real bummer

875
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:14,180
Yeah, but I mean if you want to get a cheer, that's a great way to do it

876
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:18,120
It's like if you're a stand-up. Yeah, and you're like, let's give it up for the troops. Sure

877
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,320
Hey

878
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,320
White staff. Yeah

879
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,100
So around this point I started to get a little bit lost in flights of fancy

880
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:30,880
I felt like Tom had really given me an assist with that one since Owen didn't cite a source and yet I had no

881
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:38,100
Idea who Tom was I'm getting information from Tom. He was just a weirdo in this guy's videos clearly along for the long haul

882
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:45,000
Essentially he was doing exactly what I wish I was doing documenting this utter nonsense, except he believes all of it

883
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,080
I bet he's actually Zach. I bet he this is my deep-throat reveal

884
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:49,400
Okay

885
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,960
He's actually Zach from

886
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:56,560
Space Force if Tom was gonna be doing all these things that I wish I was doing I felt like I should get a better

887
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:01,980
Sense of who this guy is figure it out figure it out. Who is this guy that I find myself feeling jealous of?

888
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:07,960
Luckily the just another channel videos use his full name and I was easily able to find his YouTube channel

889
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:13,040
It turns out that Tom is basically an open mic stand-up comic and his bits are what they are

890
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:19,280
Having been through it and done hundreds and hundreds of open mics and lived through the process of trying to write and work on jokes

891
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,520
I really don't have an interest in shitting on comics who are on their path

892
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:26,560
I will say however that I don't expect a Netflix special anytime soon

893
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:30,480
Ah, I'm not gonna take up our time making fun of his dude stand-up

894
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:35,120
But I can't not mention this on October 29th of this year

895
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,200
He posted a video of himself doing stand-up as Shao Kahn from Mortal Kombat

896
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,400
That was like two weeks ago. He's on stage

897
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:49,520
And I'm using the term very generous. Yeah in a full costume. Uh-huh. And here is one of the bits

898
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:59,120
The COVID fatality rate is at 0.0001%

899
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:03,120
The Shao Kahn fatality rate is at 100%

900
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:07,120
You're good! You suck!

901
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,040
That's really not good. Nailed it. Nailed it. Landed it. That's not good

902
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,040
But I've seen so much worse

903
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:22,760
It's a lot of commitment to get a Shao Kahn costume. To get one Shao Kahn bit. No, I meant the costume. Yeah

904
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,840
No, that's what I'm saying. He got the whole costume for one Shao Kahn bit?

905
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:31,160
Oh, I mean like it's a longer video than just that joke. That's brutal. Yeah, I didn't watch all of it

906
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,640
There's only one Shao Kahn bit you can do and you did it

907
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:37,920
That was about where I was like, I don't care. You got the costume. Alright buddy

908
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:44,400
That is fun because I can see myself in a bar

909
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,800
Like the hidden shamrock or something

910
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:53,800
Drinking at the bar and it's like me and a couple other comic friends at an open mic

911
01:06:53,800 --> 01:07:00,000
And he comes up and Shao Kahn and we all turn and look at him and we're like, hmm and then turn back to our drink

912
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,560
Look, that's exactly what that guy is. Oh boy

913
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:11,120
Doing that, huh? Over committed. Alright, this is an open mic, but okay. Probably should have worked on the writing

914
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,440
Try pretending you have a Shao Kahn costume

915
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,360
Hey, what if I were Shao Kahn?

916
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,760
Now here's a brilliant joke

917
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,200
If you have a good joke, you don't need the costume. No, you don't need a costume

918
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:32,320
If you don't have a great joke, you do need a costume. Yeah, you got to sell it and this still is not good

919
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,680
Anyway, that's the guy who's along for the long haul

920
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:43,800
The shrine yeah, so here we're back to Owen and in Houston and

921
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:57,560
And he tells he tells them this to give them a real sense of meaning in what they're doing

922
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:19,720
Pennsylvania and they already would have called Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada for Biden

923
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,480
So you heard Alex

924
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:31,320
Claimed that like Trump fighting is because he saw them in Austin and now Owen is trying to give the audience that same

925
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:39,280
grandiosity, yeah, yeah, they're like you you this hundred people showing up at a park in Houston is the reason that the

926
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,560
globalists took

927
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:45,800
electoral votes in Pennsylvania away from Biden as these men

928
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:53,500
Later in their life shall sleep wondering what will become of me shamed that they were not here with us on this

929
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,840
St. Crispin's Day

930
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:13,840
So Owen predicted there's gonna be millions in DC. Good luck. They saw you come out here in Houston and they have the algorithms. They've already plugged in the AI. They know that there's about to be over a million Americans in DC this weekend.

931
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:37,840
And so guess what? The corrupt mayor of DC has tried to lock the city down. When? When? I got bad news. I got bad news, Mayor Bowser. We're plumbing in a million strong and you ain't gonna stop nothing.

932
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:47,840
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!

933
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:53,400
An unsurprisingly large percentage of Owen's speech in Houston is the crowd breaking into USA chants

934
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:58,400
Which honestly I thought were kind of satirical when I was younger, you know

935
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,000
I felt like a high number of the people who are doing USA chants were mocking

936
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,240
Yeah, like making fun of the people who would just stupidly yell USA

937
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:11,860
Isn't that, like, a long-standing trope of somebody inexplicably, like, crying,

938
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:13,860
U-S-A! U-S-A!

939
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,860
Yeah, I feel like they've reclaimed it.

940
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:16,860
Yeah, yeah.

941
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:18,860
All in all, this is a pretty uninspiring speech.

942
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:23,240
By about minute four, you can kind of tell that Owen doesn't really have much gas left in the tank.

943
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:29,240
Just trying to prompt chance and talking about very not true news from Pennsylvania, that's basically it.

944
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:34,240
Here's a little taste of him from about minute five, where it just seems like he's fallen back on, like,

945
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,240
eh, platitudes, whatever.

946
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:40,240
Many who we thought were allies will abandon us on this journey.

947
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:46,240
Many who we thought were allies will stab us in the back.

948
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,240
But that's okay.

949
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:54,240
Because we're all we need, we're all we got, and we're going to D.C. to let them know that we still run this country,

950
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:58,240
and it's time for politicians to hear us!

951
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,240
Yeah!

952
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,240
Woo!

953
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,240
Okay.

954
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:10,240
And I say unto you, Steve Bannon will deny the cox crow three times.

955
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:18,240
So at this point, the rally ends, and I start to realize, first of all, these turnouts, I mean, granted, they were the first two.

956
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,240
Sure.

957
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:22,240
They're not good. Houston was better. Still not good.

958
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,240
Could be better.

959
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:28,240
I realized that I had really overthought things when I was talking about their itinerary.

960
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:31,240
They do not need two hours in any of these seats.

961
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,240
No, they don't.

962
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,240
They're not doing anything.

963
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,240
Always just coming in and yelling at a bullhorn.

964
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,240
You guys, we can do this!

965
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,240
And next stop, alright, we're gonna get out of here!

966
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,240
You guys keep on fighting the good fighting stuff.

967
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:49,240
Yeah, I was thinking there was actually, like, you know, we're gonna coordinate, we're gonna meet up with some people.

968
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,240
Totally.

969
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,240
It's nothing.

970
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,240
Of course not.

971
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,240
It's just, ah, show up.

972
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:56,240
There's just another channel guy will go around and videotape some people.

973
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:57,240
Yeah.

974
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,240
There's another group that's following them called the Hippies for Trump.

975
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,240
Of course.

976
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:04,240
I don't know what the fuck is going on with these white dudes with dreadlocks.

977
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,240
It's not surprising. Not surprising.

978
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,240
Yeah, these seem pretty high.

979
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:13,240
Yeah, this sounds like it's a hastily slapped together publicity stunt, Dan, and I'm just starting to think that it might be.

980
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:16,240
And I love it.

981
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:24,240
So, Owen goes to bed, and we wake up, and again, I will never know if David Knight covered this on his show.

982
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:33,240
But we jump in now on the November 10th episode of the Alex Jones program, where he's bent out of shape about a globalist named Klaus Schwab.

983
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,240
Okay.

984
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:39,240
Coming up, globalist Klaus Schwab. World will, quote, never return to normal after COVID.

985
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:42,240
No more police, no more meat, no more travel.

986
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:45,240
You'll be lucky if you're alive. Wait till I read it.

987
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,240
And you're gonna enjoy it. You're gonna bow down. You love it.

988
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:52,240
Klaus Schwab is the head of the World Economic Forum, and he wrote a book earlier this year called The Great Reset.

989
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:59,240
Some of the ideas in it were further explored in that online presentation that we discussed on a past episode, so we don't need to get too deep into it now.

990
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:04,240
That's what we talked about on the video that I did with that dumb Catholic guy, yeah.

991
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:09,240
This book is not Schwab saying that you can't have meat anymore or any of that bullshit.

992
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:15,240
It's a complex examination of interconnected forces that have been disrupted or altered by the coronavirus,

993
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:20,240
and it attempts to find possible solutions, as well as guess at some trends that might be expected to be seen.

994
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

995
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:24,240
I just don't care about Alex's inability to read anymore.

996
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:28,240
He's someone who can't be trusted to get the point of a young adult sci-fi novel,

997
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:36,240
so it's really crucial to understand that when it comes to something like a book like this, he truly can't handle the material.

998
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:40,240
Yeah, he doesn't realize that his teacher was not actually an alien.

999
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:45,240
In the book, the teacher was an alien, but not all teachers were aliens. That wasn't the lesson.

1000
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,240
Don't give him goosebumps.

1001
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:51,240
When Schwab discusses how things are never going back to normal again,

1002
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:56,240
he's saying that the state that we were in in early 2020 is not a state that we're working to return to.

1003
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,240
We can't be, because that's impossible.

1004
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:02,240
The idea that we have some kind of quote-unquote normal isn't a real thing.

1005
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:08,240
And wherever we end up, that will be the result of decisions that we're making now,

1006
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:14,240
how we respond to the challenges of the pandemic, as well as various aspects of life that it affects.

1007
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:18,240
Honestly, from what I've read about the book, it seems like one of the largest points he has

1008
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:24,240
about how things will be different in the future is that there's going to be a trend away from globalization.

1009
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:30,240
The thinking is that one of the things that makes the virus response so difficult is that everything is interconnected,

1010
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:35,240
so it's very hard to slow things down in one area of life without affecting every other one,

1011
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:40,240
and this you would expect to lead towards a less-connected world,

1012
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:46,240
because it would give more, I don't know, ability to have one thing fall apart.

1013
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:53,240
Well, I think the one thing that conservatives have absolutely dominated as far as messaging goes

1014
01:14:53,240 --> 01:15:02,240
is this idea that it's even acceptable to talk about an older time as being normal or static.

1015
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:06,240
Like, at no point, like, oh, let's go back to when America was great or anything like that.

1016
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:11,240
The 1950s were great. It wasn't fine. It was constantly in flux then, and then it changed,

1017
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:15,240
and it's going to keep changing, and there's nothing you can do about it.

1018
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:19,240
That's just how it is. How can we even have a conversation where people are like,

1019
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:22,240
let's live like we did back then?

1020
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:27,240
Yeah, so you can take this guy saying we're never going back to quote-unquote normal,

1021
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:32,240
and Alex can pretend that that means that there's no police and meet and travel anymore.

1022
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:36,240
And what he really means is something that the future is unpredictable,

1023
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,240
and we have the ability to make better decisions now.

1024
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:43,240
Although this is terrible, what's happening right now, disruption,

1025
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:50,240
and there are occasions and opportunities for us to do things that are better.

1026
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:55,240
Dumb-dumbs. We're tired of saying I told you so. Listen to us before you do the dumb thing.

1027
01:15:55,240 --> 01:16:01,240
Again, I stress Alex Jones is unable or unwilling to wrestle with complex ideas.

1028
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:05,240
So what he does instead is that he takes his fantasies and bizarre notions,

1029
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:08,240
and then he presents them as researched, studied fact.

1030
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:12,240
He's dumb, but being dumb isn't something to shame someone for.

1031
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:15,240
It's that he makes his living through the weaponization of his ignorance,

1032
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:19,240
which is something that is just repulsive, and I cannot forgive.

1033
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:22,240
So in this next clip, Alex goes out to break really weirdly.

1034
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:25,240
And listen to this. Mic down for this, because I want you to pay attention.

1035
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:29,240
I am dead certain that he meant to plug, and I think you'll agree with me.

1036
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,240
This is absolutely supposed to be an ad pivot.

1037
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,240
We're going to go to break. Now, I know you're going to do something.

1038
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,240
We've got to stay on air now more than ever.

1039
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:39,240
I'd hope Trump could win, and we could hopefully turn the tide back quicker.

1040
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,240
But you know, Revelation, you know what's going to happen.

1041
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:44,240
But we've got to build and be faithful and wake up as many as possible,

1042
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:48,240
and it'll get so bad that even those that are delusional in the end will wake up

1043
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:51,240
when they're being forced to be euthanized, when their children are being taken,

1044
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:55,240
when half their neighbors are dead from the vaccine, and they'll just finally go,

1045
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:59,240
oh, what's – and by then, it'll be drone armies, robots, nerve gas,

1046
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,240
helicopters flying over, nerve gassing everybody, because they've got a mop-up plan.

1047
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:06,240
So they're going to hit us with different waves of bio-attack over the years,

1048
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:09,240
locking us down tighter each time.

1049
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,240
And then, by the time they hit us with the real weapons,

1050
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:15,240
we'll be so absolutely outnumbered, outgunned.

1051
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:18,240
But it won't matter, because humans are very strong when we start to fight back.

1052
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,240
And it's just going to be one hell of a savage war.

1053
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:24,240
My God, it's just going to be – most of the people on Earth will be dead at the end of this.

1054
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,240
Hope you all enjoy it.

1055
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:28,240
World government's coming to kill you and your family.

1056
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,240
And they are celebrating it with enjoyment.

1057
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:33,240
And all the little yuppies in Austin are dancing in the streets

1058
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,240
and running around screaming they love Satan.

1059
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,240
And they do.

1060
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:40,240
And so their God is going to hurt them so damn bad.

1061
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:43,240
All right, Paul Joseph Watson's coming up on the other side.

1062
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:46,240
Infowars.com. Spread those wings.

1063
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,240
One hundred percent.

1064
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:52,240
I'm certain that a couple points during that, he had meant to jump to an ad.

1065
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:53,240
Totally.

1066
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,240
And Alex was like, ah, fuck it, I'm going to ramble about everyone going to die.

1067
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:00,240
There were at least four times where I guarantee I was supposed to hear,

1068
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,240
and that's why we need your support.

1069
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:03,240
And that's why we need your support.

1070
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,240
That was supposed to be there.

1071
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:09,240
Yeah, and what further reinforces that is that as soon as he comes back from break,

1072
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:10,240
he does a plug.

1073
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,240
Yeah.

1074
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,240
I'm pretty sure that he was just like, ah, fuck, I blew it.

1075
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,240
Yeah.

1076
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,240
Anyway, Alex talks to Paul Joseph Watson, and I don't care.

1077
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:22,240
I only have this clip in because it demonstrates that this is the next day,

1078
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:27,240
and Alex still doesn't know that that Pfizer vaccine is a mRNA vaccine.

1079
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,240
Cuomo and Oliver saying don't take it, it's dangerous,

1080
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,240
because this is a classic vaccine.

1081
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,240
I'm not saying take it, but Trump did it, so if you want it,

1082
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,240
you're in fear to end the lockdown.

1083
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,240
It's the excuse to end the great reset.

1084
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,240
That's why Trump checkmated him.

1085
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,240
But they're saying, no, don't take it now.

1086
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:45,240
You've got to take Bill Gates's mRNA vaccine a hundred times more dangerous next year.

1087
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:48,240
So they're completely transparent now.

1088
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,240
Yeah.

1089
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:51,240
So I guess Paul Joseph Watson doesn't know the difference either.

1090
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,240
Who cares?

1091
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,240
Why would they look it up?

1092
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,240
Why would they look it up?

1093
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,240
Alex made it up on the spot.

1094
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,240
He was just guessing.

1095
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,240
There was a 50-50 chance maybe he was right.

1096
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,240
Sure.

1097
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,240
Why not ride with it?

1098
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:04,240
So in this next clip, Alex discusses lying to a woman that he saw in public about masks.

1099
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,240
That's a great idea.

1100
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,240
And then he proceeds to gaslight the shit out of her.

1101
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:08,240
Great.

1102
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:12,240
By the way, people are in such fear that I ran into a lady a few weeks ago that I know,

1103
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:15,240
nice lady, and she's been wearing a mask for months, and I said,

1104
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,240
are you always going to wear that?

1105
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:19,240
Because Bill Gates said he wants you to wear it for ten years.

1106
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:21,240
And she started crying.

1107
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,240
And she said, don't be mean to me.

1108
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:26,240
And I said, I'm just talking to you nicely.

1109
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:29,240
But people are so emotional about this.

1110
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:32,240
Man, you are an asshole.

1111
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:35,240
It's because everyone is so emotional.

1112
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:39,240
That's why everyone always says you're attacking me and then starts crying.

1113
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,240
It's because of them.

1114
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:44,240
It can't possibly be that every time it has something to do with me.

1115
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:49,240
In this sort of meant-to-be heroic story of Alex's, he seems like a giant prick.

1116
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,240
He's a dick.

1117
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,240
Yeah.

1118
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:54,240
So, speaking of people who suck, Roger Stone shows up.

1119
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,240
Sure.

1120
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:58,240
And I will say, I'm pretty sure he's drunk.

1121
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,240
I think he's day drunk.

1122
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,240
I hope so, yeah.

1123
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:02,240
He has a giant cigar.

1124
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:06,240
Halfway through the interview, he puts on a big pair of glasses, sunglasses inside.

1125
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,240
Yeah, no.

1126
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,240
He's slurring a bit.

1127
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,240
He's doing the whole thing.

1128
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,240
He's lost his job.

1129
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,240
He's not getting a new one from anybody.

1130
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,240
He's got his part and Trump's gonna lose.

1131
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,240
Might as well fucking enjoy the rest of his life, yeah.

1132
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,240
Roger Stone is a smart political operator.

1133
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:21,240
He says Trump still has a chance.

1134
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,240
We still have a chance to stop this steal.

1135
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,240
He joins us from Florida.

1136
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,240
Roger, thank you so much for taking time out.

1137
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,240
Go ahead, sir.

1138
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:31,240
So, he has his plan for how this could still work out.

1139
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,240
Uh-huh.

1140
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,240
He's doing operation.

1141
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,240
Hey, look.

1142
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,240
Biden hasn't won yet.

1143
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:38,240
And people who say that he has, right?

1144
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:41,240
They're similar to another group that's in denial about something.

1145
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,240
Okay, okay.

1146
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:49,240
And the deeper you dig, you know that not only do they like Holocaust deniers, despicable

1147
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:53,240
people, they kept insisting, no, no, there is no evidence of fraud.

1148
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:57,240
They trot out Romney and Bush like anybody's gonna be impressed with that.

1149
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:02,240
So, people who are not buying your arguments about election fraud are similar to Holocaust

1150
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,240
deniers, which are repulsive people.

1151
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,240
Tell Alex about that, because he seems to hang out with a bunch of them.

1152
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:11,240
There are a lot of people who deny the Holocaust, but they're denying it in a good way.

1153
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:12,240
Not like this election denial.

1154
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:18,240
I don't know if there's any single source of entertainment that I've viewed in my life

1155
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:22,240
that had more Holocaust deniers on it than in Four Wars.

1156
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,240
Cheers?

1157
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:28,240
I'm not sure about the percentage, but I would say if you exclude the History Channel,

1158
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,240
because they have all those documentaries.

1159
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,240
They're all Nazis out there.

1160
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1161
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,240
That's so them, though.

1162
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:37,240
Like, their language is always the fucking most disgusting they can possibly think.

1163
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,240
And it goes both ways, too.

1164
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:44,240
It's like Mitch McConnell would reference Martin Luther King Jr. in a speech about how

1165
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,240
he's unveiling a bill to bring back slavery.

1166
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,240
Like, that's how awful they really are.

1167
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,240
You're not wrong.

1168
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:56,240
So in this next clip, Roger kind of rewrites the party swap from the 60s.

1169
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:59,240
I don't think he's making a whole lot of sense.

1170
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:06,240
The South and the Deep South have been a bedrock of support for Christian conservative values.

1171
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:12,240
They used to be democratic in the old days until conservative Democrats saw the error

1172
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:20,240
of the left wing, now communist, infiltrated Democratic Party and their other corporate

1173
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,240
handlers.

1174
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:26,240
And they had already moved to Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, Donald Trump in droves.

1175
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:32,240
Also, you have a great southern military tradition here.

1176
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:36,240
It goes all the way back.

1177
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,240
We have a great southern military tradition.

1178
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:41,240
It goes all the way back to the beginning of the United States.

1179
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,240
We're huge military people here in the South.

1180
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:46,240
No idea why I'm bringing that up right now.

1181
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,240
Just tossing that out there.

1182
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:56,240
This is just indicative of that very standard sort of belief in the anti-communist wings

1183
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:04,240
of the right wing sphere, that is, these civil rights movements were really just communist

1184
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,240
nonsense.

1185
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:12,240
For Roger Stone, one of the people who helped create the southern strategy, built entirely

1186
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:17,240
on whipping people up about race, for him to be like, they saw the error of their ways.

1187
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,240
Fuck you, Roger Stone.

1188
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,240
So Roger, he has his plan.

1189
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:26,240
There's a narrow way to victory, and he hints that it has something to do with electors

1190
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,240
or something.

1191
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,240
Sure.

1192
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:33,240
I don't think patriots understand that the last chain in this process is the legislature

1193
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:42,240
certifying who the electors who will go to the electoral college are under the US constitutional

1194
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,240
system.

1195
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:51,240
But they are, in fact, they are who we're shooting for, if you understand.

1196
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,240
Yes, sir.

1197
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:55,240
Not interrupting, because I want you to get it all out.

1198
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,240
I mean, yes, the electors are-

1199
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,240
Eating a sandwich.

1200
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:59,240
Eating a sandwich.

1201
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:06,240
What his argument is, I think, is that we can use these legislatures to force electors

1202
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:09,240
that will vote for Trump, even when they're supposed to be pledged to Biden.

1203
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:11,240
They're faithless electors and all that stuff.

1204
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:14,240
I'm furiously disgusted with this.

1205
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:19,240
You cannot spend a year telling me that this is life or death and we're fighting the

1206
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:26,240
devil and then be like, well, if we can use the vagaries of the fucking constitution to

1207
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,240
trick our way into the presidency.

1208
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:29,240
No, no, no, no.

1209
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,240
You can't like then be like, no, no, no.

1210
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:34,240
Oh, you didn't read us his rights before he got elected president.

1211
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:39,240
And so now we're like, no, you don't get a 12 hour fucking Cinderella solution to

1212
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,240
this fucking problem, okay?

1213
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:42,240
Not when it's the devil.

1214
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:43,240
Yeah.

1215
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:49,240
So Roger, I will say there's reasons not to take him too seriously.

1216
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,240
Sure.

1217
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,240
And this is definitely one of them.

1218
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:58,240
You have a whole second level here where Sidney Powell and Tom Fitton have correctly talked

1219
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:11,240
about the hammer, a very invasives federal essentially surveillance abuse which had corrupted

1220
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:19,240
and been able to manipulate votes through a scorecard program that was specifically

1221
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:23,240
designed to work through the back doors of the state.

1222
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,240
Roger's on some Dennis Montgomery shit.

1223
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,240
He's on the hammer and scorecard stuff.

1224
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:31,240
I think the worst part of that is he's telling it like he half remembers what it's supposed

1225
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:32,240
to be about.

1226
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,240
I think he's fucked up.

1227
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:34,240
Yeah.

1228
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,240
And then he's just filling in the blanks where he doesn't remember this stuff.

1229
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,240
Like he doesn't know what it even is.

1230
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,240
I don't think he cares.

1231
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:40,240
He doesn't know that it's supposed to be.

1232
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,240
Yeah.

1233
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,240
Yeah.

1234
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,240
He's like, and then they change votes with it and it gets, it's invasives.

1235
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,240
It's an invasives thing.

1236
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:47,240
Yeah.

1237
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:51,240
So he's promoting the stop the steal stuff and it's like, you're involved.

1238
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,240
I know you're involved.

1239
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:54,240
It's the same name.

1240
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,240
It's you.

1241
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,240
It's a bunch of your associates.

1242
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:57,240
You own the domain.

1243
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,560
I don't know what's going on here.

1244
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,960
You're making some money off this somehow.

1245
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:00,960
I'm sure of it.

1246
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,960
Totally.

1247
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,520
Um, but anyway, this is my favorite.

1248
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,520
This is such good comedy.

1249
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,800
Uh, I could not have written this myself.

1250
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,800
Okay.

1251
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,320
The universe had to create this for me.

1252
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:12,400
Uh, this is Alex's last question for Roger.

1253
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,400
That's right.

1254
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,400
I have one more question.

1255
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,400
Roger.

1256
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:16,400
What does Trump need to do?

1257
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,400
Warning.

1258
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:21,440
If you're drowning in debt, you can't afford.

1259
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,160
I got one last question for you.

1260
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:24,160
What is Trump?

1261
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,160
I'm getting the light.

1262
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:26,160
I'm sorry.

1263
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:28,840
What does Trump need to do?

1264
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:29,840
Every time.

1265
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:34,080
Imagine that Alex, like, every time, imagine that what he's saying is true and that world

1266
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,880
leaders listen to his show.

1267
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:36,880
Yeah.

1268
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,560
Alex is talking to Roger Stone.

1269
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,560
Trump is watching.

1270
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,880
What's, what's the last thing I need to know?

1271
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:45,120
What does he have to call into the show to get the rest of it?

1272
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:48,560
And Alex is going to be taking a nap, so he's not going to be able to get through to him.

1273
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:51,340
That's why he always misses the part that he wants to hear.

1274
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:55,080
And Alex is just done with the show, so he's napping and Trump can't get him.

1275
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,080
Oh man.

1276
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,080
That's brutal.

1277
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,080
Yeah.

1278
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,080
So Roger's gone.

1279
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,080
Uh, and uh, if you, yeah.

1280
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,080
Jordan.

1281
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:02,080
Yes.

1282
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,080
I mean, you're not in a city where you could.

1283
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,080
That's true.

1284
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:08,080
If you were in one of the cities along the route or near the caravan, if you don't join,

1285
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,080
you're crazy.

1286
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,080
That's true.

1287
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,520
I was going to be in Tallahassee tonight about eight o'clock.

1288
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,520
That's the real rallying point.

1289
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:13,520
We're counting on folks.

1290
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,520
We went through Florida.

1291
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,600
You know, Florida loves liberty, gas up the car, drive up the next few days with us, stay

1292
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,000
in DC for this event.

1293
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,240
If you don't, you're crazy because this is all about visuals and it's all about going

1294
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,320
up there and it's all about standing for freedom.

1295
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,740
So we'll see you in DC separately.

1296
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:34,620
We are running the emergency sale.

1297
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:36,040
It's all about visuals.

1298
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:37,040
Sure.

1299
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,040
That's very clear.

1300
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:39,040
Yeah.

1301
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,040
We know.

1302
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,040
Yeah.

1303
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,920
So, uh, Owen is back on now and, uh, he'd like to give a little interview from the road.

1304
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:44,920
Sure.

1305
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,320
He's in a van, a moving van.

1306
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,320
Okay.

1307
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:52,280
Uh, he describes kind of what's going on and I'm like, I don't understand how this is any

1308
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,000
different than a coup.

1309
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,920
What you're describing is a coup.

1310
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:56,920
Okay.

1311
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:00,800
So you've had Donald Trump, the president of the United States declare he's won.

1312
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:05,480
You've now had essentially for all intensive purposes, Mike Pompeo, the secretary of defense

1313
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:11,420
state claim he's won and you have about 70 million Americans, I think millions of which

1314
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:15,680
could be in DC this weekend claiming Trump won.

1315
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:16,680
Right.

1316
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:22,560
So you have Trump declaring himself the winner of an election that, uh, the sort of consensus

1317
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:23,960
is that he didn't win.

1318
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:24,960
Sure.

1319
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:30,080
You have his secretary of state, uh, lackey saying, eh, he won.

1320
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,080
Right.

1321
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:35,100
And then you also have large groups of supporters who are very angry, right.

1322
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:38,760
Who are saying that he, none of that proves that he won.

1323
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:42,600
All of those things are exactly what you would expect in the case of like someone who lost

1324
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,520
claiming that they won.

1325
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,520
Right.

1326
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,520
Right.

1327
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:47,520
But.

1328
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,520
But.

1329
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:49,520
But.

1330
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,520
But.

1331
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:51,520
It's a sting operation.

1332
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:52,520
Hey.

1333
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:53,520
Come on.

1334
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:58,000
It might, it's the, it might be, it might not be, who knows, they've forgotten about

1335
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
that now.

1336
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,120
I mean, it's literally a group of people getting in the car, trying to grab more and more supporters

1337
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:12,280
in order to essentially put siege to the white house until they fucking take over the country.

1338
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,280
With bull horns.

1339
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,280
Yes.

1340
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,280
With bull horns.

1341
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,160
My favorite thing.

1342
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:21,600
I know that I said that, uh, that last clip with Roger, where it got cut off.

1343
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,600
Sure.

1344
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:23,600
Favorite thing.

1345
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,600
Sure.

1346
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,600
This is probably the finest moment.

1347
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,600
Maybe of this whole episode.

1348
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,600
Okay.

1349
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,600
It's possible.

1350
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,600
All right.

1351
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,120
So Owen is just complaining about voter fraud and what have you.

1352
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,120
And then this happens.

1353
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,400
We'll say, wait a second.

1354
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,400
This isn't right.

1355
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:39,560
They see them counting in Pennsylvania and.

1356
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:52,600
Well, we lost Owen decided to buy into a delicious, cheesy hamburger.

1357
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:56,400
By the way, I've never been into a hamburger.

1358
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:02,480
It tastes so good, but all this news has just been broken.

1359
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,520
What is this?

1360
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,520
This happens a lot.

1361
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:09,080
I mean, this happens a lot, but this is, I think the first time or maybe it's one of

1362
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:13,560
the few times that Alex has been forced to like, actually just be like, I was eating

1363
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:14,560
a cheeseburger.

1364
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,560
I'm sorry, guys.

1365
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:16,560
No, a cheesy hamburger.

1366
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:17,560
Thank you.

1367
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:18,560
Yeah.

1368
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:19,560
He would never eat a cheeseburger.

1369
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,920
He simply likes his hamburgers cheesy.

1370
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:22,920
Yeah.

1371
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:24,440
He's interviewing Owen.

1372
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:25,440
Feed goes out.

1373
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:26,440
Ah, shit.

1374
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:28,240
Ah, you caught me.

1375
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,240
Yup.

1376
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,240
I got to own up to it this time.

1377
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:31,240
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

1378
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:34,240
You know, big old cheeseburger, cheesy hamburger.

1379
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:38,440
But his defense for it is like, honestly, this is the best cheeseburger I've ever eaten.

1380
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:41,640
So frankly, I'm doing you guys a favor by eating this cheeseburger.

1381
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:42,640
Someone's got to do it.

1382
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:43,640
Somebody has to.

1383
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:44,640
It's too good.

1384
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:45,640
Yeah.

1385
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:46,640
So now Stuart Rhodes shows up.

1386
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,640
Oh, great.

1387
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:53,480
And he thinks that what needs to happen is that Trump's got to declassify everything.

1388
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:54,480
Ooh, that'd be fun.

1389
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:57,720
Well, I think he's on the verge of doing what I've been calling on President Trump to do

1390
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:01,920
for at least six months, which is to classify all the dirty secrets and throw them out in

1391
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:02,920
the street.

1392
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:05,680
That's why it's awesome to see Don Jr. saying that just the other day.

1393
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:07,360
He posted on Twitter, declassify everything.

1394
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

1395
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:09,360
I should have agreed.

1396
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,360
You've been beating the drum for months.

1397
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:15,280
Weaponize this scene before the election, declassify it, destroy Brennan as a foreign

1398
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:19,040
agent, destroy Hunter, destroy Biden now, and Trump notes this has only moved.

1399
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:22,560
And that's why they're now calling for a coup to remove Trump because he's finally moving

1400
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,560
towards victory.

1401
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:24,560
Continue.

1402
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:29,360
So I guess the idea is that what they now want is for Trump to prove all their conspiracies

1403
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:30,360
for them.

1404
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,360
Yeah.

1405
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,360
Which I'm sure he's going to do.

1406
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:38,080
I personally would love it if he just declassified all kinds of shit.

1407
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:42,660
That of all the things that he could do as a spite move on his way out of office, that's

1408
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:44,600
the one I'm most in favor of.

1409
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:51,520
As long as it wasn't like really very strategically targeted, like if it were like alien shit

1410
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,280
or whatever, you know, like just something that like...

1411
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:58,080
Start going down the hill, Kennedy, the whole thing.

1412
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,080
Yeah, absolutely.

1413
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:00,920
Let the chips fall where they may.

1414
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:04,080
Fidel Castro was actually a CIA agent the whole time.

1415
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,880
I want it all.

1416
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:07,680
The Roger Stone files.

1417
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:08,680
Exactly.

1418
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:10,920
That one's probably not coming out.

1419
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:15,480
So Stuart Rhodes says this, and I feel like I'll like it, but my only response to this

1420
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:16,920
is that's not cool.

1421
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:22,160
Is we have men already stationed outside DC as a nuclear option in case they attempt to

1422
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:25,560
remove the president illegally, we will step in and stop it.

1423
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:30,440
And we're going to be there to also help secure the coming rally this Saturday and your caravan

1424
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:31,440
coming in.

1425
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,320
So I've got good men on the ground already.

1426
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:34,320
We've been...

1427
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:38,400
Did a lead recon there last week and we're sorting out where we're going to be staging

1428
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,400
and we'll be there.

1429
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:44,040
We'll be inside DC, we'll also be on the outside of DC armed prepared to go in if the president

1430
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:45,040
calls us out.

1431
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,600
Stuart, can you not feel history happening right now?

1432
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,000
I mean, it's happening right now.

1433
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Hoo boy.

1434
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Yeah, that's not good.

1435
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,440
No, that's really fucked up.

1436
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,440
Yeah.

1437
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:56,560
I, Stuart Rhodes, leader of the Oath Keepers, have an army of armed men ready.

1438
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:57,560
Hoo boy.

1439
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:58,560
Yeah.

1440
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,680
I'm going to be honest, it sounds, uh, sounds real blustery.

1441
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:02,680
Yeah, a little bit.

1442
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:05,280
I'm going to go with he's cosplaying on this one.

1443
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:09,880
Yeah, most likely, but it's such a scary prospect.

1444
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:10,880
Yeah, totally.

1445
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:13,440
I still feel the need to take him a little seriously.

1446
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:19,760
Yeah, no, cos people, cosplayers with giant heavy swords, even if they're heavy, they

1447
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:20,760
can still hurt somebody.

1448
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:21,760
It makes me uncomfortable.

1449
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:22,760
Fair enough.

1450
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:23,760
They don't have guns.

1451
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:24,760
Guns are worse.

1452
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:25,760
These guys do have guns.

1453
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,000
They have guns and they're worse.

1454
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,920
So the thing that I think is really funny about this interview is that Owen earlier

1455
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:35,900
said that Bowser, Mayor Bowser, was trying to keep him out of DC, and apparently that

1456
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:39,280
was in reference to, like, COVID restrictions and stuff.

1457
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,160
Yeah, you have to quarantine maybe?

1458
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:42,160
Yeah, yeah.

1459
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:46,360
And in Stuart Rhodes' interviews, like, nah, we've had guys there a while, like, you know,

1460
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,360
I don't have to do shit.

1461
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:48,360
Okay, great.

1462
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,360
Great.

1463
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,360
So that got punctured.

1464
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:51,360
That entire narrative.

1465
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:52,360
I do appreciate that.

1466
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:53,360
Yeah.

1467
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:54,360
So now we're done with the 10th.

1468
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,520
The show itself, again, not very good.

1469
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:59,720
Alex's show is not satisfying in many ways.

1470
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,120
There's still little things that come up.

1471
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:04,960
Alex eating a cheeseburger, Roger Stone probably drunk doing an interview.

1472
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,320
Did he make a, when he was eating the cheeseburger and got caught, did he, like, make a face

1473
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,320
to the camera?

1474
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:11,200
Did he mug to the camera with, like, a little...

1475
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,760
Unfortunately, there isn't video of him eating the cheeseburger.

1476
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,080
Oh, that's so disappointing.

1477
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:20,200
But there is, um, just, like, it's Owen's shot, and then the camera goes out, and then

1478
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:24,560
a big Sony logo pops up.

1479
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:27,120
It's, uh, not great.

1480
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,760
The three-dimensional pipes.

1481
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:29,760
Yeah.

1482
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:34,600
So we pick up with Owen on the road, and he's on his way to Baton Rouge.

1483
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:35,600
Sure.

1484
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,800
And that means red stick in French.

1485
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:38,800
Okay.

1486
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,520
Uh, Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

1487
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:41,520
Owen arrives.

1488
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:42,520
Okay.

1489
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:46,780
All right, ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroyer here from Infowars.com.

1490
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:50,840
Stop the steel caravan in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

1491
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:56,200
This is our first stop of the day before we get to Tallahassee, Florida, this evening

1492
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:02,800
where we're expecting a bunch of people, and so I'm not sure where, uh, our people may

1493
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:07,220
be out here because there is no real parking lot for us to station, and they have kind

1494
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:12,880
of the Capitol grounds shut down, so we're gonna drive around a little bit and see if

1495
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:16,240
we've got a caravan that's looking to join us out here.

1496
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:19,600
Otherwise, we're gonna have to just pick a parking lot.

1497
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,240
Owen can't find his people, which is a bad sign.

1498
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:26,360
We didn't plan any of this.

1499
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:27,360
No.

1500
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,240
That's what he should be saying.

1501
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:34,480
These are things that all went wrong logistically because we were very confident that we had

1502
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:39,460
planned everything, but we realized just now, oh, that's right, we're very dumb.

1503
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:42,840
An important part of meetups is where.

1504
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,960
Where is the first question, usually, that you want to take care of.

1505
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:47,120
You can't text anyone.

1506
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,880
There's no Google Maps.

1507
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,160
Just we're in a parking lot.

1508
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:55,200
So Owen finds the folks, and I would say that his response is tepid.

1509
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,200
Hello, Baton Rouge.

1510
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:01,400
Info Wars is in the house!

1511
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:03,400
That's a solid clap.

1512
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:09,200
The globalists thought that they destroyed America, but we're not dead yet!

1513
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:13,560
From what I can tell, there was a turnout of about 25 in Baton Rouge for Owen's arrival.

1514
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:16,200
But only one of them had hands with which to clap?

1515
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:20,240
The other ones were holding like Gadsden flags and shit.

1516
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:23,920
Owen's speech and appearance in Baton Rouge is incredibly boring, so I checked in on the

1517
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,020
coverage on the Just Another Channel.

1518
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:27,020
It was useless, too.

1519
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:30,440
It was just that Tom guy doing a bad Cajun impression.

1520
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:33,160
Of course.

1521
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:39,760
I would say that this stop on the convoy was a waste of time for both us and Owen.

1522
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,000
It was a zero.

1523
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:47,400
But while he's there, Owen bangs the gong that is labeled Biden lost Pennsylvania.

1524
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:50,120
I think we've got enough court cases, enough wins coming.

1525
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:57,240
Did you see they already took Pennsylvania from Biden?

1526
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:01,720
This is probably not a good question to ask, because I'm sure that they feel this way all

1527
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:07,720
the time, but how dumb must Democrats feel when they celebrated that Biden won and now

1528
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:10,040
he didn't win?

1529
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,300
How dumb do you think they feel?

1530
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:12,300
But how dumb do they feel?

1531
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:13,300
They probably don't feel that dumb.

1532
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:15,360
They voted for him in the first place.

1533
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:19,600
So yeah, I'm not sure if they can really sense their dumbness there.

1534
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,600
They like their feelings.

1535
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,600
They like their feelings.

1536
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:28,480
You said this was a sting operation, and now you're telling me that I should feel dumb?

1537
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:32,320
Just a couple days ago, you reported that this election was a fake election, it was

1538
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,320
a sting.

1539
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:34,320
A huge scoop.

1540
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,320
Yeah.

1541
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:36,960
Strange how I feel stupid about that.

1542
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,240
I feel real dumb, Dan.

1543
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:42,800
So Owen talks to the people who are there, and one guy comes up and he says he has a

1544
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,120
good idea.

1545
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:48,480
We had a million people in DC and a million people all across this country getting up

1546
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:52,660
on freeways, putting the banners over it, having 10,000 people see that every hour.

1547
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:53,760
We don't need the media.

1548
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:54,860
We don't need social media.

1549
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:55,860
We can do this ourselves.

1550
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:57,260
This is a multi-front battle.

1551
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:00,800
If you're not going to DC, you pick a bridge, you get on it, you do it, you do it every

1552
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:01,880
day.

1553
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:02,880
That's what's got to be done.

1554
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,880
There you go.

1555
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:04,880
We are the media now.

1556
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:05,880
We are the media now.

1557
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,360
We are the media now.

1558
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:09,360
We are the media now.

1559
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:10,360
We've taken the bridges.

1560
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:11,360
Uh oh.

1561
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:12,360
Uh oh.

1562
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:13,360
They got the bridges.

1563
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:14,360
Wait until someone tells them about town criers.

1564
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:15,360
We're screwed.

1565
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:16,360
We're screwed.

1566
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:17,360
We're screwed.

1567
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:22,720
If they've got, can they put like little paper cups inside of the fence on bridges to kind

1568
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:24,280
of spell out a message to us?

1569
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:26,360
Wait for them to learn about pamphlets.

1570
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:28,360
Yeah.

1571
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:29,360
They're the media now.

1572
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:30,360
They got bridges.

1573
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:31,360
All right.

1574
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:32,360
So Alex is-

1575
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:33,360
I got a Shao Kahn joke for you.

1576
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,360
Oh boy.

1577
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:35,360
Okay.

1578
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:38,440
Let me see if I got, I can get this one right.

1579
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:39,840
Something something Goro.

1580
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,160
No, no, no.

1581
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:49,720
Biden's victory is brutal, but the turnout at these rallies is a brutality.

1582
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:50,960
As good as that other dude's.

1583
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:51,960
Yeah, exactly.

1584
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:52,960
Yeah.

1585
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:58,700
Owen is acting like he just had a bae-ballity.

1586
01:38:58,700 --> 01:38:59,700
That wasn't even a joke.

1587
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:00,700
No.

1588
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:01,700
This was a statement.

1589
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:07,560
Alex is there in spirit in this Baton Rouge rally and Owen asks the audience for a message

1590
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:09,480
to Alex.

1591
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:12,520
Just say something to Alex Jones, because I'll tell you, you know, I've worked with

1592
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:17,080
Alex for a long time and he's really tied into this thing.

1593
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:19,600
It's hard to even understand or comprehend how tied into it he is.

1594
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,520
I see the torment he goes through.

1595
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:26,900
So just give him a little word of encouragement as we see America through this final battle

1596
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:28,360
to save our Republic, guys.

1597
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:29,360
Just tell-

1598
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:37,600
The hippies for Trump loves Alex Jones.

1599
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:41,160
So those are the hippies for Trump who've been along for this whole tour.

1600
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:43,600
We prefer sound bites.

1601
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,640
Your words are going on too long.

1602
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:48,400
So here's here's another.

1603
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,280
This was a fun little message to Alex from the audience.

1604
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:56,160
We love you, Alex, we don't need to fact check you like Joe Rogan did.

1605
01:39:56,160 --> 01:40:03,280
You didn't even know you had the documents, you know?

1606
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:04,280
You are the John the Baptist of this movement.

1607
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:08,040
You were laughing over another guy saying you're the John the Baptist of this movement.

1608
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:09,040
Oh, no.

1609
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:10,040
Oh, boy.

1610
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:11,040
Oh, yeah.

1611
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:13,720
There's nothing funnier than we don't need to fact check you like Joe Rogan.

1612
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:15,080
We don't need to fact check you like Joe Rogan.

1613
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:18,240
Oh, such a harsh fact checker that Joe Rogan was.

1614
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:23,460
And that's kind of the problem with like doing it halfway is because then you have the appearance

1615
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:27,920
of Alex coming out of that unscathed and it's like, oh, well, Joe did his best.

1616
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:28,920
He did.

1617
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:33,720
He gave he threw everything against the wall and Alex stayed standing and that is a really

1618
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:37,520
bad optical thing to give Alex.

1619
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,960
Now, I hate to say this, but this next clip is probably going to piss you off.

1620
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:42,960
Sure.

1621
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,280
This is probably I mean, because you're a lib, you know, this is really probably going

1622
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,280
to be like...

1623
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,280
Is it another Shao Kahn joke?

1624
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:51,980
No, but it's going to be like, you're going to just the hair on the back of your neck

1625
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:52,980
is going to stand up.

1626
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:53,980
I'm going to punch my wall.

1627
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:54,980
Probably.

1628
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:55,980
Okay.

1629
01:40:55,980 --> 01:40:56,980
Absolutely.

1630
01:40:56,980 --> 01:40:57,980
All right, guys.

1631
01:40:57,980 --> 01:40:58,980
You want to upset some liberals that are watching this right now?

1632
01:40:58,980 --> 01:40:59,980
Oh, yeah.

1633
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:04,800
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

1634
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:11,080
So they recite the pledge and then attempt to anger the libs.

1635
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:16,400
Oh, guys, guys.

1636
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:20,200
It's funny when they don't actually know or meet any libs.

1637
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,200
Sure.

1638
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:26,200
This weird like created version of the libs is being like, oh, they're so terrified of

1639
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,200
the Pledge of Allegiance.

1640
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,880
They respond to the pledge like vampires do to garbage.

1641
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:30,880
Yeah.

1642
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:31,880
Is that what's going on?

1643
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:32,880
Who are you people?

1644
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:33,880
Yeah.

1645
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:38,120
We're like, they just can't get this like, we're just like you, man.

1646
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:40,120
Nobody's mad at the Pledge of Allegiance.

1647
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:41,640
It's just boring.

1648
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:45,440
Probably unsurprisingly, though, this does end in a prayer.

1649
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:51,840
We pray right now, God, we pray that you hear this prayer, that you raise up Donald Trump

1650
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,400
to continue to be our king, God.

1651
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,260
We're standing in unity right now.

1652
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:58,920
We come together in the name of Jesus Christ, God.

1653
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:02,440
Father, we pray that you come against all demonic attack.

1654
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:04,520
We're praying for Trump to remain king.

1655
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:05,520
Good.

1656
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:06,520
Good.

1657
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:07,520
Good stuff.

1658
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:08,520
Hi, this is me, God.

1659
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:12,000
I would choose someone who can stand better.

1660
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,880
So the turnout in Tallahassee, which is the next stop on the tour, it doesn't appear to

1661
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:21,280
be much better than the previous events, but again, it's nighttime, so it'd be pretty difficult

1662
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:23,120
to gauge the exact numbers.

1663
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:27,640
I would say that there, you know, it could be absolutely, I would be shocked if there

1664
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:30,000
were 200 people there.

1665
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,680
That is kind of the ceiling I would go to.

1666
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:37,220
It's a great turnout for an indie band, but it's a terrible turnout for Info Wars.

1667
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:40,880
Some of the individual closeup shots don't look too bad, but the people are packed in

1668
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:44,900
pretty close, and also, if you watch the video, you're going to notice something glaring,

1669
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:48,160
and that is that literally no one's wearing a mask.

1670
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:51,240
That's something that our friend Tom is actually pretty stoked about.

1671
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:53,240
This is Trump country here.

1672
01:42:53,240 --> 01:43:00,080
It's great to come to Florida, no mask mandate, none of that bullshit, it feels like freedom.

1673
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,080
It's a totally change of energy.

1674
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:07,120
You go into gas station, go into a restaurant, go into Walmart, nobody says nothing.

1675
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:08,120
That's right.

1676
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:11,880
Absolutely unrelated, Florida is the state with the third highest number of COVID-19

1677
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:13,880
cases and the fourth highest death count.

1678
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:19,220
It's like if Typhoid Mary was actually a political movement.

1679
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:23,320
If you're Owen, you could probably feel a little bit better about your arrival in Tallahassee,

1680
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:27,320
but not because it's amazing, but because the other events were so bad, they were so

1681
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:33,900
dismal, that this is kind of like, okay, you have some stuff you can work with here, it's

1682
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:40,400
still way less than it should be if all the other things about what you do, you say about

1683
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:43,040
what you do are accurate, but fine.

1684
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:44,040
I'm not too mad.

1685
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:47,660
It looked like people were having a good time in Tallahassee.

1686
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:54,160
So they go to bed and we wake up and November 11th comes along.

1687
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:56,080
And again, I don't know if David and I covered any of this.

1688
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:57,080
I'll never know.

1689
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:58,080
Okay, fair.

1690
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:01,800
We get to Alex's show and I was expecting like some big news from the road.

1691
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:02,800
Totally.

1692
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,200
David, we get something altogether different.

1693
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,900
And Steve Pacenik's coming on.

1694
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:07,900
Get the fuck out.

1695
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:10,280
He's the guy that said two weeks ago on the show, they were going to fire the Secretary

1696
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:12,940
of Defense and they have the CIA and others.

1697
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:14,480
Did you hear they all got fired?

1698
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,480
Steve is coming on.

1699
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:18,800
He said two days ago it was a STIG operation.

1700
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:23,520
I don't care what he said two weeks ago, maybe he got something right two days ago.

1701
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:26,920
He said this whole election was one big STIG operation.

1702
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:29,480
And David Knight said he's a CIA operator.

1703
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:30,480
You can't walk away from that.

1704
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,480
He was there to trap you.

1705
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,760
Why are you having him back on?

1706
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:36,200
Who are you people?

1707
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:37,400
Do you talk?

1708
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:39,040
This is outrageous.

1709
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,960
Send a text message from time to time.

1710
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,960
This is outrageous.

1711
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:42,960
I want to throw something.

1712
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:45,520
I thought for sure Steve would be on time out.

1713
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:46,520
Forever.

1714
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:47,520
Yeah.

1715
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:48,520
Turns out you can fuck over Owen.

1716
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:49,520
It's not that big of a deal.

1717
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:52,080
You can say anything on War Room because no one's watching.

1718
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:57,400
Yeah, I think it's such a small audience that there aren't really any stakes to it.

1719
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:02,040
And that's why David Knight can choose to have Steve on or not because he has a tiny

1720
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:03,040
audience to it.

1721
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,040
It doesn't matter.

1722
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:08,240
And he can shit all over Owen because who gives a shit anyways.

1723
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:13,920
So Alex gets caught up talking about how Black Lives Matter or Aunt Jemima, and it's pretty

1724
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:14,920
offensive.

1725
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:17,840
Well, well, you're not.

1726
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:21,660
So when you see Black Lives Matter and they all look like Aunt Jemima, they are folks,

1727
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:26,640
they are literally Marxist, Leninist, Satan worshipers who follow Mao Tse Tung and say

1728
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:31,020
they hate men's very existence and the only good man is a castrated man.

1729
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:35,800
And their main sacrament is no families, for black people especially, and that black men

1730
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:36,800
have their testicles removed.

1731
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:37,800
I'm not making it up.

1732
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:42,240
Because, see, they can't outright kill all the black men so they just cut their balls

1733
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:43,240
off.

1734
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:46,160
All right, when we get back, I'm going to break all of this down for you.

1735
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:47,160
He doesn't.

1736
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:48,160
He doesn't end up breaking.

1737
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:51,320
Was that something that the syrup was pro that we weren't aware of?

1738
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:52,320
I don't know.

1739
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:53,320
Okay.

1740
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:55,800
I think this is all just weird racism.

1741
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:56,800
Weird racism.

1742
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:58,580
Yeah, I think that's what's going on there.

1743
01:45:58,580 --> 01:46:05,640
So in this next clip, Alex, I gotta say, in terms of satire, he's not good at it.

1744
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:09,240
In terms of these set pieces that he does, not good.

1745
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:10,240
No.

1746
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:13,640
This is about as well done as a joke has ever been on his show.

1747
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:14,640
Wow.

1748
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:15,640
This is where he declares himself president.

1749
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:16,640
Is this a Shao Kahn joke?

1750
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:17,640
No.

1751
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:18,640
Oh.

1752
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:19,640
He declares himself president.

1753
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:20,640
Okay.

1754
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:21,640
And I think, I feel like this was all right.

1755
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:22,640
Okay.

1756
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:26,760
While you're really freaked out that you've seen Joe Biden announcing himself as the president-elect

1757
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:30,160
and having the nerve to put up a big sign behind him saying it, and the whole media

1758
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:32,980
and even Fox News announcing it, when under the law, it's a fraud.

1759
01:46:32,980 --> 01:46:37,000
But that's what these scammers are trying to do because their past hoaxes have failed.

1760
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:41,520
But I've got some good news for you.

1761
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:50,080
Ladies and gentlemen, the 46th president of the United States.

1762
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:51,080
That's right.

1763
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:54,120
Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.

1764
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:55,120
Thank you.

1765
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:56,120
Thank you.

1766
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:59,120
It's not Donald John Trump.

1767
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:00,120
He was a 44th president.

1768
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:04,840
God rest his name and the annals of history.

1769
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:07,880
It's not Joe Biden, the Chinese communist globalist agent.

1770
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:08,880
No.

1771
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,780
All you've got to do is be a media outlet and then announce that you are allowed to

1772
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:17,740
announce the winner and that no one else is.

1773
01:47:17,740 --> 01:47:22,740
And then you just announce whoever you want is the president-elect.

1774
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:27,280
And so you just have a dark blue background with the presidential seal on it and some

1775
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:28,280
white font.

1776
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:34,000
And you are the president-elect, 46th president of the United States, Alexander Emmerich Jones

1777
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,140
of Texas.

1778
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:40,680
Before you say anything, hearing that a second time, I take it back.

1779
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:41,680
That wasn't good.

1780
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:42,680
No.

1781
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:43,680
Went too long.

1782
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:44,680
Yup.

1783
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:45,680
Overexplained the joke.

1784
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:46,680
Totally.

1785
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:47,680
As usual.

1786
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:48,940
You know what I was remembering that made me think it was good?

1787
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:50,160
It was the lead-in.

1788
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:51,160
Yeah.

1789
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:52,160
The lead-in was all right.

1790
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:53,160
No.

1791
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:54,160
Because it was serious.

1792
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:56,160
And then it flipped to being a joke.

1793
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:58,240
The music cue was at the right time.

1794
01:47:58,240 --> 01:47:59,240
It was good.

1795
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:00,240
Yeah.

1796
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:03,200
That was what tricked me into forgetting that it went way too fucking long.

1797
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:11,400
The window dressing at the start kind of gives you a little, but, oh boy.

1798
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:16,600
That's such a terrible, like, okay, we've announced that I'm the president and you know

1799
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:21,060
that because I've simulated what a normal news outlet would look like.

1800
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:25,160
And you know that you can do this because there's a blue background and on top of the

1801
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:29,360
blue background there's a logo and in front of the logo there's a flag and in front of

1802
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:31,640
the flag there's an eagle.

1803
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:32,640
And oh, the music's ended.

1804
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,640
Are you guys like this joke?

1805
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:34,640
Yeah.

1806
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:35,640
The music's ended.

1807
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:36,680
Is this joke really working for you?

1808
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:38,240
This is SNL, right?

1809
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:39,240
Yeah.

1810
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:45,760
I would say that it's a rare day in Austin when the cues at InfoWars work and that might

1811
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:46,760
have blinded me.

1812
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:47,760
That's true.

1813
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:48,760
That's true.

1814
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:54,640
And it has some problems with the voter fraud and people not believing their stories.

1815
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:55,640
Sure.

1816
01:48:55,640 --> 01:49:02,080
They had all these whistleblowers come out from the USPS about post-dating ballots after

1817
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:07,080
the election saying that they were from before the election.

1818
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:12,540
My brother-in-law, who I wouldn't even say is right-wing or left-wing, he's more pragmatic,

1819
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:18,380
he was fighting mad the day after the election watching somebody postmark 50 of them or so,

1820
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:20,320
working with the post office.

1821
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:24,260
I don't care about Alex's dumb brother-in-law, however I do want to touch on this whistleblower

1822
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:27,120
from the USPS that Alex is referring to.

1823
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:32,720
This is the subject of Project Veritas's latest pile of shit video, a guy named Richard Hopkins.

1824
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:36,220
Hopkins claimed that he was instructed by his postmaster in Pennsylvania to backdate

1825
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:38,760
ballots that came in after the election.

1826
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:43,040
His testimony has been used by many in far more official avenues to claim there's solid

1827
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,040
evidence that illegal ballots were coming in.

1828
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:50,560
However, the Inspector General of the USPS spoke to Hopkins, and Hopkins told them that

1829
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:56,160
quote, the allegations were not true and he signed an affidavit recanting his claims.

1830
01:49:56,160 --> 01:50:01,160
Project Veritas started a GoFundMe and quickly raised over $130,000 for Hopkins, even though

1831
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:05,600
he's clearly making shit up to be used as the basis for right-wing, dictatorship-enabling

1832
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:06,840
propaganda.

1833
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:11,240
Of course, Veritas can claim that he was coerced into recanting his story and he said that

1834
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:12,240
he didn't.

1835
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:15,600
And then this could just be another one of those things that's totally believed by the

1836
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:20,040
dumb-dumb audience, but there's no real evidence at all, and the people involved are seemingly

1837
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:23,840
acting in ways that are exactly what you would do if you want to keep a grift going, but

1838
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:27,520
also want to cover your ass from legal exposure.

1839
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,520
Sad stuff all around.

1840
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:30,760
Hi, uh, Mr. Hopkins, come on in here.

1841
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:34,840
I just want to talk to you about voter fraud and the alleged abuse that you witnessed.

1842
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:35,840
I didn't say shit!

1843
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:37,000
Oh, why didn't you say shit?

1844
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:40,200
Is it because you could be hit with a federal crime perhaps?

1845
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:41,200
I'd like to recant.

1846
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:42,440
You'd like to recant that?

1847
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:45,000
Was that coercion or just you realizing there are consequences?

1848
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,960
I'd like to avoid all consequences, now flash forward to a little later, I didn't recant

1849
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:50,960
anything!

1850
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,440
I don't remember recanting anything, but I sound that way.

1851
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:53,840
Please give me my GoFundMe money.

1852
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:54,840
No kidding.

1853
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:55,840
Oh boy.

1854
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:58,800
I would not be surprised if that GoFundMe gets frozen.

1855
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:05,960
Anyway, Steve Pachannik comes in and he's there to complain about John Brennan.

1856
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:08,960
So where do you want to start, Dr. Steve Pachannik?

1857
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:13,440
Let's start with the fact, this is very unusual what I just heard Brennan do.

1858
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:17,920
I mean, it was one of the stupidest interviews he's ever done.

1859
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:21,040
Did he claim that the election was a sting?

1860
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:23,480
That's a pretty stupid interview.

1861
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:24,480
That's a dumb interview.

1862
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:27,240
I would feel real stupid if I gave an interview where I said that.

1863
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:28,920
No, he doesn't say that.

1864
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:33,440
He's, uh, Brennan was talking about how like, you got to get Trump out of there.

1865
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:38,120
Like he, he's a caged lion, basically, he's a cornered lion.

1866
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:42,120
You don't know what he's going to do during this lame duck period.

1867
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:47,960
So he was just sort of, uh, you know, it's close to anything that Alex says that is pretty

1868
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:48,960
close.

1869
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:52,200
You know, like in terms of the globalists are encouraging the 25th amendment.

1870
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:54,200
Yeah, John Brennan was.

1871
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:55,200
I am too.

1872
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:56,200
Yeah, absolutely.

1873
01:51:56,200 --> 01:52:01,820
That does not mean that there is a massive elaborate conspiracy to trick Trump into getting

1874
01:52:01,820 --> 01:52:02,960
hit with the 25th amendment.

1875
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:09,360
This was just a commentator saying on public television, uh, hey, uh, Trump's a fucked

1876
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:10,360
up dude.

1877
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:12,560
We've learned he's a fucked up dude.

1878
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:16,960
Hey guys, uh, I don't know if you've been alive for the past four years or if you have

1879
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:21,800
ever read any history, but you realize that wannabe dictators don't leave on their own

1880
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:22,800
accord, right?

1881
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:23,800
It generally does not happen.

1882
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:24,800
You have to remove them.

1883
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:30,280
It seems, uh, it seems like, you know, and, and like even assuming that everything goes

1884
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:35,140
fine in January, like there's a lot of damage that can be done before that.

1885
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:36,140
He's got to go.

1886
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:40,360
I'm not, I'm not saying that I a hundred percent agree with that just based on like how much

1887
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:45,160
more trouble that could cause and the fact that January is coming.

1888
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:48,960
Uh, but I understand, uh, Brennan's perspective.

1889
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,880
Like I don't, I don't know.

1890
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:54,560
Anyway, Steve is somebody who Alex says has been in the CIA.

1891
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,900
Uh, Steve would beg to differ.

1892
01:52:56,900 --> 01:53:03,220
Now although I was accused of being a shill for the CIA, I've never been in the CIA.

1893
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:04,220
Accused by whom?

1894
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:07,160
Uh, maybe an enforced employee named David Knight.

1895
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:08,160
Uh, yeah.

1896
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:10,600
So Alex has said many, many times that Steve was in the CIA.

1897
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:12,200
I guess Steve is not.

1898
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:16,120
If I were Alex and I were interviewing him, I'd be like, wait, you've told me that you

1899
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:19,440
were a lot for years.

1900
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:24,480
So Steve was on the war room with Owen on the fifth, I believe.

1901
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:28,680
And he said that the whole election was a sting, they watermark these ballots and it's

1902
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:29,800
all like, ha ha.

1903
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:31,540
They played into our hands.

1904
01:53:31,540 --> 01:53:35,720
Something that if you were to claim and would later discover was completely false, dumb

1905
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:39,340
information, it would haunt you for the rest of your career and you would never be able

1906
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:45,200
to get a job and let alone be some sort of presenter on the show again so soon.

1907
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:47,520
Well there's this technique called hand waving.

1908
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,920
Ooh, I like hand waving.

1909
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:51,080
Here's Steve's attempt at that.

1910
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:53,720
Trump is very much in control.

1911
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:55,360
This is what I said before.

1912
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:57,000
This is Sun Tzu.

1913
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:01,160
He's watching the game, manipulating it, and you don't see it.

1914
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:06,120
I told you we set it up, whether you believe in the watermarks and that, that's not relevant.

1915
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:07,120
It is.

1916
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:08,120
It is not relevant.

1917
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:09,120
It's very relevant.

1918
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:14,800
It is suddenly from, from we know where every single ballot on the planet is to it's not

1919
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:15,800
really important.

1920
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:17,800
Yeah, believe it or not.

1921
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:19,360
It's no big deal.

1922
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:20,360
Come on.

1923
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:21,360
I'm not a CIA guy.

1924
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:23,240
It's a minor detail.

1925
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,240
It's one of those things.

1926
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:30,440
Whether or not this election was a set up operation, minor detail, minor detail, whatever.

1927
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:32,960
What a fucking, what a dick.

1928
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:33,960
Pretty amazing.

1929
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:34,960
It's unfair.

1930
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:38,480
So Steve has a belief that Trump is going to win the electoral college.

1931
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:39,480
Sure.

1932
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:41,280
Tell people your, your, your, your weather forecast.

1933
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,280
Rain.

1934
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:47,960
What I said years ago on your show, we did a sting operation on Hillary Clinton.

1935
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:49,440
She didn't succeed.

1936
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:54,120
We allowing Biden to be president for 40 or 60 days.

1937
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:57,420
And it's over December 14th, it will be over.

1938
01:54:57,420 --> 01:55:00,400
The electoral college will declare that Trump won.

1939
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:07,400
Trump will come back in and this is a period of turbulence that would be expected in admitting

1940
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:10,320
he's getting ready with riot police to shoot looters.

1941
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:18,700
Well, Jesus, we got a pretty solid prediction there.

1942
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:19,700
We can check back on that.

1943
01:55:19,700 --> 01:55:20,700
December 14th, huh?

1944
01:55:20,700 --> 01:55:21,700
Yep.

1945
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:22,700
We'll see about that.

1946
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:23,700
Well, I will.

1947
01:55:23,700 --> 01:55:24,700
I do like that.

1948
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:25,700
I think they're very kind.

1949
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:27,880
I think that's like, is that their version of a make a wish?

1950
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:30,640
Like we're going to let him be president for 40 to 60 days.

1951
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:32,620
We're going to give him that fun.

1952
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:36,020
And then obviously we're going to do a coup and have to kill him, but he's going to have

1953
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:37,440
a really good, nice time.

1954
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:41,900
So Steve's making some specific predictions and also hand-waving away the ludicrous nonsense

1955
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:42,900
that he said.

1956
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:46,800
If you think about the watermarks too hard, you're, it's a minor detail.

1957
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:51,940
Now I will say that this next clip, I've never agreed with him more.

1958
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:54,860
You know, remember we're an alternative media.

1959
01:55:54,860 --> 01:55:58,480
There's no reason for anybody to believe me or believe you.

1960
01:55:58,480 --> 01:55:59,480
Totally agree.

1961
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:00,480
Totally.

1962
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:01,480
100%.

1963
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:02,480
Totally agree.

1964
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:03,480
Agree.

1965
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:04,480
There is no reason for anyone to believe you.

1966
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:05,480
I would argue.

1967
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:06,480
There are many reasons for the opposite.

1968
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:07,480
Yeah.

1969
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:11,720
I would say that in the, in the pro con column, you got zero pros.

1970
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:12,720
Yeah.

1971
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:17,900
The interview ends pretty uneventfully, which I was kind of disappointed by.

1972
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:26,160
And uh, I feel very confused, uh, betrayed, flummoxed, I can come up with more words if

1973
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:29,180
you like, but I don't have my thesaurus handy.

1974
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:33,940
Maybe that's a more fitting punishment for Steve is to take away his big swings.

1975
01:56:33,940 --> 01:56:39,820
Well, I mean, this is a pretty small swing except for him saying that, you know, like

1976
01:56:39,820 --> 01:56:41,980
we are allowing Biden to be, well sure, sure.

1977
01:56:41,980 --> 01:56:42,980
Yeah.

1978
01:56:42,980 --> 01:56:43,980
That's not an interesting swing.

1979
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:44,980
No, no, no.

1980
01:56:44,980 --> 01:56:45,980
Yeah.

1981
01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:47,860
It's very close to the boring middle of info wars.

1982
01:56:47,860 --> 01:56:48,860
Yeah.

1983
01:56:48,860 --> 01:56:49,860
Yeah.

1984
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:50,860
Yeah.

1985
01:56:50,860 --> 01:56:51,860
And I got kind of excited when this happened.

1986
01:56:51,860 --> 01:56:52,860
Steve, we really appreciate you.

1987
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:54,500
Thank you for all the time.

1988
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:55,500
Thank you.

1989
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:56,500
And God bless.

1990
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:57,500
You know what?

1991
01:56:57,500 --> 01:57:00,540
I just, I kind of did a false start there, a false ending.

1992
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:01,540
Come back.

1993
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:02,540
I got one more question for you.

1994
01:57:02,540 --> 01:57:03,540
Then phone calls.

1995
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:04,540
And then we got Jay Dyer taking over.

1996
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:08,780
I got a serious question because everybody's talking about election fraud and watermarks.

1997
01:57:08,780 --> 01:57:12,900
And I know those exist, the Secret Service 30 years ago had it in printer ink and I know

1998
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:13,900
all that stuff.

1999
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:14,900
So that's a real thing.

2000
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:15,900
I wanted to get your take on that.

2001
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:17,140
Try to have a Steve Pagenik.

2002
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:18,140
He does not.

2003
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:20,340
Bottom of the ninth, two outs.

2004
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:24,580
Is Steve Pagenik going to get one more chance to swing the bat, Dan?

2005
01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:25,580
He does not.

2006
01:57:25,580 --> 01:57:26,580
Oh, damn it.

2007
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:28,380
I thought he had one big swing left in him.

2008
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:31,820
He doesn't even really ask the question directly at all.

2009
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:35,100
They just want to talk about how great it is that Trump's firing people even though

2010
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:36,300
he just lost the election.

2011
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:37,300
Sure, sure, sure.

2012
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:41,740
Trump is just axing all these people at the Pentagon that are civilians and bringing in

2013
01:57:41,740 --> 01:57:43,760
all these war heroes right now.

2014
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:46,300
And again, I see the pucker factor in MSM.

2015
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:47,680
They are visibly scared.

2016
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:50,900
I've got videos of them learning that Trump's winning states are like cussing on air and

2017
01:57:50,900 --> 01:57:51,900
panicking.

2018
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:55,040
I mean, I just want to see more of this because it's our country.

2019
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:56,420
I don't like authoritarianism.

2020
01:57:56,420 --> 01:58:00,700
I don't like military doing domestic actions unless a military and a foreign power is attacking

2021
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:03,060
me that I want the military in there and I cheer it on.

2022
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:05,460
I mean, we didn't bring ourselves to this point.

2023
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:06,460
The globalists did.

2024
01:58:06,460 --> 01:58:08,100
I just smell their destruction.

2025
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:09,380
I smell blood right now.

2026
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:10,380
No.

2027
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:12,580
Well, you're a good bloodhound.

2028
01:58:12,580 --> 01:58:14,540
I mean, you're Sherlock Holmes in that way.

2029
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:16,180
I don't mean it facetiously.

2030
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:17,180
Holy shit.

2031
01:58:17,180 --> 01:58:18,180
Wow.

2032
01:58:18,180 --> 01:58:19,180
Yeah.

2033
01:58:19,180 --> 01:58:20,180
Wow, Stevie Peas.

2034
01:58:20,180 --> 01:58:21,180
That's our biggest swing of the night.

2035
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:22,780
No, this is.

2036
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:28,960
I will guarantee you my career and my future, Trump will be the next president of the United

2037
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:31,600
States for the next eight years.

2038
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:34,460
Not only four years, it will be eight years.

2039
01:58:34,460 --> 01:58:35,460
All right, Steve.

2040
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:36,460
All right.

2041
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:41,500
He hit a line drive single.

2042
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:47,980
He's guaranteed on his career that Trump will serve the next eight years.

2043
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:48,980
Great.

2044
01:58:48,980 --> 01:58:49,980
Cool.

2045
01:58:49,980 --> 01:58:50,980
Great.

2046
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:51,980
All right.

2047
01:58:51,980 --> 01:58:55,680
I'm not a fan of authoritarianism, but I do have a guest on who's saying that Trump is

2048
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:59,360
going to destroy term limits, so I just want you guys to know.

2049
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:00,900
And have lost this election.

2050
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:02,180
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2051
01:59:02,180 --> 01:59:03,180
Or something.

2052
01:59:03,180 --> 01:59:07,780
Anyway, this brings us to the end of our episode, and we'll pick things up on Monday with what

2053
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:09,060
happened in the evening.

2054
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:11,060
I gotta know.

2055
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:12,060
I gotta know.

2056
01:59:12,060 --> 01:59:15,460
We'll find out what happened in South Carolina, Atlanta.

2057
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:16,460
Yeah.

2058
01:59:16,460 --> 01:59:18,660
I guess North Carolina after that.

2059
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:19,660
Virginia.

2060
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:25,120
This is why we need somebody, like this needs to be documented 24 hours, because we've already

2061
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:31,180
seen so many stupid things that you know had very interesting and angry conversations.

2062
01:59:31,180 --> 01:59:33,700
I almost guarantee most of them didn't.

2063
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:35,300
I bet it was incredibly boring.

2064
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:36,300
Really?

2065
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:41,460
There's no way that they were like, oh, we can't do this rally here, and then they had

2066
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:42,980
a furious argument together?

2067
01:59:42,980 --> 01:59:46,220
No, I'm sure Owen would be like, okay, sir, and then, you know.

2068
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:47,220
That's fair.

2069
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:52,660
I would bet if you wired their car and you had the actual footage, it would just be hours

2070
01:59:52,660 --> 01:59:55,780
of them singing 99 bottles of beer on the wall.

2071
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:58,100
All right, who else has a Shao Kahn joke?

2072
01:59:58,100 --> 01:59:59,100
Who's up?

2073
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:01,500
Did you see Rand Paul's Twitter?

2074
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:02,500
Guh.

2075
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:03,500
Yeah.

2076
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:07,460
You know, no one can get in this bus.

2077
02:00:07,460 --> 02:00:09,620
It's Outworld.

2078
02:00:09,620 --> 02:00:11,180
That guy wasn't on the bus.

2079
02:00:11,180 --> 02:00:13,420
He was along with the other independent reporter.

2080
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:14,420
Oh, okay.

2081
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:15,420
All right, all right, okay.

2082
02:00:15,420 --> 02:00:16,420
But yeah.

2083
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:20,100
I'm excited to see what happens, because I do think that there's a tiny bit of momentum.

2084
02:00:20,100 --> 02:00:27,760
If you look at the Tallahassee turnout, it was definitely better, and I think that they

2085
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:32,300
do better at night, also, so I think they should learn their lesson from that.

2086
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:34,180
Don't do daytime rallies anymore.

2087
02:00:34,180 --> 02:00:36,260
People still work, I guess.

2088
02:00:36,260 --> 02:00:41,820
I'm excited to see if it keeps growing a little bit, although I hope it doesn't, I mean.

2089
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:42,820
That could be a...

2090
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:47,860
I've done too many tours where it's like, you have a couple first bad shows, and then

2091
02:00:47,860 --> 02:00:52,320
your third show, you're like, oh shit, there's 70 people there, this is a good turnout, everybody

2092
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:56,940
was great, we partied afterwards, this whole thing is turning around, and then your next

2093
02:00:56,940 --> 02:01:01,140
show, there's two people from fucking Finland, Dan, Finland!

2094
02:01:01,140 --> 02:01:02,140
They were from Finland!

2095
02:01:02,140 --> 02:01:05,280
How am I supposed to do shitty jokes to two people from Finland?

2096
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,340
Probably tough to find common points of awareness.

2097
02:01:07,340 --> 02:01:08,340
It wasn't good.

2098
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:09,340
It wasn't good.

2099
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:15,980
I don't know, I'm interested to see, I would like to, I don't know what I would like.

2100
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:18,460
I mean, I just want this to end without any violence or anything.

2101
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:19,460
Yeah, me too.

2102
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:22,180
That's really all that I'm particularly invested in.

2103
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:27,820
If this story ends up with this being a complete dud, and like, embarrassing, awful, that'll

2104
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:29,040
be pretty funny.

2105
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:33,680
If this ends up growing and growing to the point where they get to DC and there's a lot

2106
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:39,460
of people, and it still just is a rally, that's fine too, that's a story, that's an interesting

2107
02:01:39,460 --> 02:01:40,460
story.

2108
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:41,460
They had humble beginnings.

2109
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:42,460
They did!

2110
02:01:42,460 --> 02:01:44,460
A couple people in Austin.

2111
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:47,260
Almost make me believe that Owen's speeches did inspire people.

2112
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:48,260
No, certainly not.

2113
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:49,260
Very much not.

2114
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:51,620
Maybe other people's social media posts.

2115
02:01:51,620 --> 02:01:55,140
I, you know, I could see that as a story and I'd be fine with that too.

2116
02:01:55,140 --> 02:01:58,700
Oath keepers shooting some people is not the story that I want to see.

2117
02:01:58,700 --> 02:02:04,620
As long as we can avoid that, I think we can have a lot of fun with the Dan's Caravanity

2118
02:02:04,620 --> 02:02:05,620
Project.

2119
02:02:05,620 --> 02:02:06,780
Fairytale ending.

2120
02:02:06,780 --> 02:02:09,060
Fairytale ending, alright.

2121
02:02:09,060 --> 02:02:16,420
We have every policy wonk in DC show up and surround their rally, all of them holding

2122
02:02:16,420 --> 02:02:21,540
their phones, and when the rally is sad and everybody kind of slinks away, they all, I'm

2123
02:02:21,540 --> 02:02:27,980
sure, simultaneously press the button on their phones, and 200 phones scream out, whoa, just

2124
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:28,980
like that.

2125
02:02:28,980 --> 02:02:29,980
That's what I want.

2126
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:31,980
Or I'll play, I'm a policy wonk.

2127
02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:32,980
Yeah.

2128
02:02:32,980 --> 02:02:34,500
Do do do do do.

2129
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:37,180
Yeah, so I mean, we'll see what happens.

2130
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:42,700
I'm thrilled that we were able to do this, because this could not wait.

2131
02:02:42,700 --> 02:02:45,760
And there's just too much material for one episode.

2132
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:49,380
So I, you know, there was a part of me that thought like, hey, we could just leave it

2133
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:53,740
all for Monday, but then maybe we wouldn't have gotten that weird appearance from Roger

2134
02:02:53,740 --> 02:02:54,740
Stone.

2135
02:02:54,740 --> 02:02:55,740
Gotta get Roger on there.

2136
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:58,660
Steve Pajanik comes back and pretends, hey, it's no big deal, I said it was a stick.

2137
02:02:58,660 --> 02:02:59,660
Unfair.

2138
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:03,460
Unfair that that's how you can operate in the real world.

2139
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:05,540
But we will be back, Jordan.

2140
02:03:05,540 --> 02:03:06,540
Indeed we will.

2141
02:03:06,540 --> 02:03:07,540
Until then, we have a website.

2142
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:08,540
We do have a website, it's knowledgefight.com.

2143
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:09,540
Yep, we're on Twitter.

2144
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:12,100
We are on Twitter, it's at knowledgefight.net, go to bed, Jordan.

2145
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:13,100
Yes, we are on Facebook.

2146
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:18,460
Indeed we are, we'd like to download iTunes review, and if you could, please find a local

2147
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:23,020
charity or bail fund in your area to help out people doing God's work.

2148
02:03:23,020 --> 02:03:27,660
Yeah, we'll be back, but until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZXClark, I'm Daryl Rundis,

2149
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:30,420
I only do standup in a Shao Kahn outfit.

2150
02:03:30,420 --> 02:03:31,660
Or Goro.

2151
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:33,500
Or maybe Baraka.

2152
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:35,500
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

2153
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:40,580
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work.

2154
02:03:40,580 --> 02:03:51,340
I love you.
