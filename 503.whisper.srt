6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,080
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,680
saying we are the bad guys

I need, I need money

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,200
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,120
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,600

Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,760
I'm Jordan

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,760
We're couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,360
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,680
Oh indeed we are Dan

27
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,160
Jordan

28
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,760
Dan!

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,360
Jordan!

30
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:08,960
Quick question for you

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,440
What's up?

32
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,160
What's your bright spot today?

33
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,160
My bright spot today Jordan is very simple

34
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,160
Vinegar

35
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,920
Vinegar?

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,160
Yep

37
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,760
Just vinegar?

38
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,160
Yep

39
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,720
Moving on

40
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:15,920
Yep

41
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,680
End of podcast

42
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,760
I believe that this segment is called bright spots

43
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,320
not explain your bright spots

44
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,360
That's fair

45
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,000
I've been looking for salad dressing replacements

46
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm trying to eat a little bit better

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and I accidentally stumbled upon some interesting vinegars

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
like a strawberry rosÃ© vinegar

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,800
Interesting

50
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,000
And it's fantastic

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I will agree that is an interesting vinegar

52
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah

53
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Had that on a salad, had it on some chicken

54
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and now I've decided that I'm going to explore the wonderful world of vinegar

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah, why not?

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I didn't realize that there was such a diverse world of weird vinegar products

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I thought it was just vinegar

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Can you...

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah that makes sense though

60
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Vinegar isn't like ketchup, it's not just like a thing

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No, but there are also a bunch of different ketchups

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, but there's ketchup

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Right

65
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You know?

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Sure

67
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You know what I'm saying?

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Not really

69
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Okay, fair enough

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
There's champagne vinegar in the cabinet that I'm excited to break into

71
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I've not tried that yet

72
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And then what did I order?

73
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I ordered one online that's a chamomile tea vinegar

74
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm never not going to enjoy your willingness to put both feet in the pond

75
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
before you have any idea how deep it is

76
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The pond is full of vinegar

77
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I enjoy it, we'll see what happens

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's the vinegar week

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah

81
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What about you?

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We're going to do 500 vinegars this week

83
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No we're not

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And we'll get back to the seltzers here soon enough

85
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Sure, sure

86
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
My Bright Spot, Dan, is unfortunately also food related

87
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But it is also a gratitude towards our listeners related

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh that's nice

89
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I got that peanut butter for our 500th episode

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The fog, something in fog

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Fit in fog I think

92
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Fit in fog, yeah

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I keep saying Phineas in fog but I think that's a Nickelodeon or two

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's something else, that's Phineas and Ferb I think

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah something like that

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And it is excellent

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I bet

98
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It is spectacular

99
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's spec-tacular

100
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There we go, nicely done

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thanks

102
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No it's just that like, oh shit I forgot what it tastes like when it's made out of real things

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You know like when you eat Jif you're like this is borderline all sugar and fake peanut

104
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's pronounced gif

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah nicely done

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's probably a hacky joke

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No it's pronounced skippy I think

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh

109
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's what I say whenever people say it's Jif

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I mean what about like a lot of grocery stores they have the things where you just put the peanuts in and grind it up yourself

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Totally, yeah

112
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Do you ever fuck around with that?

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No, why would I want to work?

114
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why would I want to work?

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Alright

116
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I go to the grocery store because I don't have a peanut farm, not because I want to

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Talk to my boy Jim

118
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't want to moonlight as a peanut farm worker

119
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Talk to my buddy Jim

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Jimmy Carter

121
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's him

122
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You know the guy?

123
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I've heard of him

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay

125
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Well that's good, I'm glad you're enjoying that peanut butter

126
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes, thank you very much Bex

127
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So Jordan, today we are having a very exciting time here

128
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes

129
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It is time for the thrilling conclusion

130
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The dramatic conclusion

131
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
To Dan's Caravanity Project 2020

132
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now Dan, this is Caravanity Project 2020

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Alright, alright

134
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Today we're going to be talking about November 11th, the evening of Wednesday until

135
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Whenever

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This weekend's nonsense in DC

137
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So we'll see what happens as Owen Schroyer continues on his great big convoy down along

138
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh boy

139
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The south and up the eastern seaboard

140
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay, here we go

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And, yep

142
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So we'll get to that here in a minute, but before we do let's take a moment to say thank

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
you to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show

How's your 401k doing, bro?

182
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,880
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright?

183
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,440
Let's just get down to business.

184
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,520
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

185
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,440
Why you pimps so good?

186
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,080
My neck is freakishly large.

187
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,840
I declare info war on you.

188
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Thank you so much Kit and Laura out in Cincy.

189
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,200
Yes, thank you very much.

190
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,880
Thank you Bianca and thank you Evan.

191
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,440
Yes, thank you very much, all of you.

192
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,320
If you're out there listening and thinking, hey, I enjoy the show, I'd like to support

193
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,220
what these gents do, you can do that by going to our website, knowledgefights.com, clicking

194
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,360
the button that says support the show, we would appreciate it.

195
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
We would love it.

196
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,320
What you could do is you could dip a knife into a big old jar of generosity.

197
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Just dip a knife in there, pull out some crunchy, just creamy generosity, spread it all over

198
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,440
the bagel of a local charity or bail fund in your area.

199
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,320
And top it with some really weird vinegar.

200
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,080
Yeah, absolutely.

201
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,000
So Jordan, I have two out of context drops from today's show, so we'll do one now and

202
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,520
one in a little bit.

203
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,480
I, because I'm a Christian, cannot kill you just because you're stupid.

204
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
Fair enough.

205
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,480
Seems good.

206
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Let's see.

207
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,360
I support this prohibition on killing.

208
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,480
Now I'm going back through my Bible to see how many people were killed because they were

209
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,560
stupid and it's a lot, but I don't know if it was post-Christ.

210
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,800
And I don't know if it was specifically only because they were stupid.

211
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,880
Yeah, that's fair.

212
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,380
So Jordan, when we last left off on our previous episode, Owen Schroyer and his merry band

213
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,240
of Shao Kahn impersonators and hippies for Trump were about to roll into Atlanta, Georgia.

214
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,200
That was Wednesday the 11th.

215
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,920
Alex had just wrapped up his show where Steve Pachana came in to claim that whether or not

216
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,720
you believe the 2020 election was a massive sting operation planned in advance to catch

217
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,080
Democrats stealing votes, it's a small detail whether you believe that or not.

218
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,720
What is important is that Trump is going to win and then apparently he's going to get

219
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,040
a third term because these dudes love America.

220
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,160
One thing that's crucially important to understand as we continue exploring this caravan is that

221
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,440
at a certain point it stops being an Infowars caravan and it starts being Infowars within

222
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,280
the larger space.

223
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,120
I'm comfortable judging Owen and Infowars for their crowds in places like Tallahassee

224
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,280
and Baton Rouge because those are specifically Infowars caravan events, or at least appear

225
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,600
to be.

226
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,840
Once they reach Washington DC, they are now becoming part of something larger, which is

227
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,560
the combined work of a network of loosely affiliated grifters.

228
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,400
The plan for the weekend has been for everyone to show up in DC and form the Million Maga

229
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
March.

230
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,120
I call it Griftpocalypse.

231
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,400
It's fair.

232
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,600
This effort combines the Infowars caravan with Ali Alexander's Stop the Steal campaign,

233
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,120
as well as Brandon Straca's Walkaway nonsense and whatever the fuck Mike Cernovich is doing

234
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,240
these days.

235
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,720
Beyond that it's attracted the legions of Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, and members of many

236
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,640
right-wing gangs who are less interested in hogging the spotlight.

237
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,800
According to an article from Friday in USA Today, the only group that had a permit for

238
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,640
the event is a group called Women for America First.

239
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,300
Quote, Amy Kramer, chair for Women for America First, said her organization is not coordinating

240
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,120
with any of the other groups planning simultaneous events.

241
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,200
This is really interesting because according to a recent article in Mother Jones, Women

242
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:18,320
for America First were on one of the main websites for Stop the Steal, www.stolenelection.us.

243
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,400
Donations that people made to Stop the Steal through that website end up going to Women

244
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,000
for America First, and the site was used to promote rallies branded as Stop the Steal.

245
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Great, great.

246
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Anyway, it's a load of bullshit.

247
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Griftpocalypse it is.

248
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,440
Yeah, it's a load of bullshit to pretend these people aren't coordinating.

249
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,940
But that's not even an argument that's really worth having, I think.

250
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,840
The point is that the end result of these rallies will be the combined efforts of a

251
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,000
whole cadre of weirdos.

252
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,500
And so even if we get to the end of this and there is a big turnout in DC, we have to keep

253
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,480
our eyes on the ball and remember that had nothing to do with this stupid road trip.

254
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,960
No, not at all.

255
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Not at all.

256
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:04,720
It's because fucking evil Steve Bannon, Nick, furied us into the Avengers of Grifters.

257
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,760
More or less.

258
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
That's what happened.

259
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
So here's our second out of context drop.

260
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,120
We've never lived in more historical times.

261
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,320
This is one of the most historical points in history, except when Jesus Christ was walking

262
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
on the earth.

263
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
That was more important.

264
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Okay.

265
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
All right.

266
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Yikes.

267
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:27,080
Let's see if we can name other historical figures who have...

268
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
Can't do it.

269
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
None?

270
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
None.

271
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
Is just Jesus?

272
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Jesus right now.

273
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
Jesus now.

274
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Okay.

275
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,640
He's even saying that 1776 wasn't a big deal.

276
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,600
All right, but what about Genghis Khan when he died an entire empire?

277
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Small potatoes.

278
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Okay.

279
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Fair enough.

280
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Small potatoes.

281
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Fair enough.

282
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Do you see that march in D.C.?

283
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Fuck.

284
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,040
It looked exactly like hundreds of thousands of Mongols riding horseback with their amazing

285
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
bows.

286
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
That shit was nothing.

287
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
Yeah.

288
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
Oh, fair enough.

289
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
So the 11th November.

290
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
Sure.

291
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
Owen Troyer arrives in Atlanta.

292
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Owen Troyer here from Infowars.com.

293
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:14,720
We have just landed in Atlanta, Georgia, and we are on our way right now to the Capitol

294
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,720
building where we have Patriots, Trumps and Mortars, Infowarriors gathered as part of

295
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,160
the Stop the Steel caravan.

296
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,240
There was no reason for me to pull this clip.

297
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Nothing happens in it.

298
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,800
I only decided to start with this because the opening of the video in Atlanta is surreal.

299
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,580
You have Owen Troyer poking his little head out of the sunroof of the Infowars tank with

300
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,320
a handheld mic, talking about how they're heading to the Capitol while driving down

301
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,360
an empty street.

302
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,760
There's no reason for them to choose this presentation.

303
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,080
All it does is make the audio terrible, since even if Owen has a windscreen on his mic,

304
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,480
he's still using a regular microphone while hanging out of a moving vehicle.

305
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
It's just very bizarre.

306
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,240
No, it was really easy to understand what he was saying the whole time.

307
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
It was infuriating.

308
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,300
No, it was great.

309
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,800
This video's real bad.

310
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
No, no, no.

311
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
Pop out of there to empty us.

312
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Yeah.

313
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
That's what you want.

314
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Empty road.

315
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Yeah.

316
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
It's the Stop the Steel caravan, and right now it is very successful.

317
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:14,280
It looks like we may stop the steel, but we've got to take this thing right to Washington,

318
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,280
D.C.

319
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,560
There's one thing that's suspicious in its absence from this shot of Owen hanging out

320
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,240
the top of the tank, and that's any indication that there are any cars behind him.

321
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,720
You would think that if the caravan is as successful as Owen is claiming, they'd pan

322
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,520
around to show the giant convoy, but nope, just Owen talking to no one, driving down

323
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
an empty street.

324
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
That's a great metaphor.

325
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,140
You know that I'm Mr. Caravan Fan, Mr. Caravan, if you will, but I found it incredibly challenging

326
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,760
to jump back into this stuff, entirely because how poorly produced this Info Wars video is.

327
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,120
Owen doesn't arrive at the Atlanta rally until eight minutes into the video, and the entire

328
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,000
time up to that point is just him with his head out the sunroof repeatedly saying, Atlanta,

329
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,040
we're in you.

330
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:02,000
It sounds more like that after the end of a week at camp, they always have the slideshow

331
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,520
with the... There's always a clip of somebody being like, and that's why we love camp, and

332
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,240
when there's swelling music around it, everybody's like, yeah, that's great, but if it was just

333
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,760
him silent to emptiness, you'd be like, this is a bad camp.

334
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:23,600
If I went to that camp, I'd probably be into a well-made version of Memories from Camp.

335
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Sure.

336
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,240
I still wouldn't be into it if it was poorly made, and that's how I feel about this.

337
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,520
Even if I were into Info Wars and I thought Owen was cool, I'd still be like, guy's got

338
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
to do better than this.

339
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,760
This is eight minutes of Owen saying nothing, hanging out the roof of a tank.

340
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
This sucks.

341
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,640
It's like the worst version of Mission Impossible.

342
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
I don't understand.

343
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,920
They didn't need to keep it for time or anything.

344
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,560
There's no reason for this to be in there.

345
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,420
It's so distractingly bad.

346
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,420
It's just hubris.

347
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,520
I think it's just hubris.

348
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,460
They just think any idea is the best idea at the time.

349
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,560
Their attention span is nothing.

350
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,700
Well, I would argue that it's more likely that they think that there's something badass

351
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:07,280
about him driving around out the sunroof, and I would argue it does not look that badass.

352
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,280
No.

353
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,880
It kind of looks just like, I mean, it looks fun-ish.

354
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Eh.

355
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,040
You got wind in your hair.

356
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,280
Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters one time.

357
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
It was great.

358
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Sure.

359
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
I don't know.

360
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,160
It made this a chore.

361
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,160
So on his way, I mean, whether or not he's badass or not, leaning out the roof of this

362
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:34,300
here tank, he does end up at a stoplight, and there's a guy at the stoplight.

363
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:41,760
There's something so fucked up and, like, immediately deflating about a tank at a stoplight.

364
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
It's pretty sad.

365
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,800
How dare you be stopped by light?

366
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,400
You're a fucking tank.

367
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Leading a convoy.

368
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Yeah, that's weak shit.

369
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
No.

370
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Get the fuck out of here.

371
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,520
Well, he obeys traffic laws, and he tries to do a little bit of, just do a little crowd

372
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,920
work with the guy who's standing, waiting to cross the street.

373
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,080
And so that's our plan, and that's why we're in Atlanta here today.

374
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,080
How are you doing, sir?

375
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,080
Me too.

376
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
Me too.

377
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Atlanta.

378
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
Atlanta.

379
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
We are here.

380
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
Stop.

381
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:20,560
The steel caravan has arrived.

382
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,480
Hey, how far out are we?

383
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,920
Less than a mile.

384
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,480
They are out of gas.

385
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,440
There is no enthusiasm left in this fucking thing at all.

386
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,600
I am trying really hard to stay excited about this, and they're not doing it.

387
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
They're bored.

388
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Yes.

389
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,160
They realized a couple of days in it was a terrible idea.

390
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
Yes.

391
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
They're not having fun.

392
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
We went to Baton Rouge.

393
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,000
We drove seven fucking hours, and there were ten people there.

394
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What are we doing?

395
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There's nobody there.

396
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Sucks.

397
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh, man.

398
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So Owen thinks-

399
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,200
See, this is when you want to be on the RV.

400
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Yes.

401
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,640
This is when you want to be getting the conversations and bird's eye view just right there.

402
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,680
Beautiful.

403
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,200
So Owen thinks he's funny, and so he has a bit that he wants to do.

404
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,640
And this is like, I mean, I guess this is exactly how comedians do it.

405
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,360
You polish things up at open mics before you try it on a real crowd.

406
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

407
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
No, no, that makes sense.

408
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,960
And for Owen, the open mic is sticking his head out the top of a car while no one's listening.

409
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Oh, that's fair.

410
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,960
I think the Democrats are actually still voting, guys.

411
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,760
Are the Democrats still voting in Georgia, or have they stopped yet?

412
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Do we know?

413
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,240
I think they're still voting, because Biden's not ahead yet.

414
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,440
So there's no one there.

415
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Wow.

416
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
He's just talking to nobody.

417
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
Brutal.

418
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
See-

419
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
Now, hold on, hold on.

420
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,440
This is a Shao Kahn joke, sir.

421
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,680
Well, maybe your mood will change once you hear the crowd within the background.

422
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,680
Try this on an actual audience.

423
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
Here we go.

424
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,680
I think the Democrats are still voting, guys.

425
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
I think the Democrats are still voting in Georgia.

426
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,680
They haven't stopped voting yet, because Joe Biden hasn't been put in the lead.

427
00:16:52,680 --> 00:17:05,680
So they're going to keep voting here in Georgia until Joe Biden gets the lead, but I don't

428
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,680
think it's going to work.

429
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,160
Good stuff.

430
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,920
But I don't think it's going to work.

431
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
Good tag.

432
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
All right.

433
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
Good work, guys.

434
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,880
So, you know, that sound wasn't that great, but I can't throw too much shade at the turnout

435
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,320
at the Atlanta rally.

436
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,720
It's still south of 200 people, but that's really good for an Infowars event that's taking

437
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
place during the day.

438
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
Yeah, that's not bad.

439
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,440
So far, their daytime rallies have been very, very sad, and this at least looks like what

440
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,200
you might call a group of people.

441
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,160
There were some strange signs in the crowd.

442
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,320
One was just a big queue with the where we go one, we go all slogan.

443
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,460
Another was, quote, Trump's coup d'etat is already underway, which kind of implies that

444
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,080
Trump is leading an overthrow of the government.

445
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,480
I really don't think they get how that sounds.

446
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,080
That seems to either be a counter protester or the opposite of what the messaging is supposed

447
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
to be.

448
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,280
I don't know what's going on.

449
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,120
Overall, I would give this Atlanta rally a solid meh.

450
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,460
Decent turnout when we grade on a curve, but full of suspect weirdos and nothing really

451
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,880
interesting at all.

452
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,080
It kind of feels like this was an event that might have been planned already and Owen just

453
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,840
crashed it, since there's definitely some people there who seem to be confused by his

454
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,840
arrival.

455
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
Sure.

456
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,800
The video on Infowars is titled, quote, Democrats send operatives to start violence at rally

457
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,520
in Atlanta, which I don't see in the video itself, and even if there were violence in

458
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,360
the video, their claim that they were operatives sent in by anyone is completely manufactured

459
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,240
and not substantiated in any way.

460
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,120
I think the title is in reference to a young woman who drives by and yells that Trump isn't

461
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,960
president anymore, which is the closest I could see.

462
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Just scary stuff.

463
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Yeah.

464
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,560
At a certain point, another guy with a bullhorn threatens Owen's dominance with a we don't

465
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,720
want pedo Joe chant, but it all resolves peacefully.

466
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Oh, that's good.

467
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Yeah.

468
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
That's good.

469
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
I would hate to see infighting at these.

470
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,840
I imagine they're Democratic operatives.

471
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,520
That's gotta be somebody in the movie who's like, they're green, it's their first operation

472
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
in the field.

473
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,440
You know, they've been on the desk for a few years.

474
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,400
Everybody else got injured, so now it's their chance to shine, and they're like, we're sending

475
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,880
you to a rally with 200 people to cause problems.

476
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,600
Uh, oh no.

477
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,020
We're gonna go send you to Agent Provocateur, something that needs no Agent Provocateurs

478
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,520
to get out of control.

479
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,840
Can I try and solve terrorism or something?

480
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
Next time.

481
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,840
All right.

482
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,200
So the video from just another channel also doesn't really show any violence.

483
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,920
There's a little bit of yelling between a few people at one point, but it's unclear

484
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,120
what the context is, and then there's a long segment where the video maker and his friend

485
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,880
Tom, who's now our friend Tom, complain about how someone is flipping them off from a nearby

486
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,280
window.

487
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
It's pretty sad.

488
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,320
What is wrong with these people?

489
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
It's very bummerly.

490
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,240
Oh, I love triggering the lip.

491
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,840
He's giving me the finger!

492
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,880
And they're just like making heart shapes with their hands, and the guy's like fuck.

493
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Fuck you.

494
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,160
So the Atlanta rally was at 3pm, and unlike past stops, this one included what appeared

495
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,200
to be a little bit of an actual march.

496
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,480
I have no idea where they were going or why they were parading, but it seemed like a new

497
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,280
development compared to previous cities.

498
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,360
I don't think they did either, Dan.

499
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,640
From there, Owen was off, because he had to arrive in Columbia, South Carolina for an

500
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
8pm rally.

501
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Sure, sure.

502
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,640
Infowars only posted a one minute video about South Carolina, which seems weird, because

503
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,160
from the just another channel footage, it seems like that would be the most useful for

504
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
them optically.

505
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Sure.

506
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,780
It was nighttime, the turnout was pretty good, and there were some college students yelling

507
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,520
at them, creating the sort of tension and victimhood they desire in their optics.

508
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:35,800
Operatives go to college, spend $40,000 to $60,000, and then they're undercover enough

509
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,280
to shout obscenities, yeah.

510
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,940
In the video on Infowars, we get a shot of the caravan itself, and it's really hard to

511
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,800
tell how many of these cars are actually along with them, or if it's just traffic.

512
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,560
Assuming that all these cars are part of the convoy, it's like maybe 10 to 15 cars, which

513
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,960
is nothing to sneeze at if you're an indie band or something, but it's really sad for

514
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,760
day three when you're Infowars.

515
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,360
Yeah, that's not good.

516
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,920
That's not a convoy.

517
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Turnout was alright in Columbia, South Carolina, but again, it's easy to overestimate because

518
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,260
it was nighttime.

519
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,320
They ended up taking a big group picture in front of the Capitol building, and I think

520
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,120
it's about 150 people, probably.

521
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,320
Sure, sure, that's nice.

522
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Yeah.

523
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
Good for them.

524
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,960
In the evening of the 11th, things took a turn for the ugly, as the Infowars caravan

525
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
came under attack.

526
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
Uh oh.

527
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,600
We have a video posted on Parler, trucks were throwing milkshakes at the convoy, and here

528
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
is the report.

529
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Well, here we are on the Infowars caravan still.

530
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
I think we're like 20 cars strong, 30 cars strong right now.

531
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
I'm in line with everybody.

532
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
I'm like five cars back behind the Infowars riot wagon, or armored vehicle, whatever you'd

533
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
like to call it.

534
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:52,520
I actually just had a trucker throw something at me, and it exploded all over my truck,

535
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,160
some sort of nasty milkshake or something.

536
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
A nasty milkshake.

537
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,720
There was a young girl driving in a Pontiac, and she cut the trucker off, and he started

538
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,600
flashing her, and threw something at her, and it hit me.

539
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,320
So I'm getting attacked because other people in the caravan aren't driving well.

540
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:17,840
But yeah, I don't know, I've got a million miles, at least, traveling back and forth

541
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,000
across this country, and I've never had a trucker throw a milkshake at me.

542
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So that's definitely a new one.

543
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,840
Oh, that's nice.

544
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,640
This is rather interesting, but anyway, we're on our way to DC, and I'm going to have to

545
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,640
get a car wash at some point, and wash all that shit off my car.

546
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,320
You can actually see several of our guys up here ahead of us.

547
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,880
You don't get to use car washes.

548
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,840
Driving this caravan stuff is pretty crazy, because people are slowing, and then speeding

549
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,160
up, and slowing, and then speeding up, and then people are trying to cut us off and doing

550
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
all kinds of crazy stuff.

551
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,160
No shit!

552
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,160
It's wild driving in caravan, guys.

553
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:05,840
I hope you're all staying safer than me, not getting any dramas.

554
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,040
People were pretty quick to point out that the reason for all the things this guy is

555
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,160
describing is because they were basically clogging the interstate.

556
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
Yeah.

557
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,320
They had 20 cars in a row in the passing lane, which is at best dumb and selfish, and at

558
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
worst pretty dangerous.

559
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
They did what?

560
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
They had it in the passing lane?

561
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,600
They were on the left side of the road.

562
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,160
As a Chicagoan, that upsets me more than what they stand for.

563
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,100
When you do a convoy like this, there's no reason that the cars all need to actually

564
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,440
travel down the highway in a line, but that's what they seemed insistent on doing, which

565
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
is stupid.

566
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
Of course.

567
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,700
Plus, they were doing this convoy at night for no reason.

568
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,680
This was the leg between Columbia, South Carolina, and Raleigh, North Carolina, which is about

569
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:50,800
three and a half hours drive, and the North Carolina rally was at 3 p.m. on Thursday.

570
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,520
There's no reason to night drive that one in a convoy 20 cars deep.

571
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,240
That's just asshole behavior.

572
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,720
Oh, God.

573
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,200
Luckily, everyone survived.

574
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,880
You don't get to use a car wash.

575
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,340
You're a rugged individualist.

576
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,560
You have to find a fucking hose.

577
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,600
You don't get to use all of these creature comforts if you're trying to sell yourself

578
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,320
as the fucking revolutionary that you are.

579
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
I would like to...

580
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,800
Sheik Ravara didn't fucking wash his shit in a fucking washing machine.

581
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,600
I'd like to shift your criticism.

582
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,440
I don't care whether they use car washes or not.

583
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
Fine, I get that.

584
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,880
I would like to say you don't get to complain about someone throwing a milkshake at your

585
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
car.

586
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
That I agree with.

587
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
Grow up.

588
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,880
That I thoroughly agree with.

589
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
Yeah.

590
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,160
So yeah, everyone survived, and now we jump in on the 12th on Alex Jones' show.

591
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
Because again, who knows?

592
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,120
David Knight might have had full coverage of the caravan, and it'll be a mystery lost

593
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,120
to time.

594
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,920
Much like, who built the pyramids?

595
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,400
Was it the aliens or was it Egyptians?

596
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
It was not the aliens.

597
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
We'll never know.

598
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,800
What if David Knight covered it back then?

599
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,600
Non-white people can also build things, turns out.

600
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,720
But what if the equivalent of David Knight covered ancient mysteries, and we'll just

601
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,440
never know because it was so boring.

602
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,440
Yeah, that's possible.

603
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
That's possible.

604
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,960
If you wanted to hide true information, you give it to David Knight and no one will ever

605
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,960
know.

606
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,480
If you want to have really fun, interesting, fake information, give it to him and it'll

607
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,960
bore the shit out of me, which is normally what happens.

608
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,640
So anyway, here is Alex attempting to make some analogies, and I apologize in advance

609
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,560
for the audio quality on this show.

610
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,600
They were saying, Alex, why are they having people that have moved out of California vote

611
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,320
for Biden when Biden was already going to win the state?

612
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,120
Well once you're already flipping everybody's votes and already stealing, you keep stealing

613
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
to stay in power.

614
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
Why?

615
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
That's why nobody can win as a Republican in California.

616
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
They already got it.

617
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,840
They already got it in California unless you had like an 80% victory because of the fraud.

618
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,040
That's why there was 87% turnout.

619
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:50,040
We never had anything near that in the US, usually 55, 60% because people went out to

620
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,520
vote against Donald Trump, Biden, and they just got cheated by the computer.

621
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,840
So that's coming up.

622
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,040
But again, people are like, well, why would they cheat in California if they've already

623
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
got it?

624
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,840
Because they already cheated.

625
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,240
It's like saying- You're a genius.

626
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,320
If you've remarried and your new wife's pregnant and you're like, well, why do you have an

627
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,320
18 year old son?

628
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,360
Well, I got another woman pregnant before.

629
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,480
There's no third dimensional thought here.

630
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,040
Why are they stealing stakes they already got?

631
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Because they already got them.

632
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
What?

633
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,880
I mean, let me use another example.

634
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
Yes, please.

635
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,440
Let's say I'm slaughtering cows.

636
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
Okay.

637
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
All right.

638
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,760
And I'm about to slaughter a new one to put it in my deep freeze.

639
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
Of course.

640
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,080
And people ask, well, why do you keep the other deep freeze going that's got some of

641
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
the last cow left in it?

642
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,080
It just doesn't even register.

643
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,960
See, once we start thinking third dimensionally, we can defeat the globalists because they're

644
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,480
operating third dimensional.

645
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,880
We can operate fourth, fifth dimension.

646
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Are they?

647
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,880
Many plays out.

648
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
And that's what we do here at Infowars.

649
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,720
I don't know if Trump plays 3D chess or 5D chess, but I know I do.

650
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,520
So I listened to Alex a bunch so I can help you out here because that was a garbled mess.

651
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
Sure.

652
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,520
Yeah, that was great.

653
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,840
I got the point really well.

654
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,840
Did you?

655
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,840
Yeah.

656
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Well, let's see if you did.

657
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
Okay.

658
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,920
Well, what I think is that Trump basically won almost every state, but there was fraud

659
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
all over the place.

660
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Sure.

661
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,960
There was even massive voter fraud in California, which people he talks to can't understand.

662
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,440
They don't understand why the globalists would steal votes in California when California

663
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,860
consistently votes Democrat.

664
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,680
Alex's explanation is that California doesn't actually consistently vote Democrat, and the

665
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,560
appearance that they do is only there because of the voting fraud that's already and always

666
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,240
going on there.

667
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,820
They were stealing votes in California because they're only in power in California due to

668
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,680
all the votes they always steal.

669
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,040
This is not that complicated of a concept that he's trying to describe, and yet Alex

670
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,320
struggles to come up with two really bad analogies.

671
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,920
The first is getting married and your new wife is pregnant, but you have an 18-year-old

672
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,240
child, which is from a previous marriage.

673
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,520
This analogy doesn't make sense because each pregnancy would be an unrelated event, whereas

674
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,340
the imaginary voting fraud would probably only be able to be pulled off by the people

675
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,000
in California because the people committing all the fraud are in power and covering it

676
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
up.

677
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,840
They're having kids because they've already always been having kids, Dan.

678
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,840
We'll get to that.

679
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,680
The previous fraud facilitates the current fraud in the California example.

680
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,320
The way to make this analogy actually work would be to imagine a scenario where the new

681
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,640
wife allows Alex to impregnate her because she's so impressed that he has an 18-year-old

682
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,640
son.

683
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,640
That would make sense.

684
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,120
Something about his son needs to implicate the current situation, and in the existing

685
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,420
analogy, that's not the case.

686
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,800
With the California stuff, the idea is that they're stealing the election because they

687
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
always do.

688
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,840
So it's possible that another way to make this analogy work is for Alex's response to

689
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,680
this person to be that his new wife is pregnant because he only gets romantically involved

690
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,160
with women, he's gotten pregnant.

691
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,160
Yeah, that would make sense.

692
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,240
Then the analogy would work.

693
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,240
That would make sense.

694
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,600
The second analogy Alex is trying is that he's slaughtering a cow while keeping what's

695
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,280
left of his previous cow in the deep freeze.

696
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,680
This also doesn't make sense based on what he's trying to say.

697
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,360
This would be a good analogy if he were trying to argue that Democrats kept deep frozen votes

698
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,360
from the last election to use in this one because they won by such a wide margin last

699
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,720
time so they had leftovers or something.

700
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,160
Are they reusable like that?

701
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,280
I mean, in terms of keeping cows in the deep freezer, that's how that might work.

702
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,160
I would put the votes in a plastic bag so they don't get wet.

703
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Smart.

704
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,400
Neither of these analogies help clarify his point, but Alex insists this is somehow third

705
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,440
dimensional thinking, whatever the fuck that means.

706
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,080
Really the only thing that these two analogies have in common is a sense of time that whoever

707
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,040
Alex is talking to seems unaware of.

708
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,400
The child from a previous marriage analogy involves a person who doesn't realize you

709
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,520
could have had a child with someone else in the past.

710
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,220
The cow butchering example involves a person who doesn't realize that the cow in the freezer

711
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,080
will eventually be eaten in the future.

712
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,880
The only thing I come away from this convinced of is that Alex is really bad at analogies,

713
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,760
and the people he talks to on a regular basis must have a difficulty with really elementary

714
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,680
concepts, maybe even object permanence.

715
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,600
Have we tested Alex on object permanence?

716
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,240
We tried to play peek-a-boo?

717
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,560
I would be interested to know exactly what extent his object permanence lasts to.

718
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,440
I assume it's more than peek-a-boo.

719
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
Okay.

720
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,440
But is it like six months?

721
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,760
If anybody who's involved with the Sandy Hook trial is listening, on the stand, test his

722
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,120
object permanence.

723
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,380
Here's what you do.

724
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:26,760
On the first day, hold up a sign, and then see if he remembers that there was a sign

725
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
in the room.

726
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,760
Anyway.

727
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
That would be fun.

728
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
Yeah.

729
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,920
So, in this next clip, Alex discusses the cycle of history.

730
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,400
He has some interesting theories about this, but it's pretty simple, based on his assessment.

731
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
Okay.

732
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,800
What happens throughout history?

733
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,800
Good question.

734
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Stuff.

735
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:48,440
Governments get power, whether it be in ancient China or ancient Middle East, or ancient Mesoamerica

736
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,640
or ancient Europe, and routinely, they have periods where there'll be whole kingdoms,

737
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,640
whole civilizations of thriving people, and just suddenly, there's no one left.

738
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,480
And this archeologist go there, there's archeological digs in Germany, archeological digs in Mexico,

739
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,120
everywhere.

740
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,880
Archeological digs in Africa, and they'll build a civilization, and then within a hundred

741
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,240
years, everybody's dead, and they find them all sacrificed.

742
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,120
The final phase, eaten by the priest class.

743
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
Sure, sure.

744
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
Yes.

745
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,800
There is a demonic force, ladies and gentlemen, that's trying to depopulate us, and they're

746
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
announcing it publicly.

747
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
I'm going to break it down on the other side.

748
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,840
This is the most important broadcast in the world.

749
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,200
This is the cycle of history.

750
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Wow.

751
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
Wow.

752
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,500
I wish there was some way that every archeological dig throughout history found some sort of

753
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:46,240
recording or a tablet or something, and it's all just the same Alex Jones ideas.

754
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,920
Like every civilization has been ultimately destroyed by somebody like Alex Jones.

755
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:58,520
Someone who thinks that all history is a cycle of decadence leading to the priest eating

756
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
everyone.

757
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:05,040
There's had to be somebody in ancient Rome just running around screaming like, the priest

758
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
class is eating people.

759
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
They're eating people.

760
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Almost certainly.

761
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
Ah, ah, ah.

762
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Yes.

763
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:15,360
I would say that maybe in crueler times they had less of an influence.

764
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,360
Sure, possible.

765
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,360
Because they couldn't ever-

766
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,360
There's so much cruelty.

767
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,560
Well, because they could never get to a point where they would have a radio show.

768
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,560
Sure, that's fair.

769
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
You know, people would just like-

770
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Kill them.

771
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
Yeah.

772
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,880
And I'm not saying that's the ideal solution.

773
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,600
No, I don't think so.

774
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,360
I do guarantee that this sort of mentality has probably existed throughout all cultures.

775
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,480
Yeah, I would probably argue that most governments-

776
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,480
I mean, it's just paranoia, right?

777
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

778
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,120
I mean, on a basic level it's all just like sort of imaginative, creative paranoia.

779
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
Yeah.

780
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,920
Yeah, I mean, I suppose you could probably make a very good argument that every civilization

781
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:56,120
ultimately collapses when the perceived corruption of the government equals the actual corruption

782
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
of the government.

783
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,120
Hmm.

784
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
Do you know what I'm saying?

785
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
I hear what you're saying.

786
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,960
I don't know how I could test that in the moment.

787
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,600
I don't know how I could test your theory.

788
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
Okay.

789
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
I'm not sure-

790
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
Let me give you an analogy.

791
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
I slaughtered a cow.

792
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
I slaughtered a cow.

793
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Yep.

794
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Alright, move on.

795
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Deep freeze?

796
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
Next one.

797
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
No, I understand what you're saying.

798
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,600
I think it's an interesting thought, but I don't know if I fully agree with you.

799
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Yeah, no.

800
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
I don't know if it's accurate, but it's an interesting thought.

801
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,080
I don't know if I fully agree with me.

802
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,200
Well, it's well said.

803
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
It sounds really great, doesn't it?

804
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
It sounds almost like an aphorism.

805
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Yeah, it really does.

806
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Yeah.

807
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,760
Society collapses when the perceived corruption matches the actual corruption.

808
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,760
You could see that on a pillow.

809
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,760
It sounds like something somebody smart would say.

810
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
Yeah.

811
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,880
Never mind, I take back my comment because now it's pillow worthy.

812
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
Yeah, yeah.

813
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
So it's probably not true.

814
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,880
No.

815
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,880
No, definitely not true.

816
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
No.

817
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,880
It's probably economics.

818
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
Yeah.

819
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,480
I worry about it being bullshit because it sounds good.

820
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
It sounds so good.

821
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
Yeah.

822
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Yep.

823
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,360
Speaking of things that are bullshit-

824
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
Shao Kahn jokes?

825
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:59,880
Caravan, at some points, more than 400 cars, some join, some leave, is on its way right

826
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,080
now and is in North Carolina.

827
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,360
There's absolutely zero chance that there have been 400 cars in the caravan at any point,

828
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,240
and I would be comfortable betting that there wasn't even a total of 400 cars throughout

829
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,400
the entire thing.

830
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,080
I would go so far as to bet that the combined turnout for the events that have happened

831
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,600
up to this point on November 12th are barely more than 400 total people.

832
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
I would agree.

833
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,560
This is insane levels of hubris.

834
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,560
Yeah, there aren't enough people in the cars themselves.

835
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,240
It's not like there's four people to a car where if you guys could all afford your own

836
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,880
individual cars, there would be 200 cars.

837
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
Yeah.

838
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
No.

839
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
There's five guys.

840
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,200
I'm offended that there probably are 10 cars.

841
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,080
That to me is shocking and scary.

842
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
What are you guys doing?

843
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,080
What are you guys doing?

844
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,580
Three of the cars are probably Infowars employees.

845
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,960
Another one is the guy from Just Another Channel.

846
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,160
Another car is the Hippies for Trump.

847
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160
They're not busy.

848
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,160
No.

849
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
This is their dream.

850
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
This is their dream.

851
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,360
We want to live the hippie lifestyle while also supporting a political mandate that is

852
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,720
trying to actively kill us.

853
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,080
My grandpa followed the Grateful Dead around.

854
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,200
I'm following Owen Schroyer.

855
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
Oh, man.

856
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,920
Oh, that's real bad.

857
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,840
You know where the best place to get drugs is?

858
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,480
The parking lot of an Owen Schroyer show.

859
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,120
Who's my real dad, mom?

860
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:24,560
Well, back in the 2020s, Owen Schroyer came through South Carolina and we spent one magical

861
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,320
night together on the Infowars caravan.

862
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:34,280
And here you are.

863
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,720
Like 70-year-old people with Infowars caravan tattoos.

864
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Where were you, man?

865
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
Oh, man.

866
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,800
You should have seen it.

867
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,440
There were upwards of 50 people.

868
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:52,560
If you can remember the Infowars caravan, that means you weren't there.

869
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,400
You sad bastards.

870
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Oh, God.

871
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
It's a bummer.

872
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
It's just a bummer.

873
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
It's such a bummer.

874
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
It's such a bummer.

875
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
Anyway.

876
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Oh, man.

877
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Let's get back to house.

878
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
What did you do?

879
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,400
I followed Pat Robertson around for a summer.

880
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
What?

881
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,600
I do love the idea.

882
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,600
All right.

883
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,520
We can't live in 18 different versions of that exact same joke.

884
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,440
We jump back to Alex and I will say that there is one thing that Alex is pretty consistent

885
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
on.

886
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
It's something he's very wrong about.

887
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,320
And that is that he does not exaggerate things.

888
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,240
He talks about that a little bit here.

889
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,320
I've thought about doing this broadcast for 26 plus years.

890
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,840
You always think about what could be your last broadcast.

891
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,840
I'm not saying this is my last broadcast, but I need to just let you know, I need to

892
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,640
explain something to you that I don't exaggerate any of this, okay?

893
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,360
Most of the time it's worse than I'm telling you.

894
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,800
And this could be our last broadcast next week could be, but the zone we're in right

895
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,440
now, the internet kill switch they've got, they can hit telecommunications as well.

896
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,840
And we're in the prime zone for them to assassinate Trump, set a nuke off, anything.

897
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,080
Well, good thing you don't exaggerate.

898
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,760
Never ever feel safe.

899
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,960
I don't exaggerate things, but if you spend one single moment in safety, you're an idiot.

900
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,920
Does this mean that this is the actual last broadcast that he's been teasing doing to

901
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,600
play after he's done?

902
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
If he's never exaggerated anything.

903
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Because that would imply that he's already quitting.

904
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

905
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
It's very weird.

906
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,960
I don't know what's going on because he's talking about this sort of like it could be

907
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
his last broadcast.

908
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
It's not.

909
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
He's on tomorrow.

910
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
No, obviously.

911
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,000
It's on the next day, but like I want him to do that fucking mythical last broadcast

912
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
already.

913
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah, it has to.

914
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Yeah.

915
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,440
How can you say I don't exaggerate things and then say this could be our last broadcast

916
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,280
knowing full well that you've got at least several more months in the, you know, like

917
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,840
you're very an asshole.

918
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,520
Your very exhortation for money is in and of itself an exaggeration.

919
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
Yeah.

920
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520
Cause you're an ass.

921
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
Yeah.

922
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,200
Um, this, this sort of thing though, this extremeness is, is really escalating here

923
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,960
in this, this stretch of time.

924
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,680
I guess maybe Alex is disappointed in the care event cause he's talking about like,

925
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,920
you know, a nuke's going to go off, Trump could get assassinated or turn off the internet.

926
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,920
Why not?

927
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,960
Uh, he basically in this next loop just says, head to the Hills guys.

928
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,960
It's over.

929
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,000
I have been under such stress knowing that we have a chance to stop this and save billions

930
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
of people.

931
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,880
And the stress has been on me that I, Howard Stern made jokes about it and it's a funny

932
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,680
viral video, but I had three molars collapsed the last two months.

933
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,920
I mean, all my teeth are literally crushing and falling out of my face.

934
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,360
Uh, I have to wear those fucking pills on it and I'm not feeling sorry for myself.

935
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:42,400
My spirit is absolutely lashing out at this and in fighting and God really last night

936
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,480
said to the Holy spirit to me to comfort me and to say, listen, this is the way it's going

937
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,280
to be and it's your job is just get people ready and you've done your job.

938
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,960
Now you just need to get them ready.

939
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,100
So I'm just going to tell you it's all over folks.

940
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,160
The best thing you can do is get to the countryside somewhere and try to dig in because it's all

941
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,560
just going to get worse.

942
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,640
Holy shit.

943
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,320
The only thing that differentiates Alex from someone like Jim Jones is that Jim Jones was

944
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
specific.

945
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,320
Yeah.

946
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,320
Yeah.

947
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
Also not for nothing.

948
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,400
Like you even responded to this being passionate doesn't result in grinding your teeth to the

949
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,160
point they fall out of your head.

950
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,600
However, that's one of the most common symptoms of stimulant abuse between that pretty much

951
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,640
everything about how Alex acts and the fact that Joe Rogan tried to get Alex to talk about

952
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,360
his problem with Adderall on their last episode kind of makes the picture come into focus.

953
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,200
Alex might as well be like a high functioning coke head.

954
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,200
Yeah.

955
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:41,240
This is, this is the, it all makes a bit more sense when you imagine that, Oh yeah, he's

956
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,240
on stimulants.

957
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,240
Yep.

958
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,680
That's a disappointingly simple answer, but probably the correct one.

959
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,680
Yeah.

960
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,320
Well, I don't think it makes a, uh, I don't think it explains everything.

961
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,480
Obviously there's still a whole bunch of ideas that are bad and it certainly doesn't let

962
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,960
him off the hook for his behavior, but it does make it like a lot of things that don't

963
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,080
make sense do make sense when you consider like, Oh, he's just on drugs.

964
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,080
Yeah.

965
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,080
Yeah.

966
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
Yeah.

967
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,080
That's about right.

968
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,320
Billions are going to die and you got to head to the Hills.

969
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,320
Sure.

970
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,800
Alex needs you to know billions are going to die.

971
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
He doesn't exaggerate though.

972
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Billions are going to die.

973
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Oh shit.

974
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,880
They're going to release mass bio weapons and kill billions of people and I don't just

975
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,680
say that you will watch billions die with blood pouring out of their eyes, their ears,

976
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,680
their mouths.

977
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,680
Okay, cool.

978
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,440
I mean, you're, you're going to watch absolute mass extermination.

979
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
We didn't stand up for the children.

980
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,460
We didn't stand up for God and we rejected Christ and Satan now is coming into the earth

981
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,760
and I'm not trying to be negative.

982
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,280
Everybody wants to hear all this positive lies.

983
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,040
All you can do is get right with Christ.

984
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,600
I can just tell you right now, we can hold them back.

985
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,840
Trump may still prevail, but we've seen the model of the devil's attack.

986
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,460
It's exactly what revelation says, but now we're in it.

987
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:02,600
We are now entering Satan's first big lash with his plan and he'll keep going and going

988
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,280
and going until he makes war on the saints and overcomes them.

989
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,640
It's going to be really difficult to go back to normal after that.

990
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,200
Um, no, we're living in the biblical end times.

991
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,760
There isn't like a really easy way to walk back.

992
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,160
We're in revelation because revelation doesn't include like false starts.

993
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,680
Guys, I got some good news for you.

994
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,000
They closed the third seal.

995
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,620
They closed the third seal back up, guys.

996
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,040
We've only got to deal with seals one and two.

997
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,040
Let's get to work.

998
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,240
Especially, there's going to need to be a lockdown to deal with all these goddamn plagues.

999
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:47,400
We have a special seal sealant and uh, yeah, get the fuck out of here.

1000
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
Yeah.

1001
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,400
It's troubling.

1002
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:55,240
It's troubling because like it feels like the only move after this is go away or become

1003
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,280
a doomsday like full on religious preacher.

1004
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,280
Yeah.

1005
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,280
I don't.

1006
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,040
They did all that stuff when Obama was elected to those, the biblical end times.

1007
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,160
I kept hearing about that.

1008
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
No, that's true.

1009
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,160
That's true.

1010
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,160
But I heard about the biblical end times an awful lot.

1011
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,480
Sure, but probably from biblical end times preachers.

1012
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
Well, yeah.

1013
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,080
They can be wrong a bunch of times.

1014
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,080
That's true.

1015
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,420
But they can't transition to something less extreme.

1016
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,880
You know, like they can say we were wrong or whatever.

1017
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,880
Sure.

1018
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,840
I mean, they could become a hot dog then.

1019
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,840
These are the blood moons.

1020
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,800
This is the real, you know, like you can do that.

1021
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,800
That would be fun.

1022
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,680
Like look, last time we thought we knew it was up, but this time blood moon.

1023
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,680
Yeah.

1024
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,280
But you can't be like, ah, the world is going to end.

1025
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,800
I know it's coming.

1026
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,620
And then be wrong and then be like, well, what you really need to do is focus on your

1027
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,200
alderman race or, or whatever.

1028
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:50,960
Or like, it's really tough to desensationalize from the point of end times.

1029
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:57,600
Well, I mean, that's again, like the idea of, of like, all right, we lost this one.

1030
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,640
Devil's going to win, but we got to focus on the midterms in order to defeat the devil

1031
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,640
again I guess.

1032
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,640
Right.

1033
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,520
And the other problem too is if you are an end times type, end times always got to be

1034
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,520
coming.

1035
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,520
Yeah.

1036
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,520
End times cannot be here.

1037
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,520
No, it's really bad when it's here.

1038
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,520
Yes.

1039
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,520
Yeah, that'll fuck you up.

1040
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,920
The money is in end times being coming down the road somewhere.

1041
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,920
Totally.

1042
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,920
It really screws things up when it's here.

1043
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:25,960
And I think Alex is going to, I don't know, I see this as a bad decision on his part.

1044
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,960
So Alex gets to talking about galactic laws, contract law for aliens.

1045
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,960
Sure.

1046
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,960
This is really stupid.

1047
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,080
This is fifth dimensional chess, huh?

1048
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,080
This is fucking stupid.

1049
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,440
I don't know all the timelines, but are the globalist always tell us what they're going

1050
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,920
to do in their internal documents that are public, but they don't promote them, but it's

1051
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,920
a metaphysical rule.

1052
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,920
They got to tell you what they're doing.

1053
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,440
Kind of leave the plans laying on the road side.

1054
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,880
So you have a chance to read the fine print if you can find it, kind of a public notice.

1055
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,880
That's why you have public notice that they're going to take a piece of property or public

1056
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,680
notice they're about to tear something down or public notice they're about to take a park

1057
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,680
away from you.

1058
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:03,480
Because they have to give you notice because you have metaphysical, spiritual rights, unalienable

1059
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,600
rights to challenge that.

1060
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,080
This is common law, this is galactic law, this is God's law, and even the devil has

1061
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,080
to follow it.

1062
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:14,300
This is a comically childish and stupid view of morality, and I would just like to take

1063
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,840
everyone who claims that Alex is smart and he has good points and ask them what they

1064
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,680
think of that, because that moral system that Alex is presenting is really hard to defend

1065
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,760
if you want to look at human history.

1066
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,220
It's simple enough to say that everyone who deprived people of their unalienable rights

1067
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,040
went to hell after they died.

1068
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,040
Like Thomas Jefferson.

1069
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,400
Uh, yeah, that's kind of a problem.

1070
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:39,520
Alex would have to then either say that slavery doesn't violate unalienable rights or a bunch

1071
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,220
of his heroes and ancestors are in hell.

1072
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,100
But leaving that aside, looking at the actions that are ascribed to the devil in traditional

1073
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,600
Christian lore, I don't see where he's warning people what he's going to do before he does

1074
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,600
it.

1075
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,240
In the Garden of Eden, it's God who tells them not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge.

1076
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,720
If God hadn't done that, then the serpent would presumably have done the exact same

1077
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,320
thing it did in the story and convinced Adam and Eve to eat the fruit.

1078
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,040
The serpent didn't do anything except a manipulative, evil act.

1079
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,520
The part where there was a warning came from someone else entirely.

1080
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,340
So in order for this to make any sense in Alex's moral conception, the morality or immorality

1081
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:19,000
of your actions can be determined by other people's actions.

1082
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,440
This would imply that it would be very wrong for me to punch you randomly and without warning.

1083
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,800
However, if someone were to tell you Dan is going to punch you when you go to his house,

1084
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,240
then my punch would be completely fine, because someone else let you know that it was coming

1085
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,320
and you chose to come here anyway.

1086
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:40,040
In fact, in this conception, it could be argued that me punching you is never immoral in and

1087
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,400
of itself.

1088
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,020
If my punch is morally correct when someone else warns you and morally incorrect when

1089
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,000
they do not, the actual distinction is the warning itself.

1090
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,080
That's where the moral weight lies, so it becomes a matter of the other person doing

1091
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,560
something immoral by not warning you.

1092
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,520
My punch doesn't matter at all.

1093
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,280
So then, what if no one else knows that I'm going to punch you?

1094
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,080
Then apparently I have to tell you ahead of time that I plan to punch you, and then if

1095
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,960
you come over anyway, you've consented to being punched.

1096
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,080
This is stupid for a number of reasons.

1097
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,040
To what extent do I need to make sure that you're aware that I'm going to punch you?

1098
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,080
You have to serve people before you punch them.

1099
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:22,280
Is it enough that I mumble it to you as you leave, knowing that you'll probably not hear

1100
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,440
me or forget by the time we end up getting together to record again?

1101
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,900
I think you have to put it in a movie.

1102
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,340
Is it enough for me to write, I'm going to punch Jordan the next time he comes over on

1103
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:35,260
a piece of paper that I taped to a lamppost two miles north of my house, knowing that

1104
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,640
you'll never pass that lamppost?

1105
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,360
That's how Arthur Dent got that bypass.

1106
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,920
Could that satisfy the metaphysical condition, even though there's literally no way it could

1107
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,680
ever impact your behavior?

1108
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,700
Ask the Vogons.

1109
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,380
You could say that the warning was there if you wanted to look for it, and it's really

1110
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:55,080
your fault that you didn't find that lamppost, it was right there in the open for everyone

1111
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,100
to see.

1112
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:00,720
To what extent does the person the thing is being done to need to be aware of the thing

1113
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,240
that's going to be done to them?

1114
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,300
This is a question that Alex cannot answer, because no matter what the answer is, shit

1115
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,000
doesn't make sense.

1116
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,400
If the standard is informed consent, then the globalists need to be doing way more warning

1117
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,320
than they're doing right now, and honestly would probably need to get literally everyone

1118
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:22,400
to sign off on their plans, knowing the implications of what they're agreeing to, so it obviously

1119
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,880
can't be that.

1120
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,780
If the standard is that the person needs to believe the warning, is that possible, that

1121
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,200
you need to believe it?

1122
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,440
Because even if that's the standard, I still don't think you deserve to be punched for

1123
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,160
coming over, whether or not you believe the warning.

1124
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,120
You might not believe it, someone could say Dan's going to punch you if you come over

1125
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,880
and you'd be like, ah fuck you.

1126
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,600
But you understand that this line of thinking makes perfect sense because of the way that

1127
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,200
all of these people have to deal with hell?

1128
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,040
Like okay, if everybody that doesn't accept Jesus Christ into their heart is going to

1129
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,480
hell, Jesus didn't get his message out for a good long while to the rest of the world,

1130
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,560
so all of those people, despite never having heard of Jesus Christ spend eternity in hell

1131
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:09,360
just because God was like, nah geographical product placement.

1132
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:14,160
So your argument then has to be, well there's evidence of God all around you, so you should

1133
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,120
have known that God was real, and obviously Christ, if there's a God there's got to be

1134
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,120
a Christ.

1135
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,280
So it's still your fault, and that's why hell is justifiable to people who've never heard

1136
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,280
of Christianity.

1137
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:30,740
That might be, I think that you're trying to bring too much sense to it, and I'm trying

1138
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,040
to deconstruct this from an ethical perspective.

1139
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,960
I'm saying that you've deconstructed both fairly well.

1140
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,320
Well see, here's what I think that Alex would say the standard is.

1141
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,480
He would say that the standard that you need to achieve is that you need to publicly admit

1142
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,480
this somewhere, so even if you do it in code that's only decipherable to a genius like

1143
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,440
Alex Jones, that's still good enough.

1144
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,400
I struggle to see how this qualifies as warning people in an ethically meaningful way, for

1145
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,160
the same reason that my message taped to a lamppost doesn't seem like it could reasonably

1146
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,640
be seen as possibly impacting your behavior.

1147
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,520
I mean, you know, Dan, we're dealing with Satan and God.

1148
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,120
There's obviously a lot of wiggle room in the rules.

1149
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,120
Those two guys aren't known for absolutes.

1150
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,880
Alex is talking about human behavior too.

1151
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,120
Oh shit, well we're fucked.

1152
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:16,920
In order to make this morality work, it must not be the would-be victims of the crime that

1153
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,080
are required to be warned about what this person's going to do.

1154
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,760
It must be a thing where the act of writing it down and putting it out there is to serve

1155
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,360
as a notice to God of their intentions, but what kind of sense does that make?

1156
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,280
Also what are the consequences for breaking these supposed galactic laws, and why should

1157
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,440
the devil be concerned with any punishment?

1158
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,480
He's already the fucking devil.

1159
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,480
Disintegration.

1160
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,440
It's the punishment he fears most.

1161
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,440
Well then what?

1162
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,000
Okay, so he does that and then he disintegrates, great, there's no devil anymore, hooray!

1163
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,160
Well, but God would have to create another devil, otherwise his prophecy wouldn't come

1164
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,160
true.

1165
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,520
See, again, here's where I'm really struggling with Alex and all this bullshit.

1166
00:49:54,520 --> 00:50:00,240
You understand that for your actual religion to not be bullshit, you have to have the end

1167
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,240
times.

1168
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,560
You can't stop them.

1169
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,560
You can't delay them.

1170
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,840
It's God's moment.

1171
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,160
He chooses.

1172
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:12,760
There's no way that Biden is going to affect God's plan, otherwise your entire religion

1173
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,760
is nonsense.

1174
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,160
Yeah, and you can't vote on the devil.

1175
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,920
You can't vote on the devil!

1176
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,560
I'm assuming Job would have had a different vote.

1177
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,720
This is the moral system of a child, and honestly it's embarrassing to hear him try to explain

1178
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,720
his beliefs.

1179
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,320
It also kind of makes me sad to hear how small his vision of the divine is.

1180
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:35,720
It's the same kind of bummer I get whenever I hear people on Project Camelot talking about

1181
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,760
like alien contracts and stuff, it's like ugh.

1182
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,840
Come on.

1183
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:45,100
Are you saying to me that even if we get beyond the stars, we're never going to get past the

1184
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:51,120
point where a signature is going to hold the entire universe together?

1185
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,000
It's still just going to be a signature.

1186
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,200
Yeah, and God is trying to get the devil on technicalities or something.

1187
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,200
Exactly!

1188
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,200
Alright.

1189
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,200
Aha!

1190
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,200
We have him on a Rico case!

1191
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,200
Yeah.

1192
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,560
So, at this point, Alex does something incredibly familiar.

1193
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:12,200
Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, broadcasting worldwide again, we are back live broadcasting

1194
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,200
worldwide.

1195
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:20,120
I am your host, Alex Jones, very, very thankful to be here with you today.

1196
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:24,760
And I believe I'm connected, I believe I'm live, but, okay, we're going to rebroadcast

1197
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,040
for a while, and I will be back because I've got to reset and go into this.

1198
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:37,080
No, I'm cool now, I've got to reset, I can't do it, so there's too much going down here.

1199
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,280
So, as I was saying, I've got some really important news we're going to be covering

1200
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,920
here until you get reset.

1201
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,040
And I sent you guys a lot of videos, I sent you guys a lot of things.

1202
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:54,000
And so, the first thing that I'm going to want to play is whatever you guys want to.

1203
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I'll be back in a little while.

1204
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
What?

1205
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
What just happened there?

1206
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,360
This is an important announcement.

1207
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,360
So I was thinking about this and wondering, what the fuck is going on?

1208
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,360
Yeah.

1209
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,720
Alex is in DC now, he's already arrived in DC, so you lost the bet.

1210
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:14,200
So he's freaking out trying to do this show remotely, and it sounds like shit.

1211
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,140
Like there's a lot of audio crackliness, it's just terrible.

1212
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:21,500
And honestly, even beyond that, his heart is not in it.

1213
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,000
So he freaks out a little bit and he goes to rebroadcast, it honestly wasn't surprising

1214
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
to me at all.

1215
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,240
It honestly seemed like a prudent decision.

1216
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,520
The only real question to me is, why is he hosting at all?

1217
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,520
Good question.

1218
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,840
Then it dawned on me, there's probably no one else who can host.

1219
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,000
Schroyer's on the caravan.

1220
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
David Knight is definitely not a primetime candidate.

1221
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,360
Well, I think David Knight, he has his own show, and he had a heart attack like a year

1222
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,360
ago.

1223
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,360
Oh, that's true.

1224
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,680
And his workload, for his own sake, I think it's great that he's not taking on unnecessary

1225
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,800
burdens, but I think that he would probably not be the person who would, and he's not

1226
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,080
gonna move product.

1227
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:03,240
And Millie Weaver is gone forever, Deanna Lorraine is terrible.

1228
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,160
She's too green, probably for the main show.

1229
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,760
Same problem with Harrison Smith, like he can fill in on the War Room because no one's

1230
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:16,120
watching that, but actual Owen show, or I'm sorry, actual Alex show, seems like it's probably

1231
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,120
no good.

1232
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,200
Millie Weaver is gone, like he can't talk to Mike Adams anymore.

1233
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,200
No, of course not.

1234
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:26,320
All the fourth hour fill-in hosts are either, like, they wouldn't do it, or, how are you

1235
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,160
gonna have three and a half, four hours of Gerald Cilenti?

1236
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,000
It's too much.

1237
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,760
Are those the funeral bells?

1238
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,760
Because I can hear Roger Stone's name coming right down the pipe.

1239
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,760
He's day drunk.

1240
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,760
That's true.

1241
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,760
He's fucked up.

1242
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,760
See, now that's what I want.

1243
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,480
I want three hours of rambly day drunk Roger Stone.

1244
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,480
I do not.

1245
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,480
I listen to it.

1246
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,480
I do not want it.

1247
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,480
Fair.

1248
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,920
There will literally be no one left at Info Wars who's able to fill in for Alex.

1249
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,240
It's interesting, in a way.

1250
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,200
He's kind of reached the pinnacle of success, but at the same time, he's right where he

1251
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,200
started.

1252
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,160
He's got a giant business with a ton of employees, but he still needs to do everything himself

1253
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,720
because everyone sucks.

1254
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,560
He's the president's biggest cheerleader, but he's still ignored and cast aside in favor

1255
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:11,080
of more seemingly acceptable right-wing commentators, same as it ever was.

1256
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,600
I feel like you should realize that the path he's on leads nowhere, and it never has.

1257
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,640
It started with him being alone, and it's going to end with him being alone, and good

1258
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,120
luck to you, buddy.

1259
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,480
Except there's some good news.

1260
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,480
What's that?

1261
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,560
He goes off air, and he comes back, and then he starts talking about having cancer, and

1262
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,560
I was like-

1263
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,560
Wait, what now?

1264
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,560
I was like, wait, do you actually have cancer?

1265
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,560
It's like, nah, I don't have cancer.

1266
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,560
Oh, okay.

1267
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,120
Just the only way I can talk to you is from the heart and where I'm at before I hit all

1268
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,400
this news.

1269
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,920
I am devastated.

1270
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,920
I am devastated.

1271
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:49,040
It's not just that I've learned that I have cancer, and that I'm dying.

1272
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,400
It's I've learned we all have cancer, and we're all dying.

1273
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,400
I don't literally have cancer, though you have cancer every day, and your body kills

1274
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,400
it with your immune system.

1275
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,400
Oh my God.

1276
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,400
Okay.

1277
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,400
All right, buddy.

1278
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,400
Okay.

1279
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,400
All right.

1280
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,400
You didn't even need to add that shit.

1281
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,400
No.

1282
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,400
Just say I don't have cancer.

1283
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,520
But I could always be fighting off cancer any moment of any day.

1284
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:12,360
That weirded me out, because I kind of felt like, oh, that makes sense, you have cancer.

1285
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,960
I don't know.

1286
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,160
I would believe it if he was like, I have terminal cancer.

1287
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,880
Oh, well, yeah, okay.

1288
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,880
Shit.

1289
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,240
Well, no wonder you want the world to end.

1290
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,240
Yeah.

1291
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,240
Your narcissism is experiencing it that way.

1292
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,240
You don't want to go alone.

1293
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,240
Yeah, yeah.

1294
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,240
Well, no.

1295
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,240
Unfortunately, that is not the explanation.

1296
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,860
Not unfortunately, I don't even know how I would put it, but that's not the explanation.

1297
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,560
He just thinks that everyone's going to die.

1298
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,920
But you should know, he's not happy to report that.

1299
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,920
Sure.

1300
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,400
I'm sitting here last night and this morning, thinking about what I'm going to say today

1301
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,960
on the air because of all the announcements and all the statements that have been made,

1302
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:51,960
confirming our worst analysis and then some, and I don't feel good coming on air, telling

1303
00:55:51,960 --> 00:56:00,380
you that we're all dead.

1304
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:04,640
But I want to explain to you the reality of this, and we'll do it next segment because

1305
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,200
I'm very emotional right now.

1306
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,200
Sound like it.

1307
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,200
Yeah.

1308
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,200
Yep.

1309
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,200
Very emotional right now.

1310
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,200
Oh boy.

1311
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,200
All right.

1312
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,200
I don't want to, man.

1313
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,200
And now I just, now that we kind of get more of the gist of what he told his kids at the

1314
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:21,760
breakfast table, you're going to watch billions die is like not a good morning.

1315
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,960
Kids, you got to head to the hills.

1316
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,960
No kidding.

1317
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,760
Hey, we can do remote learning as far remote as we need to be.

1318
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,260
Hey, look, I got some John Birch society books.

1319
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,280
That's all the book learning you need.

1320
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,240
So yeah, I mean, we're all going to die and Alex takes no pleasure in reporting that.

1321
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,240
That's nice of him.

1322
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:44,240
I think he kind of wouldn't be reporting that if Trump had won the election, which is weird.

1323
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,280
But it turns out the election stolen.

1324
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:50,320
They stole this bigger than Dallas in front of everybody.

1325
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:55,880
But Hey, if you catch somebody in your house with the safe or in your house with the computers

1326
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:00,420
or in your house with a silverware and then the family heirlooms, do you have a right

1327
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,120
to take it back?

1328
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,940
Damn right you do.

1329
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,800
And so they are panicking.

1330
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,280
They're saying have a coup against Trump all over the news.

1331
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,540
They're saying he's insane.

1332
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:13,320
He's crazy because he's not going to let them have this fifth attempted coup against us

1333
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,320
separately.

1334
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,880
You've got my commitment to burn the candle at both ends here, ladies and gentlemen, and

1335
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,880
we're fighting hard here.

1336
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,880
We need your financial support info or store.com bringing a caravan up here and flying here

1337
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,880
with the crew and all.

1338
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,880
We love you.

1339
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,880
We appreciate you.

1340
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,520
Info or store.com bringing this caravan up here is a shockingly pointless and spent a

1341
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,000
lot on gas for no reason.

1342
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Yeah.

1343
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
No grammar.

1344
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I do.

1345
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,520
I do appreciate the, the if you know, if you catch a robber in your house, you know, that's,

1346
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,520
that's good.

1347
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:47,760
If you catch, you know, you have a right to defend yourself, et cetera.

1348
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:53,360
But if instead of doing that, you're a, you lose something and then you drive to DC and

1349
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,760
murder someone who has, you've never met before and who's never been to where you live.

1350
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,160
It's not quite the same as a robber.

1351
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,400
It's not the same thing.

1352
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,920
No, I would, I would argue it feels similar to Alex.

1353
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,920
It does though.

1354
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,920
Yeah.

1355
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,920
Yeah.

1356
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,920
Cause of metaphysical laws.

1357
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:07,920
Sure.

1358
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,120
Um, so the Alex is, you know, I think you can tell also from that clip that the audio

1359
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,240
has not gotten better.

1360
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,240
No.

1361
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,240
And so Alex gets really mad again.

1362
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,240
Of course.

1363
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,240
I'm on the road.

1364
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,240
I'm here in Washington, DC.

1365
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:21,120
I'm having a lot of technical difficulties, but I'm just gonna stay on here as best as

1366
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,120
I can.

1367
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,120
They're on the break.

1368
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,080
We'll try to fix the big muddy signal.

1369
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,200
I'm getting blessed in my ear, but that's okay.

1370
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,080
That's why I like to go just with a laptop, just straight Skype.

1371
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,080
It's like clean.

1372
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,560
You got this big fan dangled thing.

1373
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,080
It looks like a space shuttle over here and it's just, it just hammers the hell out of

1374
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,080
me every time.

1375
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,520
I got to make an executive decision.

1376
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,520
I'm going to rebroadcast.

1377
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,520
I'm going to plug in all this.

1378
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:48,960
I'm going to laptop because, uh, yeah, it'll take a while, but it's okay.

1379
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,120
You know, we're real, we're real transmission there.

1380
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,760
I'm just trying the best I can here.

1381
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,760
I'm not complaining either.

1382
00:58:54,760 --> 00:59:00,320
It's just, uh, God, the whole country's going to hell in a ham basket, man.

1383
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,320
I feel it.

1384
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:05,280
We're still having broadcasting issues, so of course the entire country is falling apart

1385
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,280
naturally.

1386
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:11,320
Isn't, isn't my shitty set up just indicative of the state of the world?

1387
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:19,200
Isn't it strange that me, Alex Jones of Info Wars would have issues with my phone connection.

1388
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:24,640
Hey, I constantly have these tech issues that plague me in studio and out and every time

1389
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,800
I try and take a phone call from somebody and now here I am trying to broadcast from

1390
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,640
DC and I'm having problems, it's somehow I'm surprised by it.

1391
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,280
It's a shock and the world is clearly going to hell.

1392
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,280
Totally.

1393
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,640
I will say that it's not, it's interesting that there's, this happens twice on this show.

1394
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,640
Of course.

1395
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:45,440
Uh, I think I don't, I don't recall the last time he's done this twice, um, but he ends

1396
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,680
up vamping until the commercial breaks, so he doesn't actually have to storm out a second

1397
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,680
time.

1398
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,620
Um, but he ends up leaving early.

1399
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:56,400
Of course he ends up, uh, he's got more fun things to do.

1400
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,400
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

1401
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,400
Yeah, totally.

1402
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,080
He's wearing a hat, got cattle.

1403
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:07,960
So that's what it comes down to, how I'm out riding the range, which I wish I was doing

1404
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,960
checking the fences.

1405
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,480
I might be wearing a Stetson, but I don't, I'm not lucky enough to get to do that because

1406
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:20,280
my country is in so much damn peril, but I can't like Hank Williams Jr.

1407
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:24,720
I like to ride my horse and shoot my gun.

1408
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:31,000
Every boy's work she's never done, now the rest of the song goes.

1409
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,920
That Lord has certainly made a lot of beautiful women out there, honey.

1410
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:36,920
Wow.

1411
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:43,560
Harrison Smith is going to be taken over, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm tempted to pop

1412
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:51,760
back in, but, uh, I won't, I was here mentioning all this news.

1413
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,640
All this information, this unfolding hell, there's been so many people in this hotel

1414
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,040
room walking back and forth.

1415
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,480
I can't even remember what the last clip was.

1416
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,480
I was going to play.

1417
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,680
Well, what was the next clip guys?

1418
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:08,320
I was going to get there.

1419
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,320
That's right.

1420
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,320
That's where I wanted to go.

1421
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,080
So this is a great ad for brain force.

1422
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:18,520
Um, you know, these sort of new tropics, these supplements that give you focus and clarity

1423
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,640
and the ability to really stay on task.

1424
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,880
Yeah, and the ability to disintegrating.

1425
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,280
That one's also a real eye opener.

1426
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:30,000
The ability, like when you talk about mental fog versus clarity, you're talking about the

1427
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,960
ability to do a radio show in a hotel room where there are other people present.

1428
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:35,960
Yeah.

1429
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:40,680
God, just, anyway, Harrison Smith takes over for like the last half hour and I think that's

1430
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,680
about right.

1431
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,120
I think that's, that's about what he can handle.

1432
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,440
He's boring as shit.

1433
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,080
He's terrible, but give him a little time.

1434
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,080
Yeah.

1435
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,080
Get his feet wet.

1436
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,080
Yeah.

1437
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,080
Give him five minutes up top.

1438
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,080
He'll start the show.

1439
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,080
Yeah.

1440
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,080
Yeah.

1441
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,080
It's that kind of thing.

1442
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,080
Yeah, for sure.

1443
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,080
It's that, it's that, uh, that standup show.

1444
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:00,120
It's like, all right, I want you to get some experience, but we still have to move some

1445
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:03,280
product so we have to keep the audience happy.

1446
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,280
So Alex is going to do most of it, although he's not going to do much.

1447
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,280
No.

1448
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:15,480
So, uh, that night or that day in a caravan activities, it was really stormy that day

1449
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,560
for Owen.

1450
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:21,040
So he talked to an underwhelming group of people in the rain in, uh, in North Carolina

1451
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,680
about how the election was stolen.

1452
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,680
Sure.

1453
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,460
And honestly, by this point, the charm of the caravan caravan had worn off for me.

1454
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:28,600
It's redundant.

1455
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:33,120
It's unimpressive and ultimately it's too obvious what the game is.

1456
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:37,040
This is all about creating the optics of taking your dumb show on the road, arriving at a

1457
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:41,320
much larger event and then giving yourself credit for the turnout at the large event.

1458
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,320
Yeah, totally.

1459
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,120
It's honestly pretty disappointing.

1460
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,200
There was such great potential for this road trip.

1461
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,240
In the end, it's really forgettable.

1462
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,240
Yeah.

1463
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,640
I tried to find an angle of something interesting.

1464
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:54,840
We talked about the open mic comic who did the Shao Kahn impression.

1465
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:59,740
I tried to see if there was a human interest angle in here somewhere, but there just isn't.

1466
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:03,340
They had the opportunity to do something really interesting and compelling, and instead they

1467
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:05,960
did exactly what Infowars always does.

1468
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:09,480
They produced a cookie cutter performance that was meant to create profit and gather

1469
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,480
attention while funneling support to larger fascist movements.

1470
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:17,440
I'm really disappointed in them, but I also know there's not really anything else they

1471
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,080
can do.

1472
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:24,120
The only thing that's even close to interesting in this stretch is they did a damage control

1473
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:29,080
video in Raleigh where Greg Reese and some other employee discuss how someone gave them

1474
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,600
a book with a Nazi bookmark in it.

1475
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:35,480
Their angle, naturally, is that this was an agent provocateur leftist who was there to

1476
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:40,040
make Trump look bad, although I would argue it's equally possible it was just a fan who

1477
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,140
gave them a Nazi bookmark in a yoga book.

1478
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:47,840
After the Raleigh stop, they added on to Richmond, Virginia, and honestly, it's a fine turnout,

1479
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,500
but it's more of the same.

1480
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:54,000
My highlight is that a guy is playing the trumpet there while the crowd sings the national

1481
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,620
anthem, and a shot of the trumpet player happens to include a historical marker in the background.

1482
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:06,600
This was actually shot on the site of the 1863 Richmond Bread Riot, which is kinda fitting.

1483
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,880
The Union forces had hurt supply lines for the Confederacy, so prices of food had increased

1484
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,780
in Richmond considerably.

1485
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:17,760
From History.com, quote, on April 1st, a group of poor working women held a meeting in a

1486
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:22,040
Baptist church to organize a demonstration against the rising costs of food.

1487
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:26,360
Mary Jackson, a 34-year-old mother, and Martha Ferguson riled up the audience with tales

1488
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,160
of rampant speculation and price gouging happening in the markets.

1489
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:34,600
Soon, the mob was angry enough to agree to meet the very next day outside the Capitol

1490
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:38,600
building and extract bread and justice from the men in charge.

1491
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:42,880
The governor initially refused to meet with them, but then when he did, he was unsympathetic,

1492
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,680
so the mob went on a tear and started rioting.

1493
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:49,480
They stole food, but also luxury goods, until the riot police arrived and were prepared

1494
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,880
to fire.

1495
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,680
The reason that I think this is fitting that this ridiculous display was on this same site

1496
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:59,320
as the Bread Riot is because the aftermath of that riot was that the Confederacy tried

1497
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:03,920
really hard to keep it quiet, since they knew that word of this internal chaos would raise

1498
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,360
the morale of the Union armies.

1499
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,360
These videos are really things that Owen in Infowars should try to keep quiet.

1500
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:13,480
They're out there yelling about how this is the end of the country, and this caravan's

1501
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:16,760
the last battle, and these are the crowds they can draw?

1502
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:20,400
I don't know if that raises my morale, but I think it should hurt theirs if they looked

1503
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,400
at it honestly.

1504
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,760
Like, this is not impressive stuff.

1505
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,740
Yeah, I wouldn't like it.

1506
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:35,600
If I was doing that in any capacity, like, even, like, I went on tours where I made negative

1507
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,600
money.

1508
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,440
I think I've only exclusively done that.

1509
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,320
I think I broke even one stamp.

1510
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,320
Maybe.

1511
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,440
Maybe for me.

1512
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,240
But yeah, if I was doing this in any...

1513
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:53,240
Like, this would be bad for me on an amateur tour.

1514
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,800
Like that's the level of bad this is.

1515
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,880
Yeah.

1516
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:03,920
You might be able to get a little bit of b-roll from this for a larger thing.

1517
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:04,920
Yeah, that's true.

1518
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,640
Like the camp video?

1519
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,640
The wrap-up video?

1520
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,640
Yeah, maybe.

1521
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,640
But yeah, it's not...

1522
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,280
No, this isn't good.

1523
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:20,120
It seems to me like this is them throwing everything they've got, the most extreme language,

1524
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:25,700
the most immediacy possible, and it's still incredibly underwhelming.

1525
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:29,280
And I would be embarrassed of that if I were Infowars, and if I were Owen.

1526
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:34,880
I would treat this like the Confederacy treated the Bread Riot, and I would not have the Trumpeteer

1527
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,400
standing right in front of the memorial of that.

1528
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,400
Hide it.

1529
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,400
Yeah.

1530
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,400
Oh boy.

1531
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:46,480
So we jump to the 13th, Friday, and Alex is back hosting his show again from DC.

1532
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,480
From DC.

1533
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,480
That would have been really funny if he'd gone home.

1534
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,480
Yeah.

1535
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,600
Fuck it.

1536
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,600
We can't...

1537
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,440
I can't do it from here, and nobody is home!

1538
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,840
Trump called yesterday, but I was napping.

1539
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,840
Yeah.

1540
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,840
And I can't call him back.

1541
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:04,840
He drove by the hotel, and he stopped by, and I was napping, and he just couldn't get

1542
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,840
in!

1543
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,640
They wouldn't let him in because he didn't have a room!

1544
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,640
Yep.

1545
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,640
Classic hotel staff.

1546
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,640
Classic hotel.

1547
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:16,400
Yeah, it would be funny if you left, but instead he stayed and then just did nothing.

1548
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,400
Yeah.

1549
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,400
Except for yelling to a bullhorn.

1550
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,400
That sounds right.

1551
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:24,640
But here he is talking about what has happened on the caravan, and you would know that this

1552
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,740
wasn't true if you were keeping up with the caravan.

1553
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,740
How would I know?

1554
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:36,880
Well, we caught Antifa on the way here following us from Florida up into Virginia, now in DC,

1555
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:41,480
posing as patriots in handing out white supremacist literature.

1556
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:45,080
So that's going to be their main mission tomorrow.

1557
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:50,440
We actually caught them on video red-handed, and we actually intercepted their communications.

1558
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,440
We love you, Alex!

1559
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,800
Through a source.

1560
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,280
Here's our Nazi stuff!

1561
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,280
Through a mole.

1562
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,280
I'll sell them.

1563
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,280
We've infiltrated them.

1564
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:05,040
We're planning to dress like MAGA folks at the march tomorrow, be wearing their red baseball

1565
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:11,000
caps backwards, and wearing camouflage pants is how they're dressing.

1566
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,320
So Alex is just making all that up.

1567
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:19,480
And the only thing that's real is that book that someone gave them with a Nazi bookmark

1568
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:22,720
in it that they've decided is leftist agitators.

1569
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:28,440
And now he's turned this into they have a mole, and Antifa followed them from Florida

1570
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:34,100
up through the whole convoy all the way up, and there's plans for in DC, they're going

1571
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:39,800
to show up with backwards MAGA hats and camouflage pants, and they're going to hand out dirty

1572
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:44,000
literature to everyone to make the patriots look bad.

1573
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,160
So dumb.

1574
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:55,080
I can think of few things that would do more for the cause than Antifa joining that Infowars

1575
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,480
caravan as agent provocateurs.

1576
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:02,320
I just don't think there's anything else that could be done for the movement that would

1577
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,960
have that much effect.

1578
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:18,080
I don't think I've heard anybody but me talk about this.

1579
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,080
The caravan is just for them and us, isn't it?

1580
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:26,440
I'm not positive that I've seen any angry tweets about it or anything.

1581
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:31,120
I think I saw a couple people posting about the milkshake from the truckers.

1582
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,760
I think I saw a little bit of jokes about that.

1583
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:39,200
But in terms of this, I don't think anybody gives a shit except for them and me.

1584
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,960
I don't think Antifa's following anybody.

1585
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:48,420
It's really annoying that you spend all of your time whipping up white supremacists to

1586
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:52,480
fight for you, and then you're like, I don't know where all these white supremacists come

1587
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,480
from.

1588
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:54,480
Must be leftists.

1589
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,480
Must be Antifa.

1590
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,480
Come on, man.

1591
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,620
You've spent so much time loving these guys.

1592
01:09:58,620 --> 01:09:59,620
Let's just move on.

1593
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:00,700
It's a little much.

1594
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:03,120
Just say it.

1595
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,400
It's not going to alienate 48% of the country.

1596
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:10,680
It's not going to alienate the people who are still listening to you at this point.

1597
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:11,680
Exactly.

1598
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:15,480
If you can ramble about the literal devil all the fucking time and say all this nonsense

1599
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:19,040
bullshit and people don't leave, just mask off, man.

1600
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:23,240
Just toss a sig heil out there who fucking cares.

1601
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:27,940
But even if he does do that, these listeners, Nazi or otherwise, need to recognize that

1602
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,560
their lives are over.

1603
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:33,240
And so because their lives are over, it's time to go yell at the governor.

1604
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:37,880
OK, when you're tuning in, I want everybody to understand your life is over, as you know

1605
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,480
it, until you fight back.

1606
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:44,660
We need people every day surrounding the governor's mansion where Governor Abbott is.

1607
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:47,220
If he's in a restaurant eating, you don't go up and threaten him.

1608
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:50,440
You go up and you say, sir, we know you're being blackmailed.

1609
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,440
We know the lockdown's permanent.

1610
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,440
Be a leader and stop it.

1611
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,160
We need to start his recall.

1612
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:59,720
Smash cut to Alex complaining about people yelling at Trump officials at restaurants.

1613
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:02,120
A bunch of leftist provocateurs, yeah.

1614
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:06,200
Also, there are 20 states in the United States where a governor can be recalled, and Texas

1615
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,920
is not one of them.

1616
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,760
In order for Alex to do his plan about recalling Governor Abbott, he would first need to find

1617
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:18,080
justification for a new law in the Texas Constitution and then get a law passed by the state legislature.

1618
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,920
It would be a cumbersome process that he's not up for, and honestly, it would probably

1619
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:26,960
just be easier to wait until he's up for re-election and then field a fringe-ass candidate to lose

1620
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,120
to him and probably split the vote so a Democrat ends up winning.

1621
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,340
Also, Governor Abbott's not being blackmailed.

1622
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:37,300
He's still an incredibly far-right politician, just not far-right enough for Alex.

1623
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,400
He's failed Alex's purity tests.

1624
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:45,040
It's not illegal to write a law that just says Governor Abbott can never be governor,

1625
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,040
right?

1626
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,040
Abbott out.

1627
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,040
Yeah, no Abbott.

1628
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,040
No Abbott's forever.

1629
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,320
Yeah, that might be an interesting law.

1630
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,320
I would be interested in that law.

1631
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,120
I think it would get challenged.

1632
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,120
Someone would file a lawsuit.

1633
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:58,040
On what grounds?

1634
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,920
I'm not a lawyer.

1635
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:05,280
So in this next clip, this clip's a little bit long, but I kept it in because it begins

1636
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:10,800
with Alex talking about how he's not into offensive violence.

1637
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,480
And then it's quite a ramble about a bunch of nonsense.

1638
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:18,440
But I think I needed to play, it's two and a half minutes long, but the reason I wanted

1639
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:25,240
to play this whole chunk is like, if you listen to this, it's sort of an ABA kind of structure,

1640
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:32,200
where you have the A theme of offensive violence, then B is kind of just random talking points,

1641
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:37,600
spaghetti up against the wall, and then you return to what the thesis of the initial thought

1642
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,600
was.

1643
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:43,200
But by that point, your brain will, if you're not paying attention, you'll kind of already

1644
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,040
have forgotten that that's what he was talking about.

1645
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:54,320
And this happens quite a bit, but I rarely play full clips of it, just because it's long.

1646
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,480
And I don't want any offensive violence, but I see a lot of talk online, people saying

1647
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,760
time to dust off the muskets.

1648
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:05,260
Here's the issue, existentially, and I'll give you these clips of the big news.

1649
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:13,720
Under common law, under common sense, you cannot come with experimental dangerous vaccines,

1650
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:17,960
whether they be safe or not, and they're not, they're deadly, and it's obviously the takeover.

1651
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,040
These people have liability protection, they have long histories of killing people with

1652
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,040
vaccines.

1653
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,360
They are eugenicists that want to depopulate you.

1654
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:27,240
When somebody says, I want to depopulate you, and he's spent hundreds of billions of dollars

1655
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:31,040
he got from big foundations and the robber barons to get control of the world health

1656
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:35,600
system and most nation state systems, he's been thrown out of over 20 countries, Gates,

1657
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,980
has been, he's in another 140 or so.

1658
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,360
Thrown out of 20 countries.

1659
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:43,520
When you've got something of that matter through a plate glass window, and he says he wants

1660
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,000
to do this, and it's what he comes out of, Cold Springs Harbor and the eugenics, and

1661
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:54,720
then he's coming, violating the Geneva convention, violating the Nuremberg code, violating international

1662
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,720
law.

1663
01:13:55,720 --> 01:14:00,000
If the Nazis were coming to give you a deadly shot or take your kids away, you don't just

1664
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,560
have a right, you have a duty to fight them.

1665
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,140
So they've already shut down the communications almost everywhere.

1666
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,140
Now they're coming.

1667
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:10,960
Now they're going to beta test in Canada and Europe in this round and in California and

1668
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,840
in New York, dragging people out of their homes, beating people up that don't wear masks,

1669
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,840
taking people's children away.

1670
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,040
The UN said that was the goal.

1671
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,760
It's already happened in Australia and Spain.

1672
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,600
Now it's happening in England.

1673
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,040
And they're just normalizing that vans come, cops have guns.

1674
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,040
You disappear.

1675
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:30,280
And then again, if they say you have COVID, these are leftist doctors at extermination

1676
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:31,980
centers, not guillotines.

1677
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:33,800
They say, oh, he had COVID.

1678
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,960
And now you're going to see people take it to the COVID centers.

1679
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:38,000
It's already happening in Australia.

1680
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
People die in these.

1681
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,120
You're totally healthy.

1682
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,120
They take you.

1683
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,300
They go, oh, he got sick.

1684
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,680
We had to innovate him.

1685
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,480
And yeah, he died after two weeks on a ventilator.

1686
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:51,880
So they strap you down and the comics Chinese do this and they put it down your lungs and

1687
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,120
they kill you.

1688
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,000
And they sit there and laugh at you while you're dying.

1689
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,600
And they turn it up way higher.

1690
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:00,720
Like a lot of the old folks in the blue city areas where they have these killer eugenics

1691
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,920
doctors, they're, they're, they're in cult bioethics boards, like, like Ezekiel Emanuel

1692
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,460
saying he wants to kill old people.

1693
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,640
He runs this.

1694
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:12,360
He hires for decades, all, all these boards, these are psycho killers.

1695
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:16,960
And even the medical association said, why did you give people twice the pressure you're

1696
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:17,960
supposed to?

1697
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:22,520
And there's like, because they got to get kill numbers.

1698
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:25,280
So they're coming to kill you.

1699
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,800
They're coming to kill you.

1700
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:27,960
They're coming to kill you.

1701
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:31,600
So you kind of, you kind of get what I'm saying.

1702
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:36,160
He starts with the presentation of like, there's a lot of people who are saying, clean off

1703
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,640
your rifles.

1704
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:42,520
And then he gives the appearance of saying that, no, you shouldn't.

1705
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:47,200
And that is good for him because he can sort of point to that as being like, this is me

1706
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,480
pushing back against the idea of offensive violence.

1707
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,480
Totally.

1708
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:55,100
Now the next two minutes is him saying a hundred fucking different things that you can't keep

1709
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:58,560
track of all these various little bullshit pieces.

1710
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,000
No, Ezekiel Emanuel wants to kill everybody.

1711
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Totally.

1712
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Yeah.

1713
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Cult, cult leftist doctors.

1714
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Bioethics boards.

1715
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Psycho killers.

1716
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,520
Do cults create bioethics boards?

1717
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,840
Is that a thing I didn't know about?

1718
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,200
That's what the new Assassin's Creed is actually about.

1719
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,440
God damn Templars.

1720
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:18,160
And then it gets to the end and the message that he's trying to drive home is they're

1721
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,200
coming to kill you.

1722
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,200
They're coming to kill you.

1723
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,960
They're coming to kill you.

1724
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:25,720
This is the answer to the beginning of it.

1725
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:31,120
This is him saying, there is no such thing as offensive violence now.

1726
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,160
It's not a question of that.

1727
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:37,280
Like existentially, this isn't even a question we need to worry about.

1728
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,760
All violence is defensive.

1729
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:39,760
You got it.

1730
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:44,520
But he doesn't need to actually say that if he structures the argument this way.

1731
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:50,400
And if anybody tries to say like, Alex, you're advocating for people to dust off their rifles

1732
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:55,840
and fire at people if they feel like they're vaccine pushers.

1733
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,440
A bioethics board is coming for them.

1734
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:01,040
Or someone is telling you to wear a mask.

1735
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,040
They're trying to get you to...

1736
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:05,120
Offensive violence, so anything you do to that person is defensive.

1737
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,200
And if anybody tries to say that Alex, this is what you're saying, he can point to like,

1738
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:13,160
I said that there's a lot of people who are saying clean off the rifles and I was pushing

1739
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,720
back against that idea.

1740
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,420
Alex, you are one of them.

1741
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:17,420
You just did it.

1742
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:20,800
The larger context of it is the coward's way of saying exactly that.

1743
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,800
Just shoot people.

1744
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,160
There's no such thing as offensive violence.

1745
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:28,880
But if you do commit one of those crimes, I will say that it's a leftist who did it.

1746
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,920
And that it was offensive.

1747
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:36,000
And then they also handed me a fucking book with a Nazi book market and followed me from

1748
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Florida.

1749
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Yeah.

1750
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Jesus Christ.

1751
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Yeah.

1752
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,880
So in this next clip, Alex talks about a conspiracy that I'd like to see him substantiate at all.

1753
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:49,840
And the police come and say, you're not allowed to criticize the lockdown and arrest them

1754
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,840
and disappear them.

1755
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:54,360
And by the way, a lot of these people, we need to try to get them on Daria.

1756
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:59,840
Remember that Swedish couple was panicking and they come and she was organizing a demonstration

1757
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,800
and they arrested her husband.

1758
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:02,800
They'd never been seen again.

1759
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:06,200
Last time I heard check on them, same thing in Australia.

1760
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,200
They've disappeared.

1761
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:11,600
Thousands of people, members of city councils that said, no, we're taking a military base.

1762
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,440
Some were never seen again.

1763
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,440
What?

1764
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,960
There's a big difference between you not checking.

1765
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,280
This is what I'm saying.

1766
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,280
This is object permanence.

1767
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,280
Yes.

1768
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:23,600
If they still existed, we would have heard about them in the news again.

1769
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,600
Yeah.

1770
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,600
Since we haven't heard about them in the news.

1771
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,600
They've never been seen.

1772
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,600
They've been killed.

1773
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,600
They've been disappeared.

1774
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:29,960
That's the explanation.

1775
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:30,960
Yeah.

1776
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:34,520
That's really sloppy.

1777
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,520
That's all it takes.

1778
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,520
Yeah.

1779
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,520
That's all it takes.

1780
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,520
I would assume.

1781
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:42,440
I have not seen my delivery driver for the Chinese food that I got last night for 24

1782
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,440
hours.

1783
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:44,880
And I'm thinking about filing a missing person.

1784
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,760
That's scary.

1785
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:52,520
I would assume that if city council members were being disappeared, there would be openings

1786
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,400
on city councils that were very suspicious.

1787
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,040
We would at least have elections.

1788
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,040
We'd have a runoff.

1789
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,040
Why?

1790
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,040
Because we elected somebody.

1791
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,040
Oh, somebody disappeared.

1792
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,040
Don't worry about it.

1793
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,040
Okay.

1794
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:06,800
Would you update their Wikipedia page?

1795
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,040
One thing that would happen there is paperwork.

1796
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,040
Sure.

1797
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,040
Yeah, definitely.

1798
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,040
You'd be able to point to something.

1799
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,040
Definitely.

1800
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,040
There would be paperwork.

1801
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,880
Conspicuous in its absence from any of this is any proof.

1802
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:22,120
And when Alex says there's this Swedish couple, they've never been seen again.

1803
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:24,320
We should look into them.

1804
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,520
Like that tells me you haven't.

1805
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,520
Yeah.

1806
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,520
And you're making that up.

1807
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:28,520
Would you say it?

1808
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,520
Yeah.

1809
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,520
So Alex goes to calls.

1810
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,120
He takes some calls.

1811
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,840
And one of them he offers a job to.

1812
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,560
And this guy is somebody who he'd previously offered a job to.

1813
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:43,360
And he's like, hey, you said give me a half hour show or something.

1814
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:47,640
And Alex is like, oh, yeah, man, we're going to start that up soon.

1815
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:51,480
He's still planning on starting that show with callers up soon.

1816
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:55,800
But yeah, so here's what this caller's theory is about what the Dems are up to.

1817
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:59,280
I feel like the left is winding up their people.

1818
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:03,880
They projected this win so that when Trump does win on the day of the eclipse with December

1819
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:07,720
14th, when it all gets sorted out, I feel like this is going to create bedlam in the

1820
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:08,720
streets.

1821
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:12,480
And that's why I feel like they're going right into the COVID news now to create a lockdown

1822
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:16,440
scenario and all those leftist areas to lock those people down, to suppress them even more,

1823
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:19,960
so that they go crazy when Trump wins to really stoke this civil war.

1824
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:24,320
And I feel like that's that's really what they set up so that I totally agree with you.

1825
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,320
I totally agree with you, sir.

1826
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,320
What else do you think's coming?

1827
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:29,720
I feel like what you were saying about the bio attack thing.

1828
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:34,240
I feel like just just going with God here and looking at the alignment and God's handiwork

1829
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,240
here.

1830
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,000
Just there's a great conjunction on December 21st.

1831
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,560
Oh, my an apocalypse.

1832
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,560
Wow.

1833
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:40,560
It's back.

1834
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,560
I'm sick of conjunctions.

1835
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,720
Eight years later, it's back sick of conjunctions.

1836
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:47,620
So that eclipse that's happening on December 14th isn't going to be visible in any part

1837
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:51,340
of North America, but they will be able to feel it.

1838
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:56,840
It's only going to be seen in South America, parts of northern Antarctica and some of southwest

1839
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:57,840
Africa.

1840
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,300
I have no idea why that would be significant in the United States, but go off, whatever.

1841
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,760
It's an eclipse.

1842
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,200
Eclipses are global events, Dan.

1843
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,400
It's the sun and the moon and they're doing a whole thing.

1844
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,720
They're spinning all the time.

1845
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:14,640
I grow weary of these sorts of ideas being brought to Alex's attention and being like,

1846
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,640
I fucking agree.

1847
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:16,640
I fucking love it.

1848
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:17,640
Totally agree.

1849
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,640
I'm right.

1850
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,600
They're knocking leftists down to whip them up into a frenzy.

1851
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,580
So whenever Trump definitely doesn't steal the election and wins it outright, they'll

1852
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:28,880
be whipped into an insane frenzy and start the civil war.

1853
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,040
And they knew that all of this.

1854
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,040
They knew all of it.

1855
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:35,080
They knew they had to do all of this right now because the stars are aligning and there's

1856
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,720
an eclipse on December 14th.

1857
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:39,600
It's the eclipse.

1858
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,600
They got to do it.

1859
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,560
You know what I grow weary of?

1860
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:46,800
Anybody who dares take this shit seriously.

1861
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,320
Anybody who has the pretense of like, no, he actually has some really good ideas.

1862
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,720
He's really, he's right about more than he's wrong about.

1863
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:53,720
Yeah.

1864
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:54,720
Go fuck yourself.

1865
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:55,720
Fuck yourself.

1866
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:56,720
You never listen to this show.

1867
01:21:56,720 --> 01:22:00,480
If you listen to this shit, you'd be like, Oh, God damn it.

1868
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,480
Anybody, anybody.

1869
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:02,880
I challenge them.

1870
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,000
If they think that Alex is more right than he's wrong.

1871
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
No kidding.

1872
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Explain away.

1873
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:13,760
Tell me, tell me about how eclipses are part of the fucking plan.

1874
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,880
And every civilization's ended because of priests eating people.

1875
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:17,880
Yeah.

1876
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:18,880
In only a hundred years.

1877
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:19,880
Yeah.

1878
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:20,880
And all of the people are dead.

1879
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,360
To be fair, sometimes it was like a hundred years.

1880
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,360
Okay.

1881
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,360
There's different time frames.

1882
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,360
Sure.

1883
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,400
But it always ends up with a human barbecue.

1884
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,160
Every civilization that's turned its back to Christ, Dan.

1885
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,160
Totally.

1886
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,160
It falls apart.

1887
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,160
Yep.

1888
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:38,080
So instead of just handing off the baton to Harrison Smith on this episode, Alex has

1889
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:43,480
a little bit of a fancy maneuver and that is he has Ezra Levant from Rebel Media come

1890
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:47,480
on to host for a couple of segments and then Harrison takes over.

1891
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:48,480
Nice.

1892
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,480
So Alex still gets to leave early.

1893
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:50,480
Nicely done.

1894
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,120
Ezra Levant is coming up very excited.

1895
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:55,680
I'm going to interview him for a segment that I'm, he's a great talk show host, his own

1896
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:56,680
right with Rebel Media.

1897
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:00,760
He's going to take over two segments and then we're going to have Harrison Smith and Owen

1898
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:03,400
Schroyer hosting from DC.

1899
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,960
Harrison's back in Austin, Texas.

1900
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,040
The interview is not very interesting at all.

1901
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,520
And the only other clip Alex has on this show before he leaves, I think is interesting in

1902
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,640
any way as this.

1903
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:16,080
But man, I, let me tell you, Trump won on a landslide.

1904
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:20,080
Everyone I know believes Trump won black, white, Hispanic, old, young.

1905
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,680
I mean, it's like 60% support Trump.

1906
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,640
Everybody knew Trump was working his ass off.

1907
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:32,280
No one votes for that dead zombie Biden and Kamala that had half a percent support Democrats.

1908
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,280
Everyone hates them.

1909
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,280
That's why the globalist chose them because they're such weak puppets.

1910
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,540
They can control them.

1911
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,640
So I think we have 60%.

1912
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:43,840
It's just, we have to convince ourselves that we are the majority and start not complying.

1913
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:49,480
This is in reference to a caller who's like 3% in polls believe Trump won the election.

1914
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,480
Yeah.

1915
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,880
Alex is like, I think we got 60.

1916
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,440
I think it's a hundred percent.

1917
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:54,440
Yeah.

1918
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:55,440
Oh Jesus.

1919
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,620
So, um, he talks to Ezra Levant.

1920
01:23:57,620 --> 01:24:00,360
It's un-consequential and then the show wraps up.

1921
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:07,160
I think what, what frustrates me the most is that the principle reason that Alex and

1922
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:11,000
the conservatives like Trump is because he's a dick to libs.

1923
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Yeah.

1924
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,160
Lib tears.

1925
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:17,880
Did it never occur to you that that would motivate libs?

1926
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:18,880
Right?

1927
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:19,880
Uh, yeah.

1928
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,800
Like say, say, okay, fine.

1929
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,040
Say that nobody's voting for Biden.

1930
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:30,520
The principle factor of your guy is making a lot of people hate him.

1931
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,520
Yeah.

1932
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:32,520
Yeah.

1933
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,520
That's motivating.

1934
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:39,240
And then when you add on like the existential danger that he presents to vulnerable populations,

1935
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:43,160
you can probably galvanize quite a bit of support that way as well.

1936
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,160
Yeah.

1937
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,160
Uh, yeah.

1938
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,160
It's all just dumb.

1939
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,160
Yeah.

1940
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:51,900
Anyway, on Friday the convoy arrived in DC and at that point it's really kind of pointless

1941
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:54,280
to discuss it as it being its own thing anymore.

1942
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,280
Yeah.

1943
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:58,200
From that point on the caravan just became another group of participants in the larger

1944
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,680
very sad display in DC.

1945
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:04,880
Here's a little clip of Owen, uh, I guess this is their point now.

1946
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:05,880
Okay.

1947
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:06,880
Yeah.

1948
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:07,880
I've been trying out a new chant actually on this road trip.

1949
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:08,880
You guys want to try this with me?

1950
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:09,880
I think everybody agrees with this.

1951
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:10,880
I'm not sure.

1952
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:11,880
So if you, if you don't agree with this, you can just hang your head.

1953
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:12,880
Government sucks.

1954
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:13,880
Government sucks.

1955
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:14,880
Government sucks.

1956
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,880
Government sucks.

1957
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:16,880
Government sucks.

1958
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:17,880
Government sucks.

1959
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:18,880
Government sucks.

1960
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:19,880
Government sucks.

1961
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:20,880
Government sucks.

1962
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:21,880
Government sucks.

1963
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:22,880
Government sucks.

1964
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:29,880
I don't know what they're doing.

1965
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:30,880
Oh man.

1966
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:31,880
I don't.

1967
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:32,880
Oh God.

1968
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:33,880
Yes.

1969
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:40,040
We've been wildly obsessed with electoral politics for the last little while and yet

1970
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:45,880
here we are trying to overturn an election while yelling government sucks.

1971
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:51,920
I just, I just, you guys don't understand anything.

1972
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,240
Well, I mean, if you want to be anarchist, go for it.

1973
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,240
No, of course.

1974
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:57,240
But don't do that.

1975
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,240
But they don't want to be anarchists.

1976
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,240
They hate anarchists.

1977
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:00,240
God.

1978
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,240
I hate these people.

1979
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,240
Yeah.

1980
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:07,320
A government that is not fully in line with exactly what we want in a way that represses

1981
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,440
the people we don't like sucks.

1982
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,440
That's the real chant.

1983
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,440
Non-nazis suck.

1984
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:12,440
Yes.

1985
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:13,440
Non-nazis suck.

1986
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:19,320
On the one hand, it's only fair that I congratulate Owen for being able to get to DC theoretically

1987
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,320
on time.

1988
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,320
Lost me 50 bucks.

1989
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:25,540
In hindsight, this was a miscalculation on my part because I thought that they were actually

1990
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:30,120
planning to do things in the cities that they went to, not just drop in on ongoing rallies

1991
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:32,700
for about 15 minutes before leaving.

1992
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:36,020
They were able to achieve their goals on their trip because they had no goals.

1993
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:38,680
So I guess I just overestimated the project.

1994
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:44,160
You put together that time schedule where I was like, yeah, I would say two hours is

1995
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,320
about right for a rally.

1996
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,840
You know, you're going to go do some glad-handing.

1997
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,120
Maybe you want to see something in the town too.

1998
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,120
Totally.

1999
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,600
Like it's awesome to go around America.

2000
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,840
Maybe you go like, and I know from the times that I've been on the road, like there's just

2001
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:58,840
unexpected shit.

2002
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,680
Like you might have to take a shit.

2003
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:05,920
You might have to pull over at a rest stop for a couple minutes and sometimes you might

2004
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,120
get lost.

2005
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:12,440
How many times have you been on the road and been like, we're 10 minutes, we're 15 minutes

2006
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,440
off track.

2007
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,440
It's the doubling back.

2008
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,440
Now you've lost half an hour.

2009
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:16,440
It's the best.

2010
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,440
Yeah.

2011
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,440
It's the best.

2012
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:19,440
You might even stop and see the world's largest blank.

2013
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,600
It's the best.

2014
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:24,160
I think that they probably weren't on time for most of it, but they did end up pulling

2015
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,140
it off and the trip ended up.

2016
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,840
So like, congratulations.

2017
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,400
I mean, but they set the bar so low for success.

2018
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,560
I had more ambition for them than they did.

2019
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:34,560
Of course we did.

2020
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:35,560
Of course we did.

2021
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,560
That's kind of sad.

2022
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,560
This is why we're here.

2023
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:38,560
Yeah.

2024
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,880
With that congratulation out of the way, I have to say that this was one of the most

2025
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:45,520
pathetic, dismal, embarrassing, and childish weekends I've ever seen in this country.

2026
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:50,100
The prelude of Alex's completely pointless and poorly attended caravan tour is what made

2027
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:54,440
me pay closer attention, but if not for that aspect, I think I might have given this entire

2028
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:58,000
million MAGA march nonsense a pass in terms of attention.

2029
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Fuck it.

2030
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,320
The turnout on Saturday was in the tens of thousands, but nowhere near their goal of

2031
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:08,560
a million people, and well below the 400,000 plus who came to DC for the 2017 Women's March.

2032
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,840
It doesn't even come close to the turnout for Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert's rally

2033
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:15,640
to restore sanity and or fear back in 2010.

2034
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:20,840
There are two pieces of the puzzle here that are important to recognize are both true and

2035
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,520
seem at odds with each other, but are not.

2036
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:26,360
The first is that this rally was a horrible failure.

2037
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:29,920
The turnout wasn't even close to what the organizers and propagandists like Alex would

2038
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,720
have wanted, having built this up as their last fight for the country.

2039
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:37,820
The fact that they did a poorly attended caravan leading up to the march only serves to highlight

2040
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:41,760
how thin the support for their cause is in other cities around the country, even in the

2041
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:44,120
more conservative leaning south.

2042
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:47,960
Their attempt at creating optics of the country speaking out in support of Trump has really

2043
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:51,640
only proven that their best shot isn't even a fraction of the people who will come out

2044
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:55,680
to support reproductive rights or civil rights protections.

2045
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:59,320
There's gonna be excuses for the small turnout, and there'll be pictures that do look like

2046
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:02,120
million people, but they're far less.

2047
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:05,100
There have already been a ton of attempts to use pictures from the Women's March or

2048
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:08,800
the March for Our Lives protests, which have been erroneously claimed to have been from

2049
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:09,800
this weekend.

2050
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:10,800
Naturally.

2051
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,720
There have also been edited videos of Trump supporters being attacked, where the context

2052
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:16,580
of them initiating the violence was left out.

2053
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:20,940
These will be the attempts to salvage what the Trump scammers can from this utter failure

2054
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:22,540
of a rally.

2055
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:26,420
The second piece of the puzzle is that the turnout was still way too high.

2056
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:29,880
And that's because this rally was explicitly radical.

2057
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:34,040
This was not a political rally, in the sense that like a march supporting the Second Amendment

2058
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:36,720
or a march protesting a tax hike might be.

2059
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:40,200
The only reason this rally was happening is that these people decided to show up to say

2060
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:43,680
they don't want to follow the rules of the country anymore.

2061
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:47,960
Whenever there's a new president elected, the side that doesn't win will often hold

2062
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:52,120
demonstrations, and you're likely to hear people chanting stuff like, not my president,

2063
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:56,120
and I bet you could find small pockets of people in those protests who insist the election

2064
01:29:56,120 --> 01:30:00,180
itself was invalid and the results aren't real.

2065
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:04,240
This weekend's rally was an entire rally that just consisted of that small pocket, which

2066
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:07,140
is now, I guess, the right wing.

2067
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:10,180
This rally was a collection of really fucked up weirdos.

2068
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:14,800
Alex Jones had the Proud Boys giving him security, apparently one of whom had a Pinochet did

2069
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,520
nothing wrong shirt on.

2070
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:20,480
The Oath Keepers may or may not have had men stationed around the city in case shit got

2071
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:21,480
hot.

2072
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:22,480
Great.

2073
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:26,920
Nick Fuentes and his grippers walked around as completely normal participants in the affair.

2074
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:28,680
QAnon weirdos were all around.

2075
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:29,680
Naturally.

2076
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:35,500
This seeming contradiction is the same thing that haunted every stop on the caravan.

2077
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:39,800
In every city, the turnout they got was minuscule compared to the way they present their audience.

2078
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:44,320
Every event they held would be considered a flop by anyone who seriously had the self-image

2079
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,860
that they do.

2080
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:48,680
But they don't mean it when they describe how popular they are.

2081
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,240
It's kind of a joke.

2082
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:55,200
They know they're lying, just like Alex does when he says there were 400 cars in the caravan.

2083
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,600
That's a lie for the benefit of the listener in the middle of nowhere who thinks they're

2084
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:02,680
hearing dispatches from the front line, not realizing that they're being deceived to sell

2085
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:03,680
them pills.

2086
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:08,080
They don't care that there's no one at the actual rally, because on some level everyone

2087
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:13,320
at Infos has to know that in a sane world, no one would show up at their rallies.

2088
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:17,000
Nine people showing up to send them off in Austin is more than they deserve, based on

2089
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,880
their credibility, work ethic, and integrity.

2090
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:20,880
Indeed.

2091
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,340
This is the same dynamic at the DC rally.

2092
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:27,440
The turnout is a disaster, if you're looking at it as a sincere attempt at a political

2093
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,440
rally.

2094
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:32,040
If you're looking at it for what it is, which is a collection of people living in a completely

2095
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:37,680
fractured reality that's at odds with our reality and sees our reality as hostile, then

2096
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:40,480
the turnout should be terrifying in a wake-up call.

2097
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:45,100
Any event that would allow people like Nick Fuentes and Alex Jones to speak on their stages

2098
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:49,240
is not a political event, and I worry that some people there, or some people who might

2099
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:53,200
have seen coverage of the rally, they might not understand that dynamic, and how extreme

2100
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,960
the stuff they're seeing actually is.

2101
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:59,540
I don't know what to think about what the future holds, but I do have a couple of main

2102
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:01,780
thoughts that came up.

2103
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:05,520
The first is that Alex's messaging to his audience is completely out of sync with his

2104
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,160
public behavior.

2105
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:11,280
In this period where he's going to DC and joining in this rally that's trying to reinstall

2106
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:15,400
Trump as the president of the country, he's simultaneously telling his audience that there's

2107
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:19,240
no hope and everyone's gonna die, so everyone needs to head to the hills.

2108
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:22,760
This messaging is discordant, and it kind of gives you the impression that his primary

2109
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:27,160
focus is attention-seeking behavior and selling survival food buckets.

2110
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:31,760
The second is that we are about to be entering a period where fantasies and alternative realities

2111
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:36,240
on the extreme right are going to be coming into large-scale conflict with what I'm going

2112
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,160
to call reality.

2113
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:42,440
As more and more excuses for why these fantasies aren't coming true become unconvincing, the

2114
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:44,840
need to escalate will be ever-present.

2115
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:49,300
Whereas before, in his earlier career, Alex could justify his conspiracies by pointing

2116
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:53,760
to the Federal Reserve, now in the era of Trump, in order to make anything he's saying

2117
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:58,360
make sense, he needs to evoke the literal devil, end-times prophecies, outrageously

2118
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:02,860
complicated and nonsensical conspiracies, and insistences that everyone he doesn't like

2119
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:04,820
is a pedophile.

2120
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:09,560
Without strong forces pushing in the opposite direction, this road only leads to deeper

2121
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:10,560
extremism.

2122
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,720
There's no point where someone like Alex will be like, all right, good job, we achieved

2123
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,080
our goals.

2124
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:20,040
If he ever reached his impossible-to-attain goal of eliminating all the globalists, I

2125
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:24,340
would bet everything that I own that he'd magically find a new sect of neo-globalists

2126
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:28,240
and just knock me down with a feather, they all happen to not be white.

2127
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:31,680
What I'm saying is, I'm worried.

2128
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:39,200
Well, I mean, extremism on the right has always been there, obviously, they're the right,

2129
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,840
that's kind of their position.

2130
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:48,760
But in electoral politics, you used to be able to give them a bone, like, oh, George

2131
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:52,360
W. Bush lowered the marginal tax rate.

2132
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:55,780
That's like a little pressure valve.

2133
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:57,240
We gotta win.

2134
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:01,520
The president gave us something, we elected him, and we got the win that we were looking

2135
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:02,520
for.

2136
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:10,160
Now, all of the wins that they want are either imaginary, and so cannot be achieved, or impossible,

2137
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:15,760
and so also cannot be achieved, or we'll kill everyone, so hopefully will not be achieved.

2138
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:18,680
Well, even the imaginary- So there's no pressure valve, you know, other

2139
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:20,480
than violence, really.

2140
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:25,200
The imaginary and the impossible ones, the practical real-world versions of them are

2141
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:29,680
exactly what it would look like if someone were taking authoritarian rule.

2142
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:30,680
Exactly.

2143
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:37,680
It would be like the prosecution, targeted prosecution of the leadership of the opposition

2144
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:38,680
party.

2145
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:39,680
Totally.

2146
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:40,680
Yeah, we want Hillary to go to prison.

2147
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:41,680
That's not going to happen, guys.

2148
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:42,680
Right, yeah, yeah.

2149
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:47,880
The real-world version of any kind of thing that would be like, ah, yes, we've gotten

2150
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:50,000
what we want, would be-

2151
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,860
Public execution, you know?

2152
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:56,920
So it's like, there's no pressure release valve.

2153
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:05,280
And if Trump, if the right hadn't have weaponized imagination, then they could have been like,

2154
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:10,760
oh, well, Trump put up fucking, he dropped environmental protection, so we win.

2155
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:14,480
But nobody gives a shit about that on the right, they just want fucking murder.

2156
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:18,320
If Alex wants to try and continue his brain, he should just be focusing on the fact that

2157
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:23,160
Trump got out of the TPP, or whatever, and stay on that talking point and be like, let's

2158
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:24,160
build from there.

2159
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,160
But he can't.

2160
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:30,440
And your messaging on the right was never economic anxiety, it used to come off that

2161
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:32,080
way, but now it's just full-on racism.

2162
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:37,200
So you can't even be like, oh, well, we got out of the TPP because of economic anxiety

2163
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,200
or anything like that.

2164
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:39,200
It's like-

2165
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,200
Well, you might want to tell the Times that.

2166
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,200
Yeah.

2167
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:51,760
I think that it's really worrisome, just the rally itself in DC was worrying.

2168
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:56,880
This is an attempt to take over fully the GOP, with these scam artists, these Trump

2169
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:57,880
scam folk.

2170
01:35:57,880 --> 01:35:58,880
Yep.

2171
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,120
And I think that's probably wise of them, I think it's the only thing they can do.

2172
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:03,640
It's their best shot now.

2173
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:04,640
Yeah.

2174
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:09,480
Although they'll end up in a turf war with QAnon soon enough, and then they'll fracture

2175
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:13,500
the party and then Democrats will win every election moving forward.

2176
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:21,640
That's probably our, the most likely outcome of that in the long term is they will eventually

2177
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:22,640
kill each other.

2178
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:24,520
They'll destroy themselves from within.

2179
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,680
Or at least diminish their own electoral power.

2180
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:27,920
Sure, sure, sure.

2181
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,320
But I meant metaphysically, metaphorically, not, you know.

2182
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:35,540
But that's like the long term.

2183
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:37,360
The short term is fucked up shit.

2184
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,360
Yes, yes it is.

2185
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:39,360
It's always fucked up shit.

2186
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,360
Yes it is.

2187
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:41,360
And it's very scary.

2188
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,360
Fuck.

2189
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:43,360
Yep.

2190
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,360
Oh, well.

2191
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:45,360
Anyway.

2192
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:46,360
Hey!

2193
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:50,200
Much like everything on Knowledge Fight, this Caravanity project has started fun and

2194
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:52,080
ended up depressing.

2195
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,080
So great.

2196
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:57,320
The good news is, though, in South Carolina they did find a homeless man with a computer

2197
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:59,960
chip in his hand, but they couldn't get footage of it.

2198
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,560
He gave him that Nazi book.

2199
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,000
Exactly, there's the problem.

2200
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,160
That's what happened.

2201
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,680
So I resent this so much.

2202
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:10,160
They ruin my fun.

2203
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:11,160
I just-

2204
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:12,160
Wanna have fun!

2205
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:14,600
They just don't understand how to do anything.

2206
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:15,600
Yeah.

2207
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,600
Anything.

2208
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:19,820
How much fun would it be if one of the videos is just like, Owen being like, alright, we're

2209
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:23,720
gonna go to this North Carolina, we're gonna go to this Raleigh event, but you know what?

2210
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:27,320
While we're in town, I'm gonna try and find the best hot dog.

2211
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:28,320
Totally!

2212
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,320
Something!

2213
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:30,320
Anything!

2214
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,320
Something!

2215
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,760
Some personality other than we're angry.

2216
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:34,760
Yeah, yeah.

2217
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:35,760
Wham!

2218
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,320
We're angry and we're sensitive.

2219
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:38,320
Yeah.

2220
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,320
That's it.

2221
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:42,760
Like we're angry and we're like, please don't hit us with milkshakes, god damn it.

2222
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:43,760
You gotta suck.

2223
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,480
Gotta hit the car wash.

2224
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:46,480
Yeah, oh man.

2225
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:49,920
Anyway, thank you all for joining us on this Care of Vanity project.

2226
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,160
Yes, indeed.

2227
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:55,920
I think that I need a day off, and so I think we will be back at the end of the week.

2228
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:56,920
Yes.

2229
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:57,920
I think we'll have an episode on Friday this week.

2230
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,360
I believe so, yeah.

2231
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:04,520
Because I also just don't think that Alex is gonna be, like, back to putting out some

2232
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:08,720
content that I can cover in time for Wednesday's episode or anything.

2233
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:09,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2234
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:14,380
And I don't wanna, look, sorry guys, everybody out there, sorry, I don't wanna cover Alex

2235
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:15,380
going on Tim Pool.

2236
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:16,380
Yeah!

2237
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:17,380
I don't wanna cover.

2238
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:22,440
I don't respect Tim Pool enough to deconstruct an episode of his squirrely ass.

2239
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:26,680
Plenty of people told me that Alex was on Tim Pool and I was like, who the fuck is Tim

2240
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:28,720
Pool and why would I give a shit?

2241
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:29,720
Yeah.

2242
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:36,880
He's somewhat relevant to the worlds that we cover, but I just, I find him so insufferable.

2243
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,280
Yeah.

2244
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,800
And also he seems like somebody who might bother me.

2245
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:41,800
What type of douchebag is he?

2246
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,440
He seems like the kind of guy who might email me.

2247
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,440
Oh, who's gonna try and fuck you.

2248
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:45,440
If we do an episode about him.

2249
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:46,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2250
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,440
And I just don't even wanna deal with that.

2251
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:48,440
Okay.

2252
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:52,880
I don't wanna wake up some day and see a notification to Tim Pool wants to debate or something.

2253
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:56,280
I just don't wanna do it.

2254
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:57,960
So yeah, I don't know, I don't think I'm gonna do that.

2255
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:01,400
But maybe sometime in the future, maybe as sort of a look back thing, but there's no

2256
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,400
immediacy.

2257
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,960
I have no interest in covering it the same way we might cover Rogan.

2258
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:06,960
Yeah.

2259
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,360
Anyway, we'll be back at the end of the week, but until then we have a website.

2260
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,960
We do have a website, it's knowledgefight.com.

2261
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,920
Yes, we're also on Twitter.

2262
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:14,760
We are on Twitter.

2263
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:16,800
It's at Knowledge Underscore Fight and I go do Ben Jordan.

2264
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:17,880
Yep, we're on Facebook.

2265
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:18,880
We are on Facebook!

2266
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,240
It's a dollar show, right?

2267
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:21,240
Revive to use this.

2268
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:24,600
And if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

2269
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:25,600
doing God's work.

2270
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:26,600
Yep, we'll be back.

2271
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:30,240
But until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX Clark, I'm Daryl Rundis.

2272
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:34,240
I am that trucker who threw a milkshake at the dude in the caravan.

2273
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:35,600
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air.

2274
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:36,600
Thanks for holding.

2275
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:37,600
Hello, Alex.

2276
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,440
I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan.

2277
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:41,440
I love your work.

2278
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:46,440
I love you.
