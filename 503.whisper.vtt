N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.880 --> 00:17.920
Dan and Jordan, I am SWEATING

00:17.920 --> 00:21.080
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

00:21.080 --> 00:23.760
I have great respect for knowledge fight

00:23.760 --> 00:24.760
knowledge fight

00:24.760 --> 00:27.080
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

00:27.080 --> 00:28.680
saying we are the bad guys

00:28.680 --> 00:30.000
knowledge fight

00:30.000 --> 00:32.120
Dan and Jordan, knowledge fight

00:32.120 --> 00:34.160
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

00:34.160 --> 00:36.440
I need, I need money

00:36.440 --> 00:39.200
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

00:39.200 --> 00:42.120
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and

00:42.120 --> 00:44.600
Stop it, Andy and, Andy and Kansas

00:44.600 --> 00:47.000
Andy and, Andy and, it's time to pray

00:47.000 --> 00:49.160
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

00:49.160 --> 00:51.680
Hello Alex, I'm a 15-color, I'm a huge fan

00:51.680 --> 00:52.800
I love your work

00:56.920 --> 00:59.160
I love you

00:59.160 --> 01:01.160
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

01:01.160 --> 01:01.760
I'm Jordan

01:01.760 --> 01:03.760
We're couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages

01:03.760 --> 01:05.360
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:05.360 --> 01:06.680
Oh indeed we are Dan

01:06.680 --> 01:07.160
Jordan

01:07.160 --> 01:07.760
Dan!

01:07.760 --> 01:08.360
Jordan!

01:08.360 --> 01:08.960
Quick question for you

01:08.960 --> 01:09.440
What's up?

01:09.440 --> 01:10.160
What's your bright spot today?

01:10.160 --> 01:12.160
My bright spot today Jordan is very simple

01:12.160 --> 01:13.160
Vinegar

01:13.160 --> 01:13.920
Vinegar?

01:13.920 --> 01:14.160
Yep

01:14.160 --> 01:14.760
Just vinegar?

01:14.760 --> 01:15.160
Yep

01:15.160 --> 01:15.720
Moving on

01:15.720 --> 01:15.920
Yep

01:15.920 --> 01:16.680
End of podcast

01:16.680 --> 01:18.760
I believe that this segment is called bright spots

01:18.760 --> 01:20.320
not explain your bright spots

01:20.320 --> 01:23.360
That's fair

01:23.360 --> 01:27.000
I've been looking for salad dressing replacements

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I'm trying to eat a little bit better

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
and I accidentally stumbled upon some interesting vinegars

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
like a strawberry rosÃ© vinegar

01:36.000 --> 01:36.800
Interesting

01:36.800 --> 01:38.000
And it's fantastic

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
I will agree that is an interesting vinegar

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Yeah

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Had that on a salad, had it on some chicken

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
and now I've decided that I'm going to explore the wonderful world of vinegar

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Yeah, why not?

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
I didn't realize that there was such a diverse world of weird vinegar products

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
I thought it was just vinegar

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Can you...

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah that makes sense though

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Vinegar isn't like ketchup, it's not just like a thing

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
No, but there are also a bunch of different ketchups

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah, but there's ketchup

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Right

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
You know?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Sure

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
You know what I'm saying?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Not really

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Okay, fair enough

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
There's champagne vinegar in the cabinet that I'm excited to break into

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
I've not tried that yet

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
And then what did I order?

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
I ordered one online that's a chamomile tea vinegar

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
I'm never not going to enjoy your willingness to put both feet in the pond

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
before you have any idea how deep it is

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
The pond is full of vinegar

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
I enjoy it, we'll see what happens

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
It's the vinegar week

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
What about you?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
We're going to do 500 vinegars this week

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
No we're not

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
And we'll get back to the seltzers here soon enough

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Sure, sure

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
My Bright Spot, Dan, is unfortunately also food related

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
But it is also a gratitude towards our listeners related

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Oh that's nice

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
I got that peanut butter for our 500th episode

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
The fog, something in fog

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Fit in fog I think

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Fit in fog, yeah

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I keep saying Phineas in fog but I think that's a Nickelodeon or two

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
That's something else, that's Phineas and Ferb I think

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah something like that

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
And it is excellent

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I bet

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
It is spectacular

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
It's spec-tacular

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
There we go, nicely done

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Thanks

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
No it's just that like, oh shit I forgot what it tastes like when it's made out of real things

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
You know like when you eat Jif you're like this is borderline all sugar and fake peanut

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
It's pronounced gif

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah nicely done

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
That's probably a hacky joke

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
No it's pronounced skippy I think

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Oh

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
That's what I say whenever people say it's Jif

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
I mean what about like a lot of grocery stores they have the things where you just put the peanuts in and grind it up yourself

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Totally, yeah

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Do you ever fuck around with that?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
No, why would I want to work?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Why would I want to work?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Alright

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
I go to the grocery store because I don't have a peanut farm, not because I want to

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Talk to my boy Jim

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I don't want to moonlight as a peanut farm worker

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Talk to my buddy Jim

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Jimmy Carter

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
That's him

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
You know the guy?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
I've heard of him

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Okay

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Well that's good, I'm glad you're enjoying that peanut butter

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yes, thank you very much Bex

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
So Jordan, today we are having a very exciting time here

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yes

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
It is time for the thrilling conclusion

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
The dramatic conclusion

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
To Dan's Caravanity Project 2020

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Now Dan, this is Caravanity Project 2020

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Alright, alright

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
Today we're going to be talking about November 11th, the evening of Wednesday until

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Whenever

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
This weekend's nonsense in DC

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
So we'll see what happens as Owen Schroyer continues on his great big convoy down along

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Oh boy

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
The south and up the eastern seaboard

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Okay, here we go

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
And, yep

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
So we'll get to that here in a minute, but before we do let's take a moment to say thank

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
you to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
So first, John M, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000

Next, Cara M, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm a policy wonk

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Thanks Cara

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Next, Simian M, thank you so much, you are now policy wonk

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I'm a policy wonk

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Thanks Simian

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Oh related

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Next, Gunner D, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
I'm a policy wonk

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Thank you Gunner

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Next, Chris D, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I'm a policy wonk

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Thanks Chris

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Thanks Chris

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Next, Kate

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
No Last Names

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
No Lastgui

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Just Any Kate

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Kate, thank you so much, you are now policy wonk

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
I'm a policy wonk

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Thanks Kate

05:34.000 --> 05:39.840
And, I voted third party in 2016, sorry and never again, you are now a policy wonk.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.840
I'm a policy wonk.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.360
Thank you very much, that stuff.

05:42.360 --> 05:43.360
Yeah.

05:43.360 --> 05:46.200
And finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple folks who donated on Elevated Love

05:46.200 --> 05:47.380
and we appreciate that very much.

05:47.380 --> 05:51.400
So, Kit and Laura from Cincinnati, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.520
Bianca C, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.600
And Evan M, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.920
I'm a policy wonk.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.040
Crikey mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.280
How's your 401k doing, bro?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.880
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright?

06:05.880 --> 06:07.440
Let's just get down to business.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.520
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.440
Why you pimps so good?

06:11.440 --> 06:13.080
My neck is freakishly large.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.840
I declare info war on you.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.840
Thank you so much Kit and Laura out in Cincy.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.200
Yes, thank you very much.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.880
Thank you Bianca and thank you Evan.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.440
Yes, thank you very much, all of you.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.320
If you're out there listening and thinking, hey, I enjoy the show, I'd like to support

06:25.320 --> 06:28.220
what these gents do, you can do that by going to our website, knowledgefights.com, clicking

06:28.220 --> 06:30.360
the button that says support the show, we would appreciate it.

06:30.360 --> 06:31.360
We would love it.

06:31.360 --> 06:38.320
What you could do is you could dip a knife into a big old jar of generosity.

06:38.320 --> 06:44.320
Just dip a knife in there, pull out some crunchy, just creamy generosity, spread it all over

06:44.320 --> 06:47.440
the bagel of a local charity or bail fund in your area.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.320
And top it with some really weird vinegar.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.080
Yeah, absolutely.

06:51.080 --> 06:57.000
So Jordan, I have two out of context drops from today's show, so we'll do one now and

06:57.000 --> 06:59.520
one in a little bit.

06:59.520 --> 07:04.480
I, because I'm a Christian, cannot kill you just because you're stupid.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.480
Fair enough.

07:05.480 --> 07:06.480
Seems good.

07:06.480 --> 07:07.480
Let's see.

07:07.480 --> 07:11.360
I support this prohibition on killing.

07:11.360 --> 07:14.480
Now I'm going back through my Bible to see how many people were killed because they were

07:14.480 --> 07:17.560
stupid and it's a lot, but I don't know if it was post-Christ.

07:17.560 --> 07:20.800
And I don't know if it was specifically only because they were stupid.

07:20.800 --> 07:21.880
Yeah, that's fair.

07:21.880 --> 07:27.380
So Jordan, when we last left off on our previous episode, Owen Schroyer and his merry band

07:27.380 --> 07:32.240
of Shao Kahn impersonators and hippies for Trump were about to roll into Atlanta, Georgia.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.200
That was Wednesday the 11th.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.920
Alex had just wrapped up his show where Steve Pachana came in to claim that whether or not

07:37.920 --> 07:42.720
you believe the 2020 election was a massive sting operation planned in advance to catch

07:42.720 --> 07:47.080
Democrats stealing votes, it's a small detail whether you believe that or not.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.720
What is important is that Trump is going to win and then apparently he's going to get

07:49.720 --> 07:53.040
a third term because these dudes love America.

07:53.040 --> 07:57.160
One thing that's crucially important to understand as we continue exploring this caravan is that

07:57.160 --> 08:02.440
at a certain point it stops being an Infowars caravan and it starts being Infowars within

08:02.440 --> 08:04.280
the larger space.

08:04.280 --> 08:08.120
I'm comfortable judging Owen and Infowars for their crowds in places like Tallahassee

08:08.120 --> 08:13.280
and Baton Rouge because those are specifically Infowars caravan events, or at least appear

08:13.280 --> 08:14.600
to be.

08:14.600 --> 08:18.840
Once they reach Washington DC, they are now becoming part of something larger, which is

08:18.840 --> 08:22.560
the combined work of a network of loosely affiliated grifters.

08:22.560 --> 08:27.400
The plan for the weekend has been for everyone to show up in DC and form the Million Maga

08:27.400 --> 08:28.400
March.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.120
I call it Griftpocalypse.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.400
It's fair.

08:31.400 --> 08:36.600
This effort combines the Infowars caravan with Ali Alexander's Stop the Steal campaign,

08:36.600 --> 08:41.120
as well as Brandon Straca's Walkaway nonsense and whatever the fuck Mike Cernovich is doing

08:41.120 --> 08:42.240
these days.

08:42.240 --> 08:46.720
Beyond that it's attracted the legions of Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, and members of many

08:46.720 --> 08:50.640
right-wing gangs who are less interested in hogging the spotlight.

08:50.640 --> 08:54.800
According to an article from Friday in USA Today, the only group that had a permit for

08:54.800 --> 08:58.640
the event is a group called Women for America First.

08:58.640 --> 09:04.300
Quote, Amy Kramer, chair for Women for America First, said her organization is not coordinating

09:04.300 --> 09:08.120
with any of the other groups planning simultaneous events.

09:08.120 --> 09:11.200
This is really interesting because according to a recent article in Mother Jones, Women

09:11.200 --> 09:18.320
for America First were on one of the main websites for Stop the Steal, www.stolenelection.us.

09:18.320 --> 09:23.400
Donations that people made to Stop the Steal through that website end up going to Women

09:23.400 --> 09:28.000
for America First, and the site was used to promote rallies branded as Stop the Steal.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Great, great.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Anyway, it's a load of bullshit.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Griftpocalypse it is.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.440
Yeah, it's a load of bullshit to pretend these people aren't coordinating.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.940
But that's not even an argument that's really worth having, I think.

09:37.940 --> 09:41.840
The point is that the end result of these rallies will be the combined efforts of a

09:41.840 --> 09:45.000
whole cadre of weirdos.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.500
And so even if we get to the end of this and there is a big turnout in DC, we have to keep

09:49.500 --> 09:53.480
our eyes on the ball and remember that had nothing to do with this stupid road trip.

09:53.480 --> 09:54.960
No, not at all.

09:54.960 --> 09:55.960
Not at all.

09:55.960 --> 10:04.720
It's because fucking evil Steve Bannon, Nick, furied us into the Avengers of Grifters.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.760
More or less.

10:06.760 --> 10:07.760
That's what happened.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.760
So here's our second out of context drop.

10:09.760 --> 10:12.120
We've never lived in more historical times.

10:12.120 --> 10:16.320
This is one of the most historical points in history, except when Jesus Christ was walking

10:16.320 --> 10:17.320
on the earth.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.320
That was more important.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.320
Okay.

10:19.320 --> 10:20.320
All right.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.320
Yikes.

10:21.320 --> 10:27.080
Let's see if we can name other historical figures who have...

10:27.080 --> 10:28.080
Can't do it.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.080
None?

10:29.080 --> 10:30.080
None.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.080
Is just Jesus?

10:31.080 --> 10:32.080
Jesus right now.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.080
Jesus now.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.080
Okay.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.640
He's even saying that 1776 wasn't a big deal.

10:36.640 --> 10:41.600
All right, but what about Genghis Khan when he died an entire empire?

10:41.600 --> 10:42.600
Small potatoes.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.600
Okay.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.600
Fair enough.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.600
Small potatoes.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.600
Fair enough.

10:46.600 --> 10:47.600
Do you see that march in D.C.?

10:47.600 --> 10:48.600
Fuck.

10:48.600 --> 10:55.040
It looked exactly like hundreds of thousands of Mongols riding horseback with their amazing

10:55.040 --> 10:56.040
bows.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.040
That shit was nothing.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.040
Yeah.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.040
Oh, fair enough.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.040
So the 11th November.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.040
Sure.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.040
Owen Troyer arrives in Atlanta.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.040
Owen Troyer here from Infowars.com.

11:03.040 --> 11:14.720
We have just landed in Atlanta, Georgia, and we are on our way right now to the Capitol

11:14.720 --> 11:21.720
building where we have Patriots, Trumps and Mortars, Infowarriors gathered as part of

11:21.720 --> 11:24.160
the Stop the Steel caravan.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.240
There was no reason for me to pull this clip.

11:26.240 --> 11:27.240
Nothing happens in it.

11:27.240 --> 11:32.800
I only decided to start with this because the opening of the video in Atlanta is surreal.

11:32.800 --> 11:36.580
You have Owen Troyer poking his little head out of the sunroof of the Infowars tank with

11:36.580 --> 11:40.320
a handheld mic, talking about how they're heading to the Capitol while driving down

11:40.320 --> 11:42.360
an empty street.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.760
There's no reason for them to choose this presentation.

11:44.760 --> 11:49.080
All it does is make the audio terrible, since even if Owen has a windscreen on his mic,

11:49.080 --> 11:52.480
he's still using a regular microphone while hanging out of a moving vehicle.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.480
It's just very bizarre.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.240
No, it was really easy to understand what he was saying the whole time.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.240
It was infuriating.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.300
No, it was great.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.800
This video's real bad.

11:59.800 --> 12:00.800
No, no, no.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.800
Pop out of there to empty us.

12:01.800 --> 12:02.800
Yeah.

12:02.800 --> 12:03.800
That's what you want.

12:03.800 --> 12:04.800
Empty road.

12:04.800 --> 12:05.800
Yeah.

12:05.800 --> 12:06.800
It's the Stop the Steel caravan, and right now it is very successful.

12:06.800 --> 12:14.280
It looks like we may stop the steel, but we've got to take this thing right to Washington,

12:14.280 --> 12:15.280
D.C.

12:15.280 --> 12:18.560
There's one thing that's suspicious in its absence from this shot of Owen hanging out

12:18.560 --> 12:23.240
the top of the tank, and that's any indication that there are any cars behind him.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.720
You would think that if the caravan is as successful as Owen is claiming, they'd pan

12:26.720 --> 12:31.520
around to show the giant convoy, but nope, just Owen talking to no one, driving down

12:31.520 --> 12:32.520
an empty street.

12:32.520 --> 12:33.520
That's a great metaphor.

12:33.520 --> 12:39.140
You know that I'm Mr. Caravan Fan, Mr. Caravan, if you will, but I found it incredibly challenging

12:39.140 --> 12:44.760
to jump back into this stuff, entirely because how poorly produced this Info Wars video is.

12:44.760 --> 12:49.120
Owen doesn't arrive at the Atlanta rally until eight minutes into the video, and the entire

12:49.120 --> 12:54.000
time up to that point is just him with his head out the sunroof repeatedly saying, Atlanta,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.040
we're in you.

12:56.040 --> 13:02.000
It sounds more like that after the end of a week at camp, they always have the slideshow

13:02.000 --> 13:07.520
with the... There's always a clip of somebody being like, and that's why we love camp, and

13:07.520 --> 13:11.240
when there's swelling music around it, everybody's like, yeah, that's great, but if it was just

13:11.240 --> 13:15.760
him silent to emptiness, you'd be like, this is a bad camp.

13:15.760 --> 13:23.600
If I went to that camp, I'd probably be into a well-made version of Memories from Camp.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.600
Sure.

13:24.600 --> 13:28.240
I still wouldn't be into it if it was poorly made, and that's how I feel about this.

13:28.240 --> 13:32.520
Even if I were into Info Wars and I thought Owen was cool, I'd still be like, guy's got

13:32.520 --> 13:33.520
to do better than this.

13:33.520 --> 13:38.760
This is eight minutes of Owen saying nothing, hanging out the roof of a tank.

13:38.760 --> 13:39.760
This sucks.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.640
It's like the worst version of Mission Impossible.

13:42.640 --> 13:43.640
I don't understand.

13:43.640 --> 13:46.920
They didn't need to keep it for time or anything.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.560
There's no reason for this to be in there.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.420
It's so distractingly bad.

13:50.420 --> 13:51.420
It's just hubris.

13:51.420 --> 13:52.520
I think it's just hubris.

13:52.520 --> 13:56.460
They just think any idea is the best idea at the time.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.560
Their attention span is nothing.

13:57.560 --> 14:01.700
Well, I would argue that it's more likely that they think that there's something badass

14:01.700 --> 14:07.280
about him driving around out the sunroof, and I would argue it does not look that badass.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.280
No.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.880
It kind of looks just like, I mean, it looks fun-ish.

14:10.880 --> 14:11.880
Eh.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.040
You got wind in your hair.

14:13.040 --> 14:15.280
Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters one time.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.280
It was great.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.280
Sure.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.280
I don't know.

14:18.280 --> 14:21.160
It made this a chore.

14:21.160 --> 14:26.160
So on his way, I mean, whether or not he's badass or not, leaning out the roof of this

14:26.160 --> 14:34.300
here tank, he does end up at a stoplight, and there's a guy at the stoplight.

14:34.300 --> 14:41.760
There's something so fucked up and, like, immediately deflating about a tank at a stoplight.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.760
It's pretty sad.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.800
How dare you be stopped by light?

14:44.800 --> 14:47.400
You're a fucking tank.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.400
Leading a convoy.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.400
Yeah, that's weak shit.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.400
No.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.400
Get the fuck out of here.

14:51.400 --> 14:55.520
Well, he obeys traffic laws, and he tries to do a little bit of, just do a little crowd

14:55.520 --> 14:58.920
work with the guy who's standing, waiting to cross the street.

14:58.920 --> 15:02.080
And so that's our plan, and that's why we're in Atlanta here today.

15:02.080 --> 15:05.080
How are you doing, sir?

15:05.080 --> 15:07.080
Me too.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.080
Me too.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.080
Atlanta.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.080
Atlanta.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.080
We are here.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.080
Stop.

15:14.080 --> 15:20.560
The steel caravan has arrived.

15:20.560 --> 15:26.480
Hey, how far out are we?

15:26.480 --> 15:27.920
Less than a mile.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.480
They are out of gas.

15:29.480 --> 15:33.440
There is no enthusiasm left in this fucking thing at all.

15:33.440 --> 15:38.600
I am trying really hard to stay excited about this, and they're not doing it.

15:38.600 --> 15:39.600
They're bored.

15:39.600 --> 15:40.600
Yes.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.160
They realized a couple of days in it was a terrible idea.

15:43.160 --> 15:44.160
Yes.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.160
They're not having fun.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.160
We went to Baton Rouge.

15:46.160 --> 15:49.000
We drove seven fucking hours, and there were ten people there.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
What are we doing?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
There's nobody there.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Sucks.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Oh, man.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
So Owen thinks-

15:54.000 --> 15:55.200
See, this is when you want to be on the RV.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.200
Yes.

15:56.200 --> 16:00.640
This is when you want to be getting the conversations and bird's eye view just right there.

16:00.640 --> 16:01.680
Beautiful.

16:01.680 --> 16:07.200
So Owen thinks he's funny, and so he has a bit that he wants to do.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.640
And this is like, I mean, I guess this is exactly how comedians do it.

16:10.640 --> 16:13.360
You polish things up at open mics before you try it on a real crowd.

16:13.360 --> 16:14.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:14.360 --> 16:15.360
No, no, that makes sense.

16:15.360 --> 16:19.960
And for Owen, the open mic is sticking his head out the top of a car while no one's listening.

16:19.960 --> 16:20.960
Oh, that's fair.

16:20.960 --> 16:23.960
I think the Democrats are actually still voting, guys.

16:23.960 --> 16:27.760
Are the Democrats still voting in Georgia, or have they stopped yet?

16:27.760 --> 16:28.760
Do we know?

16:28.760 --> 16:32.240
I think they're still voting, because Biden's not ahead yet.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.440
So there's no one there.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.440
Wow.

16:34.440 --> 16:35.440
He's just talking to nobody.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.440
Brutal.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.440
See-

16:37.440 --> 16:38.440
Now, hold on, hold on.

16:38.440 --> 16:41.440
This is a Shao Kahn joke, sir.

16:41.440 --> 16:47.680
Well, maybe your mood will change once you hear the crowd within the background.

16:47.680 --> 16:48.680
Try this on an actual audience.

16:48.680 --> 16:49.680
Here we go.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.680
I think the Democrats are still voting, guys.

16:50.680 --> 16:51.680
I think the Democrats are still voting in Georgia.

16:51.680 --> 16:52.680
They haven't stopped voting yet, because Joe Biden hasn't been put in the lead.

16:52.680 --> 17:05.680
So they're going to keep voting here in Georgia until Joe Biden gets the lead, but I don't

17:05.680 --> 17:07.680
think it's going to work.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.160
Good stuff.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.920
But I don't think it's going to work.

17:10.920 --> 17:11.920
Good tag.

17:11.920 --> 17:12.920
All right.

17:12.920 --> 17:13.920
Good work, guys.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.880
So, you know, that sound wasn't that great, but I can't throw too much shade at the turnout

17:16.880 --> 17:18.320
at the Atlanta rally.

17:18.320 --> 17:22.720
It's still south of 200 people, but that's really good for an Infowars event that's taking

17:22.720 --> 17:23.720
place during the day.

17:23.720 --> 17:24.720
Yeah, that's not bad.

17:24.720 --> 17:29.440
So far, their daytime rallies have been very, very sad, and this at least looks like what

17:29.440 --> 17:32.200
you might call a group of people.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.160
There were some strange signs in the crowd.

17:34.160 --> 17:38.320
One was just a big queue with the where we go one, we go all slogan.

17:38.320 --> 17:42.460
Another was, quote, Trump's coup d'etat is already underway, which kind of implies that

17:42.460 --> 17:44.080
Trump is leading an overthrow of the government.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.480
I really don't think they get how that sounds.

17:46.480 --> 17:51.080
That seems to either be a counter protester or the opposite of what the messaging is supposed

17:51.080 --> 17:52.080
to be.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.280
I don't know what's going on.

17:53.280 --> 17:58.120
Overall, I would give this Atlanta rally a solid meh.

17:58.120 --> 18:02.460
Decent turnout when we grade on a curve, but full of suspect weirdos and nothing really

18:02.460 --> 18:03.880
interesting at all.

18:03.880 --> 18:07.080
It kind of feels like this was an event that might have been planned already and Owen just

18:07.080 --> 18:10.840
crashed it, since there's definitely some people there who seem to be confused by his

18:10.840 --> 18:11.840
arrival.

18:11.840 --> 18:12.840
Sure.

18:12.840 --> 18:16.800
The video on Infowars is titled, quote, Democrats send operatives to start violence at rally

18:16.800 --> 18:21.520
in Atlanta, which I don't see in the video itself, and even if there were violence in

18:21.520 --> 18:26.360
the video, their claim that they were operatives sent in by anyone is completely manufactured

18:26.360 --> 18:28.240
and not substantiated in any way.

18:28.240 --> 18:32.120
I think the title is in reference to a young woman who drives by and yells that Trump isn't

18:32.120 --> 18:34.960
president anymore, which is the closest I could see.

18:34.960 --> 18:35.960
Just scary stuff.

18:35.960 --> 18:36.960
Yeah.

18:36.960 --> 18:40.560
At a certain point, another guy with a bullhorn threatens Owen's dominance with a we don't

18:40.560 --> 18:43.720
want pedo Joe chant, but it all resolves peacefully.

18:43.720 --> 18:44.720
Oh, that's good.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.720
Yeah.

18:45.720 --> 18:46.720
That's good.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.720
I would hate to see infighting at these.

18:47.720 --> 18:50.840
I imagine they're Democratic operatives.

18:50.840 --> 18:55.520
That's gotta be somebody in the movie who's like, they're green, it's their first operation

18:55.520 --> 18:56.520
in the field.

18:56.520 --> 19:00.440
You know, they've been on the desk for a few years.

19:00.440 --> 19:04.400
Everybody else got injured, so now it's their chance to shine, and they're like, we're sending

19:04.400 --> 19:07.880
you to a rally with 200 people to cause problems.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.600
Uh, oh no.

19:09.600 --> 19:14.020
We're gonna go send you to Agent Provocateur, something that needs no Agent Provocateurs

19:14.020 --> 19:15.520
to get out of control.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.840
Can I try and solve terrorism or something?

19:17.840 --> 19:18.840
Next time.

19:18.840 --> 19:19.840
All right.

19:19.840 --> 19:23.200
So the video from just another channel also doesn't really show any violence.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.920
There's a little bit of yelling between a few people at one point, but it's unclear

19:25.920 --> 19:30.120
what the context is, and then there's a long segment where the video maker and his friend

19:30.120 --> 19:34.880
Tom, who's now our friend Tom, complain about how someone is flipping them off from a nearby

19:34.880 --> 19:36.280
window.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.280
It's pretty sad.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.320
What is wrong with these people?

19:39.320 --> 19:40.320
It's very bummerly.

19:40.320 --> 19:42.240
Oh, I love triggering the lip.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.840
He's giving me the finger!

19:43.840 --> 19:47.880
And they're just like making heart shapes with their hands, and the guy's like fuck.

19:47.880 --> 19:48.880
Fuck you.

19:48.880 --> 19:53.160
So the Atlanta rally was at 3pm, and unlike past stops, this one included what appeared

19:53.160 --> 19:55.200
to be a little bit of an actual march.

19:55.200 --> 19:58.480
I have no idea where they were going or why they were parading, but it seemed like a new

19:58.480 --> 20:00.280
development compared to previous cities.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.360
I don't think they did either, Dan.

20:02.360 --> 20:06.640
From there, Owen was off, because he had to arrive in Columbia, South Carolina for an

20:06.640 --> 20:07.640
8pm rally.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.640
Sure, sure.

20:08.640 --> 20:14.640
Infowars only posted a one minute video about South Carolina, which seems weird, because

20:14.640 --> 20:18.160
from the just another channel footage, it seems like that would be the most useful for

20:18.160 --> 20:19.160
them optically.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.160
Sure.

20:20.160 --> 20:23.780
It was nighttime, the turnout was pretty good, and there were some college students yelling

20:23.780 --> 20:27.520
at them, creating the sort of tension and victimhood they desire in their optics.

20:27.520 --> 20:35.800
Operatives go to college, spend $40,000 to $60,000, and then they're undercover enough

20:35.800 --> 20:38.280
to shout obscenities, yeah.

20:38.280 --> 20:42.940
In the video on Infowars, we get a shot of the caravan itself, and it's really hard to

20:42.940 --> 20:47.800
tell how many of these cars are actually along with them, or if it's just traffic.

20:47.800 --> 20:52.560
Assuming that all these cars are part of the convoy, it's like maybe 10 to 15 cars, which

20:52.560 --> 20:55.960
is nothing to sneeze at if you're an indie band or something, but it's really sad for

20:55.960 --> 20:57.760
day three when you're Infowars.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.360
Yeah, that's not good.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.920
That's not a convoy.

21:00.920 --> 21:05.920
Turnout was alright in Columbia, South Carolina, but again, it's easy to overestimate because

21:05.920 --> 21:07.260
it was nighttime.

21:07.260 --> 21:11.320
They ended up taking a big group picture in front of the Capitol building, and I think

21:11.320 --> 21:13.120
it's about 150 people, probably.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.320
Sure, sure, that's nice.

21:14.320 --> 21:15.320
Yeah.

21:15.320 --> 21:16.320
Good for them.

21:16.320 --> 21:20.960
In the evening of the 11th, things took a turn for the ugly, as the Infowars caravan

21:20.960 --> 21:21.960
came under attack.

21:21.960 --> 21:22.960
Uh oh.

21:22.960 --> 21:27.600
We have a video posted on Parler, trucks were throwing milkshakes at the convoy, and here

21:27.600 --> 21:28.600
is the report.

21:28.600 --> 21:29.600
Well, here we are on the Infowars caravan still.

21:29.600 --> 21:30.600
I think we're like 20 cars strong, 30 cars strong right now.

21:30.600 --> 21:31.600
I'm in line with everybody.

21:31.600 --> 21:32.600
I'm like five cars back behind the Infowars riot wagon, or armored vehicle, whatever you'd

21:32.600 --> 21:33.600
like to call it.

21:33.600 --> 21:52.520
I actually just had a trucker throw something at me, and it exploded all over my truck,

21:52.520 --> 21:55.160
some sort of nasty milkshake or something.

21:55.160 --> 21:56.160
A nasty milkshake.

21:56.160 --> 22:00.720
There was a young girl driving in a Pontiac, and she cut the trucker off, and he started

22:00.720 --> 22:05.600
flashing her, and threw something at her, and it hit me.

22:05.600 --> 22:10.320
So I'm getting attacked because other people in the caravan aren't driving well.

22:10.320 --> 22:17.840
But yeah, I don't know, I've got a million miles, at least, traveling back and forth

22:17.840 --> 22:22.000
across this country, and I've never had a trucker throw a milkshake at me.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
So that's definitely a new one.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.840
Oh, that's nice.

22:26.840 --> 22:32.640
This is rather interesting, but anyway, we're on our way to DC, and I'm going to have to

22:32.640 --> 22:35.640
get a car wash at some point, and wash all that shit off my car.

22:35.640 --> 22:39.320
You can actually see several of our guys up here ahead of us.

22:39.320 --> 22:43.880
You don't get to use car washes.

22:43.880 --> 22:47.840
Driving this caravan stuff is pretty crazy, because people are slowing, and then speeding

22:47.840 --> 22:54.160
up, and slowing, and then speeding up, and then people are trying to cut us off and doing

22:54.160 --> 22:55.160
all kinds of crazy stuff.

22:55.160 --> 22:56.160
No shit!

22:56.160 --> 22:58.160
It's wild driving in caravan, guys.

22:58.160 --> 23:05.840
I hope you're all staying safer than me, not getting any dramas.

23:05.840 --> 23:09.040
People were pretty quick to point out that the reason for all the things this guy is

23:09.040 --> 23:12.160
describing is because they were basically clogging the interstate.

23:12.160 --> 23:13.160
Yeah.

23:13.160 --> 23:17.320
They had 20 cars in a row in the passing lane, which is at best dumb and selfish, and at

23:17.320 --> 23:18.320
worst pretty dangerous.

23:18.320 --> 23:19.320
They did what?

23:19.320 --> 23:20.320
They had it in the passing lane?

23:20.320 --> 23:22.600
They were on the left side of the road.

23:22.600 --> 23:27.160
As a Chicagoan, that upsets me more than what they stand for.

23:27.160 --> 23:32.100
When you do a convoy like this, there's no reason that the cars all need to actually

23:32.100 --> 23:36.440
travel down the highway in a line, but that's what they seemed insistent on doing, which

23:36.440 --> 23:37.440
is stupid.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.440
Of course.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.700
Plus, they were doing this convoy at night for no reason.

23:40.700 --> 23:44.680
This was the leg between Columbia, South Carolina, and Raleigh, North Carolina, which is about

23:44.680 --> 23:50.800
three and a half hours drive, and the North Carolina rally was at 3 p.m. on Thursday.

23:50.800 --> 23:54.520
There's no reason to night drive that one in a convoy 20 cars deep.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.240
That's just asshole behavior.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.720
Oh, God.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.200
Luckily, everyone survived.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.880
You don't get to use a car wash.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.340
You're a rugged individualist.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.560
You have to find a fucking hose.

24:04.560 --> 24:08.600
You don't get to use all of these creature comforts if you're trying to sell yourself

24:08.600 --> 24:11.320
as the fucking revolutionary that you are.

24:11.320 --> 24:12.320
I would like to...

24:12.320 --> 24:16.800
Sheik Ravara didn't fucking wash his shit in a fucking washing machine.

24:16.800 --> 24:20.600
I'd like to shift your criticism.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.440
I don't care whether they use car washes or not.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.440
Fine, I get that.

24:23.440 --> 24:27.880
I would like to say you don't get to complain about someone throwing a milkshake at your

24:27.880 --> 24:28.880
car.

24:28.880 --> 24:29.880
That I agree with.

24:29.880 --> 24:30.880
Grow up.

24:30.880 --> 24:31.880
That I thoroughly agree with.

24:31.880 --> 24:32.880
Yeah.

24:32.880 --> 24:38.160
So yeah, everyone survived, and now we jump in on the 12th on Alex Jones' show.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.160
Because again, who knows?

24:39.160 --> 24:43.120
David Knight might have had full coverage of the caravan, and it'll be a mystery lost

24:43.120 --> 24:44.120
to time.

24:44.120 --> 24:45.920
Much like, who built the pyramids?

24:45.920 --> 24:47.400
Was it the aliens or was it Egyptians?

24:47.400 --> 24:48.400
It was not the aliens.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.400
We'll never know.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.800
What if David Knight covered it back then?

24:51.800 --> 24:54.600
Non-white people can also build things, turns out.

24:54.600 --> 24:59.720
But what if the equivalent of David Knight covered ancient mysteries, and we'll just

24:59.720 --> 25:01.440
never know because it was so boring.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.440
Yeah, that's possible.

25:02.440 --> 25:03.440
That's possible.

25:03.440 --> 25:07.960
If you wanted to hide true information, you give it to David Knight and no one will ever

25:07.960 --> 25:08.960
know.

25:08.960 --> 25:12.480
If you want to have really fun, interesting, fake information, give it to him and it'll

25:12.480 --> 25:15.960
bore the shit out of me, which is normally what happens.

25:15.960 --> 25:20.640
So anyway, here is Alex attempting to make some analogies, and I apologize in advance

25:20.640 --> 25:22.560
for the audio quality on this show.

25:22.560 --> 25:27.600
They were saying, Alex, why are they having people that have moved out of California vote

25:27.600 --> 25:31.320
for Biden when Biden was already going to win the state?

25:31.320 --> 25:34.120
Well once you're already flipping everybody's votes and already stealing, you keep stealing

25:34.120 --> 25:35.120
to stay in power.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.120
Why?

25:36.120 --> 25:37.120
That's why nobody can win as a Republican in California.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.120
They already got it.

25:38.120 --> 25:42.840
They already got it in California unless you had like an 80% victory because of the fraud.

25:42.840 --> 25:45.040
That's why there was 87% turnout.

25:45.040 --> 25:50.040
We never had anything near that in the US, usually 55, 60% because people went out to

25:50.040 --> 25:55.520
vote against Donald Trump, Biden, and they just got cheated by the computer.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.840
So that's coming up.

25:56.840 --> 25:59.040
But again, people are like, well, why would they cheat in California if they've already

25:59.040 --> 26:00.040
got it?

26:00.040 --> 26:01.840
Because they already cheated.

26:01.840 --> 26:04.240
It's like saying- You're a genius.

26:04.240 --> 26:09.320
If you've remarried and your new wife's pregnant and you're like, well, why do you have an

26:09.320 --> 26:10.320
18 year old son?

26:10.320 --> 26:13.360
Well, I got another woman pregnant before.

26:13.360 --> 26:15.480
There's no third dimensional thought here.

26:15.480 --> 26:17.040
Why are they stealing stakes they already got?

26:17.040 --> 26:19.040
Because they already got them.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.040
What?

26:20.040 --> 26:21.880
I mean, let me use another example.

26:21.880 --> 26:22.880
Yes, please.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.440
Let's say I'm slaughtering cows.

26:24.440 --> 26:25.440
Okay.

26:25.440 --> 26:26.440
All right.

26:26.440 --> 26:29.760
And I'm about to slaughter a new one to put it in my deep freeze.

26:29.760 --> 26:30.760
Of course.

26:30.760 --> 26:34.080
And people ask, well, why do you keep the other deep freeze going that's got some of

26:34.080 --> 26:35.080
the last cow left in it?

26:35.080 --> 26:37.080
It just doesn't even register.

26:37.080 --> 26:41.960
See, once we start thinking third dimensionally, we can defeat the globalists because they're

26:41.960 --> 26:43.480
operating third dimensional.

26:43.480 --> 26:44.880
We can operate fourth, fifth dimension.

26:44.880 --> 26:45.880
Are they?

26:45.880 --> 26:46.880
Many plays out.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.880
And that's what we do here at Infowars.

26:48.880 --> 26:52.720
I don't know if Trump plays 3D chess or 5D chess, but I know I do.

26:52.720 --> 26:56.520
So I listened to Alex a bunch so I can help you out here because that was a garbled mess.

26:56.520 --> 26:57.520
Sure.

26:57.520 --> 26:58.520
Yeah, that was great.

26:58.520 --> 26:59.840
I got the point really well.

26:59.840 --> 27:00.840
Did you?

27:00.840 --> 27:01.840
Yeah.

27:01.840 --> 27:02.840
Well, let's see if you did.

27:02.840 --> 27:03.840
Okay.

27:03.840 --> 27:06.920
Well, what I think is that Trump basically won almost every state, but there was fraud

27:06.920 --> 27:07.920
all over the place.

27:07.920 --> 27:08.920
Sure.

27:08.920 --> 27:13.960
There was even massive voter fraud in California, which people he talks to can't understand.

27:13.960 --> 27:17.440
They don't understand why the globalists would steal votes in California when California

27:17.440 --> 27:19.860
consistently votes Democrat.

27:19.860 --> 27:23.680
Alex's explanation is that California doesn't actually consistently vote Democrat, and the

27:23.680 --> 27:28.560
appearance that they do is only there because of the voting fraud that's already and always

27:28.560 --> 27:30.240
going on there.

27:30.240 --> 27:33.820
They were stealing votes in California because they're only in power in California due to

27:33.820 --> 27:36.680
all the votes they always steal.

27:36.680 --> 27:40.040
This is not that complicated of a concept that he's trying to describe, and yet Alex

27:40.040 --> 27:44.320
struggles to come up with two really bad analogies.

27:44.320 --> 27:47.920
The first is getting married and your new wife is pregnant, but you have an 18-year-old

27:47.920 --> 27:50.240
child, which is from a previous marriage.

27:50.240 --> 27:54.520
This analogy doesn't make sense because each pregnancy would be an unrelated event, whereas

27:54.520 --> 27:58.340
the imaginary voting fraud would probably only be able to be pulled off by the people

27:58.340 --> 28:02.000
in California because the people committing all the fraud are in power and covering it

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
up.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.840
They're having kids because they've already always been having kids, Dan.

28:06.840 --> 28:07.840
We'll get to that.

28:07.840 --> 28:12.680
The previous fraud facilitates the current fraud in the California example.

28:12.680 --> 28:16.320
The way to make this analogy actually work would be to imagine a scenario where the new

28:16.320 --> 28:20.640
wife allows Alex to impregnate her because she's so impressed that he has an 18-year-old

28:20.640 --> 28:21.640
son.

28:21.640 --> 28:22.640
That would make sense.

28:22.640 --> 28:26.120
Something about his son needs to implicate the current situation, and in the existing

28:26.120 --> 28:28.420
analogy, that's not the case.

28:28.420 --> 28:31.800
With the California stuff, the idea is that they're stealing the election because they

28:31.800 --> 28:32.800
always do.

28:32.800 --> 28:36.840
So it's possible that another way to make this analogy work is for Alex's response to

28:36.840 --> 28:41.680
this person to be that his new wife is pregnant because he only gets romantically involved

28:41.680 --> 28:43.160
with women, he's gotten pregnant.

28:43.160 --> 28:44.160
Yeah, that would make sense.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.240
Then the analogy would work.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.240
That would make sense.

28:46.240 --> 28:50.600
The second analogy Alex is trying is that he's slaughtering a cow while keeping what's

28:50.600 --> 28:53.280
left of his previous cow in the deep freeze.

28:53.280 --> 28:56.680
This also doesn't make sense based on what he's trying to say.

28:56.680 --> 29:01.360
This would be a good analogy if he were trying to argue that Democrats kept deep frozen votes

29:01.360 --> 29:06.360
from the last election to use in this one because they won by such a wide margin last

29:06.360 --> 29:08.720
time so they had leftovers or something.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.160
Are they reusable like that?

29:10.160 --> 29:15.280
I mean, in terms of keeping cows in the deep freezer, that's how that might work.

29:15.280 --> 29:19.160
I would put the votes in a plastic bag so they don't get wet.

29:19.160 --> 29:20.160
Smart.

29:20.160 --> 29:24.400
Neither of these analogies help clarify his point, but Alex insists this is somehow third

29:24.400 --> 29:27.440
dimensional thinking, whatever the fuck that means.

29:27.440 --> 29:32.080
Really the only thing that these two analogies have in common is a sense of time that whoever

29:32.080 --> 29:35.040
Alex is talking to seems unaware of.

29:35.040 --> 29:38.400
The child from a previous marriage analogy involves a person who doesn't realize you

29:38.400 --> 29:41.520
could have had a child with someone else in the past.

29:41.520 --> 29:45.220
The cow butchering example involves a person who doesn't realize that the cow in the freezer

29:45.220 --> 29:48.080
will eventually be eaten in the future.

29:48.080 --> 29:51.880
The only thing I come away from this convinced of is that Alex is really bad at analogies,

29:51.880 --> 29:55.760
and the people he talks to on a regular basis must have a difficulty with really elementary

29:55.760 --> 29:58.680
concepts, maybe even object permanence.

29:58.680 --> 30:01.600
Have we tested Alex on object permanence?

30:01.600 --> 30:03.240
We tried to play peek-a-boo?

30:03.240 --> 30:08.560
I would be interested to know exactly what extent his object permanence lasts to.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.440
I assume it's more than peek-a-boo.

30:10.440 --> 30:11.440
Okay.

30:11.440 --> 30:12.440
But is it like six months?

30:12.440 --> 30:17.760
If anybody who's involved with the Sandy Hook trial is listening, on the stand, test his

30:17.760 --> 30:20.120
object permanence.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.380
Here's what you do.

30:21.380 --> 30:26.760
On the first day, hold up a sign, and then see if he remembers that there was a sign

30:26.760 --> 30:27.760
in the room.

30:27.760 --> 30:28.760
Anyway.

30:28.760 --> 30:29.760
That would be fun.

30:29.760 --> 30:30.760
Yeah.

30:30.760 --> 30:33.920
So, in this next clip, Alex discusses the cycle of history.

30:33.920 --> 30:38.400
He has some interesting theories about this, but it's pretty simple, based on his assessment.

30:38.400 --> 30:39.400
Okay.

30:39.400 --> 30:40.800
What happens throughout history?

30:40.800 --> 30:41.800
Good question.

30:41.800 --> 30:42.800
Stuff.

30:42.800 --> 30:48.440
Governments get power, whether it be in ancient China or ancient Middle East, or ancient Mesoamerica

30:48.440 --> 30:53.640
or ancient Europe, and routinely, they have periods where there'll be whole kingdoms,

30:53.640 --> 30:58.640
whole civilizations of thriving people, and just suddenly, there's no one left.

30:58.640 --> 31:04.480
And this archeologist go there, there's archeological digs in Germany, archeological digs in Mexico,

31:04.480 --> 31:06.120
everywhere.

31:06.120 --> 31:10.880
Archeological digs in Africa, and they'll build a civilization, and then within a hundred

31:10.880 --> 31:15.240
years, everybody's dead, and they find them all sacrificed.

31:15.240 --> 31:19.120
The final phase, eaten by the priest class.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.120
Sure, sure.

31:20.120 --> 31:21.120
Yes.

31:21.120 --> 31:24.800
There is a demonic force, ladies and gentlemen, that's trying to depopulate us, and they're

31:24.800 --> 31:25.800
announcing it publicly.

31:25.800 --> 31:26.800
I'm going to break it down on the other side.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.840
This is the most important broadcast in the world.

31:28.840 --> 31:31.200
This is the cycle of history.

31:31.200 --> 31:32.200
Wow.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.200
Wow.

31:33.200 --> 31:38.500
I wish there was some way that every archeological dig throughout history found some sort of

31:38.500 --> 31:46.240
recording or a tablet or something, and it's all just the same Alex Jones ideas.

31:46.240 --> 31:51.920
Like every civilization has been ultimately destroyed by somebody like Alex Jones.

31:51.920 --> 31:58.520
Someone who thinks that all history is a cycle of decadence leading to the priest eating

31:58.520 --> 31:59.520
everyone.

31:59.520 --> 32:05.040
There's had to be somebody in ancient Rome just running around screaming like, the priest

32:05.040 --> 32:06.040
class is eating people.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.040
They're eating people.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.040
Almost certainly.

32:08.040 --> 32:09.040
Ah, ah, ah.

32:09.040 --> 32:10.040
Yes.

32:10.040 --> 32:15.360
I would say that maybe in crueler times they had less of an influence.

32:15.360 --> 32:16.360
Sure, possible.

32:16.360 --> 32:17.360
Because they couldn't ever-

32:17.360 --> 32:18.360
There's so much cruelty.

32:18.360 --> 32:21.560
Well, because they could never get to a point where they would have a radio show.

32:21.560 --> 32:22.560
Sure, that's fair.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.560
You know, people would just like-

32:23.560 --> 32:24.560
Kill them.

32:24.560 --> 32:25.560
Yeah.

32:25.560 --> 32:26.880
And I'm not saying that's the ideal solution.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.600
No, I don't think so.

32:28.600 --> 32:34.360
I do guarantee that this sort of mentality has probably existed throughout all cultures.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.480
Yeah, I would probably argue that most governments-

32:36.480 --> 32:37.480
I mean, it's just paranoia, right?

32:37.480 --> 32:38.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:38.480 --> 32:43.120
I mean, on a basic level it's all just like sort of imaginative, creative paranoia.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.120
Yeah.

32:44.120 --> 32:49.920
Yeah, I mean, I suppose you could probably make a very good argument that every civilization

32:49.920 --> 32:56.120
ultimately collapses when the perceived corruption of the government equals the actual corruption

32:56.120 --> 32:57.120
of the government.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.120
Hmm.

32:58.120 --> 32:59.120
Do you know what I'm saying?

32:59.120 --> 33:00.120
I hear what you're saying.

33:00.120 --> 33:01.960
I don't know how I could test that in the moment.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.600
I don't know how I could test your theory.

33:03.600 --> 33:04.600
Okay.

33:04.600 --> 33:05.600
I'm not sure-

33:05.600 --> 33:06.600
Let me give you an analogy.

33:06.600 --> 33:07.600
I slaughtered a cow.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.600
I slaughtered a cow.

33:08.600 --> 33:09.600
Yep.

33:09.600 --> 33:10.600
Alright, move on.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.600
Deep freeze?

33:11.600 --> 33:12.600
Next one.

33:12.600 --> 33:13.600
No, I understand what you're saying.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.600
I think it's an interesting thought, but I don't know if I fully agree with you.

33:16.600 --> 33:17.600
Yeah, no.

33:17.600 --> 33:18.600
I don't know if it's accurate, but it's an interesting thought.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.080
I don't know if I fully agree with me.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.200
Well, it's well said.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.200
It sounds really great, doesn't it?

33:22.200 --> 33:23.200
It sounds almost like an aphorism.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.200
Yeah, it really does.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.200
Yeah.

33:25.200 --> 33:29.760
Society collapses when the perceived corruption matches the actual corruption.

33:29.760 --> 33:30.760
You could see that on a pillow.

33:30.760 --> 33:31.760
It sounds like something somebody smart would say.

33:31.760 --> 33:32.760
Yeah.

33:32.760 --> 33:36.880
Never mind, I take back my comment because now it's pillow worthy.

33:36.880 --> 33:37.880
Yeah, yeah.

33:37.880 --> 33:38.880
So it's probably not true.

33:38.880 --> 33:39.880
No.

33:39.880 --> 33:40.880
No, definitely not true.

33:40.880 --> 33:41.880
No.

33:41.880 --> 33:42.880
It's probably economics.

33:42.880 --> 33:43.880
Yeah.

33:43.880 --> 33:46.480
I worry about it being bullshit because it sounds good.

33:46.480 --> 33:47.480
It sounds so good.

33:47.480 --> 33:48.480
Yeah.

33:48.480 --> 33:49.480
Yep.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.360
Speaking of things that are bullshit-

33:51.360 --> 33:52.360
Shao Kahn jokes?

33:52.360 --> 33:59.880
Caravan, at some points, more than 400 cars, some join, some leave, is on its way right

33:59.880 --> 34:02.080
now and is in North Carolina.

34:02.080 --> 34:06.360
There's absolutely zero chance that there have been 400 cars in the caravan at any point,

34:06.360 --> 34:10.240
and I would be comfortable betting that there wasn't even a total of 400 cars throughout

34:10.240 --> 34:11.400
the entire thing.

34:11.400 --> 34:15.080
I would go so far as to bet that the combined turnout for the events that have happened

34:15.080 --> 34:19.600
up to this point on November 12th are barely more than 400 total people.

34:19.600 --> 34:20.600
I would agree.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.560
This is insane levels of hubris.

34:22.560 --> 34:26.560
Yeah, there aren't enough people in the cars themselves.

34:26.560 --> 34:30.240
It's not like there's four people to a car where if you guys could all afford your own

34:30.240 --> 34:32.880
individual cars, there would be 200 cars.

34:32.880 --> 34:33.880
Yeah.

34:33.880 --> 34:34.880
No.

34:34.880 --> 34:35.880
There's five guys.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.200
I'm offended that there probably are 10 cars.

34:38.200 --> 34:40.080
That to me is shocking and scary.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.080
What are you guys doing?

34:41.080 --> 34:42.080
What are you guys doing?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.580
Three of the cars are probably Infowars employees.

34:44.580 --> 34:46.960
Another one is the guy from Just Another Channel.

34:46.960 --> 34:50.160
Another car is the Hippies for Trump.

34:50.160 --> 34:51.160
They're not busy.

34:51.160 --> 34:52.160
No.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.160
This is their dream.

34:53.160 --> 34:54.160
This is their dream.

34:54.160 --> 34:58.360
We want to live the hippie lifestyle while also supporting a political mandate that is

34:58.360 --> 34:59.720
trying to actively kill us.

34:59.720 --> 35:02.080
My grandpa followed the Grateful Dead around.

35:02.080 --> 35:04.200
I'm following Owen Schroyer.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.200
Oh, man.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.920
Oh, that's real bad.

35:08.920 --> 35:11.840
You know where the best place to get drugs is?

35:11.840 --> 35:14.480
The parking lot of an Owen Schroyer show.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.120
Who's my real dad, mom?

35:17.120 --> 35:24.560
Well, back in the 2020s, Owen Schroyer came through South Carolina and we spent one magical

35:24.560 --> 35:27.320
night together on the Infowars caravan.

35:27.320 --> 35:34.280
And here you are.

35:34.280 --> 35:39.720
Like 70-year-old people with Infowars caravan tattoos.

35:39.720 --> 35:40.720
Where were you, man?

35:40.720 --> 35:41.720
Oh, man.

35:41.720 --> 35:42.800
You should have seen it.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.440
There were upwards of 50 people.

35:45.440 --> 35:52.560
If you can remember the Infowars caravan, that means you weren't there.

35:52.560 --> 35:57.400
You sad bastards.

35:57.400 --> 35:58.400
Oh, God.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.400
It's a bummer.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.400
It's just a bummer.

36:00.400 --> 36:01.400
It's such a bummer.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.400
It's such a bummer.

36:02.400 --> 36:03.400
Anyway.

36:03.400 --> 36:04.400
Oh, man.

36:04.400 --> 36:05.400
Let's get back to house.

36:05.400 --> 36:06.400
What did you do?

36:06.400 --> 36:10.400
I followed Pat Robertson around for a summer.

36:10.400 --> 36:11.400
What?

36:11.400 --> 36:16.600
I do love the idea.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.600
All right.

36:18.600 --> 36:22.520
We can't live in 18 different versions of that exact same joke.

36:22.520 --> 36:28.440
We jump back to Alex and I will say that there is one thing that Alex is pretty consistent

36:28.440 --> 36:29.440
on.

36:29.440 --> 36:30.440
It's something he's very wrong about.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.320
And that is that he does not exaggerate things.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.240
He talks about that a little bit here.

36:34.240 --> 36:38.320
I've thought about doing this broadcast for 26 plus years.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.840
You always think about what could be your last broadcast.

36:40.840 --> 36:44.840
I'm not saying this is my last broadcast, but I need to just let you know, I need to

36:44.840 --> 36:49.640
explain something to you that I don't exaggerate any of this, okay?

36:49.640 --> 36:52.360
Most of the time it's worse than I'm telling you.

36:52.360 --> 36:56.800
And this could be our last broadcast next week could be, but the zone we're in right

36:56.800 --> 37:01.440
now, the internet kill switch they've got, they can hit telecommunications as well.

37:01.440 --> 37:05.840
And we're in the prime zone for them to assassinate Trump, set a nuke off, anything.

37:05.840 --> 37:08.080
Well, good thing you don't exaggerate.

37:08.080 --> 37:09.760
Never ever feel safe.

37:09.760 --> 37:14.960
I don't exaggerate things, but if you spend one single moment in safety, you're an idiot.

37:14.960 --> 37:21.920
Does this mean that this is the actual last broadcast that he's been teasing doing to

37:21.920 --> 37:23.600
play after he's done?

37:23.600 --> 37:24.600
If he's never exaggerated anything.

37:24.600 --> 37:25.600
Because that would imply that he's already quitting.

37:25.600 --> 37:26.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:26.600 --> 37:27.600
It's very weird.

37:27.600 --> 37:30.960
I don't know what's going on because he's talking about this sort of like it could be

37:30.960 --> 37:31.960
his last broadcast.

37:31.960 --> 37:32.960
It's not.

37:32.960 --> 37:33.960
He's on tomorrow.

37:33.960 --> 37:34.960
No, obviously.

37:34.960 --> 37:39.000
It's on the next day, but like I want him to do that fucking mythical last broadcast

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
already.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Yeah, it has to.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Yeah.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.440
How can you say I don't exaggerate things and then say this could be our last broadcast

37:45.440 --> 37:51.280
knowing full well that you've got at least several more months in the, you know, like

37:51.280 --> 37:52.840
you're very an asshole.

37:52.840 --> 37:56.520
Your very exhortation for money is in and of itself an exaggeration.

37:56.520 --> 37:57.520
Yeah.

37:57.520 --> 37:58.520
Cause you're an ass.

37:58.520 --> 37:59.520
Yeah.

37:59.520 --> 38:03.200
Um, this, this sort of thing though, this extremeness is, is really escalating here

38:03.200 --> 38:04.960
in this, this stretch of time.

38:04.960 --> 38:08.680
I guess maybe Alex is disappointed in the care event cause he's talking about like,

38:08.680 --> 38:12.920
you know, a nuke's going to go off, Trump could get assassinated or turn off the internet.

38:12.920 --> 38:13.920
Why not?

38:13.920 --> 38:16.960
Uh, he basically in this next loop just says, head to the Hills guys.

38:16.960 --> 38:17.960
It's over.

38:17.960 --> 38:22.000
I have been under such stress knowing that we have a chance to stop this and save billions

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
of people.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.880
And the stress has been on me that I, Howard Stern made jokes about it and it's a funny

38:26.880 --> 38:29.680
viral video, but I had three molars collapsed the last two months.

38:29.680 --> 38:32.920
I mean, all my teeth are literally crushing and falling out of my face.

38:32.920 --> 38:37.360
Uh, I have to wear those fucking pills on it and I'm not feeling sorry for myself.

38:37.360 --> 38:42.400
My spirit is absolutely lashing out at this and in fighting and God really last night

38:42.400 --> 38:46.480
said to the Holy spirit to me to comfort me and to say, listen, this is the way it's going

38:46.480 --> 38:51.280
to be and it's your job is just get people ready and you've done your job.

38:51.280 --> 38:52.960
Now you just need to get them ready.

38:52.960 --> 38:56.100
So I'm just going to tell you it's all over folks.

38:56.100 --> 39:00.160
The best thing you can do is get to the countryside somewhere and try to dig in because it's all

39:00.160 --> 39:01.560
just going to get worse.

39:01.560 --> 39:02.640
Holy shit.

39:02.640 --> 39:07.320
The only thing that differentiates Alex from someone like Jim Jones is that Jim Jones was

39:07.320 --> 39:08.320
specific.

39:08.320 --> 39:09.320
Yeah.

39:09.320 --> 39:10.320
Yeah.

39:10.320 --> 39:11.320
Also not for nothing.

39:11.320 --> 39:15.400
Like you even responded to this being passionate doesn't result in grinding your teeth to the

39:15.400 --> 39:17.160
point they fall out of your head.

39:17.160 --> 39:21.600
However, that's one of the most common symptoms of stimulant abuse between that pretty much

39:21.600 --> 39:25.640
everything about how Alex acts and the fact that Joe Rogan tried to get Alex to talk about

39:25.640 --> 39:30.360
his problem with Adderall on their last episode kind of makes the picture come into focus.

39:30.360 --> 39:33.200
Alex might as well be like a high functioning coke head.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.200
Yeah.

39:34.200 --> 39:41.240
This is, this is the, it all makes a bit more sense when you imagine that, Oh yeah, he's

39:41.240 --> 39:42.240
on stimulants.

39:42.240 --> 39:43.240
Yep.

39:43.240 --> 39:48.680
That's a disappointingly simple answer, but probably the correct one.

39:48.680 --> 39:49.680
Yeah.

39:49.680 --> 39:52.320
Well, I don't think it makes a, uh, I don't think it explains everything.

39:52.320 --> 39:58.480
Obviously there's still a whole bunch of ideas that are bad and it certainly doesn't let

39:58.480 --> 40:02.960
him off the hook for his behavior, but it does make it like a lot of things that don't

40:02.960 --> 40:07.080
make sense do make sense when you consider like, Oh, he's just on drugs.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.080
Yeah.

40:08.080 --> 40:09.080
Yeah.

40:09.080 --> 40:10.080
Yeah.

40:10.080 --> 40:11.080
That's about right.

40:11.080 --> 40:13.320
Billions are going to die and you got to head to the Hills.

40:13.320 --> 40:14.320
Sure.

40:14.320 --> 40:17.800
Alex needs you to know billions are going to die.

40:17.800 --> 40:18.800
He doesn't exaggerate though.

40:18.800 --> 40:19.800
Billions are going to die.

40:19.800 --> 40:20.800
Oh shit.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.880
They're going to release mass bio weapons and kill billions of people and I don't just

40:23.880 --> 40:28.680
say that you will watch billions die with blood pouring out of their eyes, their ears,

40:28.680 --> 40:29.680
their mouths.

40:29.680 --> 40:30.680
Okay, cool.

40:30.680 --> 40:34.440
I mean, you're, you're going to watch absolute mass extermination.

40:34.440 --> 40:35.440
We didn't stand up for the children.

40:35.440 --> 40:40.460
We didn't stand up for God and we rejected Christ and Satan now is coming into the earth

40:40.460 --> 40:42.760
and I'm not trying to be negative.

40:42.760 --> 40:45.280
Everybody wants to hear all this positive lies.

40:45.280 --> 40:47.040
All you can do is get right with Christ.

40:47.040 --> 40:49.600
I can just tell you right now, we can hold them back.

40:49.600 --> 40:53.840
Trump may still prevail, but we've seen the model of the devil's attack.

40:53.840 --> 40:56.460
It's exactly what revelation says, but now we're in it.

40:56.460 --> 41:02.600
We are now entering Satan's first big lash with his plan and he'll keep going and going

41:02.600 --> 41:06.280
and going until he makes war on the saints and overcomes them.

41:06.280 --> 41:10.640
It's going to be really difficult to go back to normal after that.

41:10.640 --> 41:15.200
Um, no, we're living in the biblical end times.

41:15.200 --> 41:19.760
There isn't like a really easy way to walk back.

41:19.760 --> 41:24.160
We're in revelation because revelation doesn't include like false starts.

41:24.160 --> 41:27.680
Guys, I got some good news for you.

41:27.680 --> 41:29.000
They closed the third seal.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.620
They closed the third seal back up, guys.

41:31.620 --> 41:34.040
We've only got to deal with seals one and two.

41:34.040 --> 41:35.040
Let's get to work.

41:35.040 --> 41:39.240
Especially, there's going to need to be a lockdown to deal with all these goddamn plagues.

41:39.240 --> 41:47.400
We have a special seal sealant and uh, yeah, get the fuck out of here.

41:47.400 --> 41:48.400
Yeah.

41:48.400 --> 41:49.400
It's troubling.

41:49.400 --> 41:55.240
It's troubling because like it feels like the only move after this is go away or become

41:55.240 --> 41:58.280
a doomsday like full on religious preacher.

41:58.280 --> 41:59.280
Yeah.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.280
I don't.

42:00.280 --> 42:03.040
They did all that stuff when Obama was elected to those, the biblical end times.

42:03.040 --> 42:05.160
I kept hearing about that.

42:05.160 --> 42:06.160
No, that's true.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.160
That's true.

42:07.160 --> 42:08.160
But I heard about the biblical end times an awful lot.

42:08.160 --> 42:10.480
Sure, but probably from biblical end times preachers.

42:10.480 --> 42:11.480
Well, yeah.

42:11.480 --> 42:13.080
They can be wrong a bunch of times.

42:13.080 --> 42:14.080
That's true.

42:14.080 --> 42:17.420
But they can't transition to something less extreme.

42:17.420 --> 42:20.880
You know, like they can say we were wrong or whatever.

42:20.880 --> 42:21.880
Sure.

42:21.880 --> 42:23.840
I mean, they could become a hot dog then.

42:23.840 --> 42:24.840
These are the blood moons.

42:24.840 --> 42:27.800
This is the real, you know, like you can do that.

42:27.800 --> 42:28.800
That would be fun.

42:28.800 --> 42:31.680
Like look, last time we thought we knew it was up, but this time blood moon.

42:31.680 --> 42:32.680
Yeah.

42:32.680 --> 42:36.280
But you can't be like, ah, the world is going to end.

42:36.280 --> 42:37.800
I know it's coming.

42:37.800 --> 42:41.620
And then be wrong and then be like, well, what you really need to do is focus on your

42:41.620 --> 42:44.200
alderman race or, or whatever.

42:44.200 --> 42:50.960
Or like, it's really tough to desensationalize from the point of end times.

42:50.960 --> 42:57.600
Well, I mean, that's again, like the idea of, of like, all right, we lost this one.

42:57.600 --> 43:02.640
Devil's going to win, but we got to focus on the midterms in order to defeat the devil

43:02.640 --> 43:03.640
again I guess.

43:03.640 --> 43:04.640
Right.

43:04.640 --> 43:09.520
And the other problem too is if you are an end times type, end times always got to be

43:09.520 --> 43:10.520
coming.

43:10.520 --> 43:11.520
Yeah.

43:11.520 --> 43:12.520
End times cannot be here.

43:12.520 --> 43:13.520
No, it's really bad when it's here.

43:13.520 --> 43:14.520
Yes.

43:14.520 --> 43:15.520
Yeah, that'll fuck you up.

43:15.520 --> 43:18.920
The money is in end times being coming down the road somewhere.

43:18.920 --> 43:19.920
Totally.

43:19.920 --> 43:20.920
It really screws things up when it's here.

43:20.920 --> 43:25.960
And I think Alex is going to, I don't know, I see this as a bad decision on his part.

43:25.960 --> 43:30.960
So Alex gets to talking about galactic laws, contract law for aliens.

43:30.960 --> 43:31.960
Sure.

43:31.960 --> 43:32.960
This is really stupid.

43:32.960 --> 43:34.080
This is fifth dimensional chess, huh?

43:34.080 --> 43:35.080
This is fucking stupid.

43:35.080 --> 43:38.440
I don't know all the timelines, but are the globalist always tell us what they're going

43:38.440 --> 43:41.920
to do in their internal documents that are public, but they don't promote them, but it's

43:41.920 --> 43:42.920
a metaphysical rule.

43:42.920 --> 43:43.920
They got to tell you what they're doing.

43:43.920 --> 43:46.440
Kind of leave the plans laying on the road side.

43:46.440 --> 43:49.880
So you have a chance to read the fine print if you can find it, kind of a public notice.

43:49.880 --> 43:53.880
That's why you have public notice that they're going to take a piece of property or public

43:53.880 --> 43:56.680
notice they're about to tear something down or public notice they're about to take a park

43:56.680 --> 43:57.680
away from you.

43:57.680 --> 44:03.480
Because they have to give you notice because you have metaphysical, spiritual rights, unalienable

44:03.480 --> 44:05.600
rights to challenge that.

44:05.600 --> 44:09.080
This is common law, this is galactic law, this is God's law, and even the devil has

44:09.080 --> 44:10.080
to follow it.

44:10.080 --> 44:14.300
This is a comically childish and stupid view of morality, and I would just like to take

44:14.300 --> 44:17.840
everyone who claims that Alex is smart and he has good points and ask them what they

44:17.840 --> 44:22.680
think of that, because that moral system that Alex is presenting is really hard to defend

44:22.680 --> 44:24.760
if you want to look at human history.

44:24.760 --> 44:28.220
It's simple enough to say that everyone who deprived people of their unalienable rights

44:28.220 --> 44:30.040
went to hell after they died.

44:30.040 --> 44:31.040
Like Thomas Jefferson.

44:31.040 --> 44:33.400
Uh, yeah, that's kind of a problem.

44:33.400 --> 44:39.520
Alex would have to then either say that slavery doesn't violate unalienable rights or a bunch

44:39.520 --> 44:42.220
of his heroes and ancestors are in hell.

44:42.220 --> 44:46.100
But leaving that aside, looking at the actions that are ascribed to the devil in traditional

44:46.100 --> 44:50.600
Christian lore, I don't see where he's warning people what he's going to do before he does

44:50.600 --> 44:51.600
it.

44:51.600 --> 44:55.240
In the Garden of Eden, it's God who tells them not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge.

44:55.240 --> 44:58.720
If God hadn't done that, then the serpent would presumably have done the exact same

44:58.720 --> 45:02.320
thing it did in the story and convinced Adam and Eve to eat the fruit.

45:02.320 --> 45:06.040
The serpent didn't do anything except a manipulative, evil act.

45:06.040 --> 45:09.520
The part where there was a warning came from someone else entirely.

45:09.520 --> 45:14.340
So in order for this to make any sense in Alex's moral conception, the morality or immorality

45:14.340 --> 45:19.000
of your actions can be determined by other people's actions.

45:19.000 --> 45:24.440
This would imply that it would be very wrong for me to punch you randomly and without warning.

45:24.440 --> 45:28.800
However, if someone were to tell you Dan is going to punch you when you go to his house,

45:28.800 --> 45:32.240
then my punch would be completely fine, because someone else let you know that it was coming

45:32.240 --> 45:34.320
and you chose to come here anyway.

45:34.320 --> 45:40.040
In fact, in this conception, it could be argued that me punching you is never immoral in and

45:40.040 --> 45:41.400
of itself.

45:41.400 --> 45:46.020
If my punch is morally correct when someone else warns you and morally incorrect when

45:46.020 --> 45:50.000
they do not, the actual distinction is the warning itself.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.080
That's where the moral weight lies, so it becomes a matter of the other person doing

45:54.080 --> 45:56.560
something immoral by not warning you.

45:56.560 --> 45:58.520
My punch doesn't matter at all.

45:58.520 --> 46:02.280
So then, what if no one else knows that I'm going to punch you?

46:02.280 --> 46:06.080
Then apparently I have to tell you ahead of time that I plan to punch you, and then if

46:06.080 --> 46:09.960
you come over anyway, you've consented to being punched.

46:09.960 --> 46:12.080
This is stupid for a number of reasons.

46:12.080 --> 46:16.040
To what extent do I need to make sure that you're aware that I'm going to punch you?

46:16.040 --> 46:18.080
You have to serve people before you punch them.

46:18.080 --> 46:22.280
Is it enough that I mumble it to you as you leave, knowing that you'll probably not hear

46:22.280 --> 46:25.440
me or forget by the time we end up getting together to record again?

46:25.440 --> 46:27.900
I think you have to put it in a movie.

46:27.900 --> 46:31.340
Is it enough for me to write, I'm going to punch Jordan the next time he comes over on

46:31.340 --> 46:35.260
a piece of paper that I taped to a lamppost two miles north of my house, knowing that

46:35.260 --> 46:37.640
you'll never pass that lamppost?

46:37.640 --> 46:39.360
That's how Arthur Dent got that bypass.

46:39.360 --> 46:43.920
Could that satisfy the metaphysical condition, even though there's literally no way it could

46:43.920 --> 46:45.680
ever impact your behavior?

46:45.680 --> 46:46.700
Ask the Vogons.

46:46.700 --> 46:51.380
You could say that the warning was there if you wanted to look for it, and it's really

46:51.380 --> 46:55.080
your fault that you didn't find that lamppost, it was right there in the open for everyone

46:55.080 --> 46:56.100
to see.

46:56.100 --> 47:00.720
To what extent does the person the thing is being done to need to be aware of the thing

47:00.720 --> 47:03.240
that's going to be done to them?

47:03.240 --> 47:07.300
This is a question that Alex cannot answer, because no matter what the answer is, shit

47:07.300 --> 47:09.000
doesn't make sense.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.400
If the standard is informed consent, then the globalists need to be doing way more warning

47:13.400 --> 47:17.320
than they're doing right now, and honestly would probably need to get literally everyone

47:17.320 --> 47:22.400
to sign off on their plans, knowing the implications of what they're agreeing to, so it obviously

47:22.400 --> 47:23.880
can't be that.

47:23.880 --> 47:28.780
If the standard is that the person needs to believe the warning, is that possible, that

47:28.780 --> 47:30.200
you need to believe it?

47:30.200 --> 47:33.440
Because even if that's the standard, I still don't think you deserve to be punched for

47:33.440 --> 47:36.160
coming over, whether or not you believe the warning.

47:36.160 --> 47:39.120
You might not believe it, someone could say Dan's going to punch you if you come over

47:39.120 --> 47:40.880
and you'd be like, ah fuck you.

47:40.880 --> 47:45.600
But you understand that this line of thinking makes perfect sense because of the way that

47:45.600 --> 47:48.200
all of these people have to deal with hell?

47:48.200 --> 47:53.040
Like okay, if everybody that doesn't accept Jesus Christ into their heart is going to

47:53.040 --> 47:58.480
hell, Jesus didn't get his message out for a good long while to the rest of the world,

47:58.480 --> 48:03.560
so all of those people, despite never having heard of Jesus Christ spend eternity in hell

48:03.560 --> 48:09.360
just because God was like, nah geographical product placement.

48:09.360 --> 48:14.160
So your argument then has to be, well there's evidence of God all around you, so you should

48:14.160 --> 48:18.120
have known that God was real, and obviously Christ, if there's a God there's got to be

48:18.120 --> 48:19.120
a Christ.

48:19.120 --> 48:23.280
So it's still your fault, and that's why hell is justifiable to people who've never heard

48:23.280 --> 48:24.280
of Christianity.

48:24.280 --> 48:30.740
That might be, I think that you're trying to bring too much sense to it, and I'm trying

48:30.740 --> 48:33.040
to deconstruct this from an ethical perspective.

48:33.040 --> 48:35.960
I'm saying that you've deconstructed both fairly well.

48:35.960 --> 48:39.320
Well see, here's what I think that Alex would say the standard is.

48:39.320 --> 48:43.480
He would say that the standard that you need to achieve is that you need to publicly admit

48:43.480 --> 48:48.480
this somewhere, so even if you do it in code that's only decipherable to a genius like

48:48.480 --> 48:51.440
Alex Jones, that's still good enough.

48:51.440 --> 48:55.400
I struggle to see how this qualifies as warning people in an ethically meaningful way, for

48:55.400 --> 48:59.160
the same reason that my message taped to a lamppost doesn't seem like it could reasonably

48:59.160 --> 49:02.640
be seen as possibly impacting your behavior.

49:02.640 --> 49:05.520
I mean, you know, Dan, we're dealing with Satan and God.

49:05.520 --> 49:08.120
There's obviously a lot of wiggle room in the rules.

49:08.120 --> 49:09.120
Those two guys aren't known for absolutes.

49:09.120 --> 49:10.880
Alex is talking about human behavior too.

49:10.880 --> 49:12.120
Oh shit, well we're fucked.

49:12.120 --> 49:16.920
In order to make this morality work, it must not be the would-be victims of the crime that

49:16.920 --> 49:21.080
are required to be warned about what this person's going to do.

49:21.080 --> 49:24.760
It must be a thing where the act of writing it down and putting it out there is to serve

49:24.760 --> 49:29.360
as a notice to God of their intentions, but what kind of sense does that make?

49:29.360 --> 49:33.280
Also what are the consequences for breaking these supposed galactic laws, and why should

49:33.280 --> 49:35.440
the devil be concerned with any punishment?

49:35.440 --> 49:37.480
He's already the fucking devil.

49:37.480 --> 49:38.480
Disintegration.

49:38.480 --> 49:40.440
It's the punishment he fears most.

49:40.440 --> 49:41.440
Well then what?

49:41.440 --> 49:45.000
Okay, so he does that and then he disintegrates, great, there's no devil anymore, hooray!

49:45.000 --> 49:49.160
Well, but God would have to create another devil, otherwise his prophecy wouldn't come

49:49.160 --> 49:50.160
true.

49:50.160 --> 49:54.520
See, again, here's where I'm really struggling with Alex and all this bullshit.

49:54.520 --> 50:00.240
You understand that for your actual religion to not be bullshit, you have to have the end

50:00.240 --> 50:01.240
times.

50:01.240 --> 50:02.560
You can't stop them.

50:02.560 --> 50:04.560
You can't delay them.

50:04.560 --> 50:05.840
It's God's moment.

50:05.840 --> 50:07.160
He chooses.

50:07.160 --> 50:12.760
There's no way that Biden is going to affect God's plan, otherwise your entire religion

50:12.760 --> 50:13.760
is nonsense.

50:13.760 --> 50:16.160
Yeah, and you can't vote on the devil.

50:16.160 --> 50:18.920
You can't vote on the devil!

50:18.920 --> 50:22.560
I'm assuming Job would have had a different vote.

50:22.560 --> 50:26.720
This is the moral system of a child, and honestly it's embarrassing to hear him try to explain

50:26.720 --> 50:27.720
his beliefs.

50:27.720 --> 50:31.320
It also kind of makes me sad to hear how small his vision of the divine is.

50:31.320 --> 50:35.720
It's the same kind of bummer I get whenever I hear people on Project Camelot talking about

50:35.720 --> 50:38.760
like alien contracts and stuff, it's like ugh.

50:38.760 --> 50:39.840
Come on.

50:39.840 --> 50:45.100
Are you saying to me that even if we get beyond the stars, we're never going to get past the

50:45.100 --> 50:51.120
point where a signature is going to hold the entire universe together?

50:51.120 --> 50:53.000
It's still just going to be a signature.

50:53.000 --> 50:57.200
Yeah, and God is trying to get the devil on technicalities or something.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.200
Exactly!

50:58.200 --> 50:59.200
Alright.

50:59.200 --> 51:00.200
Aha!

51:00.200 --> 51:01.200
We have him on a Rico case!

51:01.200 --> 51:02.200
Yeah.

51:02.200 --> 51:06.560
So, at this point, Alex does something incredibly familiar.

51:06.560 --> 51:12.200
Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, broadcasting worldwide again, we are back live broadcasting

51:12.200 --> 51:13.200
worldwide.

51:13.200 --> 51:20.120
I am your host, Alex Jones, very, very thankful to be here with you today.

51:20.120 --> 51:24.760
And I believe I'm connected, I believe I'm live, but, okay, we're going to rebroadcast

51:24.760 --> 51:29.040
for a while, and I will be back because I've got to reset and go into this.

51:29.040 --> 51:37.080
No, I'm cool now, I've got to reset, I can't do it, so there's too much going down here.

51:37.080 --> 51:41.280
So, as I was saying, I've got some really important news we're going to be covering

51:41.280 --> 51:43.920
here until you get reset.

51:43.920 --> 51:49.040
And I sent you guys a lot of videos, I sent you guys a lot of things.

51:49.040 --> 51:54.000
And so, the first thing that I'm going to want to play is whatever you guys want to.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
I'll be back in a little while.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
What?

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
What just happened there?

51:58.000 --> 52:00.360
This is an important announcement.

52:00.360 --> 52:04.360
So I was thinking about this and wondering, what the fuck is going on?

52:04.360 --> 52:05.360
Yeah.

52:05.360 --> 52:09.720
Alex is in DC now, he's already arrived in DC, so you lost the bet.

52:09.720 --> 52:14.200
So he's freaking out trying to do this show remotely, and it sounds like shit.

52:14.200 --> 52:18.140
Like there's a lot of audio crackliness, it's just terrible.

52:18.140 --> 52:21.500
And honestly, even beyond that, his heart is not in it.

52:21.500 --> 52:25.000
So he freaks out a little bit and he goes to rebroadcast, it honestly wasn't surprising

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
to me at all.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.240
It honestly seemed like a prudent decision.

52:29.240 --> 52:32.520
The only real question to me is, why is he hosting at all?

52:32.520 --> 52:33.520
Good question.

52:33.520 --> 52:36.840
Then it dawned on me, there's probably no one else who can host.

52:36.840 --> 52:40.000
Schroyer's on the caravan.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
David Knight is definitely not a primetime candidate.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.360
Well, I think David Knight, he has his own show, and he had a heart attack like a year

52:47.360 --> 52:48.360
ago.

52:48.360 --> 52:49.360
Oh, that's true.

52:49.360 --> 52:53.680
And his workload, for his own sake, I think it's great that he's not taking on unnecessary

52:53.680 --> 52:57.800
burdens, but I think that he would probably not be the person who would, and he's not

52:57.800 --> 52:59.080
gonna move product.

52:59.080 --> 53:03.240
And Millie Weaver is gone forever, Deanna Lorraine is terrible.

53:03.240 --> 53:06.160
She's too green, probably for the main show.

53:06.160 --> 53:09.760
Same problem with Harrison Smith, like he can fill in on the War Room because no one's

53:09.760 --> 53:16.120
watching that, but actual Owen show, or I'm sorry, actual Alex show, seems like it's probably

53:16.120 --> 53:17.120
no good.

53:17.120 --> 53:19.200
Millie Weaver is gone, like he can't talk to Mike Adams anymore.

53:19.200 --> 53:20.200
No, of course not.

53:20.200 --> 53:26.320
All the fourth hour fill-in hosts are either, like, they wouldn't do it, or, how are you

53:26.320 --> 53:29.160
gonna have three and a half, four hours of Gerald Cilenti?

53:29.160 --> 53:31.000
It's too much.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.760
Are those the funeral bells?

53:32.760 --> 53:35.760
Because I can hear Roger Stone's name coming right down the pipe.

53:35.760 --> 53:36.760
He's day drunk.

53:36.760 --> 53:37.760
That's true.

53:37.760 --> 53:38.760
He's fucked up.

53:38.760 --> 53:39.760
See, now that's what I want.

53:39.760 --> 53:41.480
I want three hours of rambly day drunk Roger Stone.

53:41.480 --> 53:42.480
I do not.

53:42.480 --> 53:43.480
I listen to it.

53:43.480 --> 53:44.480
I do not want it.

53:44.480 --> 53:45.480
Fair.

53:45.480 --> 53:48.920
There will literally be no one left at Info Wars who's able to fill in for Alex.

53:48.920 --> 53:50.240
It's interesting, in a way.

53:50.240 --> 53:54.200
He's kind of reached the pinnacle of success, but at the same time, he's right where he

53:54.200 --> 53:55.200
started.

53:55.200 --> 53:59.160
He's got a giant business with a ton of employees, but he still needs to do everything himself

53:59.160 --> 54:00.720
because everyone sucks.

54:00.720 --> 54:04.560
He's the president's biggest cheerleader, but he's still ignored and cast aside in favor

54:04.560 --> 54:11.080
of more seemingly acceptable right-wing commentators, same as it ever was.

54:11.080 --> 54:15.600
I feel like you should realize that the path he's on leads nowhere, and it never has.

54:15.600 --> 54:19.640
It started with him being alone, and it's going to end with him being alone, and good

54:19.640 --> 54:21.120
luck to you, buddy.

54:21.120 --> 54:23.480
Except there's some good news.

54:23.480 --> 54:24.480
What's that?

54:24.480 --> 54:29.560
He goes off air, and he comes back, and then he starts talking about having cancer, and

54:29.560 --> 54:30.560
I was like-

54:30.560 --> 54:31.560
Wait, what now?

54:31.560 --> 54:32.560
I was like, wait, do you actually have cancer?

54:32.560 --> 54:33.560
It's like, nah, I don't have cancer.

54:33.560 --> 54:34.560
Oh, okay.

54:34.560 --> 54:37.120
Just the only way I can talk to you is from the heart and where I'm at before I hit all

54:37.120 --> 54:38.400
this news.

54:38.400 --> 54:40.920
I am devastated.

54:40.920 --> 54:42.920
I am devastated.

54:42.920 --> 54:49.040
It's not just that I've learned that I have cancer, and that I'm dying.

54:49.040 --> 54:51.400
It's I've learned we all have cancer, and we're all dying.

54:51.400 --> 54:55.400
I don't literally have cancer, though you have cancer every day, and your body kills

54:55.400 --> 54:56.400
it with your immune system.

54:56.400 --> 54:57.400
Oh my God.

54:57.400 --> 54:58.400
Okay.

54:58.400 --> 54:59.400
All right, buddy.

54:59.400 --> 55:00.400
Okay.

55:00.400 --> 55:01.400
All right.

55:01.400 --> 55:02.400
You didn't even need to add that shit.

55:02.400 --> 55:03.400
No.

55:03.400 --> 55:04.400
Just say I don't have cancer.

55:04.400 --> 55:06.520
But I could always be fighting off cancer any moment of any day.

55:06.520 --> 55:12.360
That weirded me out, because I kind of felt like, oh, that makes sense, you have cancer.

55:12.360 --> 55:15.960
I don't know.

55:15.960 --> 55:19.160
I would believe it if he was like, I have terminal cancer.

55:19.160 --> 55:20.880
Oh, well, yeah, okay.

55:20.880 --> 55:21.880
Shit.

55:21.880 --> 55:23.240
Well, no wonder you want the world to end.

55:23.240 --> 55:24.240
Yeah.

55:24.240 --> 55:26.240
Your narcissism is experiencing it that way.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.240
You don't want to go alone.

55:27.240 --> 55:28.240
Yeah, yeah.

55:28.240 --> 55:29.240
Well, no.

55:29.240 --> 55:30.240
Unfortunately, that is not the explanation.

55:30.240 --> 55:33.860
Not unfortunately, I don't even know how I would put it, but that's not the explanation.

55:33.860 --> 55:35.560
He just thinks that everyone's going to die.

55:35.560 --> 55:37.920
But you should know, he's not happy to report that.

55:37.920 --> 55:38.920
Sure.

55:38.920 --> 55:42.400
I'm sitting here last night and this morning, thinking about what I'm going to say today

55:42.400 --> 55:45.960
on the air because of all the announcements and all the statements that have been made,

55:45.960 --> 55:51.960
confirming our worst analysis and then some, and I don't feel good coming on air, telling

55:51.960 --> 56:00.380
you that we're all dead.

56:00.380 --> 56:04.640
But I want to explain to you the reality of this, and we'll do it next segment because

56:04.640 --> 56:06.200
I'm very emotional right now.

56:06.200 --> 56:07.200
Sound like it.

56:07.200 --> 56:08.200
Yeah.

56:08.200 --> 56:09.200
Yep.

56:09.200 --> 56:10.200
Very emotional right now.

56:10.200 --> 56:11.200
Oh boy.

56:11.200 --> 56:12.200
All right.

56:12.200 --> 56:13.200
I don't want to, man.

56:13.200 --> 56:16.200
And now I just, now that we kind of get more of the gist of what he told his kids at the

56:16.200 --> 56:21.760
breakfast table, you're going to watch billions die is like not a good morning.

56:21.760 --> 56:23.960
Kids, you got to head to the hills.

56:23.960 --> 56:24.960
No kidding.

56:24.960 --> 56:28.760
Hey, we can do remote learning as far remote as we need to be.

56:28.760 --> 56:31.260
Hey, look, I got some John Birch society books.

56:31.260 --> 56:34.280
That's all the book learning you need.

56:34.280 --> 56:38.240
So yeah, I mean, we're all going to die and Alex takes no pleasure in reporting that.

56:38.240 --> 56:39.240
That's nice of him.

56:39.240 --> 56:44.240
I think he kind of wouldn't be reporting that if Trump had won the election, which is weird.

56:44.240 --> 56:46.280
But it turns out the election stolen.

56:46.280 --> 56:50.320
They stole this bigger than Dallas in front of everybody.

56:50.320 --> 56:55.880
But Hey, if you catch somebody in your house with the safe or in your house with the computers

56:55.880 --> 57:00.420
or in your house with a silverware and then the family heirlooms, do you have a right

57:00.420 --> 57:02.120
to take it back?

57:02.120 --> 57:03.940
Damn right you do.

57:03.940 --> 57:05.800
And so they are panicking.

57:05.800 --> 57:08.280
They're saying have a coup against Trump all over the news.

57:08.280 --> 57:09.540
They're saying he's insane.

57:09.540 --> 57:13.320
He's crazy because he's not going to let them have this fifth attempted coup against us

57:13.320 --> 57:14.320
separately.

57:14.320 --> 57:18.880
You've got my commitment to burn the candle at both ends here, ladies and gentlemen, and

57:18.880 --> 57:19.880
we're fighting hard here.

57:19.880 --> 57:23.880
We need your financial support info or store.com bringing a caravan up here and flying here

57:23.880 --> 57:24.880
with the crew and all.

57:24.880 --> 57:25.880
We love you.

57:25.880 --> 57:26.880
We appreciate you.

57:26.880 --> 57:30.520
Info or store.com bringing this caravan up here is a shockingly pointless and spent a

57:30.520 --> 57:32.000
lot on gas for no reason.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
Yeah.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
No grammar.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
I do.

57:35.000 --> 57:40.520
I do appreciate the, the if you know, if you catch a robber in your house, you know, that's,

57:40.520 --> 57:41.520
that's good.

57:41.520 --> 57:47.760
If you catch, you know, you have a right to defend yourself, et cetera.

57:47.760 --> 57:53.360
But if instead of doing that, you're a, you lose something and then you drive to DC and

57:53.360 --> 57:57.760
murder someone who has, you've never met before and who's never been to where you live.

57:57.760 --> 57:59.160
It's not quite the same as a robber.

57:59.160 --> 58:00.400
It's not the same thing.

58:00.400 --> 58:02.920
No, I would, I would argue it feels similar to Alex.

58:02.920 --> 58:03.920
It does though.

58:03.920 --> 58:04.920
Yeah.

58:04.920 --> 58:05.920
Yeah.

58:05.920 --> 58:06.920
Cause of metaphysical laws.

58:06.920 --> 58:07.920
Sure.

58:07.920 --> 58:11.120
Um, so the Alex is, you know, I think you can tell also from that clip that the audio

58:11.120 --> 58:12.240
has not gotten better.

58:12.240 --> 58:13.240
No.

58:13.240 --> 58:14.240
And so Alex gets really mad again.

58:14.240 --> 58:15.240
Of course.

58:15.240 --> 58:16.240
I'm on the road.

58:16.240 --> 58:17.240
I'm here in Washington, DC.

58:17.240 --> 58:21.120
I'm having a lot of technical difficulties, but I'm just gonna stay on here as best as

58:21.120 --> 58:22.120
I can.

58:22.120 --> 58:23.120
They're on the break.

58:23.120 --> 58:26.080
We'll try to fix the big muddy signal.

58:26.080 --> 58:28.200
I'm getting blessed in my ear, but that's okay.

58:28.200 --> 58:32.080
That's why I like to go just with a laptop, just straight Skype.

58:32.080 --> 58:33.080
It's like clean.

58:33.080 --> 58:35.560
You got this big fan dangled thing.

58:35.560 --> 58:38.080
It looks like a space shuttle over here and it's just, it just hammers the hell out of

58:38.080 --> 58:39.080
me every time.

58:39.080 --> 58:40.520
I got to make an executive decision.

58:40.520 --> 58:41.520
I'm going to rebroadcast.

58:41.520 --> 58:42.520
I'm going to plug in all this.

58:42.520 --> 58:48.960
I'm going to laptop because, uh, yeah, it'll take a while, but it's okay.

58:48.960 --> 58:52.120
You know, we're real, we're real transmission there.

58:52.120 --> 58:53.760
I'm just trying the best I can here.

58:53.760 --> 58:54.760
I'm not complaining either.

58:54.760 --> 59:00.320
It's just, uh, God, the whole country's going to hell in a ham basket, man.

59:00.320 --> 59:01.320
I feel it.

59:01.320 --> 59:05.280
We're still having broadcasting issues, so of course the entire country is falling apart

59:05.280 --> 59:06.280
naturally.

59:06.280 --> 59:11.320
Isn't, isn't my shitty set up just indicative of the state of the world?

59:11.320 --> 59:19.200
Isn't it strange that me, Alex Jones of Info Wars would have issues with my phone connection.

59:19.200 --> 59:24.640
Hey, I constantly have these tech issues that plague me in studio and out and every time

59:24.640 --> 59:28.800
I try and take a phone call from somebody and now here I am trying to broadcast from

59:28.800 --> 59:32.640
DC and I'm having problems, it's somehow I'm surprised by it.

59:32.640 --> 59:35.280
It's a shock and the world is clearly going to hell.

59:35.280 --> 59:36.280
Totally.

59:36.280 --> 59:40.640
I will say that it's not, it's interesting that there's, this happens twice on this show.

59:40.640 --> 59:41.640
Of course.

59:41.640 --> 59:45.440
Uh, I think I don't, I don't recall the last time he's done this twice, um, but he ends

59:45.440 --> 59:49.680
up vamping until the commercial breaks, so he doesn't actually have to storm out a second

59:49.680 --> 59:50.680
time.

59:50.680 --> 59:53.620
Um, but he ends up leaving early.

59:53.620 --> 59:56.400
Of course he ends up, uh, he's got more fun things to do.

59:56.400 --> 59:57.400
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

59:57.400 --> 59:58.400
Yeah, totally.

59:58.400 --> 01:00:02.080
He's wearing a hat, got cattle.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:07.960
So that's what it comes down to, how I'm out riding the range, which I wish I was doing

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:08.960
checking the fences.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:13.480
I might be wearing a Stetson, but I don't, I'm not lucky enough to get to do that because

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:20.280
my country is in so much damn peril, but I can't like Hank Williams Jr.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:24.720
I like to ride my horse and shoot my gun.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:31.000
Every boy's work she's never done, now the rest of the song goes.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.920
That Lord has certainly made a lot of beautiful women out there, honey.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:36.920
Wow.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:43.560
Harrison Smith is going to be taken over, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm tempted to pop

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:51.760
back in, but, uh, I won't, I was here mentioning all this news.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.640
All this information, this unfolding hell, there's been so many people in this hotel

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.040
room walking back and forth.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.480
I can't even remember what the last clip was.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.480
I was going to play.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.680
Well, what was the next clip guys?

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:08.320
I was going to get there.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.320
That's right.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.320
That's where I wanted to go.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.080
So this is a great ad for brain force.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:18.520
Um, you know, these sort of new tropics, these supplements that give you focus and clarity

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.640
and the ability to really stay on task.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.880
Yeah, and the ability to disintegrating.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.280
That one's also a real eye opener.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:30.000
The ability, like when you talk about mental fog versus clarity, you're talking about the

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.960
ability to do a radio show in a hotel room where there are other people present.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:35.960
Yeah.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:40.680
God, just, anyway, Harrison Smith takes over for like the last half hour and I think that's

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.680
about right.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.120
I think that's, that's about what he can handle.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.440
He's boring as shit.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.080
He's terrible, but give him a little time.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.080
Yeah.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.080
Get his feet wet.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.080
Yeah.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.080
Give him five minutes up top.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.080
He'll start the show.

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.080
Yeah.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.080
Yeah.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.080
It's that kind of thing.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.080
Yeah, for sure.

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.080
It's that, it's that, uh, that standup show.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.120
It's like, all right, I want you to get some experience, but we still have to move some

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.280
product so we have to keep the audience happy.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.280
So Alex is going to do most of it, although he's not going to do much.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.280
No.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:15.480
So, uh, that night or that day in a caravan activities, it was really stormy that day

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.560
for Owen.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:21.040
So he talked to an underwhelming group of people in the rain in, uh, in North Carolina

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.680
about how the election was stolen.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.680
Sure.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.460
And honestly, by this point, the charm of the caravan caravan had worn off for me.

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:28.600
It's redundant.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:33.120
It's unimpressive and ultimately it's too obvious what the game is.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.040
This is all about creating the optics of taking your dumb show on the road, arriving at a

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:41.320
much larger event and then giving yourself credit for the turnout at the large event.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:42.320
Yeah, totally.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.120
It's honestly pretty disappointing.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.200
There was such great potential for this road trip.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.240
In the end, it's really forgettable.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.240
Yeah.

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.640
I tried to find an angle of something interesting.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.840
We talked about the open mic comic who did the Shao Kahn impression.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.740
I tried to see if there was a human interest angle in here somewhere, but there just isn't.

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:03.340
They had the opportunity to do something really interesting and compelling, and instead they

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:05.960
did exactly what Infowars always does.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:09.480
They produced a cookie cutter performance that was meant to create profit and gather

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:13.480
attention while funneling support to larger fascist movements.

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:17.440
I'm really disappointed in them, but I also know there's not really anything else they

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.080
can do.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:24.120
The only thing that's even close to interesting in this stretch is they did a damage control

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:29.080
video in Raleigh where Greg Reese and some other employee discuss how someone gave them

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.600
a book with a Nazi bookmark in it.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.480
Their angle, naturally, is that this was an agent provocateur leftist who was there to

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:40.040
make Trump look bad, although I would argue it's equally possible it was just a fan who

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.140
gave them a Nazi bookmark in a yoga book.

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:47.840
After the Raleigh stop, they added on to Richmond, Virginia, and honestly, it's a fine turnout,

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.500
but it's more of the same.

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:54.000
My highlight is that a guy is playing the trumpet there while the crowd sings the national

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.620
anthem, and a shot of the trumpet player happens to include a historical marker in the background.

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:06.600
This was actually shot on the site of the 1863 Richmond Bread Riot, which is kinda fitting.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.880
The Union forces had hurt supply lines for the Confederacy, so prices of food had increased

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.780
in Richmond considerably.

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:17.760
From History.com, quote, on April 1st, a group of poor working women held a meeting in a

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.040
Baptist church to organize a demonstration against the rising costs of food.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:26.360
Mary Jackson, a 34-year-old mother, and Martha Ferguson riled up the audience with tales

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.160
of rampant speculation and price gouging happening in the markets.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:34.600
Soon, the mob was angry enough to agree to meet the very next day outside the Capitol

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.600
building and extract bread and justice from the men in charge.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:42.880
The governor initially refused to meet with them, but then when he did, he was unsympathetic,

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.680
so the mob went on a tear and started rioting.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:49.480
They stole food, but also luxury goods, until the riot police arrived and were prepared

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.880
to fire.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:54.680
The reason that I think this is fitting that this ridiculous display was on this same site

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:59.320
as the Bread Riot is because the aftermath of that riot was that the Confederacy tried

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:03.920
really hard to keep it quiet, since they knew that word of this internal chaos would raise

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.360
the morale of the Union armies.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.360
These videos are really things that Owen in Infowars should try to keep quiet.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.480
They're out there yelling about how this is the end of the country, and this caravan's

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.760
the last battle, and these are the crowds they can draw?

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:20.400
I don't know if that raises my morale, but I think it should hurt theirs if they looked

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.400
at it honestly.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.760
Like, this is not impressive stuff.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.740
Yeah, I wouldn't like it.

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:35.600
If I was doing that in any capacity, like, even, like, I went on tours where I made negative

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.600
money.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:40.440
I think I've only exclusively done that.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.320
I think I broke even one stamp.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.320
Maybe.

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.440
Maybe for me.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.240
But yeah, if I was doing this in any...

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:53.240
Like, this would be bad for me on an amateur tour.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.800
Like that's the level of bad this is.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:57.880
Yeah.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:03.920
You might be able to get a little bit of b-roll from this for a larger thing.

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:04.920
Yeah, that's true.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.640
Like the camp video?

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.640
The wrap-up video?

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:08.640
Yeah, maybe.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.640
But yeah, it's not...

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.280
No, this isn't good.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:20.120
It seems to me like this is them throwing everything they've got, the most extreme language,

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:25.700
the most immediacy possible, and it's still incredibly underwhelming.

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:29.280
And I would be embarrassed of that if I were Infowars, and if I were Owen.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:34.880
I would treat this like the Confederacy treated the Bread Riot, and I would not have the Trumpeteer

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.400
standing right in front of the memorial of that.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.400
Hide it.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.400
Yeah.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.400
Oh boy.

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:46.480
So we jump to the 13th, Friday, and Alex is back hosting his show again from DC.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.480
From DC.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:50.480
That would have been really funny if he'd gone home.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.480
Yeah.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.600
Fuck it.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.600
We can't...

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.440
I can't do it from here, and nobody is home!

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:57.840
Trump called yesterday, but I was napping.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.840
Yeah.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.840
And I can't call him back.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:04.840
He drove by the hotel, and he stopped by, and I was napping, and he just couldn't get

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:05.840
in!

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:08.640
They wouldn't let him in because he didn't have a room!

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.640
Yep.

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.640
Classic hotel staff.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.640
Classic hotel.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:16.400
Yeah, it would be funny if you left, but instead he stayed and then just did nothing.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.400
Yeah.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.400
Except for yelling to a bullhorn.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.400
That sounds right.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:24.640
But here he is talking about what has happened on the caravan, and you would know that this

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.740
wasn't true if you were keeping up with the caravan.

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:28.740
How would I know?

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:36.880
Well, we caught Antifa on the way here following us from Florida up into Virginia, now in DC,

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:41.480
posing as patriots in handing out white supremacist literature.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:45.080
So that's going to be their main mission tomorrow.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:50.440
We actually caught them on video red-handed, and we actually intercepted their communications.

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:51.440
We love you, Alex!

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.800
Through a source.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.280
Here's our Nazi stuff!

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.280
Through a mole.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.280
I'll sell them.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280
We've infiltrated them.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:05.040
We're planning to dress like MAGA folks at the march tomorrow, be wearing their red baseball

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:11.000
caps backwards, and wearing camouflage pants is how they're dressing.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.320
So Alex is just making all that up.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:19.480
And the only thing that's real is that book that someone gave them with a Nazi bookmark

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:22.720
in it that they've decided is leftist agitators.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:28.440
And now he's turned this into they have a mole, and Antifa followed them from Florida

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:34.100
up through the whole convoy all the way up, and there's plans for in DC, they're going

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:39.800
to show up with backwards MAGA hats and camouflage pants, and they're going to hand out dirty

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:44.000
literature to everyone to make the patriots look bad.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.160
So dumb.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:55.080
I can think of few things that would do more for the cause than Antifa joining that Infowars

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:58.480
caravan as agent provocateurs.

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:02.320
I just don't think there's anything else that could be done for the movement that would

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.960
have that much effect.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:18.080
I don't think I've heard anybody but me talk about this.

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:21.080
The caravan is just for them and us, isn't it?

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:26.440
I'm not positive that I've seen any angry tweets about it or anything.

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:31.120
I think I saw a couple people posting about the milkshake from the truckers.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.760
I think I saw a little bit of jokes about that.

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:39.200
But in terms of this, I don't think anybody gives a shit except for them and me.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.960
I don't think Antifa's following anybody.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:48.420
It's really annoying that you spend all of your time whipping up white supremacists to

01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:52.480
fight for you, and then you're like, I don't know where all these white supremacists come

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.480
from.

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.480
Must be leftists.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.480
Must be Antifa.

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.480
Come on, man.

01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:58.620
You've spent so much time loving these guys.

01:09:58.620 --> 01:09:59.620
Let's just move on.

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:00.700
It's a little much.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:03.120
Just say it.

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:06.400
It's not going to alienate 48% of the country.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.680
It's not going to alienate the people who are still listening to you at this point.

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.680
Exactly.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:15.480
If you can ramble about the literal devil all the fucking time and say all this nonsense

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:19.040
bullshit and people don't leave, just mask off, man.

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:23.240
Just toss a sig heil out there who fucking cares.

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:27.940
But even if he does do that, these listeners, Nazi or otherwise, need to recognize that

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:29.560
their lives are over.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:33.240
And so because their lives are over, it's time to go yell at the governor.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:37.880
OK, when you're tuning in, I want everybody to understand your life is over, as you know

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:40.480
it, until you fight back.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:44.660
We need people every day surrounding the governor's mansion where Governor Abbott is.

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.220
If he's in a restaurant eating, you don't go up and threaten him.

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:50.440
You go up and you say, sir, we know you're being blackmailed.

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:51.440
We know the lockdown's permanent.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.440
Be a leader and stop it.

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:55.160
We need to start his recall.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:59.720
Smash cut to Alex complaining about people yelling at Trump officials at restaurants.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.120
A bunch of leftist provocateurs, yeah.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:06.200
Also, there are 20 states in the United States where a governor can be recalled, and Texas

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.920
is not one of them.

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:12.760
In order for Alex to do his plan about recalling Governor Abbott, he would first need to find

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:18.080
justification for a new law in the Texas Constitution and then get a law passed by the state legislature.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.920
It would be a cumbersome process that he's not up for, and honestly, it would probably

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:26.960
just be easier to wait until he's up for re-election and then field a fringe-ass candidate to lose

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.120
to him and probably split the vote so a Democrat ends up winning.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.340
Also, Governor Abbott's not being blackmailed.

01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:37.300
He's still an incredibly far-right politician, just not far-right enough for Alex.

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.400
He's failed Alex's purity tests.

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:45.040
It's not illegal to write a law that just says Governor Abbott can never be governor,

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.040
right?

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.040
Abbott out.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.040
Yeah, no Abbott.

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.040
No Abbott's forever.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.320
Yeah, that might be an interesting law.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.320
I would be interested in that law.

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.120
I think it would get challenged.

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.120
Someone would file a lawsuit.

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:58.040
On what grounds?

01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.920
I'm not a lawyer.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:05.280
So in this next clip, this clip's a little bit long, but I kept it in because it begins

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:10.800
with Alex talking about how he's not into offensive violence.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:14.480
And then it's quite a ramble about a bunch of nonsense.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.440
But I think I needed to play, it's two and a half minutes long, but the reason I wanted

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:25.240
to play this whole chunk is like, if you listen to this, it's sort of an ABA kind of structure,

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:32.200
where you have the A theme of offensive violence, then B is kind of just random talking points,

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:37.600
spaghetti up against the wall, and then you return to what the thesis of the initial thought

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:38.600
was.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:43.200
But by that point, your brain will, if you're not paying attention, you'll kind of already

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.040
have forgotten that that's what he was talking about.

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:54.320
And this happens quite a bit, but I rarely play full clips of it, just because it's long.

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:57.480
And I don't want any offensive violence, but I see a lot of talk online, people saying

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.760
time to dust off the muskets.

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:05.260
Here's the issue, existentially, and I'll give you these clips of the big news.

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:13.720
Under common law, under common sense, you cannot come with experimental dangerous vaccines,

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:17.960
whether they be safe or not, and they're not, they're deadly, and it's obviously the takeover.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:21.040
These people have liability protection, they have long histories of killing people with

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.040
vaccines.

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.360
They are eugenicists that want to depopulate you.

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:27.240
When somebody says, I want to depopulate you, and he's spent hundreds of billions of dollars

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:31.040
he got from big foundations and the robber barons to get control of the world health

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.600
system and most nation state systems, he's been thrown out of over 20 countries, Gates,

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.980
has been, he's in another 140 or so.

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.360
Thrown out of 20 countries.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:43.520
When you've got something of that matter through a plate glass window, and he says he wants

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:48.000
to do this, and it's what he comes out of, Cold Springs Harbor and the eugenics, and

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.720
then he's coming, violating the Geneva convention, violating the Nuremberg code, violating international

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:55.720
law.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:14:00.000
If the Nazis were coming to give you a deadly shot or take your kids away, you don't just

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.560
have a right, you have a duty to fight them.

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:05.140
So they've already shut down the communications almost everywhere.

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.140
Now they're coming.

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:10.960
Now they're going to beta test in Canada and Europe in this round and in California and

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:14.840
in New York, dragging people out of their homes, beating people up that don't wear masks,

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:15.840
taking people's children away.

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.040
The UN said that was the goal.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.760
It's already happened in Australia and Spain.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.600
Now it's happening in England.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.040
And they're just normalizing that vans come, cops have guns.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.040
You disappear.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:30.280
And then again, if they say you have COVID, these are leftist doctors at extermination

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.980
centers, not guillotines.

01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:33.800
They say, oh, he had COVID.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.960
And now you're going to see people take it to the COVID centers.

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.000
It's already happening in Australia.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
People die in these.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.120
You're totally healthy.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.120
They take you.

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.300
They go, oh, he got sick.

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:43.680
We had to innovate him.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.480
And yeah, he died after two weeks on a ventilator.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:51.880
So they strap you down and the comics Chinese do this and they put it down your lungs and

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.120
they kill you.

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.000
And they sit there and laugh at you while you're dying.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.600
And they turn it up way higher.

01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:00.720
Like a lot of the old folks in the blue city areas where they have these killer eugenics

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:04.920
doctors, they're, they're, they're in cult bioethics boards, like, like Ezekiel Emanuel

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.460
saying he wants to kill old people.

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.640
He runs this.

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:12.360
He hires for decades, all, all these boards, these are psycho killers.

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:16.960
And even the medical association said, why did you give people twice the pressure you're

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:17.960
supposed to?

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.520
And there's like, because they got to get kill numbers.

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:25.280
So they're coming to kill you.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.800
They're coming to kill you.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.960
They're coming to kill you.

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.600
So you kind of, you kind of get what I'm saying.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.160
He starts with the presentation of like, there's a lot of people who are saying, clean off

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.640
your rifles.

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:42.520
And then he gives the appearance of saying that, no, you shouldn't.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:47.200
And that is good for him because he can sort of point to that as being like, this is me

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.480
pushing back against the idea of offensive violence.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.480
Totally.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:55.100
Now the next two minutes is him saying a hundred fucking different things that you can't keep

01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:58.560
track of all these various little bullshit pieces.

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:01.000
No, Ezekiel Emanuel wants to kill everybody.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Totally.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Yeah.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Cult, cult leftist doctors.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Bioethics boards.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Psycho killers.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.520
Do cults create bioethics boards?

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.840
Is that a thing I didn't know about?

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:12.200
That's what the new Assassin's Creed is actually about.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.440
God damn Templars.

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:18.160
And then it gets to the end and the message that he's trying to drive home is they're

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.200
coming to kill you.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.200
They're coming to kill you.

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.960
They're coming to kill you.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.720
This is the answer to the beginning of it.

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:31.120
This is him saying, there is no such thing as offensive violence now.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.160
It's not a question of that.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:37.280
Like existentially, this isn't even a question we need to worry about.

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:38.760
All violence is defensive.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:39.760
You got it.

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:44.520
But he doesn't need to actually say that if he structures the argument this way.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:50.400
And if anybody tries to say like, Alex, you're advocating for people to dust off their rifles

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:55.840
and fire at people if they feel like they're vaccine pushers.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.440
A bioethics board is coming for them.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.040
Or someone is telling you to wear a mask.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.040
They're trying to get you to...

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:05.120
Offensive violence, so anything you do to that person is defensive.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:09.200
And if anybody tries to say that Alex, this is what you're saying, he can point to like,

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:13.160
I said that there's a lot of people who are saying clean off the rifles and I was pushing

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.720
back against that idea.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.420
Alex, you are one of them.

01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:17.420
You just did it.

01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:20.800
The larger context of it is the coward's way of saying exactly that.

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:21.800
Just shoot people.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.160
There's no such thing as offensive violence.

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:28.880
But if you do commit one of those crimes, I will say that it's a leftist who did it.

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.920
And that it was offensive.

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:36.000
And then they also handed me a fucking book with a Nazi book market and followed me from

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Florida.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Yeah.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Jesus Christ.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Yeah.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.880
So in this next clip, Alex talks about a conspiracy that I'd like to see him substantiate at all.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:49.840
And the police come and say, you're not allowed to criticize the lockdown and arrest them

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:50.840
and disappear them.

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:54.360
And by the way, a lot of these people, we need to try to get them on Daria.

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:59.840
Remember that Swedish couple was panicking and they come and she was organizing a demonstration

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.800
and they arrested her husband.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:02.800
They'd never been seen again.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:06.200
Last time I heard check on them, same thing in Australia.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.200
They've disappeared.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:11.600
Thousands of people, members of city councils that said, no, we're taking a military base.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.440
Some were never seen again.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.440
What?

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.960
There's a big difference between you not checking.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.280
This is what I'm saying.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.280
This is object permanence.

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.280
Yes.

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.600
If they still existed, we would have heard about them in the news again.

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.600
Yeah.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.600
Since we haven't heard about them in the news.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:26.600
They've never been seen.

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.600
They've been killed.

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:28.600
They've been disappeared.

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:29.960
That's the explanation.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:30.960
Yeah.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:34.520
That's really sloppy.

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:35.520
That's all it takes.

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.520
Yeah.

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:37.520
That's all it takes.

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.520
I would assume.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:42.440
I have not seen my delivery driver for the Chinese food that I got last night for 24

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.440
hours.

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:44.880
And I'm thinking about filing a missing person.

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.760
That's scary.

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:52.520
I would assume that if city council members were being disappeared, there would be openings

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.400
on city councils that were very suspicious.

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.040
We would at least have elections.

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.040
We'd have a runoff.

01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:58.040
Why?

01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:59.040
Because we elected somebody.

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.040
Oh, somebody disappeared.

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:01.040
Don't worry about it.

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.040
Okay.

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:06.800
Would you update their Wikipedia page?

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.040
One thing that would happen there is paperwork.

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.040
Sure.

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:11.040
Yeah, definitely.

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.040
You'd be able to point to something.

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.040
Definitely.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.040
There would be paperwork.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.880
Conspicuous in its absence from any of this is any proof.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:22.120
And when Alex says there's this Swedish couple, they've never been seen again.

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:24.320
We should look into them.

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.520
Like that tells me you haven't.

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:26.520
Yeah.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.520
And you're making that up.

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:28.520
Would you say it?

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:29.520
Yeah.

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.520
So Alex goes to calls.

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.120
He takes some calls.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.840
And one of them he offers a job to.

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:38.560
And this guy is somebody who he'd previously offered a job to.

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:43.360
And he's like, hey, you said give me a half hour show or something.

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:47.640
And Alex is like, oh, yeah, man, we're going to start that up soon.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:51.480
He's still planning on starting that show with callers up soon.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:55.800
But yeah, so here's what this caller's theory is about what the Dems are up to.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:59.280
I feel like the left is winding up their people.

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:03.880
They projected this win so that when Trump does win on the day of the eclipse with December

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:07.720
14th, when it all gets sorted out, I feel like this is going to create bedlam in the

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:08.720
streets.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:12.480
And that's why I feel like they're going right into the COVID news now to create a lockdown

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:16.440
scenario and all those leftist areas to lock those people down, to suppress them even more,

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:19.960
so that they go crazy when Trump wins to really stoke this civil war.

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:24.320
And I feel like that's that's really what they set up so that I totally agree with you.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:25.320
I totally agree with you, sir.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.320
What else do you think's coming?

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:29.720
I feel like what you were saying about the bio attack thing.

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:34.240
I feel like just just going with God here and looking at the alignment and God's handiwork

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.240
here.

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.000
Just there's a great conjunction on December 21st.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.560
Oh, my an apocalypse.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.560
Wow.

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:40.560
It's back.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:41.560
I'm sick of conjunctions.

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.720
Eight years later, it's back sick of conjunctions.

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:47.620
So that eclipse that's happening on December 14th isn't going to be visible in any part

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:51.340
of North America, but they will be able to feel it.

01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:56.840
It's only going to be seen in South America, parts of northern Antarctica and some of southwest

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:57.840
Africa.

01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:02.300
I have no idea why that would be significant in the United States, but go off, whatever.

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:03.760
It's an eclipse.

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.200
Eclipses are global events, Dan.

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.400
It's the sun and the moon and they're doing a whole thing.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:08.720
They're spinning all the time.

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:14.640
I grow weary of these sorts of ideas being brought to Alex's attention and being like,

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.640
I fucking agree.

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:16.640
I fucking love it.

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:17.640
Totally agree.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.640
I'm right.

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:21.600
They're knocking leftists down to whip them up into a frenzy.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:25.580
So whenever Trump definitely doesn't steal the election and wins it outright, they'll

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:28.880
be whipped into an insane frenzy and start the civil war.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.040
And they knew that all of this.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.040
They knew all of it.

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:35.080
They knew they had to do all of this right now because the stars are aligning and there's

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:36.720
an eclipse on December 14th.

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.600
It's the eclipse.

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:40.600
They got to do it.

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.560
You know what I grow weary of?

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:46.800
Anybody who dares take this shit seriously.

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:50.320
Anybody who has the pretense of like, no, he actually has some really good ideas.

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.720
He's really, he's right about more than he's wrong about.

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:53.720
Yeah.

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:54.720
Go fuck yourself.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.720
Fuck yourself.

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.720
You never listen to this show.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:00.480
If you listen to this shit, you'd be like, Oh, God damn it.

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.480
Anybody, anybody.

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:02.880
I challenge them.

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:06.000
If they think that Alex is more right than he's wrong.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
No kidding.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Explain away.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.760
Tell me, tell me about how eclipses are part of the fucking plan.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:16.880
And every civilization's ended because of priests eating people.

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:17.880
Yeah.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:18.880
In only a hundred years.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:19.880
Yeah.

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:20.880
And all of the people are dead.

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.360
To be fair, sometimes it was like a hundred years.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.360
Okay.

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.360
There's different time frames.

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:26.360
Sure.

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.400
But it always ends up with a human barbecue.

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.160
Every civilization that's turned its back to Christ, Dan.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.160
Totally.

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:33.160
It falls apart.

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.160
Yep.

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:38.080
So instead of just handing off the baton to Harrison Smith on this episode, Alex has

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:43.480
a little bit of a fancy maneuver and that is he has Ezra Levant from Rebel Media come

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:47.480
on to host for a couple of segments and then Harrison takes over.

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.480
Nice.

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.480
So Alex still gets to leave early.

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:50.480
Nicely done.

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.120
Ezra Levant is coming up very excited.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:55.680
I'm going to interview him for a segment that I'm, he's a great talk show host, his own

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:56.680
right with Rebel Media.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:00.760
He's going to take over two segments and then we're going to have Harrison Smith and Owen

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:03.400
Schroyer hosting from DC.

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.960
Harrison's back in Austin, Texas.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.040
The interview is not very interesting at all.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.520
And the only other clip Alex has on this show before he leaves, I think is interesting in

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:12.640
any way as this.

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:16.080
But man, I, let me tell you, Trump won on a landslide.

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:20.080
Everyone I know believes Trump won black, white, Hispanic, old, young.

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:23.680
I mean, it's like 60% support Trump.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.640
Everybody knew Trump was working his ass off.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:32.280
No one votes for that dead zombie Biden and Kamala that had half a percent support Democrats.

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:33.280
Everyone hates them.

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:36.280
That's why the globalist chose them because they're such weak puppets.

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:37.540
They can control them.

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:39.640
So I think we have 60%.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:43.840
It's just, we have to convince ourselves that we are the majority and start not complying.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:49.480
This is in reference to a caller who's like 3% in polls believe Trump won the election.

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.480
Yeah.

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:51.880
Alex is like, I think we got 60.

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.440
I think it's a hundred percent.

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:54.440
Yeah.

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:55.440
Oh Jesus.

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.620
So, um, he talks to Ezra Levant.

01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:00.360
It's un-consequential and then the show wraps up.

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:07.160
I think what, what frustrates me the most is that the principle reason that Alex and

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:11.000
the conservatives like Trump is because he's a dick to libs.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Yeah.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.160
Lib tears.

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:17.880
Did it never occur to you that that would motivate libs?

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:18.880
Right?

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:19.880
Uh, yeah.

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.800
Like say, say, okay, fine.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:25.040
Say that nobody's voting for Biden.

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:30.520
The principle factor of your guy is making a lot of people hate him.

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.520
Yeah.

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:32.520
Yeah.

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.520
That's motivating.

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:39.240
And then when you add on like the existential danger that he presents to vulnerable populations,

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:43.160
you can probably galvanize quite a bit of support that way as well.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.160
Yeah.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.160
Uh, yeah.

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.160
It's all just dumb.

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.160
Yeah.

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:51.900
Anyway, on Friday the convoy arrived in DC and at that point it's really kind of pointless

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:54.280
to discuss it as it being its own thing anymore.

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:55.280
Yeah.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:58.200
From that point on the caravan just became another group of participants in the larger

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.680
very sad display in DC.

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:04.880
Here's a little clip of Owen, uh, I guess this is their point now.

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:05.880
Okay.

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:06.880
Yeah.

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:07.880
I've been trying out a new chant actually on this road trip.

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:08.880
You guys want to try this with me?

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:09.880
I think everybody agrees with this.

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:10.880
I'm not sure.

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:11.880
So if you, if you don't agree with this, you can just hang your head.

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:12.880
Government sucks.

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:13.880
Government sucks.

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:14.880
Government sucks.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:15.880
Government sucks.

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:16.880
Government sucks.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:17.880
Government sucks.

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:18.880
Government sucks.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.880
Government sucks.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:20.880
Government sucks.

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:21.880
Government sucks.

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:22.880
Government sucks.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:29.880
I don't know what they're doing.

01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:30.880
Oh man.

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:31.880
I don't.

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:32.880
Oh God.

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:33.880
Yes.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:40.040
We've been wildly obsessed with electoral politics for the last little while and yet

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:45.880
here we are trying to overturn an election while yelling government sucks.

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:51.920
I just, I just, you guys don't understand anything.

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:55.240
Well, I mean, if you want to be anarchist, go for it.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:56.240
No, of course.

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:57.240
But don't do that.

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.240
But they don't want to be anarchists.

01:25:58.240 --> 01:25:59.240
They hate anarchists.

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:00.240
God.

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:01.240
I hate these people.

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:02.240
Yeah.

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:07.320
A government that is not fully in line with exactly what we want in a way that represses

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.440
the people we don't like sucks.

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.440
That's the real chant.

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:11.440
Non-nazis suck.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.440
Yes.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:13.440
Non-nazis suck.

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:19.320
On the one hand, it's only fair that I congratulate Owen for being able to get to DC theoretically

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:20.320
on time.

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:21.320
Lost me 50 bucks.

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:25.540
In hindsight, this was a miscalculation on my part because I thought that they were actually

01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:30.120
planning to do things in the cities that they went to, not just drop in on ongoing rallies

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.700
for about 15 minutes before leaving.

01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:36.020
They were able to achieve their goals on their trip because they had no goals.

01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:38.680
So I guess I just overestimated the project.

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:44.160
You put together that time schedule where I was like, yeah, I would say two hours is

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:46.320
about right for a rally.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.840
You know, you're going to go do some glad-handing.

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.120
Maybe you want to see something in the town too.

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.120
Totally.

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:53.600
Like it's awesome to go around America.

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:57.840
Maybe you go like, and I know from the times that I've been on the road, like there's just

01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:58.840
unexpected shit.

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:00.680
Like you might have to take a shit.

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:05.920
You might have to pull over at a rest stop for a couple minutes and sometimes you might

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:07.120
get lost.

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:12.440
How many times have you been on the road and been like, we're 10 minutes, we're 15 minutes

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.440
off track.

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:14.440
It's the doubling back.

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.440
Now you've lost half an hour.

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:16.440
It's the best.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:17.440
Yeah.

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:18.440
It's the best.

01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:19.440
You might even stop and see the world's largest blank.

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:20.600
It's the best.

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:24.160
I think that they probably weren't on time for most of it, but they did end up pulling

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:26.140
it off and the trip ended up.

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.840
So like, congratulations.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:31.400
I mean, but they set the bar so low for success.

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.560
I had more ambition for them than they did.

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:34.560
Of course we did.

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:35.560
Of course we did.

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:36.560
That's kind of sad.

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.560
This is why we're here.

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:38.560
Yeah.

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:40.880
With that congratulation out of the way, I have to say that this was one of the most

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:45.520
pathetic, dismal, embarrassing, and childish weekends I've ever seen in this country.

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:50.100
The prelude of Alex's completely pointless and poorly attended caravan tour is what made

01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:54.440
me pay closer attention, but if not for that aspect, I think I might have given this entire

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:58.000
million MAGA march nonsense a pass in terms of attention.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Fuck it.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.320
The turnout on Saturday was in the tens of thousands, but nowhere near their goal of

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:08.560
a million people, and well below the 400,000 plus who came to DC for the 2017 Women's March.

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:11.840
It doesn't even come close to the turnout for Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert's rally

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:15.640
to restore sanity and or fear back in 2010.

01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:20.840
There are two pieces of the puzzle here that are important to recognize are both true and

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:23.520
seem at odds with each other, but are not.

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:26.360
The first is that this rally was a horrible failure.

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.920
The turnout wasn't even close to what the organizers and propagandists like Alex would

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:33.720
have wanted, having built this up as their last fight for the country.

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:37.820
The fact that they did a poorly attended caravan leading up to the march only serves to highlight

01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:41.760
how thin the support for their cause is in other cities around the country, even in the

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.120
more conservative leaning south.

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.960
Their attempt at creating optics of the country speaking out in support of Trump has really

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:51.640
only proven that their best shot isn't even a fraction of the people who will come out

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:55.680
to support reproductive rights or civil rights protections.

01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:59.320
There's gonna be excuses for the small turnout, and there'll be pictures that do look like

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:02.120
million people, but they're far less.

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:05.100
There have already been a ton of attempts to use pictures from the Women's March or

01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:08.800
the March for Our Lives protests, which have been erroneously claimed to have been from

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:09.800
this weekend.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:10.800
Naturally.

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:13.720
There have also been edited videos of Trump supporters being attacked, where the context

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:16.580
of them initiating the violence was left out.

01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:20.940
These will be the attempts to salvage what the Trump scammers can from this utter failure

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.540
of a rally.

01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:26.420
The second piece of the puzzle is that the turnout was still way too high.

01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:29.880
And that's because this rally was explicitly radical.

01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:34.040
This was not a political rally, in the sense that like a march supporting the Second Amendment

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:36.720
or a march protesting a tax hike might be.

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:40.200
The only reason this rally was happening is that these people decided to show up to say

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:43.680
they don't want to follow the rules of the country anymore.

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:47.960
Whenever there's a new president elected, the side that doesn't win will often hold

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:52.120
demonstrations, and you're likely to hear people chanting stuff like, not my president,

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:56.120
and I bet you could find small pockets of people in those protests who insist the election

01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:00.180
itself was invalid and the results aren't real.

01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:04.240
This weekend's rally was an entire rally that just consisted of that small pocket, which

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:07.140
is now, I guess, the right wing.

01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:10.180
This rally was a collection of really fucked up weirdos.

01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:14.800
Alex Jones had the Proud Boys giving him security, apparently one of whom had a Pinochet did

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.520
nothing wrong shirt on.

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:20.480
The Oath Keepers may or may not have had men stationed around the city in case shit got

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:21.480
hot.

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:22.480
Great.

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:26.920
Nick Fuentes and his grippers walked around as completely normal participants in the affair.

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.680
QAnon weirdos were all around.

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:29.680
Naturally.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:35.500
This seeming contradiction is the same thing that haunted every stop on the caravan.

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:39.800
In every city, the turnout they got was minuscule compared to the way they present their audience.

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:44.320
Every event they held would be considered a flop by anyone who seriously had the self-image

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:45.860
that they do.

01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:48.680
But they don't mean it when they describe how popular they are.

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:50.240
It's kind of a joke.

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:55.200
They know they're lying, just like Alex does when he says there were 400 cars in the caravan.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.600
That's a lie for the benefit of the listener in the middle of nowhere who thinks they're

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:02.680
hearing dispatches from the front line, not realizing that they're being deceived to sell

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:03.680
them pills.

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:08.080
They don't care that there's no one at the actual rally, because on some level everyone

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:13.320
at Infos has to know that in a sane world, no one would show up at their rallies.

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:17.000
Nine people showing up to send them off in Austin is more than they deserve, based on

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.880
their credibility, work ethic, and integrity.

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:20.880
Indeed.

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.340
This is the same dynamic at the DC rally.

01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:27.440
The turnout is a disaster, if you're looking at it as a sincere attempt at a political

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:28.440
rally.

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:32.040
If you're looking at it for what it is, which is a collection of people living in a completely

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:37.680
fractured reality that's at odds with our reality and sees our reality as hostile, then

01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.480
the turnout should be terrifying in a wake-up call.

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:45.100
Any event that would allow people like Nick Fuentes and Alex Jones to speak on their stages

01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:49.240
is not a political event, and I worry that some people there, or some people who might

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:53.200
have seen coverage of the rally, they might not understand that dynamic, and how extreme

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:55.960
the stuff they're seeing actually is.

01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:59.540
I don't know what to think about what the future holds, but I do have a couple of main

01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:01.780
thoughts that came up.

01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:05.520
The first is that Alex's messaging to his audience is completely out of sync with his

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.160
public behavior.

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:11.280
In this period where he's going to DC and joining in this rally that's trying to reinstall

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:15.400
Trump as the president of the country, he's simultaneously telling his audience that there's

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:19.240
no hope and everyone's gonna die, so everyone needs to head to the hills.

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:22.760
This messaging is discordant, and it kind of gives you the impression that his primary

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:27.160
focus is attention-seeking behavior and selling survival food buckets.

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:31.760
The second is that we are about to be entering a period where fantasies and alternative realities

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:36.240
on the extreme right are going to be coming into large-scale conflict with what I'm going

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:38.160
to call reality.

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:42.440
As more and more excuses for why these fantasies aren't coming true become unconvincing, the

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:44.840
need to escalate will be ever-present.

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:49.300
Whereas before, in his earlier career, Alex could justify his conspiracies by pointing

01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:53.760
to the Federal Reserve, now in the era of Trump, in order to make anything he's saying

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:58.360
make sense, he needs to evoke the literal devil, end-times prophecies, outrageously

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:02.860
complicated and nonsensical conspiracies, and insistences that everyone he doesn't like

01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:04.820
is a pedophile.

01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:09.560
Without strong forces pushing in the opposite direction, this road only leads to deeper

01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:10.560
extremism.

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:13.720
There's no point where someone like Alex will be like, all right, good job, we achieved

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:15.080
our goals.

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:20.040
If he ever reached his impossible-to-attain goal of eliminating all the globalists, I

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:24.340
would bet everything that I own that he'd magically find a new sect of neo-globalists

01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:28.240
and just knock me down with a feather, they all happen to not be white.

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:31.680
What I'm saying is, I'm worried.

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:39.200
Well, I mean, extremism on the right has always been there, obviously, they're the right,

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:41.840
that's kind of their position.

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:48.760
But in electoral politics, you used to be able to give them a bone, like, oh, George

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:52.360
W. Bush lowered the marginal tax rate.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:55.780
That's like a little pressure valve.

01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:57.240
We gotta win.

01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:01.520
The president gave us something, we elected him, and we got the win that we were looking

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:02.520
for.

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:10.160
Now, all of the wins that they want are either imaginary, and so cannot be achieved, or impossible,

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:15.760
and so also cannot be achieved, or we'll kill everyone, so hopefully will not be achieved.

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.680
Well, even the imaginary- So there's no pressure valve, you know, other

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:20.480
than violence, really.

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:25.200
The imaginary and the impossible ones, the practical real-world versions of them are

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:29.680
exactly what it would look like if someone were taking authoritarian rule.

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.680
Exactly.

01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:37.680
It would be like the prosecution, targeted prosecution of the leadership of the opposition

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.680
party.

01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:39.680
Totally.

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:40.680
Yeah, we want Hillary to go to prison.

01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:41.680
That's not going to happen, guys.

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.680
Right, yeah, yeah.

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:47.880
The real-world version of any kind of thing that would be like, ah, yes, we've gotten

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:50.000
what we want, would be-

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.860
Public execution, you know?

01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:56.920
So it's like, there's no pressure release valve.

01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:05.280
And if Trump, if the right hadn't have weaponized imagination, then they could have been like,

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:10.760
oh, well, Trump put up fucking, he dropped environmental protection, so we win.

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:14.480
But nobody gives a shit about that on the right, they just want fucking murder.

01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:18.320
If Alex wants to try and continue his brain, he should just be focusing on the fact that

01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:23.160
Trump got out of the TPP, or whatever, and stay on that talking point and be like, let's

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:24.160
build from there.

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:25.160
But he can't.

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:30.440
And your messaging on the right was never economic anxiety, it used to come off that

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.080
way, but now it's just full-on racism.

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:37.200
So you can't even be like, oh, well, we got out of the TPP because of economic anxiety

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:38.200
or anything like that.

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:39.200
It's like-

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:40.200
Well, you might want to tell the Times that.

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:41.200
Yeah.

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:51.760
I think that it's really worrisome, just the rally itself in DC was worrying.

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.880
This is an attempt to take over fully the GOP, with these scam artists, these Trump

01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:57.880
scam folk.

01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:58.880
Yep.

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.120
And I think that's probably wise of them, I think it's the only thing they can do.

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.640
It's their best shot now.

01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:04.640
Yeah.

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:09.480
Although they'll end up in a turf war with QAnon soon enough, and then they'll fracture

01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:13.500
the party and then Democrats will win every election moving forward.

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:21.640
That's probably our, the most likely outcome of that in the long term is they will eventually

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:22.640
kill each other.

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:24.520
They'll destroy themselves from within.

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:26.680
Or at least diminish their own electoral power.

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.920
Sure, sure, sure.

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:31.320
But I meant metaphysically, metaphorically, not, you know.

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:35.540
But that's like the long term.

01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:37.360
The short term is fucked up shit.

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:38.360
Yes, yes it is.

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:39.360
It's always fucked up shit.

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:40.360
Yes it is.

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:41.360
And it's very scary.

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:42.360
Fuck.

01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:43.360
Yep.

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:44.360
Oh, well.

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:45.360
Anyway.

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:46.360
Hey!

01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:50.200
Much like everything on Knowledge Fight, this Caravanity project has started fun and

01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:52.080
ended up depressing.

01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:53.080
So great.

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:57.320
The good news is, though, in South Carolina they did find a homeless man with a computer

01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:59.960
chip in his hand, but they couldn't get footage of it.

01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:01.560
He gave him that Nazi book.

01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:03.000
Exactly, there's the problem.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.160
That's what happened.

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.680
So I resent this so much.

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:10.160
They ruin my fun.

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:11.160
I just-

01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:12.160
Wanna have fun!

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.600
They just don't understand how to do anything.

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:15.600
Yeah.

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:16.600
Anything.

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:19.820
How much fun would it be if one of the videos is just like, Owen being like, alright, we're

01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:23.720
gonna go to this North Carolina, we're gonna go to this Raleigh event, but you know what?

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:27.320
While we're in town, I'm gonna try and find the best hot dog.

01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:28.320
Totally!

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:29.320
Something!

01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:30.320
Anything!

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:31.320
Something!

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.760
Some personality other than we're angry.

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:34.760
Yeah, yeah.

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:35.760
Wham!

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.320
We're angry and we're sensitive.

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.320
Yeah.

01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:39.320
That's it.

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:42.760
Like we're angry and we're like, please don't hit us with milkshakes, god damn it.

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:43.760
You gotta suck.

01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:45.480
Gotta hit the car wash.

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:46.480
Yeah, oh man.

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:49.920
Anyway, thank you all for joining us on this Care of Vanity project.

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:51.160
Yes, indeed.

01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:55.920
I think that I need a day off, and so I think we will be back at the end of the week.

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:56.920
Yes.

01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:57.920
I think we'll have an episode on Friday this week.

01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.360
I believe so, yeah.

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:04.520
Because I also just don't think that Alex is gonna be, like, back to putting out some

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:08.720
content that I can cover in time for Wednesday's episode or anything.

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:09.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:14.380
And I don't wanna, look, sorry guys, everybody out there, sorry, I don't wanna cover Alex

01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:15.380
going on Tim Pool.

01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:16.380
Yeah!

01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:17.380
I don't wanna cover.

01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:22.440
I don't respect Tim Pool enough to deconstruct an episode of his squirrely ass.

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:26.680
Plenty of people told me that Alex was on Tim Pool and I was like, who the fuck is Tim

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:28.720
Pool and why would I give a shit?

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:29.720
Yeah.

01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:36.880
He's somewhat relevant to the worlds that we cover, but I just, I find him so insufferable.

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:38.280
Yeah.

01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:40.800
And also he seems like somebody who might bother me.

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.800
What type of douchebag is he?

01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:43.440
He seems like the kind of guy who might email me.

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:44.440
Oh, who's gonna try and fuck you.

01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:45.440
If we do an episode about him.

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:46.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:47.440
And I just don't even wanna deal with that.

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:48.440
Okay.

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:52.880
I don't wanna wake up some day and see a notification to Tim Pool wants to debate or something.

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:56.280
I just don't wanna do it.

01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:57.960
So yeah, I don't know, I don't think I'm gonna do that.

01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:01.400
But maybe sometime in the future, maybe as sort of a look back thing, but there's no

01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:02.400
immediacy.

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.960
I have no interest in covering it the same way we might cover Rogan.

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:06.960
Yeah.

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:09.360
Anyway, we'll be back at the end of the week, but until then we have a website.

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.960
We do have a website, it's knowledgefight.com.

01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.920
Yes, we're also on Twitter.

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.760
We are on Twitter.

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.800
It's at Knowledge Underscore Fight and I go do Ben Jordan.

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:17.880
Yep, we're on Facebook.

01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:18.880
We are on Facebook!

01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:20.240
It's a dollar show, right?

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.240
Revive to use this.

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:24.600
And if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:25.600
doing God's work.

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:26.600
Yep, we'll be back.

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:30.240
But until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX Clark, I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:34.240
I am that trucker who threw a milkshake at the dude in the caravan.

01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:35.600
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air.

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:36.600
Thanks for holding.

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.600
Hello, Alex.

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.440
I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan.

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.440
I love your work.

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:46.440
I love you.
