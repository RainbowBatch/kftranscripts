00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
I love you.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,640
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fed, I'm Dan.

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
I'm Jordan.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,720
We're couple dudes that sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
Alex Jones.

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
Jordan.

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Dan!

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
Jordan!

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,720
Quick question for you.

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
What's up?

26
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,720
What's your bright spot today?

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
My bright spot today is, uh, Socratesian.

28
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,720
Socratesian.

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,720
In that it is, uh, know thyself.

30
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,840
Oh, it wasn't just the word Socratesian.

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
No, no.

32
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,640
It is the, uh, the Oracle of Delphi.

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
Okay.

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
Uh, whatever the fuck.

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
Okay.

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm thinking about myself.

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
Yes.

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,480
Um, because I, I started to think about, uh, stuff earlier this week and I was thinking

39
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,520
about like, what do I know about myself?

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,680
And I'm like, well, I like spicy stuff.

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
Sure.

42
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
And I just so happened...

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
That's a good starting point.

44
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,360
I just so happened to have a spice challenge sitting around that we were going to eat on

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
camera.

46
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
Yes, yes!

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
The nuts.

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
No, it wasn't the nuts.

50
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
It was the, uh, the white chocolate bar.

51
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
Oh, the white chocolate bar.

52
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
Oh, shit.

53
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
Lightening, I believe, is the name of it.

54
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
Oh, shit.

55
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,440
And I bought this white, uh, this white chocolate bar that has a bunch of chilis in it.

56
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Sure.

57
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,320
Because I was like, uh, hey, that sounds interesting.

58
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,680
Second, they were giving, uh, meals to charity for every bar that they sold.

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Sure.

60
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
So it was sort of a charity drive.

61
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
I was like, I'll buy this.

62
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
Eh, eh, eh.

63
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
And we'll try it and we'll have some fun.

64
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Yeah.

65
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,720
Now, it was sitting on my counter and I thought to myself, would I enjoy this without an audience?

66
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
That's a good question.

67
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,640
Would I enjoy this spice, like, crazy hot thing without the added element of people

68
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,480
watching me eat it?

69
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,480
Sure.

70
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,920
Can I enjoy this without it being content?

71
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,920
And now we get to know thyself.

72
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Exactly.

73
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
Yes.

74
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
I don't like spicy stuff that much.

75
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,920
Because I ate about half of it alone and I thought it was terrible.

76
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,920
It sucked.

77
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Aw, damn.

78
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,360
I don't know if I'm getting older or what, but, like, it was unpleasant.

79
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,280
I found it to be too much.

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
It hurt.

81
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,800
It's all punctured.

82
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,920
You don't like fucking spicy things.

83
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,420
You don't like seltzers.

84
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,120
You're not gonna like vinegars anymore.

85
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
I do like seltzers.

86
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
Just some.

87
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
All these plants are alive.

88
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
They're all fake.

89
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
They're great.

90
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
All this shit is bullshit, dad.

91
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
It's all about worms now.

92
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Is anybody even actually listening to this show?

93
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
Nope.

94
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
Is this just you and me?

95
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,960
I have all these sock puppet accounts.

96
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,120
Are you trolling me with the greatest troll it is?

97
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,200
I have fake addresses I'm sending buttons to, yes.

98
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,280
That is what's going on.

99
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
No.

100
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
That's a good scam.

101
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,400
I still really like spicy stuff, but I don't like really spicy stuff, I think.

102
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,320
I think that, you know, I don't know, maybe it was late 20s, early 30s, I was in a real

103
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,720
extreme spice kind of place.

104
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

105
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,320
And now- Got your picture on a wall everywhere.

106
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,320
Sure.

107
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
I've achieved.

108
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
Yeah.

109
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
I've achieved something.

110
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Yes, yes.

111
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,700
And I think that maybe it's just over for me, for the extreme spice.

112
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,520
So I will be getting a hot, as opposed to an extra hot, at the Thai place in the future,

113
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
and I think that's okay.

114
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
I agree.

115
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
That is okay.

116
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
I agree.

117
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,840
That is my bright spot, is accepting that about myself.

118
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
I like it.

119
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
How about you?

120
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,520
My bright spot, Dan, is piano solos.

121
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
Okay.

122
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,520
Piano solos is my bright spot.

123
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,480
Well, actually, this is a mix of a great bright spot and a bit of a sad note.

124
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,520
I was listening to- The outro to Layla?

125
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,880
Very, very sad.

126
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,880
Nicely done.

127
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Nicely done.

128
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:26,600
I was listening to Yoko Kanno play the piano solo on Adieu from the Cowboy Bebop soundtrack,

129
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,120
and it's a really, really good piano solo.

130
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,680
Second only to the outro from Layla.

131
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,960
It's very Thelonious Monk in its syncopation.

132
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,600
It's really, really good.

133
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,720
And then I was thinking about my favorite pianist of all time is Keith Jarrett.

134
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
Okay.

135
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Do you know who Keith Jarrett is?

136
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
I do not.

137
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:50,720
He is a jazz pianist who will give these literally hour and a half long improvised piano concerts

138
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
where it's basically just him for an hour and a half, and he's fucking-

139
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,760
Just tickling the 88s.

140
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
Riveting.

141
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,380
His music is beautiful, and he is incredible.

142
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,640
He's a dynamite performer.

143
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
That's great.

144
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,320
And I just found out that he had a stroke.

145
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Oh, no.

146
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,580
Yeah, and he's lost the ability to use his right hand, or I can't remember.

147
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,480
It's one of his hands, though, so he'll probably never play live again.

148
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
Maybe not.

149
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,560
Maybe he'll be the Def Leppard drummer of piano.

150
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,840
If anybody could do it, I'm telling you, he is incredible.

151
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:28,800
So I'm pouring one out for Keith Jarrett's hand until such time as it recovers.

152
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,720
That's very sentimental, and we're wishing the best.

153
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,440
Yeah, if you get the chance, listen to one of his live albums.

154
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:40,520
I want to transition into a less sad thought, more of like, why my brain is bad.

155
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,920
I was thinking the whole time you were talking, we've had pianos for a very long time now.

156
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,840
I can't imagine anyone's doing anything new with them.

157
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Fair.

158
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,120
You're telling me about how great he is.

159
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Okay.

160
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
All right.

161
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Okay.

162
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,720
I was like, yeah, I think we've done the piano stuff.

163
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,840
Let's start talking about numbers.

164
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,000
How many keys does a piano have?

165
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
88, baby.

166
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,320
How many different possible combinations of 88 over any number of measures are there?

167
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,900
Well, I mean, some of them don't sound good.

168
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,760
That's why you're looking for the good ones, man.

169
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Right.

170
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,040
But we've had a lot of time.

171
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Sure.

172
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,000
Just because there are an infinite number of possible combinations.

173
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You say that.

174
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,800
It is because it's true.

175
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Yeah.

176
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,040
I think I might be done with all music.

177
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
We did it, guys.

178
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Yeah.

179
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,040
Wrap it up.

180
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
We got all the music we need.

181
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,760
Now, see, here's why my brain doesn't work again.

182
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,960
You're like, let's talk numbers.

183
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm like, yeah, wait, we've done everything we can with numbers too.

184
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,320
What about the set of infinite numbers?

185
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,960
I'm in a weird head space.

186
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,360
A set of whole numbers is infinite.

187
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,000
Anyway, Jordan, today we've got an interesting episode to go over.

188
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,280
We're talking about November 16th and 17th, 2020.

189
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,720
Dan, this is 2020.

190
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
Sounds good.

191
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Whoa.

192
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
That's right.

193
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Holy shit.

194
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
We're doing it.

195
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Wow.

196
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
You're leaning into the end of the year.

197
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,720
I finally reached it.

198
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
It's 11...

199
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
How many...

200
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
This has been what?

201
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
11 months.

202
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,200
It's been 11 episodes since you started doing Dan, this is 2020.

203
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,400
I got to accept it sooner or later.

204
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Yes.

205
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
It's just how it's got to go.

206
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,320
Sometimes submission is what you need.

207
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,640
Sometimes you need to submit to the universe, and when the universe insists on saying this

208
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
thing, you just kind of have to accept it.

209
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
I'm going to be honest.

210
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:31,000
It feels a little bit like the end of 1984 with this bit here.

211
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,080
I just love the government now, Dan.

212
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,080
Great.

213
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
I'm Dan.

214
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
This is the government.

215
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:44,160
So, this is a stretch of time that I think is a little bit of a stopgap.

216
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,880
We're talking about the beginning of this week, Monday and Tuesday.

217
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
And there's a reason.

218
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,740
And our Monday episode will pick up on Wednesday and go through the rest of the week.

219
00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:00,040
And everybody who's listened to this probably already knows, Alex has gone down to Atlanta

220
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,920
because there's a protest in to do, and he's got to try and stop the steal.

221
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,880
He's on his... and I kind of feel like that's an extension of the caravan.

222
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,760
Alex went down to Georgia looking for an election to steal.

223
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,360
That's what's happening here.

224
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,740
Well, yeah.

225
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,920
So I just... hold on to that thought.

226
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
Okay.

227
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Okay.

228
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,000
Alex is going to Georgia and doing all this stuff.

229
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,080
And I kind of... it's not obviously part of the caravan, and the caravan went through

230
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,000
Atlanta on its way up to DC.

231
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,360
So they've already just been there.

232
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,760
But it kind of has the same spiritual energy of like Infowars on the road.

233
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Right, right, right.

234
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,760
It's a bit of a sequel.

235
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,440
Yeah, so Monday we'll have the sequel of Alex's adventure in Atlanta.

236
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,400
And this is this interstitial period where Alex is back in Austin, in studio, and complaining

237
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,560
a whole bunch.

238
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,560
It's kind of like Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon in The Trip.

239
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Sure.

240
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
Yes.

241
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,200
So we'll get down to business on this episode, but before we do we've got to take a moment

242
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,120
to say thank you to some folks who've signed up and are supporting the show.

243
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
That's a great idea.

244
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,600
So first, Gap Tooth Killah, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

245
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,720
I'm a policy wonk!

246
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,260
Thank you very much, GTK.

247
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,520
Thank you so much next, Andrew G. Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

248
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,780
I'm a policy wonk.

249
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,780
Thanks, Andrew.

250
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,160
Were you about to say Andrew Dice, Clay?

251
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
WK!

252
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,480
Okay, I gotcha.

253
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
All right.

254
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,660
Next, another lunatic.

255
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,640
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

256
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
I'm a policy wonk.

257
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,480
Thank you very much, another lunatic.

258
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,640
Next, Bill and Virginia Warren.

259
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,480
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

260
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,520
I'm a policy wonk.

261
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,440
Thank you very much, Bill of Virginia.

262
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,160
Thank you. Next, Creator, and it's spelled C-R-E-8-H-E-R.

263
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,120
Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk.

264
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,200
I'm a policy wonk.

265
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
Thank you very much, Creator.

266
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,720
Thank you so much. Next, Dave.

267
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,560
Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk.

268
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,640
I'm a policy wonk.

269
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,400
Thank you, Dave.

270
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,960
Thank you, Dave.

271
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,000
I like a good Dave.

272
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,080
Yeah, for sure.

273
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,520
Serengeti.

274
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,000
Do you like the movie, Dave?

275
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,720
No, not a fan.

276
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,040
Ooh.

277
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,440
Had nothing to say and followed up to it.

278
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,280
Nope, nope. We're good.

279
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,280
That's fine.

280
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,960
Next, Tiger High Eats License Plates and Chicom Globalists.

281
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,080
Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk.

282
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,240
I'm a policy wonk.

283
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Thank you very much.

284
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,720
Thank you.

285
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,440
That stuff.

286
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,400
And finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on Elevated Level.

287
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,520
We appreciate that very much.

288
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,080
So, Chris E., thank you so much. You are now a technocrat.

289
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,520
And Sarah McAfee, thank you so much.

290
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,960
You are now a technocrat.

291
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,160
I'm a policy wonk.

292
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,240
Crikey, mate. That's fantastic. Have yourself a brew.

293
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,720
How's your 401k doing, bro?

294
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,480
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

295
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,720
Let's just get down to business.

296
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,800
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

297
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,520
Why you pimps so good?

298
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,480
My neck is freakishly large.

299
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,040
I declare info war on you.

300
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,000
Thank you so much, Chris.

301
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,040
And thank you so much, Sarah.

302
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,520
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

303
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,600
If you're out there listening and you're thinking,

304
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,160
hey, I enjoy the show, I'd like to support these gents.

305
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,240
You can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com,

306
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,400
clicking the button that says support the show.

307
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,080
We would appreciate it.

308
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,040
Indeed, we would.

309
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,640
Or.

310
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,960
Or what you could do if you find yourself filled with a generous spirit

311
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,440
and you need to express that.

312
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,760
Find your way over to a little device that has 88 keys on it

313
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,080
and play one of the 10 approved songs that Dan allows.

314
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,400
And then use that generous spirit to express music in a way

315
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,760
that gets you to local charity or bail fund.

316
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,080
I lost it a little bit at the end because of your bitter rage towards pianos.

317
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,520
You think there's actually 10?

318
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,360
How many would you bet?

319
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,840
Six.

320
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,760
Six?

321
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,160
Anyway, here's an out of context drop from today's show.

322
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,760
Sounds good.

323
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,600
God acts through math, and math tells us that the Democrats cheated.

324
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,160
This is just logic.

325
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,760
This makes sense.

326
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,960
You can't refute that.

327
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,840
I'm just real done with God.

328
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,040
I'm just real done with God.

329
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,880
He acts through math.

330
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,480
So in this first clip where we start off the show,

331
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,600
Alex, boy, I think on our last episode,

332
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
he had to go off air or threatened to go off air twice.

333
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,120
Indeed.

334
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,840
He's now switching it up and just going off air as soon as the show begins.

335
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,720
I like it.

336
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,080
We have massive breaking news.

337
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,040
I actually have to go off air for a few minutes and talk to some insiders.

338
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,520
I'll leave it at that on how the Clintons are now stealing Georgia,

339
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,920
preparing to criminally certify it and how serious the situation is.

340
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
But we have a path forward.

341
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,160
First, I want to play a little bit of my speech yesterday.

342
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,800
Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones,

343
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,520
and my speech from Saturday at the million Trump march

344
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,240
that now they're estimating may have had close to a million people at it.

345
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,960
It's historic.

346
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,200
No, no, no, no, they're not.

347
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,360
No, they're not estimating that.

348
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,840
Who is estimating that?

349
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,320
Him, Alex's.

350
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,560
They is doing a lot of work there.

351
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,560
So Alex is getting this information that they're trying to steal Georgia.

352
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,320
And so as we know, by the end of this, Alex will head to Atlanta

353
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,360
to meet up with Ali Alexander, who's doing the stop the steal thing.

354
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,120
Doing great stuff.

355
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,200
And I wanted to stop you before you started talking about Alex going to Georgia.

356
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

357
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,040
Because I've written a song.

358
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,800
Now, I'm sorry for stepping on.

359
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,520
You are one of six songs.

360
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,800
I do think that this episode is not as good as I want it to be.

361
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,960
There's not as much happening.

362
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,680
Alex is kind of just talking about how Georgia needs to.

363
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,480
It's on his mind.

364
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,600
Yeah, nicely done.

365
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,280
And now it needs to they need to take it over and what have you.

366
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,760
And so I thought as a bonus to the audience and to the people,

367
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,040
yes, I would write my own version of The Devil Went Down to Georgia.

368
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,200
But about Alex and Ali Alexander.

369
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,680
Do you have accompaniment?

370
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,760
No, no.

371
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,560
I want to get a piano.

372
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,240
Certainly not.

373
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,920
Oh, damn it.

374
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,400
I might want to do some mouth sounds.

375
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,240
OK, all right. I'll take that.

376
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,600
Alex went down to Georgia.

377
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,440
He was looking to stop the steal.

378
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,360
His sales were down.

379
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,400
His staff's a clown and the situation is an ordeal.

380
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,680
When he came across this young man spinning a yarn and spinning it hot.

381
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,440
And Alex jumped up on top of his tank and said, boy, let me tell you what.

382
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,320
I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a bullshit artist, too.

383
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,080
And if you care to dare, I'd like to work with you.

384
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,800
Now you spin a mighty fine yarn, boy, but give the Texan his due.

385
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,400
I need your skills to sell my pills, but I'm still better than you.

386
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,600
The boy said, my name's Ali and it might be unwise,

387
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,000
but I'll join your scam to make some clams because I only have shameful allies.

388
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,640
Meter was a little off.

389
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,040
You know what?

390
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,280
I'm going to give that one to you.

391
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,560
Thank you.

392
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,440
Perfect so far.

393
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
Just keep on rolling.

394
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,760
Ali rising up your theories and push your talking points hard

395
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,320
because there's profit to make in Georgia and Alex is a blowhard.

396
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,560
If this works the money and re-noun are all yours,

397
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,880
but if you don't you'll end up working for wars!

398
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,520
Alex mumbled about his obsession with the unborn and flyer.

399
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,800
I might have taken that one from the top.

400
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:50,960
I'm going to be honest with you, you just don't get this from other political podcasts.

401
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
You just don't.

402
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,520
Alex mumbled about his obsession with the unborn and fire flew from his fingertips when

403
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,240
he gripped his tiny bullhorn and he pushed the talk button and there was a static hiss.

404
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:08,020
He'd forgotten to replace the batteries so it sounded something like this.

405
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,600
As Alex fumbled, Ali said, your tech problems are sad, old son.

406
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,440
I know you have a million dollar studio, but let me show you how it's done.

407
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Fraud in the votes.

408
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Run boys, run.

409
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,240
All you have to do is say dominion.

410
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,760
Pretend QAnon shit is solid info.

411
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
Is Roger Stone pulling my strings?

412
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
No child, no.

413
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:34,800
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,

414
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,360
Alex got a miss- I didn't think there was any way there was

415
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
another verse.

416
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
There's a, there's a conclusion.

417
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,360
Sir, you are going for it.

418
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,600
There's a conclusion.

419
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Your commitment to this is fucking fantastic.

420
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
There's a story being told here.

421
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,000
No, I, I'm with you.

422
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,720
Alex got a misty look in his eye because he knew he'd met a friend and he offered Ali

423
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,800
his tiny bullhorn, handing it by the speaker end.

424
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,260
Ali said, can you call Larry Nichols about that congressional blackmail?

425
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,160
And I done told you once, you son of a bitch, stop extending the Easter sale.

426
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:12,920
So, that's, someone put that to music.

427
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:19,000
Before the show, you were telling me, you know what, it's been real hard to do any kind

428
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
of thinky work.

429
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You've been struggling.

430
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Why'd you do that?

431
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,280
Now I realize that it's just been the song.

432
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
It's just been the song.

433
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,320
That took me maybe half an hour.

434
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,200
Uh, yeah, so someone put that to music.

435
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Alex went down to Georgia.

436
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,080
Looking to stop the steal.

437
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,120
DJ Danerkey is going to turn that into an absolute banger.

438
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,800
We're going to get what number one on the billboard charts.

439
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,080
So, uh, the Democrats, they're trying to steal that election in Georgia.

440
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
Why?

441
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
They already won it though.

442
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Well, they're going to steal it.

443
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,400
And they better be, you know, Thursday apparently is the deadline.

444
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
We're recording this on Thursday.

445
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Oh shit.

446
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,520
I have been on the phone with people in the Trump campaign.

447
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:06,240
I've been on the phone with a lot of different top political strategists and for all intents

448
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,760
and purposes, this election could be over for president Trump Thursday, last Thursday,

449
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
hold on.

450
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,440
He'll still not leave office because the fraud is real, but it will give them perception

451
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:25,400
that the election has been certified and it'll make the road towards the lighthouse for the

452
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,640
second Trump term.

453
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,360
And I was taking our country back very, very hard.

454
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,880
Yeah, no shit that will, that will make things more challenging.

455
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Yeah.

456
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Yeah.

457
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Yes.

458
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,200
The process continuing to move along as it's supposed to will make derailing the process

459
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
more difficult.

460
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,720
My car being turned into a cube will make it difficult to drive from here on out.

461
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Yeah, that's true.

462
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,120
That is, that is true.

463
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
Having your wheels taken.

464
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
Yeah.

465
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,120
Yeah.

466
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
It's a hindrance.

467
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

468
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,760
Having my feet cut off will really make it harder to play football.

469
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Yes.

470
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Yeah.

471
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,040
So Alex is not the only one who's heading down to Georgia.

472
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,080
Of course, Ali Alexander is, is going down there.

473
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Sure.

474
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
Some other noted weirdos.

475
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,080
Right.

476
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,520
But Alex thinks that everybody needs to go to Georgia.

477
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Sure.

478
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,120
And I would like to just point out again, I don't, I don't want to keep beating a dead

479
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,280
horse and I love that caravan.

480
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,200
The caravan went to Georgia.

481
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Yes, it did.

482
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,520
And it was, and it was wildly successful.

483
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
You already did.

484
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
No, no, no.

485
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,080
It was wildly successful.

486
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,680
And so they need to do it again.

487
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Sure.

488
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
Okay.

489
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,200
You better start getting on the plane or in the car and heading to the capital of Georgia.

490
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Can't remember what it is.

491
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,560
That is all unfolding right now.

492
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,520
Too many black people live there.

493
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,820
Because we can force the legislature to force the governor to order an emergency session

494
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,000
and not certify it.

495
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,920
The legislature must stand up now with the governor who works for the Clintons, not just

496
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,320
his chief of staff is the problem.

497
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
That's coming up next segment.

498
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,080
I got to refuel though here.

499
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
We need funding.

500
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Yeah, no shit.

501
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Of course.

502
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
Yeah.

503
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
I don't know.

504
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
I find this unconvincing, uninteresting.

505
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Yeah.

506
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm a little bit blown away by the, the level to which they're willing to embarrass themselves

507
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
without actually.

508
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Are you talking about Rudy?

509
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,160
I'm talking about the whole, the whole, the whole kitten caboose.

510
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,760
They're all teaming up to make everything a sick joke.

511
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,340
And it's weird me out because that suggests to me that we're going to have to escalate

512
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,400
from sick joke to full on military takeover or, or they're just going to, I don't know.

513
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,040
You know, he's not just going to go.

514
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
You notice how I escalated.

515
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
I wrote a parody.

516
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Yeah, exactly.

517
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,720
He's not just going to go.

518
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,240
It's not just going to go.

519
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,880
So here we go.

520
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
Let's ride this.

521
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,800
I don't know why everyone's acting like we can just wait and he'll just go.

522
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,060
Well, I think that's one of the good re like the reasons why I'm really glad that our show

523
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,400
is about Alex Jones.

524
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Yeah.

525
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,960
Because at least I know he's full of shit.

526
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,000
I don't know what's going on in terms of other places and that's very scary to me.

527
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,640
So I'd rather not have, uh, you know, an opinion that people take too seriously on it because

528
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
I could be wrong.

529
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Right.

530
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,840
I could misinterpret something with Alex totally fine saying he is full of shit, full of shit,

531
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,000
trying to get attention and push extremist views.

532
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
We can handle that.

533
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah.

534
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,140
And then along the way, sometimes there's something really fun.

535
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,520
Like look, Hey, it's always fun to write a parody song of the devil went down in Georgia.

536
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
True.

537
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
It's been done a lot.

538
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
A lot.

539
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
Cause it's great.

540
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Yeah.

541
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,760
Another thing that's fun is when Alex says things like this.

542
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,540
Imagine a doctor who episode where the Daleks are always little robots rolling around like

543
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,540
R2D2 saying, exterminate, exterminate.

544
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,840
But it said, they said, hello, my friend, I'm here to test you for the COVID.

545
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Oh, sorry.

546
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
You've got it.

547
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
You've got to go away.

548
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,080
That would be a very different villain.

549
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,680
And now they actually in Japan and Europe have Daleks.

550
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,560
They look just like Daleks, right out of Dr. Who, whoever signed it copied a Dalek.

551
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Sure.

552
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,000
And they come up and stick a swab up your nose.

553
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:07,760
And if you don't, an inner hatch opens up and a gun comes up.

554
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,000
I want one of those.

555
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,080
I want one of those right now.

556
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:22,360
I want a swab to gun transfer out of one barrel.

557
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,680
I love that so much.

558
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
All right.

559
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:30,160
So there's this robot that's going around and it's programmed, I guess, because he's

560
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,800
not saying that someone's captaining this robot.

561
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,160
I assume the robot comes up to you and it's supposed to swab you and somehow it's in its

562
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,320
programming that if you refuse, it shakes you down with a gun.

563
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,760
It threatens you with a gun, presumably not shooting you if you then agree to get the

564
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,760
swab.

565
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
No, of course not.

566
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,440
It's traditional carrot and stick.

567
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
All right.

568
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,600
Here's your swab or here's your gun.

569
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,400
Turns out you're going to choose the swab in the end.

570
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Carrot, carrot, stick, swab, gun.

571
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
It's all the same.

572
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,520
It's all the same thing.

573
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
I think...

574
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,760
Why would you even need...

575
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,440
I would prefer a knife.

576
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,220
If it just switched from a swab to a knife and it's like, one of these is going up your

577
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,220
nose today, you choose.

578
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:16,080
These machines would be made by doctors who I assume would not prioritize gun.

579
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:23,320
All right, the head of the Mayo Clinic is a real gun nut.

580
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
Yeah.

581
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,320
All right.

582
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,320
So we're developing this robot that's specifically to test people for COVID to make it so people

583
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,320
don't have to risk getting exposed to run tests.

584
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,120
I feel like you didn't answer my only question.

585
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Of course it has gone.

586
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
See?

587
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Now we're in business.

588
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
I will green light anything.

589
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
This is amazing.

590
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
It's in the news.

591
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,120
I'm going to need a citation on this.

592
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
I'm going to need a source.

593
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
If anybody...

594
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,440
I looked it up, I could not find information on this.

595
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,600
Although I think what he's referring to is that there are robots that are used for COVID

596
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
testing.

597
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Sure.

598
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

599
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,320
In a number of countries, they've rolled out some models of these and I think he's combining

600
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:07,460
that with, there was a crowd control robot in China from maybe last year that they were

601
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,920
working on that would give little shocks to people to try and corral them in different

602
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
directions.

603
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
An R2D2 shock, yeah.

604
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,880
Yeah, I think he's mixing up those two things, but the mental image is so funny.

605
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,960
So if I take this swab, no, I will not.

606
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
What about now?

607
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,760
Now here's the thing that tickles me the most.

608
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
This is what tickles me the most.

609
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,760
The inside hatch.

610
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
The gun comes out.

611
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
That's what it is.

612
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
That's what it is.

613
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
It's so great.

614
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,760
Yes.

615
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
That's what it's so great.

616
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
It's a perfect image.

617
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
It's so fucking funny.

618
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
It's the hatch.

619
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Yeah.

620
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,760
Does it, does it shoot out with a cartoon, like spring, like boing.

621
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
Yeah, of course.

622
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
It's got a robot hand.

623
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Yeah, exactly.

624
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,360
Stick them up.

625
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,760
And then it takes your wallet.

626
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,440
Oh boy, yeah.

627
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,880
Alright, I'm here for a showdown.

628
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,680
So this has been the fun part of the show.

629
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,800
Meet me at high noon.

630
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,360
So now Alex gets into like what, uh, you know, his sort of Georgia story line.

631
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
Okay.

632
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
And this is the big story.

633
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
Lawsuit.

634
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:16,920
Georgia Secretary of State signed a legal deal with Democrats challenging how ballots

635
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
are processed.

636
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:23,800
A law is going to be processed after and allowing mail-in ballots to be counted without actual

637
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,960
proof or signatures being confirmed and it just goes on from there.

638
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,900
This is another classic case of Alex getting a Trump talking point that's factually incorrect

639
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,440
and then it's spiraling out of control when he's recovering it into something else altogether.

640
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,000
In this case, Trump tweeted about how the, how Georgia was stealing the election and

641
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,260
that there had been a consent decree by the Secretary of State that quote, makes it impossible

642
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,840
to check and match signatures on ballots and envelopes, et cetera.

643
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,360
Trump went on to say, quote, they know, uh, they're, they knew they were going to cheat,

644
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,740
must expose real signatures.

645
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,000
This dude's tweeting like a detective in a shitty noir film who's just been shot, scrawling

646
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,040
on a piece of paper, must expose real signatures.

647
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,560
Anyway, I have no idea how a consent decree would make it impossible for people to compare

648
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,900
signatures, but I guess that's the best Trump's people can come up with to keep people like

649
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,040
Alex busy and keep people funneling money into that stopping of steals.

650
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Sure, sure.

651
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,240
In reality, according to the Associated Press, the state absolutely requires signatures to

652
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
match.

653
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,280
The issue comes down to this quote, a lawsuit by the Democratic Party, which led to the

654
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,540
agreement, argued that minorities were disproportionately affected when they had their ballots rejected.

655
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,560
Among other things, the settlement set steps for local election officials to notify a voter

656
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:40,160
by phone, mail, or email in a timely fashion about problems with a signature.

657
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:49,400
Are they really trying to tell me that a state governed by Kemp has not done enough voter

658
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
suppression?

659
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
It's an interesting angle.

660
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Right?

661
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Yeah.

662
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,000
It's like he didn't win the election because it was free and fair, Dan.

663
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,640
Some have said that.

664
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,240
Like maybe if there were paper ballots, we might find out that the results might have

665
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,640
been different.

666
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
It could be.

667
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
Yeah.

668
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,080
And this is just another legal challenge that Trump's camp is making, trying to block the

669
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,100
finalization of the election, but it's going to get thrown out just like all the others.

670
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,840
The only thing I find really interesting here is the dynamic where Alex can't even really

671
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,080
understand what the issue is.

672
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,560
Alex thinks that it has to do with deadlines and votes without signatures, but that's not

673
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
the case.

674
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,800
The legal challenge has to do with whether or not the Secretary of State had the authority

675
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,360
to make the changes that were made, which were designed to create more oversight and

676
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,820
better handling of signature matching.

677
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,960
The suit doesn't seem to even take issue with the actual change that was made, just that

678
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,120
it was allegedly made unilaterally and without proper approval, which is pretty deep in the

679
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,360
weeds in terms of legal challenges to an election.

680
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,080
I'm not surprised Alex doesn't know the details on this.

681
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,540
I wouldn't expect him to, since being aware of how much of a Hail Mary this is would probably

682
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,040
be bad for business.

683
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,920
Can you imagine if that's what did it?

684
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,760
I believe that right before we started recording, this challenge got thrown out.

685
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Yeah, of course.

686
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,960
I believe, if I understand the headline I just saw correctly, I believe this case has

687
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
just died.

688
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,680
It got thrown out the moment the judge realized that it was written in colored pencil.

689
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,680
Wow.

690
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,960
So, can you imagine if that's what, if all of a sudden they were like, oh, the Secretary

691
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,360
of State didn't do it right, so Trump is president again?

692
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,360
That's not how it goes.

693
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,360
No.

694
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,440
That's not how it's going to work for anyone.

695
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,080
I wouldn't assume it would.

696
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:33,520
So obviously, knowing that this is weak, Alex recommends the right course of action, which

697
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,440
is investing in gun robots.

698
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,440
I lied.

699
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,800
It's not.

700
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,960
Everyone must go to the capital of Georgia now, and you must surround the governor's

701
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,960
mansion now.

702
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
I'm coming.

703
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,600
I'll be there.

704
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,460
And I'm bringing Roger Stone, and I'm bringing a bunch of other people.

705
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,460
That's what I'm doing behind the scenes.

706
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,880
And I'm calling the damn White House, and I'm telling Trump he needs to go and get on

707
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,120
a frickin' airplane and land at the capital of Georgia and go into the governor's mansion

708
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,640
and stop sitting there and letting his lawyers do it.

709
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,800
We need to see people power, and this will do it.

710
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Yeah, that's a great idea.

711
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Let Trump storm the governor's mansion.

712
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,360
I think that's a great idea.

713
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,360
I think that's a great idea.

714
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,480
It would look cool.

715
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,840
I think the only thing that would be better, so that one is a great idea, and he should

716
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,840
definitely do that.

717
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,040
And then I think everybody in the Senate should stab him once.

718
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:27,160
I do love the idea that he's like, I'm coming to Georgia, and I'm fucking bringing Roger

719
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,640
Stone with me.

720
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,880
Who cares?

721
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:36,160
I want him to be like, and we're going to settle this election by single comment, combat.

722
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,320
Choose your champion for we have Roger Stone in this corner.

723
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,720
And then the camera pans over, and he's got a lampshade on his head.

724
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,760
Complaining about Elliot Spitzer or some shit.

725
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,800
Yeah, I'll fight whoever you fucking want.

726
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
I don't give a shit.

727
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:56,120
I will only fight if Elliot Spitzer's dad will come against me.

728
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Where's Bongino?

729
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,520
Where's Bongino?

730
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,440
So Alex has a little guest on this episode.

731
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,840
It's not a great sign.

732
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,200
All right, Enrique Torrio is an awesome American.

733
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
Oh no, that's not good.

734
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,980
He's the leader of the Proud Boys, and he was there helping provide security in DC for

735
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,760
us and did an incredible job.

736
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,880
So Enrique Torrio, guy who's the head of the Proud Boys, is on.

737
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Cool.

738
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,040
See, this is the thing that I'm talking about.

739
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,880
How is it that we have the juxtaposition of Rudy Giuliani melting like a fucking candle

740
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,120
in front of us with Enrique Torrio being like, what if we killed all the leftists?

741
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,080
Like that's, you can't have both.

742
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,160
Here's what's interesting.

743
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:42,280
Enrique Torrio is clearly trying to learn a little bit about PR, because he's doing

744
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,400
some heavy lifting on this appearance, trying to give the, like, hey, we just like to hang

745
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
out.

746
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,800
You know, the Proud Boys, we're just like a drinking club.

747
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,880
We just like to have a good time, and hey, we don't just let anybody in.

748
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:01,000
We do extensive background checks on people like Rufio Panman, based stick man, did extensive

749
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,400
background searches, whatever the case.

750
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,120
He's trying to make it look much more respectable, and Alex is actually the one who's kind of

751
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,120
ruining it.

752
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:15,200
You know, when somebody, when a man's down, I don't want to keep attacking him.

753
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,480
These are people that attack women and children, and then as soon as you let them up, they

754
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
attack somebody else.

755
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,480
Yeah, of course.

756
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,320
Once they assault somebody, I think a good, some broken ribs will teach them.

757
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,560
So Alex seems to be the one who's pushing this towards even more extreme, and it seems

758
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:35,520
like a nerd talking to a bully, like interviewing a bully, who's like, oh, isn't it fun how

759
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,520
you kick their asses?

760
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

761
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,560
It's a good thing you're not bullying me.

762
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,800
You were kicking those guys' asses.

763
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
Yeah, it's great.

764
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
That's great.

765
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,000
Well, you know, when I beat people up, I kind of, you know, once they're down, it's kind

766
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
of, that's the end of the fight.

767
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,480
No, you should keep kicking them.

768
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Yeah, Jesus.

769
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Yeah, it's very strange.

770
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,720
Alex is kind of pushing.

771
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,960
You know, what we're trying to do is just show that we're a group of normal people like

772
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
everyone else.

773
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,480
I mean, we have our own political beliefs, but what we do is we get together and we just

774
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,280
share community, just like we do.

775
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,760
I think you should kill people.

776
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
Yeah.

777
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Okay.

778
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,320
Hey, Alex, we've gotten so much bad press, um, and a lot of our members turn out to be

779
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,320
real crazy.

780
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,320
Nazis.

781
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,320
Well, that's one word.

782
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,320
Well.

783
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,760
We do a lot of background checks, but apparently not on that kind of thing.

784
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,320
No, no, they can name a fuck ton of serials though.

785
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,320
That's important.

786
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Exactly.

787
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,320
Look, here's the deal.

788
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,680
We're trying not to do all that shit publicly, all this stuff about kicking people when they're

789
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,680
down.

790
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

791
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,920
We're trying to look different.

792
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

793
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,760
I know that the Oath Keepers and your buddy Stuart Rhodes kind of lean into that.

794
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
We're going to kill you stuff.

795
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Sure.

796
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
It's great.

797
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
We're different.

798
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,680
Alex, Alex, buddy, there are two ways to go.

799
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,520
We're going underground, my friend.

800
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,440
We're going to survive and then we'll kill people again in 10 years or four or whatever.

801
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,000
We'll be, we'll make it through this.

802
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,680
We're not going to go out here all Nazi guns a blazing today.

803
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,440
And Alex is like, what if we're Nazis?

804
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,780
I think if I had to guess, I think it's just like glass half full, half empty in terms

805
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,360
of the DC rally.

806
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,840
I think that Alex is trying to play it like half full, like we are going to take over

807
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,840
the world.

808
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,840
Sure.

809
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
There was a million people there.

810
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

811
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,160
Whereas Enrique Torrio, it's probably like, yeah, it was a lot of people, but it wasn't

812
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
that many.

813
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,880
We can't take over the world with this many people.

814
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
Not enough.

815
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
Yeah.

816
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
Not enough.

817
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,600
So maybe try and put on a face of respectability.

818
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,120
Or invite general Petraeus and see if he'll do us a solid boom.

819
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,760
So Alex is impressed that I, I don't know if this is actually true.

820
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,200
I think it's not, but Alex thinks that no one has ever infiltrated the proud boys.

821
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,680
I don't think that's true.

822
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,360
But he has a theory as to why, and I think it's pretty funny.

823
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,680
I don't know how you guys have kept your organization pretty much infiltration free and how you

824
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,080
guys have done such a great job in the organization.

825
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,480
How do people get involved with proud boys and how are you keeping the organization in

826
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
infiltration free?

827
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,240
I mean, I guess you look at Antifa, they all look like devil-worshipping vampires.

828
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,240
Can't name any serious.

829
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,240
They're total cowards.

830
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
I guess all you guys look pretty macho.

831
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,240
Yeah, they're too macho to infiltrate, you know?

832
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,640
Yeah, leftists are, we just can't look macho enough to infiltrate the proud of us.

833
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,640
Too much soy or something.

834
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,640
Yeah, that's our issue.

835
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,640
Yeah.

836
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,420
So I think that Alex has a pretty consistent thread going of just like really gaslighting

837
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,860
his audience about the crowd size.

838
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:29,120
He's talking about like it's straight up, maybe even a million people there.

839
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,120
Real tough to sell.

840
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
Yeah.

841
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
And then something even more tough happens.

842
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Police estimated upwards of a million bigger than Louis Farrakhan's event.

843
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
Incredible.

844
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,480
We're getting Gavin McGinnis lined up, dealing with some Skype issues.

845
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,480
Oh boy.

846
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,980
Oh, that's a surprise.

847
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,840
First of all, Skype issues, not a surprise.

848
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,960
Second of all, not a surprise that now we're getting Gavin on.

849
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
Oh man.

850
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,540
We're, we're really trying to infiltrate the proud boys, I guess.

851
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:55,360
I have this, I had this interesting experience while I was listening to this episode and

852
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,580
it was largely, oh, okay, we're just going to interview a bunch of people with the proud

853
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,140
boys and extremists and all right.

854
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,140
I'm not interested.

855
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,040
Hey, who else wants to start a war?

856
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,400
You want to start a war?

857
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
Yeah.

858
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Okay.

859
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Yeah.

860
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,360
I'm not super interested except for just to say like, yeah, okay.

861
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,880
I haven't, uh, Gavin and Enrique are talking to Alex and the whole conversation is largely

862
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,440
about everyone's got to go to Georgia.

863
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
Yeah.

864
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,680
It's like, okay, I think this is bad, but I also don't respect Gavin at all.

865
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,680
No.

866
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,920
Uh, I don't, I don't, not really.

867
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
He's not interesting.

868
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,920
He's not funny.

869
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
He doesn't say anything.

870
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,160
Um, so are they trying to drum up like support from the proud boys?

871
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,460
Like, Hey, we're focusing on the proud boys.

872
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,400
The proud boys need to go to Atlanta.

873
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,600
Is that like the, the idea here?

874
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,360
No, I think they're just trying to show a stiff upper lip and sort of like, we're going

875
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:54,280
to be, you can come to Atlanta because the proud boys will be there to fight with you

876
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,640
in case shit goes bad or something.

877
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,080
I think that that's kind of a lot of the message.

878
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
Yeah.

879
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Stop being a coward.

880
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,680
You'll have, they'll have your back.

881
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
Right.

882
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,000
Um, so Alex asks Enrique to define the moment that they're in.

883
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,420
He keeps doing this with people, every single guest.

884
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,560
He asks to define the moment.

885
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
Okay.

886
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,240
Uh, and then something very, very familiar happens.

887
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,080
Enrique Tarrio has taken over proud boys, Gab McGinnis started as an idea to promote

888
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:26,560
family and men and fraternity and unity for American men and American men are under attack.

889
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,440
But now the globalists are so scared of it.

890
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
You've gone through the fire.

891
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,360
You stood up at hundreds of Antifa events for freedom.

892
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,920
You defended so many people.

893
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,000
What would you call Enrique Tarrio?

894
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,440
This historic moment we're at right now.

895
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:47,280
Guys want to put his mic on for him, go ahead Enrique Tarrio.

896
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
Sorry, that was my fault.

897
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,280
Oh, that's our fault.

898
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,280
Go ahead.

899
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,280
It's your fault.

900
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,280
Go ahead.

901
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,280
We don't care.

902
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
We love it.

903
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,280
Technology back and forth.

904
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,280
Go ahead.

905
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Ooh, that happens multiple times.

906
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
Guys.

907
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,280
I think there's some mic muting issues.

908
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,280
Uh, I'm not entirely sure.

909
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
Oh boy.

910
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,520
Anyway, uh, Gavin shows up and we're not going to listen to too much of him because I find

911
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,920
him, uh, unsufferable.

912
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,920
Odious?

913
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Yes, that too.

914
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,280
Uh, but, uh, I just wanted to say that I'm thrilled that he's decided to give up.

915
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,320
We proved it this weekend that we are on the side of what's right and they are on the side

916
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
of what's wrong.

917
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,120
And if you can't see that now, I give up.

918
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,120
Congratulations.

919
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,120
Good, good, good.

920
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,200
Please, please give up.

921
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:32,080
Didn't Gavin come on Alex's show like a year ago saying, fuck this, we're done, give up.

922
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,080
What's the point?

923
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
Yep.

924
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:40,960
Nothing, nothing expresses, uh, you know, just like leader more than any time you lose

925
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,640
moody deciding to quit moody lash outs.

926
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,640
Yeah.

927
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,640
Yeah.

928
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
That's how I want to, I admire it.

929
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640
Yeah, absolutely.

930
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,640
I do not.

931
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,920
I, a lot of people would listen to that and say, I would die for that man.

932
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Anyway.

933
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
Fuck, uh, fuck Gavin.

934
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:02,000
Uh, Owen, Owen Troyer, leader of the caravan comes in and they talk about their huge crowds.

935
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,480
Owen, you did the caravan through the South up to DC.

936
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,680
The police that we talked to estimated, cause I was saying 200,000 that day, cause the police

937
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,680
were saying 200,001 spot.

938
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,560
Turns out that was three and a half miles.

939
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,560
People going back to the beginning of it.

940
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,560
Three and a half miles.

941
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:22,200
They're estimating 800 to 800,000, a million people, and then Antifa attacking at night,

942
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,240
getting their asses kicked, all of it.

943
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,320
What would you describe this moment in history as well?

944
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,560
From the images I've seen sad.

945
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,800
I think that this had more people in attendance than the million man March.

946
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,240
From the images I've seen sure of your caravan.

947
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,560
I've done standup for larger crowds.

948
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,160
And I was a failure.

949
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
Yeah.

950
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
Oh yeah.

951
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
Yep.

952
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,160
Yep.

953
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
Uh, I don't know.

954
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,160
Oh boy.

955
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,780
I don't care about relative size to the million man March either.

956
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,000
They seem really hung up on that.

957
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,040
They really want to make sure that this March is better than other black people's Marches.

958
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,960
It seems like a- It's bigger than Louis Farrakhan's March.

959
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
Why did you choose that one?

960
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,240
It seems like a sticking point.

961
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,520
They brought it up a couple times.

962
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:12,080
Yeah, it seems very important to them that- I would ask you, Jordan, how do you define

963
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
the times?

964
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
How do I define the times?

965
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,080
How do you define this moment that we're in?

966
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,360
I would say pathetic.

967
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
It is sad.

968
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,040
I would say pathetic.

969
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:29,000
I would say that the human race has responded brilliantly and terribly.

970
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,920
At the same time, to the point where, man, I'm really hoping we lose 98% of people and

971
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
get the reefs back.

972
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Do you know what I'm saying?

973
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,900
The 98% of reefs lost?

974
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,640
That's a tragedy.

975
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,960
That's not great.

976
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,120
So Owen has had a revelation lately.

977
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,120
Sure.

978
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,380
This doesn't seem like a revelation.

979
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:55,760
Seems like very similar to catchphrase of Ben Shapiro's kind of.

980
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,760
Great.

981
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,400
I would say that party politic is emotion over evidence.

982
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,580
It's emotion over evidence.

983
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,400
Same thing with the mainstream news, emotion over evidence.

984
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,680
We live in reality.

985
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,680
We live in reality.

986
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,720
A million people out there.

987
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
Nobody got COVID.

988
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,720
Nobody got sick.

989
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
I'm riding back in the airplane.

990
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
Everyone's fine.

991
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
Laughing about the dumb mask thing.

992
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:16,880
They almost kicked me off a plane floor, but we won't go into that.

993
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,040
It's far too soon to know what kind of effect that DC rally is going to have on COVID rates,

994
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,200
but it's not too soon to discuss broader trends that we've seen from past events.

995
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,440
If Trump's rallies throughout 2020 are any indication, Owen may have to eat those words

996
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,760
in the future once data is available.

997
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,280
A report released in October by the Center for American Progress said, quote, analysis

998
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,480
by the Center for American Progress finds that about half of the president's 22 campaign

999
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,920
rallies held between June and September were followed by county level increase in COVID-19

1000
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,600
cases suggesting the events may have led to community spread.

1001
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,560
I don't have data on the recent rally, nor does anyone yet, but I mostly cut out that

1002
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,480
clip because I have a hunch that Owen's going to look pretty bad in hindsight as will this.

1003
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,000
It's like crazy from, from like five blocks up to the Supreme Court, you're, you're packed

1004
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
in like sardines.

1005
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,600
I mean, there's, you can barely even breathe.

1006
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,160
Poor choice of words, I would say there.

1007
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,200
Oh Jesus.

1008
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:21,640
So we end the 16th and we jump into the 17th and this is, this was really strange at the

1009
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
beginning.

1010
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,440
First of all, Alex screws up his, his whole thing, this whole time period between the

1011
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,040
election and the inauguration.

1012
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,640
What do you, what is it?

1013
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,200
79 days of hell.

1014
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Yeah.

1015
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,200
79 days of hell.

1016
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,200
Yeah.

1017
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,200
It's a countdown.

1018
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,880
Day after the election, 78 days of hell left.

1019
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,880
Yeah.

1020
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,880
Alex screws it up.

1021
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,880
Goes backwards on it.

1022
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:47,400
It is now day 64 of the 79 days of hell.

1023
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Communist China and its new allies are desperately trying to overthrow the election of President

1024
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,400
Trump.

1025
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,360
I understand that it's an easy mistake to make, but no one cares about this except you.

1026
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,200
This is not caught on.

1027
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,200
It's not great.

1028
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,240
It's not, no one's going to remember 10 years from now, oh, you remember the 79 days of

1029
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,240
hell.

1030
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,920
You're the one who's pushing this really hard.

1031
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,820
You have to actually get it right.

1032
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,160
You can't say we're on day 64 now.

1033
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,480
There is only 15 days of hell left.

1034
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,720
There's a little bit of a, yeah.

1035
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,120
Oh, is hell going to end on the 30th?

1036
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:24,040
He's trying to count down, but he messed up.

1037
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,040
And that's fine.

1038
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,040
It is fine.

1039
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,040
But it's not.

1040
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,040
No, of course not.

1041
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
This is his baby.

1042
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,040
Anyway.

1043
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
Yeah.

1044
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,720
There was a weird sound and I don't mean like poor quality sound or anything like I really

1045
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,200
felt like Alex is, it sounded like he was reading a commercial at the beginning of this

1046
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,360
episode.

1047
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,480
And now the mainline Republican party has awoken to the truth of the new world order

1048
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,760
and world government and Tucker Carlson is a fancier, more well-produced version of Infowars.

1049
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,440
Not because Tucker Carlson's copying yours truly, but because the world has awoken.

1050
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,280
Yes, the enemy's striking back hard, but my friends, when it comes to the culture war,

1051
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,160
when it comes to recognizing the UN and its true aim of world government depopulation,

1052
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,840
we are winning.

1053
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,440
So didn't that, I mean, that seems, that sounds like a promo.

1054
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,960
Yeah, that was a movie trailer.

1055
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,960
Yeah.

1056
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,800
That was pre, that was LaFontaine all the way.

1057
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
Yeah.

1058
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,040
And I was really thrown by it because it just seemed like, what is going on?

1059
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,520
And then he goes to a couple of like prerecorded reports and I realized he just wasn't there.

1060
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,520
That was prerecorded.

1061
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,520
Oh, that was, okay.

1062
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,520
Yeah.

1063
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,080
Alex shows up 14 minutes into the episode.

1064
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,320
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.

1065
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,120
I've got plenty of important stuff to cover.

1066
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,520
I don't normally start the broadcast with five minutes or six minutes of Tucker Carlson,

1067
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,480
but he knocked it out of the park.

1068
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,280
So yeah, Alex shows up late, I guess he was getting more information about Georgia or

1069
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,280
something.

1070
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,280
Sure.

1071
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,480
There's an interesting dynamic that's going on and I think that though Alex is crazy and

1072
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,080
all this stuff is nonsense, I think he's benefiting from QAnon quite a bit.

1073
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,080
Yeah.

1074
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:05,680
Cause you know, you remember the dynamic that existed, you know, in previous times between

1075
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,280
people like Fox News and Glenn Beck and Alex Jones.

1076
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,240
Alex Jones justified Glenn Beck being crazy because he's like, I'm not Alex Jones.

1077
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,240
Exactly.

1078
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:20,400
He was able to sanitize himself and make himself seem more palatable to a wider audience.

1079
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,000
Yeah, he was a bullshit launderer.

1080
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yeah.

1081
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,320
And because there was someone who could be like, I'm not that guy.

1082
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,520
I'm stepping on that guy in order to make myself look respectable.

1083
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,840
I think Alex now has QAnon to be like, I'm not QAnon.

1084
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,840
That's fair.

1085
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,000
That's a fair point.

1086
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,840
And because everything has just gotten so much worse in terms of public discourse and

1087
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:46,540
people filtering information, like I think, I think he's able to like take advantage of

1088
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:52,520
people thinking that like there's only one person who's wrong at any time or whatever.

1089
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,480
Not realizing QAnon and Alex can be wrong.

1090
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,360
Glenn Beck and Alex are both wrong.

1091
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:02,040
You think, uh, you think QAnon stuff is going to, uh, become leaderless and they're going

1092
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,280
to be like, eh, maybe we'll go back to Alex Jones.

1093
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,280
No, I don't.

1094
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,280
Well, I don't know.

1095
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,360
I don't know what to predict of it, but I think that most of those people are too

1096
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,000
pilled to go back to Alex.

1097
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,800
Too far gone to go back to the light stuff.

1098
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,800
Yeah.

1099
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,720
I think they would find it a little bit disappointing.

1100
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,720
Sure.

1101
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,720
They would find it ungratifying.

1102
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,720
Yeah.

1103
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:27,300
So even though Alex is late, starting the show 14 minutes in or whatever, he did say

1104
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,200
that he has some important stuff to talk about.

1105
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,200
Of course.

1106
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,200
Now generally when he has important things to talk about, it's bizarre fantasies.

1107
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,200
Right.

1108
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,200
Notions.

1109
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,240
Of course.

1110
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,840
Things he's misremembering.

1111
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,840
Half baked anything.

1112
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,840
True.

1113
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,840
Yeah.

1114
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,240
And my, one of my favorite things is reporting Twitter comments as if they're news.

1115
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,240
That's good.

1116
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:53,340
Another comment on Twitter said half the PM and the future head of the state of our country

1117
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,500
have been openly promoting the globalist world economic forum, great recent initiative for

1118
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:02,940
months already, but I cannot find a single mainstream media article in Canada that has

1119
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,540
mentioned or discussed it because you're a slave.

1120
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:09,080
You're not supposed to see all that info.

1121
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:15,240
You're supposed to be preconditioned to the UN world government takeover slogans before

1122
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,160
you ever consciously understand what it is.

1123
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,340
So this is really standard bullshit, but I think it highlights something that's really

1124
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,200
interesting within like Alex and his rhetoric.

1125
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,200
Sure.

1126
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,140
You can easily find articles discussing the ideas presented by Klaus Schwab in references

1127
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:34,040
by name to quote the great reset in media going back to early this year after his book

1128
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,240
was published.

1129
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,660
Just a simple Google search shows that before July, there were articles in Vanity Fair,

1130
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:44,940
the Hill, the Financial Times, Forbes, and plenty of international outlets.

1131
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:50,540
This is the same thing as why aren't there any Muslim voices denouncing terrorism.

1132
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,620
You didn't look for it.

1133
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,260
You assume it's not there.

1134
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:57,520
And now you're making out a conspiracy out of the idea that you haven't found anything.

1135
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,580
There are plenty of people talking about these ideas.

1136
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,060
They were just not places you were interested in.

1137
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,420
They weren't in publications that you maybe normally read.

1138
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,900
The Hill is publicly available.

1139
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:07,900
It's there.

1140
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,980
These articles are there.

1141
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:13,860
If you wanted to, if you had any interest, that discussion's there.

1142
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,720
No one's hiding anything from you.

1143
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,940
You can type questions into the Google search bar.

1144
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,940
True.

1145
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:23,560
So if he's like giving you one of those rhetorical questions, like how come no one's talking

1146
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:28,600
about this, you could type in like how come no one's talking about this and you would

1147
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,600
have to fill in.

1148
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,600
Right.

1149
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:36,140
I think that what's going on is a mis-phrasing of what they believe or what they experience

1150
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,140
as the problem.

1151
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,140
Sure.

1152
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:42,900
They want these ideas to be yelled on the front page of every paper.

1153
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,440
That is what they think they merit.

1154
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,440
It's so important.

1155
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,440
Exactly.

1156
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,820
In the same way that all of Alex's conspiracies whenever it's like the media's not covering

1157
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,660
X, Y, or Z, like there's an article about why you're wrong about this everywhere.

1158
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,020
You can find it if you want.

1159
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,980
They just want this, like the coverage.

1160
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:05,100
The same thing with like no one covers like Trump being good and you can find articles

1161
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,660
and publications about good things Trump's done.

1162
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,700
It's just that no one is bowing down and being like, oh Trump, you're the king.

1163
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,460
They're not covering it the way you want to.

1164
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,920
They're covering these ideas in a real world way as opposed to your way.

1165
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:24,860
And because that isn't, your view isn't being shouted from the rooftops, it's experienced

1166
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,860
as a coverup.

1167
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,580
And that's just not, that's not accurate.

1168
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,580
Yeah.

1169
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:31,460
They're not saying what I want them to say, so they're not covering it at all.

1170
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,460
Exactly.

1171
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:37,300
And I'm not going to look for the articles that would prove my point wrong.

1172
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,820
And that's bad for business, Dan.

1173
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:42,900
Well, the thing that's really sad about it is like, I'm only talking about this phenomenon

1174
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,540
right now because Alex is reading someone's tweet.

1175
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:53,380
Like that's, is there any bad take you can't find on Twitter?

1176
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,540
Like you can find, like that's the situation.

1177
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,400
That's the corollary to your lies about the piano.

1178
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,400
Bees are too good.

1179
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,600
Wait, I bet you could find that.

1180
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,600
Bees are too good.

1181
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,600
Yeah.

1182
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,600
For the environment.

1183
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,600
Exactly.

1184
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,600
Shit.

1185
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,600
Exactly.

1186
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,600
Fuck.

1187
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,600
There's no oil executive somewhere who hasn't tweeted out like let's kill all the bees so

1188
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,620
I don't have to deal with flowers anymore.

1189
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,980
Trying to think of a take that isn't on there.

1190
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:15,980
Candy sucks.

1191
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:16,980
Someone doesn't like candy.

1192
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:17,980
Nope.

1193
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:18,980
Nope.

1194
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:19,980
Definitely there.

1195
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:20,980
It's all there, man.

1196
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,980
It's all there.

1197
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:22,980
If you want to find a bad take, you just search it into Twitter.

1198
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,240
Air tastes bad.

1199
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,240
Of course it does.

1200
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,380
Do you know where air comes from?

1201
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,380
The sky.

1202
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,380
And your butt.

1203
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,380
Exactly.

1204
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,820
Comes out of people's butts.

1205
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,060
That's the only place air comes from.

1206
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,460
So anyway, Ali Alexander shows up.

1207
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,540
And this clip is actually really interesting too.

1208
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:43,820
Like in the same way that last clip really demonstrated this sort of phenomenon of like

1209
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:48,520
not looking for evidence and then claiming there's absence of evidence of something.

1210
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,700
This is another really interesting thing that Alex and his people do quite a bit.

1211
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:57,780
We're really appreciative of all the grassroots work out there, but stoptheseal.us features

1212
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,940
our coalition partners and we're always willing to work with anyone.

1213
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:01,940
Okay.

1214
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,940
Roger.

1215
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,620
There is a phenomenon where then people go get permits.

1216
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,620
Right.

1217
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,460
And then they take over and then say it's their event.

1218
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,460
Exactly.

1219
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,900
We don't care about the event or our name.

1220
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,900
We care about winning.

1221
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:15,060
We care about winning in the Electoral College and getting Donald Trump above 270.

1222
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,860
You know, I happen to be a strategist, so I'm working with all of these folks.

1223
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:23,980
Yeah, we did have a vendor who secured the permit and then decided, oh, well, Alex can't

1224
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:26,460
speak and this person can't speak and that person can't speak.

1225
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,860
And then this shill should speak and this rhino should speak and then made lies about

1226
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:31,860
the Trump family.

1227
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,200
And, you know, that's going to come out later.

1228
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,740
But you know, we're not going to tolerate our movement being hijacked.

1229
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,740
That's right.

1230
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,740
I mean, I talked to the White House.

1231
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,740
Trump, you did too.

1232
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,020
The White House is going to come to find out these people are running it.

1233
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,860
So that's the reason these ladies are a problem.

1234
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:44,860
Right.

1235
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,660
And then in our Georgia event, I announced that and now they're coming to take it off.

1236
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:51,020
So now they put out a flyer that they're going to Georgia and they had Georgia featured as

1237
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,420
a blue state and they misspelled Georgia.

1238
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:57,620
And so so you you and I were first to announce on our independent channels, we're marching

1239
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,620
to Georgia.

1240
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,060
And again, it's not about we don't give a damn about credit credit.

1241
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,020
These people come to us like you really care about.

1242
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,020
Right.

1243
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,020
And then they do media.

1244
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,580
And it sounds like there's a problem with those disgusting freaks because, you know,

1245
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:08,580
they don't present well.

1246
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,740
Look at these disgusting freaks.

1247
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,060
They're responsible for all they did.

1248
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,540
They told you about a stolen election.

1249
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,420
When Owen Schroyer got up to speak, he's saying four more years, Trump on the election.

1250
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,340
They tried to jerk him off the stage and even won a saying that he really won.

1251
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:28,220
So what's going on is that women for America first, that that group got the petition or

1252
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,220
got the permit.

1253
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,220
Yeah.

1254
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,820
And they organized the actual event.

1255
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,820
Right.

1256
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:37,420
It had a list of speakers that didn't include people like Alex.

1257
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,300
And well, they organized the event.

1258
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:44,500
Well, there were a lot of people who also decided to descend on Washington at the same

1259
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,500
time.

1260
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,500
Sure.

1261
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,500
But party crashers don't organize the party.

1262
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:52,980
Well, party crashers are actually more integral to the party than you're willing to.

1263
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,780
There is no party without the crasher.

1264
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,100
That doesn't sound true, but I guess I have to believe you.

1265
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,380
I don't have any evidence.

1266
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,780
Look, why isn't anybody talking about this kind of stuff, Dan?

1267
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:08,220
I find this fascinating because it's the same thing with like, okay, yeah, freedom works,

1268
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:17,420
Americans for Prosperity, Koch money, Koch funds, like Astroturfed a ton of the tea party

1269
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,140
in its early days.

1270
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:24,100
And then Alex glommed onto it and then accused them of taking his movement over.

1271
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,100
Yes, of course.

1272
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,020
And that's exactly what he's doing here.

1273
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,020
Yeah.

1274
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:31,360
And they won't let them hijack their hijack, Dan.

1275
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:38,540
Somebody's crashed this thing in DC and they rightfully probably were like, this is going

1276
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,580
to be tough to deal with.

1277
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:47,380
I understand maybe Alex speaking, but Alex's buddy, I don't know about this.

1278
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:51,400
And then they have the temerity to get on this show and accuse the people who are the

1279
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,420
actual organizers of stealing their event.

1280
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,420
The balls.

1281
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:00,020
And then to be like, they don't present well.

1282
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:07,240
I just like, like Alex does, I really want to like have these clips available just whenever

1283
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,780
I'm just like, oh, women for Trump.

1284
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,500
And it's like, man, you guys don't get it.

1285
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,020
The moment you step out of line, you're no longer for Trump.

1286
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,660
You're just women to them.

1287
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:23,680
And you know how they treat blank, just women.

1288
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:28,620
It is kind of shocking to see, like, so fast.

1289
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,740
You could not have organized that event, Alex.

1290
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:33,900
You could not have.

1291
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,900
We saw the caravan.

1292
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,900
Yeah, exactly.

1293
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1294
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,800
Saw what you were capable of.

1295
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:47,340
The combined work of a ton of grifters added to the population that came to DC.

1296
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:54,820
But the actual event and people having a reason to be there was done by the work of the people

1297
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,540
who you were impugning.

1298
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,540
Yes.

1299
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:01,260
And that's why, like, if you're on the right, so stop trying.

1300
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,260
Just stop it.

1301
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,260
Yeah.

1302
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,260
Stop organizing these things.

1303
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,260
Just stop it.

1304
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,300
The people who want to come and get up there and yell and make you look bad and steal all

1305
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,820
your thunder are going to shit on you later.

1306
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,820
Yep.

1307
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:12,820
Yeah.

1308
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,820
You're being used.

1309
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,820
Yep.

1310
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,820
Every time.

1311
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,820
Oh, well.

1312
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,820
Anyway, Alex.

1313
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,820
No, these are my friends.

1314
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,340
They're not your friends.

1315
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:24,980
Alex is talking to Ali and he wants to know why is Georgia so important?

1316
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,620
Now recap why Georgia is so key.

1317
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,620
Robert Barnes is there.

1318
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:30,420
Everybody that's smart has been telling me for weeks, you're absolutely right, the White

1319
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,420
House agrees.

1320
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,420
George is key.

1321
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,420
How you doing there, buddy?

1322
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,540
So we got a long pause here.

1323
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,540
Alex?

1324
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,500
Alex, we lost you.

1325
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,500
Alex.

1326
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,100
Alex, this is mission command.

1327
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,020
Alex, wake up.

1328
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:48,780
Ground controls have made you tough.

1329
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:49,780
Weird.

1330
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,780
All right.

1331
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:54,860
So then it goes to commercial.

1332
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,180
I thought that was really strange.

1333
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,660
I mean, the feed just went out.

1334
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,660
Yeah.

1335
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,660
And I don't know what happened there.

1336
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,060
They don't address it when they come back, but...

1337
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,060
Too much flute.

1338
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:03,180
But here's the thing.

1339
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,420
I know that probably online that didn't happen.

1340
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,420
Sure.

1341
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:12,100
But I'm listening to it through the feed that goes to all of the radio stations that play

1342
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,980
Alex around the country.

1343
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:19,300
This is what's syndicated to shortwave too, so whoever's listening, it just cut out.

1344
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,300
Which is...

1345
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,340
That's not good.

1346
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,700
That's an audience you care about.

1347
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,160
That certainly, it's not great.

1348
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,980
They could really fix these problems.

1349
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:29,980
Maybe not.

1350
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:30,980
It's doable.

1351
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:31,980
I don't know.

1352
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:32,980
It's doable.

1353
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:33,980
But why?

1354
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,980
That's a good point.

1355
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,980
Anyway, Alex wants to know, where's Trump?

1356
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:36,980
Where's Trump?

1357
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,980
Hiding.

1358
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:38,980
Ally!

1359
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:39,980
Howard, he always was.

1360
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,540
Ally Alexander, tell me where Trump is.

1361
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,540
I hate you guys.

1362
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,540
Let me ask you this question.

1363
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,740
Why aren't we seeing a lot of Trump?

1364
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,140
Because that's his bully pulpit power.

1365
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,140
He still has.

1366
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,140
Why has he been so...

1367
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,380
We saw it tweeting and saying, I won the election yesterday.

1368
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,380
That's not enough.

1369
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,380
I mean, he should be in Georgia.

1370
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,380
He should be having rallies.

1371
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,140
I keep hearing he's going to have these rallies.

1372
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,140
When do those come?

1373
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:00,720
So the rallies were going to come and then there was a compromise reached inside the

1374
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,720
White House.

1375
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,720
So I'm just...

1376
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,200
It's my first time talking about it.

1377
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:09,740
And what they decided was until these cases start making their way through the courts,

1378
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:13,840
Trump does not want to position himself where the courts can hold a tweet against him or

1379
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,360
a rally against him.

1380
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,180
And so his tweets are very concentrated.

1381
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,180
Counterpoint.

1382
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,880
Alex just said that he tweeted the other day that I won the election.

1383
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:22,880
There is that.

1384
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,460
The Democrats are everywhere declaring victory fraudulently, calling him a dictator, but

1385
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,460
he's afraid to speak out.

1386
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,460
Right.

1387
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,460
That's ridiculous.

1388
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,460
And it is ridiculous.

1389
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,460
No, that sounds right.

1390
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:36,540
The courts held during the the ban, the terrorism ban that was described as the Muslim ban,

1391
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,060
they held a tweet against him.

1392
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,980
DACA, they held a tweet against him.

1393
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:42,860
So Trump is trying to play the legal strategy smart.

1394
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:43,860
Counterpoint.

1395
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,580
Trump tweeted, I won the election.

1396
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:49,100
Yeah, that is a really smart strategy, I think.

1397
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,100
Counterpoint.

1398
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,820
Trump tweeted something about Antifa scum.

1399
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,820
Yeah.

1400
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:53,820
Yeah.

1401
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:54,820
He seems to be.

1402
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,460
Your story doesn't hold water, Ali.

1403
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,820
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1404
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,900
You can make up all the fantasy fiction that you want.

1405
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,960
But Trump is a giant, cowardly loser.

1406
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,900
And I assume you guys are going to start killing all of us immediately.

1407
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1408
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,660
Trump wants to get out there, man.

1409
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:11,660
He wants.

1410
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,660
He does.

1411
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,660
No, he wants to play golf.

1412
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:14,660
He wants to get out there.

1413
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:15,660
He wants to do his rallies.

1414
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,660
There's plans to do rallies.

1415
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,660
See?

1416
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:19,300
In the meantime, stop the steal.us.

1417
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:24,920
We will keep posting rallies every state capitol, your noon, your local time until the electoral

1418
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,920
college meets.

1419
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,060
And maybe after that, maybe after that, maybe we never give this country back to them.

1420
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:35,720
He keeps calling it the electoral college, which is fun, but, uh, I don't care who gives

1421
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,720
a shit.

1422
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,720
Yeah.

1423
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,780
But it's like this thing is like, what he's doing is, Hey, yeah, Trump wants to come out

1424
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:41,980
and say hi to the people.

1425
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:45,680
He wants to be the figurehead, but he can't be, he's got to play it smart cause the courts.

1426
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,860
So for now it's just me.

1427
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:48,860
Here's my website.

1428
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:49,860
Wow.

1429
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:55,340
Fund us so we can have demonstrations at every state capitol and never give the country back.

1430
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,340
Whatever that means.

1431
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:57,700
See, I, I get it.

1432
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:02,780
And I understand why everybody is like mocking this and I get why people are writing so many

1433
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:07,780
op-eds and all this stuff that's like, Trump can't do a coup and this is just a grift and

1434
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:08,780
all that stuff.

1435
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:12,020
But it's like this grift is gonna run out.

1436
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:16,420
They don't just stop it when the grift runs out, they create a new grift and whatever

1437
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,420
they need to do.

1438
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:21,980
Whatever they need to do, they will do to continue that grift.

1439
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:22,980
Right.

1440
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:23,980
It's not a joke, man.

1441
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,980
Right.

1442
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:25,980
Right.

1443
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:26,980
Right.

1444
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,820
It is primarily a scam that people like Alex and Allie are running.

1445
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:30,820
Sure.

1446
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:35,900
But the scam, if taken seriously, it's super dangerous.

1447
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,900
Terrifying.

1448
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:44,820
And in the past when it's been a scam that's hurt civilians and normal people, you know,

1449
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,300
it's awful and it is what it is.

1450
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,940
But now it's a game where you could hurt the whole country.

1451
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:50,940
Yeah, the world.

1452
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,940
And yeah.

1453
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,940
Yeah.

1454
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:53,940
Yeah.

1455
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:54,940
The world.

1456
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:55,940
Yeah, it's too much.

1457
00:57:55,940 --> 00:58:00,860
Now, I've had a theory for this whole time that Allie Alexander was working with Roger

1458
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:08,080
Stone on Stop the Steal because it is the same name as Roger Stone's alleged poll watching

1459
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,600
organization from 2016.

1460
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,240
And I didn't need to actually do any further research on it.

1461
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,240
They just told me he was.

1462
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,240
Nice.

1463
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,180
Allie Alexander, a great political analyst and also publisher, is here with us.

1464
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:24,140
He's been a tireless fighter with Roger Stone starting Start the Steal a Few Years ago with

1465
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:27,060
Roger and then Roger's handed the baton to him.

1466
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:28,780
Roger's going to be in Atlanta, Georgia tomorrow.

1467
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,420
I'm going to be there tonight.

1468
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,420
Okay.

1469
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,420
So I was right.

1470
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:33,420
Yep.

1471
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:34,420
This is all connected.

1472
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,420
Yep.

1473
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,420
Yep.

1474
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,940
If Alex is to be believed, which he's usually not.

1475
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,980
True.

1476
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,140
But this seems like something that makes total sense.

1477
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,140
Yeah.

1478
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,140
I mean, it's Roger's domain.

1479
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,140
Yeah.

1480
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:47,780
He was licensed, he registered it, and now he's taken his cut.

1481
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:48,780
Yep.

1482
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:50,460
I have no doubt he's taken a cut.

1483
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,060
Well, and here's the thing.

1484
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:59,100
If this is a conspiracy, all conspirators can be charged with every aspect of a crime.

1485
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,100
Rico.

1486
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,100
Exactly.

1487
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:05,340
So, if Allie follows through with his plan.

1488
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,340
Okay.

1489
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:07,340
Roger might be in trouble.

1490
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,340
Good.

1491
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,340
I'm going to just leak out our plan, Alex.

1492
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:14,260
They've talked about doing, oh, we're going to elect Joe Biden and do a virtual inauguration.

1493
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,260
Good.

1494
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,900
Then Alex and I will fill the streets with 5 million patriots.

1495
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,780
And Trump will be there and we'll inaugurate him, doesn't it?

1496
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,780
We'll inaugurate Donald Trump.

1497
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,060
Because the Democrats said they were going to do that if Trump won.

1498
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,060
Yeah.

1499
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,060
That they would just break the victory up.

1500
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,060
When?

1501
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,060
Well, we're not going to break it up.

1502
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,060
When?

1503
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,060
We're going to reconstitute it.

1504
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,060
Who said that?

1505
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,420
If you guys want to act as insurrectionists, well, then we know how to deal with that.

1506
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:33,740
But we will bring tents.

1507
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:34,860
We will bring trucks.

1508
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,860
We will bring cars.

1509
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:36,860
I agree.

1510
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:40,700
And now is the time after Georgia to start occupying DC, period.

1511
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:45,940
So apparently the plan is occupying DC, which you're going to get bored of very quickly,

1512
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:46,940
Alex.

1513
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,300
You have no ability to run anything like this.

1514
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,300
No, no, no, no.

1515
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:54,220
You have no interest in anything that, especially once the cameras stop, like one of the things

1516
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:59,640
about those kinds of occupations is that they get boring after a while.

1517
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:04,980
People might cover it for a bit and then there's long periods where there aren't cameras, there's

1518
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,740
no attention and you don't have, you're not built for that.

1519
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,260
So no, you're not going to do that.

1520
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:13,100
But assuming that you do, you're not going to get 5 million people to come to DC.

1521
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,100
No.

1522
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,100
That is not going to happen.

1523
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,100
No.

1524
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,940
And let's imagine what's going to happen if you try and inaugurate a second president.

1525
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:20,940
No, that'll work.

1526
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:21,940
No.

1527
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:22,940
Dark Pope.

1528
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:23,940
It'll be fine.

1529
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:24,940
We'll have two Popes.

1530
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,380
Somebody will dig up Biden's remains and put them on trial.

1531
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:27,380
It'd be great.

1532
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:33,420
I'm fascinated by trying- I'm just remembering my medieval warfare

1533
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,420
history.

1534
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:39,140
I remember people writing down, sieges were our favorite part.

1535
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:40,140
You know?

1536
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:45,060
That four months of waiting for supply lines to catch up, sitting there going hungry, not

1537
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,260
fighting anybody, just sitting there in a tent.

1538
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:52,140
I think Alex wants his listeners to do that while buying survival food from him.

1539
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,140
Exactly.

1540
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:54,140
To keep rations.

1541
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:55,140
Of course.

1542
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:58,100
And then Alex will show up with a bullhorn every now and again and take credit for everything.

1543
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,340
Like medieval kings fighting a war.

1544
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,340
Sure.

1545
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,340
Yeah.

1546
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:08,100
So let's try and think about what in the real world would that look like if Alex- I mean

1547
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:12,300
first of all, it's a leap to imagine five million people would show up.

1548
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,780
So let's stipulate that five million do show up.

1549
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,780
Sure.

1550
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,940
Now they decide they're going to inaugurate Trump though he lost the election.

1551
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,940
Well.

1552
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:23,940
What happens then?

1553
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,300
I guess we divide up territories?

1554
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:29,940
I mean, I don't know.

1555
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:33,740
The mind reels.

1556
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,180
Steve Pachanik might get a job.

1557
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:37,460
I'm telling you, I'm just telling you.

1558
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,020
We just got to isolate him.

1559
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,460
We just got to isolate him.

1560
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:42,820
We give him, we give him all Alaska.

1561
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:43,820
It's the biggest state.

1562
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,540
The old werewolf treatment.

1563
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:46,540
Exactly.

1564
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:49,300
Take all of these, take all of them and say, you know what?

1565
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,300
We agree with everything you're doing.

1566
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,700
We love what's going on.

1567
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:53,900
There's a lot of resources in Alaska.

1568
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:56,380
We're going to say- But what about the good people of Alaska?

1569
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,140
We're starting a pilot program.

1570
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:01,700
We want to put your ideas into action, but we're not sure because they're not tried and

1571
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:02,700
tested yet.

1572
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:08,360
So we want to move all conservatives to Alaska and you guys just work it out there and then

1573
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,380
bring it back to us whenever you're ready.

1574
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:13,260
I feel like this is not fair to the people who live in Alaska.

1575
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,260
Oh, that's true.

1576
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:15,260
Yeah.

1577
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:16,260
That is definitely true.

1578
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,260
Oh well.

1579
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:18,260
The moon.

1580
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,260
We'll give Alaskans Hawaii.

1581
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,260
Ooh.

1582
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:23,540
And then we'll give Hawaii to Japan.

1583
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:24,540
Wait.

1584
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,540
This is going to get out of control.

1585
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:27,940
Now I'm trying to rebook everything and it's trouble.

1586
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:30,140
So let's leave that aside for another day.

1587
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:31,140
All right.

1588
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,140
Alex gets it.

1589
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:36,860
He's been doing on this episode his Brian Stelter impression, which is not a good impression.

1590
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:37,860
That one's great.

1591
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,020
Now it's really funny because apparently it's not his.

1592
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:45,260
Brian Stelter goes, there's no evidence and they have none and they shouldn't be on air.

1593
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:49,480
Don't go watch them because we have hours and hours of evidence a day.

1594
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:50,480
It's ridiculous.

1595
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,540
You know, Mark Dies would be proud of that impression.

1596
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:57,300
Well, I mean, I'm not saying Mark ripped me off, he's done a great job, but I was already

1597
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,300
doing it.

1598
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:59,300
I believe that.

1599
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,300
Okay.

1600
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,300
I don't.

1601
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,300
I don't either.

1602
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:03,300
I don't either.

1603
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,300
I don't either.

1604
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,300
I don't either.

1605
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,300
I don't either.

1606
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:07,300
Alex stole Brian Stelter impression from Mark Dies.

1607
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,300
Sad.

1608
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:11,340
The thing that always makes me feel like an alien to these people is what they laugh at.

1609
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,340
Yeah.

1610
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:15,140
Like, was that that funny?

1611
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:17,060
What did you laugh at, Ali?

1612
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,660
What did you laugh at?

1613
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,420
Was it just that he did a voice?

1614
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,300
I think so.

1615
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,300
And if so.

1616
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,300
Ooh.

1617
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:31,940
Yeah, well, I mean, I think that that was one of the challenges of doing standup was,

1618
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,820
first of all, not thinking the things that I said were that funny.

1619
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:35,820
Sure.

1620
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:36,820
That's a big challenge.

1621
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:37,820
And often the audience agreeing.

1622
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:38,820
Yeah.

1623
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:43,580
And then, you know, things that I saw other people say that weren't all that funny and

1624
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,220
audiences thinking they were hilarious.

1625
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:46,220
Sure.

1626
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:47,860
You know, people have different senses of humor.

1627
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:48,860
There's no accounting for that.

1628
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:49,860
Totally.

1629
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:50,860
And it's bewildering.

1630
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:51,860
Yeah.

1631
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:56,980
I'll tell you a few that the stuff on InfoWars that is humorous to those folks who are on

1632
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,980
as guests.

1633
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:02,380
It's worse than anything, most things that I've seen at comedy shows.

1634
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,900
Yeah, it feels alien.

1635
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:04,900
It really does.

1636
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:11,140
Because in comedy, you know, you've seen every kind of, I've seen the gamut of people trying

1637
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:14,220
to be funny all across the board.

1638
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:18,540
And even they have nothing, there's nothing like this.

1639
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:24,540
This is just a series of people who only understand each other and laugh at these weird things

1640
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:27,380
that are just divorced from reality.

1641
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:28,380
Yeah.

1642
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:29,380
It's wild.

1643
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:36,380
I mean, so much of comedy and so much of what you find funny is the ability to understand

1644
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:41,260
sort of shared perceptions or shared ideas.

1645
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:47,340
And I think once people have such fractured realities that they live in, it makes sense

1646
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,300
that humor wouldn't translate at all.

1647
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1648
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,300
Between them.

1649
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,300
Yeah.

1650
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,300
That's sad.

1651
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,580
How could you make a joke about the sun rising if they're like, we've never seen the sun and

1652
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:57,580
it's dark all the time.

1653
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,580
And you're like, okay.

1654
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:59,580
It'd be tough.

1655
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:01,980
There's no shared point of commonality.

1656
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:05,140
So in this next clip, Ali yells that he's signing his death warrant and he's going to

1657
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:07,780
fight this thing all the way to his grave.

1658
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:11,860
And so all of these guys, I'm so proud to be working with you, Alex, and you, Ed.

1659
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:13,180
We've got to rush the gates.

1660
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:18,740
We've got to be the barbarians that rush the gates in the castle, or we're all dead.

1661
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:19,740
It's really that simple.

1662
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:22,220
So I'm signing my death warrant.

1663
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:24,140
It's liberty or it's death.

1664
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:26,460
Alex, I think you're in the same boat.

1665
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,820
Oh, I'm total commitment.

1666
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:30,980
Every cell in my body is commanding me to take action.

1667
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:32,740
I'm not in control.

1668
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:38,180
I just remembered when he got sued by Chobani and Alex said, I will fight this.

1669
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:40,620
I will win or I will die.

1670
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:43,360
I will win or he settled a week later.

1671
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:46,180
I'm real sorry about that stuff that I did.

1672
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:48,180
I will win or die.

1673
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:49,180
That's you know what?

1674
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:50,860
A error of my ways.

1675
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:55,580
Look, Hamdi Ulukaya, I am so sorry that I said those things about you.

1676
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:56,580
Please don't sue me.

1677
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:57,580
Please don't sue me.

1678
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:58,580
Uh, okay.

1679
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,580
Alex, whatever.

1680
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:00,580
Oh boy.

1681
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:01,580
Anyway, uh, Ali leaves.

1682
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:05,460
I guess he's got to head down to Georgia for Alex to meet him down there.

1683
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:11,700
And Alex takes some calls and this is such a fucking performance on Alex's part.

1684
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:17,460
I believe that what's going on here is that Alex thinks that this caller is nuts and he

1685
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:18,900
doesn't want to talk to him.

1686
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:21,940
So he decides to pretend to be mad about something else.

1687
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:23,700
Dave in Nevada.

1688
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,700
You're on the air, Dave.

1689
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:26,700
Yes.

1690
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:32,900
My topic is predictions on the coronal mass ejection, uh, brain shifts and the report.

1691
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,920
You see, you know, we're not screening your call.

1692
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,500
You're actually on air live right now.

1693
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,500
Sure.

1694
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,500
Oh, put you on hold, put you on hold.

1695
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,580
Listen, I have a thing, I put you on hold, I have a thing about callers.

1696
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:46,980
I love you to death, but I'm not other talk shows where I pre-screen you for an hour.

1697
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:47,980
Want to have you a clean phone.

1698
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,140
You want to tell us what you're calling in about a scrape.

1699
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:53,220
Once you get on air, you tell us what you want to cover.

1700
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,860
You don't have to ask permission, sir.

1701
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:55,860
He wasn't.

1702
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:57,620
He was telling you what his topic was.

1703
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:58,940
Coronal mass ejection.

1704
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:03,860
His phone sounded fine compared to the callers that you generally have on this show.

1705
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:04,860
Real easy.

1706
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:09,180
He wants to talk about predicting coronal mass eject ejections, brain chips.

1707
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:10,180
Yep.

1708
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:12,660
And I think Alex was like, I don't want to fucking talk to this dude.

1709
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:13,660
Nope.

1710
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:14,980
I want to get mad at him for no reason.

1711
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:15,980
Exactly.

1712
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,540
And then it continues.

1713
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:20,620
Once you get on air, you tell us what you want to cover.

1714
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,900
You don't have to ask permission, sir.

1715
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:26,020
If you ask for permission, I will hang up on you.

1716
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:28,780
That's the one rule is no censorship and no screening.

1717
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,100
Let's try again, Dave.

1718
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,100
I love you.

1719
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,100
Go ahead.

1720
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,100
You're free man, brother.

1721
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,100
Go ahead.

1722
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,100
It's okay.

1723
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,100
This is going to sound like numerology.

1724
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,100
Okay.

1725
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:40,100
You just asked for permission again, dude.

1726
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,100
Don't do it.

1727
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,100
Did he?

1728
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,100
Just go.

1729
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,540
He did not ask for permission again.

1730
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:50,020
He's he was giving a caveat that this is going to sound like numerology, but I was more preamble

1731
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,020
than anybody else.

1732
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:52,020
Yeah.

1733
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:54,020
That was, that was softening the numerology that was about to come.

1734
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:55,020
Yeah.

1735
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,020
Yeah.

1736
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:57,020
This is going to sound like numerology because it is.

1737
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:59,620
But if I say this is going to sound like numerology, maybe you'll think it isn't.

1738
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:00,620
Yeah.

1739
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,460
Maybe you'll think that I'm more of a rational actor in this whole thing.

1740
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,460
Yeah.

1741
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:06,180
I think just as like, yeah, all right, I don't want to do this.

1742
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:09,780
I don't want to take whatever this guy's saying seriously, but you know, whatever.

1743
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:15,060
I'll just get mad about my weird idea about anti-censorship of phone calls.

1744
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:16,060
Yeah.

1745
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:17,060
Very strange.

1746
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,060
Sure buddy.

1747
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,060
Very strange.

1748
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:23,780
So Alex takes another call and this guy wants you to not take a vaccine.

1749
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:30,860
And then thankfully Alex starts talking about his idea of this karma and the whole sort

1750
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:34,820
of thing about like, you need, the globalists need to trick you into doing things for moral

1751
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:35,820
reasons.

1752
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:36,820
Galactic law.

1753
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:37,820
Sure.

1754
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:41,100
And Mike down for this cause you might get a little confused cause it's confusing.

1755
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,100
Fair.

1756
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:46,800
But this is perhaps the only thing that like really fascinates me about Alex anymore.

1757
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,900
This idea of his bizarre ethical system.

1758
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:54,140
They can dial up the radiation and they can inject you with anything they want to.

1759
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:59,900
You got to make sure that you don't take anything that, that, that they're pushing out and don't

1760
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:03,620
feel they can spray it on you, but metaphysically they get the bad karma.

1761
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:04,700
They believe from it.

1762
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:05,980
They need you to agree.

1763
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:11,940
They can pressure you, but they need you to agree so they don't get at least the instant

1764
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:12,940
karma.

1765
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:13,940
It's how the dimensions work.

1766
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:14,940
I don't understand it all.

1767
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:15,940
They know it's a law.

1768
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:16,940
So do I.

1769
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:17,940
You make somebody do something.

1770
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:18,940
You get instant karma.

1771
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:24,660
You get interdimensional karma when you die for sins, even if you manipulated the field

1772
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:29,820
or however it works, but they need to trick us to go along with it and at least acquiesce.

1773
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:31,340
That's their satanic operation.

1774
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:34,300
They need us like in the garden to agree to it.

1775
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,300
Does that make sense?

1776
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,940
No, not, not, not one bit.

1777
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:38,940
Nope.

1778
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:45,560
So if I understand correctly, instant karma isn't after you die.

1779
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,560
That is like now.

1780
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,260
No, it's instant karma, right?

1781
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,460
Which is real.

1782
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:54,660
So, but I don't think that history backs that up.

1783
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:55,660
No, it does.

1784
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:56,660
No, it doesn't.

1785
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,660
I don't think it does.

1786
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:01,660
What about all the monsters who died in their beds?

1787
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:04,860
Oh, but you missed out all the instant karma that did happen.

1788
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:05,860
Oh, sure.

1789
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:06,860
Like they stubbed their toe?

1790
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:07,860
Exactly.

1791
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:08,860
Great.

1792
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:09,860
Yeah.

1793
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:10,860
Great.

1794
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:11,860
Instant karma.

1795
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:12,860
I don't think that this works.

1796
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:15,020
I think you're going to have a really tough time explaining how this system has ever operated.

1797
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,020
Sure, sure.

1798
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:17,020
Human history.

1799
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:18,020
Sure.

1800
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:22,980
Especially if you go back to like times when, like feudal times.

1801
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:26,380
How did instant karma work back then?

1802
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:28,580
When life was cheap in the back ages.

1803
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:33,180
So do you remember, so there was a, I can't remember, but it was, I can't remember if

1804
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:38,420
it was Roman or if it was not, but I feel like in my head it's Roman.

1805
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:39,860
The metal bull.

1806
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,740
Do you remember the metal bull?

1807
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:42,740
The golden bull.

1808
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:48,100
And they would put a human being inside the bull and light the fire underneath it, making

1809
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:52,900
that person burn alive inside of the bull while the king laughed.

1810
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,540
I feel like you're talking about Game of Thrones.

1811
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:56,140
No, this is not Game of Thrones.

1812
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:57,140
It's real.

1813
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:58,140
Okay.

1814
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:03,180
And that guy absolutely had diarrhea that night.

1815
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,220
And that's what happens.

1816
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,220
Instant karma, Dan.

1817
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,220
Sure.

1818
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:08,220
It's, it's tough.

1819
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:09,220
Yeah.

1820
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:12,180
It's tough for me to wrap my head around this.

1821
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:17,820
Now Alex seems to also be saying that even if you manipulate the system and get people

1822
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:25,140
to do things of their own volition, you'll still have bad sin karma after you die.

1823
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:26,140
Of course.

1824
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,140
Well naturally.

1825
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:28,140
What?

1826
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:33,060
Haven't you seen the scoreboards that follow us around everywhere and sit on top of our

1827
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,060
left shoulder?

1828
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,660
Am I the only person who can see the scoreboard?

1829
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:36,660
I think so.

1830
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,660
Oh shit.

1831
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,660
Cause this makes perfect sense to me.

1832
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:39,660
You and Alex.

1833
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,460
If you look at this scoreboard right over here.

1834
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:48,940
I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit worried about the real world application of this moral

1835
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:49,940
system.

1836
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:50,940
Sure.

1837
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:52,420
I'm a little bit worried about it.

1838
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:58,860
For one, if you believe this moral system and then let's say you violate someone's free

1839
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:01,540
will and then there's no instant karma.

1840
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:03,460
Oh my God.

1841
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,620
I must not have violated their free will.

1842
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:06,620
Uh oh.

1843
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:07,620
There we go.

1844
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:08,620
This could teach you the wrong lessons.

1845
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,960
I wasn't instantly karmad.

1846
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,620
So furthermore, furthermore, here's the biggest issue.

1847
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:15,620
You know what?

1848
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:20,200
That kind of implies is that anything that you do, if God doesn't strike you down for

1849
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:27,180
doing it, it must be okay until after when you find out, well, but then it's not like

1850
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:28,180
instant karma.

1851
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,180
It's just bad.

1852
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,180
It's not that bad.

1853
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,180
No, no, no.

1854
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,700
Whatever you did to somebody they must've been fine with or else God would have given

1855
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:35,700
you instant karma.

1856
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:36,700
Of course he would.

1857
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:39,880
So the fact that you're still standing and don't have, what the fuck?

1858
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:44,220
I think my biggest issue is that they can quote pressure you.

1859
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:45,220
Yeah.

1860
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:46,220
Now what does that mean?

1861
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,220
Wow.

1862
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:48,900
What are the limits of pressure?

1863
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:53,380
They can pressure you into agreeing with them, but they'll still be in trouble after they

1864
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:54,380
die.

1865
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:56,780
They'll just not have instant karma if they pressure you.

1866
01:12:56,780 --> 01:13:00,940
So they can just, they can just torture you endlessly until you agree.

1867
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:07,220
What if they send a robot with a gun and a little...

1868
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:11,060
Cause I would say that's not pressure.

1869
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:12,060
Is Dalek pressure?

1870
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:13,060
I think that's the question.

1871
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:16,340
I think Alex is saying that it is, but it's absolutely not.

1872
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:17,340
All right.

1873
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:25,180
If the globalists have to get you to agree to do things, Dalek's with guns is not pressure.

1874
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:30,020
That's force.

1875
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:31,020
That's pressure.

1876
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:32,020
No, it's not.

1877
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:33,020
That's just pressure.

1878
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:36,500
Now, if the gun actually kills the person, that's instant karma.

1879
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,060
But as long as you're just pressuring them with the threat of shooting them.

1880
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:42,780
The threat of the gun is not pressure.

1881
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:44,280
Not instant karma, that's pressure.

1882
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,020
That's an inappropriate level of pressure.

1883
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:48,900
Well, see, that's why I don't like when he says pressure.

1884
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:54,500
I think it is debatable, you know, the whole idea of like, did I make you do something

1885
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,900
cause I pointed a gun at you?

1886
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:56,900
Sure.

1887
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,680
Like if I make you rob a store when I'm pointing a gun at you, are you morally culpable or

1888
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,900
should you have gotten shot instead of...

1889
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:03,900
Sure, sure, sure.

1890
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:04,900
Actually, this is a stupid conversation.

1891
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:05,900
It is.

1892
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:06,900
Of course I forced you to do it.

1893
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:07,900
Yeah.

1894
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:08,900
Naturally.

1895
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:09,900
You got a gun on me.

1896
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:10,900
Yes.

1897
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:15,340
So the robot with a gun is not pressure, that's force.

1898
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:19,700
This moral system makes no sense, but I want Alex to talk about it for an hour.

1899
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:23,980
Honestly, I think even a robot with a swab is maybe force.

1900
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:26,800
A robot comes up to you with a swab?

1901
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,500
That's a little bit intimidating.

1902
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,620
I mean, it's weird.

1903
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:32,920
If there's no gun, it's not force.

1904
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,700
You could just then walk away from the robot.

1905
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:38,660
It's not Rosie the main robot from the Jetsons.

1906
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:41,340
But if it's a Dalek, you can outrun it.

1907
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:42,340
Close a door.

1908
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:43,500
No, Daleks can fly.

1909
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,500
Not these ones.

1910
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,500
Not real ones.

1911
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,500
Not real ones.

1912
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:49,220
Alright, well, I'll have to call Matt Smith and see what he can do about this.

1913
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:54,300
Anyway, I just want Alex to do a fucking whole special episode about this weird moral system.

1914
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:55,300
Gotta.

1915
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:59,460
And I'd love him to do like a call-in show where people can ask him questions to refine

1916
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:00,460
some of these ideas.

1917
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:01,460
Absolutely.

1918
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:02,460
I want him to have a chalkboard.

1919
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,220
I think it would fall apart so fast.

1920
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:06,500
I really want him to try and explain it.

1921
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:10,020
I really do, because it is bonunkers.

1922
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:16,940
So now Alex takes another call, and something happens that happens more than I would like

1923
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:20,860
to admit, and that is this caller tells Alex about a dream he had.

1924
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:21,860
Oh, of course.

1925
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:22,860
Thanks, sir.

1926
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:23,860
I'll take my call, brother.

1927
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:24,860
Yes, sir.

1928
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:30,580
Alex, I just wanted to reiterate a dream I had approximately 16 years ago.

1929
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:32,360
A dream goes like this.

1930
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,860
I had crossed a gigantic cavern.

1931
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,220
I don't know how I crossed it.

1932
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:37,220
I didn't know where to go.

1933
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:38,940
And I laid down on my back.

1934
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:44,400
I looked up to heaven, and I saw a blue spiraling light, and this blue spiraling light turned

1935
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,520
into like a tornado.

1936
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:52,060
And out of that blue spiraling light, a dove formed, a blue dove.

1937
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:57,180
And I felt liquid love raindrops going entirely through me.

1938
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:02,220
And a voice like a trumpet spoke to me and said, a moment is only for a moment, but a

1939
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:04,140
moment lasts forever.

1940
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:07,940
And Alex, this is America's moment to stand up.

1941
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:11,760
If this moment is missed, this moment will pass forever.

1942
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:16,060
There's a shelf life on it, and kudos for you for going to Georgia today.

1943
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,060
They're right.

1944
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:21,300
It's a dimensional jump point where they've liquefied the energy field for the future,

1945
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:23,620
and we have to remold things now.

1946
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,300
What are those words?

1947
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,180
They've liquefied the jump gate?

1948
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,180
What are you talking about?

1949
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:29,180
Of course.

1950
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:30,180
Of course.

1951
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:31,180
Fuck off.

1952
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:32,180
They liquefied the jump gate.

1953
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:34,380
I had a dream that I was skateboarding last night.

1954
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:36,500
Anyway, this guy apparently-

1955
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:43,740
I got to tell you about a dream I had 16 years ago, so I was 17 years old, and I had this

1956
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:44,740
dream-

1957
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:45,740
Look, I love you.

1958
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:46,740
You're my best friend.

1959
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:47,740
I don't want to hear your fucking dream.

1960
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:48,740
No, no, no.

1961
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:49,740
You want to hear this dream.

1962
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:50,740
It's really incredible.

1963
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:51,740
No, no.

1964
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:53,420
So I had this dream, and there was this cat, and it was climbing up a tree.

1965
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:54,660
You know like cats do.

1966
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:58,000
And then I saw this blinding light, and so did the cat.

1967
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,660
And you know the cat saw it because the light blinded the cat so much that it fell, and

1968
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:06,460
it was holding onto the tree just by its bare paws.

1969
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:12,300
And a deep, booming voice said, hang in there, kitty.

1970
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:14,260
And I just always hung onto that, Dan.

1971
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:15,660
Well, it's a meaningful thing.

1972
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:17,140
It's a meaningful thing.

1973
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:23,620
I like the idea that some people are going to maybe protest outside capitals and be like,

1974
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:24,620
the time is now.

1975
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:29,900
I mean, or else why would that guy who called Alex Jones' show have had that dream 16 years

1976
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:30,900
ago?

1977
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:31,900
That's ludicrous.

1978
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:36,700
I just want to reiterate a dream I had 16 years ago.

1979
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:39,660
Is the last sentence I want to hear anyone say ever.

1980
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:43,820
I have to assume Alex in that moment was like, I'm so mad I freaked out at that caller earlier.

1981
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:45,820
I should have freaked out at this guy first.

1982
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:46,820
God damn it.

1983
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:47,820
I should have saved the freak out.

1984
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:49,460
I blew it too soon.

1985
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:54,220
Anyway, we have one last clip, and it's sort of an intro to our Monday episode.

1986
01:17:54,220 --> 01:18:01,620
Well, I'm on my way, and I'm not the devil, just a little bit, but I love Jesus.

1987
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:07,340
And so I'm on my way to Georgia, and I'm going to be with Roger Stone, Ollie Alexander, and

1988
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:09,340
so many others fighting the steel.

1989
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:10,340
Very exciting.

1990
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:15,980
Join us Monday on Knowledge Fight as we discuss Care of Vanity Project part three.

1991
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:17,300
The Texan went down to Georgia.

1992
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:21,060
He was looking for a stop the steel.

1993
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:27,000
So I'm excited about that kind of, I'm excited about the idea of like, I'm playing by my

1994
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
own rules.

1995
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,700
Like, we're going to cover this show, but I think a bottle episode where we talk about

1996
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:38,100
his time in Georgia makes more sense than us covering Wednesday at the end of this episode.

1997
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,100
Agreed.

1998
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,500
Like the caravan, perfect two-parter.

1999
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,500
Makes total sense.

2000
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,500
Absolutely.

2001
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,500
And let me tell you something.

2002
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:48,500
I shot on it a little bit, but that was a very well-written parody song.

2003
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,500
Thank you.

2004
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,500
That was very well-written.

2005
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,500
It was a good parody song.

2006
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,060
I will be genuine for this one moment.

2007
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:54,420
This is very nice of you to say.

2008
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:58,020
I will admit, in hindsight, there were some meter problems.

2009
01:18:58,020 --> 01:18:59,820
There were a couple big ones.

2010
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:04,260
That's the problem whenever you write it out and you don't sing it, you know, perfectly

2011
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:05,260
in advance.

2012
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:06,260
Yeah.

2013
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:09,460
I mean, I might've reread it.

2014
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:19,540
Anyway, I think that this was a little bit of a preamble episode in some ways.

2015
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:23,860
I feel like this was getting ready to go to Georgia.

2016
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:29,100
And it's this, he's just got back from DC and now he's about to leave again.

2017
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,220
There's this weird middle place where it's like, fuck, I don't know, I'm going to hang

2018
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:35,060
out with Ali Alexander and all the Proud Boys.

2019
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:37,020
Yeah, it's a layover in the airport.

2020
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,020
Yeah, kind of.

2021
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:39,020
But it's his home.

2022
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:40,020
Yeah.

2023
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:43,540
He is a nomad for the 79 days of hell.

2024
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:48,980
He is a man adrift running around the country, hither and yon, trying to find attention wherever

2025
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:49,980
it might be.

2026
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:52,420
He is going to have to do that, I guess.

2027
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,420
Yeah.

2028
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:54,420
That's like what he's got to do.

2029
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:59,980
I will say, on the one hand, I'm glad it doesn't come off as desperate.

2030
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:00,980
I guess.

2031
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:03,140
I was being facetious.

2032
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:08,380
Anyway, we'll be back on Monday, but until then, we have a website.

2033
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:09,380
We do have a website.

2034
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:10,380
It's knowledgefight.com.

2035
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:11,380
You bet it is.

2036
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:12,380
We're also on Twitter.

2037
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,380
We are on Twitter.

2038
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,900
It's at knowledge underscore fight and at go to bed Jordan.

2039
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:17,040
We are on Facebook.

2040
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,040
We are on Facebook.

2041
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:23,100
And if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

2042
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,580
doing God's work right now.

2043
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:25,580
Yeah.

2044
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:26,580
We'll be back.

2045
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:27,580
But until then, I'm Neo.

2046
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:28,580
I'm Leo.

2047
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:29,580
I'm DZX Clark.

2048
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:30,580
I'm Daryl Rundis.

2049
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:33,780
We accept all callers except for censored.

2050
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:34,860
I don't know how to do this one.

2051
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:35,860
I fucked up.

2052
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:36,860
Sorry.

2053
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:37,860
Andy in Kansas.

2054
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:38,860
You're on the air.

2055
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:39,860
Thanks for holding.

2056
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:40,860
Hello, Alex.

2057
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:41,860
I'm a first time caller.

2058
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:42,860
I'm a huge fan.

2059
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:43,860
I love your work.

2060
01:20:43,860 --> 01:21:10,820
I love you.
