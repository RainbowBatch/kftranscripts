00:12.880 --> 00:19.600
Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.160
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

00:25.160 --> 00:29.320
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying, we are the bad guys.

Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

00:50.600 --> 00:55.160
Hello, Alex, I'm a freshman in college, I'm a huge fan, I love your room.

00:55.160 --> 00:56.640
Knowledgefight.com.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.640
I love you.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.640
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fed, I'm Dan.

01:00.640 --> 01:01.640
I'm Jordan.

01:01.640 --> 01:04.720
We're couple dudes that sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about

01:04.720 --> 01:05.720
Alex Jones.

01:05.720 --> 01:06.720
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

01:06.720 --> 01:07.720
Jordan.

01:07.720 --> 01:08.720
Dan!

01:08.720 --> 01:09.720
Jordan!

01:09.720 --> 01:10.720
Quick question for you.

01:10.720 --> 01:11.720
What's up?

01:11.720 --> 01:12.720
What's your bright spot today?

01:12.720 --> 01:13.720
My bright spot today is, uh, Socratesian.

01:13.720 --> 01:14.720
Socratesian.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.720
In that it is, uh, know thyself.

01:17.720 --> 01:19.840
Oh, it wasn't just the word Socratesian.

01:19.840 --> 01:20.840
No, no.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.640
It is the, uh, the Oracle of Delphi.

01:22.640 --> 01:23.640
Okay.

01:23.640 --> 01:24.640
Uh, whatever the fuck.

01:24.640 --> 01:25.640
Okay.

01:25.640 --> 01:26.640
I'm thinking about myself.

01:26.640 --> 01:27.640
Yes.

01:27.640 --> 01:31.480
Um, because I, I started to think about, uh, stuff earlier this week and I was thinking

01:31.480 --> 01:33.520
about like, what do I know about myself?

01:33.520 --> 01:35.680
And I'm like, well, I like spicy stuff.

01:35.680 --> 01:36.680
Sure.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.680
And I just so happened...

01:37.680 --> 01:38.680
That's a good starting point.

01:38.680 --> 01:43.360
I just so happened to have a spice challenge sitting around that we were going to eat on

01:43.360 --> 01:44.360
camera.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.360
Yes, yes!

01:45.360 --> 01:46.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.360
The nuts.

01:47.360 --> 01:48.360
No, it wasn't the nuts.

01:48.360 --> 01:49.360
It was the, uh, the white chocolate bar.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.360
Oh, the white chocolate bar.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.360
Oh, shit.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.360
Lightening, I believe, is the name of it.

01:52.360 --> 01:53.360
Oh, shit.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.440
And I bought this white, uh, this white chocolate bar that has a bunch of chilis in it.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.440
Sure.

01:56.440 --> 01:59.320
Because I was like, uh, hey, that sounds interesting.

01:59.320 --> 02:03.680
Second, they were giving, uh, meals to charity for every bar that they sold.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.680
Sure.

02:04.680 --> 02:05.680
So it was sort of a charity drive.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.680
I was like, I'll buy this.

02:06.680 --> 02:07.680
Eh, eh, eh.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.680
And we'll try it and we'll have some fun.

02:08.680 --> 02:09.680
Yeah.

02:09.680 --> 02:15.720
Now, it was sitting on my counter and I thought to myself, would I enjoy this without an audience?

02:15.720 --> 02:16.720
That's a good question.

02:16.720 --> 02:23.640
Would I enjoy this spice, like, crazy hot thing without the added element of people

02:23.640 --> 02:25.480
watching me eat it?

02:25.480 --> 02:26.480
Sure.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.920
Can I enjoy this without it being content?

02:28.920 --> 02:30.920
And now we get to know thyself.

02:30.920 --> 02:31.920
Exactly.

02:31.920 --> 02:32.920
Yes.

02:32.920 --> 02:33.920
I don't like spicy stuff that much.

02:33.920 --> 02:41.920
Because I ate about half of it alone and I thought it was terrible.

02:41.920 --> 02:42.920
It sucked.

02:42.920 --> 02:43.920
Aw, damn.

02:43.920 --> 02:49.360
I don't know if I'm getting older or what, but, like, it was unpleasant.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.280
I found it to be too much.

02:51.280 --> 02:52.280
It hurt.

02:52.280 --> 02:54.800
It's all punctured.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.920
You don't like fucking spicy things.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.420
You don't like seltzers.

02:58.420 --> 03:00.120
You're not gonna like vinegars anymore.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.120
I do like seltzers.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.120
Just some.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.120
All these plants are alive.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.120
They're all fake.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.120
They're great.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.120
All this shit is bullshit, dad.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.120
It's all about worms now.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.120
Is anybody even actually listening to this show?

03:09.120 --> 03:10.120
Nope.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.120
Is this just you and me?

03:11.120 --> 03:13.960
I have all these sock puppet accounts.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.120
Are you trolling me with the greatest troll it is?

03:16.120 --> 03:19.200
I have fake addresses I'm sending buttons to, yes.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.280
That is what's going on.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.280
No.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.280
That's a good scam.

03:22.280 --> 03:27.400
I still really like spicy stuff, but I don't like really spicy stuff, I think.

03:27.400 --> 03:33.320
I think that, you know, I don't know, maybe it was late 20s, early 30s, I was in a real

03:33.320 --> 03:35.720
extreme spice kind of place.

03:35.720 --> 03:36.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.320
And now- Got your picture on a wall everywhere.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.320
Sure.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.320
I've achieved.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.320
Yeah.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.320
I've achieved something.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.320
Yes, yes.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.700
And I think that maybe it's just over for me, for the extreme spice.

03:47.700 --> 03:54.520
So I will be getting a hot, as opposed to an extra hot, at the Thai place in the future,

03:54.520 --> 03:55.520
and I think that's okay.

03:55.520 --> 03:56.520
I agree.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.520
That is okay.

03:57.520 --> 03:58.520
I agree.

03:58.520 --> 04:01.840
That is my bright spot, is accepting that about myself.

04:01.840 --> 04:02.840
I like it.

04:02.840 --> 04:03.840
How about you?

04:03.840 --> 04:06.520
My bright spot, Dan, is piano solos.

04:06.520 --> 04:07.520
Okay.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.520
Piano solos is my bright spot.

04:09.520 --> 04:14.480
Well, actually, this is a mix of a great bright spot and a bit of a sad note.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.520
I was listening to- The outro to Layla?

04:16.520 --> 04:17.880
Very, very sad.

04:17.880 --> 04:18.880
Nicely done.

04:18.880 --> 04:19.880
Nicely done.

04:19.880 --> 04:26.600
I was listening to Yoko Kanno play the piano solo on Adieu from the Cowboy Bebop soundtrack,

04:26.600 --> 04:29.120
and it's a really, really good piano solo.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.680
Second only to the outro from Layla.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.960
It's very Thelonious Monk in its syncopation.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.600
It's really, really good.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.720
And then I was thinking about my favorite pianist of all time is Keith Jarrett.

04:39.720 --> 04:40.720
Okay.

04:40.720 --> 04:41.720
Do you know who Keith Jarrett is?

04:41.720 --> 04:42.720
I do not.

04:42.720 --> 04:50.720
He is a jazz pianist who will give these literally hour and a half long improvised piano concerts

04:50.720 --> 04:54.240
where it's basically just him for an hour and a half, and he's fucking-

04:54.240 --> 04:55.760
Just tickling the 88s.

04:55.760 --> 04:56.760
Riveting.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.380
His music is beautiful, and he is incredible.

04:59.380 --> 05:00.640
He's a dynamite performer.

05:00.640 --> 05:01.640
That's great.

05:01.640 --> 05:04.320
And I just found out that he had a stroke.

05:04.320 --> 05:05.320
Oh, no.

05:05.320 --> 05:09.580
Yeah, and he's lost the ability to use his right hand, or I can't remember.

05:09.580 --> 05:12.480
It's one of his hands, though, so he'll probably never play live again.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.480
Maybe not.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.560
Maybe he'll be the Def Leppard drummer of piano.

05:15.560 --> 05:20.840
If anybody could do it, I'm telling you, he is incredible.

05:20.840 --> 05:28.800
So I'm pouring one out for Keith Jarrett's hand until such time as it recovers.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.720
That's very sentimental, and we're wishing the best.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.440
Yeah, if you get the chance, listen to one of his live albums.

05:34.440 --> 05:40.520
I want to transition into a less sad thought, more of like, why my brain is bad.

05:40.520 --> 05:44.920
I was thinking the whole time you were talking, we've had pianos for a very long time now.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.840
I can't imagine anyone's doing anything new with them.

05:47.840 --> 05:48.840
Fair.

05:48.840 --> 05:51.120
You're telling me about how great he is.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.120
Okay.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.120
All right.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.120
Okay.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.720
I was like, yeah, I think we've done the piano stuff.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.840
Let's start talking about numbers.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.000
How many keys does a piano have?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
88, baby.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.320
How many different possible combinations of 88 over any number of measures are there?

06:06.320 --> 06:09.900
Well, I mean, some of them don't sound good.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.760
That's why you're looking for the good ones, man.

06:11.760 --> 06:12.760
Right.

06:12.760 --> 06:14.040
But we've had a lot of time.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.040
Sure.

06:15.040 --> 06:19.000
Just because there are an infinite number of possible combinations.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
You say that.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.800
It is because it's true.

06:21.800 --> 06:22.800
Yeah.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.040
I think I might be done with all music.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.040
We did it, guys.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.040
Yeah.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.040
Wrap it up.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.040
We got all the music we need.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.760
Now, see, here's why my brain doesn't work again.

06:31.760 --> 06:32.960
You're like, let's talk numbers.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.920
I'm like, yeah, wait, we've done everything we can with numbers too.

06:36.920 --> 06:42.320
What about the set of infinite numbers?

06:42.320 --> 06:43.960
I'm in a weird head space.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.360
A set of whole numbers is infinite.

06:46.360 --> 06:51.000
Anyway, Jordan, today we've got an interesting episode to go over.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.280
We're talking about November 16th and 17th, 2020.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.720
Dan, this is 2020.

06:54.720 --> 06:55.720
Sounds good.

06:55.720 --> 06:56.720
Whoa.

06:56.720 --> 06:57.720
That's right.

06:57.720 --> 06:58.720
Holy shit.

06:58.720 --> 06:59.720
We're doing it.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.720
Wow.

07:00.720 --> 07:01.720
You're leaning into the end of the year.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.720
I finally reached it.

07:02.720 --> 07:03.720
It's 11...

07:03.720 --> 07:04.720
How many...

07:04.720 --> 07:05.720
This has been what?

07:05.720 --> 07:06.720
11 months.

07:06.720 --> 07:10.200
It's been 11 episodes since you started doing Dan, this is 2020.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.400
I got to accept it sooner or later.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.400
Yes.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.400
It's just how it's got to go.

07:14.400 --> 07:19.320
Sometimes submission is what you need.

07:19.320 --> 07:23.640
Sometimes you need to submit to the universe, and when the universe insists on saying this

07:23.640 --> 07:24.640
thing, you just kind of have to accept it.

07:24.640 --> 07:25.640
I'm going to be honest.

07:25.640 --> 07:31.000
It feels a little bit like the end of 1984 with this bit here.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.080
I just love the government now, Dan.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.080
Great.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.080
I'm Dan.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.080
This is the government.

07:36.080 --> 07:44.160
So, this is a stretch of time that I think is a little bit of a stopgap.

07:44.160 --> 07:47.880
We're talking about the beginning of this week, Monday and Tuesday.

07:47.880 --> 07:48.880
And there's a reason.

07:48.880 --> 07:53.740
And our Monday episode will pick up on Wednesday and go through the rest of the week.

07:53.740 --> 08:00.040
And everybody who's listened to this probably already knows, Alex has gone down to Atlanta

08:00.040 --> 08:04.920
because there's a protest in to do, and he's got to try and stop the steal.

08:04.920 --> 08:08.880
He's on his... and I kind of feel like that's an extension of the caravan.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.760
Alex went down to Georgia looking for an election to steal.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.360
That's what's happening here.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.740
Well, yeah.

08:14.740 --> 08:18.920
So I just... hold on to that thought.

08:18.920 --> 08:19.920
Okay.

08:19.920 --> 08:20.920
Okay.

08:20.920 --> 08:25.000
Alex is going to Georgia and doing all this stuff.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.080
And I kind of... it's not obviously part of the caravan, and the caravan went through

08:29.080 --> 08:32.000
Atlanta on its way up to DC.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.360
So they've already just been there.

08:34.360 --> 08:38.760
But it kind of has the same spiritual energy of like Infowars on the road.

08:38.760 --> 08:39.760
Right, right, right.

08:39.760 --> 08:40.760
It's a bit of a sequel.

08:40.760 --> 08:45.440
Yeah, so Monday we'll have the sequel of Alex's adventure in Atlanta.

08:45.440 --> 08:51.400
And this is this interstitial period where Alex is back in Austin, in studio, and complaining

08:51.400 --> 08:52.560
a whole bunch.

08:52.560 --> 08:55.560
It's kind of like Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon in The Trip.

08:55.560 --> 08:56.560
Sure.

08:56.560 --> 08:57.560
Yes.

08:57.560 --> 09:00.200
So we'll get down to business on this episode, but before we do we've got to take a moment

09:00.200 --> 09:02.120
to say thank you to some folks who've signed up and are supporting the show.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.120
That's a great idea.

09:03.120 --> 09:06.600
So first, Gap Tooth Killah, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.720

I'm a policy wonk.

09:15.780 --> 09:16.780
Thanks, Andrew.

09:16.780 --> 09:18.160
Were you about to say Andrew Dice, Clay?

09:18.160 --> 09:19.160
WK!

09:19.160 --> 09:20.480
Okay, I gotcha.

09:20.480 --> 09:21.480
All right.

09:21.480 --> 09:22.660
Next, another lunatic.

09:22.660 --> 09:24.640
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

09:24.640 --> 09:25.640
I'm a policy wonk.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.480
Thank you very much, another lunatic.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.640
Next, Bill and Virginia Warren.

09:29.640 --> 09:31.480
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.520
I'm a policy wonk.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.440
Thank you very much, Bill of Virginia.

09:34.440 --> 09:40.160
Thank you. Next, Creator, and it's spelled C-R-E-8-H-E-R.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.120
Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.200
I'm a policy wonk.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.400
Thank you very much, Creator.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.720
Thank you so much. Next, Dave.

09:45.720 --> 09:47.560
Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.640
I'm a policy wonk.

09:48.640 --> 09:49.400
Thank you, Dave.

09:49.400 --> 09:49.960
Thank you, Dave.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.000
I like a good Dave.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.080
Yeah, for sure.

09:52.080 --> 09:52.520
Serengeti.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.000
Do you like the movie, Dave?

09:54.000 --> 09:54.720
No, not a fan.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.040
Ooh.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.440
Had nothing to say and followed up to it.

09:59.440 --> 10:00.280
Nope, nope. We're good.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.280
That's fine.

10:02.280 --> 10:05.960
Next, Tiger High Eats License Plates and Chicom Globalists.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.080
Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.240
I'm a policy wonk.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.240
Thank you very much.

10:10.240 --> 10:10.720
Thank you.

10:10.720 --> 10:11.440
That stuff.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.400
And finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on Elevated Level.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.520
We appreciate that very much.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.080
So, Chris E., thank you so much. You are now a technocrat.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.520
And Sarah McAfee, thank you so much.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.960
You are now a technocrat.

10:21.960 --> 10:23.160
I'm a policy wonk.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.240
Crikey, mate. That's fantastic. Have yourself a brew.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.720
How's your 401k doing, bro?

10:27.720 --> 10:30.480
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

10:30.480 --> 10:31.720
Let's just get down to business.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.800
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.520
Why you pimps so good?

10:35.520 --> 10:37.480
My neck is freakishly large.

10:37.480 --> 10:40.040
I declare info war on you.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.000
Thank you so much, Chris.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.040
And thank you so much, Sarah.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.520
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.600
If you're out there listening and you're thinking,

10:44.600 --> 10:46.160
hey, I enjoy the show, I'd like to support these gents.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.240
You can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com,

10:48.240 --> 10:49.400
clicking the button that says support the show.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.080
We would appreciate it.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.040
Indeed, we would.

10:51.040 --> 10:51.640
Or.

10:51.640 --> 10:55.960
Or what you could do if you find yourself filled with a generous spirit

10:55.960 --> 10:57.440
and you need to express that.

10:57.440 --> 11:01.760
Find your way over to a little device that has 88 keys on it

11:01.760 --> 11:06.080
and play one of the 10 approved songs that Dan allows.

11:06.080 --> 11:11.400
And then use that generous spirit to express music in a way

11:11.400 --> 11:13.760
that gets you to local charity or bail fund.

11:13.760 --> 11:18.080
I lost it a little bit at the end because of your bitter rage towards pianos.

11:18.080 --> 11:21.520
You think there's actually 10?

11:21.520 --> 11:23.360
How many would you bet?

11:23.360 --> 11:23.840
Six.

11:23.840 --> 11:24.760
Six?

11:24.760 --> 11:27.160
Anyway, here's an out of context drop from today's show.

11:27.160 --> 11:27.760
Sounds good.

11:27.760 --> 11:32.600
God acts through math, and math tells us that the Democrats cheated.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.160
This is just logic.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.760
This makes sense.

11:37.760 --> 11:38.960
You can't refute that.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.840
I'm just real done with God.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.040
I'm just real done with God.

11:42.040 --> 11:42.880
He acts through math.

11:42.880 --> 11:45.480
So in this first clip where we start off the show,

11:45.480 --> 11:49.600
Alex, boy, I think on our last episode,

11:49.600 --> 11:52.600
he had to go off air or threatened to go off air twice.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.120
Indeed.

11:53.120 --> 11:56.840
He's now switching it up and just going off air as soon as the show begins.

11:56.840 --> 11:57.720
I like it.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.080
We have massive breaking news.

12:00.080 --> 12:04.040
I actually have to go off air for a few minutes and talk to some insiders.

12:04.040 --> 12:07.520
I'll leave it at that on how the Clintons are now stealing Georgia,

12:07.520 --> 12:11.920
preparing to criminally certify it and how serious the situation is.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.920
But we have a path forward.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.160
First, I want to play a little bit of my speech yesterday.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.800
Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones,

12:17.800 --> 12:21.520
and my speech from Saturday at the million Trump march

12:21.520 --> 12:24.240
that now they're estimating may have had close to a million people at it.

12:24.240 --> 12:24.960
It's historic.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.200
No, no, no, no, they're not.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.360
No, they're not estimating that.

12:28.360 --> 12:29.840
Who is estimating that?

12:29.840 --> 12:31.320
Him, Alex's.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.560
They is doing a lot of work there.

12:33.560 --> 12:37.560
So Alex is getting this information that they're trying to steal Georgia.

12:37.560 --> 12:41.320
And so as we know, by the end of this, Alex will head to Atlanta

12:41.320 --> 12:45.360
to meet up with Ali Alexander, who's doing the stop the steal thing.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.120
Doing great stuff.

12:46.120 --> 12:50.200
And I wanted to stop you before you started talking about Alex going to Georgia.

12:50.200 --> 12:50.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:50.880 --> 12:54.040
Because I've written a song.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.800
Now, I'm sorry for stepping on.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.520
You are one of six songs.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.800
I do think that this episode is not as good as I want it to be.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.960
There's not as much happening.

13:04.960 --> 13:08.680
Alex is kind of just talking about how Georgia needs to.

13:08.680 --> 13:09.480
It's on his mind.

13:09.480 --> 13:10.600
Yeah, nicely done.

13:10.600 --> 13:14.280
And now it needs to they need to take it over and what have you.

13:14.280 --> 13:17.760
And so I thought as a bonus to the audience and to the people,

13:17.760 --> 13:21.040
yes, I would write my own version of The Devil Went Down to Georgia.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.200
But about Alex and Ali Alexander.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.680
Do you have accompaniment?

13:24.680 --> 13:25.760
No, no.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.560
I want to get a piano.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.240
Certainly not.

13:28.240 --> 13:28.920
Oh, damn it.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.400
I might want to do some mouth sounds.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.240
OK, all right. I'll take that.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.600
Alex went down to Georgia.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.440
He was looking to stop the steal.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.360
His sales were down.

13:36.360 --> 13:39.400
His staff's a clown and the situation is an ordeal.

13:39.400 --> 13:43.680
When he came across this young man spinning a yarn and spinning it hot.

13:43.680 --> 13:47.440
And Alex jumped up on top of his tank and said, boy, let me tell you what.

13:47.440 --> 13:50.320
I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a bullshit artist, too.

13:50.320 --> 13:53.080
And if you care to dare, I'd like to work with you.

13:53.080 --> 13:56.800
Now you spin a mighty fine yarn, boy, but give the Texan his due.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.400
I need your skills to sell my pills, but I'm still better than you.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.600
The boy said, my name's Ali and it might be unwise,

14:03.600 --> 14:08.000
but I'll join your scam to make some clams because I only have shameful allies.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.640
Meter was a little off.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.040
You know what?

14:10.040 --> 14:11.280
I'm going to give that one to you.

14:11.280 --> 14:11.560
Thank you.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.440
Perfect so far.

14:12.440 --> 14:13.440
Just keep on rolling.

14:13.440 --> 14:16.760
Ali rising up your theories and push your talking points hard

14:16.760 --> 14:20.320
because there's profit to make in Georgia and Alex is a blowhard.

14:20.320 --> 14:23.560
If this works the money and re-noun are all yours,

14:23.560 --> 14:26.880
but if you don't you'll end up working for wars!

14:33.680 --> 14:38.520
Alex mumbled about his obsession with the unborn and flyer.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.800
I might have taken that one from the top.

14:43.800 --> 14:50.960
I'm going to be honest with you, you just don't get this from other political podcasts.

14:50.960 --> 14:51.960
You just don't.

14:51.960 --> 14:56.520
Alex mumbled about his obsession with the unborn and fire flew from his fingertips when

14:56.520 --> 15:01.240
he gripped his tiny bullhorn and he pushed the talk button and there was a static hiss.

15:01.240 --> 15:08.020
He'd forgotten to replace the batteries so it sounded something like this.

15:08.020 --> 15:11.600
As Alex fumbled, Ali said, your tech problems are sad, old son.

15:11.600 --> 15:15.440
I know you have a million dollar studio, but let me show you how it's done.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.440
Fraud in the votes.

15:16.440 --> 15:17.440
Run boys, run.

15:17.440 --> 15:22.240
All you have to do is say dominion.

15:22.240 --> 15:25.760
Pretend QAnon shit is solid info.

15:25.760 --> 15:26.760
Is Roger Stone pulling my strings?

15:26.760 --> 15:27.760
No child, no.

15:27.760 --> 15:34.800
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,

15:34.800 --> 15:41.360
Alex got a miss- I didn't think there was any way there was

15:41.360 --> 15:42.360
another verse.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.360
There's a, there's a conclusion.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.360
Sir, you are going for it.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.600
There's a conclusion.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.600
Your commitment to this is fucking fantastic.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.600
There's a story being told here.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.000
No, I, I'm with you.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.720
Alex got a misty look in his eye because he knew he'd met a friend and he offered Ali

15:53.720 --> 15:56.800
his tiny bullhorn, handing it by the speaker end.

15:56.800 --> 16:00.260
Ali said, can you call Larry Nichols about that congressional blackmail?

16:00.260 --> 16:05.160
And I done told you once, you son of a bitch, stop extending the Easter sale.

16:05.160 --> 16:12.920
So, that's, someone put that to music.

16:12.920 --> 16:19.000
Before the show, you were telling me, you know what, it's been real hard to do any kind

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
of thinky work.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
You've been struggling.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Why'd you do that?

16:22.000 --> 16:23.280
Now I realize that it's just been the song.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.280
It's just been the song.

16:24.280 --> 16:27.320
That took me maybe half an hour.

16:27.320 --> 16:32.200
Uh, yeah, so someone put that to music.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.200
Alex went down to Georgia.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.080
Looking to stop the steal.

16:36.080 --> 16:39.120
DJ Danerkey is going to turn that into an absolute banger.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.800
We're going to get what number one on the billboard charts.

16:41.800 --> 16:47.080
So, uh, the Democrats, they're trying to steal that election in Georgia.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.080
Why?

16:48.080 --> 16:49.080
They already won it though.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.080
Well, they're going to steal it.

16:50.080 --> 16:54.400
And they better be, you know, Thursday apparently is the deadline.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.400
We're recording this on Thursday.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.400
Oh shit.

16:56.400 --> 16:59.520
I have been on the phone with people in the Trump campaign.

16:59.520 --> 17:06.240
I've been on the phone with a lot of different top political strategists and for all intents

17:06.240 --> 17:12.760
and purposes, this election could be over for president Trump Thursday, last Thursday,

17:12.760 --> 17:13.760
hold on.

17:13.760 --> 17:19.440
He'll still not leave office because the fraud is real, but it will give them perception

17:19.440 --> 17:25.400
that the election has been certified and it'll make the road towards the lighthouse for the

17:25.400 --> 17:26.640
second Trump term.

17:26.640 --> 17:30.360
And I was taking our country back very, very hard.

17:30.360 --> 17:33.880
Yeah, no shit that will, that will make things more challenging.

17:33.880 --> 17:34.880
Yeah.

17:34.880 --> 17:35.880
Yeah.

17:35.880 --> 17:36.880
Yes.

17:36.880 --> 17:41.200
The process continuing to move along as it's supposed to will make derailing the process

17:41.200 --> 17:42.200
more difficult.

17:42.200 --> 17:46.720
My car being turned into a cube will make it difficult to drive from here on out.

17:46.720 --> 17:47.720
Yeah, that's true.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.120
That is, that is true.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.120
Having your wheels taken.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.120
Yeah.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.120
Yeah.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.120
It's a hindrance.

17:53.120 --> 17:54.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

17:54.480 --> 17:59.760
Having my feet cut off will really make it harder to play football.

17:59.760 --> 18:00.760
Yes.

18:00.760 --> 18:01.760
Yeah.

18:01.760 --> 18:04.040
So Alex is not the only one who's heading down to Georgia.

18:04.040 --> 18:07.080
Of course, Ali Alexander is, is going down there.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.080
Sure.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.080
Some other noted weirdos.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.080
Right.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.520
But Alex thinks that everybody needs to go to Georgia.

18:12.520 --> 18:13.520
Sure.

18:13.520 --> 18:18.120
And I would like to just point out again, I don't, I don't want to keep beating a dead

18:18.120 --> 18:20.280
horse and I love that caravan.

18:20.280 --> 18:22.200
The caravan went to Georgia.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.200
Yes, it did.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.520
And it was, and it was wildly successful.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.520
You already did.

18:26.520 --> 18:27.520
No, no, no.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.080
It was wildly successful.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.680
And so they need to do it again.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.680
Sure.

18:31.680 --> 18:32.680
Okay.

18:32.680 --> 18:37.200
You better start getting on the plane or in the car and heading to the capital of Georgia.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.200
Can't remember what it is.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.560
That is all unfolding right now.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.520
Too many black people live there.

18:42.520 --> 18:46.820
Because we can force the legislature to force the governor to order an emergency session

18:46.820 --> 18:48.000
and not certify it.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.920
The legislature must stand up now with the governor who works for the Clintons, not just

18:52.920 --> 18:55.320
his chief of staff is the problem.

18:55.320 --> 18:56.320
That's coming up next segment.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.080
I got to refuel though here.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.080
We need funding.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.080
Yeah, no shit.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.080
Of course.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.080
Yeah.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.080
I don't know.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.080
I find this unconvincing, uninteresting.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.080
Yeah.

19:06.080 --> 19:13.000
I'm a little bit blown away by the, the level to which they're willing to embarrass themselves

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
without actually.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Are you talking about Rudy?

19:15.000 --> 19:18.160
I'm talking about the whole, the whole, the whole kitten caboose.

19:18.160 --> 19:22.760
They're all teaming up to make everything a sick joke.

19:22.760 --> 19:27.340
And it's weird me out because that suggests to me that we're going to have to escalate

19:27.340 --> 19:32.400
from sick joke to full on military takeover or, or they're just going to, I don't know.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.040
You know, he's not just going to go.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.040
You notice how I escalated.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.040
I wrote a parody.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.040
Yeah, exactly.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.720
He's not just going to go.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.240
It's not just going to go.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.880
So here we go.

19:42.880 --> 19:43.880
Let's ride this.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.800
I don't know why everyone's acting like we can just wait and he'll just go.

19:46.800 --> 19:51.060
Well, I think that's one of the good re like the reasons why I'm really glad that our show

19:51.060 --> 19:52.400
is about Alex Jones.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.400
Yeah.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.960
Because at least I know he's full of shit.

19:54.960 --> 20:00.000
I don't know what's going on in terms of other places and that's very scary to me.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.640
So I'd rather not have, uh, you know, an opinion that people take too seriously on it because

20:05.640 --> 20:06.640
I could be wrong.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.640
Right.

20:07.640 --> 20:13.840
I could misinterpret something with Alex totally fine saying he is full of shit, full of shit,

20:13.840 --> 20:17.000
trying to get attention and push extremist views.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
We can handle that.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Yeah.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.140
And then along the way, sometimes there's something really fun.

20:21.140 --> 20:25.520
Like look, Hey, it's always fun to write a parody song of the devil went down in Georgia.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.520
True.

20:26.520 --> 20:27.520
It's been done a lot.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.520
A lot.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.520
Cause it's great.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.520
Yeah.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.760
Another thing that's fun is when Alex says things like this.

20:31.760 --> 20:36.540
Imagine a doctor who episode where the Daleks are always little robots rolling around like

20:36.540 --> 20:38.540
R2D2 saying, exterminate, exterminate.

20:38.540 --> 20:42.840
But it said, they said, hello, my friend, I'm here to test you for the COVID.

20:42.840 --> 20:43.840
Oh, sorry.

20:43.840 --> 20:44.840
You've got it.

20:44.840 --> 20:45.840
You've got to go away.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.080
That would be a very different villain.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.680
And now they actually in Japan and Europe have Daleks.

20:49.680 --> 20:53.560
They look just like Daleks, right out of Dr. Who, whoever signed it copied a Dalek.

20:53.560 --> 20:54.560
Sure.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.000
And they come up and stick a swab up your nose.

20:57.000 --> 21:07.760
And if you don't, an inner hatch opens up and a gun comes up.

21:07.760 --> 21:10.000
I want one of those.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.080
I want one of those right now.

21:12.080 --> 21:22.360
I want a swab to gun transfer out of one barrel.

21:22.360 --> 21:23.680
I love that so much.

21:23.680 --> 21:24.680
All right.

21:24.680 --> 21:30.160
So there's this robot that's going around and it's programmed, I guess, because he's

21:30.160 --> 21:32.800
not saying that someone's captaining this robot.

21:32.800 --> 21:38.160
I assume the robot comes up to you and it's supposed to swab you and somehow it's in its

21:38.160 --> 21:42.320
programming that if you refuse, it shakes you down with a gun.

21:42.320 --> 21:46.760
It threatens you with a gun, presumably not shooting you if you then agree to get the

21:46.760 --> 21:47.760
swab.

21:47.760 --> 21:48.760
No, of course not.

21:48.760 --> 21:51.440
It's traditional carrot and stick.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.440
All right.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.600
Here's your swab or here's your gun.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.400
Turns out you're going to choose the swab in the end.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.400
Carrot, carrot, stick, swab, gun.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.400
It's all the same.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.520
It's all the same thing.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.520
I think...

22:01.520 --> 22:02.760
Why would you even need...

22:02.760 --> 22:04.440
I would prefer a knife.

22:04.440 --> 22:09.220
If it just switched from a swab to a knife and it's like, one of these is going up your

22:09.220 --> 22:10.220
nose today, you choose.

22:10.220 --> 22:16.080
These machines would be made by doctors who I assume would not prioritize gun.

22:16.080 --> 22:23.320
All right, the head of the Mayo Clinic is a real gun nut.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.320
Yeah.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.320
All right.

22:25.320 --> 22:30.320
So we're developing this robot that's specifically to test people for COVID to make it so people

22:30.320 --> 22:33.320
don't have to risk getting exposed to run tests.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.120
I feel like you didn't answer my only question.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.120
Of course it has gone.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.120
See?

22:38.120 --> 22:39.120
Now we're in business.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.120
I will green light anything.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.120
This is amazing.

22:42.120 --> 22:43.120
It's in the news.

22:43.120 --> 22:46.120
I'm going to need a citation on this.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.120
I'm going to need a source.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.120
If anybody...

22:48.120 --> 22:51.440
I looked it up, I could not find information on this.

22:51.440 --> 22:55.600
Although I think what he's referring to is that there are robots that are used for COVID

22:55.600 --> 22:56.600
testing.

22:56.600 --> 22:57.600
Sure.

22:57.600 --> 22:58.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.320
In a number of countries, they've rolled out some models of these and I think he's combining

23:01.320 --> 23:07.460
that with, there was a crowd control robot in China from maybe last year that they were

23:07.460 --> 23:11.920
working on that would give little shocks to people to try and corral them in different

23:11.920 --> 23:12.920
directions.

23:12.920 --> 23:13.920
An R2D2 shock, yeah.

23:13.920 --> 23:18.880
Yeah, I think he's mixing up those two things, but the mental image is so funny.

23:18.880 --> 23:21.960
So if I take this swab, no, I will not.

23:21.960 --> 23:22.960
What about now?

23:22.960 --> 23:25.760
Now here's the thing that tickles me the most.

23:25.760 --> 23:26.760
This is what tickles me the most.

23:26.760 --> 23:27.760
The inside hatch.

23:27.760 --> 23:28.760
The gun comes out.

23:28.760 --> 23:29.760
That's what it is.

23:29.760 --> 23:30.760
That's what it is.

23:30.760 --> 23:31.760
It's so great.

23:31.760 --> 23:32.760
Yes.

23:32.760 --> 23:33.760
That's what it's so great.

23:33.760 --> 23:34.760
It's a perfect image.

23:34.760 --> 23:35.760
It's so fucking funny.

23:35.760 --> 23:36.760
It's the hatch.

23:36.760 --> 23:37.760
Yeah.

23:37.760 --> 23:40.760
Does it, does it shoot out with a cartoon, like spring, like boing.

23:40.760 --> 23:41.760
Yeah, of course.

23:41.760 --> 23:42.760
It's got a robot hand.

23:42.760 --> 23:43.760
Yeah, exactly.

23:43.760 --> 23:47.360
Stick them up.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.760
And then it takes your wallet.

23:49.760 --> 23:53.440
Oh boy, yeah.

23:53.440 --> 23:56.880
Alright, I'm here for a showdown.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.680
So this has been the fun part of the show.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.800
Meet me at high noon.

24:00.800 --> 24:05.360
So now Alex gets into like what, uh, you know, his sort of Georgia story line.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.360
Okay.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.360
And this is the big story.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.360
Lawsuit.

24:08.360 --> 24:16.920
Georgia Secretary of State signed a legal deal with Democrats challenging how ballots

24:16.920 --> 24:17.920
are processed.

24:17.920 --> 24:23.800
A law is going to be processed after and allowing mail-in ballots to be counted without actual

24:23.800 --> 24:27.960
proof or signatures being confirmed and it just goes on from there.

24:27.960 --> 24:31.900
This is another classic case of Alex getting a Trump talking point that's factually incorrect

24:31.900 --> 24:36.440
and then it's spiraling out of control when he's recovering it into something else altogether.

24:36.440 --> 24:40.000
In this case, Trump tweeted about how the, how Georgia was stealing the election and

24:40.000 --> 24:44.260
that there had been a consent decree by the Secretary of State that quote, makes it impossible

24:44.260 --> 24:47.840
to check and match signatures on ballots and envelopes, et cetera.

24:47.840 --> 24:52.360
Trump went on to say, quote, they know, uh, they're, they knew they were going to cheat,

24:52.360 --> 24:54.740
must expose real signatures.

24:54.740 --> 24:59.000
This dude's tweeting like a detective in a shitty noir film who's just been shot, scrawling

24:59.000 --> 25:02.040
on a piece of paper, must expose real signatures.

25:02.040 --> 25:06.560
Anyway, I have no idea how a consent decree would make it impossible for people to compare

25:06.560 --> 25:09.900
signatures, but I guess that's the best Trump's people can come up with to keep people like

25:09.900 --> 25:14.040
Alex busy and keep people funneling money into that stopping of steals.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.040
Sure, sure.

25:15.040 --> 25:19.240
In reality, according to the Associated Press, the state absolutely requires signatures to

25:19.240 --> 25:20.240
match.

25:20.240 --> 25:24.280
The issue comes down to this quote, a lawsuit by the Democratic Party, which led to the

25:24.280 --> 25:29.540
agreement, argued that minorities were disproportionately affected when they had their ballots rejected.

25:29.540 --> 25:34.560
Among other things, the settlement set steps for local election officials to notify a voter

25:34.560 --> 25:40.160
by phone, mail, or email in a timely fashion about problems with a signature.

25:40.160 --> 25:49.400
Are they really trying to tell me that a state governed by Kemp has not done enough voter

25:49.400 --> 25:50.400
suppression?

25:50.400 --> 25:51.400
It's an interesting angle.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.400
Right?

25:52.400 --> 25:53.400
Yeah.

25:53.400 --> 25:58.000
It's like he didn't win the election because it was free and fair, Dan.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.640
Some have said that.

25:59.640 --> 26:03.240
Like maybe if there were paper ballots, we might find out that the results might have

26:03.240 --> 26:04.640
been different.

26:04.640 --> 26:05.640
It could be.

26:05.640 --> 26:06.640
Yeah.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.080
And this is just another legal challenge that Trump's camp is making, trying to block the

26:09.080 --> 26:13.100
finalization of the election, but it's going to get thrown out just like all the others.

26:13.100 --> 26:16.840
The only thing I find really interesting here is the dynamic where Alex can't even really

26:16.840 --> 26:19.080
understand what the issue is.

26:19.080 --> 26:22.560
Alex thinks that it has to do with deadlines and votes without signatures, but that's not

26:22.560 --> 26:23.560
the case.

26:23.560 --> 26:26.800
The legal challenge has to do with whether or not the Secretary of State had the authority

26:26.800 --> 26:31.360
to make the changes that were made, which were designed to create more oversight and

26:31.360 --> 26:33.820
better handling of signature matching.

26:33.820 --> 26:37.960
The suit doesn't seem to even take issue with the actual change that was made, just that

26:37.960 --> 26:42.120
it was allegedly made unilaterally and without proper approval, which is pretty deep in the

26:42.120 --> 26:45.360
weeds in terms of legal challenges to an election.

26:45.360 --> 26:48.080
I'm not surprised Alex doesn't know the details on this.

26:48.080 --> 26:52.540
I wouldn't expect him to, since being aware of how much of a Hail Mary this is would probably

26:52.540 --> 26:54.040
be bad for business.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.920
Can you imagine if that's what did it?

26:55.920 --> 26:59.760
I believe that right before we started recording, this challenge got thrown out.

26:59.760 --> 27:00.760
Yeah, of course.

27:00.760 --> 27:05.960
I believe, if I understand the headline I just saw correctly, I believe this case has

27:05.960 --> 27:06.960
just died.

27:06.960 --> 27:10.680
It got thrown out the moment the judge realized that it was written in colored pencil.

27:10.680 --> 27:11.680
Wow.

27:11.680 --> 27:16.960
So, can you imagine if that's what, if all of a sudden they were like, oh, the Secretary

27:16.960 --> 27:20.360
of State didn't do it right, so Trump is president again?

27:20.360 --> 27:21.360
That's not how it goes.

27:21.360 --> 27:22.360
No.

27:22.360 --> 27:23.440
That's not how it's going to work for anyone.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.080
I wouldn't assume it would.

27:25.080 --> 27:33.520
So obviously, knowing that this is weak, Alex recommends the right course of action, which

27:33.520 --> 27:35.440
is investing in gun robots.

27:35.440 --> 27:36.440
I lied.

27:36.440 --> 27:37.800
It's not.

27:37.800 --> 27:43.960
Everyone must go to the capital of Georgia now, and you must surround the governor's

27:43.960 --> 27:44.960
mansion now.

27:44.960 --> 27:45.960
I'm coming.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.600
I'll be there.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.460
And I'm bringing Roger Stone, and I'm bringing a bunch of other people.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.460
That's what I'm doing behind the scenes.

27:51.460 --> 27:55.880
And I'm calling the damn White House, and I'm telling Trump he needs to go and get on

27:55.880 --> 28:01.120
a frickin' airplane and land at the capital of Georgia and go into the governor's mansion

28:01.120 --> 28:03.640
and stop sitting there and letting his lawyers do it.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.800
We need to see people power, and this will do it.

28:05.800 --> 28:06.800
Yeah, that's a great idea.

28:06.800 --> 28:09.800
Let Trump storm the governor's mansion.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.360
I think that's a great idea.

28:11.360 --> 28:12.360
I think that's a great idea.

28:12.360 --> 28:13.480
It would look cool.

28:13.480 --> 28:17.840
I think the only thing that would be better, so that one is a great idea, and he should

28:17.840 --> 28:18.840
definitely do that.

28:18.840 --> 28:22.040
And then I think everybody in the Senate should stab him once.

28:22.040 --> 28:27.160
I do love the idea that he's like, I'm coming to Georgia, and I'm fucking bringing Roger

28:27.160 --> 28:28.640
Stone with me.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.880
Who cares?

28:29.880 --> 28:36.160
I want him to be like, and we're going to settle this election by single comment, combat.

28:36.160 --> 28:39.320
Choose your champion for we have Roger Stone in this corner.

28:39.320 --> 28:44.720
And then the camera pans over, and he's got a lampshade on his head.

28:44.720 --> 28:47.760
Complaining about Elliot Spitzer or some shit.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.800
Yeah, I'll fight whoever you fucking want.

28:49.800 --> 28:50.800
I don't give a shit.

28:50.800 --> 28:56.120
I will only fight if Elliot Spitzer's dad will come against me.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.120
Where's Bongino?

28:57.120 --> 28:58.520
Where's Bongino?

28:58.520 --> 29:01.440
So Alex has a little guest on this episode.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.840
It's not a great sign.

29:02.840 --> 29:06.200
All right, Enrique Torrio is an awesome American.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.200
Oh no, that's not good.

29:07.200 --> 29:11.980
He's the leader of the Proud Boys, and he was there helping provide security in DC for

29:11.980 --> 29:13.760
us and did an incredible job.

29:13.760 --> 29:19.880
So Enrique Torrio, guy who's the head of the Proud Boys, is on.

29:19.880 --> 29:20.880
Cool.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.040
See, this is the thing that I'm talking about.

29:23.040 --> 29:27.880
How is it that we have the juxtaposition of Rudy Giuliani melting like a fucking candle

29:27.880 --> 29:32.120
in front of us with Enrique Torrio being like, what if we killed all the leftists?

29:32.120 --> 29:34.080
Like that's, you can't have both.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.160
Here's what's interesting.

29:35.160 --> 29:42.280
Enrique Torrio is clearly trying to learn a little bit about PR, because he's doing

29:42.280 --> 29:47.400
some heavy lifting on this appearance, trying to give the, like, hey, we just like to hang

29:47.400 --> 29:48.400
out.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.800
You know, the Proud Boys, we're just like a drinking club.

29:50.800 --> 29:53.880
We just like to have a good time, and hey, we don't just let anybody in.

29:53.880 --> 30:01.000
We do extensive background checks on people like Rufio Panman, based stick man, did extensive

30:01.000 --> 30:03.400
background searches, whatever the case.

30:03.400 --> 30:08.120
He's trying to make it look much more respectable, and Alex is actually the one who's kind of

30:08.120 --> 30:09.120
ruining it.

30:09.120 --> 30:15.200
You know, when somebody, when a man's down, I don't want to keep attacking him.

30:15.200 --> 30:18.480
These are people that attack women and children, and then as soon as you let them up, they

30:18.480 --> 30:19.480
attack somebody else.

30:19.480 --> 30:20.480
Yeah, of course.

30:20.480 --> 30:24.320
Once they assault somebody, I think a good, some broken ribs will teach them.

30:24.320 --> 30:29.560
So Alex seems to be the one who's pushing this towards even more extreme, and it seems

30:29.560 --> 30:35.520
like a nerd talking to a bully, like interviewing a bully, who's like, oh, isn't it fun how

30:35.520 --> 30:36.520
you kick their asses?

30:36.520 --> 30:37.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:37.520 --> 30:41.560
It's a good thing you're not bullying me.

30:41.560 --> 30:42.800
You were kicking those guys' asses.

30:42.800 --> 30:43.800
Yeah, it's great.

30:43.800 --> 30:44.800
That's great.

30:44.800 --> 30:48.000
Well, you know, when I beat people up, I kind of, you know, once they're down, it's kind

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
of, that's the end of the fight.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.480
No, you should keep kicking them.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.480
Yeah, Jesus.

30:51.480 --> 30:52.480
Yeah, it's very strange.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.720
Alex is kind of pushing.

30:53.720 --> 30:57.960
You know, what we're trying to do is just show that we're a group of normal people like

30:57.960 --> 30:58.960
everyone else.

30:58.960 --> 31:02.480
I mean, we have our own political beliefs, but what we do is we get together and we just

31:02.480 --> 31:04.280
share community, just like we do.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.760
I think you should kill people.

31:05.760 --> 31:06.760
Yeah.

31:06.760 --> 31:07.760
Okay.

31:07.760 --> 31:13.320
Hey, Alex, we've gotten so much bad press, um, and a lot of our members turn out to be

31:13.320 --> 31:14.320
real crazy.

31:14.320 --> 31:15.320
Nazis.

31:15.320 --> 31:16.320
Well, that's one word.

31:16.320 --> 31:17.320
Well.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.760
We do a lot of background checks, but apparently not on that kind of thing.

31:19.760 --> 31:22.320
No, no, they can name a fuck ton of serials though.

31:22.320 --> 31:23.320
That's important.

31:23.320 --> 31:24.320
Exactly.

31:24.320 --> 31:25.320
Look, here's the deal.

31:25.320 --> 31:29.680
We're trying not to do all that shit publicly, all this stuff about kicking people when they're

31:29.680 --> 31:30.680
down.

31:30.680 --> 31:31.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:31.680 --> 31:32.920
We're trying to look different.

31:32.920 --> 31:33.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:33.920 --> 31:37.760
I know that the Oath Keepers and your buddy Stuart Rhodes kind of lean into that.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.760
We're going to kill you stuff.

31:38.760 --> 31:39.760
Sure.

31:39.760 --> 31:40.760
It's great.

31:40.760 --> 31:41.760
We're different.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.680
Alex, Alex, buddy, there are two ways to go.

31:44.680 --> 31:46.520
We're going underground, my friend.

31:46.520 --> 31:50.440
We're going to survive and then we'll kill people again in 10 years or four or whatever.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.000
We'll be, we'll make it through this.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.680
We're not going to go out here all Nazi guns a blazing today.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.440
And Alex is like, what if we're Nazis?

31:58.440 --> 32:04.780
I think if I had to guess, I think it's just like glass half full, half empty in terms

32:04.780 --> 32:06.360
of the DC rally.

32:06.360 --> 32:10.840
I think that Alex is trying to play it like half full, like we are going to take over

32:10.840 --> 32:11.840
the world.

32:11.840 --> 32:12.840
Sure.

32:12.840 --> 32:13.840
There was a million people there.

32:13.840 --> 32:14.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:14.840 --> 32:18.160
Whereas Enrique Torrio, it's probably like, yeah, it was a lot of people, but it wasn't

32:18.160 --> 32:19.160
that many.

32:19.160 --> 32:20.880
We can't take over the world with this many people.

32:20.880 --> 32:21.880
Not enough.

32:21.880 --> 32:22.880
Yeah.

32:22.880 --> 32:23.880
Not enough.

32:23.880 --> 32:27.600
So maybe try and put on a face of respectability.

32:27.600 --> 32:32.120
Or invite general Petraeus and see if he'll do us a solid boom.

32:32.120 --> 32:35.760
So Alex is impressed that I, I don't know if this is actually true.

32:35.760 --> 32:40.200
I think it's not, but Alex thinks that no one has ever infiltrated the proud boys.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.680
I don't think that's true.

32:42.680 --> 32:45.360
But he has a theory as to why, and I think it's pretty funny.

32:45.360 --> 32:50.680
I don't know how you guys have kept your organization pretty much infiltration free and how you

32:50.680 --> 32:54.080
guys have done such a great job in the organization.

32:54.080 --> 32:57.480
How do people get involved with proud boys and how are you keeping the organization in

32:57.480 --> 32:58.480
infiltration free?

32:58.480 --> 33:03.240
I mean, I guess you look at Antifa, they all look like devil-worshipping vampires.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.240
Can't name any serious.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.240
They're total cowards.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.240
I guess all you guys look pretty macho.

33:06.240 --> 33:09.240
Yeah, they're too macho to infiltrate, you know?

33:09.240 --> 33:13.640
Yeah, leftists are, we just can't look macho enough to infiltrate the proud of us.

33:13.640 --> 33:15.640
Too much soy or something.

33:15.640 --> 33:16.640
Yeah, that's our issue.

33:16.640 --> 33:17.640
Yeah.

33:17.640 --> 33:21.420
So I think that Alex has a pretty consistent thread going of just like really gaslighting

33:21.420 --> 33:24.860
his audience about the crowd size.

33:24.860 --> 33:29.120
He's talking about like it's straight up, maybe even a million people there.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.120
Real tough to sell.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.120
Yeah.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.120
And then something even more tough happens.

33:32.120 --> 33:36.120
Police estimated upwards of a million bigger than Louis Farrakhan's event.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.120
Incredible.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.480
We're getting Gavin McGinnis lined up, dealing with some Skype issues.

33:39.480 --> 33:40.480
Oh boy.

33:40.480 --> 33:41.980
Oh, that's a surprise.

33:41.980 --> 33:43.840
First of all, Skype issues, not a surprise.

33:43.840 --> 33:46.960
Second of all, not a surprise that now we're getting Gavin on.

33:46.960 --> 33:47.960
Oh man.

33:47.960 --> 33:51.540
We're, we're really trying to infiltrate the proud boys, I guess.

33:51.540 --> 33:55.360
I have this, I had this interesting experience while I was listening to this episode and

33:55.360 --> 34:01.580
it was largely, oh, okay, we're just going to interview a bunch of people with the proud

34:01.580 --> 34:05.140
boys and extremists and all right.

34:05.140 --> 34:06.140
I'm not interested.

34:06.140 --> 34:09.040
Hey, who else wants to start a war?

34:09.040 --> 34:10.400
You want to start a war?

34:10.400 --> 34:11.400
Yeah.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.400
Okay.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.400
Yeah.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.360
I'm not super interested except for just to say like, yeah, okay.

34:15.360 --> 34:20.880
I haven't, uh, Gavin and Enrique are talking to Alex and the whole conversation is largely

34:20.880 --> 34:22.440
about everyone's got to go to Georgia.

34:22.440 --> 34:23.440
Yeah.

34:23.440 --> 34:28.680
It's like, okay, I think this is bad, but I also don't respect Gavin at all.

34:28.680 --> 34:29.680
No.

34:29.680 --> 34:30.920
Uh, I don't, I don't, not really.

34:30.920 --> 34:31.920
He's not interesting.

34:31.920 --> 34:32.920
He's not funny.

34:32.920 --> 34:33.920
He doesn't say anything.

34:33.920 --> 34:38.160
Um, so are they trying to drum up like support from the proud boys?

34:38.160 --> 34:40.460
Like, Hey, we're focusing on the proud boys.

34:40.460 --> 34:42.400
The proud boys need to go to Atlanta.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.600
Is that like the, the idea here?

34:44.600 --> 34:49.360
No, I think they're just trying to show a stiff upper lip and sort of like, we're going

34:49.360 --> 34:54.280
to be, you can come to Atlanta because the proud boys will be there to fight with you

34:54.280 --> 34:56.640
in case shit goes bad or something.

34:56.640 --> 34:59.080
I think that that's kind of a lot of the message.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.080
Yeah.

35:00.080 --> 35:01.080
Stop being a coward.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.680
You'll have, they'll have your back.

35:02.680 --> 35:03.680
Right.

35:03.680 --> 35:08.000
Um, so Alex asks Enrique to define the moment that they're in.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.420
He keeps doing this with people, every single guest.

35:10.420 --> 35:12.560
He asks to define the moment.

35:12.560 --> 35:13.560
Okay.

35:13.560 --> 35:16.240
Uh, and then something very, very familiar happens.

35:16.240 --> 35:20.080
Enrique Tarrio has taken over proud boys, Gab McGinnis started as an idea to promote

35:20.080 --> 35:26.560
family and men and fraternity and unity for American men and American men are under attack.

35:26.560 --> 35:28.440
But now the globalists are so scared of it.

35:28.440 --> 35:29.440
You've gone through the fire.

35:29.440 --> 35:32.360
You stood up at hundreds of Antifa events for freedom.

35:32.360 --> 35:33.920
You defended so many people.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.000
What would you call Enrique Tarrio?

35:36.000 --> 35:38.440
This historic moment we're at right now.

35:38.440 --> 35:47.280
Guys want to put his mic on for him, go ahead Enrique Tarrio.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.280
Sorry, that was my fault.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.280
Oh, that's our fault.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.280
Go ahead.

35:50.280 --> 35:51.280
It's your fault.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.280
Go ahead.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.280
We don't care.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.280
We love it.

35:54.280 --> 35:55.280
Technology back and forth.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.280
Go ahead.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.280
Ooh, that happens multiple times.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.280
Guys.

35:58.280 --> 35:59.280
I think there's some mic muting issues.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.280
Uh, I'm not entirely sure.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.280
Oh boy.

36:01.280 --> 36:04.520
Anyway, uh, Gavin shows up and we're not going to listen to too much of him because I find

36:04.520 --> 36:05.920
him, uh, unsufferable.

36:05.920 --> 36:06.920
Odious?

36:06.920 --> 36:07.920
Yes, that too.

36:07.920 --> 36:13.280
Uh, but, uh, I just wanted to say that I'm thrilled that he's decided to give up.

36:13.280 --> 36:18.320
We proved it this weekend that we are on the side of what's right and they are on the side

36:18.320 --> 36:19.320
of what's wrong.

36:19.320 --> 36:22.120
And if you can't see that now, I give up.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.120
Congratulations.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.120
Good, good, good.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.200
Please, please give up.

36:26.200 --> 36:32.080
Didn't Gavin come on Alex's show like a year ago saying, fuck this, we're done, give up.

36:32.080 --> 36:33.080
What's the point?

36:33.080 --> 36:34.080
Yep.

36:34.080 --> 36:40.960
Nothing, nothing expresses, uh, you know, just like leader more than any time you lose

36:40.960 --> 36:43.640
moody deciding to quit moody lash outs.

36:43.640 --> 36:44.640
Yeah.

36:44.640 --> 36:45.640
Yeah.

36:45.640 --> 36:46.640
That's how I want to, I admire it.

36:46.640 --> 36:47.640
Yeah, absolutely.

36:47.640 --> 36:48.640
I do not.

36:48.640 --> 36:52.920
I, a lot of people would listen to that and say, I would die for that man.

36:52.920 --> 36:53.920
Anyway.

36:53.920 --> 36:54.920
Fuck, uh, fuck Gavin.

36:54.920 --> 37:02.000
Uh, Owen, Owen Troyer, leader of the caravan comes in and they talk about their huge crowds.

37:02.000 --> 37:08.480
Owen, you did the caravan through the South up to DC.

37:08.480 --> 37:11.680
The police that we talked to estimated, cause I was saying 200,000 that day, cause the police

37:11.680 --> 37:12.680
were saying 200,001 spot.

37:12.680 --> 37:14.560
Turns out that was three and a half miles.

37:14.560 --> 37:16.560
People going back to the beginning of it.

37:16.560 --> 37:17.560
Three and a half miles.

37:17.560 --> 37:22.200
They're estimating 800 to 800,000, a million people, and then Antifa attacking at night,

37:22.200 --> 37:24.240
getting their asses kicked, all of it.

37:24.240 --> 37:28.320
What would you describe this moment in history as well?

37:28.320 --> 37:30.560
From the images I've seen sad.

37:30.560 --> 37:36.800
I think that this had more people in attendance than the million man March.

37:36.800 --> 37:41.240
From the images I've seen sure of your caravan.

37:41.240 --> 37:44.560
I've done standup for larger crowds.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.160
And I was a failure.

37:46.160 --> 37:47.160
Yeah.

37:47.160 --> 37:48.160
Oh yeah.

37:48.160 --> 37:49.160
Yep.

37:49.160 --> 37:50.160
Yep.

37:50.160 --> 37:51.160
Uh, I don't know.

37:51.160 --> 37:52.160
Oh boy.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.780
I don't care about relative size to the million man March either.

37:54.780 --> 37:56.000
They seem really hung up on that.

37:56.000 --> 38:00.040
They really want to make sure that this March is better than other black people's Marches.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.960
It seems like a- It's bigger than Louis Farrakhan's March.

38:02.960 --> 38:03.960
Why did you choose that one?

38:03.960 --> 38:05.240
It seems like a sticking point.

38:05.240 --> 38:06.520
They brought it up a couple times.

38:06.520 --> 38:12.080
Yeah, it seems very important to them that- I would ask you, Jordan, how do you define

38:12.080 --> 38:13.080
the times?

38:13.080 --> 38:14.080
How do I define the times?

38:14.080 --> 38:17.080
How do you define this moment that we're in?

38:17.080 --> 38:19.360
I would say pathetic.

38:19.360 --> 38:20.360
It is sad.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.040
I would say pathetic.

38:22.040 --> 38:29.000
I would say that the human race has responded brilliantly and terribly.

38:29.000 --> 38:35.920
At the same time, to the point where, man, I'm really hoping we lose 98% of people and

38:35.920 --> 38:36.920
get the reefs back.

38:36.920 --> 38:37.920
Do you know what I'm saying?

38:37.920 --> 38:39.900
The 98% of reefs lost?

38:39.900 --> 38:42.640
That's a tragedy.

38:42.640 --> 38:43.960
That's not great.

38:43.960 --> 38:47.120
So Owen has had a revelation lately.

38:47.120 --> 38:48.120
Sure.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.380
This doesn't seem like a revelation.

38:50.380 --> 38:55.760
Seems like very similar to catchphrase of Ben Shapiro's kind of.

38:55.760 --> 38:56.760
Great.

38:56.760 --> 39:00.400
I would say that party politic is emotion over evidence.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.580
It's emotion over evidence.

39:01.580 --> 39:03.400
Same thing with the mainstream news, emotion over evidence.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.680
We live in reality.

39:04.680 --> 39:05.680
We live in reality.

39:05.680 --> 39:06.720
A million people out there.

39:06.720 --> 39:07.720
Nobody got COVID.

39:07.720 --> 39:08.720
Nobody got sick.

39:08.720 --> 39:09.720
I'm riding back in the airplane.

39:09.720 --> 39:10.720
Everyone's fine.

39:10.720 --> 39:11.720
Laughing about the dumb mask thing.

39:11.720 --> 39:16.880
They almost kicked me off a plane floor, but we won't go into that.

39:16.880 --> 39:21.040
It's far too soon to know what kind of effect that DC rally is going to have on COVID rates,

39:21.040 --> 39:25.200
but it's not too soon to discuss broader trends that we've seen from past events.

39:25.200 --> 39:29.440
If Trump's rallies throughout 2020 are any indication, Owen may have to eat those words

39:29.440 --> 39:31.760
in the future once data is available.

39:31.760 --> 39:36.280
A report released in October by the Center for American Progress said, quote, analysis

39:36.280 --> 39:40.480
by the Center for American Progress finds that about half of the president's 22 campaign

39:40.480 --> 39:45.920
rallies held between June and September were followed by county level increase in COVID-19

39:45.920 --> 39:49.600
cases suggesting the events may have led to community spread.

39:49.600 --> 39:54.560
I don't have data on the recent rally, nor does anyone yet, but I mostly cut out that

39:54.560 --> 39:59.480
clip because I have a hunch that Owen's going to look pretty bad in hindsight as will this.

39:59.480 --> 40:04.000
It's like crazy from, from like five blocks up to the Supreme Court, you're, you're packed

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
in like sardines.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.600
I mean, there's, you can barely even breathe.

40:08.600 --> 40:12.160
Poor choice of words, I would say there.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.200
Oh Jesus.

40:14.200 --> 40:21.640
So we end the 16th and we jump into the 17th and this is, this was really strange at the

40:21.640 --> 40:22.640
beginning.

40:22.640 --> 40:27.440
First of all, Alex screws up his, his whole thing, this whole time period between the

40:27.440 --> 40:29.040
election and the inauguration.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.640
What do you, what is it?

40:30.640 --> 40:32.200
79 days of hell.

40:32.200 --> 40:33.200
Yeah.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.200
79 days of hell.

40:34.200 --> 40:35.200
Yeah.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.200
It's a countdown.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.880
Day after the election, 78 days of hell left.

40:38.880 --> 40:39.880
Yeah.

40:39.880 --> 40:40.880
Alex screws it up.

40:40.880 --> 40:41.880
Goes backwards on it.

40:41.880 --> 40:47.400
It is now day 64 of the 79 days of hell.

40:47.400 --> 40:52.400
Communist China and its new allies are desperately trying to overthrow the election of President

40:52.400 --> 40:53.400
Trump.

40:53.400 --> 40:57.360
I understand that it's an easy mistake to make, but no one cares about this except you.

40:57.360 --> 40:59.200
This is not caught on.

40:59.200 --> 41:00.200
It's not great.

41:00.200 --> 41:05.240
It's not, no one's going to remember 10 years from now, oh, you remember the 79 days of

41:05.240 --> 41:06.240
hell.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.920
You're the one who's pushing this really hard.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.820
You have to actually get it right.

41:09.820 --> 41:12.160
You can't say we're on day 64 now.

41:12.160 --> 41:14.480
There is only 15 days of hell left.

41:14.480 --> 41:16.720
There's a little bit of a, yeah.

41:16.720 --> 41:19.120
Oh, is hell going to end on the 30th?

41:19.120 --> 41:24.040
He's trying to count down, but he messed up.

41:24.040 --> 41:25.040
And that's fine.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.040
It is fine.

41:26.040 --> 41:27.040
But it's not.

41:27.040 --> 41:28.040
No, of course not.

41:28.040 --> 41:29.040
This is his baby.

41:29.040 --> 41:30.040
Anyway.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.040
Yeah.

41:31.040 --> 41:34.720
There was a weird sound and I don't mean like poor quality sound or anything like I really

41:34.720 --> 41:39.200
felt like Alex is, it sounded like he was reading a commercial at the beginning of this

41:39.200 --> 41:40.360
episode.

41:40.360 --> 41:44.480
And now the mainline Republican party has awoken to the truth of the new world order

41:44.480 --> 41:51.760
and world government and Tucker Carlson is a fancier, more well-produced version of Infowars.

41:51.760 --> 41:57.440
Not because Tucker Carlson's copying yours truly, but because the world has awoken.

41:57.440 --> 42:02.280
Yes, the enemy's striking back hard, but my friends, when it comes to the culture war,

42:02.280 --> 42:07.160
when it comes to recognizing the UN and its true aim of world government depopulation,

42:07.160 --> 42:08.840
we are winning.

42:08.840 --> 42:11.440
So didn't that, I mean, that seems, that sounds like a promo.

42:11.440 --> 42:12.960
Yeah, that was a movie trailer.

42:12.960 --> 42:13.960
Yeah.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.800
That was pre, that was LaFontaine all the way.

42:16.800 --> 42:17.800
Yeah.

42:17.800 --> 42:21.040
And I was really thrown by it because it just seemed like, what is going on?

42:21.040 --> 42:26.520
And then he goes to a couple of like prerecorded reports and I realized he just wasn't there.

42:26.520 --> 42:27.520
That was prerecorded.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.520
Oh, that was, okay.

42:28.520 --> 42:29.520
Yeah.

42:29.520 --> 42:31.080
Alex shows up 14 minutes into the episode.

42:31.080 --> 42:34.320
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.

42:34.320 --> 42:36.120
I've got plenty of important stuff to cover.

42:36.120 --> 42:40.520
I don't normally start the broadcast with five minutes or six minutes of Tucker Carlson,

42:40.520 --> 42:42.480
but he knocked it out of the park.

42:42.480 --> 42:47.280
So yeah, Alex shows up late, I guess he was getting more information about Georgia or

42:47.280 --> 42:48.280
something.

42:48.280 --> 42:49.280
Sure.

42:49.280 --> 42:54.480
There's an interesting dynamic that's going on and I think that though Alex is crazy and

42:54.480 --> 42:59.080
all this stuff is nonsense, I think he's benefiting from QAnon quite a bit.

42:59.080 --> 43:00.080
Yeah.

43:00.080 --> 43:05.680
Cause you know, you remember the dynamic that existed, you know, in previous times between

43:05.680 --> 43:09.280
people like Fox News and Glenn Beck and Alex Jones.

43:09.280 --> 43:14.240
Alex Jones justified Glenn Beck being crazy because he's like, I'm not Alex Jones.

43:14.240 --> 43:15.240
Exactly.

43:15.240 --> 43:20.400
He was able to sanitize himself and make himself seem more palatable to a wider audience.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.000
Yeah, he was a bullshit launderer.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Yeah.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.320
And because there was someone who could be like, I'm not that guy.

43:25.320 --> 43:29.520
I'm stepping on that guy in order to make myself look respectable.

43:29.520 --> 43:32.840
I think Alex now has QAnon to be like, I'm not QAnon.

43:32.840 --> 43:34.840
That's fair.

43:34.840 --> 43:36.000
That's a fair point.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.840
And because everything has just gotten so much worse in terms of public discourse and

43:40.840 --> 43:46.540
people filtering information, like I think, I think he's able to like take advantage of

43:46.540 --> 43:52.520
people thinking that like there's only one person who's wrong at any time or whatever.

43:52.520 --> 43:54.480
Not realizing QAnon and Alex can be wrong.

43:54.480 --> 43:56.360
Glenn Beck and Alex are both wrong.

43:56.360 --> 44:02.040
You think, uh, you think QAnon stuff is going to, uh, become leaderless and they're going

44:02.040 --> 44:05.280
to be like, eh, maybe we'll go back to Alex Jones.

44:05.280 --> 44:06.280
No, I don't.

44:06.280 --> 44:07.280
Well, I don't know.

44:07.280 --> 44:10.360
I don't know what to predict of it, but I think that most of those people are too

44:10.360 --> 44:12.000
pilled to go back to Alex.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.800
Too far gone to go back to the light stuff.

44:14.800 --> 44:15.800
Yeah.

44:15.800 --> 44:18.720
I think they would find it a little bit disappointing.

44:18.720 --> 44:19.720
Sure.

44:19.720 --> 44:20.720
They would find it ungratifying.

44:20.720 --> 44:21.720
Yeah.

44:21.720 --> 44:27.300
So even though Alex is late, starting the show 14 minutes in or whatever, he did say

44:27.300 --> 44:29.200
that he has some important stuff to talk about.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.200
Of course.

44:30.200 --> 44:34.200
Now generally when he has important things to talk about, it's bizarre fantasies.

44:34.200 --> 44:35.200
Right.

44:35.200 --> 44:36.200
Notions.

44:36.200 --> 44:37.240
Of course.

44:37.240 --> 44:38.840
Things he's misremembering.

44:38.840 --> 44:39.840
Half baked anything.

44:39.840 --> 44:40.840
True.

44:40.840 --> 44:41.840
Yeah.

44:41.840 --> 44:46.240
And my, one of my favorite things is reporting Twitter comments as if they're news.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.240
That's good.

44:47.240 --> 44:53.340
Another comment on Twitter said half the PM and the future head of the state of our country

44:53.340 --> 44:57.500
have been openly promoting the globalist world economic forum, great recent initiative for

44:57.500 --> 45:02.940
months already, but I cannot find a single mainstream media article in Canada that has

45:02.940 --> 45:05.540
mentioned or discussed it because you're a slave.

45:05.540 --> 45:09.080
You're not supposed to see all that info.

45:09.080 --> 45:15.240
You're supposed to be preconditioned to the UN world government takeover slogans before

45:15.240 --> 45:18.160
you ever consciously understand what it is.

45:18.160 --> 45:21.340
So this is really standard bullshit, but I think it highlights something that's really

45:21.340 --> 45:24.200
interesting within like Alex and his rhetoric.

45:24.200 --> 45:25.200
Sure.

45:25.200 --> 45:29.140
You can easily find articles discussing the ideas presented by Klaus Schwab in references

45:29.140 --> 45:34.040
by name to quote the great reset in media going back to early this year after his book

45:34.040 --> 45:35.240
was published.

45:35.240 --> 45:39.660
Just a simple Google search shows that before July, there were articles in Vanity Fair,

45:39.660 --> 45:44.940
the Hill, the Financial Times, Forbes, and plenty of international outlets.

45:44.940 --> 45:50.540
This is the same thing as why aren't there any Muslim voices denouncing terrorism.

45:50.540 --> 45:51.620
You didn't look for it.

45:51.620 --> 45:53.260
You assume it's not there.

45:53.260 --> 45:57.520
And now you're making out a conspiracy out of the idea that you haven't found anything.

45:57.520 --> 45:59.580
There are plenty of people talking about these ideas.

45:59.580 --> 46:02.060
They were just not places you were interested in.

46:02.060 --> 46:05.420
They weren't in publications that you maybe normally read.

46:05.420 --> 46:06.900
The Hill is publicly available.

46:06.900 --> 46:07.900
It's there.

46:07.900 --> 46:08.980
These articles are there.

46:08.980 --> 46:13.860
If you wanted to, if you had any interest, that discussion's there.

46:13.860 --> 46:15.720
No one's hiding anything from you.

46:15.720 --> 46:18.940
You can type questions into the Google search bar.

46:18.940 --> 46:19.940
True.

46:19.940 --> 46:23.560
So if he's like giving you one of those rhetorical questions, like how come no one's talking

46:23.560 --> 46:28.600
about this, you could type in like how come no one's talking about this and you would

46:28.600 --> 46:29.600
have to fill in.

46:29.600 --> 46:30.600
Right.

46:30.600 --> 46:36.140
I think that what's going on is a mis-phrasing of what they believe or what they experience

46:36.140 --> 46:37.140
as the problem.

46:37.140 --> 46:38.140
Sure.

46:38.140 --> 46:42.900
They want these ideas to be yelled on the front page of every paper.

46:42.900 --> 46:46.440
That is what they think they merit.

46:46.440 --> 46:47.440
It's so important.

46:47.440 --> 46:48.440
Exactly.

46:48.440 --> 46:51.820
In the same way that all of Alex's conspiracies whenever it's like the media's not covering

46:51.820 --> 46:55.660
X, Y, or Z, like there's an article about why you're wrong about this everywhere.

46:55.660 --> 46:57.020
You can find it if you want.

46:57.020 --> 46:59.980
They just want this, like the coverage.

46:59.980 --> 47:05.100
The same thing with like no one covers like Trump being good and you can find articles

47:05.100 --> 47:07.660
and publications about good things Trump's done.

47:07.660 --> 47:11.700
It's just that no one is bowing down and being like, oh Trump, you're the king.

47:11.700 --> 47:14.460
They're not covering it the way you want to.

47:14.460 --> 47:18.920
They're covering these ideas in a real world way as opposed to your way.

47:18.920 --> 47:24.860
And because that isn't, your view isn't being shouted from the rooftops, it's experienced

47:24.860 --> 47:25.860
as a coverup.

47:25.860 --> 47:27.580
And that's just not, that's not accurate.

47:27.580 --> 47:28.580
Yeah.

47:28.580 --> 47:31.460
They're not saying what I want them to say, so they're not covering it at all.

47:31.460 --> 47:32.460
Exactly.

47:32.460 --> 47:37.300
And I'm not going to look for the articles that would prove my point wrong.

47:37.300 --> 47:38.820
And that's bad for business, Dan.

47:38.820 --> 47:42.900
Well, the thing that's really sad about it is like, I'm only talking about this phenomenon

47:42.900 --> 47:46.540
right now because Alex is reading someone's tweet.

47:46.540 --> 47:53.380
Like that's, is there any bad take you can't find on Twitter?

47:53.380 --> 47:55.540
Like you can find, like that's the situation.

47:55.540 --> 47:58.400
That's the corollary to your lies about the piano.

47:58.400 --> 47:59.400
Bees are too good.

47:59.400 --> 48:01.600
Wait, I bet you could find that.

48:01.600 --> 48:02.600
Bees are too good.

48:02.600 --> 48:03.600
Yeah.

48:03.600 --> 48:04.600
For the environment.

48:04.600 --> 48:05.600
Exactly.

48:05.600 --> 48:06.600
Shit.

48:06.600 --> 48:07.600
Exactly.

48:07.600 --> 48:08.600
Fuck.

48:08.600 --> 48:09.600
There's no oil executive somewhere who hasn't tweeted out like let's kill all the bees so

48:09.600 --> 48:11.620
I don't have to deal with flowers anymore.

48:11.620 --> 48:14.980
Trying to think of a take that isn't on there.

48:14.980 --> 48:15.980
Candy sucks.

48:15.980 --> 48:16.980
Someone doesn't like candy.

48:16.980 --> 48:17.980
Nope.

48:17.980 --> 48:18.980
Nope.

48:18.980 --> 48:19.980
Definitely there.

48:19.980 --> 48:20.980
It's all there, man.

48:20.980 --> 48:21.980
It's all there.

48:21.980 --> 48:22.980
If you want to find a bad take, you just search it into Twitter.

48:22.980 --> 48:24.240
Air tastes bad.

48:24.240 --> 48:25.240
Of course it does.

48:25.240 --> 48:27.380
Do you know where air comes from?

48:27.380 --> 48:28.380
The sky.

48:28.380 --> 48:29.380
And your butt.

48:29.380 --> 48:30.380
Exactly.

48:30.380 --> 48:31.820
Comes out of people's butts.

48:31.820 --> 48:34.060
That's the only place air comes from.

48:34.060 --> 48:36.460
So anyway, Ali Alexander shows up.

48:36.460 --> 48:38.540
And this clip is actually really interesting too.

48:38.540 --> 48:43.820
Like in the same way that last clip really demonstrated this sort of phenomenon of like

48:43.820 --> 48:48.520
not looking for evidence and then claiming there's absence of evidence of something.

48:48.520 --> 48:52.700
This is another really interesting thing that Alex and his people do quite a bit.

48:52.700 --> 48:57.780
We're really appreciative of all the grassroots work out there, but stoptheseal.us features

48:57.780 --> 49:00.940
our coalition partners and we're always willing to work with anyone.

49:00.940 --> 49:01.940
Okay.

49:01.940 --> 49:02.940
Roger.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.620
There is a phenomenon where then people go get permits.

49:04.620 --> 49:05.620
Right.

49:05.620 --> 49:07.460
And then they take over and then say it's their event.

49:07.460 --> 49:08.460
Exactly.

49:08.460 --> 49:09.900
We don't care about the event or our name.

49:09.900 --> 49:10.900
We care about winning.

49:10.900 --> 49:15.060
We care about winning in the Electoral College and getting Donald Trump above 270.

49:15.060 --> 49:17.860
You know, I happen to be a strategist, so I'm working with all of these folks.

49:17.860 --> 49:23.980
Yeah, we did have a vendor who secured the permit and then decided, oh, well, Alex can't

49:23.980 --> 49:26.460
speak and this person can't speak and that person can't speak.

49:26.460 --> 49:30.860
And then this shill should speak and this rhino should speak and then made lies about

49:30.860 --> 49:31.860
the Trump family.

49:31.860 --> 49:34.200
And, you know, that's going to come out later.

49:34.200 --> 49:36.740
But you know, we're not going to tolerate our movement being hijacked.

49:36.740 --> 49:37.740
That's right.

49:37.740 --> 49:38.740
I mean, I talked to the White House.

49:38.740 --> 49:39.740
Trump, you did too.

49:39.740 --> 49:42.020
The White House is going to come to find out these people are running it.

49:42.020 --> 49:43.860
So that's the reason these ladies are a problem.

49:43.860 --> 49:44.860
Right.

49:44.860 --> 49:47.660
And then in our Georgia event, I announced that and now they're coming to take it off.

49:47.660 --> 49:51.020
So now they put out a flyer that they're going to Georgia and they had Georgia featured as

49:51.020 --> 49:53.420
a blue state and they misspelled Georgia.

49:53.420 --> 49:57.620
And so so you you and I were first to announce on our independent channels, we're marching

49:57.620 --> 49:58.620
to Georgia.

49:58.620 --> 50:01.060
And again, it's not about we don't give a damn about credit credit.

50:01.060 --> 50:03.020
These people come to us like you really care about.

50:03.020 --> 50:04.020
Right.

50:04.020 --> 50:05.020
And then they do media.

50:05.020 --> 50:07.580
And it sounds like there's a problem with those disgusting freaks because, you know,

50:07.580 --> 50:08.580
they don't present well.

50:08.580 --> 50:09.740
Look at these disgusting freaks.

50:09.740 --> 50:11.060
They're responsible for all they did.

50:11.060 --> 50:13.540
They told you about a stolen election.

50:13.540 --> 50:17.420
When Owen Schroyer got up to speak, he's saying four more years, Trump on the election.

50:17.420 --> 50:21.340
They tried to jerk him off the stage and even won a saying that he really won.

50:21.340 --> 50:28.220
So what's going on is that women for America first, that that group got the petition or

50:28.220 --> 50:29.220
got the permit.

50:29.220 --> 50:30.220
Yeah.

50:30.220 --> 50:31.820
And they organized the actual event.

50:31.820 --> 50:32.820
Right.

50:32.820 --> 50:37.420
It had a list of speakers that didn't include people like Alex.

50:37.420 --> 50:39.300
And well, they organized the event.

50:39.300 --> 50:44.500
Well, there were a lot of people who also decided to descend on Washington at the same

50:44.500 --> 50:45.500
time.

50:45.500 --> 50:46.500
Sure.

50:46.500 --> 50:47.500
But party crashers don't organize the party.

50:47.500 --> 50:52.980
Well, party crashers are actually more integral to the party than you're willing to.

50:52.980 --> 50:54.780
There is no party without the crasher.

50:54.780 --> 50:57.100
That doesn't sound true, but I guess I have to believe you.

50:57.100 --> 50:58.380
I don't have any evidence.

50:58.380 --> 51:02.780
Look, why isn't anybody talking about this kind of stuff, Dan?

51:02.780 --> 51:08.220
I find this fascinating because it's the same thing with like, okay, yeah, freedom works,

51:08.220 --> 51:17.420
Americans for Prosperity, Koch money, Koch funds, like Astroturfed a ton of the tea party

51:17.420 --> 51:19.140
in its early days.

51:19.140 --> 51:24.100
And then Alex glommed onto it and then accused them of taking his movement over.

51:24.100 --> 51:25.100
Yes, of course.

51:25.100 --> 51:27.020
And that's exactly what he's doing here.

51:27.020 --> 51:28.020
Yeah.

51:28.020 --> 51:31.360
And they won't let them hijack their hijack, Dan.

51:31.360 --> 51:38.540
Somebody's crashed this thing in DC and they rightfully probably were like, this is going

51:38.540 --> 51:40.580
to be tough to deal with.

51:40.580 --> 51:47.380
I understand maybe Alex speaking, but Alex's buddy, I don't know about this.

51:47.380 --> 51:51.400
And then they have the temerity to get on this show and accuse the people who are the

51:51.400 --> 51:55.420
actual organizers of stealing their event.

51:55.420 --> 51:56.420
The balls.

51:56.420 --> 52:00.020
And then to be like, they don't present well.

52:00.020 --> 52:07.240
I just like, like Alex does, I really want to like have these clips available just whenever

52:07.240 --> 52:10.780
I'm just like, oh, women for Trump.

52:10.780 --> 52:13.500
And it's like, man, you guys don't get it.

52:13.500 --> 52:18.020
The moment you step out of line, you're no longer for Trump.

52:18.020 --> 52:19.660
You're just women to them.

52:19.660 --> 52:23.680
And you know how they treat blank, just women.

52:23.680 --> 52:28.620
It is kind of shocking to see, like, so fast.

52:28.620 --> 52:32.740
You could not have organized that event, Alex.

52:32.740 --> 52:33.900
You could not have.

52:33.900 --> 52:34.900
We saw the caravan.

52:34.900 --> 52:35.900
Yeah, exactly.

52:35.900 --> 52:36.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:36.900 --> 52:38.800
Saw what you were capable of.

52:38.800 --> 52:47.340
The combined work of a ton of grifters added to the population that came to DC.

52:47.340 --> 52:54.820
But the actual event and people having a reason to be there was done by the work of the people

52:54.820 --> 52:56.540
who you were impugning.

52:56.540 --> 52:57.540
Yes.

52:57.540 --> 53:01.260
And that's why, like, if you're on the right, so stop trying.

53:01.260 --> 53:02.260
Just stop it.

53:02.260 --> 53:03.260
Yeah.

53:03.260 --> 53:04.260
Stop organizing these things.

53:04.260 --> 53:05.260
Just stop it.

53:05.260 --> 53:08.300
The people who want to come and get up there and yell and make you look bad and steal all

53:08.300 --> 53:10.820
your thunder are going to shit on you later.

53:10.820 --> 53:11.820
Yep.

53:11.820 --> 53:12.820
Yeah.

53:12.820 --> 53:13.820
You're being used.

53:13.820 --> 53:14.820
Yep.

53:14.820 --> 53:15.820
Every time.

53:15.820 --> 53:16.820
Oh, well.

53:16.820 --> 53:17.820
Anyway, Alex.

53:17.820 --> 53:18.820
No, these are my friends.

53:18.820 --> 53:20.340
They're not your friends.

53:20.340 --> 53:24.980
Alex is talking to Ali and he wants to know why is Georgia so important?

53:24.980 --> 53:26.620
Now recap why Georgia is so key.

53:26.620 --> 53:27.620
Robert Barnes is there.

53:27.620 --> 53:30.420
Everybody that's smart has been telling me for weeks, you're absolutely right, the White

53:30.420 --> 53:31.420
House agrees.

53:31.420 --> 53:32.420
George is key.

53:32.420 --> 53:34.420
How you doing there, buddy?

53:34.420 --> 53:37.540
So we got a long pause here.

53:37.540 --> 53:38.540
Alex?

53:38.540 --> 53:40.500
Alex, we lost you.

53:40.500 --> 53:41.500
Alex.

53:41.500 --> 53:43.100
Alex, this is mission command.

53:43.100 --> 53:45.020
Alex, wake up.

53:45.020 --> 53:48.780
Ground controls have made you tough.

53:48.780 --> 53:49.780
Weird.

53:49.780 --> 53:50.780
All right.

53:50.780 --> 53:54.860
So then it goes to commercial.

53:54.860 --> 53:56.180
I thought that was really strange.

53:56.180 --> 53:57.660
I mean, the feed just went out.

53:57.660 --> 53:58.660
Yeah.

53:58.660 --> 53:59.660
And I don't know what happened there.

53:59.660 --> 54:01.060
They don't address it when they come back, but...

54:01.060 --> 54:02.060
Too much flute.

54:02.060 --> 54:03.180
But here's the thing.

54:03.180 --> 54:06.420
I know that probably online that didn't happen.

54:06.420 --> 54:07.420
Sure.

54:07.420 --> 54:12.100
But I'm listening to it through the feed that goes to all of the radio stations that play

54:12.100 --> 54:13.980
Alex around the country.

54:13.980 --> 54:19.300
This is what's syndicated to shortwave too, so whoever's listening, it just cut out.

54:19.300 --> 54:20.300
Which is...

54:20.300 --> 54:21.340
That's not good.

54:21.340 --> 54:22.700
That's an audience you care about.

54:22.700 --> 54:25.160
That certainly, it's not great.

54:25.160 --> 54:28.980
They could really fix these problems.

54:28.980 --> 54:29.980
Maybe not.

54:29.980 --> 54:30.980
It's doable.

54:30.980 --> 54:31.980
I don't know.

54:31.980 --> 54:32.980
It's doable.

54:32.980 --> 54:33.980
But why?

54:33.980 --> 54:34.980
That's a good point.

54:34.980 --> 54:35.980
Anyway, Alex wants to know, where's Trump?

54:35.980 --> 54:36.980
Where's Trump?

54:36.980 --> 54:37.980
Hiding.

54:37.980 --> 54:38.980
Ally!

54:38.980 --> 54:39.980
Howard, he always was.

54:39.980 --> 54:41.540
Ally Alexander, tell me where Trump is.

54:41.540 --> 54:42.540
I hate you guys.

54:42.540 --> 54:43.540
Let me ask you this question.

54:43.540 --> 54:45.740
Why aren't we seeing a lot of Trump?

54:45.740 --> 54:47.140
Because that's his bully pulpit power.

54:47.140 --> 54:48.140
He still has.

54:48.140 --> 54:49.140
Why has he been so...

54:49.140 --> 54:51.380
We saw it tweeting and saying, I won the election yesterday.

54:51.380 --> 54:52.380
That's not enough.

54:52.380 --> 54:53.380
I mean, he should be in Georgia.

54:53.380 --> 54:54.380
He should be having rallies.

54:54.380 --> 54:56.140
I keep hearing he's going to have these rallies.

54:56.140 --> 54:57.140
When do those come?

54:57.140 --> 55:00.720
So the rallies were going to come and then there was a compromise reached inside the

55:00.720 --> 55:01.720
White House.

55:01.720 --> 55:02.720
So I'm just...

55:02.720 --> 55:04.200
It's my first time talking about it.

55:04.200 --> 55:09.740
And what they decided was until these cases start making their way through the courts,

55:09.740 --> 55:13.840
Trump does not want to position himself where the courts can hold a tweet against him or

55:13.840 --> 55:15.360
a rally against him.

55:15.360 --> 55:18.180
And so his tweets are very concentrated.

55:18.180 --> 55:19.180
Counterpoint.

55:19.180 --> 55:21.880
Alex just said that he tweeted the other day that I won the election.

55:21.880 --> 55:22.880
There is that.

55:22.880 --> 55:26.460
The Democrats are everywhere declaring victory fraudulently, calling him a dictator, but

55:26.460 --> 55:27.460
he's afraid to speak out.

55:27.460 --> 55:28.460
Right.

55:28.460 --> 55:29.460
That's ridiculous.

55:29.460 --> 55:30.460
And it is ridiculous.

55:30.460 --> 55:31.460
No, that sounds right.

55:31.460 --> 55:36.540
The courts held during the the ban, the terrorism ban that was described as the Muslim ban,

55:36.540 --> 55:38.060
they held a tweet against him.

55:38.060 --> 55:39.980
DACA, they held a tweet against him.

55:39.980 --> 55:42.860
So Trump is trying to play the legal strategy smart.

55:42.860 --> 55:43.860
Counterpoint.

55:43.860 --> 55:45.580
Trump tweeted, I won the election.

55:45.580 --> 55:49.100
Yeah, that is a really smart strategy, I think.

55:49.100 --> 55:50.100
Counterpoint.

55:50.100 --> 55:51.820
Trump tweeted something about Antifa scum.

55:51.820 --> 55:52.820
Yeah.

55:52.820 --> 55:53.820
Yeah.

55:53.820 --> 55:54.820
He seems to be.

55:54.820 --> 55:56.460
Your story doesn't hold water, Ali.

55:56.460 --> 55:58.820
No, no, no, no, no, no.

55:58.820 --> 56:01.900
You can make up all the fantasy fiction that you want.

56:01.900 --> 56:04.960
But Trump is a giant, cowardly loser.

56:04.960 --> 56:07.900
And I assume you guys are going to start killing all of us immediately.

56:07.900 --> 56:09.100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

56:09.100 --> 56:10.660
Trump wants to get out there, man.

56:10.660 --> 56:11.660
He wants.

56:11.660 --> 56:12.660
He does.

56:12.660 --> 56:13.660
No, he wants to play golf.

56:13.660 --> 56:14.660
He wants to get out there.

56:14.660 --> 56:15.660
He wants to do his rallies.

56:15.660 --> 56:16.660
There's plans to do rallies.

56:16.660 --> 56:17.660
See?

56:17.660 --> 56:19.300
In the meantime, stop the steal.us.

56:19.300 --> 56:24.920
We will keep posting rallies every state capitol, your noon, your local time until the electoral

56:24.920 --> 56:25.920
college meets.

56:25.920 --> 56:30.060
And maybe after that, maybe after that, maybe we never give this country back to them.

56:30.060 --> 56:35.720
He keeps calling it the electoral college, which is fun, but, uh, I don't care who gives

56:35.720 --> 56:36.720
a shit.

56:36.720 --> 56:37.720
Yeah.

56:37.720 --> 56:40.780
But it's like this thing is like, what he's doing is, Hey, yeah, Trump wants to come out

56:40.780 --> 56:41.980
and say hi to the people.

56:41.980 --> 56:45.680
He wants to be the figurehead, but he can't be, he's got to play it smart cause the courts.

56:45.680 --> 56:47.860
So for now it's just me.

56:47.860 --> 56:48.860
Here's my website.

56:48.860 --> 56:49.860
Wow.

56:49.860 --> 56:55.340
Fund us so we can have demonstrations at every state capitol and never give the country back.

56:55.340 --> 56:56.340
Whatever that means.

56:56.340 --> 56:57.700
See, I, I get it.

56:57.700 --> 57:02.780
And I understand why everybody is like mocking this and I get why people are writing so many

57:02.780 --> 57:07.780
op-eds and all this stuff that's like, Trump can't do a coup and this is just a grift and

57:07.780 --> 57:08.780
all that stuff.

57:08.780 --> 57:12.020
But it's like this grift is gonna run out.

57:12.020 --> 57:16.420
They don't just stop it when the grift runs out, they create a new grift and whatever

57:16.420 --> 57:18.420
they need to do.

57:18.420 --> 57:21.980
Whatever they need to do, they will do to continue that grift.

57:21.980 --> 57:22.980
Right.

57:22.980 --> 57:23.980
It's not a joke, man.

57:23.980 --> 57:24.980
Right.

57:24.980 --> 57:25.980
Right.

57:25.980 --> 57:26.980
Right.

57:26.980 --> 57:29.820
It is primarily a scam that people like Alex and Allie are running.

57:29.820 --> 57:30.820
Sure.

57:30.820 --> 57:35.900
But the scam, if taken seriously, it's super dangerous.

57:35.900 --> 57:36.900
Terrifying.

57:36.900 --> 57:44.820
And in the past when it's been a scam that's hurt civilians and normal people, you know,

57:44.820 --> 57:46.300
it's awful and it is what it is.

57:46.300 --> 57:49.940
But now it's a game where you could hurt the whole country.

57:49.940 --> 57:50.940
Yeah, the world.

57:50.940 --> 57:51.940
And yeah.

57:51.940 --> 57:52.940
Yeah.

57:52.940 --> 57:53.940
Yeah.

57:53.940 --> 57:54.940
The world.

57:54.940 --> 57:55.940
Yeah, it's too much.

57:55.940 --> 58:00.860
Now, I've had a theory for this whole time that Allie Alexander was working with Roger

58:00.860 --> 58:08.080
Stone on Stop the Steal because it is the same name as Roger Stone's alleged poll watching

58:08.080 --> 58:10.600
organization from 2016.

58:10.600 --> 58:13.240
And I didn't need to actually do any further research on it.

58:13.240 --> 58:14.240
They just told me he was.

58:14.240 --> 58:15.240
Nice.

58:15.240 --> 58:19.180
Allie Alexander, a great political analyst and also publisher, is here with us.

58:19.180 --> 58:24.140
He's been a tireless fighter with Roger Stone starting Start the Steal a Few Years ago with

58:24.140 --> 58:27.060
Roger and then Roger's handed the baton to him.

58:27.060 --> 58:28.780
Roger's going to be in Atlanta, Georgia tomorrow.

58:28.780 --> 58:30.420
I'm going to be there tonight.

58:30.420 --> 58:31.420
Okay.

58:31.420 --> 58:32.420
So I was right.

58:32.420 --> 58:33.420
Yep.

58:33.420 --> 58:34.420
This is all connected.

58:34.420 --> 58:35.420
Yep.

58:35.420 --> 58:36.420
Yep.

58:36.420 --> 58:37.940
If Alex is to be believed, which he's usually not.

58:37.940 --> 58:38.980
True.

58:38.980 --> 58:41.140
But this seems like something that makes total sense.

58:41.140 --> 58:42.140
Yeah.

58:42.140 --> 58:43.140
I mean, it's Roger's domain.

58:43.140 --> 58:44.140
Yeah.

58:44.140 --> 58:47.780
He was licensed, he registered it, and now he's taken his cut.

58:47.780 --> 58:48.780
Yep.

58:48.780 --> 58:50.460
I have no doubt he's taken a cut.

58:50.460 --> 58:53.060
Well, and here's the thing.

58:53.060 --> 58:59.100
If this is a conspiracy, all conspirators can be charged with every aspect of a crime.

58:59.100 --> 59:00.100
Rico.

59:00.100 --> 59:01.100
Exactly.

59:01.100 --> 59:05.340
So, if Allie follows through with his plan.

59:05.340 --> 59:06.340
Okay.

59:06.340 --> 59:07.340
Roger might be in trouble.

59:07.340 --> 59:08.340
Good.

59:08.340 --> 59:09.340
I'm going to just leak out our plan, Alex.

59:09.340 --> 59:14.260
They've talked about doing, oh, we're going to elect Joe Biden and do a virtual inauguration.

59:14.260 --> 59:15.260
Good.

59:15.260 --> 59:18.900
Then Alex and I will fill the streets with 5 million patriots.

59:18.900 --> 59:20.780
And Trump will be there and we'll inaugurate him, doesn't it?

59:20.780 --> 59:21.780
We'll inaugurate Donald Trump.

59:21.780 --> 59:24.060
Because the Democrats said they were going to do that if Trump won.

59:24.060 --> 59:25.060
Yeah.

59:25.060 --> 59:26.060
That they would just break the victory up.

59:26.060 --> 59:27.060
When?

59:27.060 --> 59:28.060
Well, we're not going to break it up.

59:28.060 --> 59:29.060
When?

59:29.060 --> 59:30.060
We're going to reconstitute it.

59:30.060 --> 59:31.060
Who said that?

59:31.060 --> 59:32.420
If you guys want to act as insurrectionists, well, then we know how to deal with that.

59:32.420 --> 59:33.740
But we will bring tents.

59:33.740 --> 59:34.860
We will bring trucks.

59:34.860 --> 59:35.860
We will bring cars.

59:35.860 --> 59:36.860
I agree.

59:36.860 --> 59:40.700
And now is the time after Georgia to start occupying DC, period.

59:40.700 --> 59:45.940
So apparently the plan is occupying DC, which you're going to get bored of very quickly,

59:45.940 --> 59:46.940
Alex.

59:46.940 --> 59:49.300
You have no ability to run anything like this.

59:49.300 --> 59:50.300
No, no, no, no.

59:50.300 --> 59:54.220
You have no interest in anything that, especially once the cameras stop, like one of the things

59:54.220 --> 59:59.640
about those kinds of occupations is that they get boring after a while.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:04.980
People might cover it for a bit and then there's long periods where there aren't cameras, there's

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:07.740
no attention and you don't have, you're not built for that.

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:09.260
So no, you're not going to do that.

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:13.100
But assuming that you do, you're not going to get 5 million people to come to DC.

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.100
No.

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:15.100
That is not going to happen.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:16.100
No.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.940
And let's imagine what's going to happen if you try and inaugurate a second president.

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:20.940
No, that'll work.

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:21.940
No.

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:22.940
Dark Pope.

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:23.940
It'll be fine.

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:24.940
We'll have two Popes.

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:26.380
Somebody will dig up Biden's remains and put them on trial.

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.380
It'd be great.

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:33.420
I'm fascinated by trying- I'm just remembering my medieval warfare

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:34.420
history.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:39.140
I remember people writing down, sieges were our favorite part.

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:40.140
You know?

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:45.060
That four months of waiting for supply lines to catch up, sitting there going hungry, not

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.260
fighting anybody, just sitting there in a tent.

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:52.140
I think Alex wants his listeners to do that while buying survival food from him.

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.140
Exactly.

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:54.140
To keep rations.

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:55.140
Of course.

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:58.100
And then Alex will show up with a bullhorn every now and again and take credit for everything.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.340
Like medieval kings fighting a war.

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.340
Sure.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:02.340
Yeah.

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:08.100
So let's try and think about what in the real world would that look like if Alex- I mean

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:12.300
first of all, it's a leap to imagine five million people would show up.

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.780
So let's stipulate that five million do show up.

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:16.780
Sure.

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:19.940
Now they decide they're going to inaugurate Trump though he lost the election.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:20.940
Well.

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:23.940
What happens then?

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:26.300
I guess we divide up territories?

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:29.940
I mean, I don't know.

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.740
The mind reels.

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:35.180
Steve Pachanik might get a job.

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:37.460
I'm telling you, I'm just telling you.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:39.020
We just got to isolate him.

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:40.460
We just got to isolate him.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:42.820
We give him, we give him all Alaska.

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:43.820
It's the biggest state.

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.540
The old werewolf treatment.

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.540
Exactly.

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:49.300
Take all of these, take all of them and say, you know what?

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.300
We agree with everything you're doing.

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.700
We love what's going on.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:53.900
There's a lot of resources in Alaska.

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.380
We're going to say- But what about the good people of Alaska?

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.140
We're starting a pilot program.

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:01.700
We want to put your ideas into action, but we're not sure because they're not tried and

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:02.700
tested yet.

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:08.360
So we want to move all conservatives to Alaska and you guys just work it out there and then

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.380
bring it back to us whenever you're ready.

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:13.260
I feel like this is not fair to the people who live in Alaska.

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:14.260
Oh, that's true.

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:15.260
Yeah.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:16.260
That is definitely true.

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.260
Oh well.

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:18.260
The moon.

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:19.260
We'll give Alaskans Hawaii.

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:20.260
Ooh.

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:23.540
And then we'll give Hawaii to Japan.

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:24.540
Wait.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.540
This is going to get out of control.

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:27.940
Now I'm trying to rebook everything and it's trouble.

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:30.140
So let's leave that aside for another day.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.140
All right.

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:32.140
Alex gets it.

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:36.860
He's been doing on this episode his Brian Stelter impression, which is not a good impression.

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:37.860
That one's great.

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.020
Now it's really funny because apparently it's not his.

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:45.260
Brian Stelter goes, there's no evidence and they have none and they shouldn't be on air.

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:49.480
Don't go watch them because we have hours and hours of evidence a day.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.480
It's ridiculous.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:53.540
You know, Mark Dies would be proud of that impression.

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:57.300
Well, I mean, I'm not saying Mark ripped me off, he's done a great job, but I was already

01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:58.300
doing it.

01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.300
I believe that.

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:00.300
Okay.

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:01.300
I don't.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.300
I don't either.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.300
I don't either.

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.300
I don't either.

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:05.300
I don't either.

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:06.300
I don't either.

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:07.300
Alex stole Brian Stelter impression from Mark Dies.

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:08.300
Sad.

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:11.340
The thing that always makes me feel like an alien to these people is what they laugh at.

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:12.340
Yeah.

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:15.140
Like, was that that funny?

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:17.060
What did you laugh at, Ali?

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.660
What did you laugh at?

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:20.420
Was it just that he did a voice?

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:22.300
I think so.

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:23.300
And if so.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.300
Ooh.

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:31.940
Yeah, well, I mean, I think that that was one of the challenges of doing standup was,

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.820
first of all, not thinking the things that I said were that funny.

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:35.820
Sure.

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:36.820
That's a big challenge.

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:37.820
And often the audience agreeing.

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:38.820
Yeah.

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:43.580
And then, you know, things that I saw other people say that weren't all that funny and

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.220
audiences thinking they were hilarious.

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:46.220
Sure.

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:47.860
You know, people have different senses of humor.

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:48.860
There's no accounting for that.

01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:49.860
Totally.

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:50.860
And it's bewildering.

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:51.860
Yeah.

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:56.980
I'll tell you a few that the stuff on InfoWars that is humorous to those folks who are on

01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.980
as guests.

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:02.380
It's worse than anything, most things that I've seen at comedy shows.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.900
Yeah, it feels alien.

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.900
It really does.

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:11.140
Because in comedy, you know, you've seen every kind of, I've seen the gamut of people trying

01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:14.220
to be funny all across the board.

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:18.540
And even they have nothing, there's nothing like this.

01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:24.540
This is just a series of people who only understand each other and laugh at these weird things

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:27.380
that are just divorced from reality.

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.380
Yeah.

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.380
It's wild.

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:36.380
I mean, so much of comedy and so much of what you find funny is the ability to understand

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:41.260
sort of shared perceptions or shared ideas.

01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:47.340
And I think once people have such fractured realities that they live in, it makes sense

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:49.300
that humor wouldn't translate at all.

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:50.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:51.300
Between them.

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.300
Yeah.

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:53.300
That's sad.

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:56.580
How could you make a joke about the sun rising if they're like, we've never seen the sun and

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.580
it's dark all the time.

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:58.580
And you're like, okay.

01:04:58.580 --> 01:04:59.580
It'd be tough.

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.980
There's no shared point of commonality.

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:05.140
So in this next clip, Ali yells that he's signing his death warrant and he's going to

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:07.780
fight this thing all the way to his grave.

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:11.860
And so all of these guys, I'm so proud to be working with you, Alex, and you, Ed.

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:13.180
We've got to rush the gates.

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:18.740
We've got to be the barbarians that rush the gates in the castle, or we're all dead.

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:19.740
It's really that simple.

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:22.220
So I'm signing my death warrant.

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:24.140
It's liberty or it's death.

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.460
Alex, I think you're in the same boat.

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:28.820
Oh, I'm total commitment.

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:30.980
Every cell in my body is commanding me to take action.

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:32.740
I'm not in control.

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:38.180
I just remembered when he got sued by Chobani and Alex said, I will fight this.

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:40.620
I will win or I will die.

01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:43.360
I will win or he settled a week later.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.180
I'm real sorry about that stuff that I did.

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.180
I will win or die.

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:49.180
That's you know what?

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.860
A error of my ways.

01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:55.580
Look, Hamdi Ulukaya, I am so sorry that I said those things about you.

01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:56.580
Please don't sue me.

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:57.580
Please don't sue me.

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.580
Uh, okay.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:59.580
Alex, whatever.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.580
Oh boy.

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:01.580
Anyway, uh, Ali leaves.

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:05.460
I guess he's got to head down to Georgia for Alex to meet him down there.

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:11.700
And Alex takes some calls and this is such a fucking performance on Alex's part.

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:17.460
I believe that what's going on here is that Alex thinks that this caller is nuts and he

01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:18.900
doesn't want to talk to him.

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.940
So he decides to pretend to be mad about something else.

01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.700
Dave in Nevada.

01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:25.700
You're on the air, Dave.

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:26.700
Yes.

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:32.900
My topic is predictions on the coronal mass ejection, uh, brain shifts and the report.

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:34.920
You see, you know, we're not screening your call.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.500
You're actually on air live right now.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:37.500
Sure.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.500
Oh, put you on hold, put you on hold.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.580
Listen, I have a thing, I put you on hold, I have a thing about callers.

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:46.980
I love you to death, but I'm not other talk shows where I pre-screen you for an hour.

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:47.980
Want to have you a clean phone.

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:50.140
You want to tell us what you're calling in about a scrape.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.220
Once you get on air, you tell us what you want to cover.

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.860
You don't have to ask permission, sir.

01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:55.860
He wasn't.

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.620
He was telling you what his topic was.

01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:58.940
Coronal mass ejection.

01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:03.860
His phone sounded fine compared to the callers that you generally have on this show.

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:04.860
Real easy.

01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:09.180
He wants to talk about predicting coronal mass eject ejections, brain chips.

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:10.180
Yep.

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:12.660
And I think Alex was like, I don't want to fucking talk to this dude.

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:13.660
Nope.

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:14.980
I want to get mad at him for no reason.

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:15.980
Exactly.

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:17.540
And then it continues.

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:20.620
Once you get on air, you tell us what you want to cover.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.900
You don't have to ask permission, sir.

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:26.020
If you ask for permission, I will hang up on you.

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:28.780
That's the one rule is no censorship and no screening.

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.100
Let's try again, Dave.

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:31.100
I love you.

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.100
Go ahead.

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:33.100
You're free man, brother.

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:34.100
Go ahead.

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.100
It's okay.

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:36.100
This is going to sound like numerology.

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:37.100
Okay.

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:40.100
You just asked for permission again, dude.

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.100
Don't do it.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.100
Did he?

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.100
Just go.

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.540
He did not ask for permission again.

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:50.020
He's he was giving a caveat that this is going to sound like numerology, but I was more preamble

01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:51.020
than anybody else.

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:52.020
Yeah.

01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:54.020
That was, that was softening the numerology that was about to come.

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:55.020
Yeah.

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:56.020
Yeah.

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:57.020
This is going to sound like numerology because it is.

01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:59.620
But if I say this is going to sound like numerology, maybe you'll think it isn't.

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:00.620
Yeah.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:02.460
Maybe you'll think that I'm more of a rational actor in this whole thing.

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:03.460
Yeah.

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:06.180
I think just as like, yeah, all right, I don't want to do this.

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:09.780
I don't want to take whatever this guy's saying seriously, but you know, whatever.

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:15.060
I'll just get mad about my weird idea about anti-censorship of phone calls.

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.060
Yeah.

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:17.060
Very strange.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.060
Sure buddy.

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.060
Very strange.

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:23.780
So Alex takes another call and this guy wants you to not take a vaccine.

01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:30.860
And then thankfully Alex starts talking about his idea of this karma and the whole sort

01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:34.820
of thing about like, you need, the globalists need to trick you into doing things for moral

01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:35.820
reasons.

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:36.820
Galactic law.

01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:37.820
Sure.

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:41.100
And Mike down for this cause you might get a little confused cause it's confusing.

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:42.100
Fair.

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:46.800
But this is perhaps the only thing that like really fascinates me about Alex anymore.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.900
This idea of his bizarre ethical system.

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:54.140
They can dial up the radiation and they can inject you with anything they want to.

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:59.900
You got to make sure that you don't take anything that, that, that they're pushing out and don't

01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:03.620
feel they can spray it on you, but metaphysically they get the bad karma.

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:04.700
They believe from it.

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:05.980
They need you to agree.

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:11.940
They can pressure you, but they need you to agree so they don't get at least the instant

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:12.940
karma.

01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:13.940
It's how the dimensions work.

01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:14.940
I don't understand it all.

01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:15.940
They know it's a law.

01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:16.940
So do I.

01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:17.940
You make somebody do something.

01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:18.940
You get instant karma.

01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:24.660
You get interdimensional karma when you die for sins, even if you manipulated the field

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:29.820
or however it works, but they need to trick us to go along with it and at least acquiesce.

01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:31.340
That's their satanic operation.

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:34.300
They need us like in the garden to agree to it.

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:35.300
Does that make sense?

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.940
No, not, not, not one bit.

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:38.940
Nope.

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:45.560
So if I understand correctly, instant karma isn't after you die.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.560
That is like now.

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.260
No, it's instant karma, right?

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:50.460
Which is real.

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:54.660
So, but I don't think that history backs that up.

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:55.660
No, it does.

01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:56.660
No, it doesn't.

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:58.660
I don't think it does.

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:01.660
What about all the monsters who died in their beds?

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:04.860
Oh, but you missed out all the instant karma that did happen.

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:05.860
Oh, sure.

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:06.860
Like they stubbed their toe?

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:07.860
Exactly.

01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:08.860
Great.

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:09.860
Yeah.

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:10.860
Great.

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:11.860
Instant karma.

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:12.860
I don't think that this works.

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:15.020
I think you're going to have a really tough time explaining how this system has ever operated.

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.020
Sure, sure.

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:17.020
Human history.

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.020
Sure.

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:22.980
Especially if you go back to like times when, like feudal times.

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:26.380
How did instant karma work back then?

01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:28.580
When life was cheap in the back ages.

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:33.180
So do you remember, so there was a, I can't remember, but it was, I can't remember if

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:38.420
it was Roman or if it was not, but I feel like in my head it's Roman.

01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:39.860
The metal bull.

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:41.740
Do you remember the metal bull?

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:42.740
The golden bull.

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:48.100
And they would put a human being inside the bull and light the fire underneath it, making

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:52.900
that person burn alive inside of the bull while the king laughed.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.540
I feel like you're talking about Game of Thrones.

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:56.140
No, this is not Game of Thrones.

01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:57.140
It's real.

01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:58.140
Okay.

01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:03.180
And that guy absolutely had diarrhea that night.

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:05.220
And that's what happens.

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:06.220
Instant karma, Dan.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:07.220
Sure.

01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:08.220
It's, it's tough.

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:09.220
Yeah.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:12.180
It's tough for me to wrap my head around this.

01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:17.820
Now Alex seems to also be saying that even if you manipulate the system and get people

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:25.140
to do things of their own volition, you'll still have bad sin karma after you die.

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.140
Of course.

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:27.140
Well naturally.

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:28.140
What?

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:33.060
Haven't you seen the scoreboards that follow us around everywhere and sit on top of our

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:34.060
left shoulder?

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:35.660
Am I the only person who can see the scoreboard?

01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:36.660
I think so.

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.660
Oh shit.

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:38.660
Cause this makes perfect sense to me.

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:39.660
You and Alex.

01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:41.460
If you look at this scoreboard right over here.

01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:48.940
I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit worried about the real world application of this moral

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:49.940
system.

01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:50.940
Sure.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.420
I'm a little bit worried about it.

01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:58.860
For one, if you believe this moral system and then let's say you violate someone's free

01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:01.540
will and then there's no instant karma.

01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:03.460
Oh my God.

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:05.620
I must not have violated their free will.

01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:06.620
Uh oh.

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:07.620
There we go.

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:08.620
This could teach you the wrong lessons.

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:10.960
I wasn't instantly karmad.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:14.620
So furthermore, furthermore, here's the biggest issue.

01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:15.620
You know what?

01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:20.200
That kind of implies is that anything that you do, if God doesn't strike you down for

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:27.180
doing it, it must be okay until after when you find out, well, but then it's not like

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:28.180
instant karma.

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:29.180
It's just bad.

01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:30.180
It's not that bad.

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:31.180
No, no, no.

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:34.700
Whatever you did to somebody they must've been fine with or else God would have given

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:35.700
you instant karma.

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:36.700
Of course he would.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:39.880
So the fact that you're still standing and don't have, what the fuck?

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:44.220
I think my biggest issue is that they can quote pressure you.

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:45.220
Yeah.

01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:46.220
Now what does that mean?

01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:47.220
Wow.

01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:48.900
What are the limits of pressure?

01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:53.380
They can pressure you into agreeing with them, but they'll still be in trouble after they

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:54.380
die.

01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.780
They'll just not have instant karma if they pressure you.

01:12:56.780 --> 01:13:00.940
So they can just, they can just torture you endlessly until you agree.

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:07.220
What if they send a robot with a gun and a little...

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:11.060
Cause I would say that's not pressure.

01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:12.060
Is Dalek pressure?

01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:13.060
I think that's the question.

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:16.340
I think Alex is saying that it is, but it's absolutely not.

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:17.340
All right.

01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:25.180
If the globalists have to get you to agree to do things, Dalek's with guns is not pressure.

01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:30.020
That's force.

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:31.020
That's pressure.

01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:32.020
No, it's not.

01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:33.020
That's just pressure.

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:36.500
Now, if the gun actually kills the person, that's instant karma.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:40.060
But as long as you're just pressuring them with the threat of shooting them.

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.780
The threat of the gun is not pressure.

01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.280
Not instant karma, that's pressure.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.020
That's an inappropriate level of pressure.

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:48.900
Well, see, that's why I don't like when he says pressure.

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:54.500
I think it is debatable, you know, the whole idea of like, did I make you do something

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:55.900
cause I pointed a gun at you?

01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:56.900
Sure.

01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:00.680
Like if I make you rob a store when I'm pointing a gun at you, are you morally culpable or

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.900
should you have gotten shot instead of...

01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:03.900
Sure, sure, sure.

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:04.900
Actually, this is a stupid conversation.

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:05.900
It is.

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:06.900
Of course I forced you to do it.

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:07.900
Yeah.

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:08.900
Naturally.

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:09.900
You got a gun on me.

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:10.900
Yes.

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:15.340
So the robot with a gun is not pressure, that's force.

01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:19.700
This moral system makes no sense, but I want Alex to talk about it for an hour.

01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:23.980
Honestly, I think even a robot with a swab is maybe force.

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:26.800
A robot comes up to you with a swab?

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.500
That's a little bit intimidating.

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:30.620
I mean, it's weird.

01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:32.920
If there's no gun, it's not force.

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.700
You could just then walk away from the robot.

01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:38.660
It's not Rosie the main robot from the Jetsons.

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:41.340
But if it's a Dalek, you can outrun it.

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:42.340
Close a door.

01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:43.500
No, Daleks can fly.

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:44.500
Not these ones.

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.500
Not real ones.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:46.500
Not real ones.

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:49.220
Alright, well, I'll have to call Matt Smith and see what he can do about this.

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:54.300
Anyway, I just want Alex to do a fucking whole special episode about this weird moral system.

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:55.300
Gotta.

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:59.460
And I'd love him to do like a call-in show where people can ask him questions to refine

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:00.460
some of these ideas.

01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:01.460
Absolutely.

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:02.460
I want him to have a chalkboard.

01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:04.220
I think it would fall apart so fast.

01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:06.500
I really want him to try and explain it.

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:10.020
I really do, because it is bonunkers.

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:16.940
So now Alex takes another call, and something happens that happens more than I would like

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:20.860
to admit, and that is this caller tells Alex about a dream he had.

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:21.860
Oh, of course.

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:22.860
Thanks, sir.

01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:23.860
I'll take my call, brother.

01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:24.860
Yes, sir.

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:30.580
Alex, I just wanted to reiterate a dream I had approximately 16 years ago.

01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:32.360
A dream goes like this.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.860
I had crossed a gigantic cavern.

01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.220
I don't know how I crossed it.

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:37.220
I didn't know where to go.

01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:38.940
And I laid down on my back.

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:44.400
I looked up to heaven, and I saw a blue spiraling light, and this blue spiraling light turned

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.520
into like a tornado.

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:52.060
And out of that blue spiraling light, a dove formed, a blue dove.

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:57.180
And I felt liquid love raindrops going entirely through me.

01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:02.220
And a voice like a trumpet spoke to me and said, a moment is only for a moment, but a

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:04.140
moment lasts forever.

01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:07.940
And Alex, this is America's moment to stand up.

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:11.760
If this moment is missed, this moment will pass forever.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.060
There's a shelf life on it, and kudos for you for going to Georgia today.

01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:17.060
They're right.

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:21.300
It's a dimensional jump point where they've liquefied the energy field for the future,

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:23.620
and we have to remold things now.

01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:25.300
What are those words?

01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:27.180
They've liquefied the jump gate?

01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:28.180
What are you talking about?

01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:29.180
Of course.

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:30.180
Of course.

01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:31.180
Fuck off.

01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:32.180
They liquefied the jump gate.

01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:34.380
I had a dream that I was skateboarding last night.

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.500
Anyway, this guy apparently-

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:43.740
I got to tell you about a dream I had 16 years ago, so I was 17 years old, and I had this

01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:44.740
dream-

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:45.740
Look, I love you.

01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:46.740
You're my best friend.

01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:47.740
I don't want to hear your fucking dream.

01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:48.740
No, no, no.

01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:49.740
You want to hear this dream.

01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:50.740
It's really incredible.

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:51.740
No, no.

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.420
So I had this dream, and there was this cat, and it was climbing up a tree.

01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:54.660
You know like cats do.

01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:58.000
And then I saw this blinding light, and so did the cat.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.660
And you know the cat saw it because the light blinded the cat so much that it fell, and

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:06.460
it was holding onto the tree just by its bare paws.

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:12.300
And a deep, booming voice said, hang in there, kitty.

01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:14.260
And I just always hung onto that, Dan.

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:15.660
Well, it's a meaningful thing.

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:17.140
It's a meaningful thing.

01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:23.620
I like the idea that some people are going to maybe protest outside capitals and be like,

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:24.620
the time is now.

01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:29.900
I mean, or else why would that guy who called Alex Jones' show have had that dream 16 years

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:30.900
ago?

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:31.900
That's ludicrous.

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:36.700
I just want to reiterate a dream I had 16 years ago.

01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:39.660
Is the last sentence I want to hear anyone say ever.

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:43.820
I have to assume Alex in that moment was like, I'm so mad I freaked out at that caller earlier.

01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:45.820
I should have freaked out at this guy first.

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:46.820
God damn it.

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:47.820
I should have saved the freak out.

01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:49.460
I blew it too soon.

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:54.220
Anyway, we have one last clip, and it's sort of an intro to our Monday episode.

01:17:54.220 --> 01:18:01.620
Well, I'm on my way, and I'm not the devil, just a little bit, but I love Jesus.

01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:07.340
And so I'm on my way to Georgia, and I'm going to be with Roger Stone, Ollie Alexander, and

01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:09.340
so many others fighting the steel.

01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:10.340
Very exciting.

01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:15.980
Join us Monday on Knowledge Fight as we discuss Care of Vanity Project part three.

01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:17.300
The Texan went down to Georgia.

01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:21.060
He was looking for a stop the steel.

01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:27.000
So I'm excited about that kind of, I'm excited about the idea of like, I'm playing by my

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
own rules.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.700
Like, we're going to cover this show, but I think a bottle episode where we talk about

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:38.100
his time in Georgia makes more sense than us covering Wednesday at the end of this episode.

01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:39.100
Agreed.

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:41.500
Like the caravan, perfect two-parter.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:42.500
Makes total sense.

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:43.500
Absolutely.

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:44.500
And let me tell you something.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:48.500
I shot on it a little bit, but that was a very well-written parody song.

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:49.500
Thank you.

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:50.500
That was very well-written.

01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:51.500
It was a good parody song.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.060
I will be genuine for this one moment.

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:54.420
This is very nice of you to say.

01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:58.020
I will admit, in hindsight, there were some meter problems.

01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.820
There were a couple big ones.

01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:04.260
That's the problem whenever you write it out and you don't sing it, you know, perfectly

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:05.260
in advance.

01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:06.260
Yeah.

01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:09.460
I mean, I might've reread it.

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:19.540
Anyway, I think that this was a little bit of a preamble episode in some ways.

01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:23.860
I feel like this was getting ready to go to Georgia.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:29.100
And it's this, he's just got back from DC and now he's about to leave again.

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:32.220
There's this weird middle place where it's like, fuck, I don't know, I'm going to hang

01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:35.060
out with Ali Alexander and all the Proud Boys.

01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:37.020
Yeah, it's a layover in the airport.

01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:38.020
Yeah, kind of.

01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:39.020
But it's his home.

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:40.020
Yeah.

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:43.540
He is a nomad for the 79 days of hell.

01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:48.980
He is a man adrift running around the country, hither and yon, trying to find attention wherever

01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:49.980
it might be.

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:52.420
He is going to have to do that, I guess.

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.420
Yeah.

01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:54.420
That's like what he's got to do.

01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:59.980
I will say, on the one hand, I'm glad it doesn't come off as desperate.

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:00.980
I guess.

01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:03.140
I was being facetious.

01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:08.380
Anyway, we'll be back on Monday, but until then, we have a website.

01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:09.380
We do have a website.

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:10.380
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:11.380
You bet it is.

01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:12.380
We're also on Twitter.

01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:13.380
We are on Twitter.

01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:14.900
It's at knowledge underscore fight and at go to bed Jordan.

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:17.040
We are on Facebook.

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.040
We are on Facebook.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:23.100
And if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:24.580
doing God's work right now.

01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:25.580
Yeah.

01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:26.580
We'll be back.

01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:27.580
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:28.580
I'm Leo.

01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:29.580
I'm DZX Clark.

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:30.580
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:33.780
We accept all callers except for censored.

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:34.860
I don't know how to do this one.

01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:35.860
I fucked up.

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:36.860
Sorry.

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:37.860
Andy in Kansas.

01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:38.860
You're on the air.

01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:39.860
Thanks for holding.

01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:40.860
Hello, Alex.

01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:41.860
I'm a first time caller.

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:42.860
I'm a huge fan.

01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:43.860
I love your work.

01:20:43.860 --> 01:21:10.820
I love you.
