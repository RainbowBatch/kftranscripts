00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,960
N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,200
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,040
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys, knowledgefight.

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:47,120
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:01:02,600
Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan, I'm Jordan, we're a couple dudes

8
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,200
that sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,780
Oh indeed we are, Dan, Jordan, I have a quick question for you, what's up, what's your bright

10
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,780
spot today?

11
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:17,680
What's your bright spot today, Jordan, paradoxically, very strange, unexpectedly, social media.

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,160
Social media, the thing that you have left as soon as you finally realized after eight

13
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,040
months that you should have been gone from it two years ago.

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,860
Yeah, I don't like social media in a lot of its manifestations, permutations, because

15
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,240
I find that it just doesn't match with the way my brain works.

16
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,280
Not no shade on people who do enjoy it or like Twitter and Facebook and stuff, I just,

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,880
it's not for me.

18
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,620
As I've gotten older I recognize that it's confusing, I don't like, when I was running

19
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:55,320
the knowledgefight Twitter account, and it became a thing where it's like, I know I'm

20
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:03,940
using this, everybody who listens to the show knows I'm using this, so if I post promo stuff,

21
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,940
it feels dirty.

22
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,320
It feels like, I don't know, it's a good aversion to self-promotion, but.

24
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
I understand.

25
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,800
Anyway, the reason that I'm throwing a bright spot to social media is I started to think

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,680
about like, what are ways that social media can be used in ways that are fun and not dumb,

27
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,020
and everyone keeps asking for pictures of my plants, and so I've started an Instagram

28
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,000
account called Plant Underscore Fight.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Alright, alright.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,400
Where I'm going to post pictures of plants.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
I like it.

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,100
And so far people have enjoyed it, I've posted a picture of the quinoa so far, and periodically

33
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:46,600
it will feature different plants from around Dan's wild kingdom, but I figured it's not

34
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:53,520
connected to the show, it's not too intrusive on my personal life, and it felt like that

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,880
nice sweet spot, and something that people enjoy.

36
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
People like seeing these plants.

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Yeah, I think so.

38
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
I think so.

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,360
Yeah, so I think maybe this is a function that social media can serve, although I still

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,120
think most of it's trash.

41
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Here's what we'll do.

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,440
I'll make an Instagram account for my two dogs.

43
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,080
People have asked for me to post pictures of your dogs.

44
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,400
Yeah, I'll go with Westies Underscore Fight will compete to see whose, I guess, growing

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,840
things are better.

46
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,320
I'm afraid that your dogs are cuter than most of my plants.

47
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,680
I think I'd probably lose that Underscore Fight.

48
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,160
But I'm not as popular as you, Dan.

49
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
I don't know about that.

50
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Oh yeah.

51
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
So what's your bright spot?

52
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:41,480
My bright spot today, Dan, is back to Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but it is a specific reference

53
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,300
in Valhalla that I particularly enjoyed that came out of nowhere, which was a reference

54
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,480
to One Punch Man.

55
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,040
Do you know about One Punch Man?

56
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,520
Vaguely, yeah.

57
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:57,840
Yeah, so One Punch Man is a manga and an anime about a very depressed guy who can defeat

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
anything and anyone in one punch.

59
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,720
Yes, I believe you've told me about this.

60
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,960
Yeah, and he's so existentially destroyed by that, like how bored and awful it is to

61
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:14,640
be the ultimate power in the universe, I guess, that he's just a real bummer all the time.

62
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,320
And there's a perfect reference to that in Valhalla, where you have to fight a guy who

63
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,880
will always defeat you in one punch, and he's a real bummer about it.

64
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,720
People could have guessed that was going to be the spoiler.

65
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
Well, yeah.

66
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
It's a reference, yeah.

67
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
So it's very, very, very funny.

68
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
That's nice.

69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
I enjoyed it.

70
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
It's my little Easter egg.

71
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,840
It's nice to be surprised by a little reference in there.

72
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,840
Sure.

73
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
Ah, it's good.

74
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
I have a gripe.

75
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,400
I don't know what the deal is, but I lost a bunch of time on Valhalla.

76
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,600
Did you have a corrupted save where you kept falling through the...

77
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,040
No, I had a bug, though, that I ran into.

78
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Ooh.

79
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,120
And that was... maybe this is just one of those problems that happens when you play

80
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,860
games when they first come out that I'm not really used to.

81
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:03,440
But there's a mission at a certain point where, without any spoilers, you talk to a guy, and

82
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,240
then you've got to get to another city.

83
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Sure.

84
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,520
You've got to take a boat to get to the other city, and every single time after I talked

85
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,880
to this guy, the boat would spawn in the middle of land.

86
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,080
Like, just as if it were a horse.

87
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Sure.

88
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Sure.

89
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
Just in the middle of a path.

90
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,520
I can't do anything with this.

91
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:34,640
And so I had to go back to my most recent autosave file, and it had autosaved so many

92
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,080
times while that boat was still there.

93
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Sure, sure.

94
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,720
You restarted, like, 50 times, and all your autosaves wound up getting you back to where

95
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
the boat was.

96
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,960
So the last save before that was a great mistake.

97
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
Four hours.

98
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
Yeah.

99
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Yeah.

100
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Yeah.

101
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
It was very frustrating, but it is what it is.

102
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,720
Yeah, I had the same thing happen on one mission.

103
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,120
All of a sudden, every time I loaded the save, the entire screen would just start shaking,

104
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,920
and then my character would just fall directly through, and then fall forever until she died.

105
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,480
And that was it.

106
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,600
Even great games, you know, sometimes there are little problems.

107
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,760
Eh, launch date, release bugs, it happens.

108
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Yeah.

109
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,320
And you know the other thing that's really exciting for me, too, is that, like, I know

110
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,320
that Age of Calamity, the Zelda game, Hyrule Warriors, has come out.

111
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
Oh, it has.

112
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,480
And I haven't even, I haven't even touched it, or got it, I haven't even thought about

113
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
it.

114
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
You don't have time.

115
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
No.

116
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
And that's a nice feeling.

117
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Yeah.

118
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
To know that that's there.

119
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Yeah.

120
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
If I ever, uh, ever.

121
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
Sure.

122
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Because it may not ever happen.

123
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,480
You've got another 80 to 100 hours to put into balance.

124
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:47,200
If I ever finish with Valhalla, then, uh, you know, Age of Calamity is there waiting for

125
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,080
me, and that's a nice, comforting feeling.

126
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Yeah.

127
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,560
Anyway, I had second bright spot there.

128
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
Yeah, that is great!

129
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,480
So, Jordan, today, uh, we've got an interesting episode to go over, um, uh, Alex went out

130
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
of Georgia.

131
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
Alright.

132
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,880
Um, shout out to the, the couple people, uh, made audio versions of that.

133
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Yes, they did!

134
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,880
They did!

135
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
My parody song, which is.

136
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
This is very interesting.

137
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,040
This is a new level of fame for me, that, uh, I'm quite frankly uncomfortable with,

138
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
but I think is delightful.

139
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,480
You've reached a lot of people.

140
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,200
People have put, uh, put my parody song to music.

141
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,800
Honestly, I think a lot of people were expecting a sequel today.

142
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,040
Um, I don't know if, is there a sequel to The Devil One Time in Georgia?

143
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Uh, yeah.

144
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Not a Charlie Daniels version.

145
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
No, no, no.

146
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Well.

147
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
But there's a million different.

148
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,720
Well, in that case, mine was a sequel.

149
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
That's true.

150
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
That's true.

151
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Uh, no.

152
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
There is no sequel.

153
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,680
Uh, I figured, you know, can't force it.

154
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,600
Um, but Alex, uh, he went down to Georgia, and I, I will say that, uh, this experience

155
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,800
was not what I wanted it to be.

156
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,600
Um, it lacked a lot of the charm and the fun of the caravan.

157
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Sure.

158
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,120
Um, and that's because the caravan allowed me to paint a picture.

159
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Right.

160
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,080
Whereas, in this case, it's kind of Alex, the picture's painted.

161
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,580
You realize every time we get excited for something, we're talking about people who

162
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,800
turn every good thing into shit.

163
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,960
We're, we're, we're getting excited about the potential, um, that never gets realized.

165
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,040
We are the fucking Lucy, or no, we're Charlie Brown.

166
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,120
Every time they set up that football, and we're like, we're gonna fucking do it this

167
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
time.

168
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Yeah.

169
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
We're gonna kick it.

170
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
It's gonna be a caravan field goal.

171
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,320
It's gonna be amazing.

172
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,640
And then they slide it out from under us again and again and again.

173
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Yeah.

174
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
It's, it is unfortunate.

175
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,980
So, um, there's still some fun to be had along the way.

176
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,560
And I actually had a number of interesting, uh, things that I want to bring up and discuss

177
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,000
in the course of this.

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,200
Uh, we're just going to be talking about November 18th, 2020, um, Dan, this is 2020.

179
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Oh, hey.

180
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Oh, you're still alright with it.

181
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,360
I told you, we're still alright with it.

182
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
It's too late.

183
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
I've accepted it.

184
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,520
I also want to say that when I, uh, uh, discussed this on the last episode, I was actually stuck

185
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,040
in my craw a little bit.

186
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,520
I said that you were submitting to the bit, and I don't actually, that was not the right

187
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
choice of word.

188
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
I meant surrender.

189
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
Surrender is the word.

190
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
That was the word I was looking for.

191
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
Surrender is a good word.

192
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
It bothered me.

193
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,360
For like an entire day that I couldn't come up with that word.

194
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,720
You ever have something stuck in your craw?

195
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,040
I was laying in bed and I was like, I meant surrender, dammit.

196
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,940
Um, so, uh, the reason that we only have this one day is because, I mean, I think the trip

197
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,520
to Georgia is pretty unimpactful.

198
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:32,860
I think that it's, it's repetitive in nature, what Alex does when he's on the road.

199
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,600
And at the same time, there's enough stuff that happened during this episode that's worth

200
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,680
talking about that to try and force it and do like the whole rest of the week would have

201
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,000
ended up with like a six hour episode.

202
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,960
Still hasn't pulled a computer chip out of that homeless person.

203
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,200
Still has not.

204
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,360
We're on eight months of not pulling the computer chip out of somebody.

205
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,040
Yeah, I'd like to, there's so many running tallies.

206
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,000
How many days has it been since Rand Paul has refused your challenge to debate?

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,960
We're getting up to, uh, close to 150.

208
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:11,600
We are currently on day four of the scourge of, uh, gun toting Daleks running around the

209
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
streets.

210
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
We are in, like, there's a lot of tallies.

211
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,320
There's a lot of things to keep an eye on.

212
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Yeah.

213
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
But you know what I'd like to keep an eye on?

214
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
What's that, Dan?

215
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,840
Uh, my gratitude and our gratitude for the folks who have signed up and are supporting

216
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
the show.

217
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
I like it.

218
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,160
So first I'd like to give a shout out to Kayden, that's with a C. C-A-Y-D-E-N.

219
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
Thank you so much.

220
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
You are now a policy wonk.

221
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
I'm a policy wonk.

222
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Thanks, Kayden.

223
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Thank you.

224
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,440
Next, Joe the fourth with Roman initials, I-V.

225
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Thank you so much.

226
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,580
You're now a policy wonk.

227
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,580
I'm a policy wonk.

228
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,320
Thank you very much, Joe the IV-th.

229
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
Thank you.

230
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,760
Next, Da'Rin and that's D-A-R-I-N.

231
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,200
Uh, thank you so much.

232
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,520
You are now a policy wonk.

233
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,620
I'm a policy wonk.

234
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,620
Thanks, Da'Rin.

235
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,620
Thank you.

236
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,620
Next, Taylor D. Thank you so much.

237
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,760
You are now a policy wonk.

238
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
I'm a policy wonk.

239
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,080
Thank you very much, Taylor.

240
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Thank you.

241
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Next, Taylor Daines?

242
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,560
Uh, uhh, sure.

243
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
Ok.

244
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,160
Next, Zoe P. Thank you so much.

245
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,700
You are now a policy wonk.

246
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
I'm a policy wonk.

247
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
Thanks Zoe.

248
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,900
You ever get into a Zooey Zoey argument?

249
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,400
No.

250
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:06,900
Good.

251
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,400
Okay.

252
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Next, this fella asked me to say how I thought his last name was pronounced.

253
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,900
Okay.

254
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,200
And I know that this was just because it looks like Wiener.

255
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,700
Sure.

256
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,000
But I knew it was Wiener.

257
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,500
Sure.

258
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,700
Maybe, maybe...

259
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,600
Sometimes it's Wiener.

260
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,100
I think it's rarely.

261
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,400
I mean like Matt Weiner, isn't he the guy who made Mad Men?

262
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,900
Sure.

263
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,800
Isn't that Matt?

264
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,300
Yeah.

265
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,400
I might have the first name wrong.

266
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

267
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,600
Something like that.

268
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,200
Yeah.

269
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,700
Yeah.

270
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,300
So anyway, Jason, thank you so much.

271
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,900
You are now a policy wonk.

272
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,800
I'm a policy wonk.

273
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,500
Thanks, Jason.

274
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
You ever get into a Wiener Weiner argument, Dan?

275
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes.

276
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,600
That one I have.

277
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,100
Next, Quasar the Corgi Star.

278
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,700
Thank you so much.

279
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,000
You are now a policy wonk.

280
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
I'm a policy wonk.

281
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,600
Thanks.

282
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,700
Cue the CS.

283
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,700
And finally, I'd like to thank you to a couple people who donated on an elevated level from abroad.

284
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,900
Ooh.

285
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,100
So first, Jan from Denmark.

286
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,700
Thank you so much.

287
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,400
You are now a technocrat.

288
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,800
And Mirjum from...

289
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,500
This is a name that I'm not going to be able to handle.

290
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,900
You're going to do this.

291
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,500
Hammond Lina.

292
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,300
Thank you so much.

293
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,000
You are now a technocrat.

294
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
I'm a policy wonk.

295
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,000
Crikey, mate.

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That's fantastic.

297
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,300
Have yourself a brew.

298
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,900
How's your 401k doing, bro?

299
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,600
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

300
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,800
Let's just get down to business.

301
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,900
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

302
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,600
Why you pimps so good?

303
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
My neck is freakishly large.

304
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,100
I declare info war on you.

305
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:36,600
Thank you so much to our representatives from Denmark and Hammond Lina.

306
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:36,900
Yes.

307
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,300
Thank you very much to the both of you.

308
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,800
I look forward to your correction about the pronunciation.

309
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,400
It'll be great.

310
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,700
Yeah.

311
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,000
It's pronounced quokka.

312
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,500
Probably.

313
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:43,800
Yeah.

314
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,100
So if you're out there listening and thinking, hey, I enjoy the show.

315
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,000
I'd like to support these giants.

316
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,800
You can do that by going to our website, pressing that button that says support the show or...

317
00:12:50,800 --> 00:13:00,000
If you are experiencing any kind of malaise or perhaps existential crisis, what you should do is fill yourself with a generous spirit.

318
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Channel that chi energy all the way up into your fist and punch a local charity or bail fund, but metaphorically and with generosity.

319
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,400
All right.

320
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:09,900
That works.

321
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:15,800
So Jordan, this is the reverse of the caravan.

322
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,400
Mm hmm.

323
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,700
This is and I don't know why I didn't see the Navarock.

324
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,300
I don't know why I didn't see this in advance.

325
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,600
I'm so blind.

326
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,900
I'm so blind to like what's actually going to happen.

327
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,500
Sure.

328
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,000
Because like Alex going down to Georgia, it's like, this is exciting.

329
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:48,500
Alex is going to be rampaging it, but I forgot that that means that Owen is going to be hosting the show and like, I forgot that like, oh, it's the flip of the dynamic from the caravan where Owen's out on the road and Alex is, you know, throwing to him in the field.

330
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:55,200
Now we've got, God, I was just like, as soon as you get into it, you're like, oh no.

331
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,700
How does, how does Owen try and really pull off three hours?

332
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:07,200
Well, one of the ways he does it is he mostly plays a live feed of Alex and Ali Alexander yelling in Atlanta on this episode.

333
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,600
That's smart.

334
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,000
There's a lot of that.

335
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,300
Yeah.

336
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,800
So thankfully there's that.

337
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,200
Sure.

338
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,000
And I will say I appreciate it.

339
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,700
And the episode starts with Alex doing a little bit of a message.

340
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,000
This is the mark of the beast out of Revelation.

341
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,900
It's not coming.

342
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,800
It's here.

343
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,600
And so many of the big Baptist churches and Catholic churches are putting in the QR codes and doing all the same thing because they're not churches.

344
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,000
They've been taken over by this system.

345
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,400
So it's going to all get rapidly worse very, very quickly.

346
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,400
So Alex has got some fear of QR codes.

347
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:41,400
She wants everyone to have, I don't know what he thinks QR codes are the thing that's been around for 15 years.

348
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,600
It's been around for a while.

349
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:49,100
And in the real world, they're just an advancement of the same idea behind a barcode, which is used by many retail outlets.

350
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:55,500
I say many because if you don't want to use barcodes and UPC scanners to ring up products, you don't have to.

351
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,200
No, you do.

352
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,000
It's compelled by the mark of the beast.

353
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,800
You don't have to.

354
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,000
No, it's compelled by the mark of the beast.

355
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,600
It's just efficient.

356
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,900
The main reason I pulled this clip was to illustrate how deep into the nonsense Alex is to start this show off.

357
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:19,000
The second reason I included this clip is probably more important and it's to use this as an opportunity to explain how people like Alex are broken records trying to make everyone afraid of everything for no reason.

358
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:31,300
QR codes are something that Alex is trying to scare his audience about, and interestingly, if you look into the history of the thing that preceded QR codes, the UPC barcode, you'll find hysterical people doing the exact same thing 50 years ago.

359
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,900
According to an article about UPC history in Wired, quote,

360
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:48,900
when the first UPC scanners arrived in the early 1970s, according to various IBMers who worked on the project, there were protests at grocery stores even though the codes appeared on coke cans and jars of applesauce, not right hands and foreheads.

361
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,400
I love Christianity.

362
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:57,900
And in the year that followed, an urban legend arose, warning gullible types that the number 666 was hidden in each barcode.

363
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:04,400
Some of these paranoid types noted that there were often sixes in the barcode, which were in fact arbitrary, but it doesn't matter.

364
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,900
Again, from the article, quote,

365
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:17,900
Early test films of the scanners were labeled with the letters F, G, and H, and some saw this as proof that the code would wind up on more than just coke cans, assisting the H stood for head and the F for forearm.

366
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,400
Sure.

367
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,400
People do this, it's inevitable, because change and the future are both scary things.

368
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:30,900
The more complex a system is, the greater possibility it has in terms of productivity and effectiveness and ability to help people live better lives,

369
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,900
but as that complexity increases, the theoretical damage that it could cause go up too.

370
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,900
A simple example is just the internet.

371
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:47,900
The ability for people to communicate and digitally interact over great distances, it's revolutionary in terms of information flow and directing charitable assistance to places that need it,

372
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,900
but it's created a gigantic tinderbox that could explode at any time.

373
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,900
For instance, back in 2013, the Associated Press's Twitter account got hacked,

374
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:02,900
and a fake tweet was posted about two explosions going off at the White House that had injured President Obama.

375
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:14,900
This wasn't true, but the effect on the stock market was real, and it's the byproduct of a volatility that would not exist without the ability for information to travel exceedingly fast.

376
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,900
Almost every technology you can imagine can be slotted into this kind of balance.

377
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:24,900
Having a centralized power company in your town relieves you of the burden of having to run a generator yourself,

378
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,900
but also, if there's a bad storm in your area, your whole block might end up losing power for a while.

379
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:36,900
The complexity of emerging technologies provides benefits, but also increases the problems when something goes wrong.

380
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:47,900
Alex is just one in a long, long chain of hysterical idiots yelling about how some new-ish, not even that new, new-ish, invention is the end of the world.

381
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,900
He's rambling about QR codes just like his forefathers, who protested barcodes outside grocery stores.

382
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:59,900
It's a real bummer that John of Patmos really maligned a more efficient system.

383
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,900
Like, maybe if Satan were less of a—like, God is kind of a Luddite in this scenario, right?

384
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,900
So the Antichrist is like, hey, let's give everybody a mark so we can do the whole thing.

385
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,900
You can do commerce, you can do all this stuff.

386
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,900
Yeah, I get that that can be abused, but it's still a more efficient system, all right?

387
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
God is out here like, let's give everybody free will.

388
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,900
Fuck that noise. That gets everybody complicated.

389
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,900
See what we're talking about with Twitter? People are jumping out there, lying, ruining the stock market in two seconds.

390
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,900
Put the mark of the beast on everybody, forehead, call it a day.

391
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,900
All right.

392
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
Yeah, that's my plan.

393
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:40,900
I lost myself entirely in that speech. I was like, all right, yeah, let's do that.

394
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,900
You have a hypnotic power today, Jordan. I'm worried about it.

395
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:54,900
So Alex is on the scene in Atlanta with Ali, and the beginning of the show is what appears to be a pre-recorded—

396
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,900
or it could have been live, I'm not entirely sure—thing of them just sort of yelling about this stuff.

397
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
Yeah, yeah.

398
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,900
And Ali has some big news to break down.

399
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,900
This is just one example of dozens that have already come out in the last day. This is just now breaking in Georgia, where we are.

400
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Just this morning, it is breaking news. David Shafer, the Georgia Republican Party chair, tweets this.

401
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:22,900
One of our monitors discovered 9,626 vote error in DeKalb County hand count. That is in Atlanta.

402
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:31,900
One batch was labeled 10,707 votes for Biden and just 13 for Trump, an improbable margin even for DeKalb standards.

403
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:38,900
The actual count for the batch was 1,081 for Biden and 13 for Trump.

404
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:48,900
Had this counting error not been discovered, Biden would have gained enough votes from this one batch alone to cancel out Trump's gains from Fayette County, Floyd, and Walton.

405
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:55,900
Folks, we have to audit the vote, and we have to check the signatures in Georgia. That's why Alex Jones and I are here.

406
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:01,900
So Ali is reporting based on a tweet that was posted by David Shafer, the head of the GOP in Georgia.

407
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:10,900
But it's a very misleading tweet designed to be used by bad faith actors like Alex and Ali to fuel their machines that they're trying to use to overturn this election.

408
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,900
Naturally.

409
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:18,900
Basically what happened was this. They're conducting this recount in Georgia, and during the recount someone made a recording error.

410
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:27,900
That is to say that they mistakenly put down over 10,000 votes for Biden and 13 for Trump, when in reality the total was just over 1,000 for Biden and 13 for Trump.

411
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,900
This mistake was caught in the recount, and that's what Shafer is yelling about.

412
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,900
Sure.

413
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:39,900
This counting error was not made in the initial automated count of the ballots, only in the recount, so it does not actually affect the totals for the state at all.

414
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,900
But that's the impression that Shafer's tweet and Alex's coverage are designed to leave the audience with.

415
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,900
Sure.

416
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:56,900
The idea is supposed to be that their sleuths uncovered 9,000 votes from the actual election for Biden that were erroneous, when in reality someone involved with the recount made a mistake and the process caught it before it actually was a big mistake.

417
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,900
Yeah, that'll happen.

418
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:08,900
The DeKalb County CEO released a statement that basically said that they were unable to verify the claims of this error, but to put it in my words, even if everything Shafer said is true, it doesn't matter.

419
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:14,900
Quote, based on Chairman Shafer's Twitter storm, I was a little surprised by the tone of this statement.

420
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,900
Chairman Shafer, okay.

421
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,900
No, I was more about the Twitter storm part.

422
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

423
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:31,900
Based on Chairman Shafer's Twitter storm, the alleged vote error was discovered, reported to DeKalb elections officials, and corrected prior to the transmission of the official audit report to the Georgia Secretary of State's office.

424
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:43,900
If the scenario occurred, as Chairman Shafer alleges, this is evidence that the checks and balances established by Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ensure the accuracy of the election results performed as designed.

425
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:50,900
As is always the case with Alex and Allie, this is a dud, but it's a dud that they're probably going to use as a piece of evidence of fraud.

426
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,900
Sure, forever.

427
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,900
Yep.

428
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
And it's not just Georgia, baby!

429
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,900
It's not!

430
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:03,900
Somebody during the recount accidentally put an extra zero, and then they found it, and now it's all over.

431
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,900
More or less.

432
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,900
Yeah.

433
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,900
Yeah.

434
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,900
Yeah.

435
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,900
Okay, cool.

436
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
But it's not just Georgia.

437
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,900
Thanks, America.

438
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,900
It's also Michigan.

439
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,900
Sure.

440
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:18,900
So breaking news, Allie, on the situation that is just explosive, like out of a Hollywood gangster movie in Michigan.

441
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,900
Tell us about that.

442
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:27,900
So in Wayne County, Michigan, that's Detroit, the Republicans, two Republicans and two Democrats sit on the canvassing board.

443
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:41,900
The Republicans decided not to certify the election, but under duress and threat from hundreds of thousands of tweets, the leftist Antifa, BLM, they reluctantly agreed under the condition that the Secretary of State would do an audit.

444
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:48,900
We are in legal and constitutional limbo as we don't even understand what that means, what are their rights.

445
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,900
No, you don't understand what that means.

446
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:56,900
So we have this bullying from the left against people who just want to certify clean elections, not bad elections.

447
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,900
What Allie is saying is inaccurate, but let's pretend for a moment what he's saying is true.

448
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:08,900
That would mean that the Republicans on this council he's talking about were willing to certify an election that they felt was fraudulent because people were mean to them on Twitter.

449
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
Yep.

450
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:16,900
I'm sorry, Allie is saying that like it's an understandable thing, like the leftists are just too mean on Twitter, they had to certify the results.

451
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,900
Well, when you say mean things, that's how the American Revolution started.

452
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Sure, there was the taxation thing, but George was like, these guys are a bunch of dicks, and they were like, well, we got to tear this place down.

453
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:33,900
Yeah, I mean, it's like in the Declaration of Independence, cyberbullying comes up a lot.

454
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,900
How dare you write letters to us?

455
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:43,900
Allie is saying, like the people tweeting stuff, this mean stuff, it's like the equivalent of having a gun to your head, which is ridiculous.

456
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:54,900
If it's your job to make sure the election is fair, and your decision-making process is in any way affected by what someone on Twitter says, you've proven exactly one thing, and that is that you're not qualified for your position.

457
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,900
Yeah.

458
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,900
The Wayne County Board of Canvassers met to certify the election results, and things broke down on a party line.

459
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:07,900
With the two Republicans, William Hartman and Monica Palmer, voting against certification, and the Democrats voting for certification.

460
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:13,900
At issue was the number, there was a number of precincts that had an unexplained discrepancy in vote totals.

461
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:19,900
According to the Detroit Free Press, quote, most of them recorded discrepancies of three votes or fewer.

462
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:26,900
In 2016, there were similar discrepancies in voter totals, and Jill Stein's campaign had pushed for a recount.

463
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:32,900
This recount was ended by a court order before it could be completed, but after the election was over, the state of Michigan did do an audit,

464
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:38,900
and it found that a vast majority of the unexplained discrepancies were easily explainable by human error,

465
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:49,900
and that, quote, many of the problems encountered in Detroit are attributable to a lack of proficiency using EPB software, or the mishandling of provisional envelope ballots.

466
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:57,900
They found in their audit that votes were accurately counted, but that there were mistakes made in terms of being able to correctly match each vote with its ballot,

467
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
because of these various human errors.

468
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:06,900
It's incredibly likely, almost to a point of certainty, that this same phenomenon is present here in the 2020 election.

469
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:13,900
Ultimately, Palmer and Hartman agreed to certify the Wayne County results when the Democrats on the board agreed to do an audit of the votes,

470
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:20,900
but apparently, Palmer and Hartman didn't realize that the audit would be literally impossible to do prior to the certification of the election,

471
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:26,900
and so they tried to recant their certification, which is something they can't do, so that's where things stand right now.

472
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,900
Oh, you know, you can recant a certification after an election. That's how it always works, Dan.

473
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:39,900
The cynical-minded fellow out there might think that the real reason that Palmer and Hartman decided to recant their decision to certify is that Trump called them personally, but what do I know?

474
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,900
Oh, that'd be crazy.

475
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:50,900
Now, Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chair, is calling for Michigan to adjourn their board for 14 days to get to the bottom of these very serious, or possibly wildly overblown, issues.

476
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:59,900
At the point of us recording this episode, we don't know how this is gonna shake out, because the board in Michigan is set to certify on Monday, which is in the future from us right now.

477
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,900
Great.

478
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:08,900
All signs appear to indicate that, like Georgia, they will certify the results, but this world is fucking insane, so I am not going to take anything for granted.

479
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,900
Yeah, come on, why not?

480
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,900
But the reality is that there were precincts-

481
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,900
Let's get a nice Andrew Johnson in there to help take us over.

482
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,900
Couldn't hurt. Could hurt, could hurt, could hurt.

483
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,900
What's the wrong with it? No, no, no, no, no. Whenever there's a fraudulent election, you want an Andrew Johnson to come back in there.

484
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:31,900
Well, there were issues of voting discrepancies that are, to an extent, normal.

485
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,900
Sure.

486
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,900
And that is something that's being weaponized by Ali, and one of the ways that he's doing it is just outright lying.

487
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:46,900
They're still calling for an audit, but they did go ahead and say they're going to certify it, because things were, quote, out of balance at a record level.

488
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,900
So they're out of balance at a record level. I think it was double from 2016 to now.

489
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,900
That's just categorically not true.

490
00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:03,900
Alex and Ali are making this stuff up, knowing that no one in their audience will question them or go consult the 2016 audit, which I would bet anything I own that even these two dudes don't know exists.

491
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,900
It'd be really hard to find. You'd have to Google it.

492
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,900
It's not hard.

493
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,900
And then you'd read it.

494
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
That part might be hard for them.

495
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,900
Have you read things before? That's hard.

496
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:29,900
The Detroit Free Press said this of the unexplained discrepancies in Wayne County in the 2020 election, quote, of Detroit's 503 election day precincts, 85 recorded unexplained discrepancies in the vote totals, as did 94 of the city's 134 absentee voting counting boards.

497
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,900
Most of them recorded discrepancies of three votes or fewer.

498
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:49,900
If you consult the 2016 election audit conducted by the Michigan Department of State, you'll find that, quote, the Wayne County Board of Canvassers reported during the post-election canvas period that concluded November 22, 2016, approximately 392 precincts appeared to be out of balance.

499
00:27:49,900 --> 00:28:00,900
If you combine the in-person and absentee counting boards from 2020, you have a decrease of 213 out of balance precincts in this election compared to four years ago, not double.

500
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,900
Sure, sure, but that's by 10,000 each time.

501
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,900
Sure.

502
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,900
Every single one of those is an accidental adding of 1,000.

503
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,900
No.

504
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:19,900
And these numbers probably sound high, and they kind of are, but these are almost entirely indicative of minor human errors that do not actually affect vote counts.

505
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,900
But they do lead to accounting problems.

506
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:34,900
For instance, the audit report discusses the case in 2016 of Precinct 152, where the sealed ballot container, it only had 50 votes in it at the end of the night, but the rules indicated that 306 votes had been cast.

507
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:41,900
This was because poll workers had accidentally left the rest of the ballots in the tabulator and failed to put them then into the sealed container.

508
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,900
Sure.

509
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:48,900
It's a problem, and it will lead to a discrepancy, but it doesn't actually have any bearing on the vote tallies or mean there was any fraud.

510
00:28:48,900 --> 00:29:02,900
Most problems that you will hear people like Alex yell about fall into this category, and I would be willing to venture a guess that in a few months, whenever there is an audit of this election, which Alex will ignore by that point, you'll find a lot of similar human error issues.

511
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,900
Sure.

512
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:17,900
I mean, have you ever counted to 1,000 and then counted to 1,000 with two people over your shoulder, six feet away from you, going like, no, that's one more for the other team.

513
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,900
Like, of course you're going to get three wrong.

514
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:27,900
I mean, look, in Mario Party 6, I think, there was a little mini-game where you had to remember the order of fruits.

515
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,900
Yeah.

516
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,900
Yeah?

517
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,900
You had to remember four fruits, usually.

518
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,900
And sometimes my friends got it wrong.

519
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,900
Of course.

520
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,900
Well, I mean, granted, we were high as hell when we would play it, but still.

521
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,900
Sure.

522
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:47,900
One time, my buddy Swearengen, it was a bundle of grapes was the thing he had to remember.

523
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,900
I think it was grapes, and he pluralized it, and he got it wrong.

524
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,900
You went off on it.

525
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,900
No, he got it wrong.

526
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,900
Oh, that's right, because the game does it for you.

527
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,900
Yeah, because it was the voice.

528
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,900
It wasn't like a Scattergories argument that everybody got into.

529
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:10,900
It was that weird period where the, I think it was the GameCube, had a microphone that you could have, like, a couple voice commands.

530
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,900
It would recognize, so you'd be like, banana, grape.

531
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,900
Sure.

532
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,900
And he got it wrong even though he had the right...

533
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,900
Because he said grapes.

534
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,900
I think so, yeah.

535
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,900
Lives on in my memory.

536
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,900
Forever.

537
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,900
Anyway, yeah, my point is that people can make mistakes.

538
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,900
People make mistakes.

539
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:32,900
The larger point here, though, is that Ali and Alex are completely wrong and absolutely just making up that there's record levels of precincts being out of balance.

540
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,900
They have no idea what they're talking about, and the actual numbers are the exact opposite of their narrative.

541
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:46,900
There wasn't record discrepancy, and if you go by the strict numbers, there was a 54% decrease in precincts reporting unexplained discrepancies this election cycle.

542
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,900
Seems like progress.

543
00:30:48,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Yeah, that would make sense considering for the, like, three months up to the election everybody was constantly screaming about how there's no possible way that this would be a fair-counted election, so everybody went so fucking overboard.

544
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:10,900
Well, and because of those discrepancies that happened in the 2016 election, there were probably a lot of conversations about little things that could be done to limit...

545
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:21,900
Well, I think that, I mean, obviously you'd like to see that number even lower, but that much of a decrease from one presidential election to another seems, like, pretty good.

546
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,900
I don't know.

547
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:31,900
I mean, let's say we've got, what is it, almost 150 million votes cast, or over 160 million now? Something along those lines.

548
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:43,900
And we have, what, it's 50% of the counties in Michigan in 2016 reported fewer than three, three or fewer.

549
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,900
Like, that's a vote tally of discrepancy less than a thousand.

550
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,900
In Michigan, that's ridiculously...

551
00:31:52,900 --> 00:32:00,900
Yeah, and reading over this audit, they were discussing that, like, the really bad ones are ones that had over three.

552
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,900
Yeah.

553
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:07,900
And that, you know, it leads you to recognize that these ones that are out of balance aren't out of balance by, like, a thousand.

554
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,900
No.

555
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,900
That would be egregious.

556
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

557
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,900
That would be, like, national alarms going off.

558
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,900
Totally. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

559
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,900
Yeah, it's severe when there's three or four votes that are...

560
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,900
Somebody added a zero, and it's a story for months now, you know?

561
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:25,900
Well, yeah, and it was, you know, in a recount, and it got caught before anything...

562
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,900
Sure, sure.

563
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,900
Before it had any impact on anything.

564
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,900
Totally.

565
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:36,900
So, anyway, these are kind of the big sort of election fraud narratives that they got, and both are just like, oh, here's the real story.

566
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:42,900
I understand where your lies are coming from and the spin you're putting on, but it's just... it's flimsy.

567
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,900
As is this.

568
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,900
Ali has some things he wants to complain about.

569
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,900
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

570
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:56,900
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in a 5-2 decision said it doesn't matter that there were no Republicans in some of these polling locations.

571
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,900
It's fine.

572
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,900
That is not true.

573
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,900
Well, that sounds true.

574
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,900
Here's what's going on here.

575
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:12,900
Trump's legal team had argued that their poll watchers in Pennsylvania were not allowed close enough access to voters, vote counters, excuse me, in the Philadelphia Convention Center.

576
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:23,900
Because of many factors, perhaps most importantly COVID-19-related social distancing, the poll watchers were kept behind a barrier approximately 15 to 18 feet away from the first row of canvassers.

577
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:28,900
So the workers would have a safe area to come and go as needed, like they had to go to the bathroom or whatever.

578
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:35,900
The Trump campaign argued that this was not appropriate, and a lower judge reached a compromise where they could set the barrier at six feet.

579
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:44,900
Then Trump's campaign filed a lawsuit claiming that the votes that were counted before the barrier were moved were, uh, they shouldn't count since the watchers didn't have appropriate access.

580
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:58,900
The matter reached the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, who ruled that the initial distance was appropriate for the requirements in the election code, and to mandate that the distance was too great would be the state encroaching on the county's right to run its election through the Philadelphia County Board of Elections.

581
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,900
That does sound right.

582
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,900
Yep.

583
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,900
They vacated any previous order and denied the Trump campaign their requests.

584
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,900
Oh, that's fair.

585
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,900
This is not what Ali is reporting.

586
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,900
No.

587
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:14,900
The Supreme Court decided that it was fine that the Republicans had no poll watchers, which is not at all the issue that was before the court.

588
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
He's lying about it because it sounds better for his side.

589
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,900
Sounds way better.

590
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,900
Yeah, because he's a liar.

591
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

592
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:25,900
This same strategy has been employed by Trump's legal team, including noted weirdo Jenna Ellis, who said, quote,

593
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:33,900
It's inexplicable that five justices on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would conclude that watchers observing from distances up to 100 feet away is reasonable.

594
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,900
And then she pulled out her slide whistle and went, boop!

595
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,900
No, downward.

596
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,900
Boop!

597
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,900
Boop!

598
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,900
Yeah.

599
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,900
Okay.

600
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,900
There is no evidence that this is the case at all.

601
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,900
In fact, the only reference to 100 feet in the court decision is, quote,

602
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:53,900
The campaign contends that the board set up imposing a barrier and having some tables in the area over 100 feet away from the edge of the security fence,

603
00:34:53,900 --> 00:35:06,900
effectively deprived its representative of the ability to be truly present and effectively eliminates the representative's ability to perform his or her role of ensuring openness and transparency in the electoral process.

604
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,900
That idea only exists as a thing that the Trump legal team claimed but isn't substantiated.

605
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:20,900
I like that the Trump legal team could just be like, yeah, we're claiming that 30 different drone bombs killed all the Republican in the United States, and nobody is talking about that.

606
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,900
Nobody's talking.

607
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:27,900
And the Pennsylvania Supreme Court isn't even going to certify that the election was stolen since all Republicans are dead now.

608
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,900
Sure.

609
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:34,900
If you look at the findings of the suit, you can find out what the maximum distance from a person the watchers would be.

610
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:41,900
There was a 15 to 18 foot divide between the watchers and the first row of tables, then from the suit, quote,

611
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:49,900
A designated area of the convention center was divided into discrete sections, each devoted to various aspects of the pre-canvassing and canvassing process.

612
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:55,900
Each section contained three rows of folding tables, each table separated by five to six feet.

613
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:03,900
Even if you assume that, like, each table takes up six feet on its own and you use the high end of 18 feet for the initial barrier,

614
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,900
you still end up only with a distance of 54 feet from the barrier to the furthest table.

615
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,900
But of course, you know, also people could observe from different angles.

616
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,900
Sure.

617
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,900
Anyway, my point here is that you can easily see how talking points get created out of this.

618
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,900
For someone like Jenna Ellis, she can claim in a suit that people are 100 feet away, and then when the suit gets thrown out,

619
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:27,900
she can claim that the court determined that people 100 feet away is totally fine, and that's not necessarily accurate.

620
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,900
No, they can make any claim they want.

621
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,900
But this is how you can spin this case rightly being rejected.

622
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,900
Yeah.

623
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,900
And as for someone like Allie, you know, he doesn't have to worry about things like getting disbarred or anything,

624
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,900
so he's free to just make up anything.

625
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,900
Yeah, why not?

626
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,900
Which is what he's doing.

627
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,900
Yeah, go for it.

628
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,900
It's great.

629
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:51,900
Well, there's just no way, I'm blown away that at no point in time do any of these courts just be like,

630
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,900
we're holding you in contempt for this dumb argument.

631
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,900
One time, hold them, it's pathetic. It's pathetic.

632
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:06,900
It's a shameful thing to be a, I can't imagine being a judge reading one of these things and being like,

633
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,900
my job is valuable. How could you possibly think that?

634
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,900
I mean, you see how long it took to like disbar Larry Klayman, though.

635
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,900
Exactly.

636
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,900
Or like get him suspended.

637
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,900
They'll do anything to avoid telling each other that they're doing a bad job.

638
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,900
It does seem that way.

639
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,900
Yeah.

640
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:28,900
So there's a plan in Georgia, and it's not a fiddle contest, but Allie has this plan that he's going to lay out.

641
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,900
Alright.

642
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,900
He's one of these guys who really likes, I think he fancies himself a Bond villain.

643
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,900
Sure.

644
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,900
He really likes to lay out his plan.

645
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,900
Okay.

646
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,900
We're in Georgia, tell folks about what we're doing the next four days in a row at high noon.

647
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:48,900
So at high noon at the Georgia State Capitol, Alex Jones, myself and other patriots are here,

648
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,900
and we are marching and we are telling the Secretary of State, stop, don't certify.

649
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,900
The chances of that happening are zero.

650
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,900
But we might stop the deadline that happens 24 hours after that, and that's when Governor Brian Kemp,

651
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,900
who's been wobbly on this whole issue, then has to certify the election from his office.

652
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,900
So...

653
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,900
MWAHAHAHA!

654
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,900
That was less nefarious than some of the other times, but like he's being a little blunt.

655
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,900
I kind of appreciate that.

656
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,900
There's no chance we're going to achieve this goal.

657
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:23,900
We're going to fail, but maybe we won't fail later, even though it seems like planning to fail from the beginning

658
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,900
would suggest that we are going to continue to fail.

659
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,900
Listen, every day at noon we're going to be marching for something that is not going to work.

660
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,900
And then, maybe after that, the Governor will do some...

661
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,900
And by the way, Kemp did certify.

662
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Yeah, well, of course.

663
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,900
That also had a zero percent chance of working.

664
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,900
You fucking larping pieces.

665
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,900
We're going to high noon! Get the fuck out of here.

666
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,900
Get a job.

667
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,900
Guns blazing.

668
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,900
Get a fucking job.

669
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,900
He has a job. This is it.

670
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,900
Yeah, well, get a different one.

671
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:01,900
Well, he might have to, because even Ali recognizes here that if Brian Kemp, if he certifies...

672
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,900
If even Brian Kemp isn't on our team...

673
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,900
We might be fucked.

674
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,900
We're fucked.

675
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:12,900
When he signs a piece of paper certifying the election, it puts a Democrat slate of electors to the Electoral College.

676
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,900
We cannot have this happen.

677
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,900
If this happens, our remedies in court then become next to nil.

678
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,900
Well, that's where we are now. You've lost Georgia.

679
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,900
Move along.

680
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,900
Let's get Alex to Philadelphia or something.

681
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,900
Let's get him in a fight with Grady.

682
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,900
Yeah.

683
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,900
These fucking guys.

684
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,900
I wonder what the next state will be.

685
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,900
Alex went to Arizona.

686
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,900
He went to Georgia.

687
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
This isn't going to work in Georgia.

688
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,900
What's next? What's the next state?

689
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,900
I don't know.

690
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,900
With the weakness of all of these legal challenges...

691
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,900
They're not going to get less desperate.

692
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,900
These are already incredibly pathetic.

693
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,900
What happens when all of these fail?

694
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,900
They have to do something and it's going to be even more desperate than what it is now.

695
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,900
I think it's got to be go to D.C. again or something.

696
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,900
Yeah, it's got to be something like that.

697
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:10,900
Or maybe Lexington and Concord, because you know how much they love the Revolutionary War stuff.

698
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,900
So maybe try and recreate that. Go down to Boston or something.

699
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,900
I'm waiting for them to be like, okay, we're going to head to South Carolina.

700
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,900
There's a couple forts around.

701
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,900
Oh boy.

702
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,900
We'll just see what happens.

703
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,900
I got a crazy idea. Alex is going to occupy the Alamo.

704
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,900
I don't think that's a bad idea.

705
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,900
This is my destiny.

706
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,900
Leave him there.

707
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,900
Sir, we have a group of tourists coming through. We're going to need you to leave.

708
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,900
I'm part of the exhibit now. I am Colonel Travis.

709
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,900
That would be great.

710
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,900
That would be great.

711
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,900
Late career change for Alex. Living museum display.

712
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,900
Instead of going around with his Mark Twain show, he's just like, I am Colonel Travis.

713
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,900
Yeah, he could just drink.

714
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,900
I think it would be great.

715
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:01,900
So now we get to Owen helming the show in studio.

716
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,900
He's sort of just giving a little talk over the footage.

717
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:10,900
He gets surprised by a little someone he sees hanging out with Alex.

718
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,900
And Alex Jones is right there on the screen.

719
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:19,900
Bullhorning the state capitol building in Atlanta, Georgia.

720
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,900
I think that's Nick Fuentes to his left.

721
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,900
Rob Dew there on screen as well filming.

722
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,900
Yeah, Nick Fuentes is hanging out with Alex down in Georgia.

723
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,900
There's Alex Jones and a Nazi standing next to him.

724
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,900
So I think we're doing great.

725
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,900
Having a great time.

726
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,900
I think we're doing great.

727
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,900
So Owen is just throwing to this video as much as he can.

728
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,900
Sure.

729
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,900
The globalists have been caught red-handed, engaged in massive fraud.

730
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,900
And the people know.

731
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,900
And the people will not accept this fraudulent election.

732
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,900
And just like in other countries, they're none of them.

733
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:02,900
We need a new election call in the disputed states.

734
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,900
Wild.

735
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,900
Stop the steal. Stop the steal.

736
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,900
Ah yes, such a great constitutional plan.

737
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,900
Ah.

738
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,900
It's called for new elections in the states that your hero lost.

739
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,900
This is really stupid, but for the first time in a long time, Alex makes sense.

740
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,900
He's back to being in an opposition role to the rest of reality, which is where he belongs.

741
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,900
Yeah.

742
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,900
It feels...

743
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,900
Yeah, yeah, I...

744
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,900
They just know they want fascism.

745
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,900
Well, they've kind of had to be blunt about it now.

746
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:39,900
They can't, like with the election results in Michigan, like, okay, okay.

747
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,900
I get you.

748
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,900
What if we just throw out all black votes?

749
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,900
How about that? Does that count?

750
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,900
Would we still have an election there?

751
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,900
Is that still good?

752
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,900
But Alex seems right out on the street.

753
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,900
Yeah.

754
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,900
More what I'm talking about.

755
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,900
You know what I'm saying?

756
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,900
No, no, no. He's home.

757
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,900
Yeah.

758
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,900
He's home again.

759
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,900
I compare things to wrestling a lot, but that's because there's a lot of similarity to the

760
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,900
distorted reality that exists on Infowars and in the WWE.

761
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,900
To get really basic with things, there are good guys and bad guys in wrestling.

762
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,900
The good guy is the face, the bad guy is the heel.

763
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,900
The ultimate goal of a feud is to have the bad guy anger the audience,

764
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,900
whether it be by cheating in matches or having a shitty personality or whatever,

765
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,900
to the point where the audience wants to pay to see the face kick his ass.

766
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,900
There are variations in some middle grounds, but this is the basic dynamic.

767
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,900
There are character types that only work as a heel or a face,

768
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,900
and trying to make them work in an opposite alignment does not play.

769
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,900
A cocky showboat who thinks they're too hot works as a heel but not as a face,

770
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,900
because the things that they have to do to play their character are inherently annoying.

771
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,900
The exception to this would be Shawn Michaels, but he was a once-in-a-generation talent

772
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,900
and rules don't apply to people like him or Stone Cold or The Undertaker.

773
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,900
I gotcha. It's fine. We can move on from that.

774
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:59,900
Similarly, the scrappy tryhard wrestler who refuses to quit does not work as a heel.

775
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,900
The audience watching a person take a horrible beating and still kicking out of pins

776
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,900
makes them cheer for the underdog who won't give up.

777
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,900
The giant they're fighting has thrown everything they have against them and they just won't stay down.

778
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,900
People love that shit, to the point where it's such a powerful thing

779
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:20,900
that it was used to turn Stone Cold's face in his match against Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13.

780
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,900
Bret went into that match as the face, and the two had a brutal match

781
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,900
that resulted in Bret getting Stone Cold into his submission hold, the Sharpshooter.

782
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,900
Stone Cold was bleeding profusely from the face, and he refused to tap out to the Sharpshooter,

783
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,900
with Bret ending up winning when Stone Cold passed out in the hold.

784
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,900
It left an iconic image, and that performance, where he refused to give in,

785
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,900
made it impossible for crowds not to cheer for Stone Cold, and thus he had to be a face.

786
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,900
Consider that previous to this his gimmick had been that he was a homicidal redneck

787
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:55,900
that was inspired by the emotionless serial killer Richard Kuklinski, aka the Iceman.

788
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:00,900
Who among us has not turned face after being like, I like serial killers?

789
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,900
Less than a year prior, he'd broken his former tag team partner Brian Pillman's ankle,

790
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,900
and then was trying to invade his home to continue attacking him,

791
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,900
which led to Pillman pulling out a gun on television to protect himself,

792
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,900
which was super fucked up and really scared people at the time,

793
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,900
because, well, the feed cut out right as Pillman was pulling his gun.

794
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:21,900
Okay, well that's not good.

795
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,900
No, and Stone Cold was rushing into the house.

796
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,900
That's not good.

797
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,900
Anyway, the point here is that there are characterizations that only work in certain contexts,

798
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,900
and Alex Jones only works outside any connection to power.

799
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:37,900
Everything becomes incoherent once he's trying to make excuses for the president who he supports,

800
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,900
but everything is still a conspiracy, just a conspiracy that doesn't involve the president,

801
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,900
and everyone who blindly supports said president.

802
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,900
It's nonsensical, like trying to boo a wrestler who has too much heart to give up.

803
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,900
It doesn't make sense.

804
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,900
This, I think, more than anything else, has made me feel substantially better since the election,

805
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:59,900
and I wanted to take a moment to address that levity that we probably have on the last couple episodes.

806
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:04,900
It would be easy to get the impression that I don't think that Alex is as serious a problem anymore,

807
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,900
or that I feel like the work is done now that Trump is out of office,

808
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,900
and I want to make sure no one—

809
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,900
Strongly disagree.

810
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,900
I want to make sure no one thinks that that's where I'm coming from.

811
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:12,900
Yeah.

812
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,900
It's my job to watch Alex Jones and critique him,

813
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,900
and for a long time he's not made actual sense from the standpoint of what his character is supposed to be,

814
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:20,900
which is infuriating.

815
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,900
Yeah.

816
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,900
He's supposed to be the only person who can see through the elaborate communist plot to take over the country,

817
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,900
but he's apparently also supposed to be the guy that has the president's ear,

818
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,900
but he's also the guy who's mad that the president isn't doing everything he says.

819
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,900
It's convoluted.

820
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:40,900
The truth teller persona needs to be someone who is ignored, or is listened to by people who are perennial losers,

821
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,900
like Ron Paul.

822
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,900
If you don't do it that way, too many unanswerable questions come up that penetrate the facade.

823
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,900
I'm grateful to be able to study Alex Jones during this period

824
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,900
where his persona was completely out of sync with the reality he's trying to present,

825
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:58,900
but I'm also incredibly relieved to re-enter a world where he's back where he belongs.

826
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:03,900
Time will tell if he's able to pull off the transition back to that place,

827
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,900
where he gets to yell on the street and everyone, you know, chants and stuff.

828
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,900
Time will tell.

829
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,900
But if he can, I have a hunch that there's a lot of money to be made off semi-red-pilled folks

830
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,900
who find themselves unsatisfied by Fox News but think QAnon's insane.

831
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,900
Yeah.

832
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:25,900
I think that Alex could have a pretty fucking profitable time if he's able to thread the needle back.

833
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:30,900
I can't believe that we're positioned in a place where it seems like all of these right-wing people

834
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:36,900
are just going to slide back into their positions, but we're going to have a higher tolerance for it.

835
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:37,900
You know what I'm saying?

836
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:44,900
Yeah, it could be a situation where some people are going to come out of this more sanitized to normal reality.

837
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:53,900
People like Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio might come off with a sheen of sensibility

838
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,900
because they're not saying Trump should say he's the winner or whatever.

839
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

840
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:06,900
And then other people might, I think there's going to be a drastic reorganization in terms of media folk.

841
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:16,900
I think that so much radicalization and so much, you know, nonsense has happened in the last four years

842
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:22,900
that I don't think most people are going to be satisfied by Fox News.

843
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:30,900
The audience that they have catered to I think might have progressed past the point of what they're able to create.

844
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,900
Yeah, they radicalized them beyond a point where they can control or satisfy them.

845
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:41,900
It feels like that's a real possibility and that could be an amazingly huge market for people like Alex.

846
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,900
If they're able, like I said, if they're able to thread the needle.

847
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,900
And I think he wants to, I think he would love to because he loves money.

848
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,900
Yeah.

849
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,900
And he also seems to be having just a blast.

850
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,900
Yeah.

851
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,900
Listen to this.

852
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,900
This is Alex like, you know, I don't remember how free willy ends.

853
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,900
But I imagine that it ends with that whale getting to swim in the ocean.

854
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,900
Sure.

855
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,900
Free.

856
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:04,900
Yeah.

857
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,900
I think he jumps over the kid too.

858
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,900
Yes.

859
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,900
He's very majestic.

860
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,900
And it's really moving to see him like, you know, swimming.

861
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

862
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,900
This is kind of like Alex as free willy.

863
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,900
Okay.

864
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:14,900
This is just free willy.

865
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,900
I want to salute and commit her by the shot of her today.

866
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,900
It's going to get bigger and bigger as papers around the country see this.

867
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,900
And I know on Saturday, you're going to be out here with at least 10,000 people.

868
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,900
But I know to all the millions watching, we love you and we appreciate you.

869
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,900
And we'll never give up on America for this new world order takeover.

870
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,900
Yeah!

871
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,900
He just gets to say nothing and people get excited.

872
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:39,900
Yeah, that's great.

873
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:40,900
It's awesome.

874
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:41,900
That's great.

875
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:42,900
He never gets to hear cheers whenever he's on the show.

876
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,900
No.

877
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,900
And he can just yell catchphrases and people get excited.

878
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:46,900
Yeah.

879
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,900
And I want to salute all of you that came out here today.

880
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:56,900
You are just the beginning of the Second American World Order.

881
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:04,900
You all are pioneers in the next wave of the Republic.

882
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:11,900
Alex Jones has been right about everything.

883
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,900
Come on, Alex.

884
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,900
You don't need a job that bad.

885
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:14,900
All right.

886
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:15,900
We don't even need to.

887
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:16,900
Look, look, look.

888
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,900
Even Alex doesn't want to hear that.

889
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,900
99% of the time, kid.

890
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,900
He says it.

891
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,900
You don't tell him that.

892
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:23,900
Yeah.

893
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,900
Alex can just yell these catchphrases.

894
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,900
People get really excited.

895
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,900
And then when he runs out of breath, he'll have someone like Ali there to tag team the

896
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,900
mic with him.

897
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,900
It's great.

898
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,900
It's perfect.

899
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,900
That's Alex swimming free in the ocean.

900
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,900
Yeah.

901
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,900
It's a little, you know, I can understand that.

902
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:43,900
It's a little bit the difference now between doing an online comedy show for people watching

903
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,900
a screen versus going and doing a live stand-up set.

904
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,900
You're not going to get those same laughs, man.

905
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,900
You go out there and do it live.

906
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,900
That's the juice.

907
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,900
That's the way it feels good.

908
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,900
Yeah, perhaps, perhaps.

909
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,900
So Nick Fuentes is there.

910
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:57,900
That's the downside of doing it.

911
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:58,900
That is a huge problem for me.

912
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,900
Yeah.

913
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,900
Downside of doing live comedy is you might get booked on a show with Nick Fuentes.

914
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:02,900
That's true.

915
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,900
All right.

916
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,900
So he's there.

917
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,900
And he seems like this dude's scary as hell because I can kind of see what his program

918
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:09,900
is right now.

919
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:15,900
And that is, so earlier he did his thing where he brought like his, his griper movement.

920
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:16,900
Sure.

921
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,900
And they started trying to embarrass Charlie Kirk.

922
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,900
Right.

923
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,900
And Turning Point USA at all these live events.

924
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,900
I mean, I don't know.

925
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,900
I feel like they won.

926
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,900
Yeah.

927
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,900
It seems like they pretty much beat the shit out of Turning Point USA.

928
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,900
Yeah.

929
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,900
I don't know how, how effective Turning Point USA is.

930
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:39,900
And also another point, a point of that is also that like Charlie Kirk is getting older

931
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:45,900
and his whole appeal as a college ambassador is maybe a little bit less sensible at this

932
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:46,900
point.

933
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:52,900
But whatever the case, I do think that, you know, he set his sights on them and whether

934
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:58,900
he's responsible for them having a waning influence, he's now I think moving on to the

935
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,900
GOP.

936
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,900
Sure.

937
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:05,900
I think that there's a target on like the actual Republican party.

938
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,900
Yeah.

939
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,900
And I know that a lot of people, their mentality would be like, let them fight.

940
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,900
I understand that.

941
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:17,900
But also I think if you let them fight, you run the risk of like, okay, well any gains

942
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:23,900
made by people like Nick makes this a even more Nazi-ish party.

943
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,900
Yup.

944
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,900
Anyway, he's not happy about the GOP.

945
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,900
The Republican party has failed us.

946
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,900
We know there was a fraud.

947
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,900
We saw it on election day.

948
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,900
There is no question about it.

949
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,900
And since election day, we have heard from our Republican representatives, absolutely

950
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,900
nothing.

951
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,900
Mickey Haley has said nothing.

952
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,900
Dan Crenshaw has said nothing.

953
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:55,900
Marco Rubio in fact supports Biden stealing this election.

954
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:02,900
So what you have here is more or less them getting ready for Biden to win the election.

955
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,900
Right.

956
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:08,900
And then their focus will turn to inter GOP conflict.

957
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:09,900
Right.

958
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:15,900
This is sort of the model of the Tea Party, you know, where the fringe inside taking over

959
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,900
the party.

960
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:17,900
Yeah.

961
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,900
Seems like they're just doing it again, but the figures that are doing it are even more

962
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,900
extreme.

963
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

964
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,900
And great.

965
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,900
And I look forward to that because this cycle doesn't seem to just repeat itself and get

966
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,900
worse as it goes along.

967
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:34,900
No, it's a testament, I think, to the true level of contempt that the GOP party operatives

968
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:43,900
have towards their voters is just like, we're going to lie to them, essentially take them

969
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,900
captive to our bullshit, and then we'll be able to control them forever.

970
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,900
And then we'll leave them sitting ducks to demagogues like these assholes.

971
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:56,900
And then all of a sudden you lose control and the mob comes after you.

972
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,900
And you're like, no, we don't even need to worry about them.

973
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,900
The mob is just so stupid though.

974
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,900
You know, Nick Fuentes is going to remain on the fringe.

975
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,900
He's never going to come in here.

976
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:11,900
And in 20 years, you know, Supreme Leader Nick Fuentes is going to be great for us.

977
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,900
Ugh.

978
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:13,900
Ugh.

979
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:19,900
So I'm worried about Nick Fuentes in the sense that, like, this guy is a real shithead and

980
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,900
he's young and clearly...

981
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,900
His box has fewer air holes in it than Alex's and Alex got rid of all of his.

982
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:32,900
He has plans, you know, that's what makes him worrying to me.

983
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,900
Though I will say that sometimes he has ideas that just don't make any sense.

984
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,900
We want Trump! We want Trump!

985
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:45,900
And if we don't get him, the trucker strike that is coming up this month is only the beginning!

986
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,900
Yeah!

987
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:52,900
I'm not sure if Nick understands his political alignment very well, but he should realize

988
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:56,900
that it makes absolutely no sense for him to be calling for a strike of anything.

989
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:01,900
He's either a paleoconservative or a libertarian depending on when he's answering the question

990
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:06,900
and both of these political philosophies are super anti-union and super anti-strikes.

991
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,900
We want Trump! We hate unions!

992
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:16,900
And we want every trucker in United 541 to stand with us and strike against their horrible oppressors!

993
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:20,900
Yeah. Typically libertarians view unions as an extortion racket,

994
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,900
trying to get in the way of the freedom of an employer and an employee

995
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,900
freely agreeing to terms of trading money for labor.

996
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,900
They would likely support a worker's right to withhold their labor if the terms were unfair,

997
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,900
but they would definitely, and I mean definitely,

998
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,900
be way more passionate about supporting a business's right to replace that worker

999
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,900
with someone who would accept unfair terms.

1000
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,900
That's what freedom is about, after all, according to libertarians.

1001
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:50,900
We are together recognizing that in the face of an overwhelming government entity

1002
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,900
the only method of fighting back we have is to unite together

1003
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,900
and all of us utilize our power to neutralize their power

1004
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,900
and that's what we call libertarianism.

1005
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,900
Great. I don't see any possible way for Nick Fuentes to coherently call for a trucker strike

1006
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,900
in order to force Trump into office.

1007
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,900
If the truckers were to strike over their disapproval about an election,

1008
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,900
Nick's political belief set should require that he support the trucking companies

1009
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,900
bringing in scabs to do the work these truckers refuse to do.

1010
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,900
It doesn't matter because this isn't a statement that's meant to make political sense,

1011
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,900
nor is it even something he can pretend would be effective.

1012
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,900
This is a line he's throwing out in hopes of incitement.

1013
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,900
He's trying to pump up the crowd and planting images in their head of their side

1014
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,900
throwing the country into chaos with truckers refusing to work

1015
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,900
unless Trump is installed as president is exciting.

1016
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,900
It's exciting for them.

1017
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,900
I mean that's the classic fucking takeover playbook though

1018
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:50,900
is to utilize all the power of the stuff that you hate

1019
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:55,900
to get yourself into power and then close the door behind you as fast as you possibly can

1020
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,900
so other people can't unionize.

1021
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:58,900
Sure.

1022
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,900
Like that's how you do it.

1023
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:00,900
Yeah.

1024
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:01,900
That's the game man.

1025
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,900
So they're out there and it's fun enough but there's also lulls

1026
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,900
and when there are lulls Owen's got to talk and

1027
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,900
Oh that's not good.

1028
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,900
Here he says something very unsurprising.

1029
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,900
Looking at the crowd here as they begin to march into the building

1030
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:20,900
people who were on the caravan with me last week who are still part of this.

1031
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,900
So Americans are ready to go.

1032
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,900
They are not going to let this election be stolen from them.

1033
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:30,900
There are people you recognize from the caravan because you were in Atlanta.

1034
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,900
I don't understand.

1035
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:35,900
No they were in the cars the whole way.

1036
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,900
So the people who are info warrior types in Atlanta

1037
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,900
are very likely to come to both of these events.

1038
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:45,900
Oh I don't know if they have that kind of scheduling freedom.

1039
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,900
I'm certain most of them are unemployed.

1040
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,900
That's not fair.

1041
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,900
So Owen gets talking about this Dominion conspiracy.

1042
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,900
Oh that's great.

1043
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,900
Love me a good Dominion conspiracy.

1044
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,900
Man he believes just the dumbest version of this.

1045
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:05,900
You know record. It can all be done off location. It can all be done remotely.

1046
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,900
It's all been proven.

1047
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,900
That's why they run with these systems.

1048
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,900
That's why they tested it with Hugo Chavez in Venezuela

1049
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:22,900
and then when it worked to steal elections for the communists in Venezuela it went nationwide.

1050
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,900
You don't think that had something to do with

1051
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:25,900
You know it's so historic.

1052
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:26,900
Never mind sorry.

1053
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:30,900
So for the record Hugo Chavez died in 2013 and won his last election in 2012.

1054
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:35,900
So I guess the theory here is that this company stole the 2012 Venezuela election as a test run

1055
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,900
then eight years later paid it all off with the US election.

1056
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:43,900
This naturally raises the question of why the globalists didn't just use it in 2016

1057
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,900
but we're playing with conspiracies so let's not bring real questions into it.

1058
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,900
They weren't ready yet.

1059
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,900
Chavez had just died in 2013. They weren't sure if it was going to work out.

1060
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,900
Three years prior.

1061
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:58,900
It's a mourning period. Have you not read about international and intergalactic contract law?

1062
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:04,900
So the conspiracy that Owen is spinning is made out of combining details about two different companies

1063
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,900
and then insisting you've proven something suspicious.

1064
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,900
The two companies at issue are Dominion and Smartmatic.

1065
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:14,900
Part of the way this conspiracy is presented is to claim that these are the same company

1066
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,900
or that Dominion owns Smartmatic but that's not the case.

1067
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:18,900
They are unrelated.

1068
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:22,900
Smartmatic is a company that's provided election technology in Venezuela

1069
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:27,900
but they actually have a history of calling out voting problems like they did in August 2017

1070
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:31,900
when they found that the results of the constituent assembly election had been altered

1071
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,900
which they knew because their system is tamper evident

1072
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,900
and set to quote self-report any attempt to interfere with it.

1073
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:42,900
Dominion has nothing to do with Venezuela so the ability to connect Venezuela with Dominion

1074
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,900
relies on connecting these two companies which are not connected and are actually competitors.

1075
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:52,900
It's important to remember here that the game that these people are engaging in is not to make a coherent point.

1076
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:56,900
Their goal is to create a perception where they're right and everyone's out to get them.

1077
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,900
In this case, the connection to Hugo Chavez is really telling

1078
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,900
because it's not about a connection that's real.

1079
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,900
It's about tying this whole thing to a right-wing boogeyman.

1080
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:10,900
The anti-communist right-wing view Hugo Chavez as one of the world's greatest evils

1081
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:16,900
so involving him in this conspiracy is essentially, I don't know, fan service for weird right-wingers.

1082
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:20,900
I'm surprised they haven't just picked a bunch of the different left-wing governments

1083
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,900
America's tried to topple over the years.

1084
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:23,900
Why not?

1085
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,900
No, no, no. Because Hugo Chavez is high profile.

1086
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:27,900
Oh, that's true.

1087
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:35,900
And he's a figure that most, like, Fox News watchers would be familiar with as a heel.

1088
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,900
As a boogeyman, yeah. As a heel, if you will.

1089
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:43,900
Yeah, so he's almost the perfect person to use as almost like a signifier.

1090
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,900
And he's dead so it's not like he's going to come at you.

1091
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,900
Sure. I don't know how he would sue anyway, but...

1092
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,900
I don't think he was interested in suing Dan.

1093
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:57,900
So in this next clip, this is where I just kind of lost my patience with Owen.

1094
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:03,900
We're going to pick up the live stream from the Capitol again in about a half an hour.

1095
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:10,900
I've got other news I'm going to get to as well as video reports in the meantime.

1096
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,900
Boy, I mean, it's just so...

1097
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:18,900
Do I go down the fake pandemic and everything they're doing with the torture, psychological torture?

1098
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,900
I'm speaking as a producer here.

1099
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,900
Infowars is currently in a no-win situation.

1100
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:28,900
You basically have two main event players in the entire company with Alex and Owen.

1101
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:33,900
Owen sucks and all that, but compared to the rest of these zeroes, he's basically Dominique Wilkins,

1102
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,900
which I say because Alex is in Atlanta.

1103
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,900
There are two roles that currently need to be filled.

1104
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,900
One is in studio and one is remote.

1105
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:45,900
And because there are only two people who can reasonably fill those roles, they have to do those jobs.

1106
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,900
With two roles and two people, there are only two possibilities of how to organize things,

1107
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,900
which is both trash in terms of presentation.

1108
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:55,900
One option is having Alex in studio and Owen on the road.

1109
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:00,900
This is good because Alex is much, much better as a broadcaster, and he knows how to move the products.

1110
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:04,900
And he can say nothing passionately for an hour.

1111
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:11,900
The downside, however, is that Owen is not a draw, so you end up with really lackluster, disappointing remote events.

1112
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,900
Even on his best day, Owen can't get a crowd revved up like Alex.

1113
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:18,900
Alex is old school on a bullhorn, and Owen is just a pretender.

1114
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:23,900
The other option is what we have here, where Owen is in studio and Alex is on the road.

1115
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:27,900
The upshot here is that you probably get more compelling video from the road,

1116
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:30,900
because Alex is probably drunk, and he knows how to get people pumped up.

1117
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,900
More people are also going to show up, naturally, if Alex Jones is somewhere,

1118
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,900
compared to if Owen Schroyer is there.

1119
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:37,900
He's a sideshow.

1120
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:41,900
Yeah, so if the goal is optics of large crowds, you really need Alex there.

1121
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:47,900
At the same time, you run into problems with the show itself, because Owen's just not that good as a host.

1122
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:51,900
It's so goddamn boring, and I can't imagine he's moving any pills.

1123
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,900
He says something like,

1124
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,900
we'll get back to the feeds of Alex and Allie in half an hour,

1125
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,900
and all I can think is, well, here comes a shitty half hour.

1126
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,900
This is a substitute teacher showing a movie.

1127
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:08,900
And the movie is Alex yelling into a bullhorn, and sometimes that movie stops.

1128
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,900
Yeah, and you're like, what do we do now? Let's play Heads Up, Seven Up.

1129
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:15,900
No, let's listen to Owen talk for a half hour? No, fuck that noise.

1130
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:19,900
It's a tough situation if you're in charge at Infos and you have to figure out how to assign roles,

1131
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:24,900
but if it were me, I would never have Alex out of studio.

1132
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:29,900
He may draw a bigger crowd, but there are going to be a ton of people in Atlanta no matter what,

1133
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:34,900
and Owen isn't as exciting as Alex, but combined with Allie Alexander and Nick Fuentes,

1134
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,900
it might end up not being as poorly attended as the caravan.

1135
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,900
You need Alex in studio for multiple reasons.

1136
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,900
The first is that he's the only person exciting enough to make this dumb show watchable,

1137
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:49,900
and thus make people more likely to buy the pills.

1138
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:53,900
There's a financial reality that Alex is better for business as the host.

1139
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:58,900
Then, on top of that, the whole point of Infowars right now is that shit is super dangerous.

1140
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:02,900
Antifa and Black Lives Matter are trying to kill all the conservatives.

1141
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:06,900
Remember a few months ago, Alex said that China and MS-13 had teamed up with the Democrats

1142
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:10,900
to take out conservative talk show hosts? Legitimately, no.

1143
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:13,900
He did. In hindsight, that narrative makes a lot more sense

1144
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,900
if we imagine that Alex is just an out-of-control stimulant addict.

1145
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:17,900
Yeah, that would make sense.

1146
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:23,900
Anyway, I would advise Infowars to lean into this whole thing and make the studio feel like Alex's bunker.

1147
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,900
The whole point of his career is supposed to be that he's the oracle,

1148
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:30,900
the only person in the world who can see directly through the globalist plans.

1149
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,900
The literal devil has been trying to enlist him since he was a child

1150
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,900
because the devil knew that Alex was special and he was a psychic.

1151
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:41,900
If you expect me to believe any of that, you have to protect that person at all costs.

1152
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,900
The psychic who's the only person who knows what the globalists are going to do before they do it

1153
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:51,900
is way too valuable to have out on the street yelling into a bullhorn with a couple of young enterprising bigots.

1154
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,900
Yeah, that's not the best military tactics I would suggest.

1155
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:54,900
No, no, no!

1156
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:55,900
I would say.

1157
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,900
Now that Infowars has become something so comical and hyper important,

1158
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,900
it's time for them to get right with the script.

1159
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:04,900
Alex is supposed to be this all-important guru, so he needs to start acting like it.

1160
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:08,900
The studio's already established as having guns everywhere and being super well protected,

1161
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,900
so Alex should only be making appearances from there.

1162
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:14,900
Owen is the young gun, the warrior in the fold,

1163
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:18,900
so he needs to be Alex's proxy on the streets, willing to risk it all

1164
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:23,900
because he knows that his muscles and physical form are all that he has to give to the Infowar.

1165
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:24,900
That's true.

1166
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,900
I'm going to move on now because I'm getting lost in flights of fancy

1167
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,900
about the ideal direction for Infowars to go in the future,

1168
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,900
and again, as we touched on at the beginning of the show,

1169
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,900
we keep coming up with better ideas for them and then they just don't do it.

1170
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:36,900
I've got you beat by a mile.

1171
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,900
No, no, can I tell you one of my other things before you do it?

1172
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:39,900
Sure, sure, sure. Go for it.

1173
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:43,900
So they like to try and present Harrison Smith as like the smart research guy.

1174
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:44,900
Sure.

1175
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,900
So I just had this image of him like every single fucking time you're on camera,

1176
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:51,900
you'd be peeking out from behind a comically large book.

1177
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,900
With glasses all the way on the tip of your nose.

1178
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,900
Yes, and wear a fucking robe.

1179
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:59,900
Yeah, totally. Totally. What are we doing here?

1180
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:01,900
Like, why not?

1181
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,900
Bring Joe Biggs back in and have him always have grease on him somewhere

1182
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,900
because he's like a mechanic type or something.

1183
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,900
Yeah, look like a monk.

1184
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,900
He's a monk in there. He's got the...

1185
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,900
Joe Biggs has been fixing cars.

1186
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,900
Yeah, always, always been fixing cars.

1187
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,900
Turn this into an episode of Taxi.

1188
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:20,900
That's what I want. Danny DeVito should be hired by Infowars.

1189
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:25,900
Why not? At this point, just fucking, like, nothing that they say is real,

1190
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,900
so why not make all the characters actual fun characters?

1191
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:30,900
Yeah, that'd be fun.

1192
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,900
Christopher Lloyd could be involved. He's still alive.

1193
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:36,900
Alex, I know you're listening. I don't think you're listening,

1194
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:40,900
but if you're listening, I will quit doing this show in order to produce

1195
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,900
the next season of Infowars.

1196
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:45,900
I've got you beat by a mile, Dan, and it's...

1197
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,900
I'll bring you in as a co-executive producer.

1198
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,900
It's easy. It's easy.

1199
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:55,900
How can Alex be in both places at once, you ask yourself?

1200
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:01,900
Why are you wasting money on a fucking tank when you could have a hologram?

1201
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:02,900
Yeah, that's interesting.

1202
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:07,900
Harrison Smith comes with you, puts the little hologram Alex on the floor.

1203
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:11,900
He's got a fake bullhorn. He does the whole thing remotely,

1204
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,900
maybe does a little moonwalk.

1205
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,900
I assume that they're going to mix the Michael Jackson hologram

1206
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,900
with his to look a little bit better.

1207
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,900
With a record, you'd still need a recording, though.

1208
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:21,900
That's true.

1209
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,900
Alex's time would still be strained that way.

1210
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:25,900
I could sing Beat It for a while.

1211
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:26,900
Yeah, you certainly could.

1212
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,900
Beat it.

1213
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,900
No one wants to be defeated.

1214
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,900
Show them how funky...

1215
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:39,900
Give them a hologram saxophone, just...

1216
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,900
I could see it.

1217
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:45,900
So, yeah, I just think that there's intrinsic problems with people

1218
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,900
in the roles that they're in.

1219
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:52,900
Like, they can do specific things to a certain level of competence.

1220
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:56,900
And unfortunately, Alex can do multiple things,

1221
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:00,900
but the other people he has can't.

1222
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:04,900
And the only way to maximize everybody's skill sets

1223
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:07,900
is to have them all start playing characters.

1224
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:11,900
And in order for this to feel right, Alex can never be out of studio.

1225
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,900
I know that he wants to be, and it is, like I said,

1226
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,900
his free willy natural environment to be out there yelling into a bullhorn,

1227
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,900
but that's not his place anymore.

1228
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,900
Yeah, right. I mean, it is a little bit, though,

1229
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,900
that none of them really understand who they are,

1230
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,900
because they all think that they're way better than who they are.

1231
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:30,900
Yes.

1232
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:33,900
They all think that they're Paul Revere or some shit.

1233
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:37,900
Everyone who works at Infowars is Lance Stevenson.

1234
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:40,900
They think that they're fucking Kevin Durant.

1235
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:41,900
Okay.

1236
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,900
But you're still Lance Stevenson, okay?

1237
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,900
You're gonna blow in Lebron's ear.

1238
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,900
That's your job. That's all you've got.

1239
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,900
It's not gonna score 20 a night. It's just not gonna happen, man.

1240
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:54,900
You're a dick. Play your role.

1241
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:59,900
It would be better, I think, for everybody if they did play their roles.

1242
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:00,900
Totally.

1243
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:04,900
And, God, it would just be more funny for me, too.

1244
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:05,900
It'd be great.

1245
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:09,900
But then that goes back to everybody would have to have

1246
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:13,900
a base level of competence that just simply doesn't exist.

1247
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,900
And we can't wheel it into existence.

1248
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:18,900
But they could if they focused.

1249
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:22,900
Okay, then everybody requires a base level of focus that does not exist.

1250
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:26,900
The reason that Owen probably hasn't gotten better at going out

1251
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:30,900
and doing these road things is because he also has to do the war room.

1252
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:31,900
Right.

1253
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,900
He has to wear these multiple hats.

1254
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:38,900
Obviously, if he spent all his time focusing on, like,

1255
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:42,900
all right, how do we manipulate crowds to the best of our ability?

1256
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:43,900
Sure.

1257
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,900
That shots work best in field pieces.

1258
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:46,900
Right.

1259
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:49,900
If he really studied his craft and really tried to hone that,

1260
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:52,900
he could be an amazing tool for Alex to use

1261
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,900
while Alex is the guru in studio.

1262
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:56,900
Yeah.

1263
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:57,900
Doing what he does best.

1264
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:58,900
Right.

1265
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:03,900
And if he had other employees that he had just work in specific areas

1266
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:07,900
to be like, you are the person that I need to cover tech shit.

1267
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:08,900
Sure.

1268
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:09,900
Because I don't understand tech stuff.

1269
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:10,900
Right.

1270
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,900
You, Harrison Smith, you have glasses, you look like a dweeb.

1271
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:13,900
Yeah.

1272
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:14,900
We need you for that.

1273
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:15,900
Do it.

1274
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:16,900
Step into it.

1275
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:17,900
Yeah.

1276
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:18,900
It's kind of what Alex tried to do with, like, Mike Adams.

1277
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:19,900
Mm-hmm.

1278
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,900
Whenever there's a health story, we got the health ranger,

1279
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,900
you know, that can be the reliable voice on that front.

1280
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:25,900
Sure, sure, sure.

1281
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:26,900
He needs that.

1282
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,900
He needs the people who fit the tool,

1283
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:32,900
or are the tools for the jobs that need to be done.

1284
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,900
Yeah, but that would require Alex to have any interest

1285
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:41,900
in in-house talent development, which it seems he has strenuously avoided.

1286
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:45,900
Well, yeah, because I think he's trying to go for these cheap pops.

1287
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:46,900
Yeah, and no one is.

1288
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,900
Someone like Ali Alexander or Nick Fuentes,

1289
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:52,900
it's like, all right, you're trying to capitalize on whatever audience

1290
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:53,900
they already have.

1291
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:54,900
Exactly.

1292
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,900
But they're also using you.

1293
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:57,900
Yep.

1294
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,900
And it's not going to work out in any kind of long run.

1295
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:00,900
Yeah.

1296
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:05,900
Yeah, it's a bad strategy, and I hate to keep giving him advice,

1297
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,900
but yeah, you need to develop some talent.

1298
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:08,900
He hasn't.

1299
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:09,900
And it's too late, probably.

1300
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:13,900
Has anybody he's had on camera in our entire time period improved?

1301
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,900
Do you know what I'm saying?

1302
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,900
I think Owen has some, but that's because he was super green

1303
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:20,900
in the beginning.

1304
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:25,900
I mean, other than a more increased, I suppose, professionalism,

1305
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:28,900
as opposed to being like, although at the same time,

1306
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:31,900
he was like fucking Hammer and Sickle and all that shit.

1307
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:32,900
I'm not saying he's good.

1308
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:33,900
No, he's not good.

1309
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:36,900
Okay, maybe Millie Weaver, but that's also just because

1310
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,900
the first time we saw her, she was Rainbow Snatch.

1311
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:39,900
That's true.

1312
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,900
And that stopped.

1313
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:41,900
It's hard to come back from that.

1314
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:44,900
Yeah, no, I don't think that there's a lot of proficiency

1315
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:48,900
and skill development going on at Info Wars,

1316
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:52,900
but here's what I would say is one of the main problems.

1317
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:59,900
It's such a singular Alex Jones-focused world that you have people like Owen

1318
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:03,900
trying to host the show, and he's clearly trying to be Alex.

1319
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:04,900
Totally.

1320
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,900
I feel that, oh my gosh, you've got Democrats.

1321
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:12,900
You know, I'm going to try not to yell and scream

1322
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:13,900
and get frustrated today.

1323
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:17,900
It's just Democrats are the most disingenuous scum

1324
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:23,900
I've ever seen in my life, and it's just so sick.

1325
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:25,900
That's just a bad Alex impression.

1326
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:26,900
No kidding.

1327
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:30,900
One of his fake breakdowns with long pauses for dramatic effect.

1328
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,900
He's just doing the exact same thing that Alex does,

1329
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,900
but it comes so falsely.

1330
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,900
Yeah, it's way less believable.

1331
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:37,900
Yeah.

1332
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:38,900
He's a bad actor.

1333
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,900
No, he needs to find his own lane, his own voice.

1334
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,900
He's like a comic doing someone else's delivery, basically.

1335
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,900
It's tragic.

1336
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:51,900
Because you have stuff like that, and that just falls fucking flat.

1337
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,900
And then it goes to commercial, and Alex is back,

1338
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,900
and he's doing shit like this, and you're like,

1339
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:59,900
holy shit, you're running circles around people.

1340
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:01,900
Who do you think's up in that blimp?

1341
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,900
I'll tell you who.

1342
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,900
He's been sitting over us for like 30 minutes.

1343
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:10,900
Brian Stelter, punky-dumpty, is out there surveilling us in that.

1344
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:13,900
Listen, I'm not saying he's a child molester.

1345
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:14,900
I'm just saying I wouldn't let him pick my kids,

1346
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:16,900
and he looks like a child molester.

1347
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:17,900
What are you going to do?

1348
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,900
What is this, Aeon Flux?

1349
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:22,900
Everybody's floating in fucking dirigibles above us,

1350
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:23,900
watching everything?

1351
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:24,900
What are you talking about?

1352
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,900
Owen's in studio doing a bad Alex impression,

1353
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,900
then you cut to Alex in the field.

1354
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:31,900
He's accusing Brian Stelter of stalking him by blimp.

1355
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:35,900
Democrats are just the most disingenuous people.

1356
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:40,900
I think God is in a blimp shitting on all of us right now!

1357
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:43,900
I mean, what do you do with this?

1358
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:45,900
It is like watching Michael Jordan.

1359
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,900
You're like, he's just too good.

1360
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:50,900
Owen, just fucking sit down.

1361
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:51,900
Sit down.

1362
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:52,900
You're Horace Grant.

1363
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,900
You're not even Scottie Piffer.

1364
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:55,900
Get the fuck out of here.

1365
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,900
There's a part of me that kind of,

1366
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,900
I mean, Alex is wrong, and he's a monster,

1367
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:04,900
but there is a part of me that if he's frustrated with his staff,

1368
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:05,900
I get it.

1369
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:06,900
Yeah.

1370
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:07,900
They're not good.

1371
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:08,900
No.

1372
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,900
He can do all of these things better than them,

1373
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:11,900
and I guess he should be able to.

1374
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:12,900
Sure.

1375
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:13,900
He's 26 years into this career.

1376
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:14,900
For sure, for sure.

1377
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:17,900
I mean, Owen started at Infowars in 2016,

1378
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:20,900
so it makes sense that he would be better,

1379
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,900
but it's embarrassing the level of better.

1380
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:23,900
It is.

1381
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:26,900
And he's doing a really bad job of fostering

1382
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:32,900
and sort of mentoring them in terms of whatever skills they have

1383
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:33,900
not being emphasized,

1384
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:37,900
if only illustrated by the fact that Owen's just doing an Alex impression.

1385
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:38,900
Yeah.

1386
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:43,900
Well, I mean, it's like Trump and his whole administration and shit.

1387
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:46,900
It's like, I just,

1388
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:50,900
you bear the responsibility for hiring shitty people.

1389
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:51,900
You do.

1390
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:52,900
That's part of your job.

1391
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,900
Yeah, that's the administrative responsibility.

1392
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:58,900
Yeah, and if they're shitty, you bear responsibility for not improving them

1393
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,900
or even seemingly attempting to.

1394
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,900
Yeah, that's why there's performance reviews in a lot of normal work environments.

1395
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:04,900
Yeah.

1396
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,900
So, yeah, this is all Alex's fault.

1397
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:07,900
Oh, sure.

1398
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:08,900
I mean, the buck stops there,

1399
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:13,900
but just in terms of pretending this is a chaotic environment

1400
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:20,900
where it's just perform Alex's just running circles.

1401
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:25,900
It's almost outrageous watching this episode,

1402
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,900
the difference that you see.

1403
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:28,900
Yeah.

1404
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:32,900
It's like I want to give a round of applause

1405
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,900
that he thinks Brian Stelter is stalking him in a balloon.

1406
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:35,900
That is pretty great.

1407
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:36,900
That's hilarious.

1408
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:37,900
That's really great.

1409
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:38,900
That's really funny.

1410
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:39,900
Yeah.

1411
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:41,900
Not as good as a Dalek with a gun, but it's still good.

1412
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:42,900
No.

1413
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:43,900
It's still good.

1414
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:44,900
Yeah, I do like the image, though.

1415
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:45,900
It's out of note.

1416
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:46,900
Because I see-

1417
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:47,900
Brian Stelter's got binoculars.

1418
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:51,900
I see the Hindenburg level where it's a giant blimp

1419
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:56,900
and he's down and he's fucking, he's got a ship's captain vibe to him.

1420
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,900
He's doing that whole thing, looking out the window,

1421
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,900
just leaning down, just being like that motherfucker again.

1422
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:06,900
He's bought the hat that Alex wore on Halloween years back.

1423
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,900
He's wearing it.

1424
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,900
He's playing Flight of the Valkyries while-

1425
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:15,900
Yeah, with one of those sextant.

1426
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,900
I don't know.

1427
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:21,900
Well, as we all know, Brian Stelter only navigates by stars.

1428
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:22,900
Yes.

1429
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:26,900
So, I mean, Alex is coming in with this just dunking on Owen,

1430
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,900
being like, Brian Stelter's stalking me.

1431
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:34,900
And then, he's so good at this that he's even doing commercials from the road.

1432
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,900
He's doing commercials from- God damn it.

1433
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,900
Right outside Atlanta is the Georgia Guidestones, ladies and gentlemen.

1434
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:43,900
So, we're here covering all this, trying to stop the steal,

1435
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,900
educating people about what's really happening.

1436
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,900
And the only way I could bring a security team with Antifa

1437
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,900
and Black Lives Matter threat here, and they're strong here,

1438
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:52,900
the only way we could be here to cover all this

1439
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,900
and to seriously focus on what's happening is your financial support.

1440
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:58,900
So, I want to thank you all for going to Infowarsstore.com,

1441
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,900
getting great t-shirts, books, films, water filtration,

1442
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:02,900
and then all the great supplements.

1443
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,900
These are the highest quality, highest end supplements.

1444
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,900
When I forget to take them, I really feel it.

1445
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,900
I'm sorry, it burns the candle at both ends.

1446
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,900
And without DNA Force Plus-

1447
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:11,900
So, yeah, he just goes into a net.

1448
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:12,900
Yeah.

1449
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:13,900
It's remarkable.

1450
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:14,900
Effortless.

1451
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:17,900
He even recognizes that probably Owen's not doing a good enough job

1452
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:21,900
of pushing the product, selling things to keep things afloat.

1453
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:26,900
So, he knows that it's his job to not only go out there to draw a crowd

1454
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,900
to make the optics that they need to push this argument

1455
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:32,900
that the people are demanding Georgia flip,

1456
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:38,900
but he also needs to get on air and add pivot to try and sell pills.

1457
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:44,900
I mean, the weight of the Infowar is squarely on his shoulders.

1458
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,900
Yeah, I really don't understand how-

1459
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,900
See, that's the other thing that I don't understand.

1460
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,900
How is Owen not self-imb-

1461
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:54,900
Like, do you think he watches clips of his own-

1462
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:59,900
Like, when I was doing stand-up, I would listen to my sets over and over.

1463
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:03,900
I would watch myself do sets, and I would critique my performance.

1464
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,900
You know he doesn't do any of that shit.

1465
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,900
But, like, what's the incentive to?

1466
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:13,900
Exactly. Be good at your job. I feel like that's a good incentive.

1467
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:16,900
I feel like Owen could probably make a pretty decent argument

1468
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,900
that he's as good as he needs to be.

1469
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,900
He has a show on Infowars.

1470
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:21,900
Sure.

1471
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:28,900
It's basically the top of the, like, commercial conspiracy bullshit world.

1472
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:32,900
Like, in terms of that media, it's a job.

1473
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:37,900
You get paid. You're on Infowars with Alex Jones.

1474
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,900
Yeah, but that's like somebody saying, like,

1475
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:43,900
oh man, I have always dreamt of playing triple-A ball,

1476
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,900
and I made it, and now I'm done.

1477
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:49,900
Like, don't you want to get to the show, man? Come on!

1478
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:52,900
But the dark reality is, for him, this is the show.

1479
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,900
That's true. Ooh, that is a dark reality.

1480
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:55,900
Yeah.

1481
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,900
Because, like, for us, we're looking at it, it's like,

1482
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,900
oh, you could work for a real outlet.

1483
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,900
That would be, like, the equivalent of going to the majors.

1484
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:03,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1485
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,900
But that's not the way he looks at it.

1486
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:06,900
That's true.

1487
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,900
That's not the way the people in this sphere look at it.

1488
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:12,900
The only place to go up would maybe be Breitbart,

1489
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:13,900
and that's probably not even.

1490
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:14,900
No.

1491
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:16,900
Like, you could work for Drudge, but Drudge is out of pocket now,

1492
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:17,900
so you can't do that.

1493
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,900
Yeah, Drudge isn't a home for you.

1494
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:21,900
OAN maybe, but that's kind of a lateral move.

1495
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:22,900
And they don't want you.

1496
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:23,900
Probably not.

1497
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:25,900
Their hosts are boring, but in a different way.

1498
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:27,900
They might want Owen, but not Alex.

1499
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:28,900
Yeah, that's definitely true.

1500
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:30,900
Well, you could work for Rebel Media, but then again,

1501
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:31,900
that's another lateral move.

1502
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:32,900
Sure.

1503
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,900
He's about at the top of the mountain.

1504
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:35,900
That's sad.

1505
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:36,900
That is really sad.

1506
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:37,900
Owen's peaked.

1507
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,900
That's really, really, really sad.

1508
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:40,900
I'm bummed.

1509
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:41,900
Yeah.

1510
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:42,900
I'm bummed.

1511
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:45,900
I can't wait to have him pump my gas someday.

1512
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:49,900
And to your question about, like, why doesn't Owen get better,

1513
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:53,900
one of the issues is whatever you accept becomes acceptable.

1514
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:57,900
And if you can get away with just doing this,

1515
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:59,900
why not always do this?

1516
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,900
Oh, man.

1517
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:04,900
I still sometimes wake up in the middle of the night

1518
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,900
and I'm thinking about bits that I've done

1519
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,900
and been like, how can I improve those?

1520
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,900
I'm probably never going to do standup again.

1521
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,900
There are stories all across the nation,

1522
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:15,900
including where I found this story today.

1523
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:17,900
I was doing a deep dive into this where the headline is

1524
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:20,900
from a black lady, goodwill ambassador,

1525
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,900
who hates white people with the headline,

1526
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,900
should white boys still be allowed to talk?

1527
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:30,900
That's in the Dixonian at Dixon College in Pennsylvania.

1528
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,900
You're allowed to be racist against white people.

1529
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,900
Deep dive, Owen did on this.

1530
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,900
Did he read it, Dan?

1531
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,900
Well, there's a couple important points I need to make.

1532
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:39,900
Okay.

1533
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:43,900
First, this essay that Owen found today on this show,

1534
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:47,900
he's complaining about, it was published in February 2019

1535
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:50,900
by the student newspaper at Dickinson College,

1536
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:52,900
a school with an enrollment just over 2,400.

1537
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,900
It was written by a guest writer,

1538
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,900
and it's obviously making a point that conversation in classes

1539
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:01,900
in the writer's experience are dominated by white male voices.

1540
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:02,900
Sure.

1541
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:03,900
From the essay, quote,

1542
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:04,900
in my time at Dickinson,

1543
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:07,900
I've listened to probably hundreds of white boys talk.

1544
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:08,900
It feels incessant.

1545
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,900
From classes and lectures to the news and politics,

1546
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,900
there's an endless line of white boys

1547
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:16,900
waiting to share their opinions on the state of feminism in America,

1548
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:20,900
whether the LGBTQ plus population finally has enough rights,

1549
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,900
the merits of capitalism, et cetera.

1550
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:26,900
The list of what white boys think they're qualified to talk about is endless.

1551
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,900
Something very few of them seem to understand is that

1552
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:32,900
their ill-informed, uncritical opinions do not constitute truth.

1553
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,900
It's kind of funny, actually,

1554
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:38,900
because the essay itself explains why Owen being offended by this essay is nonsense.

1555
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,900
Is exactly why he is, yeah.

1556
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:43,900
Quote, the second thing most white boys seem not to understand

1557
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:46,900
is that they do not exist separate from the rest of the world.

1558
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:47,900
You do not speak alone.

1559
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:51,900
You speak with the weight of every other white man who has spoken over a woman,

1560
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:54,900
erased the contributions of queer people from history,

1561
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:57,900
or denigrated broken English as unintelligent.

1562
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:58,900
No, no, no, no.

1563
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:01,900
When a black person does something, all black people are responsible for it,

1564
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:06,900
but as we all know, a white person is an individual and cannot be held against.

1565
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:09,900
You speak with the weight of policies and laws meant to forever define intelligence

1566
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:13,900
by how it measures up to the bros of America.

1567
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:15,900
As is made clear in the final paragraph of this essay,

1568
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:18,900
this is about Black History Month and how the writer doesn't approve

1569
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:22,900
of overvaluing white opinions, particularly when it's to the exclusion

1570
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:25,900
of other, quote, buried or ignored voices.

1571
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:29,900
Speaking as a white boy, I don't take any offense at this perspective.

1572
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:33,900
The style of writing seems to me very intentionally to be confrontational

1573
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,900
because it's an opinion piece about how her perspective and voice

1574
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,900
were being relegated as being less important than others,

1575
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:42,900
so rhetorically it works for the writing to be kind of brusque.

1576
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:43,900
Totally.

1577
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:44,900
It's stylistically sensible.

1578
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:47,900
No, as somebody with a partner who teaches high school, believe me,

1579
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,900
white boys talk too much.

1580
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:56,900
And I don't think, like, obviously this isn't this person making the argument

1581
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:59,900
that white people should never be able to talk.

1582
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:04,900
It's just a perspective of all this conversation on campus

1583
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:08,900
seems so much about issues that are unrelated to their experience.

1584
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:12,900
White males seem to take priority and precedence.

1585
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:17,900
Now, the other thing I would say is that the headline of this is

1586
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:19,900
Should White Boys Be Allowed to Talk?

1587
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:24,900
And I know from my time when I used to write for my campus paper,

1588
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:27,900
generally editors write the headlines.

1589
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:31,900
This person who wrote this article probably didn't write that headline,

1590
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:36,900
and she's being lambasted for the headline.

1591
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:40,900
The headline is more extreme than the actual article is.

1592
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,900
And if you're an editor trying to get more-

1593
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:43,900
Exactly.

1594
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:46,900
Then you would make an extreme headline so people would grab their attention.

1595
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:47,900
Yeah, yeah.

1596
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:50,900
It's, uh, I don't know.

1597
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:55,900
It's a willful misunderstanding of the point that was being made in this student newspaper.

1598
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,900
And the right-wing media did a cycle with this back in 2019.

1599
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:00,900
They already did this.

1600
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:02,900
Yeah, it's a yearly thing.

1601
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:04,900
It's like Christmas season.

1602
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:05,900
It's 21 months ago.

1603
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:07,900
It wasn't last year.

1604
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:09,900
Who said it was an annual thing?

1605
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:10,900
It is a yearly thing.

1606
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:13,900
It speaks volumes that Owen Schroyer decided to spend time on the show

1607
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:18,900
complaining about this college newspaper opinion piece from over a year and a half ago

1608
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:22,900
because he wants to whine about how bad it is and it's tough to be white.

1609
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:24,900
It's just very sad.

1610
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:25,900
I just want to throw things.

1611
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:29,900
It's remarkable.

1612
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:31,900
That length needs to be gone to.

1613
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:32,900
Yeah.

1614
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:41,900
I would argue that the person who is furious about an op-ed piece in a student newspaper

1615
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:47,900
that is thousands of miles away from him is the saddest person.

1616
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:48,900
Very sad.

1617
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:49,900
Yeah.

1618
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,900
Now, we go back to Alex out there, Bullhornin'.

1619
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:53,900
He's chanting.

1620
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:54,900
He's getting some chants going.

1621
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:55,900
Sure.

1622
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:56,900
There's some Stop the Steal chants.

1623
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:57,900
Are we going to do any locker ups?

1624
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:58,900
I feel like locker up never goes that style.

1625
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:00,900
No, I don't think there's any locker ups that I heard.

1626
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,900
But there's definitely some USAs.

1627
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,900
Quite a few of them.

1628
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,900
And then we get another surprise guest appearance.

1629
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,900
Let's go back to the state capitol in Atlanta.

1630
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,900
He's outside now with a big crowd, Bullhorning.

1631
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:15,900
Special session now.

1632
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,900
Special session now.

1633
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:18,900
Special session now.

1634
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,900
Special session now.

1635
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:22,900
Special session now.

1636
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,900
Special session now.

1637
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:26,900
Special session now.

1638
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:27,900
Special session now.

1639
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,900
Hey, right guy?

1640
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,900
Good job being here, brother.

1641
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:32,900
Appreciate you, man.

1642
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,900
Enrique Tarrio enters the picture.

1643
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,900
Cool!

1644
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:38,900
Enrique Tarrio and the Proud Boys have shown up

1645
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,900
with Alex and Nick Fuentes

1646
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,900
and Ali Alexander turning this into a

1647
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:44,900
real fucked up place.

1648
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:47,900
It's the Washington Generals of

1649
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:49,900
conservative propagandists.

1650
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,900
Yeah. But, so Alex is out there

1651
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:54,900
he's got this special session now chant going

1652
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,900
and I've been pretty, you know,

1653
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:59,900
effusive in my praise

1654
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,900
for Alex out on the street and his ability

1655
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:03,900
to rile up a crowd.

1656
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:05,900
But here is the point where I have to point out

1657
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:07,900
that he is only human.

1658
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:09,900
And he cannot get any chant going that he wants to.

1659
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:12,900
Because things fizzle out a little bit

1660
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,900
and Owen goes back to him

1661
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:16,900
and there's a little bit of a different picture.

1662
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:19,900
Let's go back live now, Alex Jones on the PA.

1663
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:27,900
Joe Allen is a communist Chinese agent.

1664
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:31,900
Joe Allen is a communist Chinese agent.

1665
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:33,900
This is not a joke.

1666
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:37,900
America is in grave danger.

1667
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,900
Do you think he was trying to

1668
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,900
start that as a chant? I think he was.

1669
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:43,900
Man, that's a long thing to chant.

1670
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,900
Well, yeah. With a bad meter?

1671
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,900
That's not good. No, it's not.

1672
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:49,900
I think he was. I think he was trying to get it going.

1673
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,900
That's bad. And also you can just hear

1674
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:53,900
there's just, it's flattened.

1675
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,900
There isn't wooing anymore.

1676
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:58,900
The rally is over.

1677
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:00,900
Those things have a time limit.

1678
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:02,900
It's true. People can only yell so much.

1679
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:04,900
You can only chant for so long. Sure.

1680
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,900
So Owen wants to make an analogy here.

1681
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:09,900
He's talking about these globalists, right?

1682
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:11,900
They're like bullies who steal your lunch money.

1683
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,900
Right? But they don't want you

1684
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,900
to talk about how they're bullying them

1685
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,900
and how some people might bully them.

1686
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,900
Their analogies are spectacular.

1687
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,900
This analogy stinks.

1688
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:23,900
I try to make analogies here.

1689
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:25,900
Try. You try.

1690
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:27,900
So people can understand.

1691
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,900
Because I don't know if people can understand

1692
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,900
what I'm saying half the time.

1693
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:33,900
It's like, is it just in my head this makes sense?

1694
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:35,900
Or is this translating on air?

1695
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:39,900
If you're in the

1696
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:43,900
high school lunch room

1697
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,900
and there's a guy going around

1698
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:49,900
stealing everybody's lunch money.

1699
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,900
Everybody's like, where's all my lunch money going?

1700
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,900
This is weird.

1701
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:55,900
And then you're like, hey uh,

1702
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,900
Steve over there

1703
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:59,900
has been going around

1704
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,900
stealing everybody's lunch money.

1705
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,900
I gotta pause it real quick because

1706
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:05,900
I didn't realize the first time

1707
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:07,900
I listened through this that

1708
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:09,900
he's imagining a scenario where this guy

1709
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,900
is stealthily stealing everyone's money

1710
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,900
as opposed to... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1711
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:15,900
It's a pickpocket.

1712
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:17,900
This is a high school pickpocket bully.

1713
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,900
Yeah, it's a high school bully cat burglar

1714
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:21,900
pickpocket.

1715
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,900
And then Steve comes up to you

1716
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,900
and says, hey man,

1717
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:27,900
don't say that. That's hateful against me.

1718
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:29,900
That could lead to violence against me.

1719
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:31,900
Well hold on a second, Steve.

1720
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,900
You're the one that stole all the lunch money.

1721
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:35,900
That's who the globalists are.

1722
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:37,900
That's who the Democrats are.

1723
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:39,900
That's who the mainstream media is.

1724
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,900
They've stolen your country.

1725
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,900
They've stolen your integrity.

1726
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,900
They've stolen your freedom.

1727
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:47,900
They've stolen your reality.

1728
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:49,900
They've stolen everything.

1729
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:51,900
They've stolen your future.

1730
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:53,900
They've stolen your children's future.

1731
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,900
They've stolen our education system.

1732
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:57,900
They have taken from us

1733
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,900
everything except the very breath

1734
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:01,900
from our mouths and now they're

1735
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,900
coming for that too with a stupid

1736
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,900
face mask.

1737
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:07,900
And so you just point the finger

1738
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:09,900
and say, you've committed these crimes.

1739
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:11,900
You've committed these atrocities.

1740
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,900
You're trying to make us a slave.

1741
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:15,900
You're lying to us. You're dividing us.

1742
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,900
You're gaslighting us. You're instigating

1743
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:19,900
us. You're doing it. And they say,

1744
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:21,900
don't say that. That could lead to violence

1745
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,900
against us. Well, you know what?

1746
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,900
Maybe you deserve what's coming.

1747
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:27,900
There we go. You ever thought about that?

1748
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,900
Oh wait, they have. That's why they're so

1749
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:31,900
scared.

1750
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,900
Did you really think we would just take

1751
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:37,900
actions?

1752
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:39,900
You usually thought you could control the mobs?

1753
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,900
No.

1754
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:45,900
No.

1755
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,900
That analogy that Owen used

1756
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:49,900
is not great, but I think I get the point.

1757
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,900
Owen understands that his position

1758
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:53,900
in life and his career is to be a stochastic

1759
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,900
terrorist and work really hard

1760
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:57,900
to inspire people to enact violence on his

1761
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:59,900
enemies, but he doesn't feel like he's

1762
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,900
wrong to do that because he's decided

1763
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:03,900
his enemies deserve it, his imagined enemies.

1764
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:05,900
That's not surprising to

1765
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,900
hear, and honestly it's a theme that kind of runs

1766
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:09,900
underneath a lot of Infowars programming,

1767
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,900
but it's weird to hear Owen be so

1768
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:13,900
blunt about those feelings of wanting mob

1769
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:15,900
violence. Seems like a bad move.

1770
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:17,900
You guys stole everything

1771
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:19,900
and I want everybody to

1772
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,900
solve this problem and you deserve

1773
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:23,900
violence, so I think we all know how we want everyone

1774
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:25,900
to solve this problem. It seems like a really bad move,

1775
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:27,900
particularly because we've done this enough times

1776
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,900
to know that should anything happen

1777
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:31,900
they'll call it a false flag.

1778
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:33,900
Also, it's almost

1779
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,900
impressive to me how much that rant

1780
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,900
felt forced.

1781
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,900
The emotion felt ungenuine,

1782
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:41,900
but in a completely different way than the falseness

1783
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,900
of Alex's outbursts. Alex

1784
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:45,900
is way over the top, growling

1785
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,900
and fake crying, almost like a clown's

1786
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:49,900
take on performing an emotion.

1787
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:51,900
When Owen gets rolling, it feels way

1788
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:53,900
too much like he's thinking in his head,

1789
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:55,900
alright, now it's time to get intense.

1790
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,900
You can almost hear him trying to figure out what to talk

1791
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:59,900
about next. It's a really boring

1792
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:01,900
version of insincerity, and I just

1793
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:03,900
don't enjoy it that much, as

1794
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:05,900
is style. Yeah, and as far

1795
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:07,900
I'm sorry to say this, but

1796
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:09,900
his voice gets real whiny.

1797
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:11,900
In the higher pitches,

1798
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:13,900
he cracks, his voice gets real whiny, and

1799
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:15,900
so his...

1800
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,900
YOU STOLE IT! AND YOU DID IT!

1801
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:19,900
It just doesn't sell it to me.

1802
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:21,900
I try not to be too critical

1803
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:23,900
on those kinds of fronts because I

1804
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:25,900
think that most... Says the man with the golden voice.

1805
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:27,900
Yeah, but I also have,

1806
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,900
you know, there are

1807
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,900
types of emoting

1808
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:33,900
that I can do where my voice is very annoying

1809
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:35,900
to folks as well.

1810
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:37,900
I think that a lot of people don't have... I call that

1811
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:39,900
talking for me. People don't have

1812
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:41,900
as much control over

1813
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:43,900
the tonal qualities

1814
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:45,900
of their voice as they want to

1815
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:47,900
without a lot of work going into it,

1816
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:49,900
so I always try and be

1817
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:51,900
understanding on that front.

1818
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,900
I mean just more in terms of the

1819
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:55,900
things that are very easily controllable.

1820
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:57,900
Right. You would think after four

1821
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,900
years you'd get a little bit better at

1822
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:01,900
faking an emotion if your job is

1823
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:03,900
basically to create

1824
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:05,900
and present emotions.

1825
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:07,900
Yeah, I mean if your job though, as you

1826
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:09,900
see it, is really just to do an Alex impression,

1827
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,900
you know. That's the problem.

1828
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:13,900
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So

1829
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:15,900
in this next clip, Owen writes some

1830
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:17,900
fan fiction about Trump

1831
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:19,900
and what he's up to while he's hiding.

1832
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:21,900
Sure. And just listen to this clip

1833
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:23,900
and ask yourself, how is this

1834
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:25,900
any different than what people online

1835
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:27,900
do with Q&A? Okay.

1836
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:29,900
But you know what? I think what

1837
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:31,900
President Trump is doing right now is he's giving

1838
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:33,900
these people one last chance.

1839
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:35,900
What? And he may have even given

1840
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:37,900
them a day and just said, you know what?

1841
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,900
I'm gonna go away. I'm gonna be quiet

1842
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:45,900
for about

1843
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:47,900
30 days.

1844
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:49,900
And you guys can concede this election

1845
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:51,900
and

1846
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:53,900
you can stop lying to the American

1847
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:55,900
people

1848
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:57,900
and you can stop making

1849
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,900
deals with the Communist Chinese and stop

1850
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:01,900
working for the UN and the World Health Organization

1851
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:03,900
and

1852
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:05,900
let me be President.

1853
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,900
Or you can

1854
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:09,900
continue to tick off the Americans.

1855
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:11,900
You can continue to tick

1856
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,900
off the Republic

1857
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:15,900
and I'll

1858
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:17,900
unleash this beast. I'll unleash

1859
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:19,900
this kraken. I'll let this line roar

1860
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:21,900
and you can deal with that

1861
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:23,900
instead.

1862
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:25,900
Because that's where this is

1863
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,900
going.

1864
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:29,900
Yeah, it's a million

1865
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:31,900
marchers in D.C. peacefully

1866
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:33,900
now. Yeah, it's gonna

1867
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,900
be thousands of people peacefully in Atlanta

1868
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,900
this weekend. But let me tell you,

1869
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:39,900
if you steal this election from us

1870
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:41,900
and you put in a UN

1871
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:43,900
Communist

1872
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:45,900
corrupt criminal Joe Biden in the White

1873
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:47,900
House, it's not gonna be a million peaceful

1874
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,900
marchers in D.C. No,

1875
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:51,900
no, no. Okay.

1876
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:53,900
Okay, so if Biden is

1877
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:55,900
inaugurated, we will kill. Yeah,

1878
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:57,900
I mean, more or less. Good work, guys.

1879
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:59,900
Thanks for your help. He's creating this

1880
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:01,900
fictitious imaginary scenario

1881
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:03,900
where Trump has given a deadline

1882
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,900
for the globalists

1883
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,900
to back down and stop pissing

1884
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:09,900
off the patriots. And it's gonna be at high

1885
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,900
noon 30 days from now.

1886
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:13,900
Because he's such a good guy.

1887
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:15,900
You have to give him that chance

1888
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,900
to do the right thing.

1889
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:19,900
And now this is where this idea

1890
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:21,900
that Owen is just creating out of

1891
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:23,900
his own fantasy. Isn't that the same thing the

1892
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:25,900
globalists have to do?

1893
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:27,900
Hey, interesting thought.

1894
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:29,900
That is an interesting thought. Because that dovetails

1895
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:31,900
in this next clip. Okay, here we go.

1896
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:33,900
Yeah. Trump's giving him one

1897
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,900
last shot. And of course

1898
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,900
they're not gonna stop.

1899
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:39,900
But see, just like they have to have that

1900
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:41,900
metaphysical comfort,

1901
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:43,900
just like they have to have that metaphysical

1902
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:45,900
comfort of you accepting

1903
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:47,900
the mask, you accepting the vaccine,

1904
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:49,900
you accepting

1905
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:51,900
the tyranny, you inviting the tyranny,

1906
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,900
that gives them the metaphysical comfort knowing

1907
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:55,900
they didn't force it on you. You accepted it.

1908
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,900
Trump, we have to have

1909
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:01,900
the same metaphysical comfort knowing that we

1910
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:03,900
gave them the last shot too. Why?

1911
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,900
Hey, we gave you one last chance

1912
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,900
to stop it, stop

1913
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:09,900
with the enslavement of mankind,

1914
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:11,900
stop with the lies

1915
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:13,900
that you're telling mankind,

1916
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:15,900
stop all of it, stop the election theft,

1917
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:17,900
you can stop it all right now. The censorship,

1918
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,900
you're coming after all of us. And they won't

1919
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,900
do it. But they've been given the metaphysical

1920
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:23,900
opportunity now.

1921
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:25,900
So there will be no

1922
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:27,900
excuses. Okay, this is a problem for

1923
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:29,900
me on a couple levels. Oh, there's a problem

1924
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:31,900
on a lot of levels. The first is that

1925
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:33,900
this is just a preemptive justification for

1926
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:35,900
murder. Yep. Owen is telling the audience

1927
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:37,900
that once Biden is president, that means

1928
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,900
the audience's enemies have turned down

1929
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,900
this imaginary last chance that Trump

1930
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:43,900
is offering them to give up their wicked ways.

1931
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:45,900
It's going to be tough to eat your neighbor

1932
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:47,900
but take comfort in the fact that they deserve it

1933
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,900
because Trump gave them the last chance. They had a chance.

1934
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,900
They could have changed their mind at any point in

1935
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:53,900
time. They've earned it. That's the function of this.

1936
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,900
Yep. The second issue I have is with

1937
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:57,900
Owen's understanding of Alex's bizarre

1938
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:59,900
moral system. Owen seems

1939
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:01,900
to think that it's about the globalists needing to feel

1940
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:03,900
comfortable that they give you a choice, but

1941
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,900
that's not what Alex believes.

1942
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:07,900
Alex believes there are literal cosmic

1943
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,900
laws that even the devil cannot break

1944
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,900
that involve you not being able to act

1945
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:13,900
counter to someone else's free will.

1946
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:15,900
It's not that it's a comfort to know you

1947
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:17,900
didn't force people to do something, it's a belief

1948
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:19,900
system that involves instant karma coming

1949
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:21,900
if you do. It's a necessity.

1950
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:23,900
I worry that Alex

1951
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:25,900
may not have fully explained this whole

1952
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:27,900
system of how the cosmos worked to Owen,

1953
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:29,900
which is troubling.

1954
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:31,900
I get the sense that maybe what happened is that

1955
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:33,900
Alex got pretty drunk a couple times and rambled

1956
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:35,900
at Owen about this. He misremembered

1957
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:37,900
some of it. This is all Owen remembers, yeah.

1958
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:39,900
It's about comfort, not

1959
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:41,900
the immutable laws of the universe.

1960
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:43,900
Even in, why,

1961
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:45,900
why, why are you

1962
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:47,900
saying that you have to do

1963
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,900
the same thing as the globalists?

1964
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:51,900
Shouldn't you be like, we don't have

1965
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:53,900
to do the globalists because we're not globalists?

1966
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:55,900
If you're saying we have to do the same thing as the globalists,

1967
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:57,900
that makes me think that you're actually globalists.

1968
01:36:57,900 --> 01:36:59,900
It's not the same thing, it just has sort of

1969
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:01,900
similarities.

1970
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:03,900
With the

1971
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:05,900
globalists, they're

1972
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:07,900
like, they have to

1973
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:09,900
trick you into doing something. Sure, of course.

1974
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:11,900
That's deceitful. With Trump,

1975
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:13,900
this is straight up. How?

1976
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:15,900
Because this is him being like, hey,

1977
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:17,900
everybody knows everything, this is your last

1978
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:19,900
chance. No, he would be straight up if he

1979
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,900
said that, but instead he's doing these weird

1980
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:23,900
esoteric legal challenges that don't

1981
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:25,900
make any sense. He's saying it to the globalists

1982
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:27,900
behind the scenes. Oh, okay.

1983
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:29,900
According to Owen's imagination.

1984
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:31,900
So then why do I have to die?

1985
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:33,900
Well, you had

1986
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:35,900
your chance. Okay, that's a good point.

1987
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:37,900
I did have my chance.

1988
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:39,900
You heard Owen imagine this

1989
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:41,900
thing, and you refused to get it on.

1990
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:43,900
Yeah, I had my

1991
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,900
obsolete acquiescence, I guess.

1992
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:47,900
Yeah, and I think that this also

1993
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:49,900
highlights the other thing where Owen is doing a

1994
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:51,900
bad Alex impression. Totally.

1995
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:53,900
His version of Alex's stupid moral

1996
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:55,900
system isn't interesting. It's even

1997
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:57,900
more stupid and less interesting.

1998
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,900
It's not interesting, whereas Alex seems like

1999
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:01,900
it's based on some kind of

2000
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:03,900
real fucked up

2001
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:05,900
belief system that

2002
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:07,900
I'm interested in unraveling. I'm not

2003
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:09,900
interested in listening to Owen

2004
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:11,900
miscommunicate it. Well, he clearly doesn't

2005
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:13,900
share that nonsensical

2006
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:15,900
belief. Of course not. He doesn't share it,

2007
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:17,900
and I don't think he actually understands

2008
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:19,900
what Alex is trying to convey,

2009
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,900
and so he just sort of botches it.

2010
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:23,900
But he is doing an Alex impression,

2011
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:25,900
and apparently this is some piece of this

2012
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:27,900
mythology that's important enough that

2013
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:29,900
he feels like he needs to also include

2014
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:31,900
it. Jesus. And it's just

2015
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:33,900
blah. Yeah. So anyway, I was

2016
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:35,900
about ready to say fuck all this,

2017
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:37,900
but Owen, every time

2018
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:39,900
I think I'm out, he pulls me back in.

2019
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:41,900
Alright. Coming up in the

2020
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:43,900
next segment,

2021
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:45,900
we're going to be joined by Alex Jones and

2022
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:47,900
by Nick

2023
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:49,900
Fuentes, and apparently

2024
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:51,900
Alex has a big announcement that he

2025
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:53,900
is going to be making,

2026
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:55,900
and he really wants me to emphasize that.

2027
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:57,900
So Alex is coming up, huge

2028
01:38:57,900 --> 01:38:59,900
announcement next segment.

2029
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:01,900
I am not positive there is a huge

2030
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:03,900
announcement, but when I hear that,

2031
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:05,900
you gotta stick around. Well, hello.

2032
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:07,900
That would be cool if he was going to

2033
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,900
sacrifice Nick Fuentes to Trump

2034
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:11,900
and eat his heart in

2035
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:13,900
public. Alex has shown

2036
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:15,900
inclinations towards cannibalism.

2037
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:17,900
I think that would work. I think I would definitely

2038
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:19,900
give Trump the presidency if Alex

2039
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:21,900
eviscerated Nick Fuentes and ate

2040
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:23,900
his heart live on air. The only

2041
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:25,900
thing that I think is kind of close to

2042
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:27,900
like maybe this is his huge announcement,

2043
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:29,900
because it's something I don't know if I've heard

2044
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:31,900
from him before,

2045
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:33,900
was he does say that

2046
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:35,900
the Austro-Hungarian empire did

2047
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:37,900
nothing wrong in the lead up to World War

2048
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:39,900
I. Okay, that's an issue for

2049
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:41,900
me. Somehow that's a new problem

2050
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:43,900
that I didn't know I had to converse with

2051
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:45,900
today. Well, I didn't, well we don't have to.

2052
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:47,900
Okay, good. Because I don't think that's his announcement.

2053
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:49,900
He does say that, and I got confused.

2054
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,900
We

2055
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:53,900
can talk about that another time if he brings

2056
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:55,900
it up again. I would like to hear more. It could have been

2057
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:57,900
a stray thought. He doesn't

2058
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:59,900
elaborate on it. He

2059
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:01,900
says it's all the British fault, their fault.

2060
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:03,900
Sure, sure, that sounds right.

2061
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:05,900
Anyway, that's not his announcement,

2062
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:07,900
but it could have been.

2063
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:09,900
Maybe it's that Nick Fuentes had the

2064
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:11,900
speech of the day. Best speech out

2065
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:13,900
there in Atlanta. And

2066
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:15,900
like I said. Did he just hiss for 25

2067
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:17,900
minutes? May as well have, but he hissed

2068
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:19,900
in the right direction. And that is

2069
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:21,900
at the GOP who aren't backing

2070
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:23,900
up Trump. Again, Nick is

2071
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:25,900
a guy who has a project.

2072
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:27,900
And his project now seems to be focused

2073
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:29,900
on being anti-GOP.

2074
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:31,900
He's a usurper.

2075
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:33,900
Mitch McConnell has said nothing. Nicky

2076
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:35,900
Haley has said nothing. Dan Crenshaw,

2077
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:37,900
Madison Cawthorne, all the people

2078
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:39,900
hailed as the future of the GOP have

2079
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:41,900
remained silent while people like

2080
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:43,900
myself and Alex and patriots

2081
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:45,900
like you coming out to the state capitals

2082
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:47,900
have been doing all the work and fighting

2083
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:49,900
for this. So we have to take the fight

2084
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:51,900
to them no matter what happens with President Trump.

2085
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:53,900
And let's

2086
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,900
be clear. We know China

2087
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:57,900
Joe's a bought and paid for

2088
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:59,900
enemy. He's not even a traitor. He's just a robot.

2089
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,900
But when you've got

2090
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:03,900
Marco Rubio and

2091
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:05,900
you've got the gay pirate

2092
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:07,900
Crenshaw and all these

2093
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:09,900
fake people doing

2094
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:11,900
all of this, they are literally

2095
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:13,900
worse than the enemy because they act

2096
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:15,900
like they're with us when they're really

2097
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:17,900
establishment folks. Yeah, so

2098
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:19,900
it seems like this is the direction

2099
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:21,900
that they will probably want

2100
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:23,900
to go next with

2101
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:25,900
their targets.

2102
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:27,900
Obviously you can always keep Soros

2103
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,900
and all that shit in the back burner.

2104
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:31,900
But yeah,

2105
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:33,900
ineffective, cowardly

2106
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:35,900
Republicans in name

2107
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:37,900
only can be the new enemy.

2108
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:39,900
The turncoats who didn't support

2109
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:41,900
Trump in his hour of need.

2110
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:43,900
Guys, I agree with you. They were lying

2111
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,900
to you the whole time. But in a different way

2112
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:47,900
than what you think. They were lying

2113
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:49,900
differently than you. Like it would

2114
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:51,900
almost, I wonder, sometimes I wonder

2115
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:53,900
like what would happen if the Murdochs

2116
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:55,900
just like one day were like

2117
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:57,900
hey, we

2118
01:41:57,900 --> 01:41:59,900
don't want everybody to be

2119
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:01,900
killed. So we're just gonna announce

2120
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:03,900
Fox News has been lying

2121
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:05,900
to you this whole fucking time. It was

2122
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:07,900
our idea. We wanted to get you guys

2123
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:09,900
to do the bullshit that we wanted to.

2124
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:11,900
Now, we don't want you to kill

2125
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:13,900
everybody. Sorry. Someone would

2126
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:15,900
find some investor in

2127
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:17,900
News Corp and be like

2128
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:19,900
well this is why they said that cause he got

2129
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:21,900
bought off but it would turn into a

2130
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:23,900
conspiracy of its own. It's never gonna change.

2131
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:25,900
So I think that

2132
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:27,900
Alex is really into this too

2133
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:29,900
and I think it's probably

2134
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:31,900
a really sound decision on his part

2135
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:33,900
in terms of where to take the rhetoric.

2136
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:35,900
Where to take the

2137
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:37,900
narratives. If you want to try and shift

2138
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:39,900
into some direction

2139
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:41,900
going against the

2140
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:43,900
ineffective

2141
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,900
turncoat Republicans or whatever

2142
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:47,900
is probably gonna be your best bet.

2143
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:49,900
Because then you'll probably get

2144
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:51,900
a little bit of the slack of

2145
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:53,900
people on the left caring about

2146
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:55,900
what you're doing. If you're attacking

2147
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:57,900
the people they don't like

2148
01:42:57,900 --> 01:42:59,900
less mean comments on Twitter

2149
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:01,900
are going to come in.

2150
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:03,900
And you saw exactly

2151
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:05,900
this model play out with

2152
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:07,900
Nick Fuentes when he started attacking

2153
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:09,900
Turning Point there was a lot

2154
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:11,900
of people who were like let em fight

2155
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:13,900
or there were a lot of people who were like

2156
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:15,900
haha look at this isn't this funny?

2157
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:17,900
And in the process they

2158
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:19,900
passively or by

2159
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:21,900
amplifying and laughing

2160
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:23,900
at them making fun of

2161
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,900
Charlie Kirk aided

2162
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:27,900
in pushing and furthering

2163
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:29,900
Nick Fuentes' goals. So I

2164
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,900
think that this is probably if

2165
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:33,900
you're just trying to craft like

2166
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:35,900
what do we do next now that we know

2167
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:37,900
there's no chance this is gonna

2168
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:39,900
work out it's probably a sound thing to do.

2169
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:41,900
Well I mean I'm gonna

2170
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:43,900
I would say going back to their

2171
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:45,900
terrible military strategy and then

2172
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:47,900
update it for us here

2173
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:49,900
when your enemies are

2174
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:51,900
infighting it is a bad idea to

2175
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:53,900
just let them watch or to just

2176
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:55,900
watch it. That's when they're weakest. That's when

2177
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:57,900
you destroy both of them. You can't

2178
01:43:57,900 --> 01:43:59,900
allow them to regroup

2179
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,900
after defeating their inner

2180
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:03,900
struggle in order to become even worse.

2181
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:05,900
And the worst parts of

2182
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:07,900
it probably entrenched during

2183
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:09,900
that infighting. Then we saw

2184
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:11,900
that in 2009 onward

2185
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:13,900
with the Tea Party we are

2186
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:15,900
going to probably see that

2187
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:17,900
again unless and I don't know

2188
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:19,900
what you do like I don't you know I don't

2189
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:21,900
like to talk about crushing

2190
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:23,900
because I think that that's kind of

2191
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:25,900
I don't know violent imagery

2192
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:27,900
and I'm not super into that.

2193
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:29,900
I don't know what you do to push back against this

2194
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:31,900
stuff but I do agree with you like

2195
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:33,900
watching and laughing like haha they're

2196
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:35,900
destroying each other is not

2197
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:37,900
good when one of the parties that

2198
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:39,900
is doing the destroying is

2199
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:41,900
far more extreme than

2200
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:43,900
and that's not to say hey we should defend

2201
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:45,900
the mainline GOP. No.

2202
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:47,900
It's just that neither of those is a winning

2203
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:49,900
strategy. No I mean what we should do

2204
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:51,900
is what the right has always done

2205
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:53,900
successfully to the left and the center

2206
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:55,900
which is exacerbate

2207
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:57,900
whatever differences they have and force

2208
01:44:57,900 --> 01:44:59,900
them to destroy each other instead of just

2209
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:01,900
the right never sits back and watches

2210
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:03,900
us fight.

2211
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:05,900
Fair enough.

2212
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:07,900
But anyway Alex says he's going to take over

2213
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:09,900
the GOP which is what he said

2214
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:11,900
years ago and then he said he had and then

2215
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:13,900
Trump did and now I guess they're

2216
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:15,900
doing it again but

2217
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:17,900
this is so lucky.

2218
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:19,900
Nick starts talking about

2219
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:21,900
his view of America. Oh no.

2220
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:23,900
And the mic cuts out at

2221
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:25,900
exactly the right time. Yeah I would imagine

2222
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:27,900
so. You know who the rhinos are and we're

2223
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:29,900
taking over the party. We are the people

2224
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:31,900
we are the populist movement. How would you describe

2225
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:33,900
the new right

2226
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:35,900
or just the new populist?

2227
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:37,900
Nazis. Well I call it America first

2228
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:39,900
because what distinguishes us

2229
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:41,900
from them is our interpretation

2230
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:43,900
of what is America. In our view

2231
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:45,900
what constitutes America is the American

2232
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:47,900
people. It's not America

2233
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:49,900
as its economy. It's not America

2234
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:51,900
as its government. It's not America.

2235
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:55,900
It's not America.

2236
01:45:55,900 --> 01:45:57,900
Alright we are

2237
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:59,900
live right now.

2238
01:45:59,900 --> 01:46:01,900
We have Alex Jones and Nick Fuentes

2239
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:03,900
our

2240
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:05,900
transmission there. Our connection has been

2241
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:07,900
interrupted. We will get them potted up.

2242
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:09,900
If I were a producer and I were watching

2243
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:11,900
this and I knew who Nick Fuentes was

2244
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:13,900
exactly. I'm not saying that's what happened.

2245
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:15,900
Red button! Red button as soon as he can!

2246
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:17,900
He's about to say it's not America the republic!

2247
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:19,900
Stop it! Red button! He's about to say it's not

2248
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:21,900
America the country! If he's left

2249
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:23,900
to talk about what he believes the

2250
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:25,900
American people are

2251
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:27,900
it's going to become

2252
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:29,900
a little blunt what his beliefs

2253
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:31,900
are. I'm not saying that someone

2254
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:33,900
did hit the red button or anything. There's

2255
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:35,900
equally possible that their tech issues

2256
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:37,900
just suck so much. More possible. But if

2257
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:39,900
I were there I would have done exactly that.

2258
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:41,900
Totally. Because you can't risk

2259
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:43,900
like that

2260
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:45,900
game getting blown up.

2261
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,900
You're just waiting for them to be like

2262
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:49,900
and we're going to round up

2263
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:51,900
all the people with mental health issues

2264
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:53,900
and put them in the...

2265
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:55,900
Who hit the red button?

2266
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:57,900
Exactly. All immigrants have to go

2267
01:46:57,900 --> 01:46:59,900
and okay.

2268
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:01,900
Well. Yep. Yep. Anyway

2269
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:03,900
I thought that maybe that

2270
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:05,900
trucker strike thing that Nick was talking about

2271
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:07,900
was just trying to rile up the crowd.

2272
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:09,900
It turns out he really

2273
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:11,900
is in support of this. Which is weird.

2274
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:13,900
That is weird. But then it's weirder

2275
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:15,900
that Alex is too. Okay. Fuck off.

2276
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:17,900
And I'll tell you I really like what I'm seeing

2277
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:19,900
with this trucker strike that they're planning

2278
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:21,900
later this month. I was about to say I've been meaning to

2279
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:23,900
promote that for a week.

2280
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:25,900
If the trucker strike, especially on the east coast

2281
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:27,900
is shut down. They should shut down blue states

2282
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:29,900
and blue cities. Hey you're shutting us down with the COVID

2283
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:31,900
hugs. We're shutting you down. And they

2284
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:33,900
should come to Georgia and other state capitals and

2285
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:35,900
just drive around honking the whole

2286
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:37,900
time. In fact truckers I'm calling for you

2287
01:47:37,900 --> 01:47:39,900
on Thursday, Friday and Saturday here

2288
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:41,900
at noon every day. Drive around

2289
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:43,900
the

2290
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:45,900
the capital honking your

2291
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:47,900
horns. Honk for us.

2292
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:49,900
Nick is a child so I'm less interested

2293
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:51,900
in his political philosophy making coherent sense.

2294
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:53,900
Sure. Alex on the other hand should

2295
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:55,900
definitely not be in favor of a strike

2296
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:57,900
just because he likes the goal of it.

2297
01:47:57,900 --> 01:47:59,900
The means that's being used to achieve

2298
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:01,900
the goal is the withholding of labor in an

2299
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:03,900
organized fashion, which he totally

2300
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:05,900
hates. It's interesting and kind

2301
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:07,900
of ironic why this plan that Nick

2302
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:09,900
is so keen on would never work.

2303
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,900
The biggest reason is deregulation

2304
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:13,900
and union busting in the shipping and trucking

2305
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:15,900
sector. According to Snopes there

2306
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:17,900
used to be two million truckers who were

2307
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:19,900
members of the Teamsters and now there are

2308
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:21,900
only 75,000. Great.

2309
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:23,900
The institutional power that truckers had in the

2310
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:25,900
70s from banding together and keeping

2311
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:27,900
those unions strong has disappeared, largely

2312
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:29,900
due to political influence of

2313
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:31,900
people who Nick and Alex would be largely

2314
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:33,900
in agreement with, at least as far as labor

2315
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:35,900
issues go. God. There is

2316
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:37,900
often big talk about

2317
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:39,900
truckers striking because it brings to mind

2318
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:41,900
a complete shutdown of food distribution

2319
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:43,900
and the myriad issues that come along with it,

2320
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:45,900
but the sad reality is that these

2321
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:47,900
strikes don't really end up having any

2322
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:49,900
real impact because they can't.

2323
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:51,900
If you're a trucker and you want a strike

2324
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:53,900
are you going to get the Teamsters to strike

2325
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:55,900
to install Trump as president?

2326
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:57,900
Do you really think that's going to work?

2327
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:59,900
That's probably never going to happen

2328
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:01,900
so if you're working in a union shop

2329
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:03,900
that's not going to be a strike, that's going to

2330
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:05,900
be you quitting. If you're an

2331
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:07,900
independent trucker or maybe you work for a

2332
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:09,900
smaller outfit that's theoretically on board

2333
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:11,900
with this strike, you probably can't afford

2334
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:13,900
to do it because there's no protection for

2335
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:15,900
you. You have no weight to throw

2336
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:17,900
around by withholding your labor since

2337
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:19,900
whoever's hiring you can just hire somebody

2338
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:21,900
else. If those tomatoes need to

2339
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:23,900
get to Kansas and you're on strike to install

2340
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:25,900
your fantasy king, great, good for

2341
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:27,900
you, you're fired, and this other truck

2342
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:29,900
is going to get paid to haul those tomatoes.

2343
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:31,900
The only way this kind of

2344
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:33,900
strategy could work is ironically

2345
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:35,900
if the world was exactly how Alex

2346
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:37,900
and Nick don't want it to be.

2347
01:49:37,900 --> 01:49:39,900
If the trucker's union was strong and

2348
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:41,900
everyone in it could vote to stop work because

2349
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:43,900
they felt the election was stolen, it would be

2350
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:45,900
super fucked up but they could make a pretty huge

2351
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:47,900
statement. The political movement

2352
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:49,900
that Alex and Nick are a part of has actually

2353
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:51,900
ensured that this can never

2354
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:53,900
really happen. It is because

2355
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:55,900
it's clearly them being like, well we would

2356
01:49:55,900 --> 01:49:57,900
love unions if they agreed with us

2357
01:49:57,900 --> 01:49:59,900
and for some reason we can't get unions

2358
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:01,900
to agree that we should destroy unions

2359
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:03,900
and I just don't get it!

2360
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:05,900
Honestly, even if this could

2361
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:07,900
possibly happen, this idea,

2362
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:09,900
it doesn't matter. On this

2363
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:11,900
day, when this episode is recorded, November

2364
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:13,900
18th, the guy who organized this

2365
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:15,900
strike called it off.

2366
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:17,900
Probably because it was an absurd idea

2367
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:19,900
that would only hurt the participants and achieve

2368
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:21,900
literally nothing. Well there is that.

2369
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:23,900
Yeah, I'm fascinated by

2370
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:25,900
this abdication of their

2371
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:27,900
political beliefs though.

2372
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:29,900
I don't understand it. Their political

2373
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:31,900
beliefs are we will do anything

2374
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:33,900
to get what we want. So

2375
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:35,900
that's why it always gets to me

2376
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:37,900
whenever somebody's like, oh Mitch McConnell's

2377
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:39,900
a hypocrite or any of that bullshit.

2378
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:41,900
Their only political belief

2379
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:43,900
is here is the thing that I want

2380
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:45,900
and I will do anything to get it.

2381
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:47,900
So there's no possible way for them to

2382
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:49,900
be hypocritical in this fashion.

2383
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:51,900
You know? That's their belief system.

2384
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:53,900
I understand that with

2385
01:50:53,900 --> 01:50:55,900
people like Mitch McConnell.

2386
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:57,900
I know that Alex

2387
01:50:57,900 --> 01:50:59,900
isn't any better but his brand is supposed

2388
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:01,900
to be that he's better. His brand is

2389
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:03,900
supposed to be, yeah, exactly.

2390
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:05,900
I understand. And that's why it's just

2391
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:07,900
kind of weird to me that like

2392
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:09,900
I get it

2393
01:51:09,900 --> 01:51:11,900
but I don't get how you

2394
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:13,900
don't get it. Not you.

2395
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:15,900
No no no, I know. I know.

2396
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:17,900
Anyway, Alex's traffic is way up because

2397
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:19,900
of course it is. Because of course it is. During these sorts of periods

2398
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:21,900
Alex ends up getting much more

2399
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:23,900
traffic I think a lot of the times because people

2400
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:25,900
want to see him drunk and crying or something.

2401
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:27,900
There's a lot of potential

2402
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:29,900
for something. And he said

2403
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:31,900
this a couple times in the last couple

2404
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:33,900
weeks. That traffic is way

2405
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:35,900
up and no one's buying anything.

2406
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:37,900
And that's sort of characteristic of either

2407
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:39,900
artificial traffic or people

2408
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:41,900
tuning in to be like, oh

2409
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:43,900
something bad is going to happen. Yeah, we saw that

2410
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:45,900
multiple times. Multiple times.

2411
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:47,900
He's like, traffic is so, it's

2412
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:49,900
triple the size but people aren't buying anything

2413
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:51,900
and I just don't, yeah.

2414
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:53,900
We are seeing four or five times the traffic

2415
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:55,900
on the side. It's pissing off the

2416
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:57,900
public. They don't know what to do. They've got

2417
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,900
feds, FBI that come in the restaurant

2418
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:01,900
sit down every morning we eat breakfast.

2419
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:03,900
They put CIA stickers on our car

2420
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:05,900
even in locked up garages. And they

2421
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:07,900
just want us to know they're watching. Of course we know

2422
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:09,900
that you're helping guide in the

2423
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:11,900
end of America and the merger with the New World Order

2424
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:13,900
because it's going to be peaceful and good.

2425
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:15,900
But it's not. They're coming to sterilize our sons.

2426
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:17,900
They're coming with 5G. They're coming to fry us and kill us.

2427
01:52:17,900 --> 01:52:19,900
That's their own damn admissions. They're going to depopulate

2428
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:21,900
us. And so all you FBI agents remember

2429
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:23,900
you're going to be thrown

2430
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:25,900
to the wind just like all these

2431
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:27,900
tyrants do. You're destroying America.

2432
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:29,900
You're destroying everything. So I feel good

2433
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:31,900
about what I'm doing and I'm not threatened and I'm not intimidated.

2434
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:33,900
So I have a hundred feds follow us if you want.

2435
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:35,900
You work for the shy comms and if you don't stand

2436
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:37,900
with us you have that on your conscience. You have

2437
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:39,900
God to face and God's real and God's

2438
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:41,900
the real judge. We'll be right back. Wow.

2439
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:43,900
Whoa boy. That's something.

2440
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:45,900
That's intense. Yeah.

2441
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:47,900
That's a bit. Alex's traffic is way

2442
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:49,900
up and the feds are

2443
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:51,900
following him and putting CIA stickers

2444
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:53,900
on his car. I wrote that down. I'm confused

2445
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:55,900
as to why they would do that.

2446
01:52:55,900 --> 01:52:57,900
Is that just a

2447
01:52:57,900 --> 01:52:59,900
gentle reminder? Hey guys.

2448
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:01,900
We're watching. Just to let you know.

2449
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:03,900
We can put a sticker on your car anytime

2450
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:05,900
we want. Yeah.

2451
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:07,900
I don't know if

2452
01:53:07,900 --> 01:53:09,900
the CIA isn't a prank. Do you think

2453
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:11,900
it might be a bunch of kids?

2454
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:13,900
It certainly could be. I mean I think

2455
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:15,900
that or it could be people who used to

2456
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:17,900
like Alex and now have decided he's a shill

2457
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:19,900
or something. Could be. Or like you're in the CIA

2458
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:21,900
we're going to label your car. Yeah.

2459
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:23,900
I mean or it didn't happen at all in

2460
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:25,900
Alex's imagination. Oh that's a possibility.

2461
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:27,900
He's just making all this up. He's just making up a bunch

2462
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:29,900
of bullshit. Yeah. Any of these things are possible

2463
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:31,900
but what I think is not possible

2464
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:33,900
is that the feds are following him

2465
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:35,900
around Atlanta and putting CIA buttons

2466
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:37,900
on his stickers on his car. Would you say that it's not possible

2467
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:39,900
for the FBI to

2468
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:41,900
be going around and putting CIA

2469
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:43,900
stickers on Alex's stuff? I find it

2470
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:45,900
implausible. Where would they even get those stickers?

2471
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:47,900
I don't know if they exist. Exactly. So

2472
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:49,900
Alex gets in this next clip to what I

2473
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:51,900
think might be possibly his

2474
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:53,900
big news but it just makes no sense that

2475
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:55,900
this would be the big news.

2476
01:53:55,900 --> 01:53:57,900
We're here. I've got big news as I said.

2477
01:53:57,900 --> 01:53:59,900
The Austro-Hungarian empire. I want to start

2478
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:01,900
getting into it now. The freedom

2479
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:03,900
streak of those of us that were pro-Trump

2480
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:05,900
pro-America. We don't

2481
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:07,900
go away just if they steal this election from Trump.

2482
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:09,900
And it's the fighting

2483
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:11,900
the fraudulent election

2484
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:13,900
that puts us in position to absolutely

2485
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:15,900
now if you thought Trump put a

2486
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:17,900
big dent in the New World Order.

2487
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:19,900
We're just getting started. Trump is just one way.

2488
01:54:19,900 --> 01:54:21,900
So I guess his big

2489
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:23,900
news is that

2490
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:25,900
Trump isn't the end. Which is not

2491
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:27,900
news. That doesn't sound like news at all.

2492
01:54:27,900 --> 01:54:29,900
It's not big. Especially considering

2493
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:31,900
he said it in 2016 before Trump won

2494
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:33,900
the election. He was like, listen, here's the major

2495
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:35,900
victory for us. Trump isn't

2496
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:37,900
the end of things. Yeah, this is just

2497
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:39,900
a step along the way. Exactly.

2498
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:41,900
I don't know. If there was some

2499
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:43,900
sort of actual big news, it's not

2500
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:45,900
gotten to at all.

2501
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:47,900
It's just that we keep on fighting

2502
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:49,900
and what have you. Sure, sure, sure.

2503
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:51,900
And then Nick phrases this in such a

2504
01:54:51,900 --> 01:54:53,900
weird way. But it's actually not that weird.

2505
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:55,900
It's really revealing.

2506
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:57,900
What they've done is they've disenfranchised

2507
01:54:57,900 --> 01:54:59,900
73 million Trump supporters.

2508
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:01,900
The president gained

2509
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:03,900
10 million voters between 2016

2510
01:55:03,900 --> 01:55:05,900
and 2020. There's more Trump supporters

2511
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:07,900
than ever. There's more patriots than ever

2512
01:55:07,900 --> 01:55:09,900
that are aware of globalism. The idea

2513
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:11,900
that stealing the election from us

2514
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:13,900
and canceling our votes and disenfranchising

2515
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:15,900
70-some million people

2516
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:17,900
that we go away after all

2517
01:55:17,900 --> 01:55:19,900
of that, if they just get through,

2518
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:21,900
you know, they speed through the process, they

2519
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:23,900
see Joe Biden, do they think then that

2520
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:25,900
we just disappear into thin air?

2521
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:27,900
Losing an election is not the same thing

2522
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:29,900
as being disenfranchised. But this

2523
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:31,900
is actually a really neat moment of clarity

2524
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:33,900
for Nick, because it is the

2525
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:35,900
same thing to him. He believes that

2526
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:37,900
he's entitled to win everything, whether it

2527
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:39,900
be due to the color of his skin or his

2528
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:41,900
radical Catholicism. This is

2529
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:43,900
the same mentality you hear

2530
01:55:43,900 --> 01:55:45,900
in that tape of Richard Spencer that Milo

2531
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:47,900
released. In his rant,

2532
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:49,900
Spencer said, quote,

2533
01:55:49,900 --> 01:55:51,900
like, this is never over. I win. They fucking

2534
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:53,900
lose. That's how the world fucking works.

2535
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:55,900
Little fucking Ks.

2536
01:55:55,900 --> 01:55:57,900
They get ruled by people like me.

2537
01:55:57,900 --> 01:55:59,900
My ancestors fucking enslaved

2538
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:01,900
those little pieces of fucking shit.

2539
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:03,900
I rule the fucking world. Those pieces

2540
01:56:03,900 --> 01:56:05,900
of fucking shit get ruled over, ruled

2541
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:07,900
by people like me. They look up

2542
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:09,900
and see a face like mine looking down at

2543
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:11,900
them. This audio was allegedly

2544
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:13,900
recorded the day after the Unite

2545
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:15,900
the Right rally in 2017,

2546
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:17,900
which Nick Fuentes took part in.

2547
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:19,900
It's not hard to understand

2548
01:56:19,900 --> 01:56:21,900
that underneath whatever slick presentation

2549
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:23,900
folks like Nick have, that rage of entitlement

2550
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:25,900
is just below the surface.

2551
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:27,900
It makes total sense for him to claim that

2552
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:29,900
losing an election is disenfranchising

2553
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:31,900
his side because he's entitled to

2554
01:56:31,900 --> 01:56:33,900
win. Would he ever think that

2555
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:35,900
all the people who voted for Hillary in 2016

2556
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:37,900
were disenfranchised? No, of course not.

2557
01:56:37,900 --> 01:56:39,900
Because they're entitled to lose

2558
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:41,900
to someone like him. They're globalists

2559
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:43,900
and they're evil and they should be

2560
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:45,900
Yeah, it's very, it's very

2561
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:47,900
fucked up. It's exactly what they

2562
01:56:47,900 --> 01:56:49,900
Yeah, they want a, well, I mean, if you want

2563
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:51,900
a homogenous nation, then the idea

2564
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:53,900
that losing

2565
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:55,900
an election is possible is kind of silly.

2566
01:56:55,900 --> 01:56:57,900
True. And

2567
01:56:57,900 --> 01:56:59,900
I mean, like,

2568
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:01,900
he's not going to be pressed on this on Infowars

2569
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:03,900
because Alex doesn't want to open up this

2570
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:05,900
box of worms, but

2571
01:57:05,900 --> 01:57:07,900
I mean, he believes that people who have, like,

2572
01:57:07,900 --> 01:57:09,900
immigrated here shouldn't

2573
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:11,900
vote and stuff. Nick, Nick, I have

2574
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:13,900
a couple of quick questions for you.

2575
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:15,900
Do you want a white nation?

2576
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:17,900
Wow! Okay,

2577
01:57:17,900 --> 01:57:19,900
follow-up question. Have you ever

2578
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:21,900
heard of what happens to people who don't have

2579
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:23,900
quote, pure blood in a white

2580
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:25,900
nation? I've heard, I've- Nick Fuentes.

2581
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:27,900
Yes, I've heard. Have you heard

2582
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:29,900
what happens to people who

2583
01:57:29,900 --> 01:57:31,900
do not have pure blood?

2584
01:57:31,900 --> 01:57:33,900
That's a point that comes up

2585
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:35,900
in a number of discussions that he's had

2586
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:37,900
that I've seen. The point

2587
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:39,900
about his last name being Fuentes.

2588
01:57:39,900 --> 01:57:41,900
Um, and

2589
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:43,900
I don't know, I don't know, I don't think

2590
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:45,900
he really deals with that. I don't think he wants to.

2591
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:47,900
No. No. Anyway,

2592
01:57:47,900 --> 01:57:49,900
I think it's interesting

2593
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:51,900
that, you know,

2594
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:53,900
this is all very revealing.

2595
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:55,900
This, the conversation

2596
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:57,900
that they're having, whether it be

2597
01:57:57,900 --> 01:57:59,900
Owen being like, yeah,

2598
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:01,900
mob violence, they deserve it.

2599
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:03,900
Yep, hey, they have it coming. Okay.

2600
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:05,900
Trump gave them an ephemeral

2601
01:58:05,900 --> 01:58:07,900
chance that they had no idea was happening

2602
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:09,900
because he put it in a court

2603
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:11,900
filing where he said

2604
01:58:11,900 --> 01:58:13,900
that demons were flying in

2605
01:58:13,900 --> 01:58:15,900
from Stargates to shit on our shoes.

2606
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:17,900
Pretty blunt. All

2607
01:58:17,900 --> 01:58:19,900
of their specific points that they're making

2608
01:58:19,900 --> 01:58:21,900
about these, the various

2609
01:58:21,900 --> 01:58:23,900
states are nonsensical.

2610
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:25,900
You know, Nick is just

2611
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:27,900
talking about taking over the

2612
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:29,900
GOP. I think he's probably

2613
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:31,900
is the most singular focus. Yeah.

2614
01:58:31,900 --> 01:58:33,900
And I don't know if he actually believes

2615
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:35,900
this or he knows that Alex believes

2616
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:37,900
it and therefore it's best to

2617
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:39,900
play into Alex's beliefs.

2618
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:41,900
But he's presenting himself as also

2619
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:43,900
fighting the literal devil. Sure.

2620
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:45,900
We're fighting a spiritual war.

2621
01:58:45,900 --> 01:58:47,900
You know, don't forget, it's not about on some level

2622
01:58:47,900 --> 01:58:49,900
even Republicans and Democrats or

2623
01:58:49,900 --> 01:58:51,900
globalists and people, although it is

2624
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:53,900
in some sense, it is about the

2625
01:58:53,900 --> 01:58:55,900
rulers and the principalities

2626
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:57,900
of other realms, evil

2627
01:58:57,900 --> 01:58:59,900
versus good. That's what it's always been.

2628
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:01,900
Other realms, other dimensions. The Bible's right.

2629
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:03,900
Yeah. So I don't know if Nick

2630
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:05,900
actually believes that or if he's

2631
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:07,900
doing this to manipulate Alex. Sure.

2632
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:09,900
Either is possible. But also

2633
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:11,900
you see that Republicans or

2634
01:59:11,900 --> 01:59:13,900
Democrats, globalists or

2635
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:15,900
people. Yep. That's the dichotomy

2636
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:17,900
there. That's strange.

2637
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:19,900
No, he's genuinely one

2638
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:21,900
of those truly terrifying psychopaths.

2639
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:23,900
You know? Yeah.

2640
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:25,900
Like, he's a guy who

2641
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:27,900
provides you, I would

2642
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:29,900
say that 99% of the people

2643
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:31,900
in the world you can actually

2644
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:33,900
talk to. They're reasonable people.

2645
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:35,900
But guys like Nick Fuentes are

2646
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:37,900
that argument for like, you can't

2647
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:39,900
talk to this. He's a

2648
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:41,900
terrifying psychopath. Yeah, like a couple months ago.

2649
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:43,900
This can only be handled by a

2650
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:45,900
larger power, you know?

2651
01:59:45,900 --> 01:59:47,900
Like a federal, or like a

2652
01:59:47,900 --> 01:59:49,900
law, not God, obviously.

2653
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:51,900
Like a level of

2654
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:53,900
something, somebody needs to step in

2655
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:55,900
because this isn't a like

2656
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:57,900
one-on-one conversation that you can have with

2657
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:59,900
Nick Fuentes. If you or someone in his life

2658
01:59:59,900 --> 02:00:01,900
you might want to try and like get him help.

2659
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:03,900
Yeah. I mean like a couple months ago he got

2660
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:05,900
he posted a video of him

2661
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:07,900
going to like troll a Black Lives Matter

2662
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:09,900
protest. Yeah. Where like

2663
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:11,900
he had one of his friends had a sign that said, I can't

2664
02:00:11,900 --> 02:00:13,900
read. Yeah. Like parodying

2665
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:15,900
I can't breathe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's the type of

2666
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:17,900
person who does shit like that. Yeah. Like that's

2667
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:19,900
just like, take the political stuff

2668
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:21,900
out of it. Take the, take anything

2669
02:00:21,900 --> 02:00:23,900
out of it. It's just

2670
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:25,900
antisocial

2671
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:27,900
disgusting behavior. Mm-hmm. And

2672
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:29,900
I don't know. Anyway

2673
02:00:29,900 --> 02:00:31,900
I think that what we saw a little bit

2674
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:33,900
in that CPAC appearance is sort of

2675
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:35,900
continuing.

2676
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:37,900
It's not been as consistent

2677
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:39,900
or direct as it appeared

2678
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:41,900
it might be. Mm-hmm. Because it did appear that

2679
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:43,900
Nick Fuentes was kind of trying to

2680
02:00:43,900 --> 02:00:45,900
like usurp.

2681
02:00:45,900 --> 02:00:47,900
Say a little bit. A little bit. Yeah.

2682
02:00:47,900 --> 02:00:49,900
And I think that he's taking up

2683
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:51,900
a mantle here as more of

2684
02:00:51,900 --> 02:00:53,900
like actual leader

2685
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:55,900
than Alex. Yeah. And that's kind

2686
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:57,900
of scary but also like what are you going to

2687
02:00:57,900 --> 02:00:59,900
lead? Alex's kingdom

2688
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:01,900
is illusory. Yeah. He doesn't really exist.

2689
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:03,900
Yeah. That's the thing that I

2690
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:05,900
was wondering. Like what do you want to be?

2691
02:01:05,900 --> 02:01:07,900
The next Owen Troyer? Good luck. No. I mean

2692
02:01:07,900 --> 02:01:09,900
we saw this on, his ambition is

2693
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:11,900
clearly far outside. Way higher. Yeah.

2694
02:01:11,900 --> 02:01:13,900
Yeah. Way, way higher than being

2695
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:15,900
a second in command to Alex. Yeah.

2696
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:17,900
Which is kind of why. His project

2697
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:19,900
involves using Infowars.

2698
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:21,900
Exactly. Not being a part of it.

2699
02:01:21,900 --> 02:01:23,900
As a stepping stone. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

2700
02:01:23,900 --> 02:01:25,900
He probably is almost even embarrassed that they

2701
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:27,900
are the sort of people he has to use. He still has to.

2702
02:01:27,900 --> 02:01:29,900
Yeah, yeah. As soon as he gets outside

2703
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:31,900
of their level he's not, he's not a

2704
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:33,900
ladder up guy. Mm-mm.

2705
02:01:33,900 --> 02:01:35,900
Uh-uh. No.

2706
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:37,900
Owen who? What was the

2707
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:39,900
what was the name of the event

2708
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:41,900
that they went to? The RNC

2709
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:43,900
remember

2710
02:01:43,900 --> 02:01:45,900
when Alex got super drunk and couldn't give a

2711
02:01:45,900 --> 02:01:47,900
The deplorer ball? The deplorer ball when he couldn't even give his own

2712
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:49,900
keynote speech. Yeah. Yeah.

2713
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:51,900
Was that the one where? No, no, no. You're talking about

2714
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:53,900
CPAC. Yeah. The deplorer ball is where he got really

2715
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:55,900
drunk and peed on a tree. Yeah, that was a different one.

2716
02:01:55,900 --> 02:01:57,900
Yeah. Oh, good

2717
02:01:57,900 --> 02:01:59,900
time. Yeah. No, at

2718
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:01,900
CPAC whenever Fuentes showed

2719
02:02:01,900 --> 02:02:03,900
up and clearly stole the show from him

2720
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:05,900
Mm-hmm. Like even then my first thought is

2721
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:07,900
like Alex, this is not

2722
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:09,900
somebody that you can use.

2723
02:02:09,900 --> 02:02:11,900
This is somebody you should watch out

2724
02:02:11,900 --> 02:02:13,900
for. Yeah. This is somebody who's gunning

2725
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:15,900
for you and if you can't see that

2726
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:17,900
you're insane to me. Mm-hmm. You know?

2727
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:19,900
Yeah, but Alex and him can

2728
02:02:19,900 --> 02:02:21,900
coexist as long as he follows

2729
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:23,900
Nick. Sure. Yeah, like I agree.

2730
02:02:23,900 --> 02:02:25,900
And if the next season

2731
02:02:25,900 --> 02:02:27,900
and the next project is

2732
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:29,900
destroying the GOP who won't

2733
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:31,900
bend to their extremist

2734
02:02:31,900 --> 02:02:33,900
tea party will, then

2735
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:35,900
the two of them could have common cause and coexist

2736
02:02:35,900 --> 02:02:37,900
perfectly fine. Sure.

2737
02:02:37,900 --> 02:02:39,900
It's just once

2738
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:41,900
Fuentes in his like larger project

2739
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:43,900
leaning towards Catholic fascism

2740
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:45,900
Mm-hmm. Yeah. It becomes

2741
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:47,900
more apparent. That's where him and Alex

2742
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:49,900
might come to loggerheads.

2743
02:02:49,900 --> 02:02:51,900
Yeah. But that's a ways off.

2744
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:53,900
See, that's the thing though. If you're Alex, you

2745
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:55,900
have to see Nick Fuentes and

2746
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:57,900
realize two things. One,

2747
02:02:57,900 --> 02:02:59,900
it's, he's

2748
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:01,900
never going to bend to you. No.

2749
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:03,900
That's never going to happen. Uh-uh. And two,

2750
02:03:03,900 --> 02:03:05,900
there's only two ways that goes.

2751
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:07,900
Yep. You bend to him

2752
02:03:07,900 --> 02:03:09,900
and he disappears. Uh-huh. Those are the

2753
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:11,900
only options there. And when he's gone,

2754
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:13,900
when he disappears, uh-huh, he's planning

2755
02:03:13,900 --> 02:03:15,900
something against you. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

2756
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:17,900
Yes. What don't you understand about who

2757
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:19,900
you, why don't any of these people know who

2758
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:21,900
their friends are? Yeah. Every,

2759
02:03:21,900 --> 02:03:23,900
everybody who's run afoul

2760
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:25,900
of Roger Stone, Roger Stone has tried to

2761
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:27,900
destroy. Uh, yeah. You don't think he's

2762
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:29,900
going to do that again? Yeah. You don't, what do you think he's going to be like,

2763
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:31,900
well, I have some sentimental attachment to Alex.

2764
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:33,900
Yeah. Get the fuck out of here. He used to be friends

2765
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:35,900
with Larry Klayman.

2766
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:37,900
And we saw how that went. Exactly.

2767
02:03:37,900 --> 02:03:39,900
Yeah. It's not, don't,

2768
02:03:39,900 --> 02:03:41,900
don't, don't get involved.

2769
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:43,900
Ugh. So stupid. Yeah, and Nick

2770
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:45,900
Fuentes seems like, uh,

2771
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:47,900
I mean, like, just

2772
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:49,900
quite frankly, slick.

2773
02:03:49,900 --> 02:03:51,900
Yeah. Intelligent. Mm-hmm.

2774
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:53,900
Uh, able to- Razor focused.

2775
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:55,900
Yes. Razor focused. To a level

2776
02:03:55,900 --> 02:03:57,900
that you just don't see generally

2777
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:59,900
with people who are in the Info Wars here.

2778
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:01,900
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, like, obviously

2779
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:03,900
I agree with you. If I were Alex, I would be

2780
02:04:03,900 --> 02:04:05,900
terrified of him. Yeah. And work

2781
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:07,900
to pretend- I would be trying to destroy him.

2782
02:04:07,900 --> 02:04:09,900
I would, either that or pretend he doesn't exist.

2783
02:04:09,900 --> 02:04:11,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah. One of the two. Totally.

2784
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:13,900
But Alex can't because

2785
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:15,900
Nick is fairly popular

2786
02:04:15,900 --> 02:04:17,900
in these right-wing worlds, and he has

2787
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:19,900
uh, you know, whatever

2788
02:04:19,900 --> 02:04:21,900
amount of juice that he does and

2789
02:04:21,900 --> 02:04:23,900
groipers and stuff, and Alex wants a piece of it.

2790
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:25,900
Yeah. It's just so weird to be

2791
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:27,900
watching a Greek tragedy happen

2792
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:29,900
and not have that, like, if you're

2793
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:31,900
watching a play and you're watching a Greek tragedy

2794
02:04:31,900 --> 02:04:33,900
you're like, man, those characters have no idea

2795
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:35,900
what's coming for them next. Well, see

2796
02:04:35,900 --> 02:04:37,900
but here's where I would take issue with that.

2797
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:39,900
It's the same thing with me saying that, like,

2798
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:41,900
Alex should only be in studio and Owen should

2799
02:04:41,900 --> 02:04:43,900
be his proxy. Sure. Like, that is what

2800
02:04:43,900 --> 02:04:45,900
they should do, and that is a way that it could

2801
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:47,900
play out and it's gonna be disappointing when it doesn't.

2802
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:49,900
Right. You looking at this as a Greek tragedy

2803
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:51,900
is also probably not how it's gonna

2804
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:53,900
play out. It's probably true. It's probably way less

2805
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:55,900
interesting, uh, than it is.

2806
02:04:55,900 --> 02:04:57,900
Yeah, that's probably true. Because people

2807
02:04:57,900 --> 02:04:59,900
develop and people change over time

2808
02:04:59,900 --> 02:05:01,900
and honestly, I think the most

2809
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:03,900
likely thing that's going to happen

2810
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:05,900
is that

2811
02:05:05,900 --> 02:05:07,900
Alex and

2812
02:05:07,900 --> 02:05:09,900
Nick will have some

2813
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:11,900
sort of an alliance and be able

2814
02:05:11,900 --> 02:05:13,900
to work together, attacking the GOP.

2815
02:05:13,900 --> 02:05:15,900
Yeah. And then, I don't

2816
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:17,900
know, Nick can't help himself.

2817
02:05:17,900 --> 02:05:19,900
He's also a fucking extreme troll.

2818
02:05:19,900 --> 02:05:21,900
He's a lunatic. He's gonna do something

2819
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:23,900
that ends up getting him kicked off

2820
02:05:23,900 --> 02:05:25,900
whatever streaming platform he's been relegated

2821
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:27,900
to now, or whatever.

2822
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:29,900
Like, he can't not push the

2823
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:31,900
envelope. Yeah, that's true. And he'll

2824
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:33,900
just be some sort of an extremist

2825
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:35,900
voice. Uh,

2826
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:37,900
next George Lincoln Rockwell or

2827
02:05:37,900 --> 02:05:39,900
some shit. Yeah, probably.

2828
02:05:39,900 --> 02:05:41,900
I just, uh, he's just one of those

2829
02:05:41,900 --> 02:05:43,900
guys who it seems like

2830
02:05:43,900 --> 02:05:45,900
he's that, like, dark

2831
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:47,900
candidate in the GOP

2832
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:49,900
that they cannot see coming.

2833
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:51,900
You know? Like, they just don't see him

2834
02:05:51,900 --> 02:05:53,900
coming. They think they're completely

2835
02:05:53,900 --> 02:05:55,900
different people, and then Nick

2836
02:05:55,900 --> 02:05:57,900
Fuentes is there and they realize they're Nick

2837
02:05:57,900 --> 02:05:59,900
Fuentes. I don't know. I don't think so.

2838
02:05:59,900 --> 02:06:01,900
I think that that's

2839
02:06:01,900 --> 02:06:03,900
writing a supervillain story

2840
02:06:03,900 --> 02:06:05,900
where only a shithead, like a

2841
02:06:05,900 --> 02:06:07,900
really dangerous shithead exists.

2842
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:09,900
We have a couple

2843
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:11,900
last clips here, and

2844
02:06:11,900 --> 02:06:13,900
they're just a little check-in

2845
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:15,900
on how Alex's operation

2846
02:06:15,900 --> 02:06:17,900
is going.

2847
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:19,900
He did a money bomb a little while ago,

2848
02:06:19,900 --> 02:06:21,900
and he made a lot of money from that.

2849
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:23,900
But then he also decided to

2850
02:06:23,900 --> 02:06:25,900
take a tank across the East Coast.

2851
02:06:25,900 --> 02:06:27,900
So that was a bad idea from a...

2852
02:06:27,900 --> 02:06:29,900
And then he's been flying all over the place

2853
02:06:29,900 --> 02:06:31,900
and he goes with, like, a large security detail

2854
02:06:31,900 --> 02:06:33,900
and then also has to broadcast

2855
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:35,900
remotely. Jesus.

2856
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:37,900
And apparently this hasn't been a great idea.

2857
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:57,900
He can't afford to do the nightly show now.

2858
02:06:57,900 --> 02:06:59,900
He just canceled it for a week.

2859
02:06:59,900 --> 02:07:05,900
Because I guess within a week he'll be back in Austin

2860
02:07:05,900 --> 02:07:07,900
and the, like, manpower

2861
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:09,900
will be able to

2862
02:07:09,900 --> 02:07:11,900
be moved. That's a thin

2863
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:13,900
operation. There is, like, no...

2864
02:07:13,900 --> 02:07:15,900
If there's no one else to run

2865
02:07:15,900 --> 02:07:17,900
the board, you can't afford to pay

2866
02:07:17,900 --> 02:07:19,900
someone, I don't know, 20 bucks an hour

2867
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:21,900
or something? You can't get

2868
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:23,900
someone on, like, some freelance person?

2869
02:07:23,900 --> 02:07:25,900
Guess not.

2870
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:27,900
Guess not. If that is the

2871
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:29,900
difference between, like,

2872
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:31,900
like, we have the money

2873
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:33,900
for it, we don't,

2874
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:35,900
that is a razor's edge.

2875
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:37,900
That's real bad. I don't know if that's

2876
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:39,900
actually true or not. I would assume that

2877
02:07:39,900 --> 02:07:41,900
it's just not worth it.

2878
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:43,900
Yeah, that would probably make the most sense too.

2879
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:45,900
Yeah. And it turns out it was

2880
02:07:45,900 --> 02:07:47,900
between that, cancel the nightly show

2881
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:49,900
or get rid of David Knight.

2882
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:51,900
It's just we don't have the forces

2883
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:53,900
to be able to have folks to run the shows.

2884
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:55,900
David Knight in the morning, Info Wars, my show

2885
02:07:55,900 --> 02:07:57,900
during the day, The War Room. I mean,

2886
02:07:57,900 --> 02:07:59,900
you know, which was it? Cancel the nighttime

2887
02:07:59,900 --> 02:08:01,900
show or cancel David Knight? Well,

2888
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:03,900
cancel David Knight. We love him. So,

2889
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:05,900
but if you get to a point where the funding gets cut,

2890
02:08:05,900 --> 02:08:07,900
David Knight goes away, or Ola goes away.

2891

2895
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:17,900
Sean Rappaport, NoMoreFakeNews.com

2896
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:19,900
taking over. God bless you all. We'll see you

2897
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:21,900
in Georgia at the State Capitol.

2898
02:08:21,900 --> 02:08:31,900
...

2899
02:08:31,900 --> 02:08:33,900
...

2900
02:08:33,900 --> 02:08:35,900
Oh, here she comes.

2901
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:37,900
Watch out boys, she'll chew you up.

2902
02:08:37,900 --> 02:08:39,900
It takes zero for us to suddenly

2903
02:08:39,900 --> 02:08:41,900
just start jamming a little bit.

2904
02:08:41,900 --> 02:08:43,900
Look, it's totally lit. It's brutal.

2905
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:45,900
Brutal shift.

2906
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:47,900
I have no... We're all gonna die.

2907
02:08:47,900 --> 02:08:49,900
I have no confidence

2908
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:51,900
in the staying power of my organization

2909
02:08:51,900 --> 02:08:53,900
and I had to fire someone

2910
02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:55,900
whether it be the nightly show or

2911
02:08:55,900 --> 02:08:57,900
beloved David Knight and hey, you know what,

2912
02:08:57,900 --> 02:08:59,900
if we don't get money, Owen might be gone.

2913
02:08:59,900 --> 02:09:01,900
Get the fuck out of here Owen. Anyway, here's

2914
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:03,900
Hall and Oates.

2915
02:09:03,900 --> 02:09:05,900
Here's a jaunty

2916
02:09:05,900 --> 02:09:07,900
sax outro for the show.

2917
02:09:07,900 --> 02:09:09,900
It's very, very jarring.

2918
02:09:09,900 --> 02:09:11,900
Oh man, they just heard us.

2919
02:09:11,900 --> 02:09:13,900
I've learned long ago, or

2920
02:09:13,900 --> 02:09:15,900
maybe I should have learned long ago and

2921
02:09:15,900 --> 02:09:17,900
learned fairly recently not to take anything

2922
02:09:17,900 --> 02:09:19,900
at face value with Alex's

2923
02:09:19,900 --> 02:09:21,900
financial talks.

2924
02:09:21,900 --> 02:09:23,900
So this may mean something, it may

2925
02:09:23,900 --> 02:09:25,900
just be a desperate ploy for money.

2926
02:09:25,900 --> 02:09:27,900
I don't know, but if

2927
02:09:27,900 --> 02:09:29,900
the nightly show is canceled for a week

2928
02:09:29,900 --> 02:09:31,900
because Alex is in Georgia, that

2929
02:09:31,900 --> 02:09:33,900
is not inspiring confidence in terms

2930
02:09:33,900 --> 02:09:35,900
of... Maybe Deanna

2931
02:09:35,900 --> 02:09:37,900
Lorraine just sucks. I mean, she does.

2932
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:39,900
She does! So maybe they're just

2933
02:09:39,900 --> 02:09:41,900
creating a fake reason to be like Deanna.

2934
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:43,900
You suck.

2935
02:09:43,900 --> 02:09:45,900
Yeah, we need to find a character for her.

2936
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:47,900
I'm not sure what it would be. I haven't watched

2937
02:09:47,900 --> 02:09:49,900
enough of her to really know what character

2938
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:51,900
she would shine as in the way that

2939
02:09:51,900 --> 02:09:53,900
Owen as the proxy on the street

2940
02:09:53,900 --> 02:09:55,900
Joe Biggs as the mechanic.

2941
02:09:55,900 --> 02:09:57,900
Monochromatic snatch.

2942
02:09:57,900 --> 02:09:59,900
Oh, I see what you did there. Thank you.

2943
02:09:59,900 --> 02:10:01,900
No.

2944
02:10:01,900 --> 02:10:03,900
No.

2945
02:10:03,900 --> 02:10:05,900
There's nothing better than

2946
02:10:05,900 --> 02:10:07,900
making a little joke and having somebody

2947
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:09,900
say, I see what you did

2948
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:11,900
there. I just don't think that that

2949
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:13,900
conception of a character was any good.

2950
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:15,900
No, it was not. The parody of

2951
02:10:15,900 --> 02:10:17,900
the social justice warrior

2952
02:10:17,900 --> 02:10:19,900
archetype or whatever, it just

2953
02:10:19,900 --> 02:10:21,900
had no legs. Even a good

2954
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:23,900
performer couldn't have pulled that off. I would say

2955
02:10:23,900 --> 02:10:25,900
don't try and retread those boards. That's a bad

2956
02:10:25,900 --> 02:10:27,900
idea. Yeah, I don't know.

2957
02:10:27,900 --> 02:10:29,900
Whatever. We'll see

2958
02:10:29,900 --> 02:10:31,900
what happens. Anyway, I was a little

2959
02:10:31,900 --> 02:10:33,900
disappointed by Alex in Georgia.

2960
02:10:33,900 --> 02:10:35,900
Just as a whole, I

2961
02:10:35,900 --> 02:10:37,900
think that it was refreshing

2962
02:10:37,900 --> 02:10:39,900
to hear him yelling in a bullhorn

2963
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:41,900
and people yelling back. Yeah, that's great.

2964
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:43,900
Getting people excited. That's good stuff. But you also

2965
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:45,900
notice once you watch enough

2966
02:10:45,900 --> 02:10:47,900
of it that it's like, this is really one note.

2967
02:10:47,900 --> 02:10:49,900
Yeah. It's just that over and over again

2968
02:10:49,900 --> 02:10:51,900
yelling the same catch phrases, the

2969
02:10:51,900 --> 02:10:53,900
same sort of

2970
02:10:53,900 --> 02:10:55,900
little blurbs.

2971
02:10:55,900 --> 02:10:57,900
You wanna fight? You better believe you

2972
02:10:57,900 --> 02:10:59,900
got one! And then everyone yells, yay!

2973
02:10:59,900 --> 02:11:01,900
It's like him yelling his get-er-done

2974
02:11:01,900 --> 02:11:03,900
or whatever. It's kind of,

2975
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:05,900
it wears on in a way that

2976
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:07,900
you shouldn't be in Georgia for multiple days.

2977
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:09,900
You should just be there

2978
02:11:09,900 --> 02:11:11,900
for a sting and then

2979
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:13,900
get back to the fucking studio where you're needed.

2980
02:11:13,900 --> 02:11:15,900
Yep, yep. But

2981
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:17,900
you know, it didn't work out.

2982
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:19,900
No. Georgia did not work for

2983
02:11:19,900 --> 02:11:21,900
Alex. Again. Yes. Again.

2984
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:23,900
And this is coming out on Monday, so we'll know

2985
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:25,900
for sure, you know, the certification

2986
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:27,900
status. Yeah.

2987
02:11:27,900 --> 02:11:29,900
But does not, oh I'm sorry,

2988
02:11:29,900 --> 02:11:31,900
I mean with Michigan. Yes. If they were talking about that earlier.

2989
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:33,900
They were talking about Michigan. Pardon me, yeah. So we'll see you on

2990
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:35,900
that one.

2991
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:37,900
And I don't know, I just, I think this is

2992
02:11:37,900 --> 02:11:39,900
going to fizzle, and they're going to need to find

2993
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:41,900
themselves on more solid ground.

2994
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:43,900
And it appears to me that solid ground, if

2995
02:11:43,900 --> 02:11:45,900
they're smart, is

2996
02:11:45,900 --> 02:11:47,900
a new

2997
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:49,900
Tea Party thing.

2998
02:11:49,900 --> 02:11:51,900
Attacking the GOP. Yeah.

2999
02:11:51,900 --> 02:11:53,900
Yeah, that would make the most sense. Yep.

3000
02:11:53,900 --> 02:11:55,900
So we'll see.

3001
02:11:55,900 --> 02:11:57,900
Ah, let's hope! Yep.

3002
02:11:57,900 --> 02:11:59,900
We'll be back, Jordan, but until then, we have a website.

3003
02:11:59,900 --> 02:12:01,900
We do have a website, it's KnowledgeFight.com.

3004
02:12:01,900 --> 02:12:03,900
Yep, we're also on Twitter.

3005
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:05,900
We are on Twitter, it's

3006
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:07,900
UnderscoreFight at go2bedjordan.

3007
02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:09,900
Yep, we're also on Facebook. We are on Facebook

3008
02:12:09,900 --> 02:12:11,900
if you're downloading right to iTunes,

3009
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:13,900
and if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund

3010
02:12:13,900 --> 02:12:15,900
in your area to help out people doing God's work right

3011
02:12:15,900 --> 02:12:17,900
now. Yep, we'll be back, but until then,

3012
02:12:17,900 --> 02:12:19,900
I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm

3013
02:12:19,900 --> 02:12:21,900
dzxclark.

3014
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:23,900
I'm the Juiciest Ice Cube.

3015
02:12:23,900 --> 02:12:25,900
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

3016
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:29,900
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan,

3017
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:35,900
I love your work. I love you.
