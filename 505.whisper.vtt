N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:19.600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.200
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

00:25.200 --> 00:30.040
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys, knowledgefight.

00:30.040 --> 00:47.120
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:47.120 --> 01:02.600
Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan, I'm Jordan, we're a couple dudes

01:02.600 --> 01:06.200
that sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

01:06.200 --> 01:10.780
Oh indeed we are, Dan, Jordan, I have a quick question for you, what's up, what's your bright

01:10.780 --> 01:11.780
spot today?

01:11.780 --> 01:17.680
What's your bright spot today, Jordan, paradoxically, very strange, unexpectedly, social media.

01:17.680 --> 01:23.160
Social media, the thing that you have left as soon as you finally realized after eight

01:23.160 --> 01:25.040
months that you should have been gone from it two years ago.

01:25.040 --> 01:30.860
Yeah, I don't like social media in a lot of its manifestations, permutations, because

01:30.860 --> 01:35.240
I find that it just doesn't match with the way my brain works.

01:35.240 --> 01:41.280
Not no shade on people who do enjoy it or like Twitter and Facebook and stuff, I just,

01:41.280 --> 01:42.880
it's not for me.

01:42.880 --> 01:49.620
As I've gotten older I recognize that it's confusing, I don't like, when I was running

01:49.620 --> 01:55.320
the knowledgefight Twitter account, and it became a thing where it's like, I know I'm

01:55.320 --> 02:03.940
using this, everybody who listens to the show knows I'm using this, so if I post promo stuff,

02:03.940 --> 02:04.940
it feels dirty.

02:04.940 --> 02:05.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:05.940 --> 02:10.320
It feels like, I don't know, it's a good aversion to self-promotion, but.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.320
I understand.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.800
Anyway, the reason that I'm throwing a bright spot to social media is I started to think

02:14.800 --> 02:22.680
about like, what are ways that social media can be used in ways that are fun and not dumb,

02:22.680 --> 02:27.020
and everyone keeps asking for pictures of my plants, and so I've started an Instagram

02:27.020 --> 02:30.000
account called Plant Underscore Fight.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Alright, alright.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.400
Where I'm going to post pictures of plants.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.400
I like it.

02:35.400 --> 02:40.100
And so far people have enjoyed it, I've posted a picture of the quinoa so far, and periodically

02:40.100 --> 02:46.600
it will feature different plants from around Dan's wild kingdom, but I figured it's not

02:46.600 --> 02:53.520
connected to the show, it's not too intrusive on my personal life, and it felt like that

02:53.520 --> 02:55.880
nice sweet spot, and something that people enjoy.

02:55.880 --> 02:56.880
People like seeing these plants.

02:56.880 --> 02:57.880
Yeah, I think so.

02:57.880 --> 02:58.880
I think so.

02:58.880 --> 03:03.360
Yeah, so I think maybe this is a function that social media can serve, although I still

03:03.360 --> 03:05.120
think most of it's trash.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.120
Here's what we'll do.

03:06.120 --> 03:09.440
I'll make an Instagram account for my two dogs.

03:09.440 --> 03:14.080
People have asked for me to post pictures of your dogs.

03:14.080 --> 03:21.400
Yeah, I'll go with Westies Underscore Fight will compete to see whose, I guess, growing

03:21.400 --> 03:22.840
things are better.

03:22.840 --> 03:27.320
I'm afraid that your dogs are cuter than most of my plants.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.680
I think I'd probably lose that Underscore Fight.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.160
But I'm not as popular as you, Dan.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.160
I don't know about that.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.160
Oh yeah.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.160
So what's your bright spot?

03:35.160 --> 03:41.480
My bright spot today, Dan, is back to Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but it is a specific reference

03:41.480 --> 03:47.300
in Valhalla that I particularly enjoyed that came out of nowhere, which was a reference

03:47.300 --> 03:48.480
to One Punch Man.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.040
Do you know about One Punch Man?

03:50.040 --> 03:51.520
Vaguely, yeah.

03:51.520 --> 03:57.840
Yeah, so One Punch Man is a manga and an anime about a very depressed guy who can defeat

03:57.840 --> 03:59.840
anything and anyone in one punch.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.720
Yes, I believe you've told me about this.

04:01.720 --> 04:07.960
Yeah, and he's so existentially destroyed by that, like how bored and awful it is to

04:07.960 --> 04:14.640
be the ultimate power in the universe, I guess, that he's just a real bummer all the time.

04:14.640 --> 04:20.320
And there's a perfect reference to that in Valhalla, where you have to fight a guy who

04:20.320 --> 04:24.880
will always defeat you in one punch, and he's a real bummer about it.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.720
People could have guessed that was going to be the spoiler.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.720
Well, yeah.

04:27.720 --> 04:28.720
It's a reference, yeah.

04:28.720 --> 04:29.720
So it's very, very, very funny.

04:29.720 --> 04:30.720
That's nice.

04:30.720 --> 04:31.720
I enjoyed it.

04:31.720 --> 04:32.720
It's my little Easter egg.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.840
It's nice to be surprised by a little reference in there.

04:34.840 --> 04:35.840
Sure.

04:35.840 --> 04:36.840
Ah, it's good.

04:36.840 --> 04:37.840
I have a gripe.

04:37.840 --> 04:43.400
I don't know what the deal is, but I lost a bunch of time on Valhalla.

04:43.400 --> 04:46.600
Did you have a corrupted save where you kept falling through the...

04:46.600 --> 04:49.040
No, I had a bug, though, that I ran into.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.040
Ooh.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.120
And that was... maybe this is just one of those problems that happens when you play

04:53.120 --> 04:56.860
games when they first come out that I'm not really used to.

04:56.860 --> 05:03.440
But there's a mission at a certain point where, without any spoilers, you talk to a guy, and

05:03.440 --> 05:06.240
then you've got to get to another city.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.240
Sure.

05:07.240 --> 05:12.520
You've got to take a boat to get to the other city, and every single time after I talked

05:12.520 --> 05:17.880
to this guy, the boat would spawn in the middle of land.

05:17.880 --> 05:21.080
Like, just as if it were a horse.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.080
Sure.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.080
Sure.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.080
Just in the middle of a path.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.520
I can't do anything with this.

05:26.520 --> 05:34.640
And so I had to go back to my most recent autosave file, and it had autosaved so many

05:34.640 --> 05:38.080
times while that boat was still there.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.080
Sure, sure.

05:39.080 --> 05:42.720
You restarted, like, 50 times, and all your autosaves wound up getting you back to where

05:42.720 --> 05:43.720
the boat was.

05:43.720 --> 05:46.960
So the last save before that was a great mistake.

05:46.960 --> 05:47.960
Four hours.

05:47.960 --> 05:48.960
Yeah.

05:48.960 --> 05:49.960
Yeah.

05:49.960 --> 05:50.960
Yeah.

05:50.960 --> 05:51.960
It was very frustrating, but it is what it is.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.720
Yeah, I had the same thing happen on one mission.

05:54.720 --> 06:00.120
All of a sudden, every time I loaded the save, the entire screen would just start shaking,

06:00.120 --> 06:05.920
and then my character would just fall directly through, and then fall forever until she died.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.480
And that was it.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.600
Even great games, you know, sometimes there are little problems.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.760
Eh, launch date, release bugs, it happens.

06:12.760 --> 06:13.760
Yeah.

06:13.760 --> 06:17.320
And you know the other thing that's really exciting for me, too, is that, like, I know

06:17.320 --> 06:23.320
that Age of Calamity, the Zelda game, Hyrule Warriors, has come out.

06:23.320 --> 06:24.320
Oh, it has.

06:24.320 --> 06:28.480
And I haven't even, I haven't even touched it, or got it, I haven't even thought about

06:28.480 --> 06:29.480
it.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.480
You don't have time.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.480
No.

06:31.480 --> 06:32.480
And that's a nice feeling.

06:32.480 --> 06:33.480
Yeah.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.480
To know that that's there.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.480
Yeah.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.480
If I ever, uh, ever.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.480
Sure.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.480
Because it may not ever happen.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.480
You've got another 80 to 100 hours to put into balance.

06:41.480 --> 06:47.200
If I ever finish with Valhalla, then, uh, you know, Age of Calamity is there waiting for

06:47.200 --> 06:49.080
me, and that's a nice, comforting feeling.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.080
Yeah.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.560
Anyway, I had second bright spot there.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.560
Yeah, that is great!

06:52.560 --> 06:56.480
So, Jordan, today, uh, we've got an interesting episode to go over, um, uh, Alex went out

06:56.480 --> 06:57.480
of Georgia.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.480
Alright.

06:58.480 --> 07:02.880
Um, shout out to the, the couple people, uh, made audio versions of that.

07:02.880 --> 07:03.880
Yes, they did!

07:03.880 --> 07:04.880
They did!

07:04.880 --> 07:05.880
My parody song, which is.

07:05.880 --> 07:06.880
This is very interesting.

07:06.880 --> 07:12.040
This is a new level of fame for me, that, uh, I'm quite frankly uncomfortable with,

07:12.040 --> 07:13.040
but I think is delightful.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.480
You've reached a lot of people.

07:14.480 --> 07:19.200
People have put, uh, put my parody song to music.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.800
Honestly, I think a lot of people were expecting a sequel today.

07:22.800 --> 07:27.040
Um, I don't know if, is there a sequel to The Devil One Time in Georgia?

07:27.040 --> 07:28.040
Uh, yeah.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.040
Not a Charlie Daniels version.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.040
No, no, no.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.040
Well.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.040
But there's a million different.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.720
Well, in that case, mine was a sequel.

07:33.720 --> 07:34.720
That's true.

07:34.720 --> 07:35.720
That's true.

07:35.720 --> 07:36.720
Uh, no.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.720
There is no sequel.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.680
Uh, I figured, you know, can't force it.

07:39.680 --> 07:45.600
Um, but Alex, uh, he went down to Georgia, and I, I will say that, uh, this experience

07:45.600 --> 07:48.800
was not what I wanted it to be.

07:48.800 --> 07:53.600
Um, it lacked a lot of the charm and the fun of the caravan.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.600
Sure.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.120
Um, and that's because the caravan allowed me to paint a picture.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.120
Right.

07:59.120 --> 08:03.080
Whereas, in this case, it's kind of Alex, the picture's painted.

08:03.080 --> 08:06.580
You realize every time we get excited for something, we're talking about people who

08:06.580 --> 08:08.800
turn every good thing into shit.

08:08.800 --> 08:09.800
Yeah, yeah.

08:09.800 --> 08:14.960
We're, we're, we're getting excited about the potential, um, that never gets realized.

08:14.960 --> 08:20.040
We are the fucking Lucy, or no, we're Charlie Brown.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.120
Every time they set up that football, and we're like, we're gonna fucking do it this

08:23.120 --> 08:24.120
time.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.120
Yeah.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.120
We're gonna kick it.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.120
It's gonna be a caravan field goal.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.320
It's gonna be amazing.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.640
And then they slide it out from under us again and again and again.

08:31.640 --> 08:32.640
Yeah.

08:32.640 --> 08:33.640
It's, it is unfortunate.

08:33.640 --> 08:36.980
So, um, there's still some fun to be had along the way.

08:36.980 --> 08:41.560
And I actually had a number of interesting, uh, things that I want to bring up and discuss

08:41.560 --> 08:43.000
in the course of this.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.200
Uh, we're just going to be talking about November 18th, 2020, um, Dan, this is 2020.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.200
Oh, hey.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.200
Oh, you're still alright with it.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.360
I told you, we're still alright with it.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.360
It's too late.

08:51.360 --> 08:52.360
I've accepted it.

08:52.360 --> 08:56.520
I also want to say that when I, uh, uh, discussed this on the last episode, I was actually stuck

08:56.520 --> 08:58.040
in my craw a little bit.

08:58.040 --> 09:03.520
I said that you were submitting to the bit, and I don't actually, that was not the right

09:03.520 --> 09:04.520
choice of word.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.520
I meant surrender.

09:05.520 --> 09:06.520
Surrender is the word.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.520
That was the word I was looking for.

09:07.520 --> 09:08.520
Surrender is a good word.

09:08.520 --> 09:09.520
It bothered me.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.360
For like an entire day that I couldn't come up with that word.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.720
You ever have something stuck in your craw?

09:14.720 --> 09:18.040
I was laying in bed and I was like, I meant surrender, dammit.

09:18.040 --> 09:23.940
Um, so, uh, the reason that we only have this one day is because, I mean, I think the trip

09:23.940 --> 09:26.520
to Georgia is pretty unimpactful.

09:26.520 --> 09:32.860
I think that it's, it's repetitive in nature, what Alex does when he's on the road.

09:32.860 --> 09:37.600
And at the same time, there's enough stuff that happened during this episode that's worth

09:37.600 --> 09:42.680
talking about that to try and force it and do like the whole rest of the week would have

09:42.680 --> 09:45.000
ended up with like a six hour episode.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.960
Still hasn't pulled a computer chip out of that homeless person.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.200
Still has not.

09:49.200 --> 09:53.360
We're on eight months of not pulling the computer chip out of somebody.

09:53.360 --> 09:57.040
Yeah, I'd like to, there's so many running tallies.

09:57.040 --> 10:01.000
How many days has it been since Rand Paul has refused your challenge to debate?

10:01.000 --> 10:04.960
We're getting up to, uh, close to 150.

10:04.960 --> 10:11.600
We are currently on day four of the scourge of, uh, gun toting Daleks running around the

10:11.600 --> 10:12.600
streets.

10:12.600 --> 10:13.600
We are in, like, there's a lot of tallies.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.320
There's a lot of things to keep an eye on.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.320
Yeah.

10:16.320 --> 10:17.320
But you know what I'd like to keep an eye on?

10:17.320 --> 10:18.320
What's that, Dan?

10:18.320 --> 10:21.840
Uh, my gratitude and our gratitude for the folks who have signed up and are supporting

10:21.840 --> 10:22.840
the show.

10:22.840 --> 10:23.840
I like it.

10:23.840 --> 10:27.160
So first I'd like to give a shout out to Kayden, that's with a C. C-A-Y-D-E-N.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.160
Thank you so much.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.160
You are now a policy wonk.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.160
I'm a policy wonk.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.160
Thanks, Kayden.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.160
Thank you.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.440
Next, Joe the fourth with Roman initials, I-V.

10:34.440 --> 10:35.440
Thank you so much.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.580
You're now a policy wonk.

10:36.580 --> 10:37.580
I'm a policy wonk.

10:37.580 --> 10:39.320
Thank you very much, Joe the IV-th.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.320
Thank you.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.760
Next, Da'Rin and that's D-A-R-I-N.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.200
Uh, thank you so much.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.520
You are now a policy wonk.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.620
I'm a policy wonk.

10:45.620 --> 10:46.620
Thanks, Da'Rin.

10:46.620 --> 10:47.620
Thank you.

10:47.620 --> 10:48.620
Next, Taylor D. Thank you so much.

10:48.620 --> 10:49.760
You are now a policy wonk.

10:49.760 --> 10:50.760
I'm a policy wonk.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.080
Thank you very much, Taylor.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.080
Thank you.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.080
Next, Taylor Daines?

10:55.080 --> 10:56.560
Uh, uhh, sure.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.560
Ok.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.160
Next, Zoe P. Thank you so much.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.700
You are now a policy wonk.

11:00.700 --> 11:01.700
I'm a policy wonk.

11:01.700 --> 11:02.700
Thanks Zoe.

11:02.700 --> 11:05.900
You ever get into a Zooey Zoey argument?

11:05.900 --> 11:06.400
No.

11:06.400 --> 11:06.900
Good.

11:06.900 --> 11:07.400
Okay.

11:07.400 --> 11:13.400
Next, this fella asked me to say how I thought his last name was pronounced.

11:13.400 --> 11:13.900
Okay.

11:13.900 --> 11:17.200
And I know that this was just because it looks like Wiener.

11:17.200 --> 11:17.700
Sure.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.000
But I knew it was Wiener.

11:19.000 --> 11:19.500
Sure.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.700
Maybe, maybe...

11:21.700 --> 11:22.600
Sometimes it's Wiener.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.100
I think it's rarely.

11:25.100 --> 11:28.400
I mean like Matt Weiner, isn't he the guy who made Mad Men?

11:28.400 --> 11:28.900
Sure.

11:28.900 --> 11:29.800
Isn't that Matt?

11:29.800 --> 11:30.300
Yeah.

11:30.300 --> 11:31.400
I might have the first name wrong.

11:31.400 --> 11:31.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:31.900 --> 11:32.600
Something like that.

11:32.600 --> 11:33.200
Yeah.

11:33.200 --> 11:33.700
Yeah.

11:33.700 --> 11:35.300
So anyway, Jason, thank you so much.

11:35.300 --> 11:36.900
You are now a policy wonk.

11:36.900 --> 11:37.800
I'm a policy wonk.

11:37.800 --> 11:38.500
Thanks, Jason.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.500
You ever get into a Wiener Weiner argument, Dan?

11:40.500 --> 11:41.000
Yes.

11:41.900 --> 11:42.600
That one I have.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.100
Next, Quasar the Corgi Star.

11:46.100 --> 11:46.700
Thank you so much.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.000
You are now a policy wonk.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.200
I'm a policy wonk.

11:49.200 --> 11:49.600
Thanks.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.700
Cue the CS.

11:51.700 --> 11:55.700
And finally, I'd like to thank you to a couple people who donated on an elevated level from abroad.

11:55.700 --> 11:56.900
Ooh.

11:56.900 --> 11:59.100
So first, Jan from Denmark.

11:59.100 --> 11:59.700
Thank you so much.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.400
You are now a technocrat.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.800
And Mirjum from...

12:03.800 --> 12:06.500
This is a name that I'm not going to be able to handle.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.900
You're going to do this.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.500
Hammond Lina.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.300
Thank you so much.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.000
You are now a technocrat.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.200
I'm a policy wonk.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.000
Crikey, mate.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
That's fantastic.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.300
Have yourself a brew.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.900
How's your 401k doing, bro?

12:17.900 --> 12:20.600
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

12:20.600 --> 12:21.800
Let's just get down to business.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.900
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.600
Why you pimps so good?

12:25.600 --> 12:27.600
My neck is freakishly large.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.100
I declare info war on you.

12:30.100 --> 12:36.600
Thank you so much to our representatives from Denmark and Hammond Lina.

12:36.600 --> 12:36.900
Yes.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.300
Thank you very much to the both of you.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.800
I look forward to your correction about the pronunciation.

12:40.800 --> 12:41.400
It'll be great.

12:41.400 --> 12:41.700
Yeah.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.000
It's pronounced quokka.

12:43.000 --> 12:43.500
Probably.

12:43.500 --> 12:43.800
Yeah.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.100
So if you're out there listening and thinking, hey, I enjoy the show.

12:46.100 --> 12:47.000
I'd like to support these giants.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.800
You can do that by going to our website, pressing that button that says support the show or...

12:50.800 --> 13:00.000
If you are experiencing any kind of malaise or perhaps existential crisis, what you should do is fill yourself with a generous spirit.

13:00.000 --> 13:09.000
Channel that chi energy all the way up into your fist and punch a local charity or bail fund, but metaphorically and with generosity.

13:09.000 --> 13:09.400
All right.

13:09.400 --> 13:09.900
That works.

13:09.900 --> 13:15.800
So Jordan, this is the reverse of the caravan.

13:15.800 --> 13:16.400
Mm hmm.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.700
This is and I don't know why I didn't see the Navarock.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.300
I don't know why I didn't see this in advance.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.600
I'm so blind.

13:23.600 --> 13:27.900
I'm so blind to like what's actually going to happen.

13:27.900 --> 13:28.500
Sure.

13:28.500 --> 13:32.000
Because like Alex going down to Georgia, it's like, this is exciting.

13:32.000 --> 13:48.500
Alex is going to be rampaging it, but I forgot that that means that Owen is going to be hosting the show and like, I forgot that like, oh, it's the flip of the dynamic from the caravan where Owen's out on the road and Alex is, you know, throwing to him in the field.

13:48.500 --> 13:55.200
Now we've got, God, I was just like, as soon as you get into it, you're like, oh no.

13:55.200 --> 13:58.700
How does, how does Owen try and really pull off three hours?

13:58.700 --> 14:07.200
Well, one of the ways he does it is he mostly plays a live feed of Alex and Ali Alexander yelling in Atlanta on this episode.

14:07.200 --> 14:07.600
That's smart.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.000
There's a lot of that.

14:09.000 --> 14:09.300
Yeah.

14:09.300 --> 14:10.800
So thankfully there's that.

14:10.800 --> 14:11.200
Sure.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.000
And I will say I appreciate it.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.700
And the episode starts with Alex doing a little bit of a message.

14:16.700 --> 14:19.000
This is the mark of the beast out of Revelation.

14:19.000 --> 14:19.900
It's not coming.

14:19.900 --> 14:20.800
It's here.

14:20.800 --> 14:27.600
And so many of the big Baptist churches and Catholic churches are putting in the QR codes and doing all the same thing because they're not churches.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.000
They've been taken over by this system.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.400
So it's going to all get rapidly worse very, very quickly.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.400
So Alex has got some fear of QR codes.

14:35.400 --> 14:41.400
She wants everyone to have, I don't know what he thinks QR codes are the thing that's been around for 15 years.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.600
It's been around for a while.

14:42.600 --> 14:49.100
And in the real world, they're just an advancement of the same idea behind a barcode, which is used by many retail outlets.

14:49.100 --> 14:55.500
I say many because if you don't want to use barcodes and UPC scanners to ring up products, you don't have to.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.200
No, you do.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.000
It's compelled by the mark of the beast.

14:58.000 --> 14:58.800
You don't have to.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.000
No, it's compelled by the mark of the beast.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.600
It's just efficient.

15:03.600 --> 15:08.900
The main reason I pulled this clip was to illustrate how deep into the nonsense Alex is to start this show off.

15:08.900 --> 15:19.000
The second reason I included this clip is probably more important and it's to use this as an opportunity to explain how people like Alex are broken records trying to make everyone afraid of everything for no reason.

15:19.000 --> 15:31.300
QR codes are something that Alex is trying to scare his audience about, and interestingly, if you look into the history of the thing that preceded QR codes, the UPC barcode, you'll find hysterical people doing the exact same thing 50 years ago.

15:31.300 --> 15:34.900
According to an article about UPC history in Wired, quote,

15:34.900 --> 15:48.900
when the first UPC scanners arrived in the early 1970s, according to various IBMers who worked on the project, there were protests at grocery stores even though the codes appeared on coke cans and jars of applesauce, not right hands and foreheads.

15:48.900 --> 15:50.400
I love Christianity.

15:50.400 --> 15:57.900
And in the year that followed, an urban legend arose, warning gullible types that the number 666 was hidden in each barcode.

15:57.900 --> 16:04.400
Some of these paranoid types noted that there were often sixes in the barcode, which were in fact arbitrary, but it doesn't matter.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.900
Again, from the article, quote,

16:05.900 --> 16:17.900
Early test films of the scanners were labeled with the letters F, G, and H, and some saw this as proof that the code would wind up on more than just coke cans, assisting the H stood for head and the F for forearm.

16:17.900 --> 16:18.400
Sure.

16:18.400 --> 16:23.400
People do this, it's inevitable, because change and the future are both scary things.

16:23.400 --> 16:30.900
The more complex a system is, the greater possibility it has in terms of productivity and effectiveness and ability to help people live better lives,

16:30.900 --> 16:35.900
but as that complexity increases, the theoretical damage that it could cause go up too.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.900
A simple example is just the internet.

16:38.900 --> 16:47.900
The ability for people to communicate and digitally interact over great distances, it's revolutionary in terms of information flow and directing charitable assistance to places that need it,

16:47.900 --> 16:51.900
but it's created a gigantic tinderbox that could explode at any time.

16:51.900 --> 16:56.900
For instance, back in 2013, the Associated Press's Twitter account got hacked,

16:56.900 --> 17:02.900
and a fake tweet was posted about two explosions going off at the White House that had injured President Obama.

17:02.900 --> 17:14.900
This wasn't true, but the effect on the stock market was real, and it's the byproduct of a volatility that would not exist without the ability for information to travel exceedingly fast.

17:14.900 --> 17:18.900
Almost every technology you can imagine can be slotted into this kind of balance.

17:18.900 --> 17:24.900
Having a centralized power company in your town relieves you of the burden of having to run a generator yourself,

17:24.900 --> 17:30.900
but also, if there's a bad storm in your area, your whole block might end up losing power for a while.

17:30.900 --> 17:36.900
The complexity of emerging technologies provides benefits, but also increases the problems when something goes wrong.

17:36.900 --> 17:47.900
Alex is just one in a long, long chain of hysterical idiots yelling about how some new-ish, not even that new, new-ish, invention is the end of the world.

17:47.900 --> 17:52.900
He's rambling about QR codes just like his forefathers, who protested barcodes outside grocery stores.

17:52.900 --> 17:59.900
It's a real bummer that John of Patmos really maligned a more efficient system.

17:59.900 --> 18:03.900
Like, maybe if Satan were less of a—like, God is kind of a Luddite in this scenario, right?

18:03.900 --> 18:08.900
So the Antichrist is like, hey, let's give everybody a mark so we can do the whole thing.

18:08.900 --> 18:10.900
You can do commerce, you can do all this stuff.

18:10.900 --> 18:15.900
Yeah, I get that that can be abused, but it's still a more efficient system, all right?

18:15.900 --> 18:17.900
God is out here like, let's give everybody free will.

18:17.900 --> 18:20.900
Fuck that noise. That gets everybody complicated.

18:20.900 --> 18:26.900
See what we're talking about with Twitter? People are jumping out there, lying, ruining the stock market in two seconds.

18:26.900 --> 18:30.900
Put the mark of the beast on everybody, forehead, call it a day.

18:30.900 --> 18:31.900
All right.

18:31.900 --> 18:33.900
Yeah, that's my plan.

18:33.900 --> 18:40.900
I lost myself entirely in that speech. I was like, all right, yeah, let's do that.

18:40.900 --> 18:45.900
You have a hypnotic power today, Jordan. I'm worried about it.

18:45.900 --> 18:54.900
So Alex is on the scene in Atlanta with Ali, and the beginning of the show is what appears to be a pre-recorded—

18:54.900 --> 18:59.900
or it could have been live, I'm not entirely sure—thing of them just sort of yelling about this stuff.

18:59.900 --> 19:00.900
Yeah, yeah.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.900
And Ali has some big news to break down.

19:03.900 --> 19:08.900
This is just one example of dozens that have already come out in the last day. This is just now breaking in Georgia, where we are.

19:08.900 --> 19:14.900
Just this morning, it is breaking news. David Shafer, the Georgia Republican Party chair, tweets this.

19:14.900 --> 19:22.900
One of our monitors discovered 9,626 vote error in DeKalb County hand count. That is in Atlanta.

19:22.900 --> 19:31.900
One batch was labeled 10,707 votes for Biden and just 13 for Trump, an improbable margin even for DeKalb standards.

19:31.900 --> 19:38.900
The actual count for the batch was 1,081 for Biden and 13 for Trump.

19:38.900 --> 19:48.900
Had this counting error not been discovered, Biden would have gained enough votes from this one batch alone to cancel out Trump's gains from Fayette County, Floyd, and Walton.

19:48.900 --> 19:55.900
Folks, we have to audit the vote, and we have to check the signatures in Georgia. That's why Alex Jones and I are here.

19:55.900 --> 20:01.900
So Ali is reporting based on a tweet that was posted by David Shafer, the head of the GOP in Georgia.

20:01.900 --> 20:10.900
But it's a very misleading tweet designed to be used by bad faith actors like Alex and Ali to fuel their machines that they're trying to use to overturn this election.

20:10.900 --> 20:11.900
Naturally.

20:11.900 --> 20:18.900
Basically what happened was this. They're conducting this recount in Georgia, and during the recount someone made a recording error.

20:18.900 --> 20:27.900
That is to say that they mistakenly put down over 10,000 votes for Biden and 13 for Trump, when in reality the total was just over 1,000 for Biden and 13 for Trump.

20:27.900 --> 20:31.900
This mistake was caught in the recount, and that's what Shafer is yelling about.

20:31.900 --> 20:32.900
Sure.

20:32.900 --> 20:39.900
This counting error was not made in the initial automated count of the ballots, only in the recount, so it does not actually affect the totals for the state at all.

20:39.900 --> 20:44.900
But that's the impression that Shafer's tweet and Alex's coverage are designed to leave the audience with.

20:44.900 --> 20:45.900
Sure.

20:45.900 --> 20:56.900
The idea is supposed to be that their sleuths uncovered 9,000 votes from the actual election for Biden that were erroneous, when in reality someone involved with the recount made a mistake and the process caught it before it actually was a big mistake.

20:56.900 --> 20:57.900
Yeah, that'll happen.

20:57.900 --> 21:08.900
The DeKalb County CEO released a statement that basically said that they were unable to verify the claims of this error, but to put it in my words, even if everything Shafer said is true, it doesn't matter.

21:08.900 --> 21:14.900
Quote, based on Chairman Shafer's Twitter storm, I was a little surprised by the tone of this statement.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.900
Chairman Shafer, okay.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.900
No, I was more about the Twitter storm part.

21:18.900 --> 21:19.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:19.900 --> 21:31.900
Based on Chairman Shafer's Twitter storm, the alleged vote error was discovered, reported to DeKalb elections officials, and corrected prior to the transmission of the official audit report to the Georgia Secretary of State's office.

21:31.900 --> 21:43.900
If the scenario occurred, as Chairman Shafer alleges, this is evidence that the checks and balances established by Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ensure the accuracy of the election results performed as designed.

21:43.900 --> 21:50.900
As is always the case with Alex and Allie, this is a dud, but it's a dud that they're probably going to use as a piece of evidence of fraud.

21:50.900 --> 21:51.900
Sure, forever.

21:51.900 --> 21:52.900
Yep.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.900
And it's not just Georgia, baby!

21:54.900 --> 21:55.900
It's not!

21:55.900 --> 22:03.900
Somebody during the recount accidentally put an extra zero, and then they found it, and now it's all over.

22:03.900 --> 22:04.900
More or less.

22:04.900 --> 22:05.900
Yeah.

22:05.900 --> 22:06.900
Yeah.

22:06.900 --> 22:07.900
Yeah.

22:07.900 --> 22:08.900
Okay, cool.

22:08.900 --> 22:09.900
But it's not just Georgia.

22:09.900 --> 22:10.900
Thanks, America.

22:10.900 --> 22:11.900
It's also Michigan.

22:11.900 --> 22:12.900
Sure.

22:12.900 --> 22:18.900
So breaking news, Allie, on the situation that is just explosive, like out of a Hollywood gangster movie in Michigan.

22:18.900 --> 22:19.900
Tell us about that.

22:19.900 --> 22:27.900
So in Wayne County, Michigan, that's Detroit, the Republicans, two Republicans and two Democrats sit on the canvassing board.

22:27.900 --> 22:41.900
The Republicans decided not to certify the election, but under duress and threat from hundreds of thousands of tweets, the leftist Antifa, BLM, they reluctantly agreed under the condition that the Secretary of State would do an audit.

22:41.900 --> 22:48.900
We are in legal and constitutional limbo as we don't even understand what that means, what are their rights.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.900
No, you don't understand what that means.

22:50.900 --> 22:56.900
So we have this bullying from the left against people who just want to certify clean elections, not bad elections.

22:56.900 --> 23:00.900
What Allie is saying is inaccurate, but let's pretend for a moment what he's saying is true.

23:00.900 --> 23:08.900
That would mean that the Republicans on this council he's talking about were willing to certify an election that they felt was fraudulent because people were mean to them on Twitter.

23:08.900 --> 23:09.900
Yep.

23:09.900 --> 23:16.900
I'm sorry, Allie is saying that like it's an understandable thing, like the leftists are just too mean on Twitter, they had to certify the results.

23:16.900 --> 23:21.900
Well, when you say mean things, that's how the American Revolution started.

23:21.900 --> 23:27.900
Sure, there was the taxation thing, but George was like, these guys are a bunch of dicks, and they were like, well, we got to tear this place down.

23:27.900 --> 23:33.900
Yeah, I mean, it's like in the Declaration of Independence, cyberbullying comes up a lot.

23:33.900 --> 23:35.900
How dare you write letters to us?

23:35.900 --> 23:43.900
Allie is saying, like the people tweeting stuff, this mean stuff, it's like the equivalent of having a gun to your head, which is ridiculous.

23:43.900 --> 23:54.900
If it's your job to make sure the election is fair, and your decision-making process is in any way affected by what someone on Twitter says, you've proven exactly one thing, and that is that you're not qualified for your position.

23:54.900 --> 23:55.900
Yeah.

23:55.900 --> 24:00.900
The Wayne County Board of Canvassers met to certify the election results, and things broke down on a party line.

24:00.900 --> 24:07.900
With the two Republicans, William Hartman and Monica Palmer, voting against certification, and the Democrats voting for certification.

24:07.900 --> 24:13.900
At issue was the number, there was a number of precincts that had an unexplained discrepancy in vote totals.

24:13.900 --> 24:19.900
According to the Detroit Free Press, quote, most of them recorded discrepancies of three votes or fewer.

24:19.900 --> 24:26.900
In 2016, there were similar discrepancies in voter totals, and Jill Stein's campaign had pushed for a recount.

24:26.900 --> 24:32.900
This recount was ended by a court order before it could be completed, but after the election was over, the state of Michigan did do an audit,

24:32.900 --> 24:38.900
and it found that a vast majority of the unexplained discrepancies were easily explainable by human error,

24:38.900 --> 24:49.900
and that, quote, many of the problems encountered in Detroit are attributable to a lack of proficiency using EPB software, or the mishandling of provisional envelope ballots.

24:49.900 --> 24:57.900
They found in their audit that votes were accurately counted, but that there were mistakes made in terms of being able to correctly match each vote with its ballot,

24:57.900 --> 24:59.900
because of these various human errors.

24:59.900 --> 25:06.900
It's incredibly likely, almost to a point of certainty, that this same phenomenon is present here in the 2020 election.

25:06.900 --> 25:13.900
Ultimately, Palmer and Hartman agreed to certify the Wayne County results when the Democrats on the board agreed to do an audit of the votes,

25:13.900 --> 25:20.900
but apparently, Palmer and Hartman didn't realize that the audit would be literally impossible to do prior to the certification of the election,

25:20.900 --> 25:26.900
and so they tried to recant their certification, which is something they can't do, so that's where things stand right now.

25:26.900 --> 25:30.900
Oh, you know, you can recant a certification after an election. That's how it always works, Dan.

25:30.900 --> 25:39.900
The cynical-minded fellow out there might think that the real reason that Palmer and Hartman decided to recant their decision to certify is that Trump called them personally, but what do I know?

25:39.900 --> 25:40.900
Oh, that'd be crazy.

25:40.900 --> 25:50.900
Now, Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chair, is calling for Michigan to adjourn their board for 14 days to get to the bottom of these very serious, or possibly wildly overblown, issues.

25:50.900 --> 25:59.900
At the point of us recording this episode, we don't know how this is gonna shake out, because the board in Michigan is set to certify on Monday, which is in the future from us right now.

25:59.900 --> 26:00.900
Great.

26:00.900 --> 26:08.900
All signs appear to indicate that, like Georgia, they will certify the results, but this world is fucking insane, so I am not going to take anything for granted.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.900
Yeah, come on, why not?

26:10.900 --> 26:13.900
But the reality is that there were precincts-

26:13.900 --> 26:16.900
Let's get a nice Andrew Johnson in there to help take us over.

26:16.900 --> 26:18.900
Couldn't hurt. Could hurt, could hurt, could hurt.

26:18.900 --> 26:24.900
What's the wrong with it? No, no, no, no, no. Whenever there's a fraudulent election, you want an Andrew Johnson to come back in there.

26:24.900 --> 26:31.900
Well, there were issues of voting discrepancies that are, to an extent, normal.

26:31.900 --> 26:32.900
Sure.

26:32.900 --> 26:38.900
And that is something that's being weaponized by Ali, and one of the ways that he's doing it is just outright lying.

26:38.900 --> 26:46.900
They're still calling for an audit, but they did go ahead and say they're going to certify it, because things were, quote, out of balance at a record level.

26:46.900 --> 26:50.900
So they're out of balance at a record level. I think it was double from 2016 to now.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.900
That's just categorically not true.

26:53.900 --> 27:03.900
Alex and Ali are making this stuff up, knowing that no one in their audience will question them or go consult the 2016 audit, which I would bet anything I own that even these two dudes don't know exists.

27:03.900 --> 27:05.900
It'd be really hard to find. You'd have to Google it.

27:05.900 --> 27:06.900
It's not hard.

27:06.900 --> 27:07.900
And then you'd read it.

27:07.900 --> 27:08.900
That part might be hard for them.

27:08.900 --> 27:10.900
Have you read things before? That's hard.

27:10.900 --> 27:29.900
The Detroit Free Press said this of the unexplained discrepancies in Wayne County in the 2020 election, quote, of Detroit's 503 election day precincts, 85 recorded unexplained discrepancies in the vote totals, as did 94 of the city's 134 absentee voting counting boards.

27:29.900 --> 27:32.900
Most of them recorded discrepancies of three votes or fewer.

27:32.900 --> 27:49.900
If you consult the 2016 election audit conducted by the Michigan Department of State, you'll find that, quote, the Wayne County Board of Canvassers reported during the post-election canvas period that concluded November 22, 2016, approximately 392 precincts appeared to be out of balance.

27:49.900 --> 28:00.900
If you combine the in-person and absentee counting boards from 2020, you have a decrease of 213 out of balance precincts in this election compared to four years ago, not double.

28:00.900 --> 28:04.900
Sure, sure, but that's by 10,000 each time.

28:04.900 --> 28:05.900
Sure.

28:05.900 --> 28:09.900
Every single one of those is an accidental adding of 1,000.

28:09.900 --> 28:10.900
No.

28:10.900 --> 28:19.900
And these numbers probably sound high, and they kind of are, but these are almost entirely indicative of minor human errors that do not actually affect vote counts.

28:19.900 --> 28:21.900
But they do lead to accounting problems.

28:21.900 --> 28:34.900
For instance, the audit report discusses the case in 2016 of Precinct 152, where the sealed ballot container, it only had 50 votes in it at the end of the night, but the rules indicated that 306 votes had been cast.

28:34.900 --> 28:41.900
This was because poll workers had accidentally left the rest of the ballots in the tabulator and failed to put them then into the sealed container.

28:41.900 --> 28:42.900
Sure.

28:42.900 --> 28:48.900
It's a problem, and it will lead to a discrepancy, but it doesn't actually have any bearing on the vote tallies or mean there was any fraud.

28:48.900 --> 29:02.900
Most problems that you will hear people like Alex yell about fall into this category, and I would be willing to venture a guess that in a few months, whenever there is an audit of this election, which Alex will ignore by that point, you'll find a lot of similar human error issues.

29:02.900 --> 29:03.900
Sure.

29:03.900 --> 29:17.900
I mean, have you ever counted to 1,000 and then counted to 1,000 with two people over your shoulder, six feet away from you, going like, no, that's one more for the other team.

29:17.900 --> 29:19.900
Like, of course you're going to get three wrong.

29:19.900 --> 29:27.900
I mean, look, in Mario Party 6, I think, there was a little mini-game where you had to remember the order of fruits.

29:27.900 --> 29:28.900
Yeah.

29:28.900 --> 29:29.900
Yeah?

29:29.900 --> 29:31.900
You had to remember four fruits, usually.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.900
And sometimes my friends got it wrong.

29:33.900 --> 29:34.900
Of course.

29:34.900 --> 29:38.900
Well, I mean, granted, we were high as hell when we would play it, but still.

29:38.900 --> 29:39.900
Sure.

29:39.900 --> 29:47.900
One time, my buddy Swearengen, it was a bundle of grapes was the thing he had to remember.

29:47.900 --> 29:51.900
I think it was grapes, and he pluralized it, and he got it wrong.

29:51.900 --> 29:52.900
You went off on it.

29:52.900 --> 29:53.900
No, he got it wrong.

29:53.900 --> 29:55.900
Oh, that's right, because the game does it for you.

29:55.900 --> 29:57.900
Yeah, because it was the voice.

29:57.900 --> 30:01.900
It wasn't like a Scattergories argument that everybody got into.

30:01.900 --> 30:10.900
It was that weird period where the, I think it was the GameCube, had a microphone that you could have, like, a couple voice commands.

30:10.900 --> 30:14.900
It would recognize, so you'd be like, banana, grape.

30:14.900 --> 30:15.900
Sure.

30:15.900 --> 30:16.900
And he got it wrong even though he had the right...

30:16.900 --> 30:17.900
Because he said grapes.

30:17.900 --> 30:18.900
I think so, yeah.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.900
Lives on in my memory.

30:20.900 --> 30:21.900
Forever.

30:21.900 --> 30:24.900
Anyway, yeah, my point is that people can make mistakes.

30:24.900 --> 30:25.900
People make mistakes.

30:25.900 --> 30:32.900
The larger point here, though, is that Ali and Alex are completely wrong and absolutely just making up that there's record levels of precincts being out of balance.

30:32.900 --> 30:37.900
They have no idea what they're talking about, and the actual numbers are the exact opposite of their narrative.

30:37.900 --> 30:46.900
There wasn't record discrepancy, and if you go by the strict numbers, there was a 54% decrease in precincts reporting unexplained discrepancies this election cycle.

30:46.900 --> 30:48.900
Seems like progress.

30:48.900 --> 31:01.900
Yeah, that would make sense considering for the, like, three months up to the election everybody was constantly screaming about how there's no possible way that this would be a fair-counted election, so everybody went so fucking overboard.

31:01.900 --> 31:10.900
Well, and because of those discrepancies that happened in the 2016 election, there were probably a lot of conversations about little things that could be done to limit...

31:10.900 --> 31:21.900
Well, I think that, I mean, obviously you'd like to see that number even lower, but that much of a decrease from one presidential election to another seems, like, pretty good.

31:21.900 --> 31:22.900
I don't know.

31:22.900 --> 31:31.900
I mean, let's say we've got, what is it, almost 150 million votes cast, or over 160 million now? Something along those lines.

31:31.900 --> 31:43.900
And we have, what, it's 50% of the counties in Michigan in 2016 reported fewer than three, three or fewer.

31:43.900 --> 31:48.900
Like, that's a vote tally of discrepancy less than a thousand.

31:48.900 --> 31:52.900
In Michigan, that's ridiculously...

31:52.900 --> 32:00.900
Yeah, and reading over this audit, they were discussing that, like, the really bad ones are ones that had over three.

32:00.900 --> 32:01.900
Yeah.

32:01.900 --> 32:07.900
And that, you know, it leads you to recognize that these ones that are out of balance aren't out of balance by, like, a thousand.

32:07.900 --> 32:08.900
No.

32:08.900 --> 32:09.900
That would be egregious.

32:09.900 --> 32:10.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:10.900 --> 32:12.900
That would be, like, national alarms going off.

32:12.900 --> 32:13.900
Totally. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:13.900 --> 32:16.900
Yeah, it's severe when there's three or four votes that are...

32:16.900 --> 32:20.900
Somebody added a zero, and it's a story for months now, you know?

32:20.900 --> 32:25.900
Well, yeah, and it was, you know, in a recount, and it got caught before anything...

32:25.900 --> 32:26.900
Sure, sure.

32:26.900 --> 32:27.900
Before it had any impact on anything.

32:27.900 --> 32:28.900
Totally.

32:28.900 --> 32:36.900
So, anyway, these are kind of the big sort of election fraud narratives that they got, and both are just like, oh, here's the real story.

32:36.900 --> 32:42.900
I understand where your lies are coming from and the spin you're putting on, but it's just... it's flimsy.

32:42.900 --> 32:44.900
As is this.

32:44.900 --> 32:47.900
Ali has some things he wants to complain about.

32:47.900 --> 32:49.900
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

32:49.900 --> 32:56.900
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in a 5-2 decision said it doesn't matter that there were no Republicans in some of these polling locations.

32:56.900 --> 32:57.900
It's fine.

32:57.900 --> 32:59.900
That is not true.

32:59.900 --> 33:00.900
Well, that sounds true.

33:00.900 --> 33:01.900
Here's what's going on here.

33:01.900 --> 33:12.900
Trump's legal team had argued that their poll watchers in Pennsylvania were not allowed close enough access to voters, vote counters, excuse me, in the Philadelphia Convention Center.

33:12.900 --> 33:23.900
Because of many factors, perhaps most importantly COVID-19-related social distancing, the poll watchers were kept behind a barrier approximately 15 to 18 feet away from the first row of canvassers.

33:23.900 --> 33:28.900
So the workers would have a safe area to come and go as needed, like they had to go to the bathroom or whatever.

33:28.900 --> 33:35.900
The Trump campaign argued that this was not appropriate, and a lower judge reached a compromise where they could set the barrier at six feet.

33:35.900 --> 33:44.900
Then Trump's campaign filed a lawsuit claiming that the votes that were counted before the barrier were moved were, uh, they shouldn't count since the watchers didn't have appropriate access.

33:44.900 --> 33:58.900
The matter reached the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, who ruled that the initial distance was appropriate for the requirements in the election code, and to mandate that the distance was too great would be the state encroaching on the county's right to run its election through the Philadelphia County Board of Elections.

33:58.900 --> 33:59.900
That does sound right.

33:59.900 --> 34:00.900
Yep.

34:00.900 --> 34:03.900
They vacated any previous order and denied the Trump campaign their requests.

34:03.900 --> 34:04.900
Oh, that's fair.

34:04.900 --> 34:07.900
This is not what Ali is reporting.

34:07.900 --> 34:08.900
No.

34:08.900 --> 34:14.900
The Supreme Court decided that it was fine that the Republicans had no poll watchers, which is not at all the issue that was before the court.

34:14.900 --> 34:16.900
He's lying about it because it sounds better for his side.

34:16.900 --> 34:17.900
Sounds way better.

34:17.900 --> 34:18.900
Yeah, because he's a liar.

34:18.900 --> 34:19.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:19.900 --> 34:25.900
This same strategy has been employed by Trump's legal team, including noted weirdo Jenna Ellis, who said, quote,

34:25.900 --> 34:33.900
It's inexplicable that five justices on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would conclude that watchers observing from distances up to 100 feet away is reasonable.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.900
And then she pulled out her slide whistle and went, boop!

34:36.900 --> 34:37.900
No, downward.

34:37.900 --> 34:38.900
Boop!

34:38.900 --> 34:39.900
Boop!

34:39.900 --> 34:40.900
Yeah.

34:40.900 --> 34:41.900
Okay.

34:41.900 --> 34:42.900
There is no evidence that this is the case at all.

34:42.900 --> 34:45.900
In fact, the only reference to 100 feet in the court decision is, quote,

34:45.900 --> 34:53.900
The campaign contends that the board set up imposing a barrier and having some tables in the area over 100 feet away from the edge of the security fence,

34:53.900 --> 35:06.900
effectively deprived its representative of the ability to be truly present and effectively eliminates the representative's ability to perform his or her role of ensuring openness and transparency in the electoral process.

35:06.900 --> 35:11.900
That idea only exists as a thing that the Trump legal team claimed but isn't substantiated.

35:11.900 --> 35:20.900
I like that the Trump legal team could just be like, yeah, we're claiming that 30 different drone bombs killed all the Republican in the United States, and nobody is talking about that.

35:20.900 --> 35:21.900
Nobody's talking.

35:21.900 --> 35:27.900
And the Pennsylvania Supreme Court isn't even going to certify that the election was stolen since all Republicans are dead now.

35:27.900 --> 35:28.900
Sure.

35:28.900 --> 35:34.900
If you look at the findings of the suit, you can find out what the maximum distance from a person the watchers would be.

35:34.900 --> 35:41.900
There was a 15 to 18 foot divide between the watchers and the first row of tables, then from the suit, quote,

35:41.900 --> 35:49.900
A designated area of the convention center was divided into discrete sections, each devoted to various aspects of the pre-canvassing and canvassing process.

35:49.900 --> 35:55.900
Each section contained three rows of folding tables, each table separated by five to six feet.

35:55.900 --> 36:03.900
Even if you assume that, like, each table takes up six feet on its own and you use the high end of 18 feet for the initial barrier,

36:03.900 --> 36:08.900
you still end up only with a distance of 54 feet from the barrier to the furthest table.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.900
But of course, you know, also people could observe from different angles.

36:11.900 --> 36:12.900
Sure.

36:12.900 --> 36:17.900
Anyway, my point here is that you can easily see how talking points get created out of this.

36:17.900 --> 36:22.900
For someone like Jenna Ellis, she can claim in a suit that people are 100 feet away, and then when the suit gets thrown out,

36:22.900 --> 36:27.900
she can claim that the court determined that people 100 feet away is totally fine, and that's not necessarily accurate.

36:27.900 --> 36:29.900
No, they can make any claim they want.

36:29.900 --> 36:32.900
But this is how you can spin this case rightly being rejected.

36:32.900 --> 36:33.900
Yeah.

36:33.900 --> 36:38.900
And as for someone like Allie, you know, he doesn't have to worry about things like getting disbarred or anything,

36:38.900 --> 36:40.900
so he's free to just make up anything.

36:40.900 --> 36:41.900
Yeah, why not?

36:41.900 --> 36:42.900
Which is what he's doing.

36:42.900 --> 36:43.900
Yeah, go for it.

36:43.900 --> 36:44.900
It's great.

36:44.900 --> 36:51.900
Well, there's just no way, I'm blown away that at no point in time do any of these courts just be like,

36:51.900 --> 36:55.900
we're holding you in contempt for this dumb argument.

36:55.900 --> 37:00.900
One time, hold them, it's pathetic. It's pathetic.

37:00.900 --> 37:06.900
It's a shameful thing to be a, I can't imagine being a judge reading one of these things and being like,

37:06.900 --> 37:09.900
my job is valuable. How could you possibly think that?

37:09.900 --> 37:12.900
I mean, you see how long it took to like disbar Larry Klayman, though.

37:12.900 --> 37:13.900
Exactly.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.900
Or like get him suspended.

37:15.900 --> 37:19.900
They'll do anything to avoid telling each other that they're doing a bad job.

37:19.900 --> 37:20.900
It does seem that way.

37:20.900 --> 37:21.900
Yeah.

37:21.900 --> 37:28.900
So there's a plan in Georgia, and it's not a fiddle contest, but Allie has this plan that he's going to lay out.

37:28.900 --> 37:29.900
Alright.

37:29.900 --> 37:33.900
He's one of these guys who really likes, I think he fancies himself a Bond villain.

37:33.900 --> 37:34.900
Sure.

37:34.900 --> 37:36.900
He really likes to lay out his plan.

37:36.900 --> 37:37.900
Okay.

37:37.900 --> 37:42.900
We're in Georgia, tell folks about what we're doing the next four days in a row at high noon.

37:42.900 --> 37:48.900
So at high noon at the Georgia State Capitol, Alex Jones, myself and other patriots are here,

37:48.900 --> 37:52.900
and we are marching and we are telling the Secretary of State, stop, don't certify.

37:52.900 --> 37:55.900
The chances of that happening are zero.

37:55.900 --> 38:00.900
But we might stop the deadline that happens 24 hours after that, and that's when Governor Brian Kemp,

38:00.900 --> 38:05.900
who's been wobbly on this whole issue, then has to certify the election from his office.

38:05.900 --> 38:06.900
So...

38:06.900 --> 38:08.900
MWAHAHAHA!

38:08.900 --> 38:13.900
That was less nefarious than some of the other times, but like he's being a little blunt.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.900
I kind of appreciate that.

38:15.900 --> 38:17.900
There's no chance we're going to achieve this goal.

38:17.900 --> 38:23.900
We're going to fail, but maybe we won't fail later, even though it seems like planning to fail from the beginning

38:23.900 --> 38:26.900
would suggest that we are going to continue to fail.

38:26.900 --> 38:30.900
Listen, every day at noon we're going to be marching for something that is not going to work.

38:30.900 --> 38:34.900
And then, maybe after that, the Governor will do some...

38:34.900 --> 38:37.900
And by the way, Kemp did certify.

38:37.900 --> 38:39.900
Yeah, well, of course.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.900
That also had a zero percent chance of working.

38:42.900 --> 38:44.900
You fucking larping pieces.

38:44.900 --> 38:47.900
We're going to high noon! Get the fuck out of here.

38:47.900 --> 38:48.900
Get a job.

38:48.900 --> 38:49.900
Guns blazing.

38:49.900 --> 38:50.900
Get a fucking job.

38:50.900 --> 38:52.900
He has a job. This is it.

38:52.900 --> 38:54.900
Yeah, well, get a different one.

38:54.900 --> 39:01.900
Well, he might have to, because even Ali recognizes here that if Brian Kemp, if he certifies...

39:01.900 --> 39:04.900
If even Brian Kemp isn't on our team...

39:04.900 --> 39:05.900
We might be fucked.

39:05.900 --> 39:06.900
We're fucked.

39:06.900 --> 39:12.900
When he signs a piece of paper certifying the election, it puts a Democrat slate of electors to the Electoral College.

39:12.900 --> 39:14.900
We cannot have this happen.

39:14.900 --> 39:18.900
If this happens, our remedies in court then become next to nil.

39:18.900 --> 39:22.900
Well, that's where we are now. You've lost Georgia.

39:22.900 --> 39:23.900
Move along.

39:23.900 --> 39:26.900
Let's get Alex to Philadelphia or something.

39:26.900 --> 39:28.900
Let's get him in a fight with Grady.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.900
Yeah.

39:30.900 --> 39:32.900
These fucking guys.

39:32.900 --> 39:34.900
I wonder what the next state will be.

39:34.900 --> 39:36.900
Alex went to Arizona.

39:36.900 --> 39:38.900
He went to Georgia.

39:38.900 --> 39:40.900
This isn't going to work in Georgia.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.900
What's next? What's the next state?

39:42.900 --> 39:43.900
I don't know.

39:43.900 --> 39:47.900
With the weakness of all of these legal challenges...

39:47.900 --> 39:51.900
They're not going to get less desperate.

39:51.900 --> 39:54.900
These are already incredibly pathetic.

39:54.900 --> 39:56.900
What happens when all of these fail?

39:56.900 --> 40:00.900
They have to do something and it's going to be even more desperate than what it is now.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.900
I think it's got to be go to D.C. again or something.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.900
Yeah, it's got to be something like that.

40:04.900 --> 40:10.900
Or maybe Lexington and Concord, because you know how much they love the Revolutionary War stuff.

40:10.900 --> 40:14.900
So maybe try and recreate that. Go down to Boston or something.

40:14.900 --> 40:18.900
I'm waiting for them to be like, okay, we're going to head to South Carolina.

40:18.900 --> 40:20.900
There's a couple forts around.

40:20.900 --> 40:21.900
Oh boy.

40:21.900 --> 40:23.900
We'll just see what happens.

40:23.900 --> 40:26.900
I got a crazy idea. Alex is going to occupy the Alamo.

40:26.900 --> 40:28.900
I don't think that's a bad idea.

40:28.900 --> 40:30.900
This is my destiny.

40:30.900 --> 40:31.900
Leave him there.

40:31.900 --> 40:34.900
Sir, we have a group of tourists coming through. We're going to need you to leave.

40:34.900 --> 40:39.900
I'm part of the exhibit now. I am Colonel Travis.

40:39.900 --> 40:40.900
That would be great.

40:40.900 --> 40:41.900
That would be great.

40:41.900 --> 40:47.900
Late career change for Alex. Living museum display.

40:47.900 --> 40:52.900
Instead of going around with his Mark Twain show, he's just like, I am Colonel Travis.

40:52.900 --> 40:54.900
Yeah, he could just drink.

40:54.900 --> 40:55.900
I think it would be great.

40:55.900 --> 41:01.900
So now we get to Owen helming the show in studio.

41:01.900 --> 41:05.900
He's sort of just giving a little talk over the footage.

41:05.900 --> 41:10.900
He gets surprised by a little someone he sees hanging out with Alex.

41:10.900 --> 41:14.900
And Alex Jones is right there on the screen.

41:14.900 --> 41:19.900
Bullhorning the state capitol building in Atlanta, Georgia.

41:19.900 --> 41:21.900
I think that's Nick Fuentes to his left.

41:21.900 --> 41:23.900
Rob Dew there on screen as well filming.

41:23.900 --> 41:27.900
Yeah, Nick Fuentes is hanging out with Alex down in Georgia.

41:27.900 --> 41:32.900
There's Alex Jones and a Nazi standing next to him.

41:32.900 --> 41:35.900
So I think we're doing great.

41:35.900 --> 41:36.900
Having a great time.

41:36.900 --> 41:37.900
I think we're doing great.

41:37.900 --> 41:42.900
So Owen is just throwing to this video as much as he can.

41:42.900 --> 41:43.900
Sure.

41:43.900 --> 41:48.900
The globalists have been caught red-handed, engaged in massive fraud.

41:48.900 --> 41:50.900
And the people know.

41:50.900 --> 41:54.900
And the people will not accept this fraudulent election.

41:54.900 --> 41:57.900
And just like in other countries, they're none of them.

41:57.900 --> 42:02.900
We need a new election call in the disputed states.

42:02.900 --> 42:03.900
Wild.

42:03.900 --> 42:06.900
Stop the steal. Stop the steal.

42:06.900 --> 42:09.900
Ah yes, such a great constitutional plan.

42:09.900 --> 42:10.900
Ah.

42:10.900 --> 42:13.900
It's called for new elections in the states that your hero lost.

42:13.900 --> 42:17.900
This is really stupid, but for the first time in a long time, Alex makes sense.

42:17.900 --> 42:22.900
He's back to being in an opposition role to the rest of reality, which is where he belongs.

42:22.900 --> 42:23.900
Yeah.

42:23.900 --> 42:24.900
It feels...

42:24.900 --> 42:28.900
Yeah, yeah, I...

42:28.900 --> 42:31.900
They just know they want fascism.

42:31.900 --> 42:34.900
Well, they've kind of had to be blunt about it now.

42:34.900 --> 42:39.900
They can't, like with the election results in Michigan, like, okay, okay.

42:39.900 --> 42:40.900
I get you.

42:40.900 --> 42:43.900
What if we just throw out all black votes?

42:43.900 --> 42:45.900
How about that? Does that count?

42:45.900 --> 42:48.900
Would we still have an election there?

42:48.900 --> 42:49.900
Is that still good?

42:49.900 --> 42:52.900
But Alex seems right out on the street.

42:52.900 --> 42:53.900
Yeah.

42:53.900 --> 42:54.900
More what I'm talking about.

42:54.900 --> 42:55.900
You know what I'm saying?

42:55.900 --> 42:56.900
No, no, no. He's home.

42:56.900 --> 42:57.900
Yeah.

42:57.900 --> 42:58.900
He's home again.

42:58.900 --> 43:01.900
I compare things to wrestling a lot, but that's because there's a lot of similarity to the

43:01.900 --> 43:05.900
distorted reality that exists on Infowars and in the WWE.

43:05.900 --> 43:09.900
To get really basic with things, there are good guys and bad guys in wrestling.

43:09.900 --> 43:12.900
The good guy is the face, the bad guy is the heel.

43:12.900 --> 43:15.900
The ultimate goal of a feud is to have the bad guy anger the audience,

43:15.900 --> 43:19.900
whether it be by cheating in matches or having a shitty personality or whatever,

43:19.900 --> 43:23.900
to the point where the audience wants to pay to see the face kick his ass.

43:23.900 --> 43:27.900
There are variations in some middle grounds, but this is the basic dynamic.

43:27.900 --> 43:31.900
There are character types that only work as a heel or a face,

43:31.900 --> 43:35.900
and trying to make them work in an opposite alignment does not play.

43:35.900 --> 43:39.900
A cocky showboat who thinks they're too hot works as a heel but not as a face,

43:39.900 --> 43:44.900
because the things that they have to do to play their character are inherently annoying.

43:44.900 --> 43:47.900
The exception to this would be Shawn Michaels, but he was a once-in-a-generation talent

43:47.900 --> 43:50.900
and rules don't apply to people like him or Stone Cold or The Undertaker.

43:50.900 --> 43:53.900
I gotcha. It's fine. We can move on from that.

43:53.900 --> 43:59.900
Similarly, the scrappy tryhard wrestler who refuses to quit does not work as a heel.

43:59.900 --> 44:03.900
The audience watching a person take a horrible beating and still kicking out of pins

44:03.900 --> 44:06.900
makes them cheer for the underdog who won't give up.

44:06.900 --> 44:11.900
The giant they're fighting has thrown everything they have against them and they just won't stay down.

44:11.900 --> 44:14.900
People love that shit, to the point where it's such a powerful thing

44:14.900 --> 44:20.900
that it was used to turn Stone Cold's face in his match against Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13.

44:20.900 --> 44:23.900
Bret went into that match as the face, and the two had a brutal match

44:23.900 --> 44:28.900
that resulted in Bret getting Stone Cold into his submission hold, the Sharpshooter.

44:28.900 --> 44:33.900
Stone Cold was bleeding profusely from the face, and he refused to tap out to the Sharpshooter,

44:33.900 --> 44:37.900
with Bret ending up winning when Stone Cold passed out in the hold.

44:37.900 --> 44:41.900
It left an iconic image, and that performance, where he refused to give in,

44:41.900 --> 44:46.900
made it impossible for crowds not to cheer for Stone Cold, and thus he had to be a face.

44:46.900 --> 44:50.900
Consider that previous to this his gimmick had been that he was a homicidal redneck

44:50.900 --> 44:55.900
that was inspired by the emotionless serial killer Richard Kuklinski, aka the Iceman.

44:55.900 --> 45:00.900
Who among us has not turned face after being like, I like serial killers?

45:00.900 --> 45:05.900
Less than a year prior, he'd broken his former tag team partner Brian Pillman's ankle,

45:05.900 --> 45:09.900
and then was trying to invade his home to continue attacking him,

45:09.900 --> 45:12.900
which led to Pillman pulling out a gun on television to protect himself,

45:12.900 --> 45:16.900
which was super fucked up and really scared people at the time,

45:16.900 --> 45:20.900
because, well, the feed cut out right as Pillman was pulling his gun.

45:20.900 --> 45:21.900
Okay, well that's not good.

45:21.900 --> 45:23.900
No, and Stone Cold was rushing into the house.

45:23.900 --> 45:24.900
That's not good.

45:24.900 --> 45:28.900
Anyway, the point here is that there are characterizations that only work in certain contexts,

45:28.900 --> 45:32.900
and Alex Jones only works outside any connection to power.

45:32.900 --> 45:37.900
Everything becomes incoherent once he's trying to make excuses for the president who he supports,

45:37.900 --> 45:41.900
but everything is still a conspiracy, just a conspiracy that doesn't involve the president,

45:41.900 --> 45:44.900
and everyone who blindly supports said president.

45:44.900 --> 45:48.900
It's nonsensical, like trying to boo a wrestler who has too much heart to give up.

45:48.900 --> 45:50.900
It doesn't make sense.

45:50.900 --> 45:54.900
This, I think, more than anything else, has made me feel substantially better since the election,

45:54.900 --> 45:59.900
and I wanted to take a moment to address that levity that we probably have on the last couple episodes.

45:59.900 --> 46:04.900
It would be easy to get the impression that I don't think that Alex is as serious a problem anymore,

46:04.900 --> 46:07.900
or that I feel like the work is done now that Trump is out of office,

46:07.900 --> 46:08.900
and I want to make sure no one—

46:08.900 --> 46:09.900
Strongly disagree.

46:09.900 --> 46:11.900
I want to make sure no one thinks that that's where I'm coming from.

46:11.900 --> 46:12.900
Yeah.

46:12.900 --> 46:14.900
It's my job to watch Alex Jones and critique him,

46:14.900 --> 46:19.900
and for a long time he's not made actual sense from the standpoint of what his character is supposed to be,

46:19.900 --> 46:20.900
which is infuriating.

46:20.900 --> 46:21.900
Yeah.

46:21.900 --> 46:25.900
He's supposed to be the only person who can see through the elaborate communist plot to take over the country,

46:25.900 --> 46:29.900
but he's apparently also supposed to be the guy that has the president's ear,

46:29.900 --> 46:32.900
but he's also the guy who's mad that the president isn't doing everything he says.

46:32.900 --> 46:34.900
It's convoluted.

46:34.900 --> 46:40.900
The truth teller persona needs to be someone who is ignored, or is listened to by people who are perennial losers,

46:40.900 --> 46:41.900
like Ron Paul.

46:41.900 --> 46:47.900
If you don't do it that way, too many unanswerable questions come up that penetrate the facade.

46:47.900 --> 46:51.900
I'm grateful to be able to study Alex Jones during this period

46:51.900 --> 46:54.900
where his persona was completely out of sync with the reality he's trying to present,

46:54.900 --> 46:58.900
but I'm also incredibly relieved to re-enter a world where he's back where he belongs.

46:58.900 --> 47:03.900
Time will tell if he's able to pull off the transition back to that place,

47:03.900 --> 47:08.900
where he gets to yell on the street and everyone, you know, chants and stuff.

47:08.900 --> 47:09.900
Time will tell.

47:09.900 --> 47:14.900
But if he can, I have a hunch that there's a lot of money to be made off semi-red-pilled folks

47:14.900 --> 47:18.900
who find themselves unsatisfied by Fox News but think QAnon's insane.

47:18.900 --> 47:19.900
Yeah.

47:19.900 --> 47:25.900
I think that Alex could have a pretty fucking profitable time if he's able to thread the needle back.

47:25.900 --> 47:30.900
I can't believe that we're positioned in a place where it seems like all of these right-wing people

47:30.900 --> 47:36.900
are just going to slide back into their positions, but we're going to have a higher tolerance for it.

47:36.900 --> 47:37.900
You know what I'm saying?

47:37.900 --> 47:44.900
Yeah, it could be a situation where some people are going to come out of this more sanitized to normal reality.

47:44.900 --> 47:53.900
People like Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio might come off with a sheen of sensibility

47:53.900 --> 47:57.900
because they're not saying Trump should say he's the winner or whatever.

47:57.900 --> 47:58.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:58.900 --> 48:06.900
And then other people might, I think there's going to be a drastic reorganization in terms of media folk.

48:06.900 --> 48:16.900
I think that so much radicalization and so much, you know, nonsense has happened in the last four years

48:16.900 --> 48:22.900
that I don't think most people are going to be satisfied by Fox News.

48:22.900 --> 48:30.900
The audience that they have catered to I think might have progressed past the point of what they're able to create.

48:30.900 --> 48:34.900
Yeah, they radicalized them beyond a point where they can control or satisfy them.

48:34.900 --> 48:41.900
It feels like that's a real possibility and that could be an amazingly huge market for people like Alex.

48:41.900 --> 48:44.900
If they're able, like I said, if they're able to thread the needle.

48:44.900 --> 48:48.900
And I think he wants to, I think he would love to because he loves money.

48:48.900 --> 48:49.900
Yeah.

48:49.900 --> 48:51.900
And he also seems to be having just a blast.

48:51.900 --> 48:52.900
Yeah.

48:52.900 --> 48:53.900
Listen to this.

48:53.900 --> 48:57.900
This is Alex like, you know, I don't remember how free willy ends.

48:57.900 --> 49:01.900
But I imagine that it ends with that whale getting to swim in the ocean.

49:01.900 --> 49:02.900
Sure.

49:02.900 --> 49:03.900
Free.

49:03.900 --> 49:04.900
Yeah.

49:04.900 --> 49:05.900
I think he jumps over the kid too.

49:05.900 --> 49:06.900
Yes.

49:06.900 --> 49:07.900
He's very majestic.

49:07.900 --> 49:09.900
And it's really moving to see him like, you know, swimming.

49:09.900 --> 49:10.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:10.900 --> 49:12.900
This is kind of like Alex as free willy.

49:12.900 --> 49:13.900
Okay.

49:13.900 --> 49:14.900
This is just free willy.

49:14.900 --> 49:17.900
I want to salute and commit her by the shot of her today.

49:17.900 --> 49:21.900
It's going to get bigger and bigger as papers around the country see this.

49:21.900 --> 49:26.900
And I know on Saturday, you're going to be out here with at least 10,000 people.

49:26.900 --> 49:30.900
But I know to all the millions watching, we love you and we appreciate you.

49:30.900 --> 49:34.900
And we'll never give up on America for this new world order takeover.

49:34.900 --> 49:36.900
Yeah!

49:36.900 --> 49:38.900
He just gets to say nothing and people get excited.

49:38.900 --> 49:39.900
Yeah, that's great.

49:39.900 --> 49:40.900
It's awesome.

49:40.900 --> 49:41.900
That's great.

49:41.900 --> 49:42.900
He never gets to hear cheers whenever he's on the show.

49:42.900 --> 49:43.900
No.

49:43.900 --> 49:45.900
And he can just yell catchphrases and people get excited.

49:45.900 --> 49:46.900
Yeah.

49:46.900 --> 49:49.900
And I want to salute all of you that came out here today.

49:49.900 --> 49:56.900
You are just the beginning of the Second American World Order.

49:56.900 --> 50:04.900
You all are pioneers in the next wave of the Republic.

50:04.900 --> 50:11.900
Alex Jones has been right about everything.

50:11.900 --> 50:12.900
Come on, Alex.

50:12.900 --> 50:13.900
You don't need a job that bad.

50:13.900 --> 50:14.900
All right.

50:14.900 --> 50:15.900
We don't even need to.

50:15.900 --> 50:16.900
Look, look, look.

50:16.900 --> 50:18.900
Even Alex doesn't want to hear that.

50:18.900 --> 50:19.900
99% of the time, kid.

50:19.900 --> 50:20.900
He says it.

50:20.900 --> 50:22.900
You don't tell him that.

50:22.900 --> 50:23.900
Yeah.

50:23.900 --> 50:24.900
Alex can just yell these catchphrases.

50:24.900 --> 50:25.900
People get really excited.

50:25.900 --> 50:29.900
And then when he runs out of breath, he'll have someone like Ali there to tag team the

50:29.900 --> 50:30.900
mic with him.

50:30.900 --> 50:31.900
It's great.

50:31.900 --> 50:32.900
It's perfect.

50:32.900 --> 50:34.900
That's Alex swimming free in the ocean.

50:34.900 --> 50:35.900
Yeah.

50:35.900 --> 50:37.900
It's a little, you know, I can understand that.

50:37.900 --> 50:43.900
It's a little bit the difference now between doing an online comedy show for people watching

50:43.900 --> 50:46.900
a screen versus going and doing a live stand-up set.

50:46.900 --> 50:48.900
You're not going to get those same laughs, man.

50:48.900 --> 50:50.900
You go out there and do it live.

50:50.900 --> 50:51.900
That's the juice.

50:51.900 --> 50:52.900
That's the way it feels good.

50:52.900 --> 50:54.900
Yeah, perhaps, perhaps.

50:54.900 --> 50:56.900
So Nick Fuentes is there.

50:56.900 --> 50:57.900
That's the downside of doing it.

50:57.900 --> 50:58.900
That is a huge problem for me.

50:58.900 --> 50:59.900
Yeah.

50:59.900 --> 51:01.900
Downside of doing live comedy is you might get booked on a show with Nick Fuentes.

51:01.900 --> 51:02.900
That's true.

51:02.900 --> 51:03.900
All right.

51:03.900 --> 51:04.900
So he's there.

51:04.900 --> 51:08.900
And he seems like this dude's scary as hell because I can kind of see what his program

51:08.900 --> 51:09.900
is right now.

51:09.900 --> 51:15.900
And that is, so earlier he did his thing where he brought like his, his griper movement.

51:15.900 --> 51:16.900
Sure.

51:16.900 --> 51:18.900
And they started trying to embarrass Charlie Kirk.

51:18.900 --> 51:19.900
Right.

51:19.900 --> 51:22.900
And Turning Point USA at all these live events.

51:22.900 --> 51:24.900
I mean, I don't know.

51:24.900 --> 51:27.900
I feel like they won.

51:27.900 --> 51:28.900
Yeah.

51:28.900 --> 51:31.900
It seems like they pretty much beat the shit out of Turning Point USA.

51:31.900 --> 51:32.900
Yeah.

51:32.900 --> 51:34.900
I don't know how, how effective Turning Point USA is.

51:34.900 --> 51:39.900
And also another point, a point of that is also that like Charlie Kirk is getting older

51:39.900 --> 51:45.900
and his whole appeal as a college ambassador is maybe a little bit less sensible at this

51:45.900 --> 51:46.900
point.

51:46.900 --> 51:52.900
But whatever the case, I do think that, you know, he set his sights on them and whether

51:52.900 --> 51:58.900
he's responsible for them having a waning influence, he's now I think moving on to the

51:58.900 --> 51:59.900
GOP.

51:59.900 --> 52:00.900
Sure.

52:00.900 --> 52:05.900
I think that there's a target on like the actual Republican party.

52:05.900 --> 52:06.900
Yeah.

52:06.900 --> 52:10.900
And I know that a lot of people, their mentality would be like, let them fight.

52:10.900 --> 52:11.900
I understand that.

52:11.900 --> 52:17.900
But also I think if you let them fight, you run the risk of like, okay, well any gains

52:17.900 --> 52:23.900
made by people like Nick makes this a even more Nazi-ish party.

52:23.900 --> 52:24.900
Yup.

52:24.900 --> 52:26.900
Anyway, he's not happy about the GOP.

52:26.900 --> 52:30.900
The Republican party has failed us.

52:30.900 --> 52:32.900
We know there was a fraud.

52:32.900 --> 52:34.900
We saw it on election day.

52:34.900 --> 52:36.900
There is no question about it.

52:36.900 --> 52:42.900
And since election day, we have heard from our Republican representatives, absolutely

52:42.900 --> 52:44.900
nothing.

52:44.900 --> 52:47.900
Mickey Haley has said nothing.

52:47.900 --> 52:50.900
Dan Crenshaw has said nothing.

52:50.900 --> 52:55.900
Marco Rubio in fact supports Biden stealing this election.

52:55.900 --> 53:02.900
So what you have here is more or less them getting ready for Biden to win the election.

53:02.900 --> 53:03.900
Right.

53:03.900 --> 53:08.900
And then their focus will turn to inter GOP conflict.

53:08.900 --> 53:09.900
Right.

53:09.900 --> 53:15.900
This is sort of the model of the Tea Party, you know, where the fringe inside taking over

53:15.900 --> 53:16.900
the party.

53:16.900 --> 53:17.900
Yeah.

53:17.900 --> 53:20.900
Seems like they're just doing it again, but the figures that are doing it are even more

53:20.900 --> 53:21.900
extreme.

53:21.900 --> 53:22.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:22.900 --> 53:23.900
And great.

53:23.900 --> 53:26.900
And I look forward to that because this cycle doesn't seem to just repeat itself and get

53:26.900 --> 53:27.900
worse as it goes along.

53:27.900 --> 53:34.900
No, it's a testament, I think, to the true level of contempt that the GOP party operatives

53:34.900 --> 53:43.900
have towards their voters is just like, we're going to lie to them, essentially take them

53:43.900 --> 53:47.900
captive to our bullshit, and then we'll be able to control them forever.

53:47.900 --> 53:51.900
And then we'll leave them sitting ducks to demagogues like these assholes.

53:51.900 --> 53:56.900
And then all of a sudden you lose control and the mob comes after you.

53:56.900 --> 53:58.900
And you're like, no, we don't even need to worry about them.

53:58.900 --> 54:00.900
The mob is just so stupid though.

54:00.900 --> 54:03.900
You know, Nick Fuentes is going to remain on the fringe.

54:03.900 --> 54:05.900
He's never going to come in here.

54:05.900 --> 54:11.900
And in 20 years, you know, Supreme Leader Nick Fuentes is going to be great for us.

54:11.900 --> 54:12.900
Ugh.

54:12.900 --> 54:13.900
Ugh.

54:13.900 --> 54:19.900
So I'm worried about Nick Fuentes in the sense that, like, this guy is a real shithead and

54:19.900 --> 54:24.900
he's young and clearly...

54:24.900 --> 54:28.900
His box has fewer air holes in it than Alex's and Alex got rid of all of his.

54:28.900 --> 54:32.900
He has plans, you know, that's what makes him worrying to me.

54:32.900 --> 54:36.900
Though I will say that sometimes he has ideas that just don't make any sense.

54:36.900 --> 54:39.900
We want Trump! We want Trump!

54:39.900 --> 54:45.900
And if we don't get him, the trucker strike that is coming up this month is only the beginning!

54:45.900 --> 54:47.900
Yeah!

54:47.900 --> 54:52.900
I'm not sure if Nick understands his political alignment very well, but he should realize

54:52.900 --> 54:56.900
that it makes absolutely no sense for him to be calling for a strike of anything.

54:56.900 --> 55:01.900
He's either a paleoconservative or a libertarian depending on when he's answering the question

55:01.900 --> 55:06.900
and both of these political philosophies are super anti-union and super anti-strikes.

55:06.900 --> 55:08.900
We want Trump! We hate unions!

55:08.900 --> 55:16.900
And we want every trucker in United 541 to stand with us and strike against their horrible oppressors!

55:16.900 --> 55:20.900
Yeah. Typically libertarians view unions as an extortion racket,

55:20.900 --> 55:23.900
trying to get in the way of the freedom of an employer and an employee

55:23.900 --> 55:27.900
freely agreeing to terms of trading money for labor.

55:27.900 --> 55:31.900
They would likely support a worker's right to withhold their labor if the terms were unfair,

55:31.900 --> 55:34.900
but they would definitely, and I mean definitely,

55:34.900 --> 55:38.900
be way more passionate about supporting a business's right to replace that worker

55:38.900 --> 55:40.900
with someone who would accept unfair terms.

55:40.900 --> 55:44.900
That's what freedom is about, after all, according to libertarians.

55:44.900 --> 55:50.900
We are together recognizing that in the face of an overwhelming government entity

55:50.900 --> 55:54.900
the only method of fighting back we have is to unite together

55:54.900 --> 55:59.900
and all of us utilize our power to neutralize their power

55:59.900 --> 56:03.900
and that's what we call libertarianism.

56:03.900 --> 56:08.900
Great. I don't see any possible way for Nick Fuentes to coherently call for a trucker strike

56:08.900 --> 56:10.900
in order to force Trump into office.

56:10.900 --> 56:13.900
If the truckers were to strike over their disapproval about an election,

56:13.900 --> 56:17.900
Nick's political belief set should require that he support the trucking companies

56:17.900 --> 56:21.900
bringing in scabs to do the work these truckers refuse to do.

56:21.900 --> 56:25.900
It doesn't matter because this isn't a statement that's meant to make political sense,

56:25.900 --> 56:28.900
nor is it even something he can pretend would be effective.

56:28.900 --> 56:31.900
This is a line he's throwing out in hopes of incitement.

56:31.900 --> 56:34.900
He's trying to pump up the crowd and planting images in their head of their side

56:34.900 --> 56:37.900
throwing the country into chaos with truckers refusing to work

56:37.900 --> 56:40.900
unless Trump is installed as president is exciting.

56:40.900 --> 56:43.900
It's exciting for them.

56:43.900 --> 56:46.900
I mean that's the classic fucking takeover playbook though

56:46.900 --> 56:50.900
is to utilize all the power of the stuff that you hate

56:50.900 --> 56:55.900
to get yourself into power and then close the door behind you as fast as you possibly can

56:55.900 --> 56:57.900
so other people can't unionize.

56:57.900 --> 56:58.900
Sure.

56:58.900 --> 56:59.900
Like that's how you do it.

56:59.900 --> 57:00.900
Yeah.

57:00.900 --> 57:01.900
That's the game man.

57:01.900 --> 57:05.900
So they're out there and it's fun enough but there's also lulls

57:05.900 --> 57:07.900
and when there are lulls Owen's got to talk and

57:07.900 --> 57:08.900
Oh that's not good.

57:08.900 --> 57:11.900
Here he says something very unsurprising.

57:11.900 --> 57:14.900
Looking at the crowd here as they begin to march into the building

57:14.900 --> 57:20.900
people who were on the caravan with me last week who are still part of this.

57:20.900 --> 57:23.900
So Americans are ready to go.

57:23.900 --> 57:26.900
They are not going to let this election be stolen from them.

57:26.900 --> 57:30.900
There are people you recognize from the caravan because you were in Atlanta.

57:30.900 --> 57:31.900
I don't understand.

57:31.900 --> 57:35.900
No they were in the cars the whole way.

57:35.900 --> 57:39.900
So the people who are info warrior types in Atlanta

57:39.900 --> 57:41.900
are very likely to come to both of these events.

57:41.900 --> 57:45.900
Oh I don't know if they have that kind of scheduling freedom.

57:45.900 --> 57:47.900
I'm certain most of them are unemployed.

57:47.900 --> 57:50.900
That's not fair.

57:50.900 --> 57:54.900
So Owen gets talking about this Dominion conspiracy.

57:54.900 --> 57:55.900
Oh that's great.

57:55.900 --> 57:57.900
Love me a good Dominion conspiracy.

57:57.900 --> 58:01.900
Man he believes just the dumbest version of this.

58:01.900 --> 58:05.900
You know record. It can all be done off location. It can all be done remotely.

58:05.900 --> 58:07.900
It's all been proven.

58:07.900 --> 58:09.900
That's why they run with these systems.

58:09.900 --> 58:12.900
That's why they tested it with Hugo Chavez in Venezuela

58:12.900 --> 58:22.900
and then when it worked to steal elections for the communists in Venezuela it went nationwide.

58:22.900 --> 58:24.900
You don't think that had something to do with

58:24.900 --> 58:25.900
You know it's so historic.

58:25.900 --> 58:26.900
Never mind sorry.

58:26.900 --> 58:30.900
So for the record Hugo Chavez died in 2013 and won his last election in 2012.

58:30.900 --> 58:35.900
So I guess the theory here is that this company stole the 2012 Venezuela election as a test run

58:35.900 --> 58:38.900
then eight years later paid it all off with the US election.

58:38.900 --> 58:43.900
This naturally raises the question of why the globalists didn't just use it in 2016

58:43.900 --> 58:46.900
but we're playing with conspiracies so let's not bring real questions into it.

58:46.900 --> 58:48.900
They weren't ready yet.

58:48.900 --> 58:51.900
Chavez had just died in 2013. They weren't sure if it was going to work out.

58:51.900 --> 58:52.900
Three years prior.

58:52.900 --> 58:58.900
It's a mourning period. Have you not read about international and intergalactic contract law?

58:58.900 --> 59:04.900
So the conspiracy that Owen is spinning is made out of combining details about two different companies

59:04.900 --> 59:07.900
and then insisting you've proven something suspicious.

59:07.900 --> 59:10.900
The two companies at issue are Dominion and Smartmatic.

59:10.900 --> 59:14.900
Part of the way this conspiracy is presented is to claim that these are the same company

59:14.900 --> 59:17.900
or that Dominion owns Smartmatic but that's not the case.

59:17.900 --> 59:18.900
They are unrelated.

59:18.900 --> 59:22.900
Smartmatic is a company that's provided election technology in Venezuela

59:22.900 --> 59:27.900
but they actually have a history of calling out voting problems like they did in August 2017

59:27.900 --> 59:31.900
when they found that the results of the constituent assembly election had been altered

59:31.900 --> 59:34.900
which they knew because their system is tamper evident

59:34.900 --> 59:38.900
and set to quote self-report any attempt to interfere with it.

59:38.900 --> 59:42.900
Dominion has nothing to do with Venezuela so the ability to connect Venezuela with Dominion

59:42.900 --> 59:46.900
relies on connecting these two companies which are not connected and are actually competitors.

59:46.900 --> 59:52.900
It's important to remember here that the game that these people are engaging in is not to make a coherent point.

59:52.900 --> 59:56.900
Their goal is to create a perception where they're right and everyone's out to get them.

59:56.900 --> 01:00:00.900
In this case, the connection to Hugo Chavez is really telling

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:02.900
because it's not about a connection that's real.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.900
It's about tying this whole thing to a right-wing boogeyman.

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:10.900
The anti-communist right-wing view Hugo Chavez as one of the world's greatest evils

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:16.900
so involving him in this conspiracy is essentially, I don't know, fan service for weird right-wingers.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:20.900
I'm surprised they haven't just picked a bunch of the different left-wing governments

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.900
America's tried to topple over the years.

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:23.900
Why not?

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.900
No, no, no. Because Hugo Chavez is high profile.

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.900
Oh, that's true.

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:35.900
And he's a figure that most, like, Fox News watchers would be familiar with as a heel.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.900
As a boogeyman, yeah. As a heel, if you will.

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:43.900
Yeah, so he's almost the perfect person to use as almost like a signifier.

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:46.900
And he's dead so it's not like he's going to come at you.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.900
Sure. I don't know how he would sue anyway, but...

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.900
I don't think he was interested in suing Dan.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:57.900
So in this next clip, this is where I just kind of lost my patience with Owen.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:03.900
We're going to pick up the live stream from the Capitol again in about a half an hour.

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:10.900
I've got other news I'm going to get to as well as video reports in the meantime.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.900
Boy, I mean, it's just so...

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:18.900
Do I go down the fake pandemic and everything they're doing with the torture, psychological torture?

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.900
I'm speaking as a producer here.

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:23.900
Infowars is currently in a no-win situation.

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:28.900
You basically have two main event players in the entire company with Alex and Owen.

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:33.900
Owen sucks and all that, but compared to the rest of these zeroes, he's basically Dominique Wilkins,

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.900
which I say because Alex is in Atlanta.

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.900
There are two roles that currently need to be filled.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.900
One is in studio and one is remote.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:45.900
And because there are only two people who can reasonably fill those roles, they have to do those jobs.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:49.900
With two roles and two people, there are only two possibilities of how to organize things,

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:51.900
which is both trash in terms of presentation.

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:55.900
One option is having Alex in studio and Owen on the road.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:02:00.900
This is good because Alex is much, much better as a broadcaster, and he knows how to move the products.

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:04.900
And he can say nothing passionately for an hour.

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:11.900
The downside, however, is that Owen is not a draw, so you end up with really lackluster, disappointing remote events.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.900
Even on his best day, Owen can't get a crowd revved up like Alex.

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:18.900
Alex is old school on a bullhorn, and Owen is just a pretender.

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:23.900
The other option is what we have here, where Owen is in studio and Alex is on the road.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:27.900
The upshot here is that you probably get more compelling video from the road,

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:30.900
because Alex is probably drunk, and he knows how to get people pumped up.

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:34.900
More people are also going to show up, naturally, if Alex Jones is somewhere,

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:36.900
compared to if Owen Schroyer is there.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:37.900
He's a sideshow.

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:41.900
Yeah, so if the goal is optics of large crowds, you really need Alex there.

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:47.900
At the same time, you run into problems with the show itself, because Owen's just not that good as a host.

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:51.900
It's so goddamn boring, and I can't imagine he's moving any pills.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.900
He says something like,

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:56.900
we'll get back to the feeds of Alex and Allie in half an hour,

01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.900
and all I can think is, well, here comes a shitty half hour.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.900
This is a substitute teacher showing a movie.

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:08.900
And the movie is Alex yelling into a bullhorn, and sometimes that movie stops.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.900
Yeah, and you're like, what do we do now? Let's play Heads Up, Seven Up.

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:15.900
No, let's listen to Owen talk for a half hour? No, fuck that noise.

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:19.900
It's a tough situation if you're in charge at Infos and you have to figure out how to assign roles,

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:24.900
but if it were me, I would never have Alex out of studio.

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:29.900
He may draw a bigger crowd, but there are going to be a ton of people in Atlanta no matter what,

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:34.900
and Owen isn't as exciting as Alex, but combined with Allie Alexander and Nick Fuentes,

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:38.900
it might end up not being as poorly attended as the caravan.

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:42.900
You need Alex in studio for multiple reasons.

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:46.900
The first is that he's the only person exciting enough to make this dumb show watchable,

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:49.900
and thus make people more likely to buy the pills.

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:53.900
There's a financial reality that Alex is better for business as the host.

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:58.900
Then, on top of that, the whole point of Infowars right now is that shit is super dangerous.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:02.900
Antifa and Black Lives Matter are trying to kill all the conservatives.

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:06.900
Remember a few months ago, Alex said that China and MS-13 had teamed up with the Democrats

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:10.900
to take out conservative talk show hosts? Legitimately, no.

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.900
He did. In hindsight, that narrative makes a lot more sense

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.900
if we imagine that Alex is just an out-of-control stimulant addict.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:17.900
Yeah, that would make sense.

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:23.900
Anyway, I would advise Infowars to lean into this whole thing and make the studio feel like Alex's bunker.

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:26.900
The whole point of his career is supposed to be that he's the oracle,

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:30.900
the only person in the world who can see directly through the globalist plans.

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:33.900
The literal devil has been trying to enlist him since he was a child

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:36.900
because the devil knew that Alex was special and he was a psychic.

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:41.900
If you expect me to believe any of that, you have to protect that person at all costs.

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:45.900
The psychic who's the only person who knows what the globalists are going to do before they do it

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:51.900
is way too valuable to have out on the street yelling into a bullhorn with a couple of young enterprising bigots.

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:53.900
Yeah, that's not the best military tactics I would suggest.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:54.900
No, no, no!

01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:55.900
I would say.

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.900
Now that Infowars has become something so comical and hyper important,

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:00.900
it's time for them to get right with the script.

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:04.900
Alex is supposed to be this all-important guru, so he needs to start acting like it.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:08.900
The studio's already established as having guns everywhere and being super well protected,

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.900
so Alex should only be making appearances from there.

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:14.900
Owen is the young gun, the warrior in the fold,

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:18.900
so he needs to be Alex's proxy on the streets, willing to risk it all

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:23.900
because he knows that his muscles and physical form are all that he has to give to the Infowar.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:24.900
That's true.

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:26.900
I'm going to move on now because I'm getting lost in flights of fancy

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.900
about the ideal direction for Infowars to go in the future,

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:30.900
and again, as we touched on at the beginning of the show,

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:33.900
we keep coming up with better ideas for them and then they just don't do it.

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:36.900
I've got you beat by a mile.

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:38.900
No, no, can I tell you one of my other things before you do it?

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:39.900
Sure, sure, sure. Go for it.

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:43.900
So they like to try and present Harrison Smith as like the smart research guy.

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:44.900
Sure.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:47.900
So I just had this image of him like every single fucking time you're on camera,

01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:51.900
you'd be peeking out from behind a comically large book.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:54.900
With glasses all the way on the tip of your nose.

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.900
Yes, and wear a fucking robe.

01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.900
Yeah, totally. Totally. What are we doing here?

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:01.900
Like, why not?

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:05.900
Bring Joe Biggs back in and have him always have grease on him somewhere

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.900
because he's like a mechanic type or something.

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:09.900
Yeah, look like a monk.

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.900
He's a monk in there. He's got the...

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.900
Joe Biggs has been fixing cars.

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:15.900
Yeah, always, always been fixing cars.

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:17.900
Turn this into an episode of Taxi.

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:20.900
That's what I want. Danny DeVito should be hired by Infowars.

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:25.900
Why not? At this point, just fucking, like, nothing that they say is real,

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:29.900
so why not make all the characters actual fun characters?

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:30.900
Yeah, that'd be fun.

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.900
Christopher Lloyd could be involved. He's still alive.

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:36.900
Alex, I know you're listening. I don't think you're listening,

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:40.900
but if you're listening, I will quit doing this show in order to produce

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:42.900
the next season of Infowars.

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:45.900
I've got you beat by a mile, Dan, and it's...

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:47.900
I'll bring you in as a co-executive producer.

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.900
It's easy. It's easy.

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:55.900
How can Alex be in both places at once, you ask yourself?

01:06:55.900 --> 01:07:01.900
Why are you wasting money on a fucking tank when you could have a hologram?

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:02.900
Yeah, that's interesting.

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:07.900
Harrison Smith comes with you, puts the little hologram Alex on the floor.

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:11.900
He's got a fake bullhorn. He does the whole thing remotely,

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:13.900
maybe does a little moonwalk.

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:16.900
I assume that they're going to mix the Michael Jackson hologram

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.900
with his to look a little bit better.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:20.900
With a record, you'd still need a recording, though.

01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:21.900
That's true.

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.900
Alex's time would still be strained that way.

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:25.900
I could sing Beat It for a while.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:26.900
Yeah, you certainly could.

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:28.900
Beat it.

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.900
No one wants to be defeated.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:34.900
Show them how funky...

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:39.900
Give them a hologram saxophone, just...

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:41.900
I could see it.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:45.900
So, yeah, I just think that there's intrinsic problems with people

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.900
in the roles that they're in.

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:52.900
Like, they can do specific things to a certain level of competence.

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:56.900
And unfortunately, Alex can do multiple things,

01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:00.900
but the other people he has can't.

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:04.900
And the only way to maximize everybody's skill sets

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:07.900
is to have them all start playing characters.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:11.900
And in order for this to feel right, Alex can never be out of studio.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:14.900
I know that he wants to be, and it is, like I said,

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:18.900
his free willy natural environment to be out there yelling into a bullhorn,

01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:20.900
but that's not his place anymore.

01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.900
Yeah, right. I mean, it is a little bit, though,

01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:26.900
that none of them really understand who they are,

01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:29.900
because they all think that they're way better than who they are.

01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:30.900
Yes.

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:33.900
They all think that they're Paul Revere or some shit.

01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:37.900
Everyone who works at Infowars is Lance Stevenson.

01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:40.900
They think that they're fucking Kevin Durant.

01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:41.900
Okay.

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:43.900
But you're still Lance Stevenson, okay?

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:45.900
You're gonna blow in Lebron's ear.

01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:47.900
That's your job. That's all you've got.

01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.900
It's not gonna score 20 a night. It's just not gonna happen, man.

01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:54.900
You're a dick. Play your role.

01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:59.900
It would be better, I think, for everybody if they did play their roles.

01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:00.900
Totally.

01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:04.900
And, God, it would just be more funny for me, too.

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:05.900
It'd be great.

01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:09.900
But then that goes back to everybody would have to have

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:13.900
a base level of competence that just simply doesn't exist.

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:15.900
And we can't wheel it into existence.

01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:18.900
But they could if they focused.

01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:22.900
Okay, then everybody requires a base level of focus that does not exist.

01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:26.900
The reason that Owen probably hasn't gotten better at going out

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:30.900
and doing these road things is because he also has to do the war room.

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:31.900
Right.

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:34.900
He has to wear these multiple hats.

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:38.900
Obviously, if he spent all his time focusing on, like,

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:42.900
all right, how do we manipulate crowds to the best of our ability?

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:43.900
Sure.

01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:45.900
That shots work best in field pieces.

01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:46.900
Right.

01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:49.900
If he really studied his craft and really tried to hone that,

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.900
he could be an amazing tool for Alex to use

01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:55.900
while Alex is the guru in studio.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:56.900
Yeah.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:57.900
Doing what he does best.

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:58.900
Right.

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:03.900
And if he had other employees that he had just work in specific areas

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:07.900
to be like, you are the person that I need to cover tech shit.

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:08.900
Sure.

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:09.900
Because I don't understand tech stuff.

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:10.900
Right.

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:12.900
You, Harrison Smith, you have glasses, you look like a dweeb.

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:13.900
Yeah.

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:14.900
We need you for that.

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:15.900
Do it.

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:16.900
Step into it.

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:17.900
Yeah.

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:18.900
It's kind of what Alex tried to do with, like, Mike Adams.

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:19.900
Mm-hmm.

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.900
Whenever there's a health story, we got the health ranger,

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:24.900
you know, that can be the reliable voice on that front.

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:25.900
Sure, sure, sure.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:26.900
He needs that.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.900
He needs the people who fit the tool,

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:32.900
or are the tools for the jobs that need to be done.

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:35.900
Yeah, but that would require Alex to have any interest

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:41.900
in in-house talent development, which it seems he has strenuously avoided.

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:45.900
Well, yeah, because I think he's trying to go for these cheap pops.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:46.900
Yeah, and no one is.

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.900
Someone like Ali Alexander or Nick Fuentes,

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:52.900
it's like, all right, you're trying to capitalize on whatever audience

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:53.900
they already have.

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:54.900
Exactly.

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:56.900
But they're also using you.

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:57.900
Yep.

01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.900
And it's not going to work out in any kind of long run.

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:00.900
Yeah.

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:05.900
Yeah, it's a bad strategy, and I hate to keep giving him advice,

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.900
but yeah, you need to develop some talent.

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:08.900
He hasn't.

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:09.900
And it's too late, probably.

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:13.900
Has anybody he's had on camera in our entire time period improved?

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:15.900
Do you know what I'm saying?

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:19.900
I think Owen has some, but that's because he was super green

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:20.900
in the beginning.

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:25.900
I mean, other than a more increased, I suppose, professionalism,

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:28.900
as opposed to being like, although at the same time,

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:31.900
he was like fucking Hammer and Sickle and all that shit.

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:32.900
I'm not saying he's good.

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.900
No, he's not good.

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:36.900
Okay, maybe Millie Weaver, but that's also just because

01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:38.900
the first time we saw her, she was Rainbow Snatch.

01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:39.900
That's true.

01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:40.900
And that stopped.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:41.900
It's hard to come back from that.

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:44.900
Yeah, no, I don't think that there's a lot of proficiency

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:48.900
and skill development going on at Info Wars,

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:52.900
but here's what I would say is one of the main problems.

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:59.900
It's such a singular Alex Jones-focused world that you have people like Owen

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:03.900
trying to host the show, and he's clearly trying to be Alex.

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:04.900
Totally.

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:07.900
I feel that, oh my gosh, you've got Democrats.

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:12.900
You know, I'm going to try not to yell and scream

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:13.900
and get frustrated today.

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:17.900
It's just Democrats are the most disingenuous scum

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:23.900
I've ever seen in my life, and it's just so sick.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:25.900
That's just a bad Alex impression.

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:26.900
No kidding.

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:30.900
One of his fake breakdowns with long pauses for dramatic effect.

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:32.900
He's just doing the exact same thing that Alex does,

01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:34.900
but it comes so falsely.

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:36.900
Yeah, it's way less believable.

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:37.900
Yeah.

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:38.900
He's a bad actor.

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.900
No, he needs to find his own lane, his own voice.

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:44.900
He's like a comic doing someone else's delivery, basically.

01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:46.900
It's tragic.

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:51.900
Because you have stuff like that, and that just falls fucking flat.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.900
And then it goes to commercial, and Alex is back,

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.900
and he's doing shit like this, and you're like,

01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:59.900
holy shit, you're running circles around people.

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:01.900
Who do you think's up in that blimp?

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.900
I'll tell you who.

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:05.900
He's been sitting over us for like 30 minutes.

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:10.900
Brian Stelter, punky-dumpty, is out there surveilling us in that.

01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:13.900
Listen, I'm not saying he's a child molester.

01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:14.900
I'm just saying I wouldn't let him pick my kids,

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.900
and he looks like a child molester.

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:17.900
What are you going to do?

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:19.900
What is this, Aeon Flux?

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:22.900
Everybody's floating in fucking dirigibles above us,

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:23.900
watching everything?

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:24.900
What are you talking about?

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.900
Owen's in studio doing a bad Alex impression,

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:28.900
then you cut to Alex in the field.

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:31.900
He's accusing Brian Stelter of stalking him by blimp.

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.900
Democrats are just the most disingenuous people.

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:40.900
I think God is in a blimp shitting on all of us right now!

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.900
I mean, what do you do with this?

01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:45.900
It is like watching Michael Jordan.

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.900
You're like, he's just too good.

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.900
Owen, just fucking sit down.

01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:51.900
Sit down.

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:52.900
You're Horace Grant.

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:54.900
You're not even Scottie Piffer.

01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:55.900
Get the fuck out of here.

01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:57.900
There's a part of me that kind of,

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:00.900
I mean, Alex is wrong, and he's a monster,

01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:04.900
but there is a part of me that if he's frustrated with his staff,

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:05.900
I get it.

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:06.900
Yeah.

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:07.900
They're not good.

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:08.900
No.

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:10.900
He can do all of these things better than them,

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:11.900
and I guess he should be able to.

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:12.900
Sure.

01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:13.900
He's 26 years into this career.

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:14.900
For sure, for sure.

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:17.900
I mean, Owen started at Infowars in 2016,

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:20.900
so it makes sense that he would be better,

01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:22.900
but it's embarrassing the level of better.

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:23.900
It is.

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.900
And he's doing a really bad job of fostering

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:32.900
and sort of mentoring them in terms of whatever skills they have

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:33.900
not being emphasized,

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:37.900
if only illustrated by the fact that Owen's just doing an Alex impression.

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:38.900
Yeah.

01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:43.900
Well, I mean, it's like Trump and his whole administration and shit.

01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:46.900
It's like, I just,

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:50.900
you bear the responsibility for hiring shitty people.

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:51.900
You do.

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:52.900
That's part of your job.

01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:54.900
Yeah, that's the administrative responsibility.

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:58.900
Yeah, and if they're shitty, you bear responsibility for not improving them

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:00.900
or even seemingly attempting to.

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:03.900
Yeah, that's why there's performance reviews in a lot of normal work environments.

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:04.900
Yeah.

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.900
So, yeah, this is all Alex's fault.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:07.900
Oh, sure.

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:08.900
I mean, the buck stops there,

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:13.900
but just in terms of pretending this is a chaotic environment

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:20.900
where it's just perform Alex's just running circles.

01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:25.900
It's almost outrageous watching this episode,

01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:27.900
the difference that you see.

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:28.900
Yeah.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:32.900
It's like I want to give a round of applause

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:34.900
that he thinks Brian Stelter is stalking him in a balloon.

01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:35.900
That is pretty great.

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:36.900
That's hilarious.

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:37.900
That's really great.

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:38.900
That's really funny.

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:39.900
Yeah.

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:41.900
Not as good as a Dalek with a gun, but it's still good.

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:42.900
No.

01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:43.900
It's still good.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:44.900
Yeah, I do like the image, though.

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:45.900
It's out of note.

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:46.900
Because I see-

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:47.900
Brian Stelter's got binoculars.

01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:51.900
I see the Hindenburg level where it's a giant blimp

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:56.900
and he's down and he's fucking, he's got a ship's captain vibe to him.

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:58.900
He's doing that whole thing, looking out the window,

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.900
just leaning down, just being like that motherfucker again.

01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:06.900
He's bought the hat that Alex wore on Halloween years back.

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:07.900
He's wearing it.

01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:09.900
He's playing Flight of the Valkyries while-

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:15.900
Yeah, with one of those sextant.

01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:17.900
I don't know.

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:21.900
Well, as we all know, Brian Stelter only navigates by stars.

01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:22.900
Yes.

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:26.900
So, I mean, Alex is coming in with this just dunking on Owen,

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:29.900
being like, Brian Stelter's stalking me.

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:34.900
And then, he's so good at this that he's even doing commercials from the road.

01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:36.900
He's doing commercials from- God damn it.

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:39.900
Right outside Atlanta is the Georgia Guidestones, ladies and gentlemen.

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:43.900
So, we're here covering all this, trying to stop the steal,

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:45.900
educating people about what's really happening.

01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:48.900
And the only way I could bring a security team with Antifa

01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:50.900
and Black Lives Matter threat here, and they're strong here,

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:52.900
the only way we could be here to cover all this

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.900
and to seriously focus on what's happening is your financial support.

01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.900
So, I want to thank you all for going to Infowarsstore.com,

01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.900
getting great t-shirts, books, films, water filtration,

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:02.900
and then all the great supplements.

01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:04.900
These are the highest quality, highest end supplements.

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.900
When I forget to take them, I really feel it.

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:08.900
I'm sorry, it burns the candle at both ends.

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:10.900
And without DNA Force Plus-

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:11.900
So, yeah, he just goes into a net.

01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:12.900
Yeah.

01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:13.900
It's remarkable.

01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:14.900
Effortless.

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:17.900
He even recognizes that probably Owen's not doing a good enough job

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:21.900
of pushing the product, selling things to keep things afloat.

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:26.900
So, he knows that it's his job to not only go out there to draw a crowd

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:29.900
to make the optics that they need to push this argument

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:32.900
that the people are demanding Georgia flip,

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:38.900
but he also needs to get on air and add pivot to try and sell pills.

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:44.900
I mean, the weight of the Infowar is squarely on his shoulders.

01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:46.900
Yeah, I really don't understand how-

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:48.900
See, that's the other thing that I don't understand.

01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:50.900
How is Owen not self-imb-

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:54.900
Like, do you think he watches clips of his own-

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:59.900
Like, when I was doing stand-up, I would listen to my sets over and over.

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:03.900
I would watch myself do sets, and I would critique my performance.

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.900
You know he doesn't do any of that shit.

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:07.900
But, like, what's the incentive to?

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:13.900
Exactly. Be good at your job. I feel like that's a good incentive.

01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:16.900
I feel like Owen could probably make a pretty decent argument

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.900
that he's as good as he needs to be.

01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.900
He has a show on Infowars.

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:21.900
Sure.

01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:28.900
It's basically the top of the, like, commercial conspiracy bullshit world.

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:32.900
Like, in terms of that media, it's a job.

01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:37.900
You get paid. You're on Infowars with Alex Jones.

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:39.900
Yeah, but that's like somebody saying, like,

01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:43.900
oh man, I have always dreamt of playing triple-A ball,

01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:45.900
and I made it, and now I'm done.

01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:49.900
Like, don't you want to get to the show, man? Come on!

01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:52.900
But the dark reality is, for him, this is the show.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.900
That's true. Ooh, that is a dark reality.

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:55.900
Yeah.

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:58.900
Because, like, for us, we're looking at it, it's like,

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.900
oh, you could work for a real outlet.

01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:02.900
That would be, like, the equivalent of going to the majors.

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:03.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:05.900
But that's not the way he looks at it.

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:06.900
That's true.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.900
That's not the way the people in this sphere look at it.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:12.900
The only place to go up would maybe be Breitbart,

01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:13.900
and that's probably not even.

01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:14.900
No.

01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:16.900
Like, you could work for Drudge, but Drudge is out of pocket now,

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:17.900
so you can't do that.

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.900
Yeah, Drudge isn't a home for you.

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:21.900
OAN maybe, but that's kind of a lateral move.

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:22.900
And they don't want you.

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:23.900
Probably not.

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:25.900
Their hosts are boring, but in a different way.

01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:27.900
They might want Owen, but not Alex.

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:28.900
Yeah, that's definitely true.

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.900
Well, you could work for Rebel Media, but then again,

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:31.900
that's another lateral move.

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:32.900
Sure.

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:34.900
He's about at the top of the mountain.

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:35.900
That's sad.

01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:36.900
That is really sad.

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:37.900
Owen's peaked.

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:39.900
That's really, really, really sad.

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:40.900
I'm bummed.

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:41.900
Yeah.

01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:42.900
I'm bummed.

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:45.900
I can't wait to have him pump my gas someday.

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:49.900
And to your question about, like, why doesn't Owen get better,

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:53.900
one of the issues is whatever you accept becomes acceptable.

01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:57.900
And if you can get away with just doing this,

01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:59.900
why not always do this?

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:01.900
Oh, man.

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:04.900
I still sometimes wake up in the middle of the night

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:07.900
and I'm thinking about bits that I've done

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:09.900
and been like, how can I improve those?

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:11.900
I'm probably never going to do standup again.

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:13.900
There are stories all across the nation,

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:15.900
including where I found this story today.

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:17.900
I was doing a deep dive into this where the headline is

01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:20.900
from a black lady, goodwill ambassador,

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.900
who hates white people with the headline,

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:24.900
should white boys still be allowed to talk?

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:30.900
That's in the Dixonian at Dixon College in Pennsylvania.

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:32.900
You're allowed to be racist against white people.

01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:34.900
Deep dive, Owen did on this.

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:36.900
Did he read it, Dan?

01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:38.900
Well, there's a couple important points I need to make.

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:39.900
Okay.

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:43.900
First, this essay that Owen found today on this show,

01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:47.900
he's complaining about, it was published in February 2019

01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:50.900
by the student newspaper at Dickinson College,

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:52.900
a school with an enrollment just over 2,400.

01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:54.900
It was written by a guest writer,

01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:57.900
and it's obviously making a point that conversation in classes

01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:01.900
in the writer's experience are dominated by white male voices.

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:02.900
Sure.

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:03.900
From the essay, quote,

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:04.900
in my time at Dickinson,

01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:07.900
I've listened to probably hundreds of white boys talk.

01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:08.900
It feels incessant.

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:11.900
From classes and lectures to the news and politics,

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:13.900
there's an endless line of white boys

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:16.900
waiting to share their opinions on the state of feminism in America,

01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:20.900
whether the LGBTQ plus population finally has enough rights,

01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:22.900
the merits of capitalism, et cetera.

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:26.900
The list of what white boys think they're qualified to talk about is endless.

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:28.900
Something very few of them seem to understand is that

01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:32.900
their ill-informed, uncritical opinions do not constitute truth.

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:34.900
It's kind of funny, actually,

01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:38.900
because the essay itself explains why Owen being offended by this essay is nonsense.

01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:40.900
Is exactly why he is, yeah.

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:43.900
Quote, the second thing most white boys seem not to understand

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:46.900
is that they do not exist separate from the rest of the world.

01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:47.900
You do not speak alone.

01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:51.900
You speak with the weight of every other white man who has spoken over a woman,

01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:54.900
erased the contributions of queer people from history,

01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:57.900
or denigrated broken English as unintelligent.

01:21:57.900 --> 01:21:58.900
No, no, no, no.

01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:01.900
When a black person does something, all black people are responsible for it,

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:06.900
but as we all know, a white person is an individual and cannot be held against.

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:09.900
You speak with the weight of policies and laws meant to forever define intelligence

01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:13.900
by how it measures up to the bros of America.

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:15.900
As is made clear in the final paragraph of this essay,

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:18.900
this is about Black History Month and how the writer doesn't approve

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:22.900
of overvaluing white opinions, particularly when it's to the exclusion

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:25.900
of other, quote, buried or ignored voices.

01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:29.900
Speaking as a white boy, I don't take any offense at this perspective.

01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:33.900
The style of writing seems to me very intentionally to be confrontational

01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:36.900
because it's an opinion piece about how her perspective and voice

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:39.900
were being relegated as being less important than others,

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.900
so rhetorically it works for the writing to be kind of brusque.

01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:43.900
Totally.

01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:44.900
It's stylistically sensible.

01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:47.900
No, as somebody with a partner who teaches high school, believe me,

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:49.900
white boys talk too much.

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:56.900
And I don't think, like, obviously this isn't this person making the argument

01:22:56.900 --> 01:22:59.900
that white people should never be able to talk.

01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:04.900
It's just a perspective of all this conversation on campus

01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:08.900
seems so much about issues that are unrelated to their experience.

01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:12.900
White males seem to take priority and precedence.

01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:17.900
Now, the other thing I would say is that the headline of this is

01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:19.900
Should White Boys Be Allowed to Talk?

01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:24.900
And I know from my time when I used to write for my campus paper,

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:27.900
generally editors write the headlines.

01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:31.900
This person who wrote this article probably didn't write that headline,

01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:36.900
and she's being lambasted for the headline.

01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:40.900
The headline is more extreme than the actual article is.

01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.900
And if you're an editor trying to get more-

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:43.900
Exactly.

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:46.900
Then you would make an extreme headline so people would grab their attention.

01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:47.900
Yeah, yeah.

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:50.900
It's, uh, I don't know.

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:55.900
It's a willful misunderstanding of the point that was being made in this student newspaper.

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:59.900
And the right-wing media did a cycle with this back in 2019.

01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:00.900
They already did this.

01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:02.900
Yeah, it's a yearly thing.

01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:04.900
It's like Christmas season.

01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:05.900
It's 21 months ago.

01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:07.900
It wasn't last year.

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:09.900
Who said it was an annual thing?

01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:10.900
It is a yearly thing.

01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:13.900
It speaks volumes that Owen Schroyer decided to spend time on the show

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:18.900
complaining about this college newspaper opinion piece from over a year and a half ago

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:22.900
because he wants to whine about how bad it is and it's tough to be white.

01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:24.900
It's just very sad.

01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:25.900
I just want to throw things.

01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:29.900
It's remarkable.

01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:31.900
That length needs to be gone to.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:32.900
Yeah.

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:41.900
I would argue that the person who is furious about an op-ed piece in a student newspaper

01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:47.900
that is thousands of miles away from him is the saddest person.

01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:48.900
Very sad.

01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:49.900
Yeah.

01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:52.900
Now, we go back to Alex out there, Bullhornin'.

01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:53.900
He's chanting.

01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:54.900
He's getting some chants going.

01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:55.900
Sure.

01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:56.900
There's some Stop the Steal chants.

01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:57.900
Are we going to do any locker ups?

01:24:57.900 --> 01:24:58.900
I feel like locker up never goes that style.

01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:00.900
No, I don't think there's any locker ups that I heard.

01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:02.900
But there's definitely some USAs.

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:04.900
Quite a few of them.

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:07.900
And then we get another surprise guest appearance.

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:10.900
Let's go back to the state capitol in Atlanta.

01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:13.900
He's outside now with a big crowd, Bullhorning.

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:15.900
Special session now.

01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:17.900
Special session now.

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:18.900
Special session now.

01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:20.900
Special session now.

01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:22.900
Special session now.

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:24.900
Special session now.

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:26.900
Special session now.

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:27.900
Special session now.

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:29.900
Hey, right guy?

01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:31.900
Good job being here, brother.

01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:32.900
Appreciate you, man.

01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:34.900
Enrique Tarrio enters the picture.

01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:36.900
Cool!

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.900
Enrique Tarrio and the Proud Boys have shown up

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:40.900
with Alex and Nick Fuentes

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:42.900
and Ali Alexander turning this into a

01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:44.900
real fucked up place.

01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:47.900
It's the Washington Generals of

01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:49.900
conservative propagandists.

01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:51.900
Yeah. But, so Alex is out there

01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:54.900
he's got this special session now chant going

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:56.900
and I've been pretty, you know,

01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:59.900
effusive in my praise

01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:01.900
for Alex out on the street and his ability

01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:03.900
to rile up a crowd.

01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:05.900
But here is the point where I have to point out

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:07.900
that he is only human.

01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:09.900
And he cannot get any chant going that he wants to.

01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:12.900
Because things fizzle out a little bit

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:14.900
and Owen goes back to him

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:16.900
and there's a little bit of a different picture.

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:19.900
Let's go back live now, Alex Jones on the PA.

01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:27.900
Joe Allen is a communist Chinese agent.

01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:31.900
Joe Allen is a communist Chinese agent.

01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:33.900
This is not a joke.

01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:37.900
America is in grave danger.

01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:39.900
Do you think he was trying to

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:41.900
start that as a chant? I think he was.

01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:43.900
Man, that's a long thing to chant.

01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:45.900
Well, yeah. With a bad meter?

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.900
That's not good. No, it's not.

01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:49.900
I think he was. I think he was trying to get it going.

01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:51.900
That's bad. And also you can just hear

01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:53.900
there's just, it's flattened.

01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:55.900
There isn't wooing anymore.

01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:58.900
The rally is over.

01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:00.900
Those things have a time limit.

01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:02.900
It's true. People can only yell so much.

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:04.900
You can only chant for so long. Sure.

01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:06.900
So Owen wants to make an analogy here.

01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:09.900
He's talking about these globalists, right?

01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:11.900
They're like bullies who steal your lunch money.

01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:13.900
Right? But they don't want you

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:15.900
to talk about how they're bullying them

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:17.900
and how some people might bully them.

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.900
Their analogies are spectacular.

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:21.900
This analogy stinks.

01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:23.900
I try to make analogies here.

01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:25.900
Try. You try.

01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:27.900
So people can understand.

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:29.900
Because I don't know if people can understand

01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:31.900
what I'm saying half the time.

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:33.900
It's like, is it just in my head this makes sense?

01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:35.900
Or is this translating on air?

01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:39.900
If you're in the

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:43.900
high school lunch room

01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:45.900
and there's a guy going around

01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:49.900
stealing everybody's lunch money.

01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:51.900
Everybody's like, where's all my lunch money going?

01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:53.900
This is weird.

01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.900
And then you're like, hey uh,

01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:57.900
Steve over there

01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:59.900
has been going around

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.900
stealing everybody's lunch money.

01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:03.900
I gotta pause it real quick because

01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:05.900
I didn't realize the first time

01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:07.900
I listened through this that

01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:09.900
he's imagining a scenario where this guy

01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:11.900
is stealthily stealing everyone's money

01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:13.900
as opposed to... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:15.900
It's a pickpocket.

01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:17.900
This is a high school pickpocket bully.

01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:19.900
Yeah, it's a high school bully cat burglar

01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:21.900
pickpocket.

01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:23.900
And then Steve comes up to you

01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:25.900
and says, hey man,

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:27.900
don't say that. That's hateful against me.

01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:29.900
That could lead to violence against me.

01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:31.900
Well hold on a second, Steve.

01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:33.900
You're the one that stole all the lunch money.

01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:35.900
That's who the globalists are.

01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:37.900
That's who the Democrats are.

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:39.900
That's who the mainstream media is.

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:41.900
They've stolen your country.

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:43.900
They've stolen your integrity.

01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:45.900
They've stolen your freedom.

01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:47.900
They've stolen your reality.

01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:49.900
They've stolen everything.

01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:51.900
They've stolen your future.

01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:53.900
They've stolen your children's future.

01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:55.900
They've stolen our education system.

01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:57.900
They have taken from us

01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:59.900
everything except the very breath

01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:01.900
from our mouths and now they're

01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:03.900
coming for that too with a stupid

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:05.900
face mask.

01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:07.900
And so you just point the finger

01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:09.900
and say, you've committed these crimes.

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:11.900
You've committed these atrocities.

01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:13.900
You're trying to make us a slave.

01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:15.900
You're lying to us. You're dividing us.

01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:17.900
You're gaslighting us. You're instigating

01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:19.900
us. You're doing it. And they say,

01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:21.900
don't say that. That could lead to violence

01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:23.900
against us. Well, you know what?

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:25.900
Maybe you deserve what's coming.

01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:27.900
There we go. You ever thought about that?

01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:29.900
Oh wait, they have. That's why they're so

01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:31.900
scared.

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:33.900
Did you really think we would just take

01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:37.900
actions?

01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:39.900
You usually thought you could control the mobs?

01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:43.900
No.

01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:45.900
No.

01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:47.900
That analogy that Owen used

01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:49.900
is not great, but I think I get the point.

01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:51.900
Owen understands that his position

01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:53.900
in life and his career is to be a stochastic

01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:55.900
terrorist and work really hard

01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:57.900
to inspire people to enact violence on his

01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:59.900
enemies, but he doesn't feel like he's

01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:01.900
wrong to do that because he's decided

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:03.900
his enemies deserve it, his imagined enemies.

01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:05.900
That's not surprising to

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.900
hear, and honestly it's a theme that kind of runs

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:09.900
underneath a lot of Infowars programming,

01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:11.900
but it's weird to hear Owen be so

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:13.900
blunt about those feelings of wanting mob

01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:15.900
violence. Seems like a bad move.

01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:17.900
You guys stole everything

01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:19.900
and I want everybody to

01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:21.900
solve this problem and you deserve

01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:23.900
violence, so I think we all know how we want everyone

01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:25.900
to solve this problem. It seems like a really bad move,

01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:27.900
particularly because we've done this enough times

01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:29.900
to know that should anything happen

01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:31.900
they'll call it a false flag.

01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:33.900
Also, it's almost

01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:35.900
impressive to me how much that rant

01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:37.900
felt forced.

01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:39.900
The emotion felt ungenuine,

01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:41.900
but in a completely different way than the falseness

01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:43.900
of Alex's outbursts. Alex

01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:45.900
is way over the top, growling

01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:47.900
and fake crying, almost like a clown's

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.900
take on performing an emotion.

01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:51.900
When Owen gets rolling, it feels way

01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:53.900
too much like he's thinking in his head,

01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:55.900
alright, now it's time to get intense.

01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:57.900
You can almost hear him trying to figure out what to talk

01:30:57.900 --> 01:30:59.900
about next. It's a really boring

01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:01.900
version of insincerity, and I just

01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:03.900
don't enjoy it that much, as

01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:05.900
is style. Yeah, and as far

01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:07.900
I'm sorry to say this, but

01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:09.900
his voice gets real whiny.

01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:11.900
In the higher pitches,

01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:13.900
he cracks, his voice gets real whiny, and

01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:15.900
so his...

01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:17.900
YOU STOLE IT! AND YOU DID IT!

01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:19.900
It just doesn't sell it to me.

01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:21.900
I try not to be too critical

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:23.900
on those kinds of fronts because I

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:25.900
think that most... Says the man with the golden voice.

01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:27.900
Yeah, but I also have,

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:29.900
you know, there are

01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:31.900
types of emoting

01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:33.900
that I can do where my voice is very annoying

01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:35.900
to folks as well.

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:37.900
I think that a lot of people don't have... I call that

01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:39.900
talking for me. People don't have

01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:41.900
as much control over

01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:43.900
the tonal qualities

01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:45.900
of their voice as they want to

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:47.900
without a lot of work going into it,

01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:49.900
so I always try and be

01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:51.900
understanding on that front.

01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:53.900
I mean just more in terms of the

01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:55.900
things that are very easily controllable.

01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:57.900
Right. You would think after four

01:31:57.900 --> 01:31:59.900
years you'd get a little bit better at

01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:01.900
faking an emotion if your job is

01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:03.900
basically to create

01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:05.900
and present emotions.

01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:07.900
Yeah, I mean if your job though, as you

01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:09.900
see it, is really just to do an Alex impression,

01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:11.900
you know. That's the problem.

01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:13.900
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So

01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:15.900
in this next clip, Owen writes some

01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:17.900
fan fiction about Trump

01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:19.900
and what he's up to while he's hiding.

01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:21.900
Sure. And just listen to this clip

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:23.900
and ask yourself, how is this

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:25.900
any different than what people online

01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:27.900
do with Q&A? Okay.

01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:29.900
But you know what? I think what

01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:31.900
President Trump is doing right now is he's giving

01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:33.900
these people one last chance.

01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:35.900
What? And he may have even given

01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:37.900
them a day and just said, you know what?

01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:43.900
I'm gonna go away. I'm gonna be quiet

01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:45.900
for about

01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:47.900
30 days.

01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:49.900
And you guys can concede this election

01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:51.900
and

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:53.900
you can stop lying to the American

01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:55.900
people

01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:57.900
and you can stop making

01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:59.900
deals with the Communist Chinese and stop

01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:01.900
working for the UN and the World Health Organization

01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:03.900
and

01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:05.900
let me be President.

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:07.900
Or you can

01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:09.900
continue to tick off the Americans.

01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:11.900
You can continue to tick

01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:13.900
off the Republic

01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:15.900
and I'll

01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:17.900
unleash this beast. I'll unleash

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:19.900
this kraken. I'll let this line roar

01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:21.900
and you can deal with that

01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:23.900
instead.

01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:25.900
Because that's where this is

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.900
going.

01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:29.900
Yeah, it's a million

01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:31.900
marchers in D.C. peacefully

01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:33.900
now. Yeah, it's gonna

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:35.900
be thousands of people peacefully in Atlanta

01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:37.900
this weekend. But let me tell you,

01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:39.900
if you steal this election from us

01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:41.900
and you put in a UN

01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:43.900
Communist

01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:45.900
corrupt criminal Joe Biden in the White

01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:47.900
House, it's not gonna be a million peaceful

01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:49.900
marchers in D.C. No,

01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:51.900
no, no. Okay.

01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:53.900
Okay, so if Biden is

01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:55.900
inaugurated, we will kill. Yeah,

01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:57.900
I mean, more or less. Good work, guys.

01:33:57.900 --> 01:33:59.900
Thanks for your help. He's creating this

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.900
fictitious imaginary scenario

01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:03.900
where Trump has given a deadline

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.900
for the globalists

01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:07.900
to back down and stop pissing

01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:09.900
off the patriots. And it's gonna be at high

01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:11.900
noon 30 days from now.

01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:13.900
Because he's such a good guy.

01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.900
You have to give him that chance

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:17.900
to do the right thing.

01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:19.900
And now this is where this idea

01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:21.900
that Owen is just creating out of

01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:23.900
his own fantasy. Isn't that the same thing the

01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:25.900
globalists have to do?

01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:27.900
Hey, interesting thought.

01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:29.900
That is an interesting thought. Because that dovetails

01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:31.900
in this next clip. Okay, here we go.

01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:33.900
Yeah. Trump's giving him one

01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:35.900
last shot. And of course

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:37.900
they're not gonna stop.

01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:39.900
But see, just like they have to have that

01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:41.900
metaphysical comfort,

01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:43.900
just like they have to have that metaphysical

01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:45.900
comfort of you accepting

01:34:45.900 --> 01:34:47.900
the mask, you accepting the vaccine,

01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:49.900
you accepting

01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:51.900
the tyranny, you inviting the tyranny,

01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:53.900
that gives them the metaphysical comfort knowing

01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:55.900
they didn't force it on you. You accepted it.

01:34:57.900 --> 01:34:59.900
Trump, we have to have

01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:01.900
the same metaphysical comfort knowing that we

01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:03.900
gave them the last shot too. Why?

01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:05.900
Hey, we gave you one last chance

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.900
to stop it, stop

01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:09.900
with the enslavement of mankind,

01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:11.900
stop with the lies

01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:13.900
that you're telling mankind,

01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:15.900
stop all of it, stop the election theft,

01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:17.900
you can stop it all right now. The censorship,

01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:19.900
you're coming after all of us. And they won't

01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:21.900
do it. But they've been given the metaphysical

01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:23.900
opportunity now.

01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:25.900
So there will be no

01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:27.900
excuses. Okay, this is a problem for

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:29.900
me on a couple levels. Oh, there's a problem

01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:31.900
on a lot of levels. The first is that

01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:33.900
this is just a preemptive justification for

01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:35.900
murder. Yep. Owen is telling the audience

01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:37.900
that once Biden is president, that means

01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:39.900
the audience's enemies have turned down

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:41.900
this imaginary last chance that Trump

01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:43.900
is offering them to give up their wicked ways.

01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:45.900
It's going to be tough to eat your neighbor

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:47.900
but take comfort in the fact that they deserve it

01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:49.900
because Trump gave them the last chance. They had a chance.

01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:51.900
They could have changed their mind at any point in

01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:53.900
time. They've earned it. That's the function of this.

01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:55.900
Yep. The second issue I have is with

01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:57.900
Owen's understanding of Alex's bizarre

01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.900
moral system. Owen seems

01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:01.900
to think that it's about the globalists needing to feel

01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:03.900
comfortable that they give you a choice, but

01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:05.900
that's not what Alex believes.

01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:07.900
Alex believes there are literal cosmic

01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:09.900
laws that even the devil cannot break

01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:11.900
that involve you not being able to act

01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:13.900
counter to someone else's free will.

01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:15.900
It's not that it's a comfort to know you

01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:17.900
didn't force people to do something, it's a belief

01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:19.900
system that involves instant karma coming

01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:21.900
if you do. It's a necessity.

01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:23.900
I worry that Alex

01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:25.900
may not have fully explained this whole

01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:27.900
system of how the cosmos worked to Owen,

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:29.900
which is troubling.

01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:31.900
I get the sense that maybe what happened is that

01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:33.900
Alex got pretty drunk a couple times and rambled

01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:35.900
at Owen about this. He misremembered

01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:37.900
some of it. This is all Owen remembers, yeah.

01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:39.900
It's about comfort, not

01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:41.900
the immutable laws of the universe.

01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:43.900
Even in, why,

01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:45.900
why, why are you

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:47.900
saying that you have to do

01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:49.900
the same thing as the globalists?

01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:51.900
Shouldn't you be like, we don't have

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:53.900
to do the globalists because we're not globalists?

01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:55.900
If you're saying we have to do the same thing as the globalists,

01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.900
that makes me think that you're actually globalists.

01:36:57.900 --> 01:36:59.900
It's not the same thing, it just has sort of

01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:01.900
similarities.

01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:03.900
With the

01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:05.900
globalists, they're

01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:07.900
like, they have to

01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:09.900
trick you into doing something. Sure, of course.

01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:11.900
That's deceitful. With Trump,

01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:13.900
this is straight up. How?

01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:15.900
Because this is him being like, hey,

01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:17.900
everybody knows everything, this is your last

01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:19.900
chance. No, he would be straight up if he

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:21.900
said that, but instead he's doing these weird

01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:23.900
esoteric legal challenges that don't

01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:25.900
make any sense. He's saying it to the globalists

01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:27.900
behind the scenes. Oh, okay.

01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:29.900
According to Owen's imagination.

01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:31.900
So then why do I have to die?

01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:33.900
Well, you had

01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:35.900
your chance. Okay, that's a good point.

01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:37.900
I did have my chance.

01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:39.900
You heard Owen imagine this

01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:41.900
thing, and you refused to get it on.

01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:43.900
Yeah, I had my

01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:45.900
obsolete acquiescence, I guess.

01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:47.900
Yeah, and I think that this also

01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:49.900
highlights the other thing where Owen is doing a

01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:51.900
bad Alex impression. Totally.

01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:53.900
His version of Alex's stupid moral

01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:55.900
system isn't interesting. It's even

01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:57.900
more stupid and less interesting.

01:37:57.900 --> 01:37:59.900
It's not interesting, whereas Alex seems like

01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:01.900
it's based on some kind of

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:03.900
real fucked up

01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:05.900
belief system that

01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:07.900
I'm interested in unraveling. I'm not

01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:09.900
interested in listening to Owen

01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:11.900
miscommunicate it. Well, he clearly doesn't

01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:13.900
share that nonsensical

01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:15.900
belief. Of course not. He doesn't share it,

01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:17.900
and I don't think he actually understands

01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:19.900
what Alex is trying to convey,

01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:21.900
and so he just sort of botches it.

01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:23.900
But he is doing an Alex impression,

01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:25.900
and apparently this is some piece of this

01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:27.900
mythology that's important enough that

01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:29.900
he feels like he needs to also include

01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:31.900
it. Jesus. And it's just

01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:33.900
blah. Yeah. So anyway, I was

01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:35.900
about ready to say fuck all this,

01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:37.900
but Owen, every time

01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:39.900
I think I'm out, he pulls me back in.

01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:41.900
Alright. Coming up in the

01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:43.900
next segment,

01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:45.900
we're going to be joined by Alex Jones and

01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:47.900
by Nick

01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:49.900
Fuentes, and apparently

01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:51.900
Alex has a big announcement that he

01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:53.900
is going to be making,

01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:55.900
and he really wants me to emphasize that.

01:38:55.900 --> 01:38:57.900
So Alex is coming up, huge

01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:59.900
announcement next segment.

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.900
I am not positive there is a huge

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:03.900
announcement, but when I hear that,

01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:05.900
you gotta stick around. Well, hello.

01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:07.900
That would be cool if he was going to

01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:09.900
sacrifice Nick Fuentes to Trump

01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:11.900
and eat his heart in

01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:13.900
public. Alex has shown

01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:15.900
inclinations towards cannibalism.

01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:17.900
I think that would work. I think I would definitely

01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:19.900
give Trump the presidency if Alex

01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:21.900
eviscerated Nick Fuentes and ate

01:39:21.900 --> 01:39:23.900
his heart live on air. The only

01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:25.900
thing that I think is kind of close to

01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:27.900
like maybe this is his huge announcement,

01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:29.900
because it's something I don't know if I've heard

01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:31.900
from him before,

01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:33.900
was he does say that

01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:35.900
the Austro-Hungarian empire did

01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:37.900
nothing wrong in the lead up to World War

01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:39.900
I. Okay, that's an issue for

01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:41.900
me. Somehow that's a new problem

01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:43.900
that I didn't know I had to converse with

01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:45.900
today. Well, I didn't, well we don't have to.

01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:47.900
Okay, good. Because I don't think that's his announcement.

01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:49.900
He does say that, and I got confused.

01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:51.900
We

01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:53.900
can talk about that another time if he brings

01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:55.900
it up again. I would like to hear more. It could have been

01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:57.900
a stray thought. He doesn't

01:39:57.900 --> 01:39:59.900
elaborate on it. He

01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:01.900
says it's all the British fault, their fault.

01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:03.900
Sure, sure, that sounds right.

01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:05.900
Anyway, that's not his announcement,

01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:07.900
but it could have been.

01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:09.900
Maybe it's that Nick Fuentes had the

01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:11.900
speech of the day. Best speech out

01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:13.900
there in Atlanta. And

01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:15.900
like I said. Did he just hiss for 25

01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:17.900
minutes? May as well have, but he hissed

01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:19.900
in the right direction. And that is

01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:21.900
at the GOP who aren't backing

01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:23.900
up Trump. Again, Nick is

01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:25.900
a guy who has a project.

01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:27.900
And his project now seems to be focused

01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:29.900
on being anti-GOP.

01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:31.900
He's a usurper.

01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:33.900
Mitch McConnell has said nothing. Nicky

01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:35.900
Haley has said nothing. Dan Crenshaw,

01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:37.900
Madison Cawthorne, all the people

01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:39.900
hailed as the future of the GOP have

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:41.900
remained silent while people like

01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:43.900
myself and Alex and patriots

01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:45.900
like you coming out to the state capitals

01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:47.900
have been doing all the work and fighting

01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:49.900
for this. So we have to take the fight

01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:51.900
to them no matter what happens with President Trump.

01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:53.900
And let's

01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:55.900
be clear. We know China

01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:57.900
Joe's a bought and paid for

01:40:57.900 --> 01:40:59.900
enemy. He's not even a traitor. He's just a robot.

01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:01.900
But when you've got

01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:03.900
Marco Rubio and

01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:05.900
you've got the gay pirate

01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:07.900
Crenshaw and all these

01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:09.900
fake people doing

01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:11.900
all of this, they are literally

01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:13.900
worse than the enemy because they act

01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:15.900
like they're with us when they're really

01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:17.900
establishment folks. Yeah, so

01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:19.900
it seems like this is the direction

01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:21.900
that they will probably want

01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:23.900
to go next with

01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:25.900
their targets.

01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:27.900
Obviously you can always keep Soros

01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:29.900
and all that shit in the back burner.

01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:31.900
But yeah,

01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:33.900
ineffective, cowardly

01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:35.900
Republicans in name

01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:37.900
only can be the new enemy.

01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:39.900
The turncoats who didn't support

01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:41.900
Trump in his hour of need.

01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:43.900
Guys, I agree with you. They were lying

01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:45.900
to you the whole time. But in a different way

01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:47.900
than what you think. They were lying

01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:49.900
differently than you. Like it would

01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:51.900
almost, I wonder, sometimes I wonder

01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:53.900
like what would happen if the Murdochs

01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:55.900
just like one day were like

01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:57.900
hey, we

01:41:57.900 --> 01:41:59.900
don't want everybody to be

01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:01.900
killed. So we're just gonna announce

01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:03.900
Fox News has been lying

01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:05.900
to you this whole fucking time. It was

01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:07.900
our idea. We wanted to get you guys

01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:09.900
to do the bullshit that we wanted to.

01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:11.900
Now, we don't want you to kill

01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:13.900
everybody. Sorry. Someone would

01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:15.900
find some investor in

01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:17.900
News Corp and be like

01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:19.900
well this is why they said that cause he got

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:21.900
bought off but it would turn into a

01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:23.900
conspiracy of its own. It's never gonna change.

01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:25.900
So I think that

01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:27.900
Alex is really into this too

01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:29.900
and I think it's probably

01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:31.900
a really sound decision on his part

01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:33.900
in terms of where to take the rhetoric.

01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:35.900
Where to take the

01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:37.900
narratives. If you want to try and shift

01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:39.900
into some direction

01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:41.900
going against the

01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:43.900
ineffective

01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:45.900
turncoat Republicans or whatever

01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:47.900
is probably gonna be your best bet.

01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:49.900
Because then you'll probably get

01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:51.900
a little bit of the slack of

01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:53.900
people on the left caring about

01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:55.900
what you're doing. If you're attacking

01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:57.900
the people they don't like

01:42:57.900 --> 01:42:59.900
less mean comments on Twitter

01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:01.900
are going to come in.

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:03.900
And you saw exactly

01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:05.900
this model play out with

01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:07.900
Nick Fuentes when he started attacking

01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:09.900
Turning Point there was a lot

01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:11.900
of people who were like let em fight

01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:13.900
or there were a lot of people who were like

01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:15.900
haha look at this isn't this funny?

01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:17.900
And in the process they

01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.900
passively or by

01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:21.900
amplifying and laughing

01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:23.900
at them making fun of

01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:25.900
Charlie Kirk aided

01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:27.900
in pushing and furthering

01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:29.900
Nick Fuentes' goals. So I

01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:31.900
think that this is probably if

01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:33.900
you're just trying to craft like

01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:35.900
what do we do next now that we know

01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:37.900
there's no chance this is gonna

01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:39.900
work out it's probably a sound thing to do.

01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:41.900
Well I mean I'm gonna

01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:43.900
I would say going back to their

01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:45.900
terrible military strategy and then

01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:47.900
update it for us here

01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:49.900
when your enemies are

01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:51.900
infighting it is a bad idea to

01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:53.900
just let them watch or to just

01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:55.900
watch it. That's when they're weakest. That's when

01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:57.900
you destroy both of them. You can't

01:43:57.900 --> 01:43:59.900
allow them to regroup

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:01.900
after defeating their inner

01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:03.900
struggle in order to become even worse.

01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:05.900
And the worst parts of

01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:07.900
it probably entrenched during

01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:09.900
that infighting. Then we saw

01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:11.900
that in 2009 onward

01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:13.900
with the Tea Party we are

01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:15.900
going to probably see that

01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:17.900
again unless and I don't know

01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:19.900
what you do like I don't you know I don't

01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:21.900
like to talk about crushing

01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:23.900
because I think that that's kind of

01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:25.900
I don't know violent imagery

01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:27.900
and I'm not super into that.

01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:29.900
I don't know what you do to push back against this

01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:31.900
stuff but I do agree with you like

01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:33.900
watching and laughing like haha they're

01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:35.900
destroying each other is not

01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:37.900
good when one of the parties that

01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:39.900
is doing the destroying is

01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:41.900
far more extreme than

01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:43.900
and that's not to say hey we should defend

01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:45.900
the mainline GOP. No.

01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:47.900
It's just that neither of those is a winning

01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:49.900
strategy. No I mean what we should do

01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:51.900
is what the right has always done

01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:53.900
successfully to the left and the center

01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:55.900
which is exacerbate

01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:57.900
whatever differences they have and force

01:44:57.900 --> 01:44:59.900
them to destroy each other instead of just

01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:01.900
the right never sits back and watches

01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:03.900
us fight.

01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:05.900
Fair enough.

01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:07.900
But anyway Alex says he's going to take over

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:09.900
the GOP which is what he said

01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:11.900
years ago and then he said he had and then

01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:13.900
Trump did and now I guess they're

01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:15.900
doing it again but

01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:17.900
this is so lucky.

01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:19.900
Nick starts talking about

01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:21.900
his view of America. Oh no.

01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:23.900
And the mic cuts out at

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.900
exactly the right time. Yeah I would imagine

01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:27.900
so. You know who the rhinos are and we're

01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:29.900
taking over the party. We are the people

01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:31.900
we are the populist movement. How would you describe

01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:33.900
the new right

01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:35.900
or just the new populist?

01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:37.900
Nazis. Well I call it America first

01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:39.900
because what distinguishes us

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:41.900
from them is our interpretation

01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:43.900
of what is America. In our view

01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:45.900
what constitutes America is the American

01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:47.900
people. It's not America

01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:49.900
as its economy. It's not America

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:51.900
as its government. It's not America.

01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:55.900
It's not America.

01:45:55.900 --> 01:45:57.900
Alright we are

01:45:57.900 --> 01:45:59.900
live right now.

01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:01.900
We have Alex Jones and Nick Fuentes

01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:03.900
our

01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:05.900
transmission there. Our connection has been

01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:07.900
interrupted. We will get them potted up.

01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:09.900
If I were a producer and I were watching

01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:11.900
this and I knew who Nick Fuentes was

01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:13.900
exactly. I'm not saying that's what happened.

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:15.900
Red button! Red button as soon as he can!

01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:17.900
He's about to say it's not America the republic!

01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:19.900
Stop it! Red button! He's about to say it's not

01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:21.900
America the country! If he's left

01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:23.900
to talk about what he believes the

01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:25.900
American people are

01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:27.900
it's going to become

01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:29.900
a little blunt what his beliefs

01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:31.900
are. I'm not saying that someone

01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:33.900
did hit the red button or anything. There's

01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:35.900
equally possible that their tech issues

01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:37.900
just suck so much. More possible. But if

01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:39.900
I were there I would have done exactly that.

01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:41.900
Totally. Because you can't risk

01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:43.900
like that

01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:45.900
game getting blown up.

01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.900
You're just waiting for them to be like

01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:49.900
and we're going to round up

01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:51.900
all the people with mental health issues

01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:53.900
and put them in the...

01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:55.900
Who hit the red button?

01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:57.900
Exactly. All immigrants have to go

01:46:57.900 --> 01:46:59.900
and okay.

01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:01.900
Well. Yep. Yep. Anyway

01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:03.900
I thought that maybe that

01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:05.900
trucker strike thing that Nick was talking about

01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:07.900
was just trying to rile up the crowd.

01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:09.900
It turns out he really

01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:11.900
is in support of this. Which is weird.

01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:13.900
That is weird. But then it's weirder

01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:15.900
that Alex is too. Okay. Fuck off.

01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:17.900
And I'll tell you I really like what I'm seeing

01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:19.900
with this trucker strike that they're planning

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:21.900
later this month. I was about to say I've been meaning to

01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:23.900
promote that for a week.

01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:25.900
If the trucker strike, especially on the east coast

01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:27.900
is shut down. They should shut down blue states

01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:29.900
and blue cities. Hey you're shutting us down with the COVID

01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:31.900
hugs. We're shutting you down. And they

01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:33.900
should come to Georgia and other state capitals and

01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:35.900
just drive around honking the whole

01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:37.900
time. In fact truckers I'm calling for you

01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:39.900
on Thursday, Friday and Saturday here

01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:41.900
at noon every day. Drive around

01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:43.900
the

01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:45.900
the capital honking your

01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:47.900
horns. Honk for us.

01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:49.900
Nick is a child so I'm less interested

01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:51.900
in his political philosophy making coherent sense.

01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:53.900
Sure. Alex on the other hand should

01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:55.900
definitely not be in favor of a strike

01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:57.900
just because he likes the goal of it.

01:47:57.900 --> 01:47:59.900
The means that's being used to achieve

01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:01.900
the goal is the withholding of labor in an

01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:03.900
organized fashion, which he totally

01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:05.900
hates. It's interesting and kind

01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:07.900
of ironic why this plan that Nick

01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:09.900
is so keen on would never work.

01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:11.900
The biggest reason is deregulation

01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:13.900
and union busting in the shipping and trucking

01:48:13.900 --> 01:48:15.900
sector. According to Snopes there

01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:17.900
used to be two million truckers who were

01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:19.900
members of the Teamsters and now there are

01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:21.900
only 75,000. Great.

01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:23.900
The institutional power that truckers had in the

01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:25.900
70s from banding together and keeping

01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:27.900
those unions strong has disappeared, largely

01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:29.900
due to political influence of

01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:31.900
people who Nick and Alex would be largely

01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:33.900
in agreement with, at least as far as labor

01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:35.900
issues go. God. There is

01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:37.900
often big talk about

01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:39.900
truckers striking because it brings to mind

01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:41.900
a complete shutdown of food distribution

01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:43.900
and the myriad issues that come along with it,

01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:45.900
but the sad reality is that these

01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:47.900
strikes don't really end up having any

01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:49.900
real impact because they can't.

01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:51.900
If you're a trucker and you want a strike

01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:53.900
are you going to get the Teamsters to strike

01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:55.900
to install Trump as president?

01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:57.900
Do you really think that's going to work?

01:48:57.900 --> 01:48:59.900
That's probably never going to happen

01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:01.900
so if you're working in a union shop

01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:03.900
that's not going to be a strike, that's going to

01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:05.900
be you quitting. If you're an

01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:07.900
independent trucker or maybe you work for a

01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:09.900
smaller outfit that's theoretically on board

01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:11.900
with this strike, you probably can't afford

01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:13.900
to do it because there's no protection for

01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:15.900
you. You have no weight to throw

01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:17.900
around by withholding your labor since

01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:19.900
whoever's hiring you can just hire somebody

01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:21.900
else. If those tomatoes need to

01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:23.900
get to Kansas and you're on strike to install

01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:25.900
your fantasy king, great, good for

01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:27.900
you, you're fired, and this other truck

01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:29.900
is going to get paid to haul those tomatoes.

01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:31.900
The only way this kind of

01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:33.900
strategy could work is ironically

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:35.900
if the world was exactly how Alex

01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:37.900
and Nick don't want it to be.

01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:39.900
If the trucker's union was strong and

01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:41.900
everyone in it could vote to stop work because

01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:43.900
they felt the election was stolen, it would be

01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:45.900
super fucked up but they could make a pretty huge

01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:47.900
statement. The political movement

01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:49.900
that Alex and Nick are a part of has actually

01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:51.900
ensured that this can never

01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:53.900
really happen. It is because

01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:55.900
it's clearly them being like, well we would

01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:57.900
love unions if they agreed with us

01:49:57.900 --> 01:49:59.900
and for some reason we can't get unions

01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:01.900
to agree that we should destroy unions

01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:03.900
and I just don't get it!

01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:05.900
Honestly, even if this could

01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:07.900
possibly happen, this idea,

01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:09.900
it doesn't matter. On this

01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:11.900
day, when this episode is recorded, November

01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:13.900
18th, the guy who organized this

01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:15.900
strike called it off.

01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:17.900
Probably because it was an absurd idea

01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:19.900
that would only hurt the participants and achieve

01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:21.900
literally nothing. Well there is that.

01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:23.900
Yeah, I'm fascinated by

01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:25.900
this abdication of their

01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:27.900
political beliefs though.

01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:29.900
I don't understand it. Their political

01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:31.900
beliefs are we will do anything

01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:33.900
to get what we want. So

01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:35.900
that's why it always gets to me

01:50:35.900 --> 01:50:37.900
whenever somebody's like, oh Mitch McConnell's

01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:39.900
a hypocrite or any of that bullshit.

01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:41.900
Their only political belief

01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:43.900
is here is the thing that I want

01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:45.900
and I will do anything to get it.

01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:47.900
So there's no possible way for them to

01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:49.900
be hypocritical in this fashion.

01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:51.900
You know? That's their belief system.

01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:53.900
I understand that with

01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:55.900
people like Mitch McConnell.

01:50:55.900 --> 01:50:57.900
I know that Alex

01:50:57.900 --> 01:50:59.900
isn't any better but his brand is supposed

01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:01.900
to be that he's better. His brand is

01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:03.900
supposed to be, yeah, exactly.

01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:05.900
I understand. And that's why it's just

01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:07.900
kind of weird to me that like

01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:09.900
I get it

01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:11.900
but I don't get how you

01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:13.900
don't get it. Not you.

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.900
No no no, I know. I know.

01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:17.900
Anyway, Alex's traffic is way up because

01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:19.900
of course it is. Because of course it is. During these sorts of periods

01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:21.900
Alex ends up getting much more

01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:23.900
traffic I think a lot of the times because people

01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:25.900
want to see him drunk and crying or something.

01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:27.900
There's a lot of potential

01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:29.900
for something. And he said

01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:31.900
this a couple times in the last couple

01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:33.900
weeks. That traffic is way

01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:35.900
up and no one's buying anything.

01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:37.900
And that's sort of characteristic of either

01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:39.900
artificial traffic or people

01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:41.900
tuning in to be like, oh

01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:43.900
something bad is going to happen. Yeah, we saw that

01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:45.900
multiple times. Multiple times.

01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:47.900
He's like, traffic is so, it's

01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:49.900
triple the size but people aren't buying anything

01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:51.900
and I just don't, yeah.

01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:53.900
We are seeing four or five times the traffic

01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:55.900
on the side. It's pissing off the

01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:57.900
public. They don't know what to do. They've got

01:51:57.900 --> 01:51:59.900
feds, FBI that come in the restaurant

01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:01.900
sit down every morning we eat breakfast.

01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:03.900
They put CIA stickers on our car

01:52:03.900 --> 01:52:05.900
even in locked up garages. And they

01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:07.900
just want us to know they're watching. Of course we know

01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:09.900
that you're helping guide in the

01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:11.900
end of America and the merger with the New World Order

01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:13.900
because it's going to be peaceful and good.

01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:15.900
But it's not. They're coming to sterilize our sons.

01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:17.900
They're coming with 5G. They're coming to fry us and kill us.

01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:19.900
That's their own damn admissions. They're going to depopulate

01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:21.900
us. And so all you FBI agents remember

01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:23.900
you're going to be thrown

01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:25.900
to the wind just like all these

01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:27.900
tyrants do. You're destroying America.

01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:29.900
You're destroying everything. So I feel good

01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:31.900
about what I'm doing and I'm not threatened and I'm not intimidated.

01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:33.900
So I have a hundred feds follow us if you want.

01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:35.900
You work for the shy comms and if you don't stand

01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:37.900
with us you have that on your conscience. You have

01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:39.900
God to face and God's real and God's

01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:41.900
the real judge. We'll be right back. Wow.

01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:43.900
Whoa boy. That's something.

01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:45.900
That's intense. Yeah.

01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:47.900
That's a bit. Alex's traffic is way

01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:49.900
up and the feds are

01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:51.900
following him and putting CIA stickers

01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:53.900
on his car. I wrote that down. I'm confused

01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:55.900
as to why they would do that.

01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:57.900
Is that just a

01:52:57.900 --> 01:52:59.900
gentle reminder? Hey guys.

01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:01.900
We're watching. Just to let you know.

01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:03.900
We can put a sticker on your car anytime

01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:05.900
we want. Yeah.

01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:07.900
I don't know if

01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:09.900
the CIA isn't a prank. Do you think

01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:11.900
it might be a bunch of kids?

01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:13.900
It certainly could be. I mean I think

01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:15.900
that or it could be people who used to

01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:17.900
like Alex and now have decided he's a shill

01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:19.900
or something. Could be. Or like you're in the CIA

01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:21.900
we're going to label your car. Yeah.

01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:23.900
I mean or it didn't happen at all in

01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:25.900
Alex's imagination. Oh that's a possibility.

01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:27.900
He's just making all this up. He's just making up a bunch

01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:29.900
of bullshit. Yeah. Any of these things are possible

01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:31.900
but what I think is not possible

01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:33.900
is that the feds are following him

01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:35.900
around Atlanta and putting CIA buttons

01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:37.900
on his stickers on his car. Would you say that it's not possible

01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:39.900
for the FBI to

01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:41.900
be going around and putting CIA

01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:43.900
stickers on Alex's stuff? I find it

01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:45.900
implausible. Where would they even get those stickers?

01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:47.900
I don't know if they exist. Exactly. So

01:53:47.900 --> 01:53:49.900
Alex gets in this next clip to what I

01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:51.900
think might be possibly his

01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:53.900
big news but it just makes no sense that

01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:55.900
this would be the big news.

01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:57.900
We're here. I've got big news as I said.

01:53:57.900 --> 01:53:59.900
The Austro-Hungarian empire. I want to start

01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:01.900
getting into it now. The freedom

01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:03.900
streak of those of us that were pro-Trump

01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:05.900
pro-America. We don't

01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:07.900
go away just if they steal this election from Trump.

01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:09.900
And it's the fighting

01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:11.900
the fraudulent election

01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:13.900
that puts us in position to absolutely

01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:15.900
now if you thought Trump put a

01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:17.900
big dent in the New World Order.

01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:19.900
We're just getting started. Trump is just one way.

01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:21.900
So I guess his big

01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:23.900
news is that

01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:25.900
Trump isn't the end. Which is not

01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:27.900
news. That doesn't sound like news at all.

01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:29.900
It's not big. Especially considering

01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:31.900
he said it in 2016 before Trump won

01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:33.900
the election. He was like, listen, here's the major

01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:35.900
victory for us. Trump isn't

01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:37.900
the end of things. Yeah, this is just

01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:39.900
a step along the way. Exactly.

01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:41.900
I don't know. If there was some

01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:43.900
sort of actual big news, it's not

01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:45.900
gotten to at all.

01:54:45.900 --> 01:54:47.900
It's just that we keep on fighting

01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:49.900
and what have you. Sure, sure, sure.

01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:51.900
And then Nick phrases this in such a

01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:53.900
weird way. But it's actually not that weird.

01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:55.900
It's really revealing.

01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:57.900
What they've done is they've disenfranchised

01:54:57.900 --> 01:54:59.900
73 million Trump supporters.

01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:01.900
The president gained

01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:03.900
10 million voters between 2016

01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:05.900
and 2020. There's more Trump supporters

01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:07.900
than ever. There's more patriots than ever

01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:09.900
that are aware of globalism. The idea

01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:11.900
that stealing the election from us

01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:13.900
and canceling our votes and disenfranchising

01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:15.900
70-some million people

01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:17.900
that we go away after all

01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:19.900
of that, if they just get through,

01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:21.900
you know, they speed through the process, they

01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:23.900
see Joe Biden, do they think then that

01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:25.900
we just disappear into thin air?

01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:27.900
Losing an election is not the same thing

01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:29.900
as being disenfranchised. But this

01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:31.900
is actually a really neat moment of clarity

01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:33.900
for Nick, because it is the

01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:35.900
same thing to him. He believes that

01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:37.900
he's entitled to win everything, whether it

01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:39.900
be due to the color of his skin or his

01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:41.900
radical Catholicism. This is

01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:43.900
the same mentality you hear

01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:45.900
in that tape of Richard Spencer that Milo

01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:47.900
released. In his rant,

01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:49.900
Spencer said, quote,

01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:51.900
like, this is never over. I win. They fucking

01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:53.900
lose. That's how the world fucking works.

01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:55.900
Little fucking Ks.

01:55:55.900 --> 01:55:57.900
They get ruled by people like me.

01:55:57.900 --> 01:55:59.900
My ancestors fucking enslaved

01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:01.900
those little pieces of fucking shit.

01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:03.900
I rule the fucking world. Those pieces

01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:05.900
of fucking shit get ruled over, ruled

01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:07.900
by people like me. They look up

01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:09.900
and see a face like mine looking down at

01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:11.900
them. This audio was allegedly

01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:13.900
recorded the day after the Unite

01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:15.900
the Right rally in 2017,

01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:17.900
which Nick Fuentes took part in.

01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:19.900
It's not hard to understand

01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:21.900
that underneath whatever slick presentation

01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:23.900
folks like Nick have, that rage of entitlement

01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:25.900
is just below the surface.

01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:27.900
It makes total sense for him to claim that

01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:29.900
losing an election is disenfranchising

01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:31.900
his side because he's entitled to

01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:33.900
win. Would he ever think that

01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:35.900
all the people who voted for Hillary in 2016

01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:37.900
were disenfranchised? No, of course not.

01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:39.900
Because they're entitled to lose

01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:41.900
to someone like him. They're globalists

01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:43.900
and they're evil and they should be

01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:45.900
Yeah, it's very, it's very

01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:47.900
fucked up. It's exactly what they

01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:49.900
Yeah, they want a, well, I mean, if you want

01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:51.900
a homogenous nation, then the idea

01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:53.900
that losing

01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:55.900
an election is possible is kind of silly.

01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:57.900
True. And

01:56:57.900 --> 01:56:59.900
I mean, like,

01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:01.900
he's not going to be pressed on this on Infowars

01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:03.900
because Alex doesn't want to open up this

01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:05.900
box of worms, but

01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:07.900
I mean, he believes that people who have, like,

01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:09.900
immigrated here shouldn't

01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:11.900
vote and stuff. Nick, Nick, I have

01:57:11.900 --> 01:57:13.900
a couple of quick questions for you.

01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:15.900
Do you want a white nation?

01:57:15.900 --> 01:57:17.900
Wow! Okay,

01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:19.900
follow-up question. Have you ever

01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:21.900
heard of what happens to people who don't have

01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:23.900
quote, pure blood in a white

01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:25.900
nation? I've heard, I've- Nick Fuentes.

01:57:25.900 --> 01:57:27.900
Yes, I've heard. Have you heard

01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:29.900
what happens to people who

01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:31.900
do not have pure blood?

01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:33.900
That's a point that comes up

01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:35.900
in a number of discussions that he's had

01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:37.900
that I've seen. The point

01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:39.900
about his last name being Fuentes.

01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:41.900
Um, and

01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:43.900
I don't know, I don't know, I don't think

01:57:43.900 --> 01:57:45.900
he really deals with that. I don't think he wants to.

01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:47.900
No. No. Anyway,

01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:49.900
I think it's interesting

01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:51.900
that, you know,

01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:53.900
this is all very revealing.

01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:55.900
This, the conversation

01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:57.900
that they're having, whether it be

01:57:57.900 --> 01:57:59.900
Owen being like, yeah,

01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:01.900
mob violence, they deserve it.

01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:03.900
Yep, hey, they have it coming. Okay.

01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:05.900
Trump gave them an ephemeral

01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:07.900
chance that they had no idea was happening

01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:09.900
because he put it in a court

01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:11.900
filing where he said

01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:13.900
that demons were flying in

01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:15.900
from Stargates to shit on our shoes.

01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:17.900
Pretty blunt. All

01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:19.900
of their specific points that they're making

01:58:19.900 --> 01:58:21.900
about these, the various

01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:23.900
states are nonsensical.

01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:25.900
You know, Nick is just

01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:27.900
talking about taking over the

01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:29.900
GOP. I think he's probably

01:58:29.900 --> 01:58:31.900
is the most singular focus. Yeah.

01:58:31.900 --> 01:58:33.900
And I don't know if he actually believes

01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:35.900
this or he knows that Alex believes

01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:37.900
it and therefore it's best to

01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:39.900
play into Alex's beliefs.

01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:41.900
But he's presenting himself as also

01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:43.900
fighting the literal devil. Sure.

01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:45.900
We're fighting a spiritual war.

01:58:45.900 --> 01:58:47.900
You know, don't forget, it's not about on some level

01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:49.900
even Republicans and Democrats or

01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:51.900
globalists and people, although it is

01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:53.900
in some sense, it is about the

01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:55.900
rulers and the principalities

01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:57.900
of other realms, evil

01:58:57.900 --> 01:58:59.900
versus good. That's what it's always been.

01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:01.900
Other realms, other dimensions. The Bible's right.

01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:03.900
Yeah. So I don't know if Nick

01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:05.900
actually believes that or if he's

01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:07.900
doing this to manipulate Alex. Sure.

01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:09.900
Either is possible. But also

01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:11.900
you see that Republicans or

01:59:11.900 --> 01:59:13.900
Democrats, globalists or

01:59:13.900 --> 01:59:15.900
people. Yep. That's the dichotomy

01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:17.900
there. That's strange.

01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:19.900
No, he's genuinely one

01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:21.900
of those truly terrifying psychopaths.

01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:23.900
You know? Yeah.

01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:25.900
Like, he's a guy who

01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:27.900
provides you, I would

01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:29.900
say that 99% of the people

01:59:29.900 --> 01:59:31.900
in the world you can actually

01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:33.900
talk to. They're reasonable people.

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.900
But guys like Nick Fuentes are

01:59:35.900 --> 01:59:37.900
that argument for like, you can't

01:59:37.900 --> 01:59:39.900
talk to this. He's a

01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:41.900
terrifying psychopath. Yeah, like a couple months ago.

01:59:41.900 --> 01:59:43.900
This can only be handled by a

01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:45.900
larger power, you know?

01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:47.900
Like a federal, or like a

01:59:47.900 --> 01:59:49.900
law, not God, obviously.

01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:51.900
Like a level of

01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:53.900
something, somebody needs to step in

01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:55.900
because this isn't a like

01:59:55.900 --> 01:59:57.900
one-on-one conversation that you can have with

01:59:57.900 --> 01:59:59.900
Nick Fuentes. If you or someone in his life

01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:01.900
you might want to try and like get him help.

02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:03.900
Yeah. I mean like a couple months ago he got

02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:05.900
he posted a video of him

02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:07.900
going to like troll a Black Lives Matter

02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:09.900
protest. Yeah. Where like

02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:11.900
he had one of his friends had a sign that said, I can't

02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:13.900
read. Yeah. Like parodying

02:00:13.900 --> 02:00:15.900
I can't breathe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's the type of

02:00:15.900 --> 02:00:17.900
person who does shit like that. Yeah. Like that's

02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:19.900
just like, take the political stuff

02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:21.900
out of it. Take the, take anything

02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:23.900
out of it. It's just

02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:25.900
antisocial

02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:27.900
disgusting behavior. Mm-hmm. And

02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:29.900
I don't know. Anyway

02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:31.900
I think that what we saw a little bit

02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:33.900
in that CPAC appearance is sort of

02:00:33.900 --> 02:00:35.900
continuing.

02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:37.900
It's not been as consistent

02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:39.900
or direct as it appeared

02:00:39.900 --> 02:00:41.900
it might be. Mm-hmm. Because it did appear that

02:00:41.900 --> 02:00:43.900
Nick Fuentes was kind of trying to

02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:45.900
like usurp.

02:00:45.900 --> 02:00:47.900
Say a little bit. A little bit. Yeah.

02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:49.900
And I think that he's taking up

02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:51.900
a mantle here as more of

02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:53.900
like actual leader

02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:55.900
than Alex. Yeah. And that's kind

02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:57.900
of scary but also like what are you going to

02:00:57.900 --> 02:00:59.900
lead? Alex's kingdom

02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:01.900
is illusory. Yeah. He doesn't really exist.

02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:03.900
Yeah. That's the thing that I

02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:05.900
was wondering. Like what do you want to be?

02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:07.900
The next Owen Troyer? Good luck. No. I mean

02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:09.900
we saw this on, his ambition is

02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:11.900
clearly far outside. Way higher. Yeah.

02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:13.900
Yeah. Way, way higher than being

02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:15.900
a second in command to Alex. Yeah.

02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:17.900
Which is kind of why. His project

02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:19.900
involves using Infowars.

02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:21.900
Exactly. Not being a part of it.

02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:23.900
As a stepping stone. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

02:01:23.900 --> 02:01:25.900
He probably is almost even embarrassed that they

02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:27.900
are the sort of people he has to use. He still has to.

02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:29.900
Yeah, yeah. As soon as he gets outside

02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:31.900
of their level he's not, he's not a

02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:33.900
ladder up guy. Mm-mm.

02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:35.900
Uh-uh. No.

02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:37.900
Owen who? What was the

02:01:37.900 --> 02:01:39.900
what was the name of the event

02:01:39.900 --> 02:01:41.900
that they went to? The RNC

02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:43.900
remember

02:01:43.900 --> 02:01:45.900
when Alex got super drunk and couldn't give a

02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:47.900
The deplorer ball? The deplorer ball when he couldn't even give his own

02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:49.900
keynote speech. Yeah. Yeah.

02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:51.900
Was that the one where? No, no, no. You're talking about

02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:53.900
CPAC. Yeah. The deplorer ball is where he got really

02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:55.900
drunk and peed on a tree. Yeah, that was a different one.

02:01:55.900 --> 02:01:57.900
Yeah. Oh, good

02:01:57.900 --> 02:01:59.900
time. Yeah. No, at

02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:01.900
CPAC whenever Fuentes showed

02:02:01.900 --> 02:02:03.900
up and clearly stole the show from him

02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:05.900
Mm-hmm. Like even then my first thought is

02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:07.900
like Alex, this is not

02:02:07.900 --> 02:02:09.900
somebody that you can use.

02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:11.900
This is somebody you should watch out

02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:13.900
for. Yeah. This is somebody who's gunning

02:02:13.900 --> 02:02:15.900
for you and if you can't see that

02:02:15.900 --> 02:02:17.900
you're insane to me. Mm-hmm. You know?

02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:19.900
Yeah, but Alex and him can

02:02:19.900 --> 02:02:21.900
coexist as long as he follows

02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:23.900
Nick. Sure. Yeah, like I agree.

02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:25.900
And if the next season

02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:27.900
and the next project is

02:02:27.900 --> 02:02:29.900
destroying the GOP who won't

02:02:29.900 --> 02:02:31.900
bend to their extremist

02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:33.900
tea party will, then

02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:35.900
the two of them could have common cause and coexist

02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:37.900
perfectly fine. Sure.

02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:39.900
It's just once

02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:41.900
Fuentes in his like larger project

02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:43.900
leaning towards Catholic fascism

02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:45.900
Mm-hmm. Yeah. It becomes

02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:47.900
more apparent. That's where him and Alex

02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:49.900
might come to loggerheads.

02:02:49.900 --> 02:02:51.900
Yeah. But that's a ways off.

02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:53.900
See, that's the thing though. If you're Alex, you

02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:55.900
have to see Nick Fuentes and

02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:57.900
realize two things. One,

02:02:57.900 --> 02:02:59.900
it's, he's

02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:01.900
never going to bend to you. No.

02:03:01.900 --> 02:03:03.900
That's never going to happen. Uh-uh. And two,

02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:05.900
there's only two ways that goes.

02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:07.900
Yep. You bend to him

02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:09.900
and he disappears. Uh-huh. Those are the

02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:11.900
only options there. And when he's gone,

02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:13.900
when he disappears, uh-huh, he's planning

02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:15.900
something against you. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:17.900
Yes. What don't you understand about who

02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:19.900
you, why don't any of these people know who

02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:21.900
their friends are? Yeah. Every,

02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:23.900
everybody who's run afoul

02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:25.900
of Roger Stone, Roger Stone has tried to

02:03:25.900 --> 02:03:27.900
destroy. Uh, yeah. You don't think he's

02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:29.900
going to do that again? Yeah. You don't, what do you think he's going to be like,

02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:31.900
well, I have some sentimental attachment to Alex.

02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:33.900
Yeah. Get the fuck out of here. He used to be friends

02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:35.900
with Larry Klayman.

02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:37.900
And we saw how that went. Exactly.

02:03:37.900 --> 02:03:39.900
Yeah. It's not, don't,

02:03:39.900 --> 02:03:41.900
don't, don't get involved.

02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:43.900
Ugh. So stupid. Yeah, and Nick

02:03:43.900 --> 02:03:45.900
Fuentes seems like, uh,

02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:47.900
I mean, like, just

02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:49.900
quite frankly, slick.

02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:51.900
Yeah. Intelligent. Mm-hmm.

02:03:51.900 --> 02:03:53.900
Uh, able to- Razor focused.

02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:55.900
Yes. Razor focused. To a level

02:03:55.900 --> 02:03:57.900
that you just don't see generally

02:03:57.900 --> 02:03:59.900
with people who are in the Info Wars here.

02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:01.900
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, like, obviously

02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:03.900
I agree with you. If I were Alex, I would be

02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:05.900
terrified of him. Yeah. And work

02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:07.900
to pretend- I would be trying to destroy him.

02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:09.900
I would, either that or pretend he doesn't exist.

02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:11.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah. One of the two. Totally.

02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:13.900
But Alex can't because

02:04:13.900 --> 02:04:15.900
Nick is fairly popular

02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:17.900
in these right-wing worlds, and he has

02:04:17.900 --> 02:04:19.900
uh, you know, whatever

02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:21.900
amount of juice that he does and

02:04:21.900 --> 02:04:23.900
groipers and stuff, and Alex wants a piece of it.

02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:25.900
Yeah. It's just so weird to be

02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:27.900
watching a Greek tragedy happen

02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:29.900
and not have that, like, if you're

02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:31.900
watching a play and you're watching a Greek tragedy

02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:33.900
you're like, man, those characters have no idea

02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:35.900
what's coming for them next. Well, see

02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:37.900
but here's where I would take issue with that.

02:04:37.900 --> 02:04:39.900
It's the same thing with me saying that, like,

02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:41.900
Alex should only be in studio and Owen should

02:04:41.900 --> 02:04:43.900
be his proxy. Sure. Like, that is what

02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:45.900
they should do, and that is a way that it could

02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:47.900
play out and it's gonna be disappointing when it doesn't.

02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:49.900
Right. You looking at this as a Greek tragedy

02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:51.900
is also probably not how it's gonna

02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:53.900
play out. It's probably true. It's probably way less

02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:55.900
interesting, uh, than it is.

02:04:55.900 --> 02:04:57.900
Yeah, that's probably true. Because people

02:04:57.900 --> 02:04:59.900
develop and people change over time

02:04:59.900 --> 02:05:01.900
and honestly, I think the most

02:05:01.900 --> 02:05:03.900
likely thing that's going to happen

02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:05.900
is that

02:05:05.900 --> 02:05:07.900
Alex and

02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:09.900
Nick will have some

02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:11.900
sort of an alliance and be able

02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:13.900
to work together, attacking the GOP.

02:05:13.900 --> 02:05:15.900
Yeah. And then, I don't

02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:17.900
know, Nick can't help himself.

02:05:17.900 --> 02:05:19.900
He's also a fucking extreme troll.

02:05:19.900 --> 02:05:21.900
He's a lunatic. He's gonna do something

02:05:21.900 --> 02:05:23.900
that ends up getting him kicked off

02:05:23.900 --> 02:05:25.900
whatever streaming platform he's been relegated

02:05:25.900 --> 02:05:27.900
to now, or whatever.

02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:29.900
Like, he can't not push the

02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:31.900
envelope. Yeah, that's true. And he'll

02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:33.900
just be some sort of an extremist

02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:35.900
voice. Uh,

02:05:35.900 --> 02:05:37.900
next George Lincoln Rockwell or

02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:39.900
some shit. Yeah, probably.

02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:41.900
I just, uh, he's just one of those

02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:43.900
guys who it seems like

02:05:43.900 --> 02:05:45.900
he's that, like, dark

02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:47.900
candidate in the GOP

02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:49.900
that they cannot see coming.

02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:51.900
You know? Like, they just don't see him

02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:53.900
coming. They think they're completely

02:05:53.900 --> 02:05:55.900
different people, and then Nick

02:05:55.900 --> 02:05:57.900
Fuentes is there and they realize they're Nick

02:05:57.900 --> 02:05:59.900
Fuentes. I don't know. I don't think so.

02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:01.900
I think that that's

02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:03.900
writing a supervillain story

02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:05.900
where only a shithead, like a

02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:07.900
really dangerous shithead exists.

02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:09.900
We have a couple

02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:11.900
last clips here, and

02:06:11.900 --> 02:06:13.900
they're just a little check-in

02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:15.900
on how Alex's operation

02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:17.900
is going.

02:06:17.900 --> 02:06:19.900
He did a money bomb a little while ago,

02:06:19.900 --> 02:06:21.900
and he made a lot of money from that.

02:06:21.900 --> 02:06:23.900
But then he also decided to

02:06:23.900 --> 02:06:25.900
take a tank across the East Coast.

02:06:25.900 --> 02:06:27.900
So that was a bad idea from a...

02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:29.900
And then he's been flying all over the place

02:06:29.900 --> 02:06:31.900
and he goes with, like, a large security detail

02:06:31.900 --> 02:06:33.900
and then also has to broadcast

02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:35.900
remotely. Jesus.

02:06:35.900 --> 02:06:37.900
And apparently this hasn't been a great idea.

02:06:37.900 --> 02:06:57.900
He can't afford to do the nightly show now.

02:06:57.900 --> 02:06:59.900
He just canceled it for a week.

02:06:59.900 --> 02:07:05.900
Because I guess within a week he'll be back in Austin

02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:07.900
and the, like, manpower

02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:09.900
will be able to

02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:11.900
be moved. That's a thin

02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:13.900
operation. There is, like, no...

02:07:13.900 --> 02:07:15.900
If there's no one else to run

02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:17.900
the board, you can't afford to pay

02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:19.900
someone, I don't know, 20 bucks an hour

02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:21.900
or something? You can't get

02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:23.900
someone on, like, some freelance person?

02:07:23.900 --> 02:07:25.900
Guess not.

02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:27.900
Guess not. If that is the

02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:29.900
difference between, like,

02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:31.900
like, we have the money

02:07:31.900 --> 02:07:33.900
for it, we don't,

02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:35.900
that is a razor's edge.

02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:37.900
That's real bad. I don't know if that's

02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:39.900
actually true or not. I would assume that

02:07:39.900 --> 02:07:41.900
it's just not worth it.

02:07:41.900 --> 02:07:43.900
Yeah, that would probably make the most sense too.

02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:45.900
Yeah. And it turns out it was

02:07:45.900 --> 02:07:47.900
between that, cancel the nightly show

02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:49.900
or get rid of David Knight.

02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:51.900
It's just we don't have the forces

02:07:51.900 --> 02:07:53.900
to be able to have folks to run the shows.

02:07:53.900 --> 02:07:55.900
David Knight in the morning, Info Wars, my show

02:07:55.900 --> 02:07:57.900
during the day, The War Room. I mean,

02:07:57.900 --> 02:07:59.900
you know, which was it? Cancel the nighttime

02:07:59.900 --> 02:08:01.900
show or cancel David Knight? Well,

02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:03.900
cancel David Knight. We love him. So,

02:08:03.900 --> 02:08:05.900
but if you get to a point where the funding gets cut,

02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:07.900
David Knight goes away, or Ola goes away.

02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:09.900
Please keep buying products at

02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:11.900

02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:13.900
fight, 12th round, InfoWarStore.com.

02:08:13.900 --> 02:08:15.900
Great products, big sale about to end.

02:08:15.900 --> 02:08:17.900
Sean Rappaport, NoMoreFakeNews.com

02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:19.900
taking over. God bless you all. We'll see you

02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:21.900
in Georgia at the State Capitol.

02:08:21.900 --> 02:08:31.900
...

02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:33.900
...

02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:35.900
Oh, here she comes.

02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:37.900
Watch out boys, she'll chew you up.

02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:39.900
It takes zero for us to suddenly

02:08:39.900 --> 02:08:41.900
just start jamming a little bit.

02:08:41.900 --> 02:08:43.900
Look, it's totally lit. It's brutal.

02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:45.900
Brutal shift.

02:08:45.900 --> 02:08:47.900
I have no... We're all gonna die.

02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:49.900
I have no confidence

02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:51.900
in the staying power of my organization

02:08:51.900 --> 02:08:53.900
and I had to fire someone

02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:55.900
whether it be the nightly show or

02:08:55.900 --> 02:08:57.900
beloved David Knight and hey, you know what,

02:08:57.900 --> 02:08:59.900
if we don't get money, Owen might be gone.

02:08:59.900 --> 02:09:01.900
Get the fuck out of here Owen. Anyway, here's

02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:03.900
Hall and Oates.

02:09:03.900 --> 02:09:05.900
Here's a jaunty

02:09:05.900 --> 02:09:07.900
sax outro for the show.

02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:09.900
It's very, very jarring.

02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:11.900
Oh man, they just heard us.

02:09:11.900 --> 02:09:13.900
I've learned long ago, or

02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:15.900
maybe I should have learned long ago and

02:09:15.900 --> 02:09:17.900
learned fairly recently not to take anything

02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:19.900
at face value with Alex's

02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:21.900
financial talks.

02:09:21.900 --> 02:09:23.900
So this may mean something, it may

02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:25.900
just be a desperate ploy for money.

02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:27.900
I don't know, but if

02:09:27.900 --> 02:09:29.900
the nightly show is canceled for a week

02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:31.900
because Alex is in Georgia, that

02:09:31.900 --> 02:09:33.900
is not inspiring confidence in terms

02:09:33.900 --> 02:09:35.900
of... Maybe Deanna

02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:37.900
Lorraine just sucks. I mean, she does.

02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:39.900
She does! So maybe they're just

02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:41.900
creating a fake reason to be like Deanna.

02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:43.900
You suck.

02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:45.900
Yeah, we need to find a character for her.

02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:47.900
I'm not sure what it would be. I haven't watched

02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:49.900
enough of her to really know what character

02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:51.900
she would shine as in the way that

02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:53.900
Owen as the proxy on the street

02:09:53.900 --> 02:09:55.900
Joe Biggs as the mechanic.

02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:57.900
Monochromatic snatch.

02:09:57.900 --> 02:09:59.900
Oh, I see what you did there. Thank you.

02:09:59.900 --> 02:10:01.900
No.

02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:03.900
No.

02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:05.900
There's nothing better than

02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:07.900
making a little joke and having somebody

02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:09.900
say, I see what you did

02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:11.900
there. I just don't think that that

02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:13.900
conception of a character was any good.

02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:15.900
No, it was not. The parody of

02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:17.900
the social justice warrior

02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:19.900
archetype or whatever, it just

02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:21.900
had no legs. Even a good

02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:23.900
performer couldn't have pulled that off. I would say

02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:25.900
don't try and retread those boards. That's a bad

02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:27.900
idea. Yeah, I don't know.

02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:29.900
Whatever. We'll see

02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:31.900
what happens. Anyway, I was a little

02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:33.900
disappointed by Alex in Georgia.

02:10:33.900 --> 02:10:35.900
Just as a whole, I

02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:37.900
think that it was refreshing

02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:39.900
to hear him yelling in a bullhorn

02:10:39.900 --> 02:10:41.900
and people yelling back. Yeah, that's great.

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:43.900
Getting people excited. That's good stuff. But you also

02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:45.900
notice once you watch enough

02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:47.900
of it that it's like, this is really one note.

02:10:47.900 --> 02:10:49.900
Yeah. It's just that over and over again

02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:51.900
yelling the same catch phrases, the

02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:53.900
same sort of

02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:55.900
little blurbs.

02:10:55.900 --> 02:10:57.900
You wanna fight? You better believe you

02:10:57.900 --> 02:10:59.900
got one! And then everyone yells, yay!

02:10:59.900 --> 02:11:01.900
It's like him yelling his get-er-done

02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:03.900
or whatever. It's kind of,

02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:05.900
it wears on in a way that

02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:07.900
you shouldn't be in Georgia for multiple days.

02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:09.900
You should just be there

02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:11.900
for a sting and then

02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:13.900
get back to the fucking studio where you're needed.

02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:15.900
Yep, yep. But

02:11:15.900 --> 02:11:17.900
you know, it didn't work out.

02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:19.900
No. Georgia did not work for

02:11:19.900 --> 02:11:21.900
Alex. Again. Yes. Again.

02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:23.900
And this is coming out on Monday, so we'll know

02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:25.900
for sure, you know, the certification

02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:27.900
status. Yeah.

02:11:27.900 --> 02:11:29.900
But does not, oh I'm sorry,

02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:31.900
I mean with Michigan. Yes. If they were talking about that earlier.

02:11:31.900 --> 02:11:33.900
They were talking about Michigan. Pardon me, yeah. So we'll see you on

02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:35.900
that one.

02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:37.900
And I don't know, I just, I think this is

02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:39.900
going to fizzle, and they're going to need to find

02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:41.900
themselves on more solid ground.

02:11:41.900 --> 02:11:43.900
And it appears to me that solid ground, if

02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:45.900
they're smart, is

02:11:45.900 --> 02:11:47.900
a new

02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:49.900
Tea Party thing.

02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:51.900
Attacking the GOP. Yeah.

02:11:51.900 --> 02:11:53.900
Yeah, that would make the most sense. Yep.

02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:55.900
So we'll see.

02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:57.900
Ah, let's hope! Yep.

02:11:57.900 --> 02:11:59.900
We'll be back, Jordan, but until then, we have a website.

02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:01.900
We do have a website, it's KnowledgeFight.com.

02:12:01.900 --> 02:12:03.900
Yep, we're also on Twitter.

02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:05.900
We are on Twitter, it's

02:12:05.900 --> 02:12:07.900
UnderscoreFight at go2bedjordan.

02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:09.900
Yep, we're also on Facebook. We are on Facebook

02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:11.900
if you're downloading right to iTunes,

02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:13.900
and if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund

02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:15.900
in your area to help out people doing God's work right

02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:17.900
now. Yep, we'll be back, but until then,

02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:19.900
I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm

02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:21.900
dzxclark.

02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:23.900
I'm the Juiciest Ice Cube.

02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:25.900
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:29.900
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan,

02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:35.900
I love your work. I love you.
