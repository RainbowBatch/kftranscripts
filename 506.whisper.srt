N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,480
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,920
I have great respect for knowledgefight.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,360
Knowledgefight.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
I'm sick of them posing as if they are the good guys.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,360
Knowledgefight.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,360
Need, I need money.

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,360
Stop it.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,360
Andy in Kansas.

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,360
Andy in Kansas.

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,360
It's time to pray.

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
Andy in Kansas.

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
You're on the air, thanks for holding us.

18
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
Hello, Alex I'm a freshman color, I'm a huge fan.

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:01:01,280
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
I'm Jordan.

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,880
We're a couple dudes, let's sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about

22
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
Alex Jones.

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
Jordan.

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
Dan.

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Jordan.

27
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,880
Quick question for ya.

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,560
My question is, things that have been sent our way from the great areas of the world

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
that are not America.

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
Yes.

31
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,080
I got a nice package, yep, in the mailbag from Lee over in the UK.

33
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,760
Uh, oh my god.

34
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
What?

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
So much candy.

36
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Oh shit.

37
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
I ate it all already.

38
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Of course you did.

39
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,760
I was gonna say, anytime you say so much candy, I'm like, I didn't see a god damn dime, what

40
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,000
fucking, I didn't see any of this candy.

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,220
I saved you some wine gums.

42
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,840
Because I tried the last ones that came in another package from someone overseas, and

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
they were so terrible.

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
They're disgusting.

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,440
Your form of sharing candy is literally like, I picked out all the jelly beans I don't like

46
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
and I gave them to you.

47
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
Sure, you can have all the licorice ones.

48
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
Yeah, exactly.

49
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
Well the problem-

50
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
This one's popcorn.

51
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,740
The problem, as I see it Jordan, is that I go pick up the mail, and if there's candy

52
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,480
in it, you're not here when I open it up.

53
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,320
The clock starts when you open the candy.

54
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,680
I have to eat it.

55
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,560
Yeah, if it's like a three day window between you and me getting together, that's 72 hours,

56
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,280
I'm not gonna survive that candy length.

57
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,600
And I'm ready to, I'm really close to ready to say that the UK might have some of the

58
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,320
best chocolates and candies of the things that have been sent, for sure.

59
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,480
Canada's pretty strong too, but in terms of the ones that I've had, I think I gotta move

60
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
to London.

61
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
Just for the candy.

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,900
Oh well, America's chocolate is shit.

63
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,200
They're allowed to do different shit to American chocolate.

64
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
I'm not that guy.

65
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,080
I still think that we have some good chocolate options here.

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,640
We have very good chocolate options.

67
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,920
But man, some of these, oh god, just a crunchy, so good.

68
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
See, nothing will beat the-

69
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Honey, home.

70
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,240
Nothing will ever beat the Reese's Peanut Butter Egg.

71
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,400
It's simply impossible to defeat.

72
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,440
It's a good ratio.

73
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,440
It's perfect.

74
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
Yep.

75
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,000
So, we got that, and I'm sorry that I ate all the candy, but it is what it is.

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's fine.

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I saved, like I said-

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I've had enough candy in my life.

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,440
Wine gums for you and your partner.

80
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Enjoy.

81
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Thank you.

82
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:14,920
Also, got this nice package from Employmentless Eddy and Government Goat, G-A-U-T-E, out in

83
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,760
Norway, out in the Socialist Democratic Monarchy of Norway.

84
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,760
Love it.

85
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,400
Got you a couple novelty beverages.

86
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,240
Yes, currently drinking a Nordic raspberry hard seltzer.

87
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,500
This is a Beck, it means stream in Norwegian, apparently.

88
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,720
It's very, very good.

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,720
It's from Ager Brewery, or whatever, what's that letter that's an A and an E that are

90
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
connected to each other?

91
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Do you know that?

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
E.

93
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
You know that letter?

94
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
Yeah, it's E.

95
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
Okay.

96
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
It sounds like this.

97
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
E.

98
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
Okay.

99
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Eger Brewery, then.

100
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
I got a couple also of non-alcoholic seltzers.

101
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,160
I have not had a chance to dip into those.

102
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,320
And then some chocolates.

103
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,440
I have not eaten those yet.

104
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
You can have a couple of those.

105
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,120
Okay, I'll try a couple of those.

106
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,120
And you know, what's that bugle?

107
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
You know the bugles?

108
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
The corn?

109
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
The chip?

110
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,560
Yeah, that you put on your fingers so it'll look like a witch?

111
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Yes.

112
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
That's the one.

113
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
That's the bag of those covered in chocolate.

114
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
What?

115
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
You can cover those in chocolate?

116
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Apparently they do that in Norway.

117
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
I don't know if they can do that.

118
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Because they're fucking weird.

119
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,360
I think that might be against the law here.

120
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,520
So I'm going to read here from this note from Oslo.

121
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,640
So with every bite you get a chunk of social democracy, socialized healthcare, a function

122
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,940
in government, and or a secular society of fairly decent looking folks who spend their

123
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,280
days eating babies, worshiping Satan, and committing heinous atrocities against culinary

124
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,400
science through their national dishes.

125
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
All right.

126
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,680
That is maybe accurate based on the fact that it's chocolate covered bugles.

127
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
That does sound right.

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,420
Anyway, I have not tried those yet, but I'm sure they're going to be great, and thank

129
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,760
you to all our international wonks.

130
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,760
That sounds delicious.

131
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,200
What's your bright spot, Jordan?

132
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:53,280
I don't really have a bright spot so much as maybe a silver lining.

133
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,880
As you know, my aunt died earlier this year.

134
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,400
She did the old mortal coil shuffle.

135
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Sure.

136
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
If you recall.

137
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
That's what they call it.

138
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,680
Recorded by Fridge Perry and Walter Payton.

139
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Okay.

140
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,480
I know the joke you're making, the super bowl shuffle, right?

141
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Yeah.

142
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Yeah.

143
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
So yeah.

144
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,320
So T-Day, as I call it, was always her holiday.

145
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:26,720
Like she co-signed when I went to college the first time of my many jaunts.

146
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,480
My parents had terrible credit at the time, and she co-signed on my first student loan.

147
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,000
And literally at that time she was like, and you're never going to miss T-Day ever again,

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
are you?

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Ooh.

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah.

151
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,240
So she was a blackmail artist.

152
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
No, it was kind of a joke.

153
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
She was an extortionist.

154
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,240
It was kind of a joke.

155
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,800
You know, that kind of thing.

156
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
But at the same time it was also deadly serious.

157
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,720
You repaid the interest on this loan with the drawings of your hand as a turkey.

158
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,600
Exactly.

159
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
So yeah.

160
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,000
So this is a rough, this is the first one without her.

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,280
So it's a little bit rough, but I was reflecting on it.

162
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,440
And I think my silver lining is that I have no regrets.

163
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
You know?

164
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
That's good.

165
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,660
There are a lot of situations where you can lose a loved one and you'll regret something

166
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,760
like I wish I had done this before and all that stuff.

167
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,160
And I have no regrets whatsoever.

168
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:30,360
And I just had a solid relationship and I am terribly sad that it's over, but a lot

169
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,040
of people don't get that luxury of like, everything went how it was going to go.

170
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,080
I mean, hey, look, it's a bummer that you're talking about a loved one who's no longer

171
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,080
here, but it's a pretty amazing thing to be able to feel that way.

172
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
Yeah.

173
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Isn't it?

174
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Yeah.

175
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
It really is.

176
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,800
That's about as uplifting as you can get when you're talking about someone.

177
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
It really is.

178
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,200
And what's worse is because I didn't get the chance to say goodbye, the night I was going

179
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,240
to go see her and do that whole stuff, she died.

180
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,920
But I was even thinking about that.

181
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,900
I was like, is that a regret that I didn't get to say goodbye?

182
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:12,080
And then I was remembering when my grandfather died, her dad, we were at the nursing home

183
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,360
as just watching him.

184
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,940
It took him like a year to die.

185
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,320
And she literally turned to me and she's like, I would rather die than let people see me

186
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,200
like this.

187
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,880
That's how she fucking went out, man.

188
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,440
She died before anybody had the chance to see her like that.

189
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Skipping out the door.

190
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,760
She was like, I'm not dealing with you fuckers.

191
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
Good on her.

192
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,760
And out she went.

193
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
She got her wish.

194
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Lived the way she died.

195
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
Indeed.

196
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
Yeah.

197
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,760
Well, that's great.

198
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Yeah.

199
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Yeah.

200
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
It's silver lining.

201
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Happy Thanksgiving to you, Jordan.

202
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Yeah.

203
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
It's weird.

204
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
I mean, I know we're not supposed to celebrate Thanksgiving.

205
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,840
I mean, not that, but you know, the tradition of Thanksgiving and a lot of the imagery

206
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,360
around it is based on a sort of colonialist myth and all this.

207
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,000
I think there's a lot of people who have a lot of fair complaints about the holiday,

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,640
but at the end of the day, ultimately what it is about is, if you want it to be, is about

209
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,680
being grateful for things.

210
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,200
I think that certainly if we take the time to reflect, we have a lot to be grateful for.

211
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:13,680
And not just these fond memories of loved ones or weird things you can eat or drink

212
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,960
from overseas.

213
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
It's just great.

214
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
It's just great.

215
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,920
And I feel very wonderful being able to reflect on those things.

216
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:26,640
So thank you everybody who has made so many things for us to be grateful for.

217
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Yes.

218
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
Yes.

219
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
We are very, very grateful for many, many things.

220
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,040
One person I am not grateful to.

221
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
Who's that?

222
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,160
Alexander Emmerich Jones.

223
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
That motherfucker.

224
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Running things again.

225
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Yeah.

226
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,280
So Jordan, today we're going to be talking about him.

227
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
I know that's a shock.

228
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
We're going to be talking-

229
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
That's another character for us.

230
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,720
We're going to be talking about November 22nd to 24th, 2020.

231
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
I'm Dan.

232
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Hello.

233
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Hooray!

234
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Yay!

235
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm slowly moving back away from that.

236
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,960
I'm going to start saying god damn it again.

237
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,280
I'm no longer accepting this.

238
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
I gave it a shot.

239
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
Brought it back and forth.

240
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Yeah, sorry.

241
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,040
There's a, we're recording this a little later than we normally do.

242
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,520
We had to push back recording.

243
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,840
And there's a very specific reason.

244
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,000
And I think that you will immediately know what it is.

245
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,160
And I would like for you to yell bingo.

246
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
Not yell.

247
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
I understand.

248
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
We are recording a little later.

249
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
Sure, sure, sure.

250
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
Neighbors and all that.

251
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
I understand.

252
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
But I would like for you to say bingo.

253
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Okay.

254
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,880
Whenever you think you have discovered why we had to record later.

255
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Okay.

256
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
Alright.

257
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Okay.

258
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
So we'll get down to business on this episode.

259
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,360
But before we do, let's take a little moment to say thank you to some folks who have signed

260
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,360
up on our sporting show.

261
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
That's a great idea.

262
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,080
So first, Nicholas C. Thank you so much.

263
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,560

264
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,840
I'm a policy wonk.

265
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840

266
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840

Thanks Brigitte!

278

Thank you.

279
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Next, Dan the Bold.

280
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
Thank you so much.

281
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
You are now a policy wonk.

282
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
I'm a policy wonk.

283
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Thank you very much.

284
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Dan the Bold.

285
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Great Name.

286
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
Yeah.

287
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
Next, Dodd Snow.

288
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Thank you so much.

289
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
You are now a policy wonk.

290
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
I'm a policy wonk.

291
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
Thanks Dodd.

292
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Thank you.

293
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
Next Moose Work.

294
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
Thank you so much.

295
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
You are now Dan and Jordan.

296
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
I love you.

297
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
I'm a policy wonk.

298
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
I'm a policy wonk.

299
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
You are now a policy wonk.

300
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Thank you very much to all of whatever that was.

301
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,240
Finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple folks who donated on an elevated level, we appreciate that very much.

302
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,440
So first, Ugly Derek, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

303
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,240
And, Blavid Dane, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

304
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,840
I'm a policy wonk.

305
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew.

306
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,440
How's your 401k doing, bro?

307
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,040
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

308
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,440
Let's just get down to business.

309
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,240
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

310
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,040
Why are you pimps so good?

311
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
My neck is freakishly large.

312
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,840
I declare info war on you.

313
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,440
Thank you so much, Ugly Derek, and thank you so much, Blavid Dane.

314
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,040
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

315
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:55,040
If you're out there listening and thinking, hey, I enjoyed the show, I'd like to support what these gents are doing, you can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com, clicking the button that says support the show, or...

316
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:02,840
Ah, Dan, it's Tea Day, you know what kind of thing you need to do on Tea Day, be generous and care for the people around you.

317
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,040
You need to get, uh...

318
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,840
And go to a local charity or bail fund.

319
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,440
Oh, okay.

320
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Yeah, that would be my plan.

321
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:14,040
I was going to start reciting the lyrics to All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight, because this is a football holiday, my friend.

322
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,840
Mmm, not really a football guy anymore.

323
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,240
No?

324
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Actually, not a football guy at all anymore.

325
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,840
No.

326
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,040
Four years, cold, cold turkey.

327
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,040
Okay, cold turkey, not good for Thanksgiving.

328
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Not good for Thanksgiving, yeah, there we go.

329
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:35,040
Alright, so Jordan, before we get into this, we have a couple of out of context drops, and which would you like to go for?

330
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,840
Bingo!

331
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,240
Okay. Incorrect.

332
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,640
Okay.

333
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,440
Um, I'll just start with this one.

334
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,840
Surf means slave. Not a smurf, a surf.

335
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,640
Yep.

336
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,240
Alright.

337
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,840
Pretty good.

338
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,640
Okay, that's not bad.

339
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,240
Not bad.

340
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
That's good analysis.

341
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Yep. That was apropos of nothing.

342
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Sure, sure.

343
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,040
Just thinking of people who get confused that he was talking about the smurfs.

344
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
You gotta make sure.

345
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:11,640
Now, this is actually very exciting, this next out of context drop had no place in the episode, but it's very exciting, because it's something that I hope so badly that Alex continues, but I don't think he will.

346
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
Alright.

347
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:20,240
On a scale of one to five, you get five Hitler Mustaches. Wish you have a new thing there. You get five Hitler Mustaches.

348
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
I would love it.

349
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,240
I don't mind that. I don't mind that as a ranking system.

350
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,240
If you took the globalists and you rated them on a scale of one to five Hitler Mustaches.

351
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,240
I gotta be honest, I think if you're on the scale at all, it's bad.

352
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,840
It's not great.

353
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,840
I think Hitler only had one Hitler Mustache.

354
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
You, sir, had three Hitler Mustaches.

355
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,840
If you've got five Hitler Mustaches, that's way too many.

356
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
That is.

357
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:51,840
So, we started on Sunday, that's November 22nd, and Alex is still banging the gong of the voter fraud, and he has some very powerful people who are on his side.

358
00:12:51,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Ladies and gentlemen, the head of the Federal Elections Commission has gone public and said there was massive fraud orchestrated across the country against President Trump and against the American people.

359
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,840
That is coming up.

360
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,840
The current head of the Federal Election Commission is a fellow by the name of James Trainor, and he's a bit of a kook.

361
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Prior to his appointment, he had served as a counsel for Trump's 2016 campaign, and in his nomination hearing, he quote,

362
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:27,840
would not commit to a blanket recusal from matters involving the president if he's confirmed to the Federal Election Commission.

363
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,840
I imagine prior to that he was a used car salesman?

364
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Pretty cool stuff, and you gotta admire a guy who says in their job interview they're straight up not gonna commit to doing their job.

365
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Excuse me, what's the Constitution? No.

366
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:47,840
He was confirmed in May of this year after his nomination stalled in Congress for a few years, and he got in with a 49 to 43 vote on strict party lines.

367
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:57,840
James Trainor is not a great dude. He made headlines earlier this year when he did an interview with Church Militant where he compared the 2020 election to quote, spiritual warfare.

368
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:07,840
He also claimed that religious leaders who were tax-exempt should feel free to tell their congregants who to vote for since Trump released an executive order indicating that he wasn't interested in enforcing the Johnson Amendment.

369
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Trainor said quote, the bishops are using their nonprofit status as a shield to hide behind from having to make a decision about who to support, and to come out publicly.

370
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Bishops say we should have an informed conscience when we go vote, but they never really take that next step and say here's who meets the criteria.

371
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Oh boy.

372
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,840
In that interview he also made clear that he believes that the separation of church and state is a quote, fallacy.

373
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
Sure.

374
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:42,840
He elaborated quote, it was John Adams that said the Constitution presupposes a Christian moral people, which means you have to have that underlying principle in order for the Constitution to function and work properly.

375
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:49,840
What we see going on around the world is complete anarchy in places where the rule of law has been completely abrogated.

376
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,840
So it is a spiritual war that is striking at the underlying foundations of our constitutional republic.

377
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,840
It's getting rid of the Christian moral principles that are the basis of the foundation of the country.

378
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:09,840
One important thing to point out is that John Adams in his 1798 letter said that quote, our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people.

379
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,840
It's wholly inadequate to the government of any other.

380
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,840
It's James Trainor who's adding the word Christian.

381
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
Wow.

382
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:25,840
John Adams wasn't saying that the Constitution was only for Christians, he just had a philosophy that morality itself relied on religion because that's an appealing shortcut to a moral system.

383
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

384
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:37,840
This quote is used and misused by Christian zealots to argue that this is a fundamentally Christian country and even some go on to suggest that the Constitution and the rights protected by it, they don't apply to non-Christians.

385
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,840
Secondary to, yeah, yeah, yeah.

386
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:46,840
These people are fucked up dangerous cultists and it's fun to realize that the head of the Federal Election Commission is one such person.

387
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Also, two years prior to writing that letter, Adams had been part of the signing of the Treaty of Tripoli which was meant to establish commercial relations between the United States and Libya.

388
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:07,840
Article 11 of that treaty presented by John Adams to be ratified by Congress begins quote, the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.

389
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
Weird.

390
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:22,840
Yeah. Trainer's comments about voter fraud came up in an interview with Newsmax where he was just complaining about the same stuff Trump's campaign is talking about in Pennsylvania where they believe that unless their poll watchers get as close as possible to the vote counters, then there must be fraud going on.

391
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,840
Preferably with knives ready to scratch out Biden's name.

392
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
Yeah.

393
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:33,840
He said quote, I do believe there is voter fraud taking place in these places, otherwise they would allow observers to go in.

394
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,840
This is a pretty standard bullshit artist tactic and I'll just lay this out for you how this works on a very basic level.

395
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
So here's how it starts.

396
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,840
You allege that there's some problem going on.

397
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840
In this case, votes being fraudulently counted.

398
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:51,840
You have no proof that this is happening and it almost certainly is not happening but you need people to believe that it is.

399
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:57,840
You insist that this is a major problem and then you propose a solution to this problem that you know will not be accepted.

400
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,840
In this case, it's the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania mandating how the Philadelphia Board of Elections carries out their election.

401
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:12,840
You know that your demand is going to be thrown out because the complaint is frivolous and the remedy would require the infringing of a locality on its ability to run its own election.

402
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,840
It's certain to be rejected but that's good.

403
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,840
You didn't want the complaint to be accepted anyway.

404
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,840
If the complaint had been accepted, then things don't change at all.

405
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:29,840
The poll watchers are a couple feet closer and you probably slow down the process or try to make a scene out of something but it's not like you're going to find any actual fraud.

406
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:40,840
What works so much better is the complaint being thrown out because then you get to go around it and insist there must be a cover up going on or else your poll watchers would be allowed to do basically the counting themselves.

407
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,840
You know, they gotta get as close as they can. Get up in there!

408
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
You don't actually want the poll watchers to get closer.

409
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,840
You want that request to be rejected so your surrogates can then create the appearance of suspicion.

410
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,840
Everyone engaged in this knows exactly that this is the game.

411
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
Totally.

412
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:03,840
It's just outrageously tragic to see that someone so transparently craven could ever find themselves in the position of being the chair of the FEC.

413
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
That is a real bummer.

414
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:23,840
Yeah, I imagine that at the very least some of these douchebag republicans in government must be like, you know, when we hooked our wagons to Fox News 20 years ago, we thought we were going to be able to direct the mob and we wouldn't allow them into power.

415
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:34,840
But now the FEC guy said we should start a holy war in the 15th century again. And I don't think that's okay. But we got beat by Fox News.

416
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,840
Even Charles Koch is going around saying whoops.

417
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:46,840
Yeah, whoops, my bad guys. Didn't mean to destroy democracy. Just wanted to make a shit ton of money and kill people. Why is that wrong?

418
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Whoops.

419
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,840
Bummer.

420
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Yeah. Anyway, Alex is straight up. He's a real cool guy, and he wants you to know that if Trump had lost, he'd fucking tell you.

421
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,840
Sure.

422
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Let me just tell you up front here what we got for you.

423
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:08,840
I'm a realist. If Trump would have lost this election, I would have been completely honest about it and tell you I don't make stuff up.

424
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:15,840
I would have said Joe Biden needs to be arrested as a communist Chinese agent on record, along with his son, the rest of his scumbag family.

425
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Sure.

426
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,840
But that's another issue.

427
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
Sure it is.

428
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,840
Sure it is.

429
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:26,840
I would love to see how that played out. Like months of him being like, they're going to steal the election, and then Biden wins. He's like, you know what? I got to be honest. They didn't steal this one.

430
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Can you imagine? Can you imagine how long we spent listening to him say the only way it's a fair election is if Trump wins?

431
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Yeah.

432
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,840
For him to suddenly be like, guys, I got to be honest. This was a fair one.

433
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
Yeah.

434
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
And Biden won.

435
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Yeah.

436
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,840
That would be bullshit. I would be mad at him.

437
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:51,840
I got to be. I have nothing if I don't have my integrity. And I have to tell you, I'm eating crow on this one.

438
00:19:51,840 --> 00:20:03,840
Yeah. I would legit be furious. I would be furious. If Roger Stone just comes out now and he's like, guys, I did my research. This is a fair election. I would be furious with him.

439
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,840
But that's what's so funny about a statement like this. Like if he had won, I would tell you. No, you fucking would. Get the fuck out of here.

440
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,840
Of course not.

441
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,840
Yeah. Good times. So anyway, Alex gets to talking about.

442
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,840
Also, we didn't even account for the fact that he did win.

443
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
Oh, yeah.

444
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,840
He did win.

445
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
There is that.

446
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,840
You proved the. Yeah. Okay.

447
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,840
So the Supreme Court, though, they may be making moves in order to make sure that Trump actually does get in.

448
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
That's great.

449
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:41,840
The Supreme Court, unprecedentedly came in and changed.

450
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,840
In key battleground states, what Supreme Court justices were over what circuit?

451
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:55,840
And so who will be ruling on what cases to take from the circuits and who will have control of those rulings to fast track?

452
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:08,840
And they've put Gorsuch and they've put. Thomas and they've put Barrett and they put Alito and they've put Kavanaugh over the four key states.

453
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,840
So they are locked and loaded. A major signal. They see the fraud. They know the scam.

454
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
They're moving in.

455
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:21,840
So there is a new Supreme Court justice. So it's not at all surprising that there would be a new split of circuit court assignments.

456
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,840
Alex is saying this is unprecedented. I don't know what the fuck he's talking about.

457
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,840
This is not some weird thing where the you know, the the Supreme Court justice rules over all of their assigned circuit.

458
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:39,840
And as far as I can tell, this has just been really overblown by people in the the nonsense Alex Jones kind of world.

459
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,840
It's some kind of sign that there's an elaborate plan unfolding.

460
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
Sure.

461
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,840
It smells a lot like QAnon.

462
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Yeah. Yeah.

463
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
It's all very selective, too.

464
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:55,840
Like you can say that Kavanaugh is over the Sixth Circuit, which includes Michigan, and Clarence Thomas is over the 11th, which includes Georgia.

465
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,840
But for this to make sense, you have to ignore certain facts.

466
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Like, for instance, part of Alex's Stopping the Steel Tour 2020 was going to Arizona, which is in the Ninth Circuit under Elena Kagan.

467
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Weird. That's not part of his block of Trump lovers.

468
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
Well, Arizona's lost.

469
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,840
Sure.

470
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
Yeah.

471
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,840
And Pennsylvania is a state that Alex really does need to flip in order to make his stuff work mathematically.

472
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
Sure.

473
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
And that's under Alito, who he pointed out.

474
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,840
But historically, Alex has not been into Samuel Alito.

475
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,840
Well, now we've got a chance, though.

476
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
Right.

477
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,840
Yeah.

478
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,840
Look, I don't know. This is just silly.

479
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,840
It seems like someone grasping at straws, and I'm just not so into it.

480
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,840
Yeah. Which is also literally how they could have picked these judicial circuit.

481
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
Picking at straws?

482
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,840
Just grabbing straws.

483
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
It could have been.

484
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Yeah, it totally could be.

485
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,840
I'm not interested in talking about this because there's bigger things to go on.

486
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
Right.

487
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,840
Like, do you know what motivates Joe Biden and Kamala Harris?

488
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
I've got to go with blood.

489
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
No, it's not blood.

490
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,840
It's not blood.

491
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Make no mistake, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were picked because they want one thing, status and money.

492
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
They don't want to run.

493
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
That's two things.

494
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:15,840
Joe Biden and Kamala are known as, put me on private jets, give me money, give me palaces, give me caviar, give me sex, give me drugs.

495
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,840
And I don't want anything else.

496
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
The bottom of the barrel.

497
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,840
Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are about to release an album.

498
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
Isn't that Lil Wayne ten years ago?

499
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
What are we doing?

500
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,840
Give me caviar, palaces.

501
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,840
Is this the Carter III?

502
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
What's happening right now?

503
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,840
Drugs, sex.

504
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
You know Joe Biden on the streets?

505
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
He's always just like, oh yeah, you want something?

506
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Give me a palace.

507
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,840
2 Chainz is president now.

508
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:52,840
And 2 Chainz is also concerned about the relative tax rate of people, individuals making over $500,000 a year.

509
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:59,840
I'm fascinated by this like, yeah, on the streets, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are known as people who just want private jets, sex and money.

510
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,840
Really?

511
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,840
Really?

512
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
Really?

513
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,840
Really?

514
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,840
Really?

515
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
That's pretty awesome.

516
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,840
I do like, I do like the, the just, that's just throwing that out there.

517
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,840
Why not?

518
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,840
Why not?

519
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
Just throw that out there.

520
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
Yeah.

521
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,840
Biden and Kamala Harris fucking rappers.

522
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Who gives a shit?

523
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Toss it out there.

524
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,840
Over extravagant cartoonish pictures of rap excess.

525
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

526
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
It's young thug.

527
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,840
So, uh, Alex gets to talking about these, uh, these Trump suits that have been thrown out in, uh, in Pennsylvania.

528
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,840
And he has something to say about this judge.

529
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,840
Loves money, power, social status, caviar.

530
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,840
We're being gaslit.

531
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,840
We're being lied to.

532
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:54,840
That was an Obama judge that we knew was going to throw it out without even looking at the evidence in Pennsylvania.

533
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,840
And that's what Trump's lawyers said.

534
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,840
It's what I said.

535
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,840
To be clear, Alex and his audience may not know this, but the president doesn't appoint state Supreme Court justices.

536
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,840
They're elected in 38 states, whereas in 12, uh, other states, uh, other methods are used.

537
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,840
Typically gubernatorial appointment or selection by the legislature.

538
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:20,840
I guess the three states most relevant to Alex's hopes for a Trump win are Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Michigan.

539
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,840
And all three of them are states where the Supreme Court justices are elected.

540
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:31,840
There's no such thing as an Obama judge on these Supreme Courts unless you just define anyone who disagrees with you as an Obama judge, which seems to be what Alex is doing.

541
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
Yeah, that seems a lot easier than thinking about it.

542
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,840
He doesn't know shit.

543
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,840
No. No, no, no, no. Not at all.

544
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,840
Yeah. So, Alex is also, you know, he's in this, he's in this strange in-between place.

545
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:50,840
Um, and he seems to be, on this Sunday episode, this, uh, this November 22nd, seems to be really leaning pretty hard into doomsday preaching.

546
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,840
Sure.

547
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,840
You're going to be at a point where half the children you know by age five are dying with brain tumors.

548
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:09,840
You're going to witness total extermination, and you will finally meet God in your mind, or you will get on your knees to Satan, but you will go through the fire.

549
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,840
No one will escape. Not me, not you, not anybody.

550
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Okay.

551
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,840
It's pretty harsh. Um, there's a lot of doom talk.

552
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,840
Half of the five-year-olds I know, or half of all five-year-olds?

553
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,840
I think everyone, every five-year-old, yeah, not just you personally, not just Jordan.

554
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,840
Because, I mean, if I got to pick, we'll see.

555
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,840
I don't know any five-year-olds. I don't think I know any five-year-olds.

556
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,840
Well, then you're safe. You're safe.

557
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Yeah, I guess I won't see this hellish thing come to pass.

558
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,840
This is like Passover. You know, we're not going to have to deal with it.

559
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,840
The plague of the first born is not so bad if you don't have kids.

560
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,840
I mean, it's tough because you still care about your neighbors, about families and stuff.

561
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,840
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

562
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Uh, yeah, it's just very dark. Alex seems to be thinking that everybody's fucked.

563
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,840
Yeah.

564
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,840
And a lot of crazy shit's going to happen.

565
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,840
And then he remembers that Bill Cooper's book was called Behold a Pale Horse.

566
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
Pale Horse.

567
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,840
And he starts talking about that Bible verse.

568
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:16,840
I looked and behold an ashen horse, and he who sat upon its name was Death, and Hades was following with him.

569
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Authority was given to them over a fourth part of the earth to kill the sword with famine and pestilence with the wild beasts of the earth.

570
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:37,840
Let me tell you who rides that horse, who is the spiritual vessel of the Antichrist before the Antichrist comes is Bill Gates.

571
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,840
The man who sits on the white horse of Death is Bill Gates.

572
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
He's a middle man.

573
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,840
And now you see it. He is your world ruler.

574
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,840
He is the head of the G7. He is the last gate.

575
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
The gate of Gates?

576
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,840
The executor of you and your family.

577
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,840
He will kill you and your family when he's done.

578
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
And you will die.

579
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
Wow.

580
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,840
Shadow Gate. Bill Gate.

581
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,840
I want a concrete job for Bill Gates.

582
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:17,840
I feel like either he's constantly jockeying for and winning slash losing position or I think Alex might be making up a lot of the things Bill Gates does.

583
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,840
I think it's got to be Alex is making it up because you wouldn't have time to readjust to those shifts in position.

584
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
So often. Frequent.

585
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:32,840
I know that I've been in jobs and I've had internal changes in position, let's say.

586
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,840
You get moved to a different department or something.

587
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,840
When I worked at Groupon, I was in a couple of different places.

588
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,840
And man, you lose about a week of productivity.

589
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
Totally.

590
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,840
Trying to get reacclimated to the new workflow, the new responsibilities.

591
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,840
Moved our manager to this team and this team is now being run a different way.

592
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
You're using Salesforce a different way.

593
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,840
Totally.

594
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
You don't know what the fuck is going on.

595
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,840
Bill Gates could never be a middle man and then one of the council of twelve and now he's running the G7.

596
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,840
Totally.

597
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,840
And also rides upon the pale horse.

598
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
Right.

599
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Has he been death this whole time and has been Biden's time?

600
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,840
No. No. No. No. No.

601
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Look.

602
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
The pale horse has a few riders.

603
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
Okay.

604
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,840
I really didn't know that.

605
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,840
Bill Gates came in and was like, hey buddy.

606
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,840
C. Everett Koop was up there before.

607
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,840
Is it like a Twilight Zone episode? If you kill death, you become death?

608
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Is that how it works?

609
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Yeah, it's like the Santa Claus.

610
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Oh, okay. I gotcha.

611
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,840
So yeah, Alex is not only talking about how everyone's going to die and Bill Gates rides the pale horse.

612
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,840
He also wants to tell you about how much everyone loves him now.

613
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:55,840
I got calls the last three days from major world leaders, major people in government, the biggest people in media.

614
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:05,840
And they said, all of them said the same thing. They said, Jones, when we go to dinner parties or these big Hollywood parties or with these big events, everyone loves you now.

615
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,840
And everyone's asking about you.

616
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
It's not about me.

617
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,840
It's that I'm just I represent the resistance and people that are awake.

618
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,840
I've just been so right for so long that now everyone loves me.

619
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
Oh, man.

620
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,840
I ever I keep getting phone calls about how they talk about me at Hollywood parties.

621
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
Wow.

622
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Wow.

623
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
Wow.

624
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,840
Alex, it's me, the ghost of Nelson Mandela.

625
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,840
We love you in heaven now.

626
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,840
You're definitely going to be invited.

627
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,840
This sounds like a fucking bragging teen.

628
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840
Yeah, this is so transparently.

629
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,840
There's no reason.

630
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,840
It's somebody at the lunch table who's 15 being like, man, I just talked to somebody famous.

631
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,840
And you're like, I'm 15. I don't care.

632
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
Yeah, yeah.

633
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,840
I feel like my uncle knows Shaq.

634
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,840
All right.

635
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
OK, cool.

636
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,840
All right, man.

637
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,840
It doesn't raise your status or lower with me.

638
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,840
I don't know why this is happening.

639
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
Yeah.

640
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,840
I look I don't believe that anybody called Alex.

641
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,840
I don't believe I don't believe that anyone told them that there's people talking about him at Hollywood parties.

642
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,840
I don't believe that people are talking about him at Hollywood parties.

643
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Right.

644
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,840
But even if all of that was true, it still wouldn't matter.

645
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,840
Because I imagine the real world version of this is people at dinner parties being like, you hear this fucked up weirdo?

646
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,840
I feel like we would be more popular if famous people were talking about Alex Jones at dinner parties.

647
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Sooner or later, someone would be like, hey, did you know there's a podcast about him?

648
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,840
Can you believe these two dickholes in Chicago make this guy listenable?

649
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Yeah, exactly.

650
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
OK, hypothetical.

651
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,840
Yes.

652
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Brian Stelter calls, says everybody loves him at MSNBC.

653
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
What happens?

654
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,840
I think Alex critiques his appearance on the phone.

655
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,840
Alex tells him he looks weird.

656
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,840
I think Alex is like, look, Stelter, Stelter, Stelter, I love to hear that.

657
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
I love to hear that Tapper likes me.

658
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
We love you.

659
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,840
You look like a pedophile.

660
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,840
God damn it, Alex.

661
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,840
But we love you at MSNBC.

662
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
But the reason you love me is I tell the truth.

663
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
All right.

664
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,840
And I got to tell you the truth.

665
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,840
You're right.

666
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
You look like a clown demon.

667
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,840
This is why we love you, Alex.

668
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,840
Your integrity shines through in this phone call.

669
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
You're like the conspiracy.

670
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
There is Don Rickles.

671
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Yeah, hockey puck.

672
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Oh, man.

673
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,840
One of my favorite things about Alex is, in terms of his dumb ideas,

674
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,840
is that the globalists don't have children.

675
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
And I haven't heard him bring that up in a while.

676
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,840
So I was excited for it to come back.

677
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,840
This is a post-human system being built.

678
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,840
And I told some of these folks they have kids.

679
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
By the way, all people that call me have children.

680
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
That's why these globalists don't have children.

681
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
All of them.

682
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
All of them.

683
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Not that many of you haven't had children,

684
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,840
but the point is it creates a metaphysical thing where you're tied to humanity

685
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,840
even more and your ancestors into the future.

686
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,840
And it's just like it's a command once you have children.

687
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,840
Alex loves this talking point, which is nonsense.

688
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,840
You know, like the idea that the globalists don't have children.

689
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Sure, sure.

690
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,840
Joe Biden's the lead globalist in the U.S. right now,

691
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,840
and Alex knows better than anyone that he has at least one son,

692
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
since he can't stop complaining about him.

693
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
Stole him. Stole him from someone else's family.

694
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
What about Bill Gates? He rides the pale horse.

695
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,840
He's the globalist at the top of the rotation, and he has three kids.

696
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
Well, the horse is actually a horse costume,

697
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,840
so you have to have more than one person inside the horse costume.

698
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,840
But then he still has one extra kid.

699
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
You can't have three people in a horse costume.

700
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
Hey, he puts it on his shoulders.

701
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
I don't know about that.

702
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Klaus Schwab, the head of the World Economic Forum

703
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,840
and the author of The Great Reset,

704
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,840
that's another guy that Alex is really going on and on about these days.

705
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,840
He has two kids.

706
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
This is so dumb, and Alex says it all the time,

707
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,840
not because it's true, but because it underscores an important piece of his cosmology,

708
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,840
namely that there's something inherently suspicious or wrong

709
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,840
about people who don't view reproducing as the most important piece of life.

710
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,840
Yeah, yeah.

711
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,840
This isn't about the globalists having kids or not having kids.

712
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,840
It's literally a talking point just to throw out to make you feel like you need to have kids

713
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,840
and there's something wrong if you don't.

714
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,840
Yeah, I imagine, though, that that's probably, like,

715
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,840
a part of the grape replacement bullshit that they all believe in,

716
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,840
where it's like, hey, white people have to have more kids.

717
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
It could be.

718
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
That kind of thing, you know?

719
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,840
Yeah, it could be adjacent to that.

720
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,840
Because those quiver folk believe all that shit, you know?

721
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,840
Yeah, might be.

722
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,840
So Alex goes on to talk about here how he's ready to die, ready to die for the truth.

723
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,840
And then he gets some tears, and I'll leave it up to you to decide whether you think these are genuine.

724
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Okay.

725
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,840
And I'm ready to die. I'm ready to be imprisoned.

726
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,840
I'm ready to put in solitary confinement. I'm ready to be tortured for the truth.

727
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,840
Because I realize I can't sign on to the pedophilia and the Satanism.

728
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,840
In fact, it's a very easy...

729
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,840
I'm not into persecution. I'm not into masochism.

730
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,840
I don't like pain.

731
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
But I'll take it.

732
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
I'll take as much as they're going to give me.

733
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,840
Because that's so short compared to eternity.

734
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Because Jesus Christ is on the other side of it.

735
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,840
All right. All right, buddy.

736
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,840
And I wish we could have stopped this.

737
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,840
I really wish we could have.

738
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,840
But we can't.

739
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,840
We're going to get hurt for what we've done.

740
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,840
And quite frankly, we deserve it.

741
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,840
So, again, we're on this doom tip here on this episode.

742
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,840
I don't think that was sincere, really.

743
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,840
But here's my thought. Here's what I want to discuss.

744
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Sure.

745
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Alex has this persecution fantasy where he's like William Wallace being tortured.

746
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
Yeah, of course. Freedom.

747
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
And his last words are, freedom!

748
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
And he's also an anti-Semite, so it works well for him.

749
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
It's all across the board.

750
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
Yeah.

751
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,840
I want to ask you this, though.

752
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Do you think that...

753
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,840
The point that he wants to make is I'd be willing to do anything for the truth.

754
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
Sure.

755
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,840
Would he be willing to live in obscurity and poverty?

756
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,840
Oh, absolutely.

757
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
For the truth.

758
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
No, that would be very hard.

759
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Yeah.

760
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Yeah.

761
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
It's interesting to me to think about it.

762
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Like, well, okay, what if the truth required you to do a podcast out of your apartment?

763
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
Would you do that, Alex?

764
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,840
Would you give up your million dollar studio?

765
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I don't think you might not.

766
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Would you give up your perceived status symbols?

767
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:24,840
All of this pretending about talking to world leaders and dinner party chatter about you.

768
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
Yeah.

769
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:31,840
Would you give up the pretense of being the leader of the Patriot movement and Texas royalty?

770
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,840
Would you give up all that for the truth?

771
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,840
Because I don't think you would.

772
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
No.

773
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,840
You'd probably get tortured, though, because then, you know, that's just part of the persecution

774
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
fantasy.

775
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
If you get to go out a martyr...

776
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:48,840
Well, I mean, it's a lot more fun to think of dying instead of living with shit.

777
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,840
Right.

778
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Right.

779
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:55,840
I'd much rather die for my beliefs than live, like, really miserably forever.

780
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,840
Yeah.

781
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,840
Yeah.

782
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,840
It's harder.

783
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,840
It's a lot harder.

784
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,840
Yeah.

785
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
I don't think you'd be up for that.

786
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
I don't think you would.

787
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,840
No.

788
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
He thinks that dying is the hardest thing you can do.

789
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,840
And it's not.

790
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,840
It's very easy.

791
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:11,840
So Alex talks here about, again, it's just like, these are fucking scary times.

792
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
Bad stuff's coming.

793
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,840
God's going to judge us.

794
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Because now we're entering the scary time, and it just gets scarier from here on out.

795
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:25,840
And the men will be measured, and the women will be measured, and we're all going to be

796
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
measured.

797
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,840
We're all going to be put through the fire.

798
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,840
And I welcome the fire.

799
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,840
I welcome the fire!

800
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,840
I welcome the fire.

801
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
Sorry.

802
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Because it will cleanse us, and it will burn away the lies and separate the metal from

803
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,840
the trash.

804
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:53,840
And in that fire, we will find our ascendance, or we will find our destruction.

805
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,840
The real test is now here.

806
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,840
From here on out, the gates of hell have been opened.

807
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,840
What the fuck is he going on about?

808
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,840
Man, I swear.

809
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:10,840
I swear to God, if the culture at large gave it six months with a new Trump administration,

810
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,840
Alex would be like, yeah, burning witches is totally fine again.

811
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
Of course.

812
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
When did it ever go wrong?

813
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:22,840
I just like to imagine some people are like, hey, man, yeah, I don't like the Federal Reserve.

814
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:28,840
And then just by gradual weirdness intensifying, you get to a point where you're like, yeah,

815
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,840
the cleansing fire does need to come.

816
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,840
Everyone should be baptized in fire.

817
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
You're right.

818
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,840
That'll be purifying.

819
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,840
And if you can't float, well, we know what's going on with you.

820
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Yeah, that's like, this trajectory is strange.

821
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,840
But he's in a bad place.

822
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:56,840
And I will give him a little bit of a kudo, tip of the cap, in that he does end the show

823
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,840
more weird than threatening, I think.

824
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,840
This clip's a little bit longer.

825
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,840
It's about two minutes, because there's no way I could cut this at all.

826
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,840
This is just Alex begging leftists to accept Jesus.

827
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
Okay.

828
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,840
All right.

829
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,840
I'm listening. I got an open heart and an open mind.

830
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,840
It's very strange.

831
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,840
Let's give it a shot.

832
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:21,840
You know, if I was a globalist, I would see you and see you as an animal, see you as trash.

833
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Cool.

834
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,840
And I would feed on you.

835
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,840
But God's Spirit leaves me if I start thinking like that.

836
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
Easter sin, still going on.

837
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,840
I'm not going to treat you like that, but I will tell you straight up to your face.

838
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:38,840
If you are a Democrat, if you are a leftist, if you are an antifa, you're an idiot.

839
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:45,840
Literal Count Dracula, and then Prince Philip, who runs him, and Prince Charles, who are

840
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:53,840
the Dracula line, literally, literally, this is Hungarian, Romanian.

841
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,840
These are the dudes.

842
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,840
Sure.

843
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,840
For a thousand years, these are blood drinkers.

844
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:04,840
You are literally on your knees to the seed of Satan, the dragon.

845
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,840
And you think it's going to give you milk and cookies at night.

846
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
It isn't.

847
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,840
You are fools and you are in grave danger.

848
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,840
And I'm begging you, I'm begging you for your own soul.

849
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,840
We will destroy you.

850
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,840
God's going to destroy you.

851
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,840
I'm asking you to get off the side of Satan.

852
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,840
I don't want to destroy you.

853
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,840
Thanks.

854
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,840
No pleasure in this.

855
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
I don't want to destroy you.

856
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,840
I don't want God to destroy you.

857
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,840
I'm just begging you, please stop serving Satan.

858
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,840
Turn back now.

859
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,840
There's still time.

860
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,840
There's still time.

861
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,840
You can do it.

862
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,840
You can renounce Bill Gates.

863
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,840
You can renounce fallacy.

864
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,840
You can renounce Ted Turner.

865
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,840
You can renounce George Soros.

866
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,840
And you can accept Jesus Christ.

867
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,840
You've got to do it quickly.

868
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:54,840
There isn't much time.

869
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,840
This is such a serious situation.

870
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,840
Please, please turn back now.

871
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,840
God doesn't want to destroy you.

872
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,840
God doesn't want to annihilate you.

873
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,840
He wrote a book about it.

874
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,840
But you've got to reject the power of the earth.

875
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,840
You have to reject Satan or you don't have any hope.

876
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,840
You must reject Joe Biden.

877
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
So let me ask you.

878
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,840
As an open hearted leftist who has just heard Alex Jones' plea.

879
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,840
This is the best he can do.

880
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,840
How do you feel?

881
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,840
Are you ready to renounce Anthony Fauci?

882
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Uh, I mean, yeah.

883
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,840
I really don't have a problem with that.

884
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,840
I'll just pick somebody else who's very competent.

885
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,840
I don't have any attachment to Fauci.

886
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:50,840
Fauci could be replaced with another talented, like that's it.

887
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,840
It's certainly much less attachment than you have to someone like, let's say, Prince Philip.

888
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,840
Who you are desperately attached to.

889
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:07,840
I do find it hilarious that he kind of correctly, let me put it this way.

890
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:14,840
He embodies the point of Dracula, which is that foreigners are very weird and we should be terrified of them.

891
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
Prince Philip?

892
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,840
That's what I'm saying.

893
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,840
I mean, he's British, obviously.

894
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,840
He's not from America.

895
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:27,840
And in the same way, you know, Dracula was written to terrify people about the eastern block of Europe coming over into their homes.

896
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,840
Stealing their women and such.

897
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,840
I guess. I'm not that scared of Prince Philip either, though.

898
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,840
I think we should be.

899
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,840
Alright, fair enough.

900
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,840
So, we get to the 23rd now.

901
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:43,840
And this episode opens with Alex, I would say, accepting that Biden is going to win.

902
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
Sure.

903
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
But he's reframing it a little bit.

904
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,840
Okay, good.

905
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:56,840
We are 58 days now in the overthrow of our republic and the installation of a foreign Chinese backed communist agent known as Zhou Baidu.

906
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,840
So, that's how it is now.

907
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,840
It's going to happen, but it's the overthrow of the country.

908
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,840
Sure, sure, sure.

909
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:12,840
So, we know that Alex has this thing that he talks about all the time, which is Operation Lockstep, which is what he has made up or cribbed from a meme or something.

910
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
Absolutely.

911
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,840
About a 2010 document from the Rockefeller Foundation.

912
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:26,840
What is it called? The Future of Technology and International Development document.

913
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:31,840
And he's turned those memes about that and all this shit into Operation Lockstep.

914
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,840
It almost got deeply, deeply exposed on Rogan's podcast.

915
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,840
Very close.

916
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:50,840
So, him and Tim Dillon and Jamie were just not able to synthesize the information, take it in well enough to rebut Alex's points in real time, which is something that Alex benefits from.

917
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,840
Yeah, no, they really teamed up to do a shit job and fuck over everybody.

918
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,840
Well, yes, but also, again, I think I said this on the episode.

919
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
I know.

920
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,840
It's a complex thing.

921
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,840
It would be very difficult to know nothing about it.

922
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
They did do a bad job.

923
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,840
But I don't know if they could have done a good job.

924
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,840
Exactly, exactly. I know full well.

925
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,840
I just want to make that clear. We're not piling on...

926
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,840
No, no, no, no.

927
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,840
Except in the places where it's deserved.

928
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,840
Yeah.

929
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,840
That's not one of them. That's not a fair criticism.

930
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,840
They should have known ahead of time.

931
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:25,840
Yeah, exactly. The biggest problem, before they even began, they were outgunned and had no chance.

932
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,840
Yes, yes.

933
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,840
So, Alex is now turning this into something else.

934
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,840
This is now, like, Lockstep is something he's known about forever, man.

935
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,840
Of course!

936
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:44,840
Eleven years ago, I put out a little documentary called Endgame 2.0.

937
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,840
It's since been taken off the internet. It was internet only.

938
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,840
Didn't put a DVD out.

939
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:58,840
And in that film, we laid out their plan to collapse society and their plan to trigger an economic collapse using a virus.

940
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:06,840
And the reason I knew that was it had just come out in the Operation Lockstep, which is now about eleven years ago.

941
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,840
Right off the top, Operation Lockstep is not a thing. That is all just made up.

942
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,840
Alex did not know about the term Lockstep when he made the film Endgame.

943
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:20,840
It's a very recent element of his conspiracy theories that he's been trying to retcon into being part of his work all along.

944
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,840
It's absolutely 100% not true.

945
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:30,840
Alex started bringing up the word Lockstep immediately after people like Jim Fetzer started misrepresenting that Rockefeller document,

946
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:36,840
scenarios for the future of technology and international development, and memes started spreading about those misrepresentations.

947
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,840
That's the actual basis for Alex's reporting.

948
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,840
But let's entertain Alex's lie here, though, and let's tease this out.

949
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:50,840
He's claiming that in the updated version of Endgame, he knew all this stuff that was going to happen because he's read this imaginary Lockstep plan.

950
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,840
Right. That hadn't been written at that time.

951
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,840
That is the big problem.

952
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,840
Yeah, that is an issue.

953
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,840
There's another problem.

954
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,840
What's that?

955
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,840
There's no such thing as Endgame 2.0.

956
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,840
Okay, well that's also a bit of a problem.

957
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,840
Alex is referring to Endgame 1.5, which was his...

958
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,840
That was the supplementary director's cut of Endgame.

959
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,840
Sure, sure.

960
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,840
That came out the same year as the original film, which was 2007.

961
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:14,840
The Rockefeller document that the Lockstep conspiracy is based on wasn't written until 2010.

962
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,840
There's an issue?

963
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,840
Yeah. There's an... Oh!

964
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,840
What's that?

965
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,840
We forgot that Alex is psychic.

966
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,840
Oh, shit! Shit, fuck.

967
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,840
He can see the future.

968
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,840
He keeps forgetting.

969
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,840
In his dreams.

970
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,840
Shit!

971
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,840
Keep forgetting about that.

972
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,840
Timelines be damned.

973
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,840
You know, it's really hard to fact-check somebody who can see into the future.

974
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,840
Yeah.

975
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,840
That's an issue.

976
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,840
And I refuse to engage with it, quite frankly.

977
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,840
I'm gonna...

978
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,840
What, the second sight?

979
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,840
I've been thinking about this for a while.

980
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,840
I think I gotta just come out with it.

981
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,840
I don't believe he's psychic.

982
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,840
I don't know how that's going to...

983
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
Oh boy, Jordan's leaving.

984
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,840
Jordan's taking off his headphones.

985
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,840
I don't...

986
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,840
And I can't.

987
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,840
I can't believe he is because then this becomes a silly exercise.

988
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,840
Yeah, that becomes a real problem.

989
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,840
Not that this isn't silly to begin with.

990
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:09,840
Of all the ones that I facetiously entertain, and even defend, that one I just never touch

991
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,840
because fucking, I'm out.

992
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,840
I'm out when you say you're psychic.

993
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,840
Yeah, it's fun to think that he thinks he is, but...

994
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,840
Yeah.

995
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,840
Yeah.

996
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,840
The other thing too that I want to point out about this is this is such a really good example

997
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:26,840
of these things that Alex does where he tries to insert current things into his past work.

998
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,840
Yeah.

999
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,840
Like a lot of his work is so vague and so, you know, it's in the documents, it's in the

1000
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,840
white papers, you know, all the, I have the documents, I can prove everything and then

1001
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,840
nothing's ever proven.

1002
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,840
Yeah.

1003
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,840
Everything is so hyper nonspecific that, like, he complains about the Rockefellers all the

1004
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,840
fucking time.

1005
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,840
Sure.

1006
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,840
And yeah, you could find tons of him talking about the Rockefellers trying to take over

1007
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,840
the world ten years ago.

1008
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,840
Right.

1009
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,840
You can go to Endgame and find talk of the Rockefellers.

1010
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,840
Totally.

1011
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,840
Being evil.

1012
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,840
He did not know about a document that would be written three years later when he made

1013
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,840
Endgame.

1014
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,840
But it looks good now.

1015
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:06,840
It is unfortunate that part of the game of being so vague and tossing so much shit at

1016
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,840
the wall is if you want to say, like, oh, I knew about Operation Lockstep eleven years

1017
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:17,840
ago, and then toss that shit out, you can be like, okay, well, here's a clip of me saying

1018
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,840
that the Rockefellers are going to kill everybody and that it's in the white paper.

1019
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:27,840
The white paper I was referring to was the as heretofore yet unwritten, you know.

1020
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,840
That clip may exist somewhere, but I went and I found the, like, release, like, sort

1021
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:38,840
of article on Prison Planet about the Endgame 1.5.

1022
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,840
Sure.

1023
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,840
There's no mention of the Rockefellers, there's no mention of Lockstep, none of this shit.

1024
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,840
It was a big road, though.

1025
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,840
It's just like, hey, man, we're going to have more interviews with Big Chimp Jim Tucker

1026
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:49,840
and Daniel Estelin.

1027
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,840
Wait, did you say Big Chimp?

1028
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,840
Big Jim.

1029
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,840
I heard Big Chimp and I was like, ooh, Big Chimp Tucker?

1030
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,840
I like that name way more.

1031
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,840
That would be better.

1032
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:05,840
What is it, a giant chimpanzee or a really old chain-smoking anti-semite?

1033
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,840
I'll take the chimp.

1034
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,840
I will also take the chimp.

1035
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,840
So Alex is talking about Klaus Schwab a whole bunch.

1036
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,840
The guy who wrote this great reset book.

1037
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:21,840
And he has one particular thing that he says about him that is worth saying is not true.

1038
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,840
The populist movement spreading across the world is stronger than ever.

1039
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:31,840
And now you've got Boris Johnson and you've got John Kerry and you've got all these world

1040
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:37,840
leaders saying the COVID-19 lockdown is a punishment to populists to bring them under

1041
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:42,840
control and they admit it's a social movement and Klaus Schwab says it's not a threat.

1042
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,840
COVID-19 is not a threat.

1043
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,840
All that's nonsense, but it is worth pointing out also that Boris Johnson is now on the outs.

1044
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:55,840
He is no longer the heroic populist that Alex claimed he was because I guess he's taken

1045
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,840
COVID seriously.

1046
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,840
Yeah, he had to do the lockdown and so, you know.

1047
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,840
Now he's a globalist.

1048
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:08,840
Yeah, unfortunately whenever you eventually succumb to reality, everybody who's unreality

1049
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,840
does not like you anymore.

1050
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,840
Anybody who's still committed to this will turn on you very quickly.

1051
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,840
So also I want to talk about this Klaus Schwab thing.

1052
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:23,840
He's claiming that Schwab admitted in his book The Great Reset that COVID-19 is not a threat.

1053
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,840
Alex is doing this based on a cherry picked quotation that reads,

1054
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:31,840
quote, unlike certain past pandemics, COVID-19 doesn't pose a new existential threat.

1055
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,840
This quote is taken out of context to imply that he's saying that COVID isn't really a threat

1056
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,840
and it's just being used to take over society.

1057
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,840
Sure.

1058
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,840
If you actually go to the text, you'll find that the words, quote, new existential threat

1059
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,840
have a specific meaning in the context of the writing.

1060
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:50,840
This quote is found after a discussion of the bubonic plague and the germs that were brought to

1061
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:55,840
North America by the first European explorers, which is why the word new is in that sentence.

1062
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,840
Yeah, there's that.

1063
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,840
Those were instances of new existential threats to populations.

1064
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,840
COVID-19 is dangerous and deadly, but it's not the bubonic plague.

1065
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,840
And I don't think that's a controversial take.

1066
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,840
Schwab isn't saying that COVID-19 is not a threat.

1067
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,840
Just that, quote, unless the pandemic evolves in an unforeseen way,

1068
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:17,840
it's not going to be something that poses an existential threat to the world like the plague.

1069
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,840
Alex is taking that quote out of context and giving it the context he wants it to have, which isn't real.

1070
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,840
Alex hasn't read this book, and I would go so far as to say that his researchers probably haven't either.

1071
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,840
I say this because that quote is taken from the introduction to the text.

1072
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,840
So I could see them finding that and being like, good enough.

1073
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,840
Good enough.

1074
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,840
That'll do.

1075
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,840
Don't worry about it.

1076
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,840
Let's go to lunch.

1077
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,840
Oh boy.

1078
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,840
I don't know if you've heard this.

1079
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,840
Jordan?

1080
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,840
Yeah.

1081
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,840
I don't know if you've heard this news.

1082
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,840
What was that?

1083
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,840
Did you hear that people are talking about Alex at dinner parties?

1084
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,840
I did not hear about that, actually.

1085
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,840
And by the way, I just want to give you some good news.

1086
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,840
We're going to go to your calls and get to the big news next segment.

1087
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:59,840
I've gotten calls, I get a lot of calls, but I've gotten calls from some of the biggest people out there.

1088
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:04,840
And they said, man, Alex.

1089
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,840
It's incredible when I go to these dinner parties in New York or dinner parties in L.A.

1090
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:17,840
or I'm talking to, you know, top people, household names, all they want to talk about is you and all they want to talk about is the future.

1091
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:23,840
And this one individual this weekend was like, what's it like to have everybody now accepting you and celebrating you?

1092
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:28,840
And I'm like, it's good to know people are finally understanding we're not playing games.

1093
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,840
What's it like to have movie stars throwing banquets in your honor?

1094
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:40,840
What is it like for Rick Schrader to call you up and say, man, you remember when I was in pool hall junkies?

1095
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,840
We really crushed it in that movie.

1096
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,840
Anyways.

1097
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:49,840
Alex, what is it like for James Woods to have commissioned a bronze sculpture of you in his front lawn?

1098
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,840
Alex, what is it like?

1099
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,840
I got a call from the chair that Clint Eastwood talked to. I am talking to big people.

1100
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,840
I'm guessing he got a call from Coach Dave.

1101
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,840
Totally.

1102
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:05,840
Someone sent me a video of him saying that Alex is the leader of their movement.

1103
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,840
Oh boy.

1104
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:12,840
And my immediate response was like, well, add four info warriors to the tally.

1105
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,840
I feel bad that we did an episode about that dude.

1106
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,840
Yeah, me too.

1107
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,840
Quite frankly, given how irrelevant he is.

1108
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,840
I have no idea how little...

1109
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,840
We were punching laterally at the time that we did the Coach Dave, though.

1110
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:31,840
I think I got tricked by the fact that Right Wing Watch would have posts about him.

1111
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,840
Sure, sure, sure. From time to time.

1112
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,840
I thought for sure this is somebody who is much more relevant than they are.

1113
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,840
No, he has like a hundred views on his channel.

1114
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,840
It's really Right Wing Watch's fault.

1115
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,840
Eh, I understand why you... I mean, they're supposed to watch the Right Wing.

1116
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,840
He has a Right Wing voice, but I thought he was somebody who had a bit more of an audience than he did.

1117
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,840
Now that Jared Holt's gone, I'm going to shit all over Right Wing Watch.

1118
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,840
Oh shit.

1119
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,840
Yeah, that's right. I'm a Holt stan.

1120
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,840
You just like that dog. You just like his dog.

1121
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:07,840
So yeah, I don't know. I don't think that Alex is getting these calls, like I said, but he is very fixated on this.

1122
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:15,840
And interestingly, as he's being feted by the people who are the most important in society,

1123
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,840
the heads of state, the media figures, celebrities.

1124
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,840
Everybody.

1125
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,840
It just so happens that his every move is being watched by the feds.

1126
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,840
Bummer.

1127
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:30,840
Do you understand that I get followed home every day by Black-ish Yves?

1128
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:35,840
When I eat in restaurants, FBI and CIA, we ran it, we checked it.

1129
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,840
FBI and CIA come and sit next to us.

1130
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,840
And when I come over, they put masks on and say, have a good day, Mr. Jones.

1131
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,840
They go wait in the parking lot.

1132
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,840
They put masks on?

1133
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,840
Mission Impossible masks?

1134
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,840
I go across the street and have a hamburger.

1135
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,840
Federal agents follow me.

1136
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,840
And they want me to know they're there.

1137
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,840
This is the type of stuff that happened to Martin Luther King.

1138
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,840
What?

1139
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,840
Wow. Wow.

1140
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,840
Wow, we're going for it.

1141
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,840
That's narcissistic.

1142
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,840
We're shooting for it, huh?

1143
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,840
But I really do love the idea of like some guy being like, hey, Alex.

1144
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,840
I'm CIA.

1145
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,840
I want you to know I'm here.

1146
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,840
Enjoy your hamburger.

1147
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,840
Hey, Alex, I'm CIA.

1148
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,840
My buddy here is FBI.

1149
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:19,840
We are working on a joint task force about your diet.

1150
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,840
What the fuck is this stupid shit?

1151
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:28,840
I think that could legitimately drive a real paranoid person insane if people were actually doing that.

1152
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:33,840
I think if people actually did that to Alex, he would feel so validated.

1153
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,840
Like it would make him feel good.

1154
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:43,840
I think if you're a paranoid narcissist who also has a modicum of celebrity, you might have people who interact with you who are like fans.

1155
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,840
Sure.

1156
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,840
Or something.

1157
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,840
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

1158
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:51,840
And then because your brain doesn't interpret information correctly, you could be like, oh my god, that guy was CIA.

1159
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,840
Sure.

1160
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,840
Because they're wearing a mask and maybe they're in a suit or something.

1161
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,840
You're a noticeable person.

1162
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,840
Yeah.

1163
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,840
People turn and look whenever they're in a restaurant and they're like, hey, is that Alex Jones?

1164
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,840
Or maybe one time he was coming home from work and there was a black van that happened to be behind him.

1165
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1166
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,840
Not every fucking black van is the feds.

1167
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,840
Grow up, man.

1168
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:21,840
That would be an easy, I think that would be an easy situation that we should, nobody who's not in law enforcement, nobody who's not a fed can have a black van.

1169
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,840
I think that's the new rule.

1170
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,840
That way we can all identify them all the time.

1171
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,840
I think they would be against that.

1172
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,840
I'm sure they would be.

1173
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,840
Alex would be against that.

1174
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,840
I'm sure he would be too.

1175
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,840
Black van enthusiasts would be against that.

1176
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,840
Well, we can, you have to, okay, fine.

1177
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:41,840
You have to paint a unicorn or a dragon on the side of your black van if you are not a fed.

1178
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,840
I think we could reach this compromise.

1179
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,840
I think that's a good one.

1180
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,840
So this is real strange.

1181
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:54,840
This is real, like he had this doom and gloom sort of like God's cleansing fire is going to purify the world on Sunday.

1182
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,840
Yes.

1183
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,840
Now on Monday.

1184
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,840
Not long ago.

1185
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,840
He's continuing with these fantasies about how all the celebrities love him now.

1186
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,840
Sure, sure.

1187
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,840
And everybody is watching his every move.

1188
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,840
All the law enforcement.

1189
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,840
And then I got this news.

1190
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:14,840
When you decide to spread the word and when you decide to share the info and download it and save it,

1191
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,840
because there may be a coming time when we're not here.

1192
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:22,840
I mean, I've been waiting a while to say this may be my last broadcast and I've never done that in 27 years on air.

1193
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,840
Oh, really?

1194
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,840
Tomorrow I'm going to have discipline.

1195
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,840
I'm going to do my last broadcast ever hypothetically, because it could be.

1196
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,840
I mean, now's the time.

1197
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:31,840
Now's the time.

1198
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,840
Bingo!

1199
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,840
Neighbors, neighbors.

1200
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,840
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1201
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,840
Yes, that is correct.

1202
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,840
That is correct.

1203
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,840
Yeah, of course.

1204
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,840
The hypothetical last episode.

1205
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:51,840
I was like, all right, no matter what, the 24th is either going to be the day that he sets out to do his last episode,

1206
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:58,840
or it will be yet another time that he has said he is going to and completely fucks up.

1207
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:07,840
Your eyes and your joy every time he sets you up only to make you disappointed is beautiful.

1208
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,840
Palpable.

1209
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,840
After all these years, Dan.

1210
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:15,840
Still crazy after all these times Alex said he was going to do his last episode.

1211
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,840
I could not be more excited when I heard that.

1212
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,840
I thought, hooray.

1213
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,840
To the point where I almost just turned off this episode.

1214
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,840
Yeah, I'm surprised that we're not skipping ahead to the 24th now.

1215
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:30,840
Well, we've got to listen to some calls, because Alex takes some calls.

1216
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,840
Great.

1217
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,840
Man, not a great session.

1218
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,840
Eli's on the same subject in Indiana.

1219
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,840
One of info words is taken out.

1220
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,840
Go ahead.

1221
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,840
Hello, Alex?

1222
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,840
Yes, you're on the air.

1223
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:47,840
Hi, yeah, it's Elle, and I go by Elle, but it's Andrew Elle.

1224
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,840
Wow, I can't believe I got this.

1225
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:56,840
So, really, my big question is, I'm wondering, like, how am I supposed to get our information

1226
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:01,840
if they succeed in shutting down?

1227
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,840
Then she hung up.

1228
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,840
Okay.

1229
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,840
Well, sorry, ma'am.

1230
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,840
Very bizarre.

1231
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,840
I think they hung up on her.

1232
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:12,840
But you've got to have that cough button there for that asshole exhale.

1233
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,840
I agree.

1234
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,840
I will say this.

1235
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:22,840
I think Alex and I both experienced the same thing, which is that I did not hear a single

1236
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,840
word that she said.

1237
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:29,840
I think for him, it was because he responded to her name with just, like, ugh.

1238
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,840
Yeah, he was not happy about it.

1239
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:36,840
And for me, it was because I could not stop laughing at him just hearing a name and going,

1240
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,840
ugh.

1241
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,840
He's very pissed off.

1242
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,840
Does he know, or is it just that it's Andrew Elle?

1243
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:50,840
I think the problem is that he said the wrong name, and then she corrected the name but

1244
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,840
gave too much of a correction, and he doesn't care for this kind of thing.

1245
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,840
No, that's true.

1246
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,840
Well, she also did the thing where she asked if she was on the air, which we all know sets

1247
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,840
him off.

1248
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,840
Yes, he has a hair trigger with that.

1249
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,840
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1250
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:09,840
So he gets another call, and this person wants to talk about hypothetical violence.

1251
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:14,840
I'm not calling for any type of physical violence, but it could get to that point.

1252
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:19,840
If they keep going down this road, what are we going to do?

1253
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:25,840
What must they think of us to do what they did, and we just accept that?

1254
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,840
I just can't go along with it.

1255
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,840
I can't go along with it.

1256
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,840
I'm in the same boat.

1257
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,840
Alex is eating lunch.

1258
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,840
Yeah, of course.

1259
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,840
I did that.

1260
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,840
Delicious.

1261
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,840
I did that because I have to always...

1262
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,840
You love it.

1263
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,840
Yeah, yeah.

1264
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,840
I love catching him take a chop.

1265
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,840
There are recurring themes in the show.

1266
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,840
I think that's the most important of them.

1267
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,840
Honestly.

1268
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,840
Yeah, I think so too.

1269
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,840
I think so too.

1270
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,840
Yeah.

1271
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:52,840
So this last call here on the 23rd episode that we're going to listen to a little bit

1272
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:58,840
of is sort of a natural Infowars kind of caller.

1273
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,840
This is not good.

1274
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,840
I didn't enjoy hearing this.

1275
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,840
Look, I don't have anything against Jewish people.

1276
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,840
My wife is Jewish.

1277
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,840
Stop.

1278
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,840
My wife is Jewish.

1279
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,840
I have Jewish children.

1280
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,840
But what is online?

1281
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,840
What is Jesus?

1282
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,840
What is the murder of the Tsar?

1283
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,840
And what does dominion have in common?

1284
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,840
There's all occult Jews behind it.

1285
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,840
And people...

1286
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,840
I know that dominion is hooked into Venezuela.

1287
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,840
I know that CNBC's done reports on it being a fraud.

1288
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,840
It's been decertified in a lot of states.

1289
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,840
For the people trying to act like we can just trust dominion is just ridiculous.

1290
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,840
So this caller is trying to speculate that there are occultic Jews who are behind stealing

1291
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:40,840
the election as well as the murder of the Tsar and all sorts of pretty much every nefarious

1292
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,840
thing throughout history.

1293
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1294
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:47,840
And Alex's response is like, hey man, dominion Venezuela.

1295
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:53,840
Instead of being like, hey guy, how about you calm down with this anti-semitic tropes?

1296
01:01:53,840 --> 01:02:00,840
Bruh, I've been doing one thing for 20 years and that is telling people I'm not an anti-semite.

1297
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,840
And now you're making me say, well, I mean some Jews.

1298
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,840
Yikes.

1299
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,840
That's not good.

1300
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:07,840
Yeah, that caller was bad.

1301
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,840
Yeah.

1302
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:15,840
So, we get to the 24th and I was a little bit worried that Alex wasn't going to do his

1303
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,840
last show.

1304
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,840
Why would you be worried about that?

1305
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:22,840
Is that a long, long, long, long, long track record of not following through on promises?

1306
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,840
He consistently doesn't do those things.

1307
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:29,840
So, I was very shocked when he started the show like this.

1308
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:34,840
I put a headline up today that I've thought about doing for a long time, but haven't done

1309
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,840
yet for the live show.

1310
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,840
And it says it all.

1311
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:41,840
It says, this might be my last broadcast, Alex Jones.

1312
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:46,840
And I have had many points in my life where I've almost said this on air because the situation

1313
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,840
was so serious, but it never rose to the occasion.

1314
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:55,840
I'm not saying it's my last broadcast, but now I have to treat every minute on air as

1315
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,840
if it could be my last.

1316
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,840
And I'm going to explain to you why and really just tell you the truth.

1317
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,840
Do it.

1318
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,840
It's the only thing I can do.

1319
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,840
Do it.

1320
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,840
About how serious the situation is and what we're facing.

1321
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,840
Do it.

1322
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,840
Yeah.

1323
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,840
So, I think that this was the biggest cop out.

1324
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:13,840
Yeah.

1325
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:17,840
It's like, okay, yeah, this is going to be my last, but it's just saying like, let's

1326
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,840
live each day like it's our last.

1327
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1328
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,840
It's this bizarre, like a weird motivational nonsense.

1329
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,840
Yeah.

1330
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,840
And people even go biblical on him and say, this is lukewarm.

1331
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,840
Yeah.

1332
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:34,840
And we all know how the great feels about lukewarmity.

1333
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:41,840
I kind of wanted a little more out of the idea of a last episode than just this.

1334
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,840
Sure.

1335
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,840
It seemed a little flat to me.

1336
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,840
Yeah.

1337
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:49,840
I wanted a little bit more pageantry, but he does actually get a little dramatic.

1338
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,840
This is a little dramatic.

1339
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,840
Maybe not as dramatic as I want it to be.

1340
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:59,840
If Joe Biden's able to wiggle his way into the White House and scam his way into the

1341
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:05,840
White House and get the nuclear codes and all the rest of it, then I will officially

1342
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:10,840
make the statement and put an article out declaring the United States dead.

1343
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:11,840
Dead.

1344
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,840
And creating a tombstone.

1345
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,840
Hell, I'm not even having it carved in stone.

1346
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:21,840
In fact, I will and placed here in the TV radio newsroom.

1347
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,840
Newsroom.

1348
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,840
And it'll be on sale at...

1349
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,840
Yeah.

1350
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:26,840
That'll be a great gimmick.

1351
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,840
Buy yourself a tombstone of America.

1352
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:29,840
I could have a keychain of that.

1353
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,840
Yeah.

1354
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,840
I would take a keychain of that.

1355
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,840
We're going to have shirts with hats.

1356
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:34,840
Totally.

1357
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:35,840
We'll have pills shaped like tombstones.

1358
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:40,840
Honestly, I think we should do that first just to get out from under, just to steal

1359
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:41,840
it first.

1360
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,840
I think that'd be hilarious.

1361
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,840
Look, I don't want to turn into Kiss, like when they're selling coffins and stuff.

1362
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,840
That's fair.

1363
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:48,840
That's fair.

1364
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,840
That's fair.

1365
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,840
It's too much.

1366
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,840
It is.

1367
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,840
Tombstones.

1368
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,840
No, we might have to go to a boutique shop for that.

1369
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,840
Might have to go to Redbubble for that.

1370
01:04:58,840 --> 01:04:59,840
Yeah.

1371
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,840
Yeah.

1372
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,840
So, I mean, all right.

1373
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,840
I think that's a little dramatic.

1374
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,840
Maybe.

1375
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,840
But I should say that Alex is being very serious about this.

1376
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,840
Okay.

1377
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:09,840
Let me just get into it right now.

1378
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:13,840
So I'll normally come on and tell you what's coming up, then end up spending an hour just

1379
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:17,840
getting into the basic news and never hitting the heart of the matter.

1380
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:23,840
But let me just now square up and just tell you the awful truth.

1381
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,840
Do it.

1382
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:25,840
It's bad.

1383
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:26,840
We're done here.

1384
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,840
Admitting it's bad, we have a shot at stopping it and turning it around.

1385
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,840
But that tombstone is very real.

1386
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:35,840
Okay.

1387
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,840
All right.

1388
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:50,840
United States of America born July 4th, 1776, United States of America died January 20th,

1389
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,840
2021.

1390
01:05:53,840 --> 01:06:00,840
Because if we don't admit how grave the situation is, we don't have a shot at stopping this.

1391
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,840
He's definitely going to try and sell that tombstone.

1392
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,840
Oh, totally.

1393
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,840
Also, I like the pun, how grave the situation is.

1394
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,840
I know, it's great.

1395
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,840
Not bad.

1396
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,840
It's great.

1397
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,840
Not bad, Alex.

1398
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:14,840
And he did do what I appreciate the most, which is avoid saying pun not intended.

1399
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,840
Sure.

1400
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:16,840
I like it.

1401
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,840
Attend your puns.

1402
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:18,840
Take some restraint.

1403
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:19,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1404
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,840
So Alex has never put out a headline like this.

1405
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,840
This is maybe my last show ever.

1406
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,840
Sure.

1407
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:26,840
He's talked about it a whole lot.

1408
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:27,840
Of course.

1409
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:28,840
On his show.

1410
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:29,840
And the idea of doing that headline.

1411
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:30,840
Pretty much all.

1412
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,840
But he's never done that headline.

1413
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,840
Okay.

1414
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,840
And it turns out they fucked up the headline.

1415
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:34,840
Oh no.

1416
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:38,840
I have been reading and studying The Globalist for 30 plus years.

1417
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,840
I've been on air for 27.

1418
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:46,840
And I've never put a headline out like they just had on screen.

1419
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,840
This could be my last broadcast.

1420
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,840
Tune in if you want to save yourself.

1421
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,840
Never put a headline out like that.

1422
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:58,840
The Globalists have accelerated their timetable and are planning to engineer a complete global

1423
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:06,840
collapse on the ashes of which they will construct.

1424
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,840
What?

1425
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,840
The new future.

1426
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,840
Oh.

1427
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,840
I shot that out in a voice memo real quick to the fellow filling it out before I went

1428
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,840
live and he didn't quite get exactly what I said.

1429
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:18,840
Talking 100 miles an hour.

1430
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,840
So we'll fix that headline.

1431
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,840
My fault.

1432
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,840
Good last show.

1433
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,840
Good stuff.

1434
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:24,840
Really.

1435
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,840
Send an email.

1436
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,840
Write it down.

1437
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:33,840
I was talking really fast because I had just done a bunch of speed and voice memo probably

1438
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,840
was incoherent.

1439
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,840
You know what?

1440
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:45,840
If a comic had an absurd intro that had to be part of the whole bit, they wrote it down

1441
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,840
for you.

1442
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:47,840
You bet.

1443
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,840
They wrote it down for you.

1444
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,840
They didn't say like, hey repeat this after me.

1445
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,840
No.

1446
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,840
Hey, I have a tongue twister that you need to memorize.

1447
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,840
Exactly.

1448
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,840
Yeah.

1449
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:56,840
That's what they have to be.

1450
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,840
Yeah.

1451
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,840
I would say that he's been talking about doing his last show forever.

1452
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,840
He's decided, fuck, I'm going to do it.

1453
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:05,840
Prepare.

1454
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,840
Yeah.

1455
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,840
Isn't it supposed to be a time capsule thing?

1456
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:09,840
He wings it.

1457
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:17,840
Isn't the idea of his last episode to be like, in case I go off air, this is like a bottle.

1458
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,840
This is a bottle episode that will stand up to greatness.

1459
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,840
Going out like the Sopranos.

1460
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,840
He's who he is and then the lights go off.

1461
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,840
The end.

1462
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:28,840
No finale.

1463
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,840
No wrapping up anything.

1464
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,840
He does have a very serious message though.

1465
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:33,840
What's that?

1466
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,840
Well, do you want to know what his biggest message is?

1467
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:36,840
What's that?

1468
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:41,840
And the biggest message I have before I give you my personal message here is to the people

1469
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:47,840
that serve the system, the yuppies, the trendies, the leftist enforcers.

1470
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:48,840
Sure.

1471
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,840
You're the biggest chumps of them all.

1472
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,840
You're the biggest schmucks, the biggest fools.

1473
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:53,840
And I don't say that with pleasure.

1474
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,840
I wish you weren't so delusional.

1475
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,840
You think you're part of the ruling class.

1476
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,840
You think you're part of the eugenics takeover.

1477
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:02,840
You think you're part of the winning team.

1478
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,840
You are anything but that.

1479
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:14,840
You are the weak traitors that actually chose to join this evil because you were seeking out power.

1480
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,840
I think that Alex would think that we're leftist enforcers.

1481
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:19,840
I guess.

1482
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:26,840
I mean, if he had to wrestle with our existence, it would obviously say that we're trying to shut him down.

1483
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,840
Totally.

1484
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,840
We're like some Soros plant or some bullshit.

1485
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:30,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1486
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:36,840
And I can say fully, I mean I've checked in on this a lot and really thought about it.

1487
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,840
I'm not thinking I'm part of the power structure.

1488
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,840
No, no, no.

1489
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,840
I don't think I'm part of the establishment.

1490
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:48,840
Honestly, I can think of very few times in all of human history when leftists felt like they were on the winning side.

1491
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:54,840
Yeah, I even want to take it more granularly and just talk about you and me.

1492
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:57,840
You're one of three or four people that I see.

1493
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:58,840
Sure, sure.

1494
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,840
Or talk to on a regular basis.

1495
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,840
I mean, yeah, we're not yuppies or trendies.

1496
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,840
You, my parents, Soros.

1497
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,840
Sure.

1498
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:08,840
That's it.

1499
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,840
Yeah.

1500
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,840
Oh shit.

1501
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:11,840
Yeah, that's all three.

1502
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,840
I blew it.

1503
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:19,840
No, I find this to be a really bizarre thing for him to say.

1504
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:25,840
It's like his big message is like, you people are chumps.

1505
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:26,840
God.

1506
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:34,840
His last message is like a playground insult based in vindictiveness and misunderstanding the people you disagree with.

1507
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,840
Great.

1508
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:36,840
Who cares?

1509
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,840
Your last message is a waste.

1510
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:39,840
Trivia.

1511
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:40,840
So annoying.

1512
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,840
Anyway, you remember how globalists don't have kids?

1513
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:44,840
Yes.

1514
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,840
Remember that?

1515
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,840
100% of globalists don't have kids.

1516
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:48,840
Right, right, right.

1517
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:49,840
Correct.

1518
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:50,840
Yeah, Alex said that on Sunday.

1519
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:51,840
Yes.

1520
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,840
Yeah, yeah.

1521
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,840
This is their takeover with Ted Turner and Bill Gates.

1522
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,840
None of them have kids.

1523
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,840
Cloud Schwab and all of them.

1524
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:58,840
Warren Buffet.

1525
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:06,840
Doesn't have kids.

1526
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:19,840
To shut down the free market capitalist society, they say to save the earth, but really it's to give them total power and control when they live the most opulent lifestyles and have all these children.

1527
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,840
Wait, wait, hold on.

1528
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:21,840
They have all these children.

1529
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,840
I thought they don't have kids because it's a post-human future.

1530
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,840
Oh, maybe nothing you say means anything.

1531
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,840
Dan, he's right 99% of the time.

1532
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,840
He's not right 100%.

1533
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,840
That would be unreasonable.

1534
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,840
Oh, okay.

1535
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,840
Well, here's another time he's wrong.

1536
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:35,840
Okay.

1537
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,840
There's a photo of Fauci 15 years ago.

1538
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,840
Doesn't have kids.

1539
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,840
With Tom Brokaw, George Soros.

1540
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,840
None of whom have kids.

1541
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,840
Barbara Walters, Brooke Astor.

1542
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,840
That's Anderson Cooper's lady, mommy.

1543
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,840
Anderson Cooper's mom is Gloria Vanderbilt.

1544
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:54,840
Yeah, that would be who she is.

1545
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,840
Alex should know that because he keeps talking about how he's the last Vanderbilt, but she's not.

1546
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,840
He's kind of gone on about it.

1547
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:01,840
Can't keep his enemies straight.

1548
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:06,840
Brooke Astor had one child who died in 2014 at the age of 90.

1549
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,840
Significantly older than Anderson Cooper.

1550
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,840
Taken too soon.

1551
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,840
Yeah, so I guess we've got to put that to 98% right?

1552
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:14,840
98% right, okay.

1553
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,840
The batting average is going down.

1554
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:17,840
Uh-huh.

1555
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,840
So this is supposed to be his last episode, right?

1556
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:21,840
Yes.

1557
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:29,840
And again, I've already brought this up, but I'm really struggling with this because it shouldn't be time-stamped.

1558
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,840
Yeah.

1559
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:31,840
It shouldn't be dated.

1560
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,840
So if I were Alex, I would stay away from headlines.

1561
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:41,840
I would stay away from, like, things that are going to be like, oh, this is November 2020 stuff right here.

1562
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,840
Just do a victory lap if it's your last show.

1563
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:44,840
Bingo.

1564
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:45,840
You do a victory lap.

1565
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,840
You do, like, here are all of our achievements.

1566
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,840
Do a fucking commentary for Endgame.

1567
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:51,840
Anything.

1568
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,840
Do a this is your life.

1569
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,840
Yeah.

1570
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,840
Yeah.

1571
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,840
Although you wouldn't be able to get too many of his former acquaintances.

1572
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,840
A lot of them might not come back.

1573
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,840
Instead, what he does is, like, just headlines and shit.

1574
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:09,840
New York City will have COVID checkpoints at T-bridges and crossings.

1575
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:24,840
They will grab people out of their cars and buses and take them to testing sites to provide education and quarantine.

1576
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,840
So that's martial law.

1577
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,840
That's the secret police.

1578
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,840
So this is based on some reality.

1579
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:36,840
There are COVID-19 checkpoints in New York, but they aren't set up to stop everyone like you might imagine when Alex says checkpoints.

1580
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:42,840
It's specifically about people arriving in New York from out of state, and it won't be so much like they snatch people up.

1581
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,840
There's testing on site.

1582
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:52,840
And then there's they want to advise people arriving to the city about quarantine requirements and the fact that you could be hit with a fine if you don't follow them.

1583
01:13:52,840 --> 01:14:00,840
I don't like this much because, you know, it's kind of scary, but also I don't like this pandemic and people not taking it seriously.

1584
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:01,840
So here we are.

1585
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:09,840
Also, I'm much more interested in another part of the sheriff, Joseph Fuchito, his comment about this stuff.

1586
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:24,840
OK, quote, deputy sheriffs are investigating massive events that violate a panoply of criminal fire building, health and other regulatory laws at locations such as illegal fight clubs, underground raves and illegal gambling dens.

1587
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:33,840
These activities were illegal and sometimes deadly before COVID-19, and the public safety hazards regarding them have been amplified exponentially by the pandemic.

1588
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:43,840
I did not know that illegal fight clubs were a modern problem in New York, but I want Alex to talk more about that instead of this other bullshit.

1589
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:51,840
Deadly illegal, you know, the problem the problem that we're seeing now in 2020 is too many people in New York are cool.

1590
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,840
I should have known.

1591
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,840
I mean, I guess I don't know.

1592
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,840
I guess I should have assumed there would be fight clubs.

1593
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,840
I just I mean, I don't know.

1594
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:03,840
I don't know.

1595
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,840
I mean, I'm not saying it's not possible that there aren't fight clubs, but it does seem to be.

1596
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,840
Underground boxing? Like it's not like Fight Club the movie.

1597
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,840
I would hope not.

1598
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:14,840
I would assume.

1599
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,840
Although somebody does need to blow up MasterCard.

1600
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,840
It's a strange thing to read in that statement.

1601
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:19,840
That is a little weird.

1602
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,840
Raves? Totally understand.

1603
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:22,840
Totally understand.

1604
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,840
Yeah, of course.

1605
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,840
I'm aware that those exist.

1606
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:25,840
Always going to happen.

1607
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,840
Some sort of underground gambling.

1608
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,840
Even in war-

1609
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:28,840
That makes more sense to me.

1610
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:31,840
War-torn countries have underground raves and underground gambling.

1611
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:32,840
Sure.

1612
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,840
Fight clubs, though, bro.

1613
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,840
That's the first one on his list.

1614
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:37,840
Yeah.

1615
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,840
That makes it sound like fight clubs are a real issue for him.

1616
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,840
Yeah.

1617
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,840
This is my third fucking fight club this week.

1618
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,840
That's before raves on the list?

1619
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,840
Is even more like what?

1620
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,840
Anyway, I think Alex is burying the lead on this one.

1621
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,840
So this will live on as his final episode.

1622
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,840
And unfortunately, certain things will not look so good.

1623
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,840
Oh, no.

1624
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:02,840
A lot of his COVID feelings, in particular, not great.

1625
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:06,840
And if you go to one of these centers, they will kill you.

1626
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:12,840
Not your average hospital, but the special COVID centers are leftist execution docs.

1627
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:13,840
Yeah.

1628
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:14,840
So if you go to a COVID center-

1629
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:15,840
Yeah.

1630
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,840
We're leftist-

1631
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,840
You go get tested for COVID and they put you in the hospital with COVID.

1632
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,840
Leftists are going to kill you.

1633
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:26,840
A leftist execution doc, though, does sound like it could be a doc for executing leftists.

1634
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,840
Sitting on the leftist execution doc of the bay.

1635
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,840
Nice.

1636
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:31,840
Watching.

1637
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:32,840
I don't know.

1638
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:33,840
Don't worry about it.

1639
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,840
Thanks.

1640
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,840
Let's move this one on.

1641
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,840
So it turns out they won't just kill you, these leftists.

1642
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,840
Okay.

1643
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:40,840
They'll also laugh at you.

1644
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:41,840
Oh.

1645
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,840
You didn't die of COVID.

1646
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:48,840
They kill you with you chained down, blowing your lungs out.

1647
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:53,840
And they get off on it, reportedly walk over and laugh at you when you're chained down.

1648
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,840
They're going to kill you and your family.

1649
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,840
They love it.

1650
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:57,840
God, they love it.

1651
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:58,840
Reportedly.

1652
01:16:58,840 --> 01:16:59,840
Reportedly.

1653
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,840
Reportedly is doing a lot of work for one adverb.

1654
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,840
Yeah.

1655
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:07,620
I mean, for the people who are first responders and people who are in the medical field who

1656
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:13,800
are being deeply traumatized by virtue of the help that they're providing and what they

1657
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:21,140
have to see, this is such a disgusting thing to be putting out into the world.

1658
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:24,720
This sort of perspective is just shameful.

1659
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:29,600
One, it ranks in terms of his career.

1660
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:35,080
He said a lot of really fucked up horrible things that this kind of thing continuously,

1661
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:41,820
this characterization of medical professionals dealing with this crisis, it's up there with

1662
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:42,820
Sandy Hook.

1663
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:44,400
It's up there with the Boston bombing.

1664
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,400
Totally.

1665
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,400
It's disgraceful.

1666
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,400
No, we can talk about-

1667
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,800
It may not be legally actionable necessarily, but it's as gross.

1668
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:51,800
Right.

1669
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,880
And this goes back to our earlier conversation too.

1670
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:00,800
We can talk about all the hundreds of thousands of deaths which are fucking terrifying and

1671
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:06,760
tragic and awful, but at the same time, there are millions of people, millions of people

1672
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:12,260
who are going to live with the effects of this fucking psychic destruction for the rest

1673
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:13,260
of their lives.

1674
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:21,440
And not to mention people who don't die, but have effects and lingering health consequences

1675
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,240
that aren't captured by statistics well.

1676
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:29,000
That is an untold story that people have to live with.

1677
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,160
I mean, just something small like, hey, guess what?

1678
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,360
For the rest of your life, you have shortness of breath forever.

1679
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,420
That's it.

1680
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:39,880
And you're like, I understand that that's fucked.

1681
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:40,880
It's just fucked.

1682
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:41,880
Yeah.

1683
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,160
Maybe you were a runner before and now you're not.

1684
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,160
Never again.

1685
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,160
Right.

1686
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:51,920
There are tons of things like that and then the situations that doctors and nurses are

1687
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:57,840
put in, the people who are medical professionals who have been infected themselves.

1688
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:58,840
It's just disgusting.

1689
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:05,400
I mean, the evolution from they're just fucking in the hospital and getting drunk to they

1690
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,640
kill you and laugh at you.

1691
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:08,940
Just go fuck yourself.

1692
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:13,440
These people would have happily executed Clinton for Benghazi.

1693
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:14,440
Yeah.

1694
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,440
You know?

1695
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,440
Yeah.

1696
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,440
Like happily.

1697
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,440
They would have executed Bill.

1698
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:19,440
They might even.

1699
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,920
Yeah, they would even perhaps have laughed while they were strapped down.

1700
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:23,920
Yeah.

1701
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,920
Yeah.

1702
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:25,920
Poor Charlie Daniels.

1703
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,160
Can't tweet about it anymore.

1704
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,160
No.

1705
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,160
Poor guy.

1706
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,480
So look, that's shitty.

1707
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:35,320
And I think it's important to take those moments and be kind of serious about it because it

1708
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,320
is serious.

1709
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,320
It's fucking awful.

1710
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,320
No, it's tragic.

1711
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,500
But there's also time to laugh.

1712
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,880
Like when Alex talks about Daleks with swabs and guns.

1713
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:43,880
It's too good.

1714
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:44,880
I've got bad news for you.

1715
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:45,880
What's that?

1716
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,880
Are they back?

1717
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:47,880
The Daleks are back.

1718
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:48,880
Oh.

1719
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,880
Do we have an update?

1720
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:50,880
Okay.

1721
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:51,880
They have been disarmed.

1722
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:52,880
They have been disarmed?

1723
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,880
Did we disarm them?

1724
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:54,880
I think we might have.

1725
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:55,880
I think we did it.

1726
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:56,880
I think we laughed.

1727
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,240
We're leftist enforcers, Dan.

1728
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:04,000
I think we laughed too much at it that now the Daleks are not armed.

1729
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
That's good.

1730
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
No, it's not.

1731
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
It's terrible.

1732
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
No, that's smart.

1733
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
It's good on their part.

1734
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,520
Get rid of the cars and make you ride those trains where there'll be the nice little checkpoints

1735
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:16,600
and the police officers with the little robots that come up and look like a Dalek and a Doctor

1736
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,720
Who.

1737
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:24,740
And there'll be armed cops behind them and they'll shove a swab and oh, here in the database,

1738
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:32,000
you go bye-bye to a secret COVID facility staffed by Antifa doctors.

1739
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,200
Okay.

1740
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:38,280
You know, it's those small things that make me know he's listening.

1741
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:43,600
It's those small things where you're like, you knew the guns in the Daleks was too much.

1742
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,880
It was too funny and too stupid.

1743
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,880
It was too good.

1744
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,280
It was too good.

1745
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,120
You found out and we all know.

1746
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:53,320
Like Icarus, you flew too close to the sun with that one.

1747
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,400
The Daleks were great.

1748
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:59,880
The swabs were fantastic, but you had a compartment with a gun in it and you've gone too far,

1749
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:00,880
sir.

1750
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,640
Yeah, you're into like hilarious territory.

1751
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:04,640
Exactly.

1752
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:11,280
And that's why now it's a fucking Dalek with a swab and there's cops with guns behind them.

1753
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,320
That's somehow silly.

1754
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:16,040
That's silly as shit to me because now we're not just sending Dalek.

1755
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,240
Now we've increased our infrastructure costs.

1756
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,240
Well, certainly.

1757
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:24,080
Now you have cops who are working with Dalek partners, which sort of raises the question

1758
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,980
why you couldn't just have the cops swab people.

1759
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:33,500
I got a new movie for you, sequel to Canine Cop, Dalek and Hanks Solving Crimes.

1760
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:34,500
I could see that.

1761
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,500
I could watch that.

1762
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:36,500
Yeah.

1763
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:40,320
So also we're, we're sort of really hyper focused on the Dalek and we're not talking

1764
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,720
about how there are Antifa murder hospitals.

1765
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:43,720
Well, sure.

1766
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:44,720
Sure.

1767
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,840
But I mean, we always know those in there.

1768
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,160
We're leftists and forcers, Dan.

1769
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,560
We don't need to worry about that.

1770
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:54,360
Oh my God, Antifa murder hospital.

1771
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:58,900
I sometimes wish we were as cool as they think we are.

1772
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:04,100
I would love for that to be like the next Blumhouse movie or something.

1773
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:10,200
Like it could be like a real B kind of horror movie that caters to the conservative audience.

1774
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,200
Yeah.

1775
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,200
Yeah.

1776
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,200
Yeah.

1777
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,200
Antifa murder hospital.

1778
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,200
Yeah.

1779
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,200
Yeah.

1780
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,200
Yeah.

1781
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,640
But then at the last moment they're like, actually it was a false flag by the Nazis

1782
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,840
and the Antifa murder hospital was a Nazi.

1783
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:21,840
I'm sorry.

1784
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:22,840
I'm sorry.

1785
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:23,840
I'm getting excited.

1786
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:24,840
Especially don't yell Nazis.

1787
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:29,720
If you're going to yell something, bingo is justifiable.

1788
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,860
I'm pretty sure you can yell Nazis in a crowded theater.

1789
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:33,920
That was never settled.

1790
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:38,480
I just don't want the neighbors to get some sort of very weird idea about what's going

1791
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,480
on.

1792
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:44,800
I do like the idea that there that we're suddenly screaming like, Oh shit, Nazi showed up.

1793
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:50,320
So Alex has a new thing to complain about, a new primary source.

1794
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:53,760
And we'll get into it a little bit after he talks about it.

1795
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:54,960
What I'm telling you is the truth.

1796
01:22:54,960 --> 01:23:01,100
You just saw a UN Rockefeller lockstep plan put out 10 years ago when they put lockstep

1797
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:08,120
out on paper saying what you just saw with the woman in charge.

1798
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:11,180
She doesn't ever get to see her family.

1799
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:12,220
She can't travel.

1800
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:20,300
She gets meat once a year, her husband's looked into a robot machine for them, what they're

1801
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:23,180
going to be, what they're going to do.

1802
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:29,560
That wasn't some cartoon made by George Arwell saying, Oh, this is terrible.

1803
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:34,160
They're saying this is good because they're showing children that.

1804
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,200
Since you asked, the one day a year is on her birthday.

1805
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:37,200
Is it on her birthday?

1806
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,200
Okay, good.

1807
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,200
Good.

1808
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:43,960
So this is a little thing called plannedopolis and Alex is presenting this with no evidence

1809
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:48,760
and saying that it's, or I mean it does exist, but he's without evidence, he's claiming this

1810
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:51,840
is something that was forcefully shown to kids.

1811
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,520
And I think that, you know, it's possible that it might've been shown in some classrooms

1812
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:00,080
in an educational setting, but I'm certain he's making it up because it's a cartoon and

1813
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:05,320
it's believable that it could be shown in classrooms to indoctrinate the kids.

1814
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:10,160
As somebody who knows his Miyazaki history, I'm pretty sure that Orwell worked on Spirited

1815
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:11,160
Away.

1816
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:12,160
Perhaps.

1817
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,160
Yeah.

1818
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,720
It could have been Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, but I'm pretty sure it was Spirited

1819
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,720
Away.

1820
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:23,360
I have to say for Alex's sake, he did fairly accurately describe this cartoon.

1821
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,360
Okay.

1822
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,360
All right.

1823
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:30,560
And then there is a woman who has, there's limited travel, you can only have meat on

1824
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:36,160
your birthday, her husband is hooked up to a machine at work, not in the way that maybe

1825
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:41,300
you might fantasize that being, but anyway, this is a video from a group called Forum

1826
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:42,300
for the Future.

1827
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:46,600
In 2011, they released a series of videos that sought to depict what the potential cities

1828
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:51,200
of the future could look like given trends that were existing then in the world.

1829
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:55,160
As is Alex's habit, he's found one that he thinks he can claim is prophetic and he's

1830
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:59,760
choosing to ignore the fact that there were four scenarios that this group depicted.

1831
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,320
The one Alex chose is closest to the things that he makes his audience scared of, with

1832
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:07,480
a strongly centralized government, food rationing, etc.

1833
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:13,880
This was a scenario titled Plandopolis, but there was also Communicity, Sprawlville, and

1834
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,480
Renewabod.

1835
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:19,600
These are each depictions of how city planning could evolve in a scenario where alternative

1836
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,800
energy sources were made primary and what life might look like depending on the strategies

1837
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,500
that are employed.

1838
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:30,440
None of this is meant to illustrate a plan, it's an exploration exercise, as the people

1839
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:33,640
who put this together actually said explicitly.

1840
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:38,440
Quote, Forum for the Future's scenarios are not predictions or depictions of desirable

1841
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:42,760
futures which we wish to promote, and they do not represent our vision of a sustainable

1842
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,760
future.

1843
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,180
They're pictures of different possible futures designed to help people understand the major

1844
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:49,220
trends that are shaping our world.

1845
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:53,280
They aim to challenge, inspire, and excite so that people feel motivated to plan for

1846
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,980
a better, more sustainable future.

1847
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:59,800
So again, I mean this is almost exactly the same thing as the lockstep, where he's taken

1848
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:05,520
that one plan, not plan, one scenario out of the four and decided, oh that's what they're

1849
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:06,520
going to do.

1850
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,120
They said they're going to do it!

1851
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:12,240
It's Operation Lockstep, oh my god, Plandopolis is the plan!

1852
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,000
Now I'm not going to talk about Renewabod.

1853
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,720
Well, don't worry about Renewabod.

1854
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:21,880
Although now, the moment you said Renewabod, I got transported into the writer's room with

1855
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:26,600
the whiteboard and the million different city name puns.

1856
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,720
And it's just, that's where I belong, Dan.

1857
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:33,360
Coming up with renewable names for different cities.

1858
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:36,600
Also, Renewabod is what I'm going to think when I'm doing sit-ups.

1859
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:40,480
Sure, sure, alright.

1860
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:45,460
So this is a bunch of nonsense, but I do think that it's probably going to be a very large

1861
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:50,320
piece of, it's probably going to be the next lockstep, the Plandopolis, and I think you'll

1862
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:54,840
probably hear a bit about it from other, but like, the thing that was really weird is when

1863
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:00,840
I was looking into this, there were like Reddit threads from 2012, 2015 about this, like this

1864
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:04,040
has made the rounds in conspiracy circles for a while.

1865
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:05,040
We've been here before.

1866
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,800
Yeah, this isn't new.

1867
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,120
So here's where things get weird.

1868
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,120
Okay.

1869
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,120
This is Alex's last show.

1870
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,120
He gets into bell-bottoms?

1871
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,120
No.

1872
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,120
Oh.

1873
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:15,120
It's his last show.

1874
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,120
Okay.

1875
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:20,800
As such, he wants you to know that the globalists, they believe that they're getting messages

1876
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:21,800
from aliens.

1877
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:22,800
Sure.

1878
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:23,800
We know this.

1879
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:24,800
Yeah.

1880
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:25,800
That's what they believe.

1881
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:26,800
They believe that.

1882
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:27,800
He doesn't believe that?

1883
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,060
Yes.

1884
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:30,060
He's not crazy?

1885
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:31,060
No.

1886
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:32,060
This is what they believe.

1887
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:33,060
Exactly.

1888
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:34,760
He's reporting on this as a scientist.

1889
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:35,760
Yes.

1890
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:36,920
Now wait till the end of this clip.

1891
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:37,920
Okay.

1892
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,120
I know the globalists follow this.

1893
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:46,400
They believe they're getting interdimensional information, just like in the movie, Buckle

1894
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,280
Ruban's Eye, a great B movie.

1895
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:55,160
They believe they're getting information over the ether to build this and they've been being

1896
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:57,200
sent the transmission forever.

1897
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:04,240
You can go back to the most ancient civilization 6,000 years ago in the Sanskrit and the hieroglyphs

1898
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:08,320
and they said, we are made up of a double helix of snakes.

1899
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:16,800
And you know, they say that creatures came from the dog star, Sirius, to tell them this.

1900
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,000
First of all, we talked about that whole thing in a Project Camelot episode.

1901
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Yes, we did.

1902
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
That's an issue.

1903
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Yeah.

1904
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
That's something he should think about.

1905
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,580
Second, if Alex believes that these aliens came down and told these, or these people

1906
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:32,320
did get this information that they couldn't possibly have from any other source, then

1907
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:36,560
that would imply that it isn't just what the globalists believe.

1908
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,560
Well.

1909
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:39,000
The globalists believe it because it's true.

1910
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,640
Well, hold on.

1911
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:47,240
And then they make the movie, you know, the new Alien movies all about it.

1912
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:50,040
They are telling you all of this, okay?

1913
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:58,040
And so they got a transmission, they built it, and it says, kill everybody and I'll give

1914
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,920
you the final codes.

1915
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,320
Now, you know Satan's a deceiver.

1916
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:05,240
Do you?

1917
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:10,080
And so obviously they're not going to be given, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates are not going to

1918
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,080
be given eternal life.

1919
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:17,080
They're so, they're like ham radio operators, you know, getting transmission from Japan

1920
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,080
or something.

1921
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:23,580
They're like excited, you know, and they've gotten this information and that's really

1922
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:25,460
what this is.

1923
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:30,600
Just like the Bible says, there is a fallen entity out of our sight, but another dimension

1924
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:37,840
that we have free will, that we're more advanced than, but we're in a embryonic stage, a larval

1925
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:43,760
stage, and if it can convince us to destroy ourselves, it will do it and take control

1926
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:48,360
and have us build its escape mechanism.

1927
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,920
And that's what this is.

1928
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,920
Okay.

1929
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:56,200
So the globalists believe that they're getting like promises from aliens who say you got

1930
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,860
to kill everybody and then we'll give you the final codes.

1931
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:02,700
And I'm, look, I know I sound crazy saying this, but that's just what they believe.

1932
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:08,460
Now I should tell you that they are getting these messages from a trans dimensional demon

1933
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:11,680
that's in the Bible and that's what's going on.

1934
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:12,680
Well that's obvious.

1935
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:13,680
Yeah.

1936
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:14,680
Okay.

1937
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:15,680
Yeah.

1938
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,640
That seems, I hate to be a dick.

1939
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:18,640
What about it?

1940
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,600
Seems kind of like a technicality.

1941
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:27,200
It does seem like what he's saying is, what he's saying is they believe, I'm not crazy,

1942
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:31,300
they believe that they're getting interdimensional messages.

1943
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,560
When we all know it's a demon.

1944
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:36,720
It's from the devil from a different dimension sending them messages.

1945
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:37,720
What don't they understand?

1946
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:38,720
Right.

1947
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,720
It's completely different.

1948
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:41,720
Now it might also be an alien.

1949
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:42,720
Sure.

1950
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:43,720
Ooh.

1951
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:44,720
Yeah.

1952
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:45,720
This is silly.

1953
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,320
And we all know Satan's a deceiver, Dan.

1954
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:48,320
We do.

1955
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,100
We all know Satan's a deceiver.

1956
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:52,680
That's taken as read.

1957
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:54,360
So okay.

1958
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:57,440
So let's entertain this for one second.

1959
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,760
Alright.

1960
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,780
Bezos, Gates.

1961
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:01,780
Not getting eternal life.

1962
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:07,400
Getting interdimensional messages that suggest to them that they will receive eternal life.

1963
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:08,400
Yes.

1964
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:12,880
Now is a real issue that they just haven't talked to Alex yet and had Alex be like, nah,

1965
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,760
nah, nah, nah, that's the devil.

1966
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,860
You're not actually going to get eternal life.

1967
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:18,280
They're lying to you.

1968
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:19,280
Hmm.

1969
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:20,680
Is that all we need?

1970
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:23,000
We just need to get Bezos and Alex in a room together?

1971
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
I think we do.

1972
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
I think we don't.

1973
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I think we should.

1974
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Nope.

1975
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,920
I think we should get him in a room together, put a big dome over it, and never open it

1976
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:31,920
again.

1977
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,840
So it turns out you can talk to aliens or the devil.

1978
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:35,840
Sure.

1979
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:36,840
In a lot of ways.

1980
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:37,840
Yeah.

1981
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:38,840
You could take drugs.

1982
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:39,840
Okay.

1983
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:40,840
You could electrocute yourself.

1984
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:41,840
Could just dream.

1985
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:44,160
Alex later says you could just like do that thing where you choke yourself for kind of

1986
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:45,160
a while.

1987
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:46,160
Oh yeah.

1988
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:47,160
I did that when I was young.

1989
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,160
Yep.

1990
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:51,560
So they're even getting everyone ready, okay?

1991
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:57,000
And so it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, and you can electrocute yourself.

1992
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,520
You can have your heart stopped and do it.

1993
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,000
You can take DMT and do it.

1994
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,200
Put the trailer back up, I'm telling you, to break to the other side.

1995
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:09,320
And boy, when they do it, do they break through.

1996
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:13,080
And in Buckaroo Banzai, the movie's telling you exactly what happens when he goes through

1997
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:16,480
the wall the other side, he don't come back the same dude.

1998
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,480
Yeah.

1999
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:21,240
So apparently, Buckaroo Banzai, predictive programming about how you could commune with

2000
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,320
the devil.

2001
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:28,760
You know, I knew it was always going to come down to Robocop in one of his many roles,

2002
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,440
but I didn't expect it to be Buckaroo Banzai.

2003
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,480
That was too happy and joyful a film!

2004
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:38,080
Well, turns out it also was full of very, very subtle messages about the devil.

2005
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,080
Oh.

2006
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:40,080
Well, that'll happen.

2007
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,080
Yep.

2008
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:45,520
Also, you remember that episode where Alex was incoherent, fucked up on something, and

2009
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,680
one of the questions from the Reddit AskManny thing was about Buckaroo Banzai, he's like,

2010
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:49,680
I've never seen it.

2011
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:50,680
Yeah.

2012
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,280
He was being cagey.

2013
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:57,800
He does not like revealing that he's a big nerd, which is so weird to me.

2014
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:59,920
Meanwhile, Buckaroo Banzai is real.

2015
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:04,720
Is this like a there but for the grace of God, could I have been Alex Jones if I was

2016
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:09,480
just so insecure about my nerdiness when I was in like fourth grade?

2017
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:10,480
No.

2018
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,480
Is that all it took?

2019
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:12,680
No, because I think you probably were.

2020
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:16,900
I think it would also require an inability to understand the things you were reading.

2021
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:17,900
There is that.

2022
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:21,920
That's such an essential piece of what makes Alex Alex.

2023
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:22,920
Yeah.

2024
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:23,920
Like a lack of reading comprehension.

2025
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,720
Just an inability to comprehend what you read.

2026
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:27,720
Yeah.

2027
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:33,880
Mixed with a pretty high-functioning memory, a recall, a pretty strong recall.

2028
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,120
Yeah, totally.

2029
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:38,120
But just not a good understanding.

2030
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,120
No.

2031
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:44,760
And, I mean, don't get me wrong, also being really insecure about being a nerd.

2032
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:45,760
Yeah, totally.

2033
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:46,760
There's definitely that.

2034
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:47,760
That as well.

2035
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,160
I'm not really a big Star Wars fan.

2036
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:50,400
Anyways, let me start my show.

2037
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:51,400
Bom, bom, bom.

2038
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,400
Neighbors.

2039
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:53,400
Sorry.

2040
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:54,400
Can't do the Imperial March.

2041
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:55,400
Sorry.

2042
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:56,400
Just as bad as yelling Nazis.

2043
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,840
I just screamed Nazis and now I'm playing the Imperial March.

2044
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:58,840
That's trouble.

2045
01:33:58,840 --> 01:33:59,840
Stop it.

2046
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:00,840
That's neighbor's trouble.

2047
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:04,680
So Alex has a plug here and this made me pretty sad.

2048
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:06,200
I didn't plug last hour.

2049
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:09,680
Speaking of last show, if I don't plug, we won't be here.

2050
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:11,360
I am spending all the money we've got.

2051
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:17,880
I have expended much of our reserves going to Georgia and going to Arizona and going

2052
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:19,000
to DC.

2053
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,700
What a series of great investments.

2054
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:30,080
Really got the achieved results out of Georgia, Arizona, DC, caravan.

2055
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,440
Really set the world on fire with that caravan.

2056
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,540
We're still hearing about it.

2057
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:38,320
The ripples of the caravan.

2058
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,920
The stop the steal caravan.

2059
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:43,840
I mean, it's changed the political landscape.

2060
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:50,680
I'm going to say, I think pretty seriously, this will be maybe one of the few times Dan

2061
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:58,000
where you have absolutely, like the caravanity project will live on forever.

2062
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,560
Long after the caravan has been forgotten.

2063
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:00,560
I don't believe that.

2064
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,560
I think you've done it.

2065
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:02,560
I think you've done it.

2066
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,560
You've immortalized something.

2067
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,520
I got a phone call.

2068
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:07,520
Right?

2069
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,520
Okay.

2070
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:13,960
Lieutenant Colonel, I can't say his name, but I promised I wouldn't.

2071
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:19,000
He was telling me that he talked to Gavin Newsom and people on the West coast, the high

2072
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:24,580
elites, the biggest figures in West coast politics.

2073
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:28,080
They're terrified that they're going to do another caravan.

2074
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,080
That's trouble.

2075
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:30,080
That's trouble.

2076
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,080
Head West.

2077
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:32,080
That is trouble.

2078
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,760
I can see Feinstein's bones jiggling.

2079
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:40,000
They're so afraid that Owen is going to draw crowds of tens of people.

2080
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:45,080
Not to the West!

2081
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:47,120
They'll get all the way to Nevada.

2082
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:51,600
I mean, look, I don't believe that this is necessarily going to be what happens, but

2083
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:57,380
I do think that there would be a certain cosmic hilarity if Alex ends up going broke because

2084
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:58,380
of this bad investment.

2085
01:35:58,380 --> 01:35:59,380
It'd be so great.

2086
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:00,380
It'd be so great.

2087
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:04,220
Look, we could have stayed on air another year, but I thought it was a good idea to

2088
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:07,440
send Owen to Baton Rouge.

2089
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,840
I want the armored car to take him down.

2090
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,840
I want that to be the thing.

2091
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,560
He's going to be living out of that armored car.

2092
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:17,880
That's such every bad boss that I've ever known.

2093
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:20,960
Hey, I know what it said that I got a bunker going.

2094
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,960
It's actually just this tank.

2095
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:25,080
I got a bunch of beans in the tank.

2096
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:31,200
Every bad boss I've ever known has been just like that where it's like, guys, unfortunately

2097
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:34,480
we're only going to be able to do a small raise this year.

2098
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:35,840
It's just going to be a 2%.

2099
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,200
Anyways, I bought an armored van!

2100
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:39,200
Weee!

2101
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,700
We're going to fucking Florida!

2102
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:43,440
Like fuck off.

2103
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,360
You guys are the worst.

2104
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,640
So Alex has a guest on, which I thought was weird.

2105
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,760
I was like, hey, it's your last show.

2106
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,120
Do your fucking last show.

2107
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:57,200
Don't have guests on unless it's Steve because he belongs on your last show.

2108
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,800
He has ruined your life.

2109
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,800
He deserves to be there at the end.

2110
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:06,280
He needs to be wearing a black robe over like behind him with a scythe.

2111
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:07,280
Yeah.

2112
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,280
Uh, no, it's not.

2113
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:09,280
It's not Steve.

2114
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,640
Dr. Patrick M. Byrne is on with us.

2115
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:13,840
I'm not going to go over his whole giant bio.

2116
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,360
He started a lot of big companies.

2117
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:18,560
Uh, I'm not going to again, list them all.

2118
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:23,600
He was the CEO of Overstock and started that or runs worldstock.com was the first major

2119
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,280
online site to accept Bitcoin.

2120
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:31,480
So yeah, this Patrick Byrne, he was the CEO of Overstock until he had to resign after

2121
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:36,120
it came out that he had an intimate relationship with Maria Butina, the Russian woman who pled

2122
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:39,800
guilty to conspiracy to act as a unregistered foreign agent.

2123
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:40,800
Yeah.

2124
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,800
And he had to resign because of that?

2125
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:45,960
Yeah, he was mixed up in some shit.

2126
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:49,240
After that, he had a bit of a public meltdown and said that the FBI forced him to have a

2127
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:54,040
relationship with her and he made a button and we had a string of nonsensical interviews.

2128
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,040
I like that swing.

2129
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,040
Yeah.

2130
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,040
That's what I like about Patrick Byrne.

2131
01:37:57,040 --> 01:38:02,640
Um, he's on just pushing the same sort of dominion conspiracies and also one thing that

2132
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:10,520
I find very interesting is that if he's to be believed, he's feeding information to Rudy

2133
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:13,140
Giuliani and Sidney Powell.

2134
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:17,080
So the information that they're putting out, he's taking credit for.

2135
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:18,080
Okay.

2136
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:24,760
So you're telling me that somebody who lost his insanely, perhaps obscenely high paying

2137
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:32,000
job, because of having an illicit affair with a foreign agent unregistered, is now telling

2138
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:38,820
me several years later, I'm feeding information to Rudy Giuliani, someone who never ever had

2139
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:41,560
any connection to any sort of Russian intelligence whatsoever.

2140
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:42,560
Correct?

2141
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:47,060
Well, here's the problem, like everyone's just full of shit and so I don't know if I

2142
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:48,060
believe that.

2143
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:49,520
Oh, I don't believe him at all.

2144
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,720
I'm just saying that that's a pattern of behavior.

2145
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:54,520
If true, not great.

2146
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:55,520
Cool.

2147
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,520
And it's not a good interview either.

2148
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:02,520
I don't really care because Alex has another guest on and maybe this is somebody who should

2149
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:06,280
be on his last show, but come the fuck on.

2150
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:11,960
Joining us for the next hour and 15 minutes ahead of Joel Skousen is the one, the only

2151
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:12,960
David Eich.

2152
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,640
The turd in the punch bowl himself.

2153
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:21,100
The guy who earlier on in his career, Alex would say is meant to make conspiracy thinkers

2154
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:25,840
and people who ask questions, give him a bad name, make them look bad because he talks

2155
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:31,920
about lizards and shape-shifting folks and blood drinking and oh wait, I'm that now.

2156
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:32,920
Yep.

2157
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:33,920
I...

2158
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:38,560
There's something actually kind of spiritually appropriate about the idea that on his last

2159
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:42,960
show he's sitting here and just like kissing David Eich's ass.

2160
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:43,960
Exactly!

2161
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:49,360
I would want more of like a reconciliation, like a behind the music reconciliation at

2162
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:53,160
the end, you know, where they're both sitting there like, you know, we disagreed about a

2163
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:58,200
lot of stuff, but now I can see I'm also full of shit too.

2164
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,600
I think that there's two things.

2165
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:10,040
One, I would like to see a bringing back of people like Jason Burmas and like Luke Rudowski.

2166
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:14,440
These people from way back when and just seeing how they get along now.

2167
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:15,440
Yeah, that'd be great.

2168
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:16,440
That would be a good last show.

2169
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:17,440
That'd be great.

2170
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:22,180
I also think that this is really good too because like Alex resented David Eich for

2171
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:23,180
a long time.

2172
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:24,180
Totally.

2173
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:25,180
Totally.

2174
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:29,760
David Eich did not give a single fuck and just did his thing and I'm not saying like

2175
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:30,760
that's a good thing.

2176
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:31,760
It's still a bad thing.

2177
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:32,760
No, it was terrible.

2178
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:35,800
But David Eich did his thing and didn't bend.

2179
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:36,800
He outlived him.

2180
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:37,800
Yeah.

2181
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:38,800
Yeah.

2182
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:43,080
And from the beginning to the end, I mean this isn't the last episode obviously, Alex

2183
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:44,080
had a show on Wednesday.

2184
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,080
Of course, of course.

2185
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,080
Of course.

2186
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:52,800
And to the hypothetical last show, David Eich stands as a more successful, more popular,

2187
01:40:52,800 --> 01:41:00,580
better situated figure in the conspiracy world than Alex could ever be and Alex has now been

2188
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:01,580
brought low.

2189
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:03,120
He has had to bend.

2190
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:04,120
That's brutal.

2191
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:07,080
He had to bend the knee to someone like David Eich.

2192
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:11,560
Ooh, here's my pitch on Alex's actual last episode.

2193
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:16,960
We actually, we full on do a, this is your life, right, where you have to hear the voice

2194
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:20,920
disembodied before you know who it is that's coming on there.

2195
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:26,720
I want to get so many different voices just to see how much he flinches, like hearing

2196
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:30,320
his former friend's voice just being like, oh shit, he's coming for me.

2197
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:31,320
What's happening?

2198
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:32,320
Oh God, he's behind me.

2199
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,320
Oh no.

2200
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,320
I want to hear it.

2201
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,320
Like, you know, those were always very positive.

2202
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:37,160
We're like, oh my God, it's him who's talking to me.

2203
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:38,360
This would be very dark.

2204
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:45,280
You know what'd be great is if Rapaport was a master of impressions and he could do like

2205
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:50,000
the voices of people who hate Alex now, like Webster Tarpley or something.

2206
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Sure, sure.

2207
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
And then he's like, oh no, Webster, is that you?

2208
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,760
Nope, it's just me, it's Rapaport, I'm fucking with you.

2209
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:56,160
It's still me, I'm in the bushes.

2210
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:57,160
Yeah.

2211
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:00,080
We're on voice number 15, Alex, you should assume by now it's me.

2212
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:04,620
Oh God, I love you, Rapaport, that you scared me, you had me scared there.

2213
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:05,620
Every time.

2214
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:10,240
Anyway, David Icke is here and basically what his big thing is, is, hey man, there's

2215
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:11,240
no COVID.

2216
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:12,240
Yeah, of course.

2217
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:15,360
I've said since March, there is no virus.

2218
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:20,840
And I've got more and more and more certain of that with every passing week.

2219
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:27,160
But even if you believe there is, on the basis of their, even their manipulated figures,

2220
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:35,480
which I say 100% manipulated, there is no deadly virus that affects the vast majority

2221
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:36,480
of people.

2222
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:37,480
The overwhelming vast majority of people.

2223
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:38,480
And yet...

2224
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:40,960
Let me stop you, we've got to go to break and I'll give you the floor, man, you're so

2225
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:41,960
on target.

2226
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:48,720
Okay, that's not the response you're supposed to have to David Icke coming on and saying

2227
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:54,120
that there is no virus, I've been convinced of this the whole time, but let's stipulate

2228
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:59,880
that there is, just in case some of your listeners aren't ready for the truth that there is no

2229
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:02,320
virus.

2230
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:07,640
That's fitting for the last show, for Alex to have a guest who's saying things that directly

2231
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:13,080
contradict literally everything that he believes, and him being like, you're so on target.

2232
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:15,100
You got it, nailed it, buddy.

2233
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:16,100
You're the best.

2234
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:21,420
We have one last clip here of David Icke from the final episode of the Alex Jones show.

2235
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:24,600
It's just, go fuck yourself, David Icke.

2236
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:29,720
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has never been isolated and shown to exist, simple, simple fact.

2237
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:35,900
There's no scientific paper on planet earth that's appeared since it's apparently started

2238
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:42,840
in China that has shown the virus to exist through isolating it and isolating its genetic

2239
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:43,840
code.

2240
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:47,600
This is absolutely not true, and David Icke should be absolutely ashamed of himself for

2241
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:48,960
passing along this bullshit.

2242
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,360
I bet he's not.

2243
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:54,780
There's an article in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases from June 2020 with the

2244
01:43:54,780 --> 01:44:00,960
title, quote, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from patient with coronavirus

2245
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,680
disease United States.

2246
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:08,920
I'll read you this from the abstract, quote, we isolated virus from nasopharyngeal and

2247
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:14,020
oropharyngeal specimens from the patient and characterized the viral sequence replication

2248
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:18,400
process and cell culture tropism.

2249
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:19,400
Isolated virus.

2250
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:20,400
Yeah.

2251
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,980
This paper actually even discusses how they were able to take this isolated virus and

2252
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:27,360
create a full genome sequence, which they made, quote, available to the domestic and

2253
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:31,520
international public health, academic and pharmaceutical sectors for basic research,

2254
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:35,360
diagnostic development, antiviral testing and vaccine development.

2255
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:39,200
David Icke actually goes on to bring up this study, which contradicts his point that there

2256
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:40,880
is no paper that shows this.

2257
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:41,880
Wild.

2258
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:45,000
It's not a problem for him though, because he then claims this paper is bogus, citing

2259
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:50,480
the expertise of a guy named Tom Cowen, who's put out a video about how 5G is poisoning

2260
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,600
our cells, which is creating viruses.

2261
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:53,600
Oh, great.

2262
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:58,560
Also, Cowen is a holistic medicine guy whose medical license is currently on probation

2263
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:03,320
because quote, among other things, he had offered an unlicensed drug to a breast cancer

2264
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:07,000
patient without informing her it wasn't approved for use.

2265
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,280
He also never saw the patient in person, nor did he review her full medical file, according

2266
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:16,700
to documents from the Medical Board of California detailing why he was to be disciplined.

2267
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:18,520
So I'm not going to listen to this dude.

2268
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:22,880
Anyway, go fuck yourself, David Icke, you're a real pile of shit, and it's fitting that

2269
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:26,300
Alex would have you as a guest on your last show.

2270
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:32,880
On a scale of one to five Hitler mustaches, two.

2271
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:33,880
Two mustaches?

2272
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:37,160
I think that's too, uh, probably, yeah, probably too low.

2273
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:41,760
I think a lot of, yeah, but one Hitler mustache is still one.

2274
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:42,760
Too many.

2275
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:45,720
I mean, it's really about how you look at the scale.

2276
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:50,120
You know, like, that's one of those things, there are limits.

2277
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:57,160
I don't see how saying on a show right now that the virus isn't real is any different

2278
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:59,320
from yelling fire in a crowded theater.

2279
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:00,320
Sure.

2280
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,320
You know?

2281
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:02,320
Like, that's just the reality of the situation.

2282
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:03,320
Yeah, yeah.

2283
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:05,880
There's no difference, you're killing people.

2284
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:08,800
Yeah.

2285
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:16,440
I agree with you, except for, I don't know, just the ability to make direct lines.

2286
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:21,440
If you yell fire in a crowded building, obviously you see the immediate effects of it, whereas

2287
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:29,320
this is so, it's much harder to trace direct people who were affected, and this is the

2288
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:31,640
reason that they behaved in the way they did.

2289
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:32,640
But I agree with you.

2290
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:34,320
You can't contract trace bullshit.

2291
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:37,400
I agree with you in concept, though.

2292
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:40,760
I don't know what the answer to that is.

2293
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:41,760
I hate it.

2294
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:42,760
I think it sucks.

2295
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:43,760
Murder hornets.

2296
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:44,760
Murder hornets?

2297
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:45,760
Yep.

2298
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:46,760
How about this?

2299
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:47,760
Okay.

2300
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:48,760
Daleks.

2301
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:50,920
I like it.

2302
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:53,200
What would we put in our Dalek compartments?

2303
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,200
Hornets.

2304
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:56,720
Okay, take this swab.

2305
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:58,440
Didn't take the swab?

2306
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:59,960
Release murder hornets.

2307
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:00,960
Yeah, exactly.

2308
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:06,440
It'd be so weird if it was just like, alright, take this swab.

2309
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:07,440
No I won't.

2310
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,440
Boop.

2311
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:09,440
What comes out?

2312
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,440
Cake.

2313
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:11,440
What?

2314
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:12,440
Folger.

2315
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:13,440
What the fuck?

2316
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,440
Thank you, Dalek.

2317
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:15,440
Ah, but the cake is a bomb.

2318
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:16,440
Shit.

2319
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:17,440
Damn it.

2320
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:18,440
Yeah, so I don't know.

2321
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:24,080
I gotta say, I admire Alex for doing his last show.

2322
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,000
He said he was going to do it.

2323
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Sure.

2324
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,440
I don't admire what he did, though.

2325
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:32,600
Again, I think we're running into this a lot.

2326
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,760
We could do this better than him.

2327
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:40,640
If you have this opportunity to do your last show, don't just do your show.

2328
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:46,200
Don't talk to Patrick Byrne about Dominion conspiracies that'll be stale tomorrow.

2329
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:52,080
Don't do an interview with David Icke where it just becomes transparently clear how much

2330
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:56,080
you've betrayed your own beliefs in your career.

2331
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:59,160
Do something that is like...

2332
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:00,160
Retrospect it.

2333
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:04,600
I honestly think just revisiting Endgame would have been amazing.

2334
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:05,600
Probably.

2335
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:06,600
That would have been amazing.

2336
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:07,600
That really would have.

2337
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,320
He would have been so confused by some of the theories that he had.

2338
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:10,880
He wouldn't remember half of it.

2339
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,880
That would have been great.

2340
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:13,160
And you know he wouldn't have prepared.

2341
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,160
No.

2342
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:15,720
He would think that he knew everything about his film.

2343
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:16,720
Totally.

2344
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:19,320
And then he'd realize he has no idea what he was making that movie about.

2345
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:21,760
Back in the booth, pull up the bibliography on this.

2346
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:22,760
What?

2347
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:23,760
Fill in later?

2348
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,480
Why didn't people fill this in?

2349
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:26,480
What the fuck?

2350
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:27,880
Can you even do that?

2351
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:28,880
Wait a second.

2352
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:30,360
I can't pull up this Encarta page.

2353
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:32,040
What the fuck is going on?

2354
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:34,320
Somebody get that Encarta disc from way back in my house.

2355
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,720
Or maybe this bibliography sucks.

2356
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:36,720
Oh wait it was me.

2357
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:37,720
Oh shit.

2358
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:38,720
Yeah.

2359
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:44,600
I would be interested in something like that or even blowin' hard for a couple hours just

2360
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:49,640
about like the Northern Lights.

2361
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:56,120
Yeah, yeah, full on three hours of esoteric Alex tossing out all kinds of theories about

2362
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:57,120
all kinds of shit.

2363
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:00,520
It needs to be something that can live as a document.

2364
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:05,680
You know, if you're doing this and it's something you clearly have talked about doing as an

2365
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:11,540
idea for a long time and you say the day before, I'm finally going to do this thing, this last

2366
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:16,040
episode, this hypothetical last episode, it's gotta be a concept episode.

2367
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:17,040
And it just wasn't.

2368
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,040
No.

2369
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:19,040
It just wasn't.

2370
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:20,040
It was flat.

2371
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:21,040
The guests were terrible.

2372
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:23,120
This stuff's embarrassing.

2373
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:30,160
If it's to be remembered as his last episode, he's getting shit wrong all over the place.

2374
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:32,920
His big message is the left are chumps.

2375
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:33,920
Sure.

2376
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:34,920
Great.

2377
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:35,920
Great.

2378
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:39,840
He's talking about how if you go to a hospital for COVID, Antifa will murder you in their

2379
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,040
murder docs.

2380
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:42,440
That's going to stand the test of time.

2381
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:48,960
He's rambling about plannedopolis, which is already, again, it's a conspiracy that's stale

2382
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:50,920
almost as soon as it comes out of his mouth.

2383
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:51,920
It's pointless.

2384
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:53,920
Oh, the obvious thing that his last show should be.

2385
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,160
What's that?

2386
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:57,480
Just a movie roundup.

2387
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:01,700
All the movies that he has based all of his bullshit on.

2388
01:50:01,700 --> 01:50:04,040
He just starts playing clips, man.

2389
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:08,440
He does a full on clip show of like, hey, you remember this conspiracy theory?

2390
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:09,440
This one's from Oblivion.

2391
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:10,440
All right.

2392
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:11,440
All right.

2393
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:12,440
Now let's move on to this next one.

2394
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:13,440
Hey, you remember this one?

2395
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:14,440
Logan's Run.

2396
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:15,440
You guys ever see that?

2397
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:16,440
That's a classic.

2398
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:17,680
But he does do that as he does it.

2399
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:19,280
I mean, you heard about the Buckaroo Banzai.

2400
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:20,280
Sure.

2401
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:21,280
Sure.

2402
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:22,280
Totally.

2403
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:23,280
But I'm talking about comprehensive.

2404
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:24,280
Do the whole filmography.

2405
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:25,840
Turn it into AMC.

2406
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:31,960
Also, let me just say, dangerous message to send on your show that you can talk to demons

2407
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:35,760
or aliens if you electrocute yourself, because what if somebody listening wants to talk to

2408
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:36,760
those aliens?

2409
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:37,760
Well, that's true.

2410
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:39,160
What if people listening end up electrocuting themselves?

2411
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:42,760
It never occurred to me that I should try any of those things.

2412
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:43,760
Well, now.

2413
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:46,120
But now I obviously need to.

2414
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:47,320
Yeah.

2415
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:49,560
I give this two thumbs down.

2416
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:54,400
Again, like the caravan, it's just another thing that gets me so fucking excited.

2417
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:55,400
I know.

2418
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:56,400
It's such a bust.

2419
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,400
I know.

2420
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:58,400
It's such a letdown.

2421
01:50:58,400 --> 01:50:59,400
I know.

2422
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:08,600
Alex cannot help but be disappointing, but I should say I'm back to where I like to be,

2423
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:11,120
which is I'm ready to be disappointed consistently.

2424
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:12,120
Sure.

2425
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:13,120
Sure.

2426
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:16,640
There was a stretch where I was very much just like, it's getting tiresome that I'm

2427
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:18,600
being disappointed over and over again.

2428
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:19,600
Yeah.

2429
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:24,200
Now there's a bit more charm to it.

2430
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:27,400
I can't help but think that it's all just because I'm building things up again.

2431
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:35,640
I have a theory that some of that is about your excitement is both yours and also anticipation

2432
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:38,240
of the excitement of you telling it to me.

2433
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:43,080
Because even now I can see it in your eyes when you were getting excited about the feeling

2434
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:46,240
you had whenever he was like, I'm going to do my last show tomorrow.

2435
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:49,560
I saw it in your eyes in the moment.

2436
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:53,920
Well, mostly because you immediately could tell that that was-

2437
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:54,920
Oh, well, yeah.

2438
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:55,920
Obviously.

2439
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:56,920
What I was excited about.

2440
01:51:56,920 --> 01:52:02,160
I feel like, yeah, there's some anticipation to that, sure.

2441
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:03,160
You know?

2442
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:04,160
Yeah.

2443
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:05,160
Daleks with guns.

2444
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:06,160
Still good.

2445
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:09,840
Anyway, I mean, I guess our show is over too now.

2446
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,480
Alex has done his last show.

2447
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:16,800
You think those cops would begin to view the Dalek as a partner, you know?

2448
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:23,120
If I understand anything from globalist texts, and by that I mean short circuit-

2449
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:24,120
Sure.

2450
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:25,120
Yes.

2451
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:26,120
Okay.

2452
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:27,120
Yeah.

2453
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:28,120
Yeah.

2454
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:29,120
For sure.

2455
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:32,240
And there's also a lot of blatant racism in that too.

2456
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:33,240
WALL-E.

2457
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:35,360
Globalist document WALL-E.

2458
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:36,360
Sure.

2459
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:37,360
Sure.

2460
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:38,360
Yeah, I don't know.

2461
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:40,960
Anyway, we'll be back because our show isn't over and neither is Alex's.

2462
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,960
Of course not.

2463
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:45,680
This is all just dumb bullshit on his part trying to get attention, but he had to do

2464
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:46,680
it eventually.

2465
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:47,680
You know what I'd love?

2466
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:48,680
What?

2467
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:54,120
I'd love to do it on Wednesday because holiday and such, but I would love if today's show

2468
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:55,120
on Wednesday.

2469
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:57,640
I do know that he did one, but I haven't listened to it.

2470
01:52:57,640 --> 01:53:03,240
I would love if it started, yesterday I tried to do my last episode, I really fucking punted.

2471
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:04,240
I screwed up.

2472
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:07,360
I'm going to do my real last episode today.

2473
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:08,360
That would be great.

2474
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:10,840
I would give anything for him to do a whole week of that.

2475
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:11,840
Yeah.

2476
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:12,840
Each time just being like, fucked up.

2477
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:15,920
Each time, look, last time I thought I did better, but you know what?

2478
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:16,920
Third time's the charm.

2479
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:20,400
I realized in hindsight it was embarrassing to have David Icahn for an hour and then kiss

2480
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:25,320
his ass on the last show and I should, by all accounts, think he's a total weirdo.

2481
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:26,320
Yeah.

2482
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:28,360
Hey, we're going to do this again.

2483
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:31,360
Also, Steve China complained that he didn't get booked.

2484
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:32,360
Yeah.

2485
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:36,840
Like an aspiring comic, he got mad that he didn't get the call.

2486
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:39,220
So we're going to do it from the top.

2487
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:40,720
It is fitting if this is his last episode.

2488
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:43,440
Also, boy, Rob Dues got to feel bad that he wasn't on the last show.

2489
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:45,560
Yeah, Rob Dues doesn't need to be on the last show.

2490
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:46,560
You got to.

2491
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:47,560
Yeah, come on.

2492
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:48,560
He's been there forever.

2493
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:49,560
Ah, come on.

2494
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:50,560
Yeah.

2495
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:51,560
Anyway, we'll be back.

2496
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:52,560
Indeed, we will.

2497
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:53,560
But until then, we have a website.

2498
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:54,560
We do have a website.

2499
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:55,560
It's knowledgefight.com.

2500
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:56,560
Yep.

2501
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:57,560
We're also on Twitter.

2502
01:53:57,560 --> 01:53:58,560
We are on Twitter.

2503
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,920
It's at knowledge underscore fight and at go to bed Jordan.

2504
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:01,920
We're also on Facebook.

2505
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:02,920
We are on Facebook.

2506
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:06,480
If you'd like to tell us your iTunes, if you could, please find a local charity or bail

2507
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:09,640
fund in your area to help out people doing God's work right now.

2508
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:10,680
We will be back.

2509
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:14,760
But until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX Clark, I'm Daryl Rundis.

2510
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:17,720
I am a surf, not a Smurf.

2511
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:18,720
Andy in Kansas.

2512
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:19,720
You're on the air.

2513
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:20,720
Thanks for holding.

2514
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:21,720
Hello, Alex.

2515
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:22,720
I'm a first time caller.

2516
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:23,720
I'm a huge fan.

2517
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:24,720
I love your work.

2518
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:51,680
I love you.
