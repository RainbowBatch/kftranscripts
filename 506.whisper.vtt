N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:19.600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.480
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.920
I have great respect for knowledgefight.

00:23.920 --> 00:24.920
Knowledgefight.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.360
Knowledgefight.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.360
I'm sick of them posing as if they are the good guys.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.360
Knowledgefight.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.360
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.360
Need, I need money.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.360
Stop it.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.360
Andy in Kansas.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.360
Andy in Kansas.

00:37.360 --> 00:38.360
It's time to pray.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.360
Andy in Kansas.

00:39.360 --> 00:40.360
You're on the air, thanks for holding us.

00:40.360 --> 00:41.360
Hello, Alex I'm a freshman color, I'm a huge fan.

00:41.360 --> 01:01.280
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.280
I'm Jordan.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.880
We're a couple dudes, let's sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about

01:04.880 --> 01:05.880
Alex Jones.

01:05.880 --> 01:06.880
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

01:06.880 --> 01:07.880
Jordan.

01:07.880 --> 01:08.880
Dan.

01:08.880 --> 01:09.880
Jordan.

01:09.880 --> 01:10.880
Quick question for ya.

01:10.880 --> 01:15.560
My question is, things that have been sent our way from the great areas of the world

01:15.560 --> 01:16.560
that are not America.

01:16.560 --> 01:17.560
Yes.

01:17.560 --> 01:18.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18.560 --> 01:23.080
I got a nice package, yep, in the mailbag from Lee over in the UK.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.760
Uh, oh my god.

01:24.760 --> 01:25.760
What?

01:25.760 --> 01:26.760
So much candy.

01:26.760 --> 01:27.760
Oh shit.

01:27.760 --> 01:28.760
I ate it all already.

01:28.760 --> 01:29.760
Of course you did.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.760
I was gonna say, anytime you say so much candy, I'm like, I didn't see a god damn dime, what

01:32.760 --> 01:34.000
fucking, I didn't see any of this candy.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.220
I saved you some wine gums.

01:37.220 --> 01:41.840
Because I tried the last ones that came in another package from someone overseas, and

01:41.840 --> 01:42.840
they were so terrible.

01:42.840 --> 01:43.840
They're disgusting.

01:43.840 --> 01:50.440
Your form of sharing candy is literally like, I picked out all the jelly beans I don't like

01:50.440 --> 01:51.440
and I gave them to you.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.440
Sure, you can have all the licorice ones.

01:52.440 --> 01:53.440
Yeah, exactly.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.440
Well the problem-

01:54.440 --> 01:55.440
This one's popcorn.

01:55.440 --> 01:59.740
The problem, as I see it Jordan, is that I go pick up the mail, and if there's candy

01:59.740 --> 02:02.480
in it, you're not here when I open it up.

02:02.480 --> 02:05.320
The clock starts when you open the candy.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.680
I have to eat it.

02:06.680 --> 02:12.560
Yeah, if it's like a three day window between you and me getting together, that's 72 hours,

02:12.560 --> 02:14.280
I'm not gonna survive that candy length.

02:14.280 --> 02:19.600
And I'm ready to, I'm really close to ready to say that the UK might have some of the

02:19.600 --> 02:24.320
best chocolates and candies of the things that have been sent, for sure.

02:24.320 --> 02:30.480
Canada's pretty strong too, but in terms of the ones that I've had, I think I gotta move

02:30.480 --> 02:31.480
to London.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.480
Just for the candy.

02:32.480 --> 02:33.900
Oh well, America's chocolate is shit.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.200
They're allowed to do different shit to American chocolate.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.200
I'm not that guy.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.080
I still think that we have some good chocolate options here.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.640
We have very good chocolate options.

02:41.640 --> 02:45.920
But man, some of these, oh god, just a crunchy, so good.

02:45.920 --> 02:46.920
See, nothing will beat the-

02:46.920 --> 02:47.920
Honey, home.

02:47.920 --> 02:50.240
Nothing will ever beat the Reese's Peanut Butter Egg.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.400
It's simply impossible to defeat.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.440
It's a good ratio.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.440
It's perfect.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.440
Yep.

02:54.440 --> 02:59.000
So, we got that, and I'm sorry that I ate all the candy, but it is what it is.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
It's fine.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
I saved, like I said-

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
I've had enough candy in my life.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.440
Wine gums for you and your partner.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.440
Enjoy.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.440
Thank you.

03:06.440 --> 03:14.920
Also, got this nice package from Employmentless Eddy and Government Goat, G-A-U-T-E, out in

03:14.920 --> 03:18.760
Norway, out in the Socialist Democratic Monarchy of Norway.

03:18.760 --> 03:19.760
Love it.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.400
Got you a couple novelty beverages.

03:21.400 --> 03:25.240
Yes, currently drinking a Nordic raspberry hard seltzer.

03:25.240 --> 03:29.500
This is a Beck, it means stream in Norwegian, apparently.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.720
It's very, very good.

03:30.720 --> 03:34.720
It's from Ager Brewery, or whatever, what's that letter that's an A and an E that are

03:34.720 --> 03:35.720
connected to each other?

03:35.720 --> 03:36.720
Do you know that?

03:36.720 --> 03:37.720
E.

03:37.720 --> 03:38.720
You know that letter?

03:38.720 --> 03:39.720
Yeah, it's E.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.720
Okay.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.720
It sounds like this.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.720
E.

03:42.720 --> 03:43.720
Okay.

03:43.720 --> 03:44.720
Eger Brewery, then.

03:44.720 --> 03:45.720
I got a couple also of non-alcoholic seltzers.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.160
I have not had a chance to dip into those.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.320
And then some chocolates.

03:50.320 --> 03:51.440
I have not eaten those yet.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.440
You can have a couple of those.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.120
Okay, I'll try a couple of those.

03:54.120 --> 03:58.120
And you know, what's that bugle?

03:58.120 --> 03:59.120
You know the bugles?

03:59.120 --> 04:00.120
The corn?

04:00.120 --> 04:01.120
The chip?

04:01.120 --> 04:02.560
Yeah, that you put on your fingers so it'll look like a witch?

04:02.560 --> 04:03.560
Yes.

04:03.560 --> 04:04.560
That's the one.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.560
That's the bag of those covered in chocolate.

04:05.560 --> 04:06.560
What?

04:06.560 --> 04:07.560
You can cover those in chocolate?

04:07.560 --> 04:08.560
Apparently they do that in Norway.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.560
I don't know if they can do that.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.560
Because they're fucking weird.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.360
I think that might be against the law here.

04:13.360 --> 04:17.520
So I'm going to read here from this note from Oslo.

04:17.520 --> 04:21.640
So with every bite you get a chunk of social democracy, socialized healthcare, a function

04:21.640 --> 04:25.940
in government, and or a secular society of fairly decent looking folks who spend their

04:25.940 --> 04:30.280
days eating babies, worshiping Satan, and committing heinous atrocities against culinary

04:30.280 --> 04:32.400
science through their national dishes.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.400
All right.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.680
That is maybe accurate based on the fact that it's chocolate covered bugles.

04:36.680 --> 04:37.680
That does sound right.

04:37.680 --> 04:41.420
Anyway, I have not tried those yet, but I'm sure they're going to be great, and thank

04:41.420 --> 04:43.760
you to all our international wonks.

04:43.760 --> 04:44.760
That sounds delicious.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.200
What's your bright spot, Jordan?

04:46.200 --> 04:53.280
I don't really have a bright spot so much as maybe a silver lining.

04:53.280 --> 04:57.880
As you know, my aunt died earlier this year.

04:57.880 --> 05:01.400
She did the old mortal coil shuffle.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.400
Sure.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.400
If you recall.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.400
That's what they call it.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.680
Recorded by Fridge Perry and Walter Payton.

05:06.680 --> 05:07.680
Okay.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.480
I know the joke you're making, the super bowl shuffle, right?

05:10.480 --> 05:11.480
Yeah.

05:11.480 --> 05:12.480
Yeah.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.480
So yeah.

05:13.480 --> 05:18.320
So T-Day, as I call it, was always her holiday.

05:18.320 --> 05:26.720
Like she co-signed when I went to college the first time of my many jaunts.

05:26.720 --> 05:32.480
My parents had terrible credit at the time, and she co-signed on my first student loan.

05:32.480 --> 05:38.000
And literally at that time she was like, and you're never going to miss T-Day ever again,

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
are you?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Ooh.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Yeah.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.240
So she was a blackmail artist.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.240
No, it was kind of a joke.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.240
She was an extortionist.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.240
It was kind of a joke.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.800
You know, that kind of thing.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.800
But at the same time it was also deadly serious.

05:48.800 --> 05:55.720
You repaid the interest on this loan with the drawings of your hand as a turkey.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.600
Exactly.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.600
So yeah.

05:58.600 --> 06:02.000
So this is a rough, this is the first one without her.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.280
So it's a little bit rough, but I was reflecting on it.

06:06.280 --> 06:11.440
And I think my silver lining is that I have no regrets.

06:11.440 --> 06:12.440
You know?

06:12.440 --> 06:13.440
That's good.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.660
There are a lot of situations where you can lose a loved one and you'll regret something

06:16.660 --> 06:19.760
like I wish I had done this before and all that stuff.

06:19.760 --> 06:23.160
And I have no regrets whatsoever.

06:23.160 --> 06:30.360
And I just had a solid relationship and I am terribly sad that it's over, but a lot

06:30.360 --> 06:35.040
of people don't get that luxury of like, everything went how it was going to go.

06:35.040 --> 06:39.080
I mean, hey, look, it's a bummer that you're talking about a loved one who's no longer

06:39.080 --> 06:43.080
here, but it's a pretty amazing thing to be able to feel that way.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.080
Yeah.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.080
Isn't it?

06:45.080 --> 06:46.080
Yeah.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.080
It really is.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.800
That's about as uplifting as you can get when you're talking about someone.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.800
It really is.

06:49.800 --> 06:56.200
And what's worse is because I didn't get the chance to say goodbye, the night I was going

06:56.200 --> 07:01.240
to go see her and do that whole stuff, she died.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.920
But I was even thinking about that.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.900
I was like, is that a regret that I didn't get to say goodbye?

07:05.900 --> 07:12.080
And then I was remembering when my grandfather died, her dad, we were at the nursing home

07:12.080 --> 07:13.360
as just watching him.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.940
It took him like a year to die.

07:14.940 --> 07:18.320
And she literally turned to me and she's like, I would rather die than let people see me

07:18.320 --> 07:20.200
like this.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.880
That's how she fucking went out, man.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.440
She died before anybody had the chance to see her like that.

07:25.440 --> 07:26.440
Skipping out the door.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.760
She was like, I'm not dealing with you fuckers.

07:28.760 --> 07:29.760
Good on her.

07:29.760 --> 07:30.760
And out she went.

07:30.760 --> 07:31.760
She got her wish.

07:31.760 --> 07:32.760
Lived the way she died.

07:32.760 --> 07:33.760
Indeed.

07:33.760 --> 07:34.760
Yeah.

07:34.760 --> 07:35.760
Well, that's great.

07:35.760 --> 07:36.760
Yeah.

07:36.760 --> 07:37.760
Yeah.

07:37.760 --> 07:38.760
It's silver lining.

07:38.760 --> 07:39.760
Happy Thanksgiving to you, Jordan.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.760
Yeah.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.760
It's weird.

07:41.760 --> 07:42.760
I mean, I know we're not supposed to celebrate Thanksgiving.

07:42.760 --> 07:46.840
I mean, not that, but you know, the tradition of Thanksgiving and a lot of the imagery

07:46.840 --> 07:50.360
around it is based on a sort of colonialist myth and all this.

07:50.360 --> 07:55.000
I think there's a lot of people who have a lot of fair complaints about the holiday,

07:55.000 --> 07:59.640
but at the end of the day, ultimately what it is about is, if you want it to be, is about

07:59.640 --> 08:01.680
being grateful for things.

08:01.680 --> 08:07.200
I think that certainly if we take the time to reflect, we have a lot to be grateful for.

08:07.200 --> 08:13.680
And not just these fond memories of loved ones or weird things you can eat or drink

08:13.680 --> 08:15.960
from overseas.

08:15.960 --> 08:16.960
It's just great.

08:16.960 --> 08:17.960
It's just great.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.920
And I feel very wonderful being able to reflect on those things.

08:20.920 --> 08:26.640
So thank you everybody who has made so many things for us to be grateful for.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.640
Yes.

08:27.640 --> 08:28.640
Yes.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.640
We are very, very grateful for many, many things.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.040
One person I am not grateful to.

08:32.040 --> 08:33.040
Who's that?

08:33.040 --> 08:34.160
Alexander Emmerich Jones.

08:34.160 --> 08:35.160
That motherfucker.

08:35.160 --> 08:36.160
Running things again.

08:36.160 --> 08:37.160
Yeah.

08:37.160 --> 08:38.280
So Jordan, today we're going to be talking about him.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.280
I know that's a shock.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.280
We're going to be talking-

08:40.280 --> 08:41.280
That's another character for us.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.720
We're going to be talking about November 22nd to 24th, 2020.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.720
I'm Dan.

08:45.720 --> 08:46.720
Hello.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.720
Hooray!

08:47.720 --> 08:48.720
Yay!

08:48.720 --> 08:52.000
I'm slowly moving back away from that.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.960
I'm going to start saying god damn it again.

08:53.960 --> 08:57.280
I'm no longer accepting this.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.280
I gave it a shot.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.280
Brought it back and forth.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.280
Yeah, sorry.

09:00.280 --> 09:05.040
There's a, we're recording this a little later than we normally do.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.520
We had to push back recording.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.840
And there's a very specific reason.

09:08.840 --> 09:12.000
And I think that you will immediately know what it is.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.160
And I would like for you to yell bingo.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.160
Not yell.

09:15.160 --> 09:16.160
I understand.

09:16.160 --> 09:17.160
We are recording a little later.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.160
Sure, sure, sure.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.160
Neighbors and all that.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.160
I understand.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.160
But I would like for you to say bingo.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.160
Okay.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.880
Whenever you think you have discovered why we had to record later.

09:24.880 --> 09:25.880
Okay.

09:25.880 --> 09:26.880
Alright.

09:26.880 --> 09:27.880
Okay.

09:27.880 --> 09:28.880
So we'll get down to business on this episode.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.360
But before we do, let's take a little moment to say thank you to some folks who have signed

09:31.360 --> 09:32.360
up on our sporting show.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.360
That's a great idea.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.080
So first, Nicholas C. Thank you so much.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.560
You are now a policy wonk.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.840
I'm a policy wonk.

09:37.840 --> 09:38.840
Thanks Nicholas!

09:38.840 --> 09:39.840
Thank you.

09:39.840 --> 09:40.840

09:42.840 --> 09:43.840

09:48.840 --> 09:49.840

09:50.840 --> 09:51.840
Thank you.

09:51.840 --> 09:52.840
Next, Dan the Bold.

09:52.840 --> 09:53.840

09:53.840 --> 09:54.840

09:54.840 --> 09:55.840
I'm a policy wonk.

09:55.840 --> 09:56.840
Thank you very much.

09:56.840 --> 09:57.840
Dan the Bold.

09:57.840 --> 09:58.840
Great Name.

09:58.840 --> 09:59.840
Yeah.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.840
Next, Dodd Snow.

10:00.840 --> 10:01.840

10:01.840 --> 10:02.840
You are now a policy wonk.

10:02.840 --> 10:03.840
I'm a policy wonk.

10:03.840 --> 10:04.840
Thanks Dodd.

10:04.840 --> 10:05.840
Thank you.

10:05.840 --> 10:06.840
Next Moose Work.

10:06.840 --> 10:07.840
Thank you so much.

10:07.840 --> 10:08.840
You are now Dan and Jordan.

10:08.840 --> 10:09.840
I love you.

10:09.840 --> 10:10.840
I'm a policy wonk.

10:10.840 --> 10:11.840
I'm a policy wonk.

10:11.840 --> 10:12.840
You are now a policy wonk.

10:12.840 --> 10:13.840
Thank you very much to all of whatever that was.

10:13.840 --> 10:18.240
Finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple folks who donated on an elevated level, we appreciate that very much.

10:18.240 --> 10:21.440
So first, Ugly Derek, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

10:21.440 --> 10:25.240
And, Blavid Dane, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

10:25.640 --> 10:26.840
I'm a policy wonk.

10:26.840 --> 10:29.840
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.440
How's your 401k doing, bro?

10:31.440 --> 10:34.040
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

10:34.040 --> 10:35.440
Let's just get down to business.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.240
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.040
Why are you pimps so good?

10:39.040 --> 10:41.040
My neck is freakishly large.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.840
I declare info war on you.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.440
Thank you so much, Ugly Derek, and thank you so much, Blavid Dane.

10:46.440 --> 10:48.040
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

10:48.040 --> 10:55.040
If you're out there listening and thinking, hey, I enjoyed the show, I'd like to support what these gents are doing, you can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com, clicking the button that says support the show, or...

10:55.040 --> 11:02.840
Ah, Dan, it's Tea Day, you know what kind of thing you need to do on Tea Day, be generous and care for the people around you.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.040
You need to get, uh...

11:04.040 --> 11:05.840
And go to a local charity or bail fund.

11:05.840 --> 11:06.440
Oh, okay.

11:06.440 --> 11:07.440
Yeah, that would be my plan.

11:07.440 --> 11:14.040
I was going to start reciting the lyrics to All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight, because this is a football holiday, my friend.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.840
Mmm, not really a football guy anymore.

11:15.840 --> 11:16.240
No?

11:16.240 --> 11:18.240
Actually, not a football guy at all anymore.

11:18.240 --> 11:18.840
No.

11:18.840 --> 11:22.040
Four years, cold, cold turkey.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.040
Okay, cold turkey, not good for Thanksgiving.

11:24.040 --> 11:27.040
Not good for Thanksgiving, yeah, there we go.

11:27.040 --> 11:35.040
Alright, so Jordan, before we get into this, we have a couple of out of context drops, and which would you like to go for?

11:35.040 --> 11:35.840
Bingo!

11:35.840 --> 11:39.240
Okay. Incorrect.

11:39.240 --> 11:39.640
Okay.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.440
Um, I'll just start with this one.

11:41.440 --> 11:47.840
Surf means slave. Not a smurf, a surf.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.640
Yep.

11:48.640 --> 11:49.240
Alright.

11:49.240 --> 11:49.840
Pretty good.

11:49.840 --> 11:50.640
Okay, that's not bad.

11:50.640 --> 11:51.240
Not bad.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.240
That's good analysis.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.240
Yep. That was apropos of nothing.

11:55.240 --> 11:56.240
Sure, sure.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.040
Just thinking of people who get confused that he was talking about the smurfs.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.040
You gotta make sure.

12:00.040 --> 12:11.640
Now, this is actually very exciting, this next out of context drop had no place in the episode, but it's very exciting, because it's something that I hope so badly that Alex continues, but I don't think he will.

12:11.640 --> 12:12.640
Alright.

12:12.640 --> 12:20.240
On a scale of one to five, you get five Hitler Mustaches. Wish you have a new thing there. You get five Hitler Mustaches.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.240
I would love it.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.240
I don't mind that. I don't mind that as a ranking system.

12:24.240 --> 12:29.240
If you took the globalists and you rated them on a scale of one to five Hitler Mustaches.

12:29.240 --> 12:33.240
I gotta be honest, I think if you're on the scale at all, it's bad.

12:33.240 --> 12:33.840
It's not great.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.840
I think Hitler only had one Hitler Mustache.

12:35.840 --> 12:36.840
You, sir, had three Hitler Mustaches.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.840
If you've got five Hitler Mustaches, that's way too many.

12:39.840 --> 12:40.840
That is.

12:40.840 --> 12:51.840
So, we started on Sunday, that's November 22nd, and Alex is still banging the gong of the voter fraud, and he has some very powerful people who are on his side.

12:51.840 --> 13:05.840
Ladies and gentlemen, the head of the Federal Elections Commission has gone public and said there was massive fraud orchestrated across the country against President Trump and against the American people.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.840
That is coming up.

13:08.840 --> 13:14.840
The current head of the Federal Election Commission is a fellow by the name of James Trainor, and he's a bit of a kook.

13:14.840 --> 13:21.840
Prior to his appointment, he had served as a counsel for Trump's 2016 campaign, and in his nomination hearing, he quote,

13:21.840 --> 13:27.840
would not commit to a blanket recusal from matters involving the president if he's confirmed to the Federal Election Commission.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.840
I imagine prior to that he was a used car salesman?

13:30.840 --> 13:36.840
Pretty cool stuff, and you gotta admire a guy who says in their job interview they're straight up not gonna commit to doing their job.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.840
Excuse me, what's the Constitution? No.

13:38.840 --> 13:47.840
He was confirmed in May of this year after his nomination stalled in Congress for a few years, and he got in with a 49 to 43 vote on strict party lines.

13:47.840 --> 13:57.840
James Trainor is not a great dude. He made headlines earlier this year when he did an interview with Church Militant where he compared the 2020 election to quote, spiritual warfare.

13:57.840 --> 14:07.840
He also claimed that religious leaders who were tax-exempt should feel free to tell their congregants who to vote for since Trump released an executive order indicating that he wasn't interested in enforcing the Johnson Amendment.

14:07.840 --> 14:16.840
Trainor said quote, the bishops are using their nonprofit status as a shield to hide behind from having to make a decision about who to support, and to come out publicly.

14:16.840 --> 14:24.840
Bishops say we should have an informed conscience when we go vote, but they never really take that next step and say here's who meets the criteria.

14:24.840 --> 14:25.840
Oh boy.

14:25.840 --> 14:30.840
In that interview he also made clear that he believes that the separation of church and state is a quote, fallacy.

14:30.840 --> 14:31.840
Sure.

14:31.840 --> 14:42.840
He elaborated quote, it was John Adams that said the Constitution presupposes a Christian moral people, which means you have to have that underlying principle in order for the Constitution to function and work properly.

14:42.840 --> 14:49.840
What we see going on around the world is complete anarchy in places where the rule of law has been completely abrogated.

14:49.840 --> 14:54.840
So it is a spiritual war that is striking at the underlying foundations of our constitutional republic.

14:54.840 --> 15:00.840
It's getting rid of the Christian moral principles that are the basis of the foundation of the country.

15:00.840 --> 15:09.840
One important thing to point out is that John Adams in his 1798 letter said that quote, our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.840
It's wholly inadequate to the government of any other.

15:12.840 --> 15:15.840
It's James Trainor who's adding the word Christian.

15:15.840 --> 15:16.840
Wow.

15:16.840 --> 15:25.840
John Adams wasn't saying that the Constitution was only for Christians, he just had a philosophy that morality itself relied on religion because that's an appealing shortcut to a moral system.

15:25.840 --> 15:26.840
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

15:26.840 --> 15:37.840
This quote is used and misused by Christian zealots to argue that this is a fundamentally Christian country and even some go on to suggest that the Constitution and the rights protected by it, they don't apply to non-Christians.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.840
Secondary to, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:39.840 --> 15:46.840
These people are fucked up dangerous cultists and it's fun to realize that the head of the Federal Election Commission is one such person.

15:46.840 --> 15:56.840
Also, two years prior to writing that letter, Adams had been part of the signing of the Treaty of Tripoli which was meant to establish commercial relations between the United States and Libya.

15:56.840 --> 16:07.840
Article 11 of that treaty presented by John Adams to be ratified by Congress begins quote, the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.

16:07.840 --> 16:08.840
Weird.

16:08.840 --> 16:22.840
Yeah. Trainer's comments about voter fraud came up in an interview with Newsmax where he was just complaining about the same stuff Trump's campaign is talking about in Pennsylvania where they believe that unless their poll watchers get as close as possible to the vote counters, then there must be fraud going on.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.840
Preferably with knives ready to scratch out Biden's name.

16:25.840 --> 16:26.840
Yeah.

16:26.840 --> 16:33.840
He said quote, I do believe there is voter fraud taking place in these places, otherwise they would allow observers to go in.

16:33.840 --> 16:39.840
This is a pretty standard bullshit artist tactic and I'll just lay this out for you how this works on a very basic level.

16:39.840 --> 16:40.840
So here's how it starts.

16:40.840 --> 16:43.840
You allege that there's some problem going on.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.840
In this case, votes being fraudulently counted.

16:45.840 --> 16:51.840
You have no proof that this is happening and it almost certainly is not happening but you need people to believe that it is.

16:51.840 --> 16:57.840
You insist that this is a major problem and then you propose a solution to this problem that you know will not be accepted.

16:57.840 --> 17:03.840
In this case, it's the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania mandating how the Philadelphia Board of Elections carries out their election.

17:03.840 --> 17:12.840
You know that your demand is going to be thrown out because the complaint is frivolous and the remedy would require the infringing of a locality on its ability to run its own election.

17:12.840 --> 17:15.840
It's certain to be rejected but that's good.

17:15.840 --> 17:18.840
You didn't want the complaint to be accepted anyway.

17:18.840 --> 17:21.840
If the complaint had been accepted, then things don't change at all.

17:21.840 --> 17:29.840
The poll watchers are a couple feet closer and you probably slow down the process or try to make a scene out of something but it's not like you're going to find any actual fraud.

17:29.840 --> 17:40.840
What works so much better is the complaint being thrown out because then you get to go around it and insist there must be a cover up going on or else your poll watchers would be allowed to do basically the counting themselves.

17:40.840 --> 17:43.840
You know, they gotta get as close as they can. Get up in there!

17:43.840 --> 17:45.840
You don't actually want the poll watchers to get closer.

17:45.840 --> 17:50.840
You want that request to be rejected so your surrogates can then create the appearance of suspicion.

17:50.840 --> 17:54.840
Everyone engaged in this knows exactly that this is the game.

17:54.840 --> 17:55.840
Totally.

17:55.840 --> 18:03.840
It's just outrageously tragic to see that someone so transparently craven could ever find themselves in the position of being the chair of the FEC.

18:03.840 --> 18:04.840
That is a real bummer.

18:04.840 --> 18:23.840
Yeah, I imagine that at the very least some of these douchebag republicans in government must be like, you know, when we hooked our wagons to Fox News 20 years ago, we thought we were going to be able to direct the mob and we wouldn't allow them into power.

18:23.840 --> 18:34.840
But now the FEC guy said we should start a holy war in the 15th century again. And I don't think that's okay. But we got beat by Fox News.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.840
Even Charles Koch is going around saying whoops.

18:37.840 --> 18:46.840
Yeah, whoops, my bad guys. Didn't mean to destroy democracy. Just wanted to make a shit ton of money and kill people. Why is that wrong?

18:46.840 --> 18:47.840
Whoops.

18:47.840 --> 18:48.840
Bummer.

18:48.840 --> 18:56.840
Yeah. Anyway, Alex is straight up. He's a real cool guy, and he wants you to know that if Trump had lost, he'd fucking tell you.

18:56.840 --> 18:57.840
Sure.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.840
Let me just tell you up front here what we got for you.

19:00.840 --> 19:08.840
I'm a realist. If Trump would have lost this election, I would have been completely honest about it and tell you I don't make stuff up.

19:08.840 --> 19:15.840
I would have said Joe Biden needs to be arrested as a communist Chinese agent on record, along with his son, the rest of his scumbag family.

19:15.840 --> 19:16.840
Sure.

19:16.840 --> 19:17.840
But that's another issue.

19:17.840 --> 19:18.840
Sure it is.

19:18.840 --> 19:19.840
Sure it is.

19:19.840 --> 19:26.840
I would love to see how that played out. Like months of him being like, they're going to steal the election, and then Biden wins. He's like, you know what? I got to be honest. They didn't steal this one.

19:26.840 --> 19:34.840
Can you imagine? Can you imagine how long we spent listening to him say the only way it's a fair election is if Trump wins?

19:34.840 --> 19:35.840
Yeah.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.840
For him to suddenly be like, guys, I got to be honest. This was a fair one.

19:39.840 --> 19:40.840
Yeah.

19:39.840 --> 19:40.840
And Biden won.

19:40.840 --> 19:41.840
Yeah.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.840
That would be bullshit. I would be mad at him.

19:43.840 --> 19:51.840
I got to be. I have nothing if I don't have my integrity. And I have to tell you, I'm eating crow on this one.

19:51.840 --> 20:03.840
Yeah. I would legit be furious. I would be furious. If Roger Stone just comes out now and he's like, guys, I did my research. This is a fair election. I would be furious with him.

20:03.840 --> 20:10.840
But that's what's so funny about a statement like this. Like if he had won, I would tell you. No, you fucking would. Get the fuck out of here.

20:10.840 --> 20:11.840
Of course not.

20:11.840 --> 20:16.840
Yeah. Good times. So anyway, Alex gets to talking about.

20:16.840 --> 20:20.840
Also, we didn't even account for the fact that he did win.

20:20.840 --> 20:21.840
Oh, yeah.

20:21.840 --> 20:22.840
He did win.

20:22.840 --> 20:23.840
There is that.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.840
You proved the. Yeah. Okay.

20:25.840 --> 20:32.840
So the Supreme Court, though, they may be making moves in order to make sure that Trump actually does get in.

20:32.840 --> 20:33.840
That's great.

20:33.840 --> 20:41.840
The Supreme Court, unprecedentedly came in and changed.

20:41.840 --> 20:47.840
In key battleground states, what Supreme Court justices were over what circuit?

20:47.840 --> 20:55.840
And so who will be ruling on what cases to take from the circuits and who will have control of those rulings to fast track?

20:55.840 --> 21:08.840
And they've put Gorsuch and they've put. Thomas and they've put Barrett and they put Alito and they've put Kavanaugh over the four key states.

21:08.840 --> 21:13.840
So they are locked and loaded. A major signal. They see the fraud. They know the scam.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.840
They're moving in.

21:14.840 --> 21:21.840
So there is a new Supreme Court justice. So it's not at all surprising that there would be a new split of circuit court assignments.

21:21.840 --> 21:25.840
Alex is saying this is unprecedented. I don't know what the fuck he's talking about.

21:25.840 --> 21:32.840
This is not some weird thing where the you know, the the Supreme Court justice rules over all of their assigned circuit.

21:32.840 --> 21:39.840
And as far as I can tell, this has just been really overblown by people in the the nonsense Alex Jones kind of world.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.840
It's some kind of sign that there's an elaborate plan unfolding.

21:42.840 --> 21:43.840
Sure.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.840
It smells a lot like QAnon.

21:45.840 --> 21:46.840
Yeah. Yeah.

21:46.840 --> 21:47.840
It's all very selective, too.

21:47.840 --> 21:55.840
Like you can say that Kavanaugh is over the Sixth Circuit, which includes Michigan, and Clarence Thomas is over the 11th, which includes Georgia.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.840
But for this to make sense, you have to ignore certain facts.

21:58.840 --> 22:05.840
Like, for instance, part of Alex's Stopping the Steel Tour 2020 was going to Arizona, which is in the Ninth Circuit under Elena Kagan.

22:05.840 --> 22:09.840
Weird. That's not part of his block of Trump lovers.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.840
Well, Arizona's lost.

22:11.840 --> 22:12.840
Sure.

22:12.840 --> 22:13.840
Yeah.

22:13.840 --> 22:18.840
And Pennsylvania is a state that Alex really does need to flip in order to make his stuff work mathematically.

22:18.840 --> 22:19.840
Sure.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.840
And that's under Alito, who he pointed out.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.840
But historically, Alex has not been into Samuel Alito.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.840
Well, now we've got a chance, though.

22:27.840 --> 22:28.840
Right.

22:28.840 --> 22:29.840
Yeah.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.840
Look, I don't know. This is just silly.

22:31.840 --> 22:35.840
It seems like someone grasping at straws, and I'm just not so into it.

22:35.840 --> 22:39.840
Yeah. Which is also literally how they could have picked these judicial circuit.

22:39.840 --> 22:40.840
Picking at straws?

22:40.840 --> 22:41.840
Just grabbing straws.

22:41.840 --> 22:42.840
It could have been.

22:42.840 --> 22:43.840
Yeah, it totally could be.

22:43.840 --> 22:48.840
I'm not interested in talking about this because there's bigger things to go on.

22:48.840 --> 22:49.840
Right.

22:49.840 --> 22:52.840
Like, do you know what motivates Joe Biden and Kamala Harris?

22:52.840 --> 22:53.840
I've got to go with blood.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.840
No, it's not blood.

22:55.840 --> 22:56.840
It's not blood.

22:56.840 --> 23:03.840
Make no mistake, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were picked because they want one thing, status and money.

23:03.840 --> 23:04.840
They don't want to run.

23:04.840 --> 23:05.840
That's two things.

23:05.840 --> 23:15.840
Joe Biden and Kamala are known as, put me on private jets, give me money, give me palaces, give me caviar, give me sex, give me drugs.

23:15.840 --> 23:20.840
And I don't want anything else.

23:20.840 --> 23:21.840
The bottom of the barrel.

23:21.840 --> 23:25.840
Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are about to release an album.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.840
Isn't that Lil Wayne ten years ago?

23:27.840 --> 23:28.840
What are we doing?

23:28.840 --> 23:30.840
Give me caviar, palaces.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.840
Is this the Carter III?

23:32.840 --> 23:33.840
What's happening right now?

23:33.840 --> 23:35.840
Drugs, sex.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.840
You know Joe Biden on the streets?

23:37.840 --> 23:39.840
He's always just like, oh yeah, you want something?

23:39.840 --> 23:42.840
Give me a palace.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.840
2 Chainz is president now.

23:44.840 --> 23:52.840
And 2 Chainz is also concerned about the relative tax rate of people, individuals making over $500,000 a year.

23:52.840 --> 23:59.840
I'm fascinated by this like, yeah, on the streets, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are known as people who just want private jets, sex and money.

23:59.840 --> 24:00.840
Really?

24:00.840 --> 24:01.840
Really?

24:01.840 --> 24:02.840
Really?

24:02.840 --> 24:03.840
Really?

24:03.840 --> 24:04.840
Really?

24:04.840 --> 24:05.840
That's pretty awesome.

24:05.840 --> 24:10.840
I do like, I do like the, the just, that's just throwing that out there.

24:10.840 --> 24:11.840
Why not?

24:11.840 --> 24:12.840
Why not?

24:12.840 --> 24:13.840
Just throw that out there.

24:13.840 --> 24:14.840
Yeah.

24:14.840 --> 24:16.840
Biden and Kamala Harris fucking rappers.

24:16.840 --> 24:17.840
Who gives a shit?

24:17.840 --> 24:18.840
Toss it out there.

24:18.840 --> 24:24.840
Over extravagant cartoonish pictures of rap excess.

24:24.840 --> 24:25.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:25.840 --> 24:26.840
It's young thug.

24:26.840 --> 24:32.840
So, uh, Alex gets to talking about these, uh, these Trump suits that have been thrown out in, uh, in Pennsylvania.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.840
And he has something to say about this judge.

24:34.840 --> 24:40.840
Loves money, power, social status, caviar.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.840
We're being gaslit.

24:42.840 --> 24:45.840
We're being lied to.

24:45.840 --> 24:54.840
That was an Obama judge that we knew was going to throw it out without even looking at the evidence in Pennsylvania.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.840
And that's what Trump's lawyers said.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.840
It's what I said.

24:59.840 --> 25:05.840
To be clear, Alex and his audience may not know this, but the president doesn't appoint state Supreme Court justices.

25:05.840 --> 25:10.840
They're elected in 38 states, whereas in 12, uh, other states, uh, other methods are used.

25:10.840 --> 25:14.840
Typically gubernatorial appointment or selection by the legislature.

25:14.840 --> 25:20.840
I guess the three states most relevant to Alex's hopes for a Trump win are Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Michigan.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.840
And all three of them are states where the Supreme Court justices are elected.

25:23.840 --> 25:31.840
There's no such thing as an Obama judge on these Supreme Courts unless you just define anyone who disagrees with you as an Obama judge, which seems to be what Alex is doing.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.840
Yeah, that seems a lot easier than thinking about it.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.840
He doesn't know shit.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.840
No. No, no, no, no. Not at all.

25:37.840 --> 25:42.840
Yeah. So, Alex is also, you know, he's in this, he's in this strange in-between place.

25:42.840 --> 25:50.840
Um, and he seems to be, on this Sunday episode, this, uh, this November 22nd, seems to be really leaning pretty hard into doomsday preaching.

25:50.840 --> 25:51.840
Sure.

25:51.840 --> 25:57.840
You're going to be at a point where half the children you know by age five are dying with brain tumors.

25:57.840 --> 26:09.840
You're going to witness total extermination, and you will finally meet God in your mind, or you will get on your knees to Satan, but you will go through the fire.

26:09.840 --> 26:14.840
No one will escape. Not me, not you, not anybody.

26:14.840 --> 26:15.840
Okay.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.840
It's pretty harsh. Um, there's a lot of doom talk.

26:18.840 --> 26:21.840
Half of the five-year-olds I know, or half of all five-year-olds?

26:21.840 --> 26:27.840
I think everyone, every five-year-old, yeah, not just you personally, not just Jordan.

26:27.840 --> 26:31.840
Because, I mean, if I got to pick, we'll see.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.840
I don't know any five-year-olds. I don't think I know any five-year-olds.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.840
Well, then you're safe. You're safe.

26:36.840 --> 26:39.840
Yeah, I guess I won't see this hellish thing come to pass.

26:39.840 --> 26:42.840
This is like Passover. You know, we're not going to have to deal with it.

26:42.840 --> 26:47.840
The plague of the first born is not so bad if you don't have kids.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.840
I mean, it's tough because you still care about your neighbors, about families and stuff.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.840
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

26:52.840 --> 26:55.840
Uh, yeah, it's just very dark. Alex seems to be thinking that everybody's fucked.

26:55.840 --> 26:56.840
Yeah.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.840
And a lot of crazy shit's going to happen.

26:58.840 --> 27:02.840
And then he remembers that Bill Cooper's book was called Behold a Pale Horse.

27:02.840 --> 27:03.840
Pale Horse.

27:03.840 --> 27:06.840
And he starts talking about that Bible verse.

27:06.840 --> 27:16.840
I looked and behold an ashen horse, and he who sat upon its name was Death, and Hades was following with him.

27:16.840 --> 27:28.840
Authority was given to them over a fourth part of the earth to kill the sword with famine and pestilence with the wild beasts of the earth.

27:28.840 --> 27:37.840
Let me tell you who rides that horse, who is the spiritual vessel of the Antichrist before the Antichrist comes is Bill Gates.

27:37.840 --> 27:41.840
The man who sits on the white horse of Death is Bill Gates.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.840
He's a middle man.

27:43.840 --> 27:46.840
And now you see it. He is your world ruler.

27:46.840 --> 27:52.840
He is the head of the G7. He is the last gate.

27:52.840 --> 27:53.840
The gate of Gates?

27:53.840 --> 27:57.840
The executor of you and your family.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.840
He will kill you and your family when he's done.

28:00.840 --> 28:01.840
And you will die.

28:01.840 --> 28:02.840
Wow.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.840
Shadow Gate. Bill Gate.

28:04.840 --> 28:08.840
I want a concrete job for Bill Gates.

28:08.840 --> 28:17.840
I feel like either he's constantly jockeying for and winning slash losing position or I think Alex might be making up a lot of the things Bill Gates does.

28:17.840 --> 28:23.840
I think it's got to be Alex is making it up because you wouldn't have time to readjust to those shifts in position.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.840
So often. Frequent.

28:25.840 --> 28:32.840
I know that I've been in jobs and I've had internal changes in position, let's say.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.840
You get moved to a different department or something.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.840
When I worked at Groupon, I was in a couple of different places.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.840
And man, you lose about a week of productivity.

28:40.840 --> 28:41.840
Totally.

28:41.840 --> 28:45.840
Trying to get reacclimated to the new workflow, the new responsibilities.

28:45.840 --> 28:49.840
Moved our manager to this team and this team is now being run a different way.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.840
You're using Salesforce a different way.

28:51.840 --> 28:52.840
Totally.

28:52.840 --> 28:53.840
You don't know what the fuck is going on.

28:53.840 --> 29:00.840
Bill Gates could never be a middle man and then one of the council of twelve and now he's running the G7.

29:00.840 --> 29:01.840
Totally.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.840
And also rides upon the pale horse.

29:04.840 --> 29:05.840
Right.

29:05.840 --> 29:09.840
Has he been death this whole time and has been Biden's time?

29:09.840 --> 29:12.840
No. No. No. No. No.

29:12.840 --> 29:13.840
Look.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.840
The pale horse has a few riders.

29:15.840 --> 29:16.840
Okay.

29:16.840 --> 29:18.840
I really didn't know that.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.840
Bill Gates came in and was like, hey buddy.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.840
C. Everett Koop was up there before.

29:24.840 --> 29:28.840
Is it like a Twilight Zone episode? If you kill death, you become death?

29:28.840 --> 29:29.840
Is that how it works?

29:29.840 --> 29:30.840
Yeah, it's like the Santa Claus.

29:30.840 --> 29:31.840
Oh, okay. I gotcha.

29:31.840 --> 29:38.840
So yeah, Alex is not only talking about how everyone's going to die and Bill Gates rides the pale horse.

29:38.840 --> 29:43.840
He also wants to tell you about how much everyone loves him now.

29:43.840 --> 29:55.840
I got calls the last three days from major world leaders, major people in government, the biggest people in media.

29:55.840 --> 30:05.840
And they said, all of them said the same thing. They said, Jones, when we go to dinner parties or these big Hollywood parties or with these big events, everyone loves you now.

30:05.840 --> 30:09.840
And everyone's asking about you.

30:09.840 --> 30:10.840
It's not about me.

30:10.840 --> 30:15.840
It's that I'm just I represent the resistance and people that are awake.

30:15.840 --> 30:18.840
I've just been so right for so long that now everyone loves me.

30:18.840 --> 30:19.840
Oh, man.

30:19.840 --> 30:24.840
I ever I keep getting phone calls about how they talk about me at Hollywood parties.

30:24.840 --> 30:25.840
Wow.

30:25.840 --> 30:26.840
Wow.

30:26.840 --> 30:27.840
Wow.

30:27.840 --> 30:32.840
Alex, it's me, the ghost of Nelson Mandela.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.840
We love you in heaven now.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.840
You're definitely going to be invited.

30:36.840 --> 30:39.840
This sounds like a fucking bragging teen.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.840
Yeah, this is so transparently.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.840
There's no reason.

30:42.840 --> 30:47.840
It's somebody at the lunch table who's 15 being like, man, I just talked to somebody famous.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.840
And you're like, I'm 15. I don't care.

30:49.840 --> 30:50.840
Yeah, yeah.

30:50.840 --> 30:55.840
I feel like my uncle knows Shaq.

30:55.840 --> 30:56.840
All right.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.840
OK, cool.

30:58.840 --> 30:59.840
All right, man.

30:59.840 --> 31:02.840
It doesn't raise your status or lower with me.

31:02.840 --> 31:04.840
I don't know why this is happening.

31:04.840 --> 31:05.840
Yeah.

31:05.840 --> 31:08.840
I look I don't believe that anybody called Alex.

31:08.840 --> 31:12.840
I don't believe I don't believe that anyone told them that there's people talking about him at Hollywood parties.

31:12.840 --> 31:14.840
I don't believe that people are talking about him at Hollywood parties.

31:14.840 --> 31:15.840
Right.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.840
But even if all of that was true, it still wouldn't matter.

31:18.840 --> 31:23.840
Because I imagine the real world version of this is people at dinner parties being like, you hear this fucked up weirdo?

31:23.840 --> 31:29.840
I feel like we would be more popular if famous people were talking about Alex Jones at dinner parties.

31:29.840 --> 31:33.840
Sooner or later, someone would be like, hey, did you know there's a podcast about him?

31:33.840 --> 31:37.840
Can you believe these two dickholes in Chicago make this guy listenable?

31:37.840 --> 31:41.840
Yeah, exactly.

31:41.840 --> 31:43.840
OK, hypothetical.

31:43.840 --> 31:44.840
Yes.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.840
Brian Stelter calls, says everybody loves him at MSNBC.

31:46.840 --> 31:47.840
What happens?

31:47.840 --> 31:51.840
I think Alex critiques his appearance on the phone.

31:51.840 --> 31:54.840
Alex tells him he looks weird.

31:54.840 --> 31:58.840
I think Alex is like, look, Stelter, Stelter, Stelter, I love to hear that.

31:58.840 --> 32:01.840
I love to hear that Tapper likes me.

32:01.840 --> 32:02.840
We love you.

32:02.840 --> 32:03.840
You look like a pedophile.

32:03.840 --> 32:04.840
God damn it, Alex.

32:04.840 --> 32:07.840
But we love you at MSNBC.

32:07.840 --> 32:09.840
But the reason you love me is I tell the truth.

32:09.840 --> 32:10.840
All right.

32:10.840 --> 32:11.840
And I got to tell you the truth.

32:11.840 --> 32:12.840
You're right.

32:12.840 --> 32:13.840
You look like a clown demon.

32:13.840 --> 32:16.840
This is why we love you, Alex.

32:16.840 --> 32:20.840
Your integrity shines through in this phone call.

32:20.840 --> 32:21.840
You're like the conspiracy.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.840
There is Don Rickles.

32:23.840 --> 32:29.840
Yeah, hockey puck.

32:29.840 --> 32:30.840
Oh, man.

32:30.840 --> 32:34.840
One of my favorite things about Alex is, in terms of his dumb ideas,

32:34.840 --> 32:38.840
is that the globalists don't have children.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.840
And I haven't heard him bring that up in a while.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.840
So I was excited for it to come back.

32:42.840 --> 32:46.840
This is a post-human system being built.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.840
And I told some of these folks they have kids.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.840
By the way, all people that call me have children.

32:50.840 --> 32:51.840
That's why these globalists don't have children.

32:51.840 --> 32:53.840
All of them.

32:53.840 --> 32:54.840
All of them.

32:54.840 --> 32:55.840
Not that many of you haven't had children,

32:55.840 --> 32:58.840
but the point is it creates a metaphysical thing where you're tied to humanity

32:58.840 --> 33:00.840
even more and your ancestors into the future.

33:00.840 --> 33:04.840
And it's just like it's a command once you have children.

33:04.840 --> 33:06.840
Alex loves this talking point, which is nonsense.

33:06.840 --> 33:09.840
You know, like the idea that the globalists don't have children.

33:09.840 --> 33:10.840
Sure, sure.

33:10.840 --> 33:12.840
Joe Biden's the lead globalist in the U.S. right now,

33:12.840 --> 33:15.840
and Alex knows better than anyone that he has at least one son,

33:15.840 --> 33:17.840
since he can't stop complaining about him.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.840
Stole him. Stole him from someone else's family.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.840
What about Bill Gates? He rides the pale horse.

33:21.840 --> 33:25.840
He's the globalist at the top of the rotation, and he has three kids.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.840
Well, the horse is actually a horse costume,

33:27.840 --> 33:30.840
so you have to have more than one person inside the horse costume.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.840
But then he still has one extra kid.

33:32.840 --> 33:33.840
You can't have three people in a horse costume.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.840
Hey, he puts it on his shoulders.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.840
I don't know about that.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.840
Klaus Schwab, the head of the World Economic Forum

33:39.840 --> 33:41.840
and the author of The Great Reset,

33:41.840 --> 33:45.840
that's another guy that Alex is really going on and on about these days.

33:45.840 --> 33:46.840
He has two kids.

33:46.840 --> 33:48.840
This is so dumb, and Alex says it all the time,

33:48.840 --> 33:52.840
not because it's true, but because it underscores an important piece of his cosmology,

33:52.840 --> 33:55.840
namely that there's something inherently suspicious or wrong

33:55.840 --> 33:59.840
about people who don't view reproducing as the most important piece of life.

33:59.840 --> 34:00.840
Yeah, yeah.

34:00.840 --> 34:04.840
This isn't about the globalists having kids or not having kids.

34:04.840 --> 34:10.840
It's literally a talking point just to throw out to make you feel like you need to have kids

34:10.840 --> 34:12.840
and there's something wrong if you don't.

34:12.840 --> 34:15.840
Yeah, I imagine, though, that that's probably, like,

34:15.840 --> 34:19.840
a part of the grape replacement bullshit that they all believe in,

34:19.840 --> 34:23.840
where it's like, hey, white people have to have more kids.

34:23.840 --> 34:24.840
It could be.

34:24.840 --> 34:25.840
That kind of thing, you know?

34:25.840 --> 34:26.840
Yeah, it could be adjacent to that.

34:26.840 --> 34:29.840
Because those quiver folk believe all that shit, you know?

34:29.840 --> 34:31.840
Yeah, might be.

34:31.840 --> 34:37.840
So Alex goes on to talk about here how he's ready to die, ready to die for the truth.

34:37.840 --> 34:42.840
And then he gets some tears, and I'll leave it up to you to decide whether you think these are genuine.

34:42.840 --> 34:43.840
Okay.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.840
And I'm ready to die. I'm ready to be imprisoned.

34:45.840 --> 34:48.840
I'm ready to put in solitary confinement. I'm ready to be tortured for the truth.

34:48.840 --> 34:52.840
Because I realize I can't sign on to the pedophilia and the Satanism.

34:52.840 --> 34:53.840
In fact, it's a very easy...

34:53.840 --> 34:56.840
I'm not into persecution. I'm not into masochism.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.840
I don't like pain.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.840
But I'll take it.

35:00.840 --> 35:02.840
I'll take as much as they're going to give me.

35:02.840 --> 35:06.840
Because that's so short compared to eternity.

35:06.840 --> 35:11.840
Because Jesus Christ is on the other side of it.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.840
All right. All right, buddy.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.840
And I wish we could have stopped this.

35:16.840 --> 35:17.840
I really wish we could have.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.840
But we can't.

35:19.840 --> 35:22.840
We're going to get hurt for what we've done.

35:22.840 --> 35:24.840
And quite frankly, we deserve it.

35:24.840 --> 35:29.840
So, again, we're on this doom tip here on this episode.

35:29.840 --> 35:32.840
I don't think that was sincere, really.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.840
But here's my thought. Here's what I want to discuss.

35:35.840 --> 35:36.840
Sure.

35:36.840 --> 35:41.840
Alex has this persecution fantasy where he's like William Wallace being tortured.

35:41.840 --> 35:42.840
Yeah, of course. Freedom.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.840
And his last words are, freedom!

35:44.840 --> 35:46.840
And he's also an anti-Semite, so it works well for him.

35:46.840 --> 35:47.840
It's all across the board.

35:47.840 --> 35:48.840
Yeah.

35:48.840 --> 35:50.840
I want to ask you this, though.

35:50.840 --> 35:51.840
Do you think that...

35:51.840 --> 35:55.840
The point that he wants to make is I'd be willing to do anything for the truth.

35:55.840 --> 35:56.840
Sure.

35:56.840 --> 35:59.840
Would he be willing to live in obscurity and poverty?

35:59.840 --> 36:00.840
Oh, absolutely.

36:00.840 --> 36:01.840
For the truth.

36:01.840 --> 36:02.840
No, that would be very hard.

36:02.840 --> 36:03.840
Yeah.

36:03.840 --> 36:04.840
Yeah.

36:04.840 --> 36:06.840
It's interesting to me to think about it.

36:06.840 --> 36:11.840
Like, well, okay, what if the truth required you to do a podcast out of your apartment?

36:11.840 --> 36:13.840
Would you do that, Alex?

36:13.840 --> 36:15.840
Would you give up your million dollar studio?

36:15.840 --> 36:16.840
I don't think you might not.

36:16.840 --> 36:18.840
Would you give up your perceived status symbols?

36:18.840 --> 36:24.840
All of this pretending about talking to world leaders and dinner party chatter about you.

36:24.840 --> 36:25.840
Yeah.

36:25.840 --> 36:31.840
Would you give up the pretense of being the leader of the Patriot movement and Texas royalty?

36:31.840 --> 36:33.840
Would you give up all that for the truth?

36:33.840 --> 36:34.840
Because I don't think you would.

36:34.840 --> 36:35.840
No.

36:35.840 --> 36:39.840
You'd probably get tortured, though, because then, you know, that's just part of the persecution

36:39.840 --> 36:40.840
fantasy.

36:40.840 --> 36:41.840
If you get to go out a martyr...

36:41.840 --> 36:48.840
Well, I mean, it's a lot more fun to think of dying instead of living with shit.

36:48.840 --> 36:49.840
Right.

36:49.840 --> 36:50.840
Right.

36:50.840 --> 36:55.840
I'd much rather die for my beliefs than live, like, really miserably forever.

36:55.840 --> 36:56.840
Yeah.

36:56.840 --> 36:57.840
Yeah.

36:57.840 --> 36:58.840
It's harder.

36:58.840 --> 36:59.840
It's a lot harder.

36:59.840 --> 37:00.840
Yeah.

37:00.840 --> 37:01.840
I don't think you'd be up for that.

37:01.840 --> 37:02.840
I don't think you would.

37:02.840 --> 37:03.840
No.

37:03.840 --> 37:04.840
He thinks that dying is the hardest thing you can do.

37:04.840 --> 37:05.840
And it's not.

37:05.840 --> 37:06.840
It's very easy.

37:06.840 --> 37:11.840
So Alex talks here about, again, it's just like, these are fucking scary times.

37:11.840 --> 37:12.840
Bad stuff's coming.

37:12.840 --> 37:14.840
God's going to judge us.

37:14.840 --> 37:19.840
Because now we're entering the scary time, and it just gets scarier from here on out.

37:19.840 --> 37:25.840
And the men will be measured, and the women will be measured, and we're all going to be

37:25.840 --> 37:26.840
measured.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.840
We're all going to be put through the fire.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.840
And I welcome the fire.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.840
I welcome the fire!

37:33.840 --> 37:35.840
I welcome the fire.

37:35.840 --> 37:36.840
Sorry.

37:36.840 --> 37:44.840
Because it will cleanse us, and it will burn away the lies and separate the metal from

37:44.840 --> 37:46.840
the trash.

37:46.840 --> 37:53.840
And in that fire, we will find our ascendance, or we will find our destruction.

37:53.840 --> 37:55.840
The real test is now here.

37:55.840 --> 38:00.840
From here on out, the gates of hell have been opened.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.840
What the fuck is he going on about?

38:02.840 --> 38:03.840
Man, I swear.

38:03.840 --> 38:10.840
I swear to God, if the culture at large gave it six months with a new Trump administration,

38:10.840 --> 38:13.840
Alex would be like, yeah, burning witches is totally fine again.

38:13.840 --> 38:14.840
Of course.

38:14.840 --> 38:15.840
When did it ever go wrong?

38:15.840 --> 38:22.840
I just like to imagine some people are like, hey, man, yeah, I don't like the Federal Reserve.

38:22.840 --> 38:28.840
And then just by gradual weirdness intensifying, you get to a point where you're like, yeah,

38:28.840 --> 38:30.840
the cleansing fire does need to come.

38:30.840 --> 38:33.840
Everyone should be baptized in fire.

38:33.840 --> 38:34.840
You're right.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.840
That'll be purifying.

38:36.840 --> 38:41.840
And if you can't float, well, we know what's going on with you.

38:41.840 --> 38:44.840
Yeah, that's like, this trajectory is strange.

38:44.840 --> 38:47.840
But he's in a bad place.

38:47.840 --> 38:56.840
And I will give him a little bit of a kudo, tip of the cap, in that he does end the show

38:56.840 --> 38:59.840
more weird than threatening, I think.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.840
This clip's a little bit longer.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.840
It's about two minutes, because there's no way I could cut this at all.

39:04.840 --> 39:09.840
This is just Alex begging leftists to accept Jesus.

39:09.840 --> 39:10.840
Okay.

39:10.840 --> 39:11.840
All right.

39:11.840 --> 39:14.840
I'm listening. I got an open heart and an open mind.

39:14.840 --> 39:15.840
It's very strange.

39:15.840 --> 39:16.840
Let's give it a shot.

39:16.840 --> 39:21.840
You know, if I was a globalist, I would see you and see you as an animal, see you as trash.

39:21.840 --> 39:22.840
Cool.

39:22.840 --> 39:24.840
And I would feed on you.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.840
But God's Spirit leaves me if I start thinking like that.

39:27.840 --> 39:28.840
Easter sin, still going on.

39:28.840 --> 39:32.840
I'm not going to treat you like that, but I will tell you straight up to your face.

39:32.840 --> 39:38.840
If you are a Democrat, if you are a leftist, if you are an antifa, you're an idiot.

39:38.840 --> 39:45.840
Literal Count Dracula, and then Prince Philip, who runs him, and Prince Charles, who are

39:45.840 --> 39:53.840
the Dracula line, literally, literally, this is Hungarian, Romanian.

39:53.840 --> 39:54.840
These are the dudes.

39:54.840 --> 39:55.840
Sure.

39:55.840 --> 39:58.840
For a thousand years, these are blood drinkers.

39:58.840 --> 40:04.840
You are literally on your knees to the seed of Satan, the dragon.

40:04.840 --> 40:08.840
And you think it's going to give you milk and cookies at night.

40:08.840 --> 40:09.840
It isn't.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.840
You are fools and you are in grave danger.

40:12.840 --> 40:16.840
And I'm begging you, I'm begging you for your own soul.

40:16.840 --> 40:17.840
We will destroy you.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.840
God's going to destroy you.

40:19.840 --> 40:22.840
I'm asking you to get off the side of Satan.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.840
I don't want to destroy you.

40:24.840 --> 40:25.840
Thanks.

40:25.840 --> 40:26.840
No pleasure in this.

40:26.840 --> 40:27.840
I don't want to destroy you.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.840
I don't want God to destroy you.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.840
I'm just begging you, please stop serving Satan.

40:31.840 --> 40:32.840
Turn back now.

40:32.840 --> 40:33.840
There's still time.

40:33.840 --> 40:35.840
There's still time.

40:35.840 --> 40:36.840
You can do it.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.840
You can renounce Bill Gates.

40:38.840 --> 40:40.840
You can renounce fallacy.

40:40.840 --> 40:42.840
You can renounce Ted Turner.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.840
You can renounce George Soros.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.840
And you can accept Jesus Christ.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.840
You've got to do it quickly.

40:48.840 --> 40:54.840
There isn't much time.

40:54.840 --> 40:58.840
This is such a serious situation.

40:58.840 --> 41:02.840
Please, please turn back now.

41:02.840 --> 41:05.840
God doesn't want to destroy you.

41:05.840 --> 41:08.840
God doesn't want to annihilate you.

41:08.840 --> 41:09.840
He wrote a book about it.

41:09.840 --> 41:12.840
But you've got to reject the power of the earth.

41:12.840 --> 41:16.840
You have to reject Satan or you don't have any hope.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.840
You must reject Joe Biden.

41:18.840 --> 41:19.840
So let me ask you.

41:19.840 --> 41:24.840
As an open hearted leftist who has just heard Alex Jones' plea.

41:24.840 --> 41:26.840
This is the best he can do.

41:26.840 --> 41:28.840
How do you feel?

41:28.840 --> 41:31.840
Are you ready to renounce Anthony Fauci?

41:31.840 --> 41:33.840
Uh, I mean, yeah.

41:33.840 --> 41:36.840
I really don't have a problem with that.

41:36.840 --> 41:40.840
I'll just pick somebody else who's very competent.

41:40.840 --> 41:44.840
I don't have any attachment to Fauci.

41:44.840 --> 41:50.840
Fauci could be replaced with another talented, like that's it.

41:50.840 --> 41:54.840
It's certainly much less attachment than you have to someone like, let's say, Prince Philip.

41:54.840 --> 41:58.840
Who you are desperately attached to.

41:58.840 --> 42:07.840
I do find it hilarious that he kind of correctly, let me put it this way.

42:07.840 --> 42:14.840
He embodies the point of Dracula, which is that foreigners are very weird and we should be terrified of them.

42:14.840 --> 42:15.840
Prince Philip?

42:15.840 --> 42:17.840
That's what I'm saying.

42:17.840 --> 42:19.840
I mean, he's British, obviously.

42:19.840 --> 42:20.840
He's not from America.

42:20.840 --> 42:27.840
And in the same way, you know, Dracula was written to terrify people about the eastern block of Europe coming over into their homes.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.840
Stealing their women and such.

42:29.840 --> 42:32.840
I guess. I'm not that scared of Prince Philip either, though.

42:32.840 --> 42:33.840
I think we should be.

42:33.840 --> 42:34.840
Alright, fair enough.

42:34.840 --> 42:36.840
So, we get to the 23rd now.

42:36.840 --> 42:43.840
And this episode opens with Alex, I would say, accepting that Biden is going to win.

42:43.840 --> 42:44.840
Sure.

42:44.840 --> 42:45.840
But he's reframing it a little bit.

42:45.840 --> 42:46.840
Okay, good.

42:46.840 --> 42:56.840
We are 58 days now in the overthrow of our republic and the installation of a foreign Chinese backed communist agent known as Zhou Baidu.

42:56.840 --> 42:58.840
So, that's how it is now.

42:58.840 --> 43:01.840
It's going to happen, but it's the overthrow of the country.

43:01.840 --> 43:02.840
Sure, sure, sure.

43:02.840 --> 43:12.840
So, we know that Alex has this thing that he talks about all the time, which is Operation Lockstep, which is what he has made up or cribbed from a meme or something.

43:12.840 --> 43:13.840
Absolutely.

43:13.840 --> 43:17.840
About a 2010 document from the Rockefeller Foundation.

43:17.840 --> 43:26.840
What is it called? The Future of Technology and International Development document.

43:26.840 --> 43:31.840
And he's turned those memes about that and all this shit into Operation Lockstep.

43:31.840 --> 43:35.840
It almost got deeply, deeply exposed on Rogan's podcast.

43:35.840 --> 43:36.840
Very close.

43:36.840 --> 43:50.840
So, him and Tim Dillon and Jamie were just not able to synthesize the information, take it in well enough to rebut Alex's points in real time, which is something that Alex benefits from.

43:50.840 --> 43:53.840
Yeah, no, they really teamed up to do a shit job and fuck over everybody.

43:53.840 --> 43:58.840
Well, yes, but also, again, I think I said this on the episode.

43:58.840 --> 43:59.840
I know.

43:59.840 --> 44:01.840
It's a complex thing.

44:01.840 --> 44:04.840
It would be very difficult to know nothing about it.

44:04.840 --> 44:05.840
They did do a bad job.

44:05.840 --> 44:07.840
But I don't know if they could have done a good job.

44:07.840 --> 44:09.840
Exactly, exactly. I know full well.

44:09.840 --> 44:12.840
I just want to make that clear. We're not piling on...

44:12.840 --> 44:13.840
No, no, no, no.

44:13.840 --> 44:15.840
Except in the places where it's deserved.

44:15.840 --> 44:16.840
Yeah.

44:16.840 --> 44:18.840
That's not one of them. That's not a fair criticism.

44:18.840 --> 44:20.840
They should have known ahead of time.

44:20.840 --> 44:25.840
Yeah, exactly. The biggest problem, before they even began, they were outgunned and had no chance.

44:25.840 --> 44:26.840
Yes, yes.

44:26.840 --> 44:29.840
So, Alex is now turning this into something else.

44:29.840 --> 44:32.840
This is now, like, Lockstep is something he's known about forever, man.

44:32.840 --> 44:33.840
Of course!

44:33.840 --> 44:44.840
Eleven years ago, I put out a little documentary called Endgame 2.0.

44:44.840 --> 44:47.840
It's since been taken off the internet. It was internet only.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.840
Didn't put a DVD out.

44:49.840 --> 44:58.840
And in that film, we laid out their plan to collapse society and their plan to trigger an economic collapse using a virus.

44:58.840 --> 45:06.840
And the reason I knew that was it had just come out in the Operation Lockstep, which is now about eleven years ago.

45:06.840 --> 45:10.840
Right off the top, Operation Lockstep is not a thing. That is all just made up.

45:10.840 --> 45:13.840
Alex did not know about the term Lockstep when he made the film Endgame.

45:13.840 --> 45:20.840
It's a very recent element of his conspiracy theories that he's been trying to retcon into being part of his work all along.

45:20.840 --> 45:23.840
It's absolutely 100% not true.

45:23.840 --> 45:30.840
Alex started bringing up the word Lockstep immediately after people like Jim Fetzer started misrepresenting that Rockefeller document,

45:30.840 --> 45:36.840
scenarios for the future of technology and international development, and memes started spreading about those misrepresentations.

45:36.840 --> 45:39.840
That's the actual basis for Alex's reporting.

45:39.840 --> 45:43.840
But let's entertain Alex's lie here, though, and let's tease this out.

45:43.840 --> 45:50.840
He's claiming that in the updated version of Endgame, he knew all this stuff that was going to happen because he's read this imaginary Lockstep plan.

45:50.840 --> 45:52.840
Right. That hadn't been written at that time.

45:52.840 --> 45:53.840
That is the big problem.

45:53.840 --> 45:54.840
Yeah, that is an issue.

45:54.840 --> 45:55.840
There's another problem.

45:55.840 --> 45:56.840
What's that?

45:56.840 --> 45:57.840
There's no such thing as Endgame 2.0.

45:57.840 --> 45:59.840
Okay, well that's also a bit of a problem.

45:59.840 --> 46:03.840
Alex is referring to Endgame 1.5, which was his...

46:03.840 --> 46:05.840
That was the supplementary director's cut of Endgame.

46:05.840 --> 46:06.840
Sure, sure.

46:06.840 --> 46:09.840
That came out the same year as the original film, which was 2007.

46:09.840 --> 46:14.840
The Rockefeller document that the Lockstep conspiracy is based on wasn't written until 2010.

46:14.840 --> 46:15.840
There's an issue?

46:15.840 --> 46:16.840
Yeah. There's an... Oh!

46:16.840 --> 46:17.840
What's that?

46:17.840 --> 46:18.840
We forgot that Alex is psychic.

46:18.840 --> 46:21.840
Oh, shit! Shit, fuck.

46:21.840 --> 46:22.840
He can see the future.

46:22.840 --> 46:23.840
He keeps forgetting.

46:23.840 --> 46:24.840
In his dreams.

46:24.840 --> 46:25.840
Shit!

46:25.840 --> 46:26.840
Keep forgetting about that.

46:26.840 --> 46:28.840
Timelines be damned.

46:28.840 --> 46:31.840
You know, it's really hard to fact-check somebody who can see into the future.

46:31.840 --> 46:32.840
Yeah.

46:32.840 --> 46:33.840
That's an issue.

46:33.840 --> 46:35.840
And I refuse to engage with it, quite frankly.

46:35.840 --> 46:36.840
I'm gonna...

46:36.840 --> 46:37.840
What, the second sight?

46:37.840 --> 46:39.840
I've been thinking about this for a while.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.840
I think I gotta just come out with it.

46:41.840 --> 46:43.840
I don't believe he's psychic.

46:43.840 --> 46:47.840
I don't know how that's going to...

46:47.840 --> 46:48.840
Oh boy, Jordan's leaving.

46:48.840 --> 46:49.840
Jordan's taking off his headphones.

46:49.840 --> 46:54.840
I don't...

46:54.840 --> 46:55.840
And I can't.

46:55.840 --> 46:59.840
I can't believe he is because then this becomes a silly exercise.

46:59.840 --> 47:01.840
Yeah, that becomes a real problem.

47:01.840 --> 47:03.840
Not that this isn't silly to begin with.

47:03.840 --> 47:09.840
Of all the ones that I facetiously entertain, and even defend, that one I just never touch

47:09.840 --> 47:11.840
because fucking, I'm out.

47:11.840 --> 47:12.840
I'm out when you say you're psychic.

47:12.840 --> 47:15.840
Yeah, it's fun to think that he thinks he is, but...

47:15.840 --> 47:16.840
Yeah.

47:16.840 --> 47:17.840
Yeah.

47:17.840 --> 47:21.840
The other thing too that I want to point out about this is this is such a really good example

47:21.840 --> 47:26.840
of these things that Alex does where he tries to insert current things into his past work.

47:26.840 --> 47:27.840
Yeah.

47:27.840 --> 47:32.840
Like a lot of his work is so vague and so, you know, it's in the documents, it's in the

47:32.840 --> 47:36.840
white papers, you know, all the, I have the documents, I can prove everything and then

47:36.840 --> 47:37.840
nothing's ever proven.

47:37.840 --> 47:38.840
Yeah.

47:38.840 --> 47:42.840
Everything is so hyper nonspecific that, like, he complains about the Rockefellers all the

47:42.840 --> 47:43.840
fucking time.

47:43.840 --> 47:44.840
Sure.

47:44.840 --> 47:47.840
And yeah, you could find tons of him talking about the Rockefellers trying to take over

47:47.840 --> 47:48.840
the world ten years ago.

47:48.840 --> 47:49.840
Right.

47:49.840 --> 47:51.840
You can go to Endgame and find talk of the Rockefellers.

47:51.840 --> 47:52.840
Totally.

47:52.840 --> 47:53.840
Being evil.

47:53.840 --> 47:57.840
He did not know about a document that would be written three years later when he made

47:57.840 --> 47:58.840
Endgame.

47:58.840 --> 48:00.840
But it looks good now.

48:00.840 --> 48:06.840
It is unfortunate that part of the game of being so vague and tossing so much shit at

48:06.840 --> 48:11.840
the wall is if you want to say, like, oh, I knew about Operation Lockstep eleven years

48:11.840 --> 48:17.840
ago, and then toss that shit out, you can be like, okay, well, here's a clip of me saying

48:17.840 --> 48:21.840
that the Rockefellers are going to kill everybody and that it's in the white paper.

48:21.840 --> 48:27.840
The white paper I was referring to was the as heretofore yet unwritten, you know.

48:27.840 --> 48:32.840
That clip may exist somewhere, but I went and I found the, like, release, like, sort

48:32.840 --> 48:38.840
of article on Prison Planet about the Endgame 1.5.

48:38.840 --> 48:39.840
Sure.

48:39.840 --> 48:42.840
There's no mention of the Rockefellers, there's no mention of Lockstep, none of this shit.

48:42.840 --> 48:43.840
It was a big road, though.

48:43.840 --> 48:48.840
It's just like, hey, man, we're going to have more interviews with Big Chimp Jim Tucker

48:48.840 --> 48:49.840
and Daniel Estelin.

48:49.840 --> 48:51.840
Wait, did you say Big Chimp?

48:51.840 --> 48:52.840
Big Jim.

48:52.840 --> 48:55.840
I heard Big Chimp and I was like, ooh, Big Chimp Tucker?

48:55.840 --> 48:57.840
I like that name way more.

48:57.840 --> 48:59.840
That would be better.

48:59.840 --> 49:05.840
What is it, a giant chimpanzee or a really old chain-smoking anti-semite?

49:05.840 --> 49:07.840
I'll take the chimp.

49:07.840 --> 49:08.840
I will also take the chimp.

49:08.840 --> 49:12.840
So Alex is talking about Klaus Schwab a whole bunch.

49:12.840 --> 49:14.840
The guy who wrote this great reset book.

49:14.840 --> 49:21.840
And he has one particular thing that he says about him that is worth saying is not true.

49:21.840 --> 49:25.840
The populist movement spreading across the world is stronger than ever.

49:25.840 --> 49:31.840
And now you've got Boris Johnson and you've got John Kerry and you've got all these world

49:31.840 --> 49:37.840
leaders saying the COVID-19 lockdown is a punishment to populists to bring them under

49:37.840 --> 49:42.840
control and they admit it's a social movement and Klaus Schwab says it's not a threat.

49:42.840 --> 49:44.840
COVID-19 is not a threat.

49:44.840 --> 49:49.840
All that's nonsense, but it is worth pointing out also that Boris Johnson is now on the outs.

49:49.840 --> 49:55.840
He is no longer the heroic populist that Alex claimed he was because I guess he's taken

49:55.840 --> 49:56.840
COVID seriously.

49:56.840 --> 50:00.840
Yeah, he had to do the lockdown and so, you know.

50:00.840 --> 50:02.840
Now he's a globalist.

50:02.840 --> 50:08.840
Yeah, unfortunately whenever you eventually succumb to reality, everybody who's unreality

50:08.840 --> 50:10.840
does not like you anymore.

50:10.840 --> 50:14.840
Anybody who's still committed to this will turn on you very quickly.

50:14.840 --> 50:18.840
So also I want to talk about this Klaus Schwab thing.

50:18.840 --> 50:23.840
He's claiming that Schwab admitted in his book The Great Reset that COVID-19 is not a threat.

50:23.840 --> 50:26.840
Alex is doing this based on a cherry picked quotation that reads,

50:26.840 --> 50:31.840
quote, unlike certain past pandemics, COVID-19 doesn't pose a new existential threat.

50:31.840 --> 50:35.840
This quote is taken out of context to imply that he's saying that COVID isn't really a threat

50:35.840 --> 50:37.840
and it's just being used to take over society.

50:37.840 --> 50:38.840
Sure.

50:38.840 --> 50:42.840
If you actually go to the text, you'll find that the words, quote, new existential threat

50:42.840 --> 50:45.840
have a specific meaning in the context of the writing.

50:45.840 --> 50:50.840
This quote is found after a discussion of the bubonic plague and the germs that were brought to

50:50.840 --> 50:55.840
North America by the first European explorers, which is why the word new is in that sentence.

50:55.840 --> 50:56.840
Yeah, there's that.

50:56.840 --> 50:59.840
Those were instances of new existential threats to populations.

50:59.840 --> 51:03.840
COVID-19 is dangerous and deadly, but it's not the bubonic plague.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.840
And I don't think that's a controversial take.

51:05.840 --> 51:08.840
Schwab isn't saying that COVID-19 is not a threat.

51:08.840 --> 51:12.840
Just that, quote, unless the pandemic evolves in an unforeseen way,

51:12.840 --> 51:17.840
it's not going to be something that poses an existential threat to the world like the plague.

51:17.840 --> 51:22.840
Alex is taking that quote out of context and giving it the context he wants it to have, which isn't real.

51:22.840 --> 51:27.840
Alex hasn't read this book, and I would go so far as to say that his researchers probably haven't either.

51:27.840 --> 51:31.840
I say this because that quote is taken from the introduction to the text.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.840
So I could see them finding that and being like, good enough.

51:33.840 --> 51:34.840
Good enough.

51:34.840 --> 51:35.840
That'll do.

51:35.840 --> 51:36.840
Don't worry about it.

51:36.840 --> 51:37.840
Let's go to lunch.

51:37.840 --> 51:38.840
Oh boy.

51:38.840 --> 51:39.840
I don't know if you've heard this.

51:39.840 --> 51:40.840
Jordan?

51:40.840 --> 51:41.840
Yeah.

51:41.840 --> 51:42.840
I don't know if you've heard this news.

51:42.840 --> 51:43.840
What was that?

51:43.840 --> 51:44.840
Did you hear that people are talking about Alex at dinner parties?

51:44.840 --> 51:46.840
I did not hear about that, actually.

51:46.840 --> 51:47.840
And by the way, I just want to give you some good news.

51:47.840 --> 51:51.840
We're going to go to your calls and get to the big news next segment.

51:51.840 --> 51:59.840
I've gotten calls, I get a lot of calls, but I've gotten calls from some of the biggest people out there.

51:59.840 --> 52:04.840
And they said, man, Alex.

52:04.840 --> 52:08.840
It's incredible when I go to these dinner parties in New York or dinner parties in L.A.

52:08.840 --> 52:17.840
or I'm talking to, you know, top people, household names, all they want to talk about is you and all they want to talk about is the future.

52:17.840 --> 52:23.840
And this one individual this weekend was like, what's it like to have everybody now accepting you and celebrating you?

52:23.840 --> 52:28.840
And I'm like, it's good to know people are finally understanding we're not playing games.

52:28.840 --> 52:32.840
What's it like to have movie stars throwing banquets in your honor?

52:32.840 --> 52:40.840
What is it like for Rick Schrader to call you up and say, man, you remember when I was in pool hall junkies?

52:40.840 --> 52:42.840
We really crushed it in that movie.

52:42.840 --> 52:43.840
Anyways.

52:43.840 --> 52:49.840
Alex, what is it like for James Woods to have commissioned a bronze sculpture of you in his front lawn?

52:49.840 --> 52:52.840
Alex, what is it like?

52:52.840 --> 52:56.840
I got a call from the chair that Clint Eastwood talked to. I am talking to big people.

52:56.840 --> 52:58.840
I'm guessing he got a call from Coach Dave.

52:58.840 --> 52:59.840
Totally.

52:59.840 --> 53:05.840
Someone sent me a video of him saying that Alex is the leader of their movement.

53:05.840 --> 53:06.840
Oh boy.

53:06.840 --> 53:12.840
And my immediate response was like, well, add four info warriors to the tally.

53:12.840 --> 53:15.840
I feel bad that we did an episode about that dude.

53:15.840 --> 53:16.840
Yeah, me too.

53:16.840 --> 53:19.840
Quite frankly, given how irrelevant he is.

53:19.840 --> 53:21.840
I have no idea how little...

53:21.840 --> 53:25.840
We were punching laterally at the time that we did the Coach Dave, though.

53:25.840 --> 53:31.840
I think I got tricked by the fact that Right Wing Watch would have posts about him.

53:31.840 --> 53:33.840
Sure, sure, sure. From time to time.

53:33.840 --> 53:37.840
I thought for sure this is somebody who is much more relevant than they are.

53:37.840 --> 53:40.840
No, he has like a hundred views on his channel.

53:40.840 --> 53:42.840
It's really Right Wing Watch's fault.

53:42.840 --> 53:45.840
Eh, I understand why you... I mean, they're supposed to watch the Right Wing.

53:45.840 --> 53:50.840
He has a Right Wing voice, but I thought he was somebody who had a bit more of an audience than he did.

53:50.840 --> 53:53.840
Now that Jared Holt's gone, I'm going to shit all over Right Wing Watch.

53:53.840 --> 53:54.840
Oh shit.

53:54.840 --> 53:56.840
Yeah, that's right. I'm a Holt stan.

53:56.840 --> 54:00.840
You just like that dog. You just like his dog.

54:00.840 --> 54:07.840
So yeah, I don't know. I don't think that Alex is getting these calls, like I said, but he is very fixated on this.

54:07.840 --> 54:15.840
And interestingly, as he's being feted by the people who are the most important in society,

54:15.840 --> 54:18.840
the heads of state, the media figures, celebrities.

54:18.840 --> 54:19.840
Everybody.

54:19.840 --> 54:23.840
It just so happens that his every move is being watched by the feds.

54:23.840 --> 54:24.840
Bummer.

54:24.840 --> 54:30.840
Do you understand that I get followed home every day by Black-ish Yves?

54:30.840 --> 54:35.840
When I eat in restaurants, FBI and CIA, we ran it, we checked it.

54:35.840 --> 54:39.840
FBI and CIA come and sit next to us.

54:39.840 --> 54:41.840
And when I come over, they put masks on and say, have a good day, Mr. Jones.

54:41.840 --> 54:43.840
They go wait in the parking lot.

54:43.840 --> 54:44.840
They put masks on?

54:44.840 --> 54:45.840
Mission Impossible masks?

54:45.840 --> 54:47.840
I go across the street and have a hamburger.

54:47.840 --> 54:48.840
Federal agents follow me.

54:48.840 --> 54:51.840
And they want me to know they're there.

54:51.840 --> 54:53.840
This is the type of stuff that happened to Martin Luther King.

54:53.840 --> 54:54.840
What?

54:54.840 --> 54:56.840
Wow. Wow.

54:56.840 --> 54:58.840
Wow, we're going for it.

54:58.840 --> 54:59.840
That's narcissistic.

54:59.840 --> 55:00.840
We're shooting for it, huh?

55:00.840 --> 55:04.840
But I really do love the idea of like some guy being like, hey, Alex.

55:04.840 --> 55:06.840
I'm CIA.

55:06.840 --> 55:07.840
I want you to know I'm here.

55:07.840 --> 55:10.840
Enjoy your hamburger.

55:10.840 --> 55:13.840
Hey, Alex, I'm CIA.

55:13.840 --> 55:14.840
My buddy here is FBI.

55:14.840 --> 55:19.840
We are working on a joint task force about your diet.

55:19.840 --> 55:21.840
What the fuck is this stupid shit?

55:21.840 --> 55:28.840
I think that could legitimately drive a real paranoid person insane if people were actually doing that.

55:28.840 --> 55:33.840
I think if people actually did that to Alex, he would feel so validated.

55:33.840 --> 55:35.840
Like it would make him feel good.

55:35.840 --> 55:43.840
I think if you're a paranoid narcissist who also has a modicum of celebrity, you might have people who interact with you who are like fans.

55:43.840 --> 55:44.840
Sure.

55:44.840 --> 55:45.840
Or something.

55:45.840 --> 55:46.840
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

55:46.840 --> 55:51.840
And then because your brain doesn't interpret information correctly, you could be like, oh my god, that guy was CIA.

55:51.840 --> 55:52.840
Sure.

55:52.840 --> 55:54.840
Because they're wearing a mask and maybe they're in a suit or something.

55:54.840 --> 55:56.840
You're a noticeable person.

55:56.840 --> 55:57.840
Yeah.

55:57.840 --> 56:01.840
People turn and look whenever they're in a restaurant and they're like, hey, is that Alex Jones?

56:01.840 --> 56:05.840
Or maybe one time he was coming home from work and there was a black van that happened to be behind him.

56:05.840 --> 56:06.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:06.840 --> 56:09.840
Not every fucking black van is the feds.

56:09.840 --> 56:11.840
Grow up, man.

56:11.840 --> 56:21.840
That would be an easy, I think that would be an easy situation that we should, nobody who's not in law enforcement, nobody who's not a fed can have a black van.

56:21.840 --> 56:23.840
I think that's the new rule.

56:23.840 --> 56:26.840
That way we can all identify them all the time.

56:26.840 --> 56:28.840
I think they would be against that.

56:28.840 --> 56:29.840
I'm sure they would be.

56:29.840 --> 56:30.840
Alex would be against that.

56:30.840 --> 56:31.840
I'm sure he would be too.

56:31.840 --> 56:33.840
Black van enthusiasts would be against that.

56:33.840 --> 56:36.840
Well, we can, you have to, okay, fine.

56:36.840 --> 56:41.840
You have to paint a unicorn or a dragon on the side of your black van if you are not a fed.

56:41.840 --> 56:42.840
I think we could reach this compromise.

56:42.840 --> 56:44.840
I think that's a good one.

56:44.840 --> 56:46.840
So this is real strange.

56:46.840 --> 56:54.840
This is real, like he had this doom and gloom sort of like God's cleansing fire is going to purify the world on Sunday.

56:54.840 --> 56:55.840
Yes.

56:55.840 --> 56:56.840
Now on Monday.

56:56.840 --> 56:57.840
Not long ago.

56:57.840 --> 57:01.840
He's continuing with these fantasies about how all the celebrities love him now.

57:01.840 --> 57:02.840
Sure, sure.

57:02.840 --> 57:05.840
And everybody is watching his every move.

57:05.840 --> 57:06.840
All the law enforcement.

57:06.840 --> 57:09.840
And then I got this news.

57:09.840 --> 57:14.840
When you decide to spread the word and when you decide to share the info and download it and save it,

57:14.840 --> 57:16.840
because there may be a coming time when we're not here.

57:16.840 --> 57:22.840
I mean, I've been waiting a while to say this may be my last broadcast and I've never done that in 27 years on air.

57:22.840 --> 57:23.840
Oh, really?

57:23.840 --> 57:24.840
Tomorrow I'm going to have discipline.

57:24.840 --> 57:28.840
I'm going to do my last broadcast ever hypothetically, because it could be.

57:28.840 --> 57:30.840
I mean, now's the time.

57:30.840 --> 57:31.840
Now's the time.

57:31.840 --> 57:34.840
Bingo!

57:34.840 --> 57:35.840
Neighbors, neighbors.

57:35.840 --> 57:36.840
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

57:36.840 --> 57:37.840
Yes, that is correct.

57:37.840 --> 57:38.840
That is correct.

57:38.840 --> 57:40.840
Yeah, of course.

57:40.840 --> 57:42.840
The hypothetical last episode.

57:42.840 --> 57:51.840
I was like, all right, no matter what, the 24th is either going to be the day that he sets out to do his last episode,

57:51.840 --> 57:58.840
or it will be yet another time that he has said he is going to and completely fucks up.

57:58.840 --> 58:07.840
Your eyes and your joy every time he sets you up only to make you disappointed is beautiful.

58:07.840 --> 58:08.840
Palpable.

58:08.840 --> 58:10.840
After all these years, Dan.

58:10.840 --> 58:15.840
Still crazy after all these times Alex said he was going to do his last episode.

58:15.840 --> 58:19.840
I could not be more excited when I heard that.

58:19.840 --> 58:21.840
I thought, hooray.

58:21.840 --> 58:23.840
To the point where I almost just turned off this episode.

58:23.840 --> 58:26.840
Yeah, I'm surprised that we're not skipping ahead to the 24th now.

58:26.840 --> 58:30.840
Well, we've got to listen to some calls, because Alex takes some calls.

58:30.840 --> 58:31.840
Great.

58:31.840 --> 58:33.840
Man, not a great session.

58:33.840 --> 58:35.840
Eli's on the same subject in Indiana.

58:35.840 --> 58:36.840
One of info words is taken out.

58:36.840 --> 58:39.840
Go ahead.

58:39.840 --> 58:40.840
Hello, Alex?

58:40.840 --> 58:41.840
Yes, you're on the air.

58:41.840 --> 58:47.840
Hi, yeah, it's Elle, and I go by Elle, but it's Andrew Elle.

58:47.840 --> 58:49.840
Wow, I can't believe I got this.

58:49.840 --> 58:56.840
So, really, my big question is, I'm wondering, like, how am I supposed to get our information

58:56.840 --> 59:01.840
if they succeed in shutting down?

59:01.840 --> 59:02.840
Then she hung up.

59:02.840 --> 59:03.840
Okay.

59:03.840 --> 59:04.840
Well, sorry, ma'am.

59:04.840 --> 59:05.840
Very bizarre.

59:05.840 --> 59:06.840
I think they hung up on her.

59:06.840 --> 59:12.840
But you've got to have that cough button there for that asshole exhale.

59:12.840 --> 59:14.840
I agree.

59:14.840 --> 59:16.840
I will say this.

59:16.840 --> 59:22.840
I think Alex and I both experienced the same thing, which is that I did not hear a single

59:22.840 --> 59:23.840
word that she said.

59:23.840 --> 59:29.840
I think for him, it was because he responded to her name with just, like, ugh.

59:29.840 --> 59:31.840
Yeah, he was not happy about it.

59:31.840 --> 59:36.840
And for me, it was because I could not stop laughing at him just hearing a name and going,

59:36.840 --> 59:37.840
ugh.

59:37.840 --> 59:41.840
He's very pissed off.

59:41.840 --> 59:43.840
Does he know, or is it just that it's Andrew Elle?

59:43.840 --> 59:50.840
I think the problem is that he said the wrong name, and then she corrected the name but

59:50.840 --> 59:54.840
gave too much of a correction, and he doesn't care for this kind of thing.

59:54.840 --> 59:55.840
No, that's true.

59:55.840 --> 01:00:00.840
Well, she also did the thing where she asked if she was on the air, which we all know sets

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:01.840
him off.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.840
Yes, he has a hair trigger with that.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:04.840
Yes, yeah, yeah.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:09.840
So he gets another call, and this person wants to talk about hypothetical violence.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:14.840
I'm not calling for any type of physical violence, but it could get to that point.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:19.840
If they keep going down this road, what are we going to do?

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:25.840
What must they think of us to do what they did, and we just accept that?

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.840
I just can't go along with it.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.840
I can't go along with it.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:31.840
I'm in the same boat.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:32.840
Alex is eating lunch.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:33.840
Yeah, of course.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.840
I did that.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:35.840
Delicious.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:36.840
I did that because I have to always...

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:37.840
You love it.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840
I love catching him take a chop.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.840
There are recurring themes in the show.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.840
I think that's the most important of them.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.840
Honestly.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:45.840
Yeah, I think so too.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.840
I think so too.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:47.840
Yeah.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:52.840
So this last call here on the 23rd episode that we're going to listen to a little bit

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:58.840
of is sort of a natural Infowars kind of caller.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.840
This is not good.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.840
I didn't enjoy hearing this.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.840
Look, I don't have anything against Jewish people.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:05.840
My wife is Jewish.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:06.840
Stop.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.840
My wife is Jewish.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.840
I have Jewish children.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.840
But what is online?

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.840
What is Jesus?

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.840
What is the murder of the Tsar?

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.840
And what does dominion have in common?

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.840
There's all occult Jews behind it.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.840
And people...

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.840
I know that dominion is hooked into Venezuela.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.840
I know that CNBC's done reports on it being a fraud.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.840
It's been decertified in a lot of states.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:32.840
For the people trying to act like we can just trust dominion is just ridiculous.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.840
So this caller is trying to speculate that there are occultic Jews who are behind stealing

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:40.840
the election as well as the murder of the Tsar and all sorts of pretty much every nefarious

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.840
thing throughout history.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.840
And Alex's response is like, hey man, dominion Venezuela.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:53.840
Instead of being like, hey guy, how about you calm down with this anti-semitic tropes?

01:01:53.840 --> 01:02:00.840
Bruh, I've been doing one thing for 20 years and that is telling people I'm not an anti-semite.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.840
And now you're making me say, well, I mean some Jews.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:05.840
Yikes.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:06.840
That's not good.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:07.840
Yeah, that caller was bad.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:08.840
Yeah.

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:15.840
So, we get to the 24th and I was a little bit worried that Alex wasn't going to do his

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.840
last show.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.840
Why would you be worried about that?

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:22.840
Is that a long, long, long, long, long track record of not following through on promises?

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.840
He consistently doesn't do those things.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:29.840
So, I was very shocked when he started the show like this.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:34.840
I put a headline up today that I've thought about doing for a long time, but haven't done

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.840
yet for the live show.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:37.840
And it says it all.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.840
It says, this might be my last broadcast, Alex Jones.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:46.840
And I have had many points in my life where I've almost said this on air because the situation

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.840
was so serious, but it never rose to the occasion.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:55.840
I'm not saying it's my last broadcast, but now I have to treat every minute on air as

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:56.840
if it could be my last.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:00.840
And I'm going to explain to you why and really just tell you the truth.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.840
Do it.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.840
It's the only thing I can do.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.840
Do it.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.840
About how serious the situation is and what we're facing.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:08.840
Do it.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.840
Yeah.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.840
So, I think that this was the biggest cop out.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:13.840
Yeah.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:17.840
It's like, okay, yeah, this is going to be my last, but it's just saying like, let's

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.840
live each day like it's our last.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:20.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.840
It's this bizarre, like a weird motivational nonsense.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:24.840
Yeah.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.840
And people even go biblical on him and say, this is lukewarm.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:29.840
Yeah.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:34.840
And we all know how the great feels about lukewarmity.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:41.840
I kind of wanted a little more out of the idea of a last episode than just this.

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:42.840
Sure.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:43.840
It seemed a little flat to me.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.840
Yeah.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:49.840
I wanted a little bit more pageantry, but he does actually get a little dramatic.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.840
This is a little dramatic.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.840
Maybe not as dramatic as I want it to be.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:59.840
If Joe Biden's able to wiggle his way into the White House and scam his way into the

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:05.840
White House and get the nuclear codes and all the rest of it, then I will officially

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.840
make the statement and put an article out declaring the United States dead.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:11.840
Dead.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.840
And creating a tombstone.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.840
Hell, I'm not even having it carved in stone.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:21.840
In fact, I will and placed here in the TV radio newsroom.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.840
Newsroom.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:24.840
And it'll be on sale at...

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:25.840
Yeah.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.840
That'll be a great gimmick.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.840
Buy yourself a tombstone of America.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:29.840
I could have a keychain of that.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:30.840
Yeah.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:31.840
I would take a keychain of that.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.840
We're going to have shirts with hats.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:34.840
Totally.

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:35.840
We'll have pills shaped like tombstones.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.840
Honestly, I think we should do that first just to get out from under, just to steal

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:41.840
it first.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.840
I think that'd be hilarious.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.840
Look, I don't want to turn into Kiss, like when they're selling coffins and stuff.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.840
That's fair.

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:48.840
That's fair.

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:49.840
That's fair.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.840
It's too much.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.840
It is.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.840
Tombstones.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:55.840
No, we might have to go to a boutique shop for that.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.840
Might have to go to Redbubble for that.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:04:59.840
Yeah.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:00.840
Yeah.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:03.840
So, I mean, all right.

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:04.840
I think that's a little dramatic.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:05.840
Maybe.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.840
But I should say that Alex is being very serious about this.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:08.840
Okay.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:09.840
Let me just get into it right now.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:13.840
So I'll normally come on and tell you what's coming up, then end up spending an hour just

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.840
getting into the basic news and never hitting the heart of the matter.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:23.840
But let me just now square up and just tell you the awful truth.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.840
Do it.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:25.840
It's bad.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:26.840
We're done here.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:30.840
Admitting it's bad, we have a shot at stopping it and turning it around.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:34.840
But that tombstone is very real.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:35.840
Okay.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.840
All right.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:50.840
United States of America born July 4th, 1776, United States of America died January 20th,

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.840
2021.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:06:00.840
Because if we don't admit how grave the situation is, we don't have a shot at stopping this.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.840
He's definitely going to try and sell that tombstone.

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:03.840
Oh, totally.

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.840
Also, I like the pun, how grave the situation is.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.840
I know, it's great.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:07.840
Not bad.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:08.840
It's great.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.840
Not bad, Alex.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:14.840
And he did do what I appreciate the most, which is avoid saying pun not intended.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:15.840
Sure.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:16.840
I like it.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.840
Attend your puns.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.840
Take some restraint.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:19.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.840
So Alex has never put out a headline like this.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.840
This is maybe my last show ever.

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.840
Sure.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:26.840
He's talked about it a whole lot.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:27.840
Of course.

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:28.840
On his show.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:29.840
And the idea of doing that headline.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:30.840
Pretty much all.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:31.840
But he's never done that headline.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:32.840
Okay.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:33.840
And it turns out they fucked up the headline.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:34.840
Oh no.

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:38.840
I have been reading and studying The Globalist for 30 plus years.

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.840
I've been on air for 27.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:46.840
And I've never put a headline out like they just had on screen.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.840
This could be my last broadcast.

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.840
Tune in if you want to save yourself.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.840
Never put a headline out like that.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:58.840
The Globalists have accelerated their timetable and are planning to engineer a complete global

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:06.840
collapse on the ashes of which they will construct.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.840
What?

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.840
The new future.

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:11.840
Oh.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:15.840
I shot that out in a voice memo real quick to the fellow filling it out before I went

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.840
live and he didn't quite get exactly what I said.

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:18.840
Talking 100 miles an hour.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.840
So we'll fix that headline.

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:21.840
My fault.

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:22.840
Good last show.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:23.840
Good stuff.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:24.840
Really.

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.840
Send an email.

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.840
Write it down.

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:33.840
I was talking really fast because I had just done a bunch of speed and voice memo probably

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:34.840
was incoherent.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.840
You know what?

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:45.840
If a comic had an absurd intro that had to be part of the whole bit, they wrote it down

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:46.840
for you.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:47.840
You bet.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.840
They wrote it down for you.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.840
They didn't say like, hey repeat this after me.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:51.840
No.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.840
Hey, I have a tongue twister that you need to memorize.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.840
Exactly.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:55.840
Yeah.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.840
That's what they have to be.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:57.840
Yeah.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.840
I would say that he's been talking about doing his last show forever.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.840
He's decided, fuck, I'm going to do it.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.840
Prepare.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:06.840
Yeah.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.840
Isn't it supposed to be a time capsule thing?

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:09.840
He wings it.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:17.840
Isn't the idea of his last episode to be like, in case I go off air, this is like a bottle.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:21.840
This is a bottle episode that will stand up to greatness.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.840
Going out like the Sopranos.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.840
He's who he is and then the lights go off.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.840
The end.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:28.840
No finale.

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.840
No wrapping up anything.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.840
He does have a very serious message though.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:33.840
What's that?

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.840
Well, do you want to know what his biggest message is?

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:36.840
What's that?

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:41.840
And the biggest message I have before I give you my personal message here is to the people

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:47.840
that serve the system, the yuppies, the trendies, the leftist enforcers.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.840
Sure.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:50.840
You're the biggest chumps of them all.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.840
You're the biggest schmucks, the biggest fools.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:53.840
And I don't say that with pleasure.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.840
I wish you weren't so delusional.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.840
You think you're part of the ruling class.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.840
You think you're part of the eugenics takeover.

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:02.840
You think you're part of the winning team.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:06.840
You are anything but that.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:14.840
You are the weak traitors that actually chose to join this evil because you were seeking out power.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.840
I think that Alex would think that we're leftist enforcers.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:19.840
I guess.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:26.840
I mean, if he had to wrestle with our existence, it would obviously say that we're trying to shut him down.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:27.840
Totally.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.840
We're like some Soros plant or some bullshit.

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:30.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:36.840
And I can say fully, I mean I've checked in on this a lot and really thought about it.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.840
I'm not thinking I'm part of the power structure.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:40.840
No, no, no.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.840
I don't think I'm part of the establishment.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:48.840
Honestly, I can think of very few times in all of human history when leftists felt like they were on the winning side.

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:54.840
Yeah, I even want to take it more granularly and just talk about you and me.

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.840
You're one of three or four people that I see.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.840
Sure, sure.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.840
Or talk to on a regular basis.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.840
I mean, yeah, we're not yuppies or trendies.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:06.840
You, my parents, Soros.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.840
Sure.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:08.840
That's it.

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:09.840
Yeah.

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.840
Oh shit.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.840
Yeah, that's all three.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.840
I blew it.

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:19.840
No, I find this to be a really bizarre thing for him to say.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:25.840
It's like his big message is like, you people are chumps.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:26.840
God.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:34.840
His last message is like a playground insult based in vindictiveness and misunderstanding the people you disagree with.

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:35.840
Great.

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:36.840
Who cares?

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.840
Your last message is a waste.

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.840
Trivia.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.840
So annoying.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.840
Anyway, you remember how globalists don't have kids?

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:44.840
Yes.

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:45.840
Remember that?

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.840
100% of globalists don't have kids.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.840
Right, right, right.

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.840
Correct.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.840
Yeah, Alex said that on Sunday.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:51.840
Yes.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:52.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.840
This is their takeover with Ted Turner and Bill Gates.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:56.840
None of them have kids.

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:57.840
Cloud Schwab and all of them.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:58.840
Warren Buffet.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:06.840
Doesn't have kids.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:19.840
To shut down the free market capitalist society, they say to save the earth, but really it's to give them total power and control when they live the most opulent lifestyles and have all these children.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.840
Wait, wait, hold on.

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:21.840
They have all these children.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.840
I thought they don't have kids because it's a post-human future.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.840
Oh, maybe nothing you say means anything.

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.840
Dan, he's right 99% of the time.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.840
He's not right 100%.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:31.840
That would be unreasonable.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:32.840
Oh, okay.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.840
Well, here's another time he's wrong.

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:35.840
Okay.

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:39.840
There's a photo of Fauci 15 years ago.

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:40.840
Doesn't have kids.

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.840
With Tom Brokaw, George Soros.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.840
None of whom have kids.

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:47.840
Barbara Walters, Brooke Astor.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:51.840
That's Anderson Cooper's lady, mommy.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.840
Anderson Cooper's mom is Gloria Vanderbilt.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:54.840
Yeah, that would be who she is.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:58.840
Alex should know that because he keeps talking about how he's the last Vanderbilt, but she's not.

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.840
He's kind of gone on about it.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:01.840
Can't keep his enemies straight.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:06.840
Brooke Astor had one child who died in 2014 at the age of 90.

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.840
Significantly older than Anderson Cooper.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:10.840
Taken too soon.

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:13.840
Yeah, so I guess we've got to put that to 98% right?

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:14.840
98% right, okay.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.840
The batting average is going down.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:17.840
Uh-huh.

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.840
So this is supposed to be his last episode, right?

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:21.840
Yes.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:29.840
And again, I've already brought this up, but I'm really struggling with this because it shouldn't be time-stamped.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.840
Yeah.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.840
It shouldn't be dated.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.840
So if I were Alex, I would stay away from headlines.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:41.840
I would stay away from, like, things that are going to be like, oh, this is November 2020 stuff right here.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.840
Just do a victory lap if it's your last show.

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:44.840
Bingo.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:45.840
You do a victory lap.

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.840
You do, like, here are all of our achievements.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:50.840
Do a fucking commentary for Endgame.

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:51.840
Anything.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.840
Do a this is your life.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.840
Yeah.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:55.840
Yeah.

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.840
Although you wouldn't be able to get too many of his former acquaintances.

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.840
A lot of them might not come back.

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:04.840
Instead, what he does is, like, just headlines and shit.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:09.840
New York City will have COVID checkpoints at T-bridges and crossings.

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:24.840
They will grab people out of their cars and buses and take them to testing sites to provide education and quarantine.

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.840
So that's martial law.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.840
That's the secret police.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.840
So this is based on some reality.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:36.840
There are COVID-19 checkpoints in New York, but they aren't set up to stop everyone like you might imagine when Alex says checkpoints.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:42.840
It's specifically about people arriving in New York from out of state, and it won't be so much like they snatch people up.

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:43.840
There's testing on site.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:52.840
And then there's they want to advise people arriving to the city about quarantine requirements and the fact that you could be hit with a fine if you don't follow them.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:14:00.840
I don't like this much because, you know, it's kind of scary, but also I don't like this pandemic and people not taking it seriously.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:01.840
So here we are.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:09.840
Also, I'm much more interested in another part of the sheriff, Joseph Fuchito, his comment about this stuff.

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:24.840
OK, quote, deputy sheriffs are investigating massive events that violate a panoply of criminal fire building, health and other regulatory laws at locations such as illegal fight clubs, underground raves and illegal gambling dens.

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:33.840
These activities were illegal and sometimes deadly before COVID-19, and the public safety hazards regarding them have been amplified exponentially by the pandemic.

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:43.840
I did not know that illegal fight clubs were a modern problem in New York, but I want Alex to talk more about that instead of this other bullshit.

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:51.840
Deadly illegal, you know, the problem the problem that we're seeing now in 2020 is too many people in New York are cool.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.840
I should have known.

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.840
I mean, I guess I don't know.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:58.840
I guess I should have assumed there would be fight clubs.

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.840
I just I mean, I don't know.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.840
I don't know.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.840
I mean, I'm not saying it's not possible that there aren't fight clubs, but it does seem to be.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.840
Underground boxing? Like it's not like Fight Club the movie.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.840
I would hope not.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:14.840
I would assume.

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.840
Although somebody does need to blow up MasterCard.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.840
It's a strange thing to read in that statement.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:19.840
That is a little weird.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.840
Raves? Totally understand.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:22.840
Totally understand.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:23.840
Yeah, of course.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:24.840
I'm aware that those exist.

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:25.840
Always going to happen.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:26.840
Some sort of underground gambling.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:27.840
Even in war-

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.840
That makes more sense to me.

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:31.840
War-torn countries have underground raves and underground gambling.

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:32.840
Sure.

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:34.840
Fight clubs, though, bro.

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:36.840
That's the first one on his list.

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.840
Yeah.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.840
That makes it sound like fight clubs are a real issue for him.

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:41.840
Yeah.

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.840
This is my third fucking fight club this week.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.840
That's before raves on the list?

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.840
Is even more like what?

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:51.840
Anyway, I think Alex is burying the lead on this one.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:54.840
So this will live on as his final episode.

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:57.840
And unfortunately, certain things will not look so good.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:58.840
Oh, no.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:02.840
A lot of his COVID feelings, in particular, not great.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:06.840
And if you go to one of these centers, they will kill you.

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:12.840
Not your average hospital, but the special COVID centers are leftist execution docs.

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:13.840
Yeah.

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:14.840
So if you go to a COVID center-

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:15.840
Yeah.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:16.840
We're leftist-

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.840
You go get tested for COVID and they put you in the hospital with COVID.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.840
Leftists are going to kill you.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:26.840
A leftist execution doc, though, does sound like it could be a doc for executing leftists.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:29.840
Sitting on the leftist execution doc of the bay.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:30.840
Nice.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:31.840
Watching.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:32.840
I don't know.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:33.840
Don't worry about it.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:34.840
Thanks.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:35.840
Let's move this one on.

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:38.840
So it turns out they won't just kill you, these leftists.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:39.840
Okay.

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:40.840
They'll also laugh at you.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:41.840
Oh.

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.840
You didn't die of COVID.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:48.840
They kill you with you chained down, blowing your lungs out.

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:53.840
And they get off on it, reportedly walk over and laugh at you when you're chained down.

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.840
They're going to kill you and your family.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:56.840
They love it.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:57.840
God, they love it.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.840
Reportedly.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:16:59.840
Reportedly.

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.840
Reportedly is doing a lot of work for one adverb.

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:02.840
Yeah.

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:07.620
I mean, for the people who are first responders and people who are in the medical field who

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:13.800
are being deeply traumatized by virtue of the help that they're providing and what they

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:21.140
have to see, this is such a disgusting thing to be putting out into the world.

01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:24.720
This sort of perspective is just shameful.

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:29.600
One, it ranks in terms of his career.

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:35.080
He said a lot of really fucked up horrible things that this kind of thing continuously,

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:41.820
this characterization of medical professionals dealing with this crisis, it's up there with

01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:42.820
Sandy Hook.

01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:44.400
It's up there with the Boston bombing.

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.400
Totally.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.400
It's disgraceful.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.400
No, we can talk about-

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.800
It may not be legally actionable necessarily, but it's as gross.

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.800
Right.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.880
And this goes back to our earlier conversation too.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:00.800
We can talk about all the hundreds of thousands of deaths which are fucking terrifying and

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:06.760
tragic and awful, but at the same time, there are millions of people, millions of people

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:12.260
who are going to live with the effects of this fucking psychic destruction for the rest

01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:13.260
of their lives.

01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:21.440
And not to mention people who don't die, but have effects and lingering health consequences

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:24.240
that aren't captured by statistics well.

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:29.000
That is an untold story that people have to live with.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.160
I mean, just something small like, hey, guess what?

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:34.360
For the rest of your life, you have shortness of breath forever.

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.420
That's it.

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:39.880
And you're like, I understand that that's fucked.

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:40.880
It's just fucked.

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:41.880
Yeah.

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:43.160
Maybe you were a runner before and now you're not.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.160
Never again.

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.160
Right.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:51.920
There are tons of things like that and then the situations that doctors and nurses are

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:57.840
put in, the people who are medical professionals who have been infected themselves.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:58.840
It's just disgusting.

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:05.400
I mean, the evolution from they're just fucking in the hospital and getting drunk to they

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.640
kill you and laugh at you.

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.940
Just go fuck yourself.

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:13.440
These people would have happily executed Clinton for Benghazi.

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:14.440
Yeah.

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:15.440
You know?

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.440
Yeah.

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:17.440
Like happily.

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:18.440
They would have executed Bill.

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:19.440
They might even.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.920
Yeah, they would even perhaps have laughed while they were strapped down.

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:23.920
Yeah.

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:24.920
Yeah.

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:25.920
Poor Charlie Daniels.

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.160
Can't tweet about it anymore.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.160
No.

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.160
Poor guy.

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.480
So look, that's shitty.

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:35.320
And I think it's important to take those moments and be kind of serious about it because it

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.320
is serious.

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.320
It's fucking awful.

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.320
No, it's tragic.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.500
But there's also time to laugh.

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:42.880
Like when Alex talks about Daleks with swabs and guns.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:43.880
It's too good.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:44.880
I've got bad news for you.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:45.880
What's that?

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:46.880
Are they back?

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:47.880
The Daleks are back.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:48.880
Oh.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.880
Do we have an update?

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:50.880
Okay.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:51.880
They have been disarmed.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:52.880
They have been disarmed?

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.880
Did we disarm them?

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:54.880
I think we might have.

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:55.880
I think we did it.

01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:56.880
I think we laughed.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.240
We're leftist enforcers, Dan.

01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:04.000
I think we laughed too much at it that now the Daleks are not armed.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000
That's good.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
No, it's not.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
It's terrible.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
No, that's smart.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
It's good on their part.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.520
Get rid of the cars and make you ride those trains where there'll be the nice little checkpoints

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:16.600
and the police officers with the little robots that come up and look like a Dalek and a Doctor

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.720
Who.

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:24.740
And there'll be armed cops behind them and they'll shove a swab and oh, here in the database,

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:32.000
you go bye-bye to a secret COVID facility staffed by Antifa doctors.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.200
Okay.

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:38.280
You know, it's those small things that make me know he's listening.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:43.600
It's those small things where you're like, you knew the guns in the Daleks was too much.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.880
It was too funny and too stupid.

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:46.880
It was too good.

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.280
It was too good.

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:50.120
You found out and we all know.

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:53.320
Like Icarus, you flew too close to the sun with that one.

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.400
The Daleks were great.

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:59.880
The swabs were fantastic, but you had a compartment with a gun in it and you've gone too far,

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:00.880
sir.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.640
Yeah, you're into like hilarious territory.

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.640
Exactly.

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:11.280
And that's why now it's a fucking Dalek with a swab and there's cops with guns behind them.

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.320
That's somehow silly.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:16.040
That's silly as shit to me because now we're not just sending Dalek.

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.240
Now we've increased our infrastructure costs.

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.240
Well, certainly.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:24.080
Now you have cops who are working with Dalek partners, which sort of raises the question

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.980
why you couldn't just have the cops swab people.

01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:33.500
I got a new movie for you, sequel to Canine Cop, Dalek and Hanks Solving Crimes.

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.500
I could see that.

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:35.500
I could watch that.

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:36.500
Yeah.

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:40.320
So also we're, we're sort of really hyper focused on the Dalek and we're not talking

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.720
about how there are Antifa murder hospitals.

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.720
Well, sure.

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.720
Sure.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.840
But I mean, we always know those in there.

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:48.160
We're leftists and forcers, Dan.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.560
We don't need to worry about that.

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:54.360
Oh my God, Antifa murder hospital.

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:58.900
I sometimes wish we were as cool as they think we are.

01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:04.100
I would love for that to be like the next Blumhouse movie or something.

01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:10.200
Like it could be like a real B kind of horror movie that caters to the conservative audience.

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.200
Yeah.

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.200
Yeah.

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:13.200
Yeah.

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.200
Antifa murder hospital.

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.200
Yeah.

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.200
Yeah.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.200
Yeah.

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.640
But then at the last moment they're like, actually it was a false flag by the Nazis

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.840
and the Antifa murder hospital was a Nazi.

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:21.840
I'm sorry.

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.840
I'm sorry.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:23.840
I'm getting excited.

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:24.840
Especially don't yell Nazis.

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:29.720
If you're going to yell something, bingo is justifiable.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:32.860
I'm pretty sure you can yell Nazis in a crowded theater.

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:33.920
That was never settled.

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:38.480
I just don't want the neighbors to get some sort of very weird idea about what's going

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:39.480
on.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:44.800
I do like the idea that there that we're suddenly screaming like, Oh shit, Nazi showed up.

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:50.320
So Alex has a new thing to complain about, a new primary source.

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.760
And we'll get into it a little bit after he talks about it.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:54.960
What I'm telling you is the truth.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:01.100
You just saw a UN Rockefeller lockstep plan put out 10 years ago when they put lockstep

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:08.120
out on paper saying what you just saw with the woman in charge.

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:11.180
She doesn't ever get to see her family.

01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:12.220
She can't travel.

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:20.300
She gets meat once a year, her husband's looked into a robot machine for them, what they're

01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:23.180
going to be, what they're going to do.

01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:29.560
That wasn't some cartoon made by George Arwell saying, Oh, this is terrible.

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:34.160
They're saying this is good because they're showing children that.

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.200
Since you asked, the one day a year is on her birthday.

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:37.200
Is it on her birthday?

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:38.200
Okay, good.

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.200
Good.

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:43.960
So this is a little thing called plannedopolis and Alex is presenting this with no evidence

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:48.760
and saying that it's, or I mean it does exist, but he's without evidence, he's claiming this

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:51.840
is something that was forcefully shown to kids.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:55.520
And I think that, you know, it's possible that it might've been shown in some classrooms

01:23:55.520 --> 01:24:00.080
in an educational setting, but I'm certain he's making it up because it's a cartoon and

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:05.320
it's believable that it could be shown in classrooms to indoctrinate the kids.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:10.160
As somebody who knows his Miyazaki history, I'm pretty sure that Orwell worked on Spirited

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:11.160
Away.

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.160
Perhaps.

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.160
Yeah.

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.720
It could have been Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, but I'm pretty sure it was Spirited

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:15.720
Away.

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:23.360
I have to say for Alex's sake, he did fairly accurately describe this cartoon.

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.360
Okay.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.360
All right.

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:30.560
And then there is a woman who has, there's limited travel, you can only have meat on

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:36.160
your birthday, her husband is hooked up to a machine at work, not in the way that maybe

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:41.300
you might fantasize that being, but anyway, this is a video from a group called Forum

01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:42.300
for the Future.

01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:46.600
In 2011, they released a series of videos that sought to depict what the potential cities

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:51.200
of the future could look like given trends that were existing then in the world.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:55.160
As is Alex's habit, he's found one that he thinks he can claim is prophetic and he's

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:59.760
choosing to ignore the fact that there were four scenarios that this group depicted.

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.320
The one Alex chose is closest to the things that he makes his audience scared of, with

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:07.480
a strongly centralized government, food rationing, etc.

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:13.880
This was a scenario titled Plandopolis, but there was also Communicity, Sprawlville, and

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.480
Renewabod.

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:19.600
These are each depictions of how city planning could evolve in a scenario where alternative

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:23.800
energy sources were made primary and what life might look like depending on the strategies

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:25.500
that are employed.

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:30.440
None of this is meant to illustrate a plan, it's an exploration exercise, as the people

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:33.640
who put this together actually said explicitly.

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:38.440
Quote, Forum for the Future's scenarios are not predictions or depictions of desirable

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:42.760
futures which we wish to promote, and they do not represent our vision of a sustainable

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:43.760
future.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:47.180
They're pictures of different possible futures designed to help people understand the major

01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:49.220
trends that are shaping our world.

01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:53.280
They aim to challenge, inspire, and excite so that people feel motivated to plan for

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:55.980
a better, more sustainable future.

01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:59.800
So again, I mean this is almost exactly the same thing as the lockstep, where he's taken

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:05.520
that one plan, not plan, one scenario out of the four and decided, oh that's what they're

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:06.520
going to do.

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.120
They said they're going to do it!

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:12.240
It's Operation Lockstep, oh my god, Plandopolis is the plan!

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.000
Now I'm not going to talk about Renewabod.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.720
Well, don't worry about Renewabod.

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:21.880
Although now, the moment you said Renewabod, I got transported into the writer's room with

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:26.600
the whiteboard and the million different city name puns.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.720
And it's just, that's where I belong, Dan.

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:33.360
Coming up with renewable names for different cities.

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.600
Also, Renewabod is what I'm going to think when I'm doing sit-ups.

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:40.480
Sure, sure, alright.

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:45.460
So this is a bunch of nonsense, but I do think that it's probably going to be a very large

01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:50.320
piece of, it's probably going to be the next lockstep, the Plandopolis, and I think you'll

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:54.840
probably hear a bit about it from other, but like, the thing that was really weird is when

01:26:54.840 --> 01:27:00.840
I was looking into this, there were like Reddit threads from 2012, 2015 about this, like this

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:04.040
has made the rounds in conspiracy circles for a while.

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:05.040
We've been here before.

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:06.800
Yeah, this isn't new.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.120
So here's where things get weird.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.120
Okay.

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.120
This is Alex's last show.

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.120
He gets into bell-bottoms?

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.120
No.

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.120
Oh.

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:15.120
It's his last show.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.120
Okay.

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:20.800
As such, he wants you to know that the globalists, they believe that they're getting messages

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:21.800
from aliens.

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:22.800
Sure.

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:23.800
We know this.

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:24.800
Yeah.

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:25.800
That's what they believe.

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:26.800
They believe that.

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.800
He doesn't believe that?

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:29.060
Yes.

01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.060
He's not crazy?

01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:31.060
No.

01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:32.060
This is what they believe.

01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:33.060
Exactly.

01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:34.760
He's reporting on this as a scientist.

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:35.760
Yes.

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.920
Now wait till the end of this clip.

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:37.920
Okay.

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:40.120
I know the globalists follow this.

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:46.400
They believe they're getting interdimensional information, just like in the movie, Buckle

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:49.280
Ruban's Eye, a great B movie.

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:55.160
They believe they're getting information over the ether to build this and they've been being

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.200
sent the transmission forever.

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:04.240
You can go back to the most ancient civilization 6,000 years ago in the Sanskrit and the hieroglyphs

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:08.320
and they said, we are made up of a double helix of snakes.

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:16.800
And you know, they say that creatures came from the dog star, Sirius, to tell them this.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:20.000
First of all, we talked about that whole thing in a Project Camelot episode.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Yes, we did.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
That's an issue.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Yeah.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
That's something he should think about.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.580
Second, if Alex believes that these aliens came down and told these, or these people

01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:32.320
did get this information that they couldn't possibly have from any other source, then

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:36.560
that would imply that it isn't just what the globalists believe.

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.560
Well.

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:39.000
The globalists believe it because it's true.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.640
Well, hold on.

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:47.240
And then they make the movie, you know, the new Alien movies all about it.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:50.040
They are telling you all of this, okay?

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:58.040
And so they got a transmission, they built it, and it says, kill everybody and I'll give

01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.920
you the final codes.

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:03.320
Now, you know Satan's a deceiver.

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.240
Do you?

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:10.080
And so obviously they're not going to be given, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates are not going to

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:12.080
be given eternal life.

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:17.080
They're so, they're like ham radio operators, you know, getting transmission from Japan

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.080
or something.

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:23.580
They're like excited, you know, and they've gotten this information and that's really

01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.460
what this is.

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:30.600
Just like the Bible says, there is a fallen entity out of our sight, but another dimension

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:37.840
that we have free will, that we're more advanced than, but we're in a embryonic stage, a larval

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:43.760
stage, and if it can convince us to destroy ourselves, it will do it and take control

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:48.360
and have us build its escape mechanism.

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:49.920
And that's what this is.

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:50.920
Okay.

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:56.200
So the globalists believe that they're getting like promises from aliens who say you got

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.860
to kill everybody and then we'll give you the final codes.

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:02.700
And I'm, look, I know I sound crazy saying this, but that's just what they believe.

01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:08.460
Now I should tell you that they are getting these messages from a trans dimensional demon

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:11.680
that's in the Bible and that's what's going on.

01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:12.680
Well that's obvious.

01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:13.680
Yeah.

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:14.680
Okay.

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:15.680
Yeah.

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:17.640
That seems, I hate to be a dick.

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:18.640
What about it?

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:21.600
Seems kind of like a technicality.

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:27.200
It does seem like what he's saying is, what he's saying is they believe, I'm not crazy,

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:31.300
they believe that they're getting interdimensional messages.

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:32.560
When we all know it's a demon.

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:36.720
It's from the devil from a different dimension sending them messages.

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.720
What don't they understand?

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:38.720
Right.

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:39.720
It's completely different.

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.720
Now it might also be an alien.

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:42.720
Sure.

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:43.720
Ooh.

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:44.720
Yeah.

01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:45.720
This is silly.

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:47.320
And we all know Satan's a deceiver, Dan.

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:48.320
We do.

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.100
We all know Satan's a deceiver.

01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:52.680
That's taken as read.

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.360
So okay.

01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:57.440
So let's entertain this for one second.

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.760
Alright.

01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:00.780
Bezos, Gates.

01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:01.780
Not getting eternal life.

01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:07.400
Getting interdimensional messages that suggest to them that they will receive eternal life.

01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:08.400
Yes.

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:12.880
Now is a real issue that they just haven't talked to Alex yet and had Alex be like, nah,

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.760
nah, nah, nah, that's the devil.

01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:16.860
You're not actually going to get eternal life.

01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:18.280
They're lying to you.

01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:19.280
Hmm.

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:20.680
Is that all we need?

01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:23.000
We just need to get Bezos and Alex in a room together?

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
I think we do.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I think we don't.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
I think we should.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Nope.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.920
I think we should get him in a room together, put a big dome over it, and never open it

01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:31.920
again.

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:34.840
So it turns out you can talk to aliens or the devil.

01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:35.840
Sure.

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:36.840
In a lot of ways.

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:37.840
Yeah.

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:38.840
You could take drugs.

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:39.840
Okay.

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:40.840
You could electrocute yourself.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:41.840
Could just dream.

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:44.160
Alex later says you could just like do that thing where you choke yourself for kind of

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:45.160
a while.

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:46.160
Oh yeah.

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:47.160
I did that when I was young.

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:48.160
Yep.

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:51.560
So they're even getting everyone ready, okay?

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:57.000
And so it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, and you can electrocute yourself.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.520
You can have your heart stopped and do it.

01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.000
You can take DMT and do it.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.200
Put the trailer back up, I'm telling you, to break to the other side.

01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:09.320
And boy, when they do it, do they break through.

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:13.080
And in Buckaroo Banzai, the movie's telling you exactly what happens when he goes through

01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:16.480
the wall the other side, he don't come back the same dude.

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.480
Yeah.

01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:21.240
So apparently, Buckaroo Banzai, predictive programming about how you could commune with

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:22.320
the devil.

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:28.760
You know, I knew it was always going to come down to Robocop in one of his many roles,

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:31.440
but I didn't expect it to be Buckaroo Banzai.

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:33.480
That was too happy and joyful a film!

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:38.080
Well, turns out it also was full of very, very subtle messages about the devil.

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.080
Oh.

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:40.080
Well, that'll happen.

01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:41.080
Yep.

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:45.520
Also, you remember that episode where Alex was incoherent, fucked up on something, and

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:48.680
one of the questions from the Reddit AskManny thing was about Buckaroo Banzai, he's like,

01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:49.680
I've never seen it.

01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:50.680
Yeah.

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:52.280
He was being cagey.

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:57.800
He does not like revealing that he's a big nerd, which is so weird to me.

01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:59.920
Meanwhile, Buckaroo Banzai is real.

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:04.720
Is this like a there but for the grace of God, could I have been Alex Jones if I was

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:09.480
just so insecure about my nerdiness when I was in like fourth grade?

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:10.480
No.

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:11.480
Is that all it took?

01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:12.680
No, because I think you probably were.

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:16.900
I think it would also require an inability to understand the things you were reading.

01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:17.900
There is that.

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:21.920
That's such an essential piece of what makes Alex Alex.

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:22.920
Yeah.

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:23.920
Like a lack of reading comprehension.

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:26.720
Just an inability to comprehend what you read.

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:27.720
Yeah.

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:33.880
Mixed with a pretty high-functioning memory, a recall, a pretty strong recall.

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.120
Yeah, totally.

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:38.120
But just not a good understanding.

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:39.120
No.

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:44.760
And, I mean, don't get me wrong, also being really insecure about being a nerd.

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:45.760
Yeah, totally.

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:46.760
There's definitely that.

01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:47.760
That as well.

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.160
I'm not really a big Star Wars fan.

01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:50.400
Anyways, let me start my show.

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:51.400
Bom, bom, bom.

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:52.400
Neighbors.

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:53.400
Sorry.

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:54.400
Can't do the Imperial March.

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.400
Sorry.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.400
Just as bad as yelling Nazis.

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:57.840
I just screamed Nazis and now I'm playing the Imperial March.

01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:58.840
That's trouble.

01:33:58.840 --> 01:33:59.840
Stop it.

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:00.840
That's neighbor's trouble.

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:04.680
So Alex has a plug here and this made me pretty sad.

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:06.200
I didn't plug last hour.

01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:09.680
Speaking of last show, if I don't plug, we won't be here.

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.360
I am spending all the money we've got.

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:17.880
I have expended much of our reserves going to Georgia and going to Arizona and going

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.000
to DC.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.700
What a series of great investments.

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:30.080
Really got the achieved results out of Georgia, Arizona, DC, caravan.

01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.440
Really set the world on fire with that caravan.

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.540
We're still hearing about it.

01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:38.320
The ripples of the caravan.

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.920
The stop the steal caravan.

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:43.840
I mean, it's changed the political landscape.

01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:50.680
I'm going to say, I think pretty seriously, this will be maybe one of the few times Dan

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:58.000
where you have absolutely, like the caravanity project will live on forever.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.560
Long after the caravan has been forgotten.

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:00.560
I don't believe that.

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.560
I think you've done it.

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:02.560
I think you've done it.

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.560
You've immortalized something.

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.520
I got a phone call.

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:07.520
Right?

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:08.520
Okay.

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:13.960
Lieutenant Colonel, I can't say his name, but I promised I wouldn't.

01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:19.000
He was telling me that he talked to Gavin Newsom and people on the West coast, the high

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.580
elites, the biggest figures in West coast politics.

01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:28.080
They're terrified that they're going to do another caravan.

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:29.080
That's trouble.

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:30.080
That's trouble.

01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.080
Head West.

01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:32.080
That is trouble.

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:34.760
I can see Feinstein's bones jiggling.

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:40.000
They're so afraid that Owen is going to draw crowds of tens of people.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.080
Not to the West!

01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:47.120
They'll get all the way to Nevada.

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:51.600
I mean, look, I don't believe that this is necessarily going to be what happens, but

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:57.380
I do think that there would be a certain cosmic hilarity if Alex ends up going broke because

01:35:57.380 --> 01:35:58.380
of this bad investment.

01:35:58.380 --> 01:35:59.380
It'd be so great.

01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:00.380
It'd be so great.

01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:04.220
Look, we could have stayed on air another year, but I thought it was a good idea to

01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:07.440
send Owen to Baton Rouge.

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.840
I want the armored car to take him down.

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:13.840
I want that to be the thing.

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:15.560
He's going to be living out of that armored car.

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.880
That's such every bad boss that I've ever known.

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:20.960
Hey, I know what it said that I got a bunker going.

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.960
It's actually just this tank.

01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:25.080
I got a bunch of beans in the tank.

01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:31.200
Every bad boss I've ever known has been just like that where it's like, guys, unfortunately

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:34.480
we're only going to be able to do a small raise this year.

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:35.840
It's just going to be a 2%.

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.200
Anyways, I bought an armored van!

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.200
Weee!

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.700
We're going to fucking Florida!

01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:43.440
Like fuck off.

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.360
You guys are the worst.

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:47.640
So Alex has a guest on, which I thought was weird.

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:49.760
I was like, hey, it's your last show.

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:52.120
Do your fucking last show.

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:57.200
Don't have guests on unless it's Steve because he belongs on your last show.

01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.800
He has ruined your life.

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:01.800
He deserves to be there at the end.

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:06.280
He needs to be wearing a black robe over like behind him with a scythe.

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.280
Yeah.

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:08.280
Uh, no, it's not.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:09.280
It's not Steve.

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:11.640
Dr. Patrick M. Byrne is on with us.

01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:13.840
I'm not going to go over his whole giant bio.

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:16.360
He started a lot of big companies.

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:18.560
Uh, I'm not going to again, list them all.

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:23.600
He was the CEO of Overstock and started that or runs worldstock.com was the first major

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:26.280
online site to accept Bitcoin.

01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:31.480
So yeah, this Patrick Byrne, he was the CEO of Overstock until he had to resign after

01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:36.120
it came out that he had an intimate relationship with Maria Butina, the Russian woman who pled

01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:39.800
guilty to conspiracy to act as a unregistered foreign agent.

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:40.800
Yeah.

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:43.800
And he had to resign because of that?

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:45.960
Yeah, he was mixed up in some shit.

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:49.240
After that, he had a bit of a public meltdown and said that the FBI forced him to have a

01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:54.040
relationship with her and he made a button and we had a string of nonsensical interviews.

01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:55.040
I like that swing.

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.040
Yeah.

01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.040
That's what I like about Patrick Byrne.

01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:02.640
Um, he's on just pushing the same sort of dominion conspiracies and also one thing that

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:10.520
I find very interesting is that if he's to be believed, he's feeding information to Rudy

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:13.140
Giuliani and Sidney Powell.

01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:17.080
So the information that they're putting out, he's taking credit for.

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:18.080
Okay.

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:24.760
So you're telling me that somebody who lost his insanely, perhaps obscenely high paying

01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:32.000
job, because of having an illicit affair with a foreign agent unregistered, is now telling

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:38.820
me several years later, I'm feeding information to Rudy Giuliani, someone who never ever had

01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:41.560
any connection to any sort of Russian intelligence whatsoever.

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:42.560
Correct?

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:47.060
Well, here's the problem, like everyone's just full of shit and so I don't know if I

01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:48.060
believe that.

01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:49.520
Oh, I don't believe him at all.

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:51.720
I'm just saying that that's a pattern of behavior.

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:54.520
If true, not great.

01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:55.520
Cool.

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:56.520
And it's not a good interview either.

01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:02.520
I don't really care because Alex has another guest on and maybe this is somebody who should

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:06.280
be on his last show, but come the fuck on.

01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:11.960
Joining us for the next hour and 15 minutes ahead of Joel Skousen is the one, the only

01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:12.960
David Eich.

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:15.640
The turd in the punch bowl himself.

01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:21.100
The guy who earlier on in his career, Alex would say is meant to make conspiracy thinkers

01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:25.840
and people who ask questions, give him a bad name, make them look bad because he talks

01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:31.920
about lizards and shape-shifting folks and blood drinking and oh wait, I'm that now.

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:32.920
Yep.

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:33.920
I...

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:38.560
There's something actually kind of spiritually appropriate about the idea that on his last

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:42.960
show he's sitting here and just like kissing David Eich's ass.

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:43.960
Exactly!

01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:49.360
I would want more of like a reconciliation, like a behind the music reconciliation at

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:53.160
the end, you know, where they're both sitting there like, you know, we disagreed about a

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:58.200
lot of stuff, but now I can see I'm also full of shit too.

01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:59.600
I think that there's two things.

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:10.040
One, I would like to see a bringing back of people like Jason Burmas and like Luke Rudowski.

01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:14.440
These people from way back when and just seeing how they get along now.

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.440
Yeah, that'd be great.

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:16.440
That would be a good last show.

01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:17.440
That'd be great.

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:22.180
I also think that this is really good too because like Alex resented David Eich for

01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:23.180
a long time.

01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:24.180
Totally.

01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:25.180
Totally.

01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:29.760
David Eich did not give a single fuck and just did his thing and I'm not saying like

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:30.760
that's a good thing.

01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:31.760
It's still a bad thing.

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:32.760
No, it was terrible.

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.800
But David Eich did his thing and didn't bend.

01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:36.800
He outlived him.

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:37.800
Yeah.

01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:38.800
Yeah.

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:43.080
And from the beginning to the end, I mean this isn't the last episode obviously, Alex

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:44.080
had a show on Wednesday.

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.080
Of course, of course.

01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:46.080
Of course.

01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:52.800
And to the hypothetical last show, David Eich stands as a more successful, more popular,

01:40:52.800 --> 01:41:00.580
better situated figure in the conspiracy world than Alex could ever be and Alex has now been

01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:01.580
brought low.

01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:03.120
He has had to bend.

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.120
That's brutal.

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:07.080
He had to bend the knee to someone like David Eich.

01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:11.560
Ooh, here's my pitch on Alex's actual last episode.

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:16.960
We actually, we full on do a, this is your life, right, where you have to hear the voice

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:20.920
disembodied before you know who it is that's coming on there.

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:26.720
I want to get so many different voices just to see how much he flinches, like hearing

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.320
his former friend's voice just being like, oh shit, he's coming for me.

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:31.320
What's happening?

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:32.320
Oh God, he's behind me.

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:33.320
Oh no.

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.320
I want to hear it.

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:35.320
Like, you know, those were always very positive.

01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:37.160
We're like, oh my God, it's him who's talking to me.

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:38.360
This would be very dark.

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:45.280
You know what'd be great is if Rapaport was a master of impressions and he could do like

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:50.000
the voices of people who hate Alex now, like Webster Tarpley or something.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Sure, sure.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
And then he's like, oh no, Webster, is that you?

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.760
Nope, it's just me, it's Rapaport, I'm fucking with you.

01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:56.160
It's still me, I'm in the bushes.

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.160
Yeah.

01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:00.080
We're on voice number 15, Alex, you should assume by now it's me.

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:04.620
Oh God, I love you, Rapaport, that you scared me, you had me scared there.

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:05.620
Every time.

01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:10.240
Anyway, David Icke is here and basically what his big thing is, is, hey man, there's

01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:11.240
no COVID.

01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:12.240
Yeah, of course.

01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:15.360
I've said since March, there is no virus.

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:20.840
And I've got more and more and more certain of that with every passing week.

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:27.160
But even if you believe there is, on the basis of their, even their manipulated figures,

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:35.480
which I say 100% manipulated, there is no deadly virus that affects the vast majority

01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:36.480
of people.

01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:37.480
The overwhelming vast majority of people.

01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:38.480
And yet...

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:40.960
Let me stop you, we've got to go to break and I'll give you the floor, man, you're so

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:41.960
on target.

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:48.720
Okay, that's not the response you're supposed to have to David Icke coming on and saying

01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:54.120
that there is no virus, I've been convinced of this the whole time, but let's stipulate

01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:59.880
that there is, just in case some of your listeners aren't ready for the truth that there is no

01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:02.320
virus.

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:07.640
That's fitting for the last show, for Alex to have a guest who's saying things that directly

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:13.080
contradict literally everything that he believes, and him being like, you're so on target.

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:15.100
You got it, nailed it, buddy.

01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:16.100
You're the best.

01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:21.420
We have one last clip here of David Icke from the final episode of the Alex Jones show.

01:43:21.420 --> 01:43:24.600
It's just, go fuck yourself, David Icke.

01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:29.720
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has never been isolated and shown to exist, simple, simple fact.

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:35.900
There's no scientific paper on planet earth that's appeared since it's apparently started

01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:42.840
in China that has shown the virus to exist through isolating it and isolating its genetic

01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:43.840
code.

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:47.600
This is absolutely not true, and David Icke should be absolutely ashamed of himself for

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:48.960
passing along this bullshit.

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:50.360
I bet he's not.

01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:54.780
There's an article in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases from June 2020 with the

01:43:54.780 --> 01:44:00.960
title, quote, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from patient with coronavirus

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:02.680
disease United States.

01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:08.920
I'll read you this from the abstract, quote, we isolated virus from nasopharyngeal and

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:14.020
oropharyngeal specimens from the patient and characterized the viral sequence replication

01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:18.400
process and cell culture tropism.

01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:19.400
Isolated virus.

01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:20.400
Yeah.

01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:22.980
This paper actually even discusses how they were able to take this isolated virus and

01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:27.360
create a full genome sequence, which they made, quote, available to the domestic and

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:31.520
international public health, academic and pharmaceutical sectors for basic research,

01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:35.360
diagnostic development, antiviral testing and vaccine development.

01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:39.200
David Icke actually goes on to bring up this study, which contradicts his point that there

01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:40.880
is no paper that shows this.

01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:41.880
Wild.

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:45.000
It's not a problem for him though, because he then claims this paper is bogus, citing

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:50.480
the expertise of a guy named Tom Cowen, who's put out a video about how 5G is poisoning

01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:52.600
our cells, which is creating viruses.

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:53.600
Oh, great.

01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:58.560
Also, Cowen is a holistic medicine guy whose medical license is currently on probation

01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:03.320
because quote, among other things, he had offered an unlicensed drug to a breast cancer

01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:07.000
patient without informing her it wasn't approved for use.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.280
He also never saw the patient in person, nor did he review her full medical file, according

01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:16.700
to documents from the Medical Board of California detailing why he was to be disciplined.

01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:18.520
So I'm not going to listen to this dude.

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:22.880
Anyway, go fuck yourself, David Icke, you're a real pile of shit, and it's fitting that

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:26.300
Alex would have you as a guest on your last show.

01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:32.880
On a scale of one to five Hitler mustaches, two.

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:33.880
Two mustaches?

01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:37.160
I think that's too, uh, probably, yeah, probably too low.

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:41.760
I think a lot of, yeah, but one Hitler mustache is still one.

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:42.760
Too many.

01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:45.720
I mean, it's really about how you look at the scale.

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:50.120
You know, like, that's one of those things, there are limits.

01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:57.160
I don't see how saying on a show right now that the virus isn't real is any different

01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:59.320
from yelling fire in a crowded theater.

01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:00.320
Sure.

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:01.320
You know?

01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:02.320
Like, that's just the reality of the situation.

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:05.880
There's no difference, you're killing people.

01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:08.800
Yeah.

01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:16.440
I agree with you, except for, I don't know, just the ability to make direct lines.

01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:21.440
If you yell fire in a crowded building, obviously you see the immediate effects of it, whereas

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:29.320
this is so, it's much harder to trace direct people who were affected, and this is the

01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:31.640
reason that they behaved in the way they did.

01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:32.640
But I agree with you.

01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:34.320
You can't contract trace bullshit.

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:37.400
I agree with you in concept, though.

01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:40.760
I don't know what the answer to that is.

01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:41.760
I hate it.

01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:42.760
I think it sucks.

01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:43.760
Murder hornets.

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:44.760
Murder hornets?

01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:45.760
Yep.

01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:46.760
How about this?

01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:47.760
Okay.

01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:48.760
Daleks.

01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:50.920
I like it.

01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:53.200
What would we put in our Dalek compartments?

01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:54.200
Hornets.

01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:56.720
Okay, take this swab.

01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:58.440
Didn't take the swab?

01:46:58.440 --> 01:46:59.960
Release murder hornets.

01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:00.960
Yeah, exactly.

01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:06.440
It'd be so weird if it was just like, alright, take this swab.

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:07.440
No I won't.

01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:08.440
Boop.

01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:09.440
What comes out?

01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:10.440
Cake.

01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:11.440
What?

01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:12.440
Folger.

01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:13.440
What the fuck?

01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:14.440
Thank you, Dalek.

01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:15.440
Ah, but the cake is a bomb.

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:16.440
Shit.

01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:17.440
Damn it.

01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:18.440
Yeah, so I don't know.

01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:24.080
I gotta say, I admire Alex for doing his last show.

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:26.000
He said he was going to do it.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Sure.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.440
I don't admire what he did, though.

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:32.600
Again, I think we're running into this a lot.

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:34.760
We could do this better than him.

01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:40.640
If you have this opportunity to do your last show, don't just do your show.

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:46.200
Don't talk to Patrick Byrne about Dominion conspiracies that'll be stale tomorrow.

01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:52.080
Don't do an interview with David Icke where it just becomes transparently clear how much

01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:56.080
you've betrayed your own beliefs in your career.

01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:59.160
Do something that is like...

01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:00.160
Retrospect it.

01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:04.600
I honestly think just revisiting Endgame would have been amazing.

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:05.600
Probably.

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:06.600
That would have been amazing.

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:07.600
That really would have.

01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:09.320
He would have been so confused by some of the theories that he had.

01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:10.880
He wouldn't remember half of it.

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:11.880
That would have been great.

01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:13.160
And you know he wouldn't have prepared.

01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:14.160
No.

01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:15.720
He would think that he knew everything about his film.

01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:16.720
Totally.

01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:19.320
And then he'd realize he has no idea what he was making that movie about.

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:21.760
Back in the booth, pull up the bibliography on this.

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.760
What?

01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:23.760
Fill in later?

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:25.480
Why didn't people fill this in?

01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:26.480
What the fuck?

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:27.880
Can you even do that?

01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:28.880
Wait a second.

01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:30.360
I can't pull up this Encarta page.

01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:32.040
What the fuck is going on?

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:34.320
Somebody get that Encarta disc from way back in my house.

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:35.720
Or maybe this bibliography sucks.

01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:36.720
Oh wait it was me.

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:37.720
Oh shit.

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:38.720
Yeah.

01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:44.600
I would be interested in something like that or even blowin' hard for a couple hours just

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:49.640
about like the Northern Lights.

01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:56.120
Yeah, yeah, full on three hours of esoteric Alex tossing out all kinds of theories about

01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:57.120
all kinds of shit.

01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:00.520
It needs to be something that can live as a document.

01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:05.680
You know, if you're doing this and it's something you clearly have talked about doing as an

01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:11.540
idea for a long time and you say the day before, I'm finally going to do this thing, this last

01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:16.040
episode, this hypothetical last episode, it's gotta be a concept episode.

01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:17.040
And it just wasn't.

01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:18.040
No.

01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:19.040
It just wasn't.

01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:20.040
It was flat.

01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:21.040
The guests were terrible.

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:23.120
This stuff's embarrassing.

01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:30.160
If it's to be remembered as his last episode, he's getting shit wrong all over the place.

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:32.920
His big message is the left are chumps.

01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:33.920
Sure.

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:34.920
Great.

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:35.920
Great.

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:39.840
He's talking about how if you go to a hospital for COVID, Antifa will murder you in their

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:41.040
murder docs.

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:42.440
That's going to stand the test of time.

01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:48.960
He's rambling about plannedopolis, which is already, again, it's a conspiracy that's stale

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:50.920
almost as soon as it comes out of his mouth.

01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:51.920
It's pointless.

01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:53.920
Oh, the obvious thing that his last show should be.

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:55.160
What's that?

01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:57.480
Just a movie roundup.

01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:01.700
All the movies that he has based all of his bullshit on.

01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:04.040
He just starts playing clips, man.

01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:08.440
He does a full on clip show of like, hey, you remember this conspiracy theory?

01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:09.440
This one's from Oblivion.

01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:10.440
All right.

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:11.440
All right.

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:12.440
Now let's move on to this next one.

01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:13.440
Hey, you remember this one?

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:14.440
Logan's Run.

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:15.440
You guys ever see that?

01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:16.440
That's a classic.

01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:17.680
But he does do that as he does it.

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:19.280
I mean, you heard about the Buckaroo Banzai.

01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:20.280
Sure.

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:21.280
Sure.

01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:22.280
Totally.

01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:23.280
But I'm talking about comprehensive.

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.280
Do the whole filmography.

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:25.840
Turn it into AMC.

01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:31.960
Also, let me just say, dangerous message to send on your show that you can talk to demons

01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:35.760
or aliens if you electrocute yourself, because what if somebody listening wants to talk to

01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:36.760
those aliens?

01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:37.760
Well, that's true.

01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:39.160
What if people listening end up electrocuting themselves?

01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:42.760
It never occurred to me that I should try any of those things.

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:43.760
Well, now.

01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:46.120
But now I obviously need to.

01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:47.320
Yeah.

01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:49.560
I give this two thumbs down.

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:54.400
Again, like the caravan, it's just another thing that gets me so fucking excited.

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.400
I know.

01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:56.400
It's such a bust.

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:57.400
I know.

01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:58.400
It's such a letdown.

01:50:58.400 --> 01:50:59.400
I know.

01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:08.600
Alex cannot help but be disappointing, but I should say I'm back to where I like to be,

01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:11.120
which is I'm ready to be disappointed consistently.

01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:12.120
Sure.

01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:13.120
Sure.

01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:16.640
There was a stretch where I was very much just like, it's getting tiresome that I'm

01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:18.600
being disappointed over and over again.

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:19.600
Yeah.

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:24.200
Now there's a bit more charm to it.

01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:27.400
I can't help but think that it's all just because I'm building things up again.

01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:35.640
I have a theory that some of that is about your excitement is both yours and also anticipation

01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:38.240
of the excitement of you telling it to me.

01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:43.080
Because even now I can see it in your eyes when you were getting excited about the feeling

01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:46.240
you had whenever he was like, I'm going to do my last show tomorrow.

01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:49.560
I saw it in your eyes in the moment.

01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:53.920
Well, mostly because you immediately could tell that that was-

01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:54.920
Oh, well, yeah.

01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:55.920
Obviously.

01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:56.920
What I was excited about.

01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:02.160
I feel like, yeah, there's some anticipation to that, sure.

01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:03.160
You know?

01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:04.160
Yeah.

01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:05.160
Daleks with guns.

01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:06.160
Still good.

01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:09.840
Anyway, I mean, I guess our show is over too now.

01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:11.480
Alex has done his last show.

01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:16.800
You think those cops would begin to view the Dalek as a partner, you know?

01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:23.120
If I understand anything from globalist texts, and by that I mean short circuit-

01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:24.120
Sure.

01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:25.120
Yes.

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:26.120
Okay.

01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:27.120
Yeah.

01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:28.120
Yeah.

01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:29.120
For sure.

01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:32.240
And there's also a lot of blatant racism in that too.

01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:33.240
WALL-E.

01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:35.360
Globalist document WALL-E.

01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:36.360
Sure.

01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:37.360
Sure.

01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:38.360
Yeah, I don't know.

01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:40.960
Anyway, we'll be back because our show isn't over and neither is Alex's.

01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:41.960
Of course not.

01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:45.680
This is all just dumb bullshit on his part trying to get attention, but he had to do

01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:46.680
it eventually.

01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:47.680
You know what I'd love?

01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:48.680
What?

01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:54.120
I'd love to do it on Wednesday because holiday and such, but I would love if today's show

01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:55.120
on Wednesday.

01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:57.640
I do know that he did one, but I haven't listened to it.

01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:03.240
I would love if it started, yesterday I tried to do my last episode, I really fucking punted.

01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:04.240
I screwed up.

01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:07.360
I'm going to do my real last episode today.

01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:08.360
That would be great.

01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:10.840
I would give anything for him to do a whole week of that.

01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:11.840
Yeah.

01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:12.840
Each time just being like, fucked up.

01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:15.920
Each time, look, last time I thought I did better, but you know what?

01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:16.920
Third time's the charm.

01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:20.400
I realized in hindsight it was embarrassing to have David Icahn for an hour and then kiss

01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:25.320
his ass on the last show and I should, by all accounts, think he's a total weirdo.

01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:26.320
Yeah.

01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:28.360
Hey, we're going to do this again.

01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:31.360
Also, Steve China complained that he didn't get booked.

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:32.360
Yeah.

01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:36.840
Like an aspiring comic, he got mad that he didn't get the call.

01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:39.220
So we're going to do it from the top.

01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:40.720
It is fitting if this is his last episode.

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:43.440
Also, boy, Rob Dues got to feel bad that he wasn't on the last show.

01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:45.560
Yeah, Rob Dues doesn't need to be on the last show.

01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:46.560
You got to.

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:47.560
Yeah, come on.

01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:48.560
He's been there forever.

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:49.560
Ah, come on.

01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:50.560
Yeah.

01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:51.560
Anyway, we'll be back.

01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:52.560
Indeed, we will.

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:53.560
But until then, we have a website.

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:54.560
We do have a website.

01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:55.560
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:56.560
Yep.

01:53:56.560 --> 01:53:57.560
We're also on Twitter.

01:53:57.560 --> 01:53:58.560
We are on Twitter.

01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:00.920
It's at knowledge underscore fight and at go to bed Jordan.

01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:01.920
We're also on Facebook.

01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:02.920
We are on Facebook.

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:06.480
If you'd like to tell us your iTunes, if you could, please find a local charity or bail

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:09.640
fund in your area to help out people doing God's work right now.

01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:10.680
We will be back.

01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:14.760
But until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX Clark, I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:17.720
I am a surf, not a Smurf.

01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:18.720
Andy in Kansas.

01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:19.720
You're on the air.

01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:20.720
Thanks for holding.

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:21.720
Hello, Alex.

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:22.720
I'm a first time caller.

01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:23.720
I'm a huge fan.

01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:24.720
I love your work.

01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:51.680
I love you.
