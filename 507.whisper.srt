00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,080
Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am SWEATING

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,280
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,880
I have great respect for Knowledgefight

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,160
Knowledgefight

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,400
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,040
Shang, we are the bad guys, Knowledgefight

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,200
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,000
Rattle her, rattle her, rattle her

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,360
Need, I need money, rattle her, rattle her

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,200
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,720
Stop it, Andy and Kan, Andy and Kansas

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,120
Andy and, Andy and, it's time to pray

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,440
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,760
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,000
I love your work

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,840
Knowledgefight

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,480
N-N-N-N-N-Knowledgefight.com

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,280
I love you

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,400
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:01,960
I'm Jordan

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,080
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,800
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,080
Oh indeed we are Dan

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,440
Jordan

26
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:07,920
Dan!

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,560
Jordan

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,440
I have a quick question for you

29
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:09,840
What's up?

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,600
What's your bright spot today?

31
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,040
My bright spot today, Jordan, is just a nice sort of glow

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,160
the post-holiday glow of having, we got to spend a little time

33
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,080
Oh yeah, indeed

34
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,160
the live stream put on by Cognitive Dissonance

35
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,760
It was great, raised a lot of money

36
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,320
That was awesome, congratulations

37
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,840
Yeah, it was really a great time, a lot of fun to chat with them

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:42,160
and to be overwhelmed, quite frankly, by the support of people donating to the Senate campaign

39
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,400
Quite crazy, honestly

40
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:49,160
And I started to reflect on it, I'm like, we did a terrible job of promoting this

41
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,160
I think there's some tweets and stuff, but we forgot to mention it on our last episode

42
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,960
because we recorded it in advance

43
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,120
It's too early, it's too early, it was a day early

44
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,520
We can't promote something more than a day in advance

45
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,640
Two days in the future doesn't exist in my bright spot

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,040
It doesn't exist for us

47
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,960
But yeah, it was nice to be invited, it was nice to be along for the ride on that

48
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,640
It was fantastic

49
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,960
How about you, what's your bright spot?

50
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,200
My bright spot, Dan, aside from us having a lovely holiday together

51
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,000
playing some board games and the like

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,080
You introduced me to ham

53
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,120
I did introduce you to ham, I cooked you a ten pound ham, Dan

54
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,080
Well, I didn't eat all of it

55
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,880
We ate less than two pounds of that ham

56
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,880
I come from a non-ham family, and so I have not experienced really like a ham steak

57
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,080
or like a slice of ham

58
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,840
Marinated in a little maple syrup, did all kinds of fun stuff

59
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,440
I couldn't really taste the maple syrup

60
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,040
Nope, I'm not good at cooking ham

61
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,920
But it was very nice, very, very delightful

62
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,480
It was a great, great holiday, but in order to tell you what my actual bright spot is, Dan

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,600
I'm gonna have to open up my correspondence cage

64
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,400
Just to be clear, we didn't have a big gathering or anything

65
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,960
We didn't, no

66
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,520
In case people are thinking that we had like a Thanksgiving party

67
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,320
It was the two of us

68
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:01,820
Yeah

69
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,480
As always

70
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah

71
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,720
Just in case people are thinking, ah, you're flouting COVID

72
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're all, oh yes, me and-

73
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,560
Very careful, very careful

74
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,080
It was very, very small

75
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,880
I'm sorry, but go ahead

76
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,520
No problem

77
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,920
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and open up my correspondence cage over here, Dan

78
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,420
Click

79
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:27,000
And a new raptor princess, Kranat, created a cover for my book

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,480
Oh, that's great

81
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,320
Made a graphic design that is not just a great cover and a great design, but like really perfect

82
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,880
Uh-huh

83
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,520
It made me feel seen

84
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,800
It was really, really cool

85
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,120
I did see the design and it looks fantastic

86
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,320
It looks fantastic

87
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,800
And so that's awesome

88
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,280
Yes

89
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,960
I'm really happy for you and that's a really awesome piece of work to have been created

90
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,640
I have some issues with your correspondence cage

91
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,360
What about it?

92
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,320
Not a fan

93
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,240
What, what, what, don't you like about it?

94
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,760
Second, I have another problem

95
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,360
Was to open the lock

96
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,080
No, I got the sound effect

97
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,880
Click, yeah

98
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,720
I have another problem and that is you're naming someone a raptor princess

99
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,120
Yes

100
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,680
And you're not telling me in advance, so I don't have the clip here

101
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,240
I don't know

102
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,880
I don't have the drop

103
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,160
I can't just tell you to play a raptor princess clip

104
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,560
I feel like that's something that you have to also choose to do

105
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,640
Well, see, this is what we really need to talk about

106
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,640
And that is you should have made your own drop

107
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,080
Yes, I should have made my own drop

108
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,640
If you're naming someone a raptor princess, you need to come

109
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,240
If you're coming in with the correspondence cage sound effect

110
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,760
You really should have your own drop

111
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,800
I understand, you're right, I should have my own set of drops entirely

112
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,600
Uh-huh

113
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,080
Yes

114
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,280
I think that's a good idea

115
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,480
You really want to annoy me

116
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,600
If you really want to escalate this arms race of annoying each other, that is the way to go

117
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,760
That would be a great, that would be a great decision

118
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,280
So is that crannot, is that right?

119
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,960
Yes, crannot or craynot

120
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,440
Okay

121
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,240
Not sure the, it was a correspondence

122
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,280
And yeah, it's tough to know how vowels are long or short

123
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:54,760
Exactly

124
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,080
Yeah

125
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,200
On the page

126
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,760
Well, thank you

127
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,320
Yes, indeed

128
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,200
On, I know that this is a gift for Jordan, but I'll still thank you

129
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,720
I think it's pretty cool that that exists

130
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,600
Fantastic

131
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,000
So, Jordan, we got an interesting episode to go over today

132
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,640
Yes, we do

133
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,640
And we got a lot of, lot of bullshit, lot of, lot of business to get into

134
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,600
But before we do, uh, let's, uh, take a little moment say thank you

135
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,040
to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show

136
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,920
That's a great idea

137
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,400
So, first, paganfilthisdustin, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

Thanks very much, Kat!

159
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,240
And finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on an elevated level, we appreciate that very much.

160
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,040
So first, Elise Middlefart, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

161
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,240
And, ooh, tough one here, Donald Trump, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

162
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,640
I'm a policy wonk.

163
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew.

164
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,240
How's your 401k doing, bro?

165
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,040
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

166
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,240
Let's just get down to business.

167
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

168
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,040
Why are you pimps so good?

169
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
My neck is freakishly large.

170
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,640
I declare info war on you.

171
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,240
Thank you so much, Elise Middlefart, and thank you so much, Donald Trump.

172
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:49,240
Yes, quite a situation for him to be like, well, the only way to take down the GOP people who are betraying me is to donate to knowledge fights.

173
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Yeah, that'll do it.

174
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
That'll get him.

175
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,640
So, Jordan, today I found myself in a little bit of an interesting pickley conundrum.

176
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,240
Sure.

177
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,640
And that is that Thanksgiving happened and Alex was out of studio for the end of the week.

178
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,240
Sure.

179
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:11,240
And so in terms of us coming back with something from Alex's oeuvre seemed like it was gonna be a difficulty.

180
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
Owen Troyer was in studio filling in.

181
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,240
Ugh.

182
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,240
I guess we could have maybe forced something out of like Alex's little, you know, hey how you doing videos.

183
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,240
Sure, sure.

184
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
Standing in front of a lake yelling about something or other.

185
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,240
But I just wasn't interested.

186
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,240
And so I thought like now is the time we gotta get wacky.

187
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,240
It's a wacky Monday.

188
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,240
It's time.

189
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
It's been a while.

190
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:43,240
What we thankfully have is I think that Carrie Cassidy, Swery Carrie, over at Project Camelot has given up on her paywall format.

191
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:54,240
I don't know if that's because enough people were generous or if, I don't know what the deal is, but these videos are all very available and I've not had to log into anything to get them.

192
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
I think Carrie missed our episode.

193
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
It's possible.

194
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,240
I think Swery Carrie was like, if they're never gonna do an episode on me again, I better make these free.

195
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,240
She missed us.

196
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
She missed the thing we've got.

197
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,240
So I guess there are anybody, you know, who's sort of newer to the show.

198
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:19,240
Whenever we need to take a break from Alex Jones, we like to look into the world of Project Camelot, which is a YouTube channel run by a lady we call Swery Carrie who interviews space weirdos.

199
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Yep.

200
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Various super soldiers, people who have been to Mars, people who are psychics.

201
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
She is a psychic herself.

202
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Of course.

203
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
She hangs out with this guy named Mark Richards.

204
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
A little bit Pleiadian, but not a ton.

205
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
Well, maybe.

206
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Maybe.

207
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
It's debatable.

208
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Someone told her that who might be a racist alien.

209
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
He was definitely a racist alien.

210
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,240
And then he became Death.

211
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
That'll happen.

212
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
The Archangel Abaddon.

213
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,240
That's true.

214
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,240
There's a lot of lore here.

215
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Her main source of information, her big sort of whistleblower is this guy named Mark Richards who is a murderer who was framed for murder because he was off planet at the time.

216
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
Well.

217
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
He was a sentient spaceship Minerva.

218
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Indeed.

219
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
And his friends in the raptor beings.

220
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
Right.

221
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Right, right, right.

222
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Doing a mission of some sort.

223
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Just to be clear, we didn't make this up.

224
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
Nope.

225
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
This is stuff we've learned.

226
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
This is stuff we've learned.

227
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
We've observed this in the wild.

228
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Yeah.

229
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,240
So, unfortunately over the time that we have looked at this, it was supposed to be just a pressure release valve.

230
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,240
Of course.

231
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,240
We've come to realize that Carrie is also very into QAnon.

232
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,240
They are dovetailing together our two shows.

233
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,240
And that kind of took a little bit of the charm away from it.

234
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,240
But, sometimes you still just need a hit.

235
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
You gotta go to the well.

236
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Yeah.

237
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,240
So today, Jordan, we're going to be looking at a video that was released on Project Camelot on November 12th.

238
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
Which is a little bit of an election Q&A.

239
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Okay.

240
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Post-election Q&A.

241
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Alright.

242
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Okay.

243
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
You probably have some Q's.

244
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I got some Q's.

245
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
Carrie's got some A's.

246
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Out of CVAs.

247
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Here's her introduction.

248
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
Hi everyone.

249
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
I'm Carrie Cassidy from Project Camelot.

250
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Hi Carrie.

251
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
So, very happy to be here today.

252
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
But my guest didn't show up.

253
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,240
So, I guess she had some conflict or other and we'll have to reschedule.

254
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
I'm not sure what's going on there.

255
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:14,240
Anyway, so, I just thought I'd do a Q&A if that's useful.

256
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
I love it.

257
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Now, I want to say that I do not think anything is bad about a guest canceling.

258
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
That shit happens.

259
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
No, no.

260
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

261
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:30,240
I only left that introduction in because it is the setup for a punchline later.

262
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,240
And I don't want to turn this show into a thing where you're yelling bingo all the time.

263
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
Okay, I'm not going to try and yell bingo all the time.

264
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,240
But I would like to see if you can figure out where the payoff to that joke is.

265
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Okay, alright.

266
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,240
I think you'll be able to figure it out.

267
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Is the guest that cancelled actually her?

268
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
No.

269
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Is this a Fight Club scenario?

270
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
No, no, no, no.

271
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
Alright.

272
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
But there is definitely something that's like, wait a second.

273
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,240
There's literally no way this guest should have ever cancelled.

274
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
You'll see once it happens.

275
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
Okay.

276
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Alright.

277
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
So, a Q&A would be nice.

278
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Certainly, like I said, you got Qs, Carrie's got As.

279
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Of course.

280
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
But it turns out this is even more than just a Q&A.

281
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,240
Alright.

282
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
This, what she started down this road.

283
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
A Q-Anon-Anay.

284
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Ooh.

285
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
There's a lot going on.

286
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:18,240
I can say that, in general, I did have a precog dream last night, finally, about the outcome

287
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
so far.

288
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,240
It's an interesting dream that I had.

289
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,240
So, maybe I'll just share that and then you can go ahead and ask questions about whatever.

290
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,240
So, when I hear a caller on the Alex Jones show talk about their dreams.

291
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
Yes.

292
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,240
Not interested.

293
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,240
Uh-uh.

294
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Boring.

295
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,240
When I hear Swery Carrie open up the show saying, I had a precognitive dream, finally,

296
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
about the election.

297
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Fire in my heart.

298
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
Fire in my heart.

299
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
I had a precog dream several days after the election, finally.

300
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
About what's going to happen here.

301
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
The election, yes.

302
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,240
And so, she gets into that right at the beginning, right at the top, and it turns out that she's

303
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,240
a good storyteller, because she sets the scene for what was going on before the dream.

304
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Sure, sure.

305
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
In order to give you some context.

306
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,240
She had spicy foods?

307
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
Maybe.

308
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,240
That might be the truth behind the words she's using, but I'll leave that to the Pleiadians

309
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,240
to know for sure.

310
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:21,240
So, my dream, basically, was, and I had a very, they were shooting a 5G at me last night,

311
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,240
so, I know Trump doesn't have complete control over scalar weapons that are being used, and

312
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
so on and so forth.

313
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:35,240
So, I was up most of the night, on and off, and then finally fell asleep, I think, around

314
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
6 or so AM.

315
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,240
So, I mean, look, she was having 5G shot at her.

316
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Scalar laser 5G attack.

317
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,240
No, I understand, and she was saying that, and I get that, fine, you were having 5G shot

318
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,240
at you, that's a happening.

319
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Sure.

320
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
How did she know?

321
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,240
Because she didn't say what the effects of having 5G shot at.

322
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
She has 5G sensors.

323
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,240
No, apparently, not being able to fall asleep is a sign of 5G attack.

324
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
That's it.

325
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,240
Well, I mean, I've certainly been someone who's struggled with insomnia at periods in

326
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,240
my life.

327
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Sure, sure.

328
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,240
A lot of times, I still, it takes me a long time to fall asleep.

329
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
It's frustrating.

330
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
It sucks.

331
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,240
I have friends who'd be like, I lay down, and two minutes later I'm out, and I get mad

332
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
at them.

333
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
I'm furious.

334
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,240
Because it'll take me an hour and a half, at least, usually, of just laying there to

335
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
fall asleep.

336
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,240
And it sucks, but if I could imagine that I was under 5G scalar attack, that'd probably

337
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
be more exciting.

338
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Or it might make it harder.

339
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
It would up the drama.

340
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,240
I feel like it would make it impossible to sleep.

341
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,240
Yeah, because then I'm like, oh no, 5G.

342
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Instead of going to bed at midnight and falling asleep at two, you fall asleep at six, and

343
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,740
you're worried about 5G attacks the whole time.

344
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,240
Yeah, maybe I'm glad I don't think this.

345
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
I think that's a good idea.

346
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Yeah.

347
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Now, the problem is, I've been outside your window with my phone pointed at you every

348
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
night, so that's why you've been having trouble sleeping.

349
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Does your phone have that app, the 5G shooting app?

350
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
It does.

351
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
Wow.

352
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,240
Well, it actually emerges from a compartment in my phone.

353
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
That's important.

354
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Yes.

355
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Your Dalek phone.

356
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
Yep.

357
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,240
So this is the setting of the dream, 5G attack all night.

358
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Of course.

359
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,240
And then she gets to sleep at around six in the morning, and here is part of the dream.

360
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:23,240
And then I had this dream in which I saw the television, and Trump had taken it over and

361
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:32,240
was showing, actually, individuals and indictments and individuals that had actually been killed

362
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:39,240
part of their indictments in, I guess, a military tribunal type of situation.

363
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,240
And it was all being announced to the entire public.

364
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:53,240
And I was very happy because these individuals were very dark and involved in hurting children

365
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,240
and the children in the underground bases, adrenochrome and all of that.

366
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
Sure.

367
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
Of course.

368
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
So that was the dream.

369
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,240
It was like a little movie.

370
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,240
It's quite a dream.

371
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
Quite a dream.

372
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Carrie's a...

373
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,240
If I were a dream analyst, if you will.

374
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,240
She's dreaming about stuff she's read on blogs.

375
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
I wouldn't go with precog.

376
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,240
I would go with, you've got some really violent fantasies, lady.

377
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Well, I think that she's tapping into the zeitgeist of a lot of the online extreme right.

378
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,240
Like, these are the sort of fantasies that get trafficked on message boards, and even

379
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
people like Alex engage in.

380
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:38,240
This idea of Trump righteously taking over and killing their enemies is what they desperately

381
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
want.

382
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Yeah.

383
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,240
You know, I get bloodthirst to a point, you know.

384
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,240
Somebody was, whatever nonsense somebody wrote in like the Atlantic or something where it's

385
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,240
like, but we don't want to see Trump dragged from the White House.

386
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,240
Are you talking about Friedersdorf again?

387
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
No, I'm not talking about Friedersdorf.

388
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,240
The American people don't want to see Trump taken away from the White House.

389
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
He needs to concede like an adult.

390
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,240
And part of me is just sitting there going like, no, I would like to see him dragged

391
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
out by his hair.

392
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
I would like to see him dragged through the streets.

393
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
That would be great.

394
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
That's a little bloodthirst.

395
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,240
I get it.

396
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
I get it.

397
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,240
I don't think it will, I don't think it's a good idea, actually.

398
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,240
I think the consequences of it are so much worse than whatever catharsis you get out

399
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
of it.

400
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Exactly, right?

401
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
I can have that second level of thought.

402
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,240
I don't have the like, nope, the end bloodthirst.

403
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
That's all I need.

404
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Yeah.

405
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,240
It's like, okay, let's imagine a scenario where Trump does take over broadcast television

406
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,240
and announces like he's killed all of his enemies.

407
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Like, what happens next?

408
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,240
What the fuck kind of world are we living in?

409
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,240
Where the president is just like, I've taken over all beads of communication.

410
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Well, just so you guys know, killed everybody.

411
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,240
I killed almost everybody.

412
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,240
Bill Gates got away on a white horse.

413
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
Too pale for me, guys.

414
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
Too pale for my blood.

415
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,240
So Carrie's talking real specifically about a person who has been killed in this dream.

416
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
Sure.

417
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
I'm not sure.

418
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,240
I'm looking, I'm scanning the chat right now, and I'm not sure what some of these questions

419
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
refer to.

420
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,240
If you're referring to my dream, the details were very visual.

421
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:21,240
So like I said, there was television on, I was seeing it, it was literally, the part

422
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:31,240
that it was on was a particular person who had been killed as part of the sort of, I

423
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:37,240
don't know, whatever you want to call it, indictments and certainly payback for his

424
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,240
crimes against humanity.

425
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
She doesn't say who?

426
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,240
She never says who?

427
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
No.

428
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
That's bullshit.

429
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,240
She had a dream, it was visual, so she saw the person.

430
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,240
Yeah, she had to have.

431
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
Conceivably.

432
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
And she knows that person's crimes.

433
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
Well, it's against humanity.

434
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
Yeah.

435
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,240
I would say that it's either gotta be Soros or Bill Gates, right?

436
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
I'm gonna go with Stelter all the way.

437
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
No, she doesn't hate Stelter nearly as much.

438
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,240
I think Stelter is in the dreams of all right-leaning people.

439
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
That's his power?

440
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,240
Yes, exactly.

441
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
That's his demon clown power?

442
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
Yeah, yeah, Stelter on 39th Street.

443
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
I don't think it's Stelter.

444
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Stelter on Elm Street.

445
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
I don't know, man.

446
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
I don't know.

447
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
Maybe it's not a human.

448
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Maybe it's a raptor.

449
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,240
It could be a raptor.

450
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Whoa.

451
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
What if it's an alien?

452
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Holy shit.

453
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,240
It has to be an alien wearing a human face, though.

454
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
It doesn't have to be.

455
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
Oh, that's a good point.

456
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Yeah, because once Trump takes over the TV news and talks about how he's killed all his

457
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240
enemies, it could be like, and some of them.

458
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,240
Ooh, man.

459
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Take it one level.

460
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Some of them are reptiles.

461
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Look, it's fucked up if all of a sudden we hear that Trump killed all of his enemies,

462
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,240
but if at the same time he finds out that aliens are real, and he's killed aliens,

463
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,240
and we've got intergalactic treaties going on.

464
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,240
But Ike is now my Surgeon General.

465
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,240
What?

466
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,240
Nobody else can handle these raptor surgeries.

467
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
Gee.

468
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,240
So anyway, this person that she's talking about has been killed already in the dream.

469
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
Sure.

470
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
But she won't say who it is, and it's really frustrating.

471
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,240
It was interesting because it was literally about the fact that they already killed the

472
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
person.

473
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,240
So that seems quite adventurous to come forward in that way.

474
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
It does.

475
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,240
But that, in theory, is the plan, and they have said that they have killed certain people,

476
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,240
or it has been put out there.

477
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,240
Now, Trump, of course, has not said this yet.

478
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:35,240
So this was an official report, and it was clear that he had commandeered a television

479
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,240
station or maybe, and took the internet down.

480
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,240
No, but it was an official report in the dream.

481
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,240
In the dream it was official.

482
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,240
I understand, but don't say official report in the dream.

483
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
Oh, so Trump took down the internet?

484
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
How fucking scary is this?

485
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
He just took it down.

486
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,240
How scary is this?

487
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,240
And how much does this fit all of your nightmare versions of what the Democrats are trying

488
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
to-

489
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
No, this is a fantasy fulfillment dream.

490
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Right.

491
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,240
Trump has taken down all of the internet, controls at least one TV station-

492
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
He's seized communications.

493
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
He's murdering people.

494
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,240
He's crippled your ability to communicate with your audiences and your communities.

495
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
And I'm so happy.

496
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
Great.

497
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,240
So this might've been a vision, this dream.

498
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,240
It might've been a dream, might've been a vision, probably a dream, probably a vision.

499
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:26,240
He says, or they say, the QAnon and so on and so forth, the philosophy behind it is

500
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
they want to show people.

501
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,240
So my last video I said, okay, fine, show us.

502
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,240
In other words, don't talk about showing us, show us.

503
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,240
I get the sense that there is a possibility that what she's trying to say is that her

504
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,240
dream was a vision that was granted by Q.

505
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,240
I am expecting something along those lines.

506
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:56,240
It sounds to me a little bit like there is a belief that Q can give you dreams.

507
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,240
How long can you wait on the whole-

508
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,240
For a vision from Q?

509
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
Well, not just that.

510
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,240
Well, I mean, obviously you can wait a long time for a vision from Q.

511
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:12,240
But, okay, she said last week, the philosophy behind Q is show people, which, bananas thing

512
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,240
to say about Q considering its track record.

513
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,240
But how are you still waiting?

514
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Does she think the dream, she thinks the dream is a response to her saying show me what's

515
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
going on.

516
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
Yes.

517
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
Oh my God, we're all going to die.

518
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Yeah.

519
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
And this is also two weeks ago, so this shit has not happened.

520
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Oh boy.

521
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
Happened yet.

522
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
I think she did it.

523
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,240
This sucks because, okay, you don't have to yell bingo because the bingo is going to be

524
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
in this clip.

525
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,240
Okay.

526
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
There's no other way for me to set this up without it being obvious.

527
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
All right.

528
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
Okay.

529
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
I gotcha.

530
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,240
I gotcha.

531
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,240
But afterwards, I'd like you to explain to me why this is the punchline to the joke of

532
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
the guest canceling.

533
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Okay.

534
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,240
My guest, who was supposed to be here, she is actually-

535
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,240
The gate of gates?

536
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:58,240
An interesting woman, and she considers herself something of a time traveler.

537
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,240
She is also involved in researching, I guess, CV.

538
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,240
I'm not going to say the name.

539
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,240
And her book is going to be about that.

540
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,240
So, hopefully, we can get her back.

541
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,240
She was on my show a few years ago.

542
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,240
So, why is it really fucked up that this guest missed the show?

543
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,240
Dan, if you are a time traveler, it seems like you would, at the very least, be able

544
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
to make plenty of things on time.

545
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,240
You would never miss an appointment if you're a time traveler.

546
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
It really doesn't seem...

547
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,240
I mean, maybe you can't use time travel for this kind of mundanity, you know?

548
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,240
She had to go to get her hair appointment.

549
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:46,240
I would suggest that if you're somebody who has power over time and space and can manipulate

550
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,240
it to whatever extent you can, to the point where people say that you fancy yourself a

551
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,240
time traveler, I think that time is something that's on your mind.

552
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:04,240
I think that punctuality is probably a priority for you, even if your talents are imaginary.

553
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,240
I think I take issue with something here.

554
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,240
I think I let it go by the first time, but can you fancy yourself a time traveler?

555
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Yeah.

556
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
You see, it seems like you either are or are not.

557
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,240
I fancy myself a man about town.

558
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,240
Now I understand that, but this is a little bit different.

559
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
How great did I never leave the apartment?

560
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,240
A man about town is very subjective.

561
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,240
Well, I also never leave the apartment, so I am not.

562
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,240
Do you leave this time?

563
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,240
No, I don't.

564
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,240
Okay, well then you are neither a man about town nor a time traveler.

565
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,240
Yeah, I think that your instinct to let that go is good because I don't know if you're

566
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,240
ever going to get to any further truth on it.

567
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
I like it.

568
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:49,240
Now, I will say that with this person who thinks they're time travel or who has a book

569
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,240
coming out about COVID, that book should have come out three years ago.

570
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,240
You would think, again, time travel being what it is.

571
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
Yeah.

572
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
Couldn't you have written a book to warn us about COVID?

573
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Exactly.

574
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,240
Yes.

575
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,240
And Carrie says that she was on the show a couple years ago.

576
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
When it would have made sense.

577
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,240
That episode had better been all about COVID.

578
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,240
Yeah, that would be a good one to go back and check if she was like, in three years

579
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,240
I'm going to write a book about this shit, but just so you know.

580
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,240
Otherwise, I have some questions.

581
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
Yeah.

582
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
We'll check in on that and see.

583
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,240
What are you time traveling to do?

584
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Have fun.

585
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Well, that is a good reason to time travel.

586
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
Yeah.

587
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,240
I mean, there's certain sporting events that, I mean, obviously the classic thing is like,

588
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
gamble on them.

589
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,240
Sure.

590
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,240
But if you could go watch some amazing moments from like-

591
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
Totally.

592
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,240
Just feel the catharsis of this crowd just freaking out.

593
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
Right, right, right.

594
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
That'd be kind of fun.

595
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,240
Yeah.

596
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,240
I don't know.

597
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
Watch Jesse Owens run.

598
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
Yeah.

599
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,240
That'd be great.

600
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
Shove it in Hitler's fucking face.

601
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
So this guest didn't show up.

602
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,240
Mm-hmm.

603
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
And they should have because they're time traveling.

604
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,240
But Kerry mentions another guest.

605
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Someone asks a question about Robert David Steele.

606
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Mm-hmm.

607
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,240
Who is, of course, a real weirdo.

608
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,240
He has a lot of irons and many fires.

609
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
True.

610
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
He-

611
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
Does not, however, fancy himself a time traveler.

612
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
No.

613
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,240
However, he was the guy who was on Alex Jones' show and talked about how the globalists are

614
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,240
kidnapping children and taking them to bases in space.

615
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
Yep.

616
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
And enslaving them.

617
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,240
And then Alex got mad that everybody thought he believed it because-

618
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,240
He said, yep.

619
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
I believe you.

620
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
You are correct 100%.

621
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,240
And then Robert David Steele did not get invited back on Alex's show.

622
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
I'm surprised.

623
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
But he comes around Project Camelot from time to time.

624
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
This clip is very confusing.

625
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,240
I'd like you to listen to this.

626
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,240
And I think we have a little bit more to this story about Robert David Steele.

627
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
Okay.

628
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
I'm very interested in what's going on in his life.

629
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
All right.

630
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:48,240
You know, I understand that Benjamin Fulford has come forward saying that Robert David

631
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,240
Steele should be the candidate.

632
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,240
You know, I actually haven't seen the post, but this is kind of outrageous.

633
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,240
This.

634
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,240
He is always working under the orders of the triad.

635
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,240
And I have one video going back.

636
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,240
But first of all, the original video I did with him where he states what happened to

637
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,240
him, where he was threatened, and so on, and had to basically.

638
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,240
I think if he wants to stay in Japan and stay alive, he has to do what they say.

639
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,240
So now he's coming out against Trump, strangely.

640
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,240
So apparently Robert David Steele has turned on Trump, which I didn't know about, mostly

641
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
because I don't care.

642
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
Right, right, right.

643
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,240
I'm not going to follow along with what he has to think.

644
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,240
Far more interestingly, he lives in Japan, and in order to stay alive, he has to do the

645
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
bidding of the triad.

646
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:45,240
See, now, I wrote that down, and I'm struggling to really comprehend this, so if I understand

647
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,240
correctly, let me read exactly what I wrote down.

648
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Works for the triad in Japan.

649
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Now, that's Robert who?

650
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
David Steele.

651
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
Robert David Steele.

652
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Former CIA agent, yeah.

653
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
I don't know if he was actually in the CIA.

654
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
I think that's just what he said.

655
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,240
Yeah.

656
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
Is that a move up for him?

657
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
Probably.

658
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
I don't know.

659
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
Look, dude, here's the thing.

660
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
I've listened to a lot of Project Camelot.

661
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
I don't know who the fuck the triad are.

662
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,240
I'm not sure.

663
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
Not sure.

664
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
This is a new wrinkle.

665
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
There's a triad.

666
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,240
She could have said Yakuza, but now there's a triad.

667
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
I think they're aliens.

668
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Right?

669
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,240
I mean, it's got to be a trio of aliens.

670
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,240
It has to be, well, I hope it's at least a trio.

671
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Otherwise, now we're in real trouble.

672
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Yeah, this is confusing.

673
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,240
I don't like this sort of late reveal of-

674
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,240
How long has he been in Japan?

675
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Look, every time I've ever seen him, he's been in the same study just inside.

676
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,240
He always is by Skype from places.

677
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,240
He's always in this very nice looking study.

678
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
Sure.

679
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
Wonderful wood shelves and tons of books.

680
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,240
Maybe he just got one of those backgrounds that's like a Shinto temple, and she's like,

681
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
oh, well, he obviously lives in Japan now.

682
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Oh, maybe.

683
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,240
I don't know, because I've also listened to Robert David Steele's interview with Carrie.

684
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
I don't know.

685
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,680
I haven't listened to all of them because I've done a couple, but I don't remember the

686
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,960
triad coming up.

687
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,480
I don't remember Japan coming up.

688
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,240
I don't remember any of this.

689
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
I want to know who the triad is.

690
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,240
I want to know what they're doing with Robert David Steele.

691
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
I don't think you can just toss that in there.

692
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,240
No, apparently you can't.

693
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,240
Just toss in Robert David Steele works for the triad.

694
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
Works for the triad, man.

695
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
In order to stay alive.

696
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
Right.

697
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,240
Yes.

698
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,240
So the Illuminati, we know that they're pretty involved in politics.

699
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,240
Usually.

700
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,240
And they're pushing back about this election.

701
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
Okay.

702
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:38,240
Right now, there's a great deal of evidence of Illuminati pushback.

703
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,240
So I want to stop this really quick, because one of the things that Carrie gets really

704
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,240
upset about, not really super upset, like not freaking out or anything, but she seems

705
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:53,240
to be bummed out that people are not taking seriously the people who talk about these

706
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,240
allegations of widespread fraud.

707
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,240
Sure.

708
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,240
But I would like to say that what she does in this clip is one of the reasons that no

709
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,240
one takes these people seriously.

710
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,240
Okay.

711
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:12,240
I got a call this morning from someone, one of my sources, who said that, I think it's

712
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,240
Arizona, that the governor has come forward and said, oh, there's not enough votes to

713
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,240
really cause a recount.

714
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,240
And so that governor has obviously been threatened.

715
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
Obviously.

716
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Has gone on the side of the Illuminati, even though I think I have it right.

717
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
Arizona is the right person.

718
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
Arizona is the right person.

719
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
I'm not sure.

720
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
Dr. Arizona.

721
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,240
What I'm saying is that some governor, and I heard it was a Republican governor, I thought

722
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,240
Arizona had a Democrat in the office, but I could be wrong.

723
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,240
Anyone in the chat can let me know which it is.

724
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,240
Do they have a governor?

725
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Because then I might have the state wrong.

726
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,240
But this is what came out this morning via source.

727
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,240
And it's out in the news.

728
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,240
Yeah.

729
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,240
Not a lot of details there.

730
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,240
Not a lot of sort of familiarity with the topic.

731
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,240
I don't really know if it's a Republican or a Democrat or what they're talking about or

732
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
why, but I do know there's fraud.

733
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Yeah.

734
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Like, I guess if you're mad that no one's taking that seriously, I would suggest that

735
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
you're not taking that seriously.

736
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,240
And that's why I'm not going to respond seriously to it.

737
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,240
Yeah.

738
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
That would make sense.

739
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
Come on.

740
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,240
I think it's Arizona.

741
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
Maybe somebody said something.

742
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
Yeah.

743
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
What the fuck?

744
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,240
Also, fuck off.

745
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,240
You can't care about recounts.

746
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,240
There are aliens that are real fighting everywhere.

747
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Yeah.

748
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
That is an issue for me, too.

749
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Why do you care about electoral politics?

750
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
At all.

751
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,240
If Biden wins or if Trump wins, there's still fucking space raptors.

752
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,240
Yeah, exactly.

753
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,240
Who are always among us and who have treaties and they're breaking them and remaking them

754
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
all day every day.

755
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
What does Biden matter?

756
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,240
Yeah.

757
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
Doesn't matter at all.

758
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
Doesn't matter.

759
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,240
Now, that is true.

760
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,240
That is strange.

761
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240
Yeah.

762
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:05,240
But these next two clips, I think, are really the balm that'll go on that burn you're feeling.

763
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
Okay.

764
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,240
And that is that like, okay, so this show is kind of nonsensical in the sense that it's

765
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,240
somehow concerned with a democratic politician.

766
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,240
Right.

767
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,240
There's a tremendous amount of information and evidence out there that Biden is not all

768
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
there.

769
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
Okay.

770
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,240
I guess everyone knows that that watches my shows.

771
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,240
But so that's just like all the other right wing media outlets.

772
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Right.

773
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
That's just the same.

774
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
Yeah.

775
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,600
But here is why Project Camelot is special.

776
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,700
There's a tremendous amount of information and evidence out there that Biden is not all

777
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,700
there.

778
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,700
Okay.

779
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:48,400
I guess everyone knows that that watches my shows, but in case you don't, there is reason

780
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,980
to believe that he is a clone.

781
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,980
There we go.

782
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,980
I think that's the stuff.

783
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,980
He is a clone.

784
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
He's also a walk-in.

785
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,980
He's a walk-in.

786
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,980
He's a what?

787
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,980
He's a walk-in.

788
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,980
He's a walk-in?

789
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,980
Yeah.

790
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,980
Grow up, man.

791
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,980
He's a walk-in clone?

792
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,980
You don't know about walk-ins?

793
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,980
No, I don't know about walk-ins.

794
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,980
Oh, look at this.

795
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,980
What, did he need a haircut and they just walked him into it?

796
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,980
They're like, ah, you're a clone now.

797
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,980
Look at this fucking kindergartener over here, not knowing about walk-ins.

798
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,640
I don't know what a walk-in is.

799
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,640
Come on, man.

800
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,840
Act like you've been there.

801
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,200
Is he a clone of Christopher Walk-in?

802
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,520
No, I did think that was a possibility.

803
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
That'd be great.

804
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,440
Uh, no, so yeah, I mean like, okay, yes, we have a situation where you're talking about

805
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,280
something very standard in right-wing media that Biden's not all there.

806
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,280
He's not all there, Dan.

807
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,640
Now your explanation for it is why I'm tickled, because he's a clone, and not only that, walk-in.

808
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,080
What is a walk-in?

809
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
Come on, man.

810
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,080
How are you?

811
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,400
You're really embarrassing yourself.

812
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,840
I'm willing to accept that.

813
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,840
He might be a walk-in.

814
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,440
I don't know what it is.

815
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,440
Well, I can tell you that one of the things that might lead you to believe that he's a

816
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,840
walk-in is if he uses language weirdly.

817
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
Sure.

818
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:59,080
There's one particular clip that's actually quite funny, but also very serious in a certain

819
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,280
sense where he's saying, I am going to be Joe Biden.

820
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,800
That's what he says.

821
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:12,760
And he says quite a few other things that indicate to me, uh, an alien who hasn't quite

822
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,640
learned the English language.

823
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,880
And so tends to put some words backwards or together that don't belong together.

824
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,840
Wait till I play a clip of you talking.

825
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:29,360
It could be an AI, but I, my, my instinct tends to say, this is kind of a man in black.

826
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,240
If you didn't know what men in black were supposed to be bodies, I know this is going

827
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:39,760
to sound, um, unbelievable to some bodies that have been dead and reanimated.

828
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:46,920
And then, uh, there's basically a walk-in and they get, uh, they behave as if they're

829
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
alive.

830
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
So that's what a walk-in is.

831
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,400
Apparently it's a dead body that an alien walks into.

832
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,040
I mean, I can't really argue with any of it.

833
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Do aliens walk into a dead body?

834
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
Right.

835
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Right.

836
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
Right.

837
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Classic set up for a joke.

838
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,040
Of course.

839
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Of course.

840
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,040
That is not what the movie Men in Black was about by the way.

841
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,040
First one says, why the long face?

842
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Second alien says, cause I ripped it in half.

843
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Yeah.

844
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,200
So that's a good explanation for why Biden says things that sound weird sometimes.

845
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Jack.

846
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
I just...

847
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
Come on, man.

848
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
I'm not an alien.

849
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Come on, man.

850
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
I'm not a walk-in.

851
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
I'm struggling.

852
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,640
I'm struggling with their evidence.

853
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,480
No, it makes total sense.

854
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,040
Has she ever hurt herself?

855
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,600
Like does she think that somebody could not possibly find a, whatever she plays with Biden.

856
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,960
Anytime she's misspoken, it's because someone was shooting 5G at her.

857
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
Oh, that's a good point.

858
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,960
Yeah.

859
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,840
So why doesn't Biden get the benefit of that doubt?

860
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,080
Maybe he's being shot at.

861
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,640
But see, you have introduced an interesting question and that is like, Trump misspeaks

862
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,640
a lot too.

863
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,640
Sure.

864
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,060
Now this is where it comes to, this is where the rubber meets the road and actually Kerry

865
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,060
explains it all.

866
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,060
I'm glad.

867
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:55,820
Now I know that people used to criticize Trump in this regard because Trump sort of uses

868
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:01,220
language in a certain way, but it's very unique to him and he's communicating.

869
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,800
So it's, you have to have discernment and be able to tell the difference actually.

870
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
I hate that word so much.

871
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,720
Well, you hate it because it's the truth.

872
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,800
I hate it because they don't know what it means and they continue saying it over and

873
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
over and over again.

874
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,800
So Biden misspeaks and it's proof that there's an alien up in him.

875
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Exactly.

876
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Walked in.

877
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Of course.

878
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,840
Trump misspeaks and it's proof that he's communicating and he's individualistic.

879
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Right.

880
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,800
And the only way to know the difference between the two is discernment, my friend.

881
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
All right.

882
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,640
Now let me posit you this theory real quick.

883
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,800
All right.

884
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,720
Alien wise, Biden makes mistakes in the way that we would consider normal.

885
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,440
For sort of an aging person.

886
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,680
In her estimation, based on the way that Trump is talking in a very unique and individualistic

887
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,760
way, then that suggests that Biden is making mistakes in a way that is very common.

888
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,000
Perhaps.

889
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,880
Perhaps.

890
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
If that's your comparison.

891
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,680
Well, I mean common for an alien who doesn't know English.

892
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:01,360
Well, what I would suggest though is that it is more likely the alien is somebody who

893
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:07,440
is doing something different from what we would consider to be relatively a non unique

894
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,440
behavior.

895
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,440
Can I ask you a question?

896
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Sure.

897
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,440
There's more than one alien, right?

898
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
Sure.

899
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
That can walk in.

900
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
Naturally.

901
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,020
Why would you choose one who doesn't know English?

902
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:21,960
Like why would you ever choose the alien for that assignment who's weird with English?

903
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,200
I mean, every alien's got to cut its teeth on some assignment.

904
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,440
You know, nobody starts out the most experienced alien walk in.

905
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,320
We need you to possess the fucking president of the United States.

906
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,760
Now it's going to be difficult for you to rise to that rank because you're going to

907
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
have to debate.

908
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,600
You're going to have to make a lot of public speeches.

909
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
A lot of that.

910
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,200
And you don't know English, which is an issue.

911
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,200
Yeah.

912
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,320
Let's get the fucking alien who doesn't know much English.

913
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,560
Let's get the raptor being who is a little bit iffy on verbs.

914
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,320
Now I like that as a, I think I like that as a like relative place of earthlings in

915
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,320
the universe.

916
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,280
They're like, this is the guys that they haven't even, this is the guys starting out.

917
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,320
This is the new guy who's got to try and take over the president.

918
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,440
He's learning for a more important mission, Dan.

919
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Not at all.

920
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,660
Not at all.

921
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,320
This indicates to me either these aliens are fucking incompetent.

922
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,320
That's fair.

923
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,960
Or they don't actually really want to, they're just fucking around.

924
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
They're sort of playful.

925
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
I imagine.

926
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
That's, that's fair.

927
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,840
Or, I mean, I do know that English is one of those languages that's like notoriously

928
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,600
difficult to learn later in life.

929
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Especially if you're an alien.

930
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
Yeah.

931
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
Yeah.

932
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Verb conjugation is very strange.

933
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Yeah, yeah.

934
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
So it could just be something like that.

935
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,840
A lot of idioms that you, you know, you might not even be, even if you speak English, you

936
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,480
might not be able to understand people.

937
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,680
So that makes sense.

938
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,120
I still say that if I'm an alien, I'm not signing off on the walk-in who doesn't know

939
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
English.

940
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,680
I would say that communicating is probably job number one for someone who's running for

941
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,040
public office.

942
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:54,560
I would say, sorry, you're a great walk-in, bad, bad speaker.

943
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,920
You know, you do a lot of good stuff.

944
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,240
We're going to keep you on here.

945
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,800
You're going to go to class for another year.

946
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,000
It's not that big a deal, man.

947
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I wonder when did he become a walk-in?

948
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Has he been?

949
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
No, no, no.

950
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Biden.

951
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,560
Has he been a walk-in this entire time or did he recently become a walk-in?

952
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,560
No idea.

953
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,560
No idea.

954
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
All right.

955
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
Let's see.

956
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:21,240
I think maybe that might be good for us because his previous policies, not good.

957
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Not good.

958
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,240
No.

959
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,680
He's an alien who's going to be a more progressive politician.

960
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,680
I like it.

961
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,360
Well, I'm rooting for alien on this one.

962
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,360
Well, all right.

963
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,560
But his soul is probably still in there.

964
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,560
Oh, shit.

965
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
That's a problem.

966
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
You've got to recognize that.

967
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,560
Okay.

968
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,120
There could still be Joe Biden, the soul, can still be in the body at the same time,

969
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:45,680
but they're pushed to the side and they are not really able to communicate for a variety

970
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:53,760
of reasons or they may actually be completely walled off and occupied elsewhere just trying

971
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,040
to hang on to the body, but not really being there.

972
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:04,720
And this can happen with a lot of illnesses with people, so it's not that unusual.

973
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,040
But what is unusual and what the Illuminati dark magicians must be laughing their asses

974
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:16,760
off about is the fact that the American people have actually voted for this guy.

975
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:23,260
So I know that this is a sort of a slap in the face behind the scenes at the Trump administration

976
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:31,520
who have plenty of magicians who are going to see through these ploys and know that that's

977
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
what they're doing.

978
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,520
It's a slap in the face.

979
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,520
Trump's magician.

980
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
Oh, God damn it.

981
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
My magicians lost.

982
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,360
His magician team is just so embarrassed that they lost to a walk-in.

983
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,240
Oh, no, no, no.

984
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,080
See, now I've got a whole new world that I would enjoy twice as much.

985
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:53,640
Imagine if Rudy Giuliani was exactly as incompetent and moronic, but could also fail at using

986
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
magic.

987
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,640
That'd be great.

988
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,640
Rudy Giuliani is a walk-in.

989
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,440
Yeah, he's a walk-in who can use evil magic.

990
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
I love it.

991
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
I love it.

992
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,880
Much like the idea of Robert David Steele being in the employee of the triad, a walk-in

993
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,940
is a new term that I've not heard on other episodes of this.

994
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,480
This is really expanding.

995
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,000
Can you reach that soul using the power of love, Dan?

996
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
No.

997
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,420
Oh, shit, they're really good.

998
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:24,620
So recently, just after the election, we heard Steve Pachanik come on The War Room with Owen

999
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:29,240
Troyer and talk about how the election was actually an elaborate setup.

1000
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:34,760
They used blockchain technology and barcodes in order to watermarks.

1001
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,400
And they immediately pretended that didn't happen.

1002
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,120
Yeah, they did not issue a retraction.

1003
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,920
Steve went way too QAnon.

1004
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,280
Turns out, carries into that.

1005
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
Of course.

1006
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,960
Obviously, a lot more votes went for Trump than went for Biden, in truth.

1007
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,700
But it's very difficult at this time, at least at the moment, to know exactly how many of

1008
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,360
those went for Trump.

1009
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:10,500
So I think perhaps the blockchain is revealing some of this.

1010
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:17,080
But I'm actually unsure, I'm curious how the blockchain was used.

1011
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,800
If it was used, it was used.

1012
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,080
And that's in, I guess, the sort of software.

1013
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,780
Yeah, I'm curious, too.

1014
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:29,440
But I also don't entertain any of these ideas because they're very stupid.

1015
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,720
It's really unfortunate to continue to hear.

1016
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,360
Well, obviously, this thing is true.

1017
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,960
I'm curious as to how or why they did it, but obviously, there's massive amounts of

1018
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,960
fraud.

1019
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,960
I don't know where or why or how.

1020
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,960
Yeah, it has been proven, but I don't understand it.

1021
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,280
I'm going to leave that aside because I just wanted to play that clip just to illustrate

1022
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,440
that like, oh, here's a connection with Steve Pachannik and all that bullshit nonsense.

1023
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,600
But I don't want to dwell on it because I'm too excited about this next clip.

1024
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,980
This next clip opens up all sorts of new vistas for us.

1025
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:06,200
I had a whistleblower that was revealing what is, in essence, the fight in the Pacific with

1026
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:21,000
our Navy and these Mer people back in, basically, associated with Mu underwater and the sailors.

1027
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,040
So I had a whistleblower in this regard.

1028
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:29,160
So I like that you were nodding aggressively through that, like, of course, of course.

1029
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,160
Totally.

1030
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,160
The sailors.

1031
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,160
The sailors.

1032
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,840
Who are associated with the kingdom of Mu.

1033
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,160
The sailors associated with the kingdom of Mu are fighting the Mer people.

1034
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,560
And then our Navy got mixed up in it at some point.

1035
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,560
Great.

1036
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,560
Love it.

1037
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,560
Oh, man.

1038
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,560
We're on this.

1039
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,560
We're going to need a few more details on this.

1040
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:54,120
Do our massive trillion dollar destroyers have issue with Mer people and tridents?

1041
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,280
They certainly did back then.

1042
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,280
Oh, well, that's fair.

1043
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,280
Yeah.

1044
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,800
Why did we invest so much money in it?

1045
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
Exactly.

1046
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,800
Why do you think the holes are so reinforced?

1047
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Tridents.

1048
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,800
Too many tridents.

1049
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,800
Yeah.

1050
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,080
We've learned from the wooden holes.

1051
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:11,320
I just feel like these are issues where we need to settle fundamental precepts.

1052
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,980
We just need to, like, I'm not going to believe you when you tell me that there was a battle

1053
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:25,120
with Mu and the Mer people at our Navy until you prove to me that Mer people are real.

1054
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,200
I can't go the second step because I'm not granting you the first one.

1055
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,760
No, no, no.

1056
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,760
Mer people are taken as red, Dan.

1057
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,760
No.

1058
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,720
How many species continue to go undiscovered every day?

1059
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,720
Raptors.

1060
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,720
Millions.

1061
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,720
Mercantile dogs.

1062
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,720
Millions.

1063
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,720
All the time.

1064
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,920
You go deep enough in the ocean, Mer people.

1065
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,320
Big beetles in Vietnam.

1066
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,200
It gets too dark down there to see.

1067
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,160
Of course Mer people are down there.

1068
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Sure.

1069
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,560
So, you know, Trump's a big problem for the Illuminati and all them.

1070
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,560
And not anymore.

1071
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,520
Well, you might have asked yourself, like, why didn't they just kill him?

1072
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,520
That is a good question.

1073
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,240
It turns out they've tried a bunch.

1074
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:06,280
But also, if they do kill him, it's mutually assured destruction, so they wouldn't do it.

1075
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,680
But they've also tried a whole bunch.

1076
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,680
Why would they try it?

1077
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:14,120
Okay, someone in the chat is saying he would have been killed, Trump would have been killed

1078
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,760
by February if he won again.

1079
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,400
Well, they've tried to kill him many times.

1080
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,400
How many?

1081
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:30,320
So it's important to realize that, again, it's kind of like a very interesting standoff.

1082
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,520
And it's a lot like, you know, The Godfather, right?

1083
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:39,080
So if you start killing people on one side, then the other side is going to start killing

1084
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,400
people on your side.

1085
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,620
And pretty soon there'll be nobody left.

1086
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:46,300
So it's called mutually assured destruction.

1087
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:51,600
And so this is not, and some people call it the nuclear option.

1088
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:56,200
This is not really an option for the game being played today.

1089
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,600
And it doesn't mean they won't try.

1090
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,200
It doesn't mean that it couldn't happen.

1091
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,520
I'm just saying that I know they've tried a number of times.

1092
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,440
I believe that Trump and team do have ET protection.

1093
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,440
Cool.

1094
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,840
But I do think that it should mean that they wouldn't try.

1095
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,080
I would assume that they wouldn't try, yes.

1096
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,760
If it's mutually assured destruction and it's not the way the game is being played or whatever,

1097
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,400
then it should not be a situation where they've tried and failed a bunch of times.

1098
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,120
Because they would know that if they succeeded, they would destroy themselves in the process.

1099
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:34,360
Sure, but I mean, you look at Cold War history and I could actually see people deciding like,

1100
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,360
eh, let's give it a shot.

1101
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,000
Well, here's my problem with that.

1102
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,920
The Soviet Union existed.

1103
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,020
That is a good point.

1104
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,720
That is a very good point.

1105
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,720
That is a good point.

1106
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
Yeah.

1107
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,720
It's tough to get around that.

1108
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,720
That's our problem.

1109
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,840
So, if he's got ET protection...

1110
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,840
Yes.

1111
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,240
Probably from Pleiadians, by the way.

1112
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,240
Sure.

1113
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,240
Probably.

1114
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,240
Because they're the good ones.

1115
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,240
Ostensibly.

1116
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,240
Well, hold on.

1117
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,240
Ostensibly.

1118
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,240
I don't know if you know this.

1119
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,240
There are actually...

1120
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,480
You know, almost every time we've ever heard Kerry talk about alien races, they're always

1121
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,720
uniform.

1122
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,760
They're always like, these ones are good, these ones are bad.

1123
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,920
I think it's because like they are all like resonating with something or there's some

1124
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,760
sort of like a, there's a magical element to it.

1125
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,120
It's like, you cannot be bad if you are a raptor or whatever.

1126
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,120
Yeah, yeah.

1127
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,880
There's some level of evolution maybe that is unspoken of or yeah.

1128
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,880
Perhaps.

1129
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,880
Yeah, yeah.

1130
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,880
It turns out that might not be the case.

1131
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,880
Okay.

1132
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,880
Because some Pleiadians are actually evil.

1133
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,880
Oh no.

1134
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:36,520
I believe that Trump and team do have ET protection of at least one race, and I'm pretty sure

1135
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:42,760
it's the Pleiadians, but it's a certain division of the Pleiadians because there are some dark

1136
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,340
groups in the Pleiadians.

1137
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:54,080
And that was proven by my interviews with Eddie, Eddie, okay, guy's name, now I'm drawing

1138
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,320
a blank on his last name.

1139
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,320
Page.

1140
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,320
Page.

1141
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,960
It would be Eddie Page.

1142
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,440
And I wouldn't say his name either.

1143
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:08,200
I love the idea that the words, that was proven by my interviews with Eddie Page.

1144
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,200
We can.

1145
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,780
That's a really good point.

1146
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:15,800
We can either decide from these interviews that Eddie Page is a raving crazy person and

1147
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:22,120
a racist who likes to think that he's an alien, or we can believe that some Pleiadians must

1148
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,240
be evil.

1149
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,280
Well, there is that.

1150
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,960
That's such an interesting decision-making tree.

1151
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,760
I can't not believe that he's a Pleiadian.

1152
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,600
So the fact that he's a Pleiadian must mean that there are evil Pleiadians.

1153
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,240
Ooh, that's a good point.

1154
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,560
Or you could just say, guy's talking shit.

1155
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,500
He was talking shit, but only because he was an evil Pleiadian.

1156
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,800
It doesn't have to be an either-or situation, Dan.

1157
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,360
I gotta say it's liberating to not believe any of this.

1158
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,360
Yeah, it is nice.

1159
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,360
It is nice.

1160
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:56,640
I feel less trapped in making up my own bullshit on a daily and constant basis.

1161
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,200
Yeah, it's very simple to explain what's going on here.

1162
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,440
Bunch of people talking shit.

1163
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,440
Don't need to go further than that.

1164
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,440
The end.

1165
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,440
But Carrie can speak freely and talk all the shit she wants.

1166
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,440
Why is that?

1167
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,440
Because she doesn't work for CNN.

1168
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,640
Oh, that's a good call.

1169
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:17,420
One of the reasons I can speak so freely here is that I'm considered super fringe.

1170
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:24,800
If I was mainstream, they probably would have fired me or killed me a long time ago.

1171
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,760
So it's when we're out on the fringe that we're allowed to get away with talking like

1172
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,760
this.

1173
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:39,560
Although I am under attack and sometimes it's very obvious, like having two strikes on my

1174
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,560
YouTube channel.

1175
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:45,200
I wouldn't call that an attack, but yeah, I think that she does make a good point.

1176
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:53,440
She can't speak freely because no one is her boss and no one can stop her from doing it.

1177
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,320
If you had an employer, you would have been fired long ago because the work is bad.

1178
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,680
It would be just bad.

1179
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,680
Because you don't do good.

1180
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,680
Yeah.

1181
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,080
And to be fair, we would have been fired long ago too.

1182
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:10,280
Not necessarily because terrible work, but because why would anyone pay us to do this?

1183
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,160
It's ridiculous.

1184
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:18,560
There is a freedom that comes with not being attached to some kind of a big entity or something.

1185
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:26,760
It doesn't mean that there's anything inherently like integrity bearing about it.

1186
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,320
It's just, you wouldn't have gotten killed if you worked for CNN, you would have been

1187
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,320
fired.

1188
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,320
Yeah.

1189
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,320
You're talking about fucking merpeople battles.

1190
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,520
Merpeople would be an interesting thing to hear on CNN.

1191
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:42,600
Wolf Blitzer comes in, our Navy took out three merpeople and broke a treaty.

1192
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,160
Oh, God damn it.

1193
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,240
The mer-treaty's broken.

1194
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:53,600
I like her version of the, because we always live in the, the enemy is both ultra powered

1195
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:59,480
and incredibly impossible to, it can't win and you know, super weak simultaneously.

1196
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:04,040
Hers feels more like a game though, because she's like, I'm allowed to do all this stuff

1197
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,760
because I'm on the fringe.

1198
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,940
They're still attacking me though.

1199
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:17,120
So it's like, why would you do an attack unless you kind of mean it to fail over and

1200
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,360
over and over again?

1201
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:23,320
You want to inconvenience the people like her who are truth tellers, but you don't want

1202
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,480
to make martyrs of them.

1203
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:32,560
I'm combining her and Alex's beliefs about this, the way they rationalize like, Hey,

1204
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:37,120
I've existed for a long time and no one seems to care.

1205
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,960
That kind of like, yeah, if you went too hard against me, it would prove me right.

1206
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,960
Or that kind of.

1207
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,960
Right.

1208
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,400
If you were to go against me at all, I would be too powerful.

1209
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,200
I would succeed in the fringes.

1210
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,200
All right.

1211
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,680
So it's sabotage.

1212
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,680
That's what they're more interested in.

1213
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,100
I can see you have figured it out, Dan.

1214
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:01,080
So she, you know, she carries on the same page as Steve in terms of the like watermarks

1215
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,280
on balance, the blockchain, the whole thing.

1216
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:09,400
And she seems to be on another sort of similar tip and that is really thinking Melania is

1217
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,400
really important.

1218
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,160
Thoughts about Melania and their son?

1219
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,800
Well, I think Melania is OK.

1220
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:24,400
Let me just say that Captain Mark Richards has said he believes Melania is in touch with

1221
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:32,960
an E.T. race and that she is a conduit conduit for Trump to get the downloads and information

1222
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,400
from that race.

1223
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,280
And I think that's very possible.

1224
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,280
Yeah.

1225
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:44,200
And I guess it's Mark Richards also thinks that she's not fully human.

1226
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,400
And that's that's also very possible.

1227
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:53,400
I think that this is an interesting way that people like Kerry are trying to rationalize

1228
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,320
the sense that Melania doesn't seem to be doing anything.

1229
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,480
Or interested at all in this whatsoever.

1230
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,480
Yeah.

1231
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,480
Yeah.

1232
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,440
And I think that like, you know, trying to have this like, all right, Trump is a superhuman

1233
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:10,400
battling against the forces of darkness and all the demonic child abusers who live under

1234
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,360
the Getty Museum or whatever the fuck.

1235
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,360
Indeed.

1236
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,640
You know, like you have this heroic figure and then his wife is somebody who just seems

1237
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,480
to not give a shit about anything.

1238
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,480
Yeah.

1239
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,560
And in order to make that make sense, you have to create this elaborate backstory, which

1240
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,920
I guess she doesn't talk that much in public and doesn't get involved in too much because

1241
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,280
she's too busy being a conduit for the aliens to help Trump with his secret protection.

1242
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,280
Sure.

1243
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,280
Sure.

1244
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,560
And the aliens get like upgrade.

1245
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,820
Okay.

1246
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:39,000
The aliens upgrade Trump with a new wife.

1247
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,280
And that's why he's had so many.

1248
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,280
Yeah.

1249
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,080
I mean, I guess that's one way you could get around.

1250
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,080
One way you do it.

1251
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,080
Yeah.

1252
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,080
So Trump, you know, with the help of his conduit wife.

1253
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,080
Sure.

1254
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,080
He's true.

1255
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,080
What he's doing is I can't stress this enough.

1256
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,520
There's big Adronachrome out there.

1257
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,520
Okay.

1258
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,600
You know how there's big pharma, big oil.

1259
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:08,080
There's also a big Adronachrome manufacturing industry publicly traded on the black market.

1260
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,080
Oh, okay.

1261
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,080
Secret market.

1262
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,080
Okay, good.

1263
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,080
Yes.

1264
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,080
Shadow market.

1265
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,080
Shadow market.

1266
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,080
And Trump is trying to dismantle that.

1267
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,120
And this is so crucial.

1268
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:22,200
And that's the same thing with Adronachrome and that whole manufacturing production line

1269
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:29,840
that involves, you know, taking a baby, you know, from their parents or whatever, or even

1270
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:37,080
in vitro creating test tube babies as product, and then getting a Adronachrome out at the

1271
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,480
other end.

1272
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,000
This is a very diabolical process.

1273
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,040
There's nothing they have control over in those regards.

1274
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:52,920
Now they may be attempting to get control and that has to involve a battle and you can't

1275
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,980
ask nicely.

1276
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,160
So that means a war.

1277
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:02,800
That means the one with the biggest gun wins, you know, the best technology, however you

1278
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,900
want to ride it, and so on.

1279
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:08,840
So this is what we're dealing with and what he's dealing with.

1280
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,160
That's what Trump's dealing with.

1281
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,680
He's dealing with a manufacturing industry of trying to make test tube babies to scare

1282
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,560
and then drink their blood.

1283
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:22,080
I got to be honest, all too often, I don't really think about what he has to deal with.

1284
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,080
Right.

1285
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,080
You got to empathize a little bit more.

1286
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,080
You really do.

1287
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,080
Because if he's got to deal with this.

1288
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,760
I have a quick question though.

1289
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,760
Sure.

1290
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,760
Alright.

1291
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,640
Um, so we can clone people, right?

1292
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,640
Yeah.

1293
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,640
Okay.

1294
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,720
So that means we can basically manufacture bodies, right?

1295
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,720
Mm hmm.

1296
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,680
Wouldn't that suggest we could also manufacture just the blood?

1297
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,680
Yep.

1298
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,200
And we can also synthesize Adronachrome.

1299
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,200
Yeah.

1300
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,400
So I don't understand.

1301
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:54,240
So I guess it has to be some like dark ritual thing that they're talking about to gain the

1302
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,460
intergalactic strength, I guess.

1303
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,720
But in this cosmology, it seems like you could just really easily manufacture.

1304
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:04,020
It's like in the underworld movies, if we're going to only ever talk about movies whenever

1305
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,960
we're talking about Carrie Cassidy, you can make your own fucking blood and you move on.

1306
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,360
Everybody gets a good job.

1307
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,360
Yeah.

1308
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,360
Yeah.

1309
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,180
I think that, I think that, you know, it's interesting that they don't ever go down that

1310
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,600
road of thought.

1311
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:23,000
And it's to their detriment because it's a big gaping hole in their theory.

1312
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,440
But what I think is interesting about the way that Carrie is expressing this and presenting

1313
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,600
it is like, this is not going to end without a war, right?

1314
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:40,420
So if a war doesn't happen internally, then that is evidence that this Adronachrome manufacturing

1315
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,020
industry is still up and running.

1316
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:49,540
There must be a giant conflagration or else there is no change in the status quo.

1317
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,540
That's fucked up.

1318
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:54,680
Why have we got Congress to regulate the industry?

1319
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,680
What?

1320
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:03,260
Why isn't Carrie, look, if she's interested in electoral politics now, why isn't she campaigning

1321
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:08,960
for enough senators and congresspersons to write a law regulating the use of Adronachrome?

1322
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,120
You broke my brain.

1323
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:16,160
I don't know why she's not trying to go the civic route.

1324
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,240
I'm just saying if we got a participatory republic, I think she should start there instead

1325
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,240
of the secret war.

1326
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,240
Fair enough.

1327
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,240
Fair enough.

1328
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,440
That might be a good first step.

1329
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,520
So at this point, Carrie's kind of running out of energy and like kind of, you know,

1330
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,600
petering out a little, but she takes a couple of questions from the chat.

1331
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,960
I don't think that she actually reads the questions themselves, but responds to them.

1332
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,640
This first one is about the queen.

1333
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,640
Okay.

1334
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:49,200
So we'll find out if there's anything else people might want to ask.

1335
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,720
Okay.

1336
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:59,080
So somebody thinks that the queen was beheaded and we don't have the regular, I'm sure they

1337
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,960
think she's a clone or whatever.

1338
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,960
Yeah.

1339
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,960
How stupid is that?

1340
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,160
A lot of this is conjecture in my opinion.

1341
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:10,000
I mean, these people put out this stuff, but that doesn't mean they know.

1342
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,720
Everyone knows the queen's a walk-in.

1343
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,720
Oh man.

1344
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,640
A lot of these dumb-dumbs think that the queen is a clone.

1345
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,640
That's not true.

1346
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,640
Joe Biden's a clone.

1347
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,520
Duh, idiots.

1348
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:26,320
So strange to try and figure out like what's the difference between conjecture A and conjecture

1349
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,120
B. Completely different.

1350
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,260
It was proven in the interviews with Eddie Page, Dan.

1351
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,260
Some Pleiadians are evil.

1352
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,260
Some Pleiadians are evil.

1353
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,260
Yeah.

1354
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,260
That's all you need to know.

1355
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:40,400
In this clip, she fields a call about whether or not Trump is Anunnaki.

1356
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,880
Ooh, that's a good question.

1357
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,880
He's not.

1358
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,880
Okay.

1359
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,880
Is Trump Anunnaki?

1360
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,560
No, I think Trump-

1361
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,680
He's an Anunnaki.

1362
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,720
Is not Anunnaki.

1363
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,880
Trump is a reincarnation of General Patton.

1364
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,880
He is a villain of a civil mission and he is a person.

1365
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,880
Pleiadian.

1366
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,880
Yep.

1367
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,880
Uh-huh.

1368
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,880
Yep.

1369
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,760
Yeah, a hero of General Patton.

1370
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:12,160
General Patton, The General Patton that we are speaking of.

1371
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,160
Yes.

1372
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,160
Okay.

1373
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,160
Yep.

1374
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,160
When did he die?

1375
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,160
Actually, I did look this up.

1376
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,160
Uh-huh.

1377
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,160
He died just before Trump was born.

1378
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,160
Really?

1379
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,160
Ooh, maybe he is?

1380
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,160
I think that's-

1381
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,160
I assume that's why they say it.

1382
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,160
Yeah.

1383
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,160
Yeah, yeah.

1384
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,160
They looked it up, otherwise they would feel real stupid.

1385
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,160
Yes.

1386
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1387
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,160
Yeah.

1388
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,680
Yeah, it is- it's pretty close to like I think it's maybe like six, eight months off or something

1389
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,680
like that.

1390
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,680
Six, eight months off?

1391
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,680
What is he- what's Trump doing?

1392
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,080
six to eight months spiritually.

1393
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,040
Got a lounge.

1394
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:37,880
Got a lounge?

1395
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,720
Take a load off.

1396
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,540
Oh, that's fair.

1397
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:40,380
Patton's life is tough.

1398
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,220
Patton, it's exhausting.

1399
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,040
Yeah, you know, you're right.

1400
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,740
And then you gotta prepare for being a horrifying monster.

1401
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,580
Yeah.

1402
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,880
I gotcha.

1403
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,880
At this point, Carrie discusses Israel and her feelings.

1404
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,460
Oh, stop.

1405
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,300
And...

1406
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,120
She should not.

1407
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,660
I'm gonna say I don't respect her enough

1408
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:02,660
to even joke about how terrible and stupid her ideas

1409
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:05,240
about Israel are, so we're just gonna skip past that.

1410
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,080
Okay, good.

1411
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:06,900
Good call.

1412
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,640
And get into more interesting territory,

1413
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:13,640
and that is Alex Jones believes that there is a virus.

1414
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,100
COVID.

1415
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:15,940
Yes.

1416
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:18,520
COVID-19 is real, but it's also a hoax.

1417
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,760
Even though he has David Icke on,

1418
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,160
who says that it's not real at all.

1419
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,000
Right.

1420
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,680
That's another version of this.

1421
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,200
David Icke believes there is no virus.

1422
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,040
Correct.

1423
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,900
But also seems to believe in medical science

1424
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,600
to an extent. Somewhat, I guess.

1425
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,800
Carrie doesn't believe viruses exist.

1426
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,640
Okay.

1427
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,520
My understanding of viruses,

1428
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,600
and I credit Dr. Robert Young for teaching me about this,

1429
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:46,580
is that actually they've never isolated a real virus.

1430
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:51,000
That viruses are not what you think they are,

1431
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,440
and that they're simply poisons expelled by our cells

1432
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,280
when we're faced with poisons in the outer

1433
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,000
and inner environment through food we eat

1434
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,280
or somebody shooting us up with, say, a bioweapon.

1435
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,440
Sure.

1436
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,120
I think she might be right.

1437
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,760
A lot of the times I worry that my humors and Icke's

1438
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,360
are out of balance with each other, and that can happen,

1439
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:17,440
and then you'll just start influencing.

1440
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,560
A lot of people thought stuff like that,

1441
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,840
about like humors and what have you,

1442
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,000
and then at a certain point,

1443
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,600
people thought about like germs.

1444
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,640
Sure, yeah.

1445
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,080
But they were wrong.

1446
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,240
The viruses are part of what's called germ theory,

1447
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,080
and germ theory is very old-fashioned,

1448
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,120
going back to the past year,

1449
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:43,120
and then that information was actually, as usual, wrong.

1450
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:48,280
And I've done several interviews with Dr. Robert Young

1451
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,080
about all of this, so you can go on my website,

1452
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,040
search under his last name, and find those interviews,

1453
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,800
and I highly recommend them.

1454
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,160
If you want to find out about the history

1455
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,000
and why germ theory is no longer believed

1456
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,960
by the most intelligent, advanced doctors out there.

1457
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,320
So that's important to know.

1458
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,480
You gotta do a little better than Robert Young

1459
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,240
as your reference for-

1460
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,080
Number one.

1461
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,200
No, we talked about him

1462
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,080
on another Project Camelot episode.

1463
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,280
He is the guy who like went to jail.

1464
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:25,960
He talked someone into not getting treatment for cancer,

1465
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,320
and getting his holistic approach,

1466
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:33,960
and then they got stage four incurable progression,

1467
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,000
and he got sued for millions of dollars because of that,

1468
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,720
like malpractice, and didn't have a license for a period.

1469
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,960
Anyway, if he is the most advanced, hippest, coolest doctor

1470
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,400
who's telling you all about how germ theory is wrong,

1471
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,500
I would say branch out, talk to a few more doctors,

1472
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,040
because this is silly.

1473
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,440
I like her calling germs there.

1474
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,240
Oh, it's very old-fashioned, the germ theory.

1475
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,560
Compared to obviously things create are inside yourselves,

1476
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,560
and then they explode out whenever it's poisoned.

1477
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,160
That's brand new research, Dan.

1478
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,720
Nobody has ever thought- That's hip.

1479
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,740
That maybe spontaneous generation of poisons

1480
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:12,160
could explode through your body.

1481
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,000
Yeah.

1482
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,880
Ah, that's a new one.

1483
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,840
So look, dude, the germs and germ theory,

1484
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:20,120
it's all a plot by the aliens.

1485
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,840
Maybe, who knows? Sure, eh, why not?

1486
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,960
And you know, so you think that germs and viruses,

1487
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,160
that you think everything's contagious, but it's not.

1488
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,000
Oh.

1489
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,840
But you know what are?

1490
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,660
Bad viewings?

1491
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:31,880
Memes. Oh.

1492
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,640
What is contagious, however,

1493
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,720
and can be taken in through osmosis, what's called osmosis,

1494
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,760
and in essence, through memes,

1495
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,120
is the mental infection that you get

1496
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,480
because you are, you become,

1497
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,760
you might mind control, basically.

1498
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,600
Of course.

1499
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,960
You are persuaded, influenced mentally

1500
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:57,680
to take something on.

1501
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,520
So that means that when you are in a household

1502
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,360
and someone catches a cold,

1503
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:06,720
you can easily catch it through what's called empathy.

1504
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:07,560
Okay?

1505
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:12,360
And so this is, it's all in the way you think about things.

1506
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,840
And that is, that's first and foremost,

1507
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,680
how we affect our bodies, is how you think.

1508
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,500
Now, interestingly, this would be really easy,

1509
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,580
or I mean, there would be a way to scientifically

1510
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,120
try and get to the bottom of this.

1511
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,520
You would have to construct something

1512
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,120
where knowing that someone you care about deeply is sick

1513
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,320
causes you to get sick.

1514
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,160
Exactly.

1515
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,800
And I don't think that studies have borne that out.

1516
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,340
Nah, I'm pretty sure it's true.

1517
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,400
Because if you're saying, oh yeah, yeah, yeah,

1518
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,920
when you're in a house with someone

1519
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,320
who has a contagious illness,

1520
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:45,480
you get it because it's empathy.

1521
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,320
Right.

1522
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,500
That would be indistinguishable

1523
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:50,040
from getting it because of germs or contagious illness.

1524
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,800
So her theory would be tested very easily

1525
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,520
if say you were long distance away from somebody.

1526
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:56,360
Exactly.

1527
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,200
That's what I'm saying.

1528
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,020
Who cared very deeply about it.

1529
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,480
And I don't know of any transmission of diseases

1530
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,740
long distance.

1531
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:04,080
There's no morphic transmission of diseases?

1532
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,880
If Kerry can establish this

1533
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,940
and point me to some literature on it, I'd be interested.

1534
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:13,200
But I've got a doctor with your name on him.

1535
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,040
Robert Young?

1536
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:14,880
Oh yeah.

1537
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,440
I don't, I'm not gonna listen to him.

1538
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,280
Oh boy.

1539
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,000
Anyway, Kerry's got one last thing to say here.

1540
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,360
She's talking to a lot of people all around the world

1541
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,240
and they're all interested in this election.

1542
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,080
Of course.

1543
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,280
And I'm talking to people all over the world,

1544
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,160
you know, and in contact with them

1545
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,640
since I travel so much in the past,

1546
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,400
haven't been able to do much traveling lately.

1547
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,040
And I can say that they are also very long.

1548
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:38,880
Too much empathy?

1549
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,160
Because they realize that in a certain sense,

1550
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,940
this is all about who is gonna run planet earth,

1551
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:47,760
at least on the human side.

1552
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,600
Of course.

1553
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,360
And so that's what this election really comes down to.

1554
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,360
So, okay.

1555
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:59,360
I think I am sort of done for now.

1556
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,480
Yeah, me too.

1557
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,320
I don't know.

1558
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,400
I think that it's such a gross perspective

1559
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,140
to be like, whoever wins this election

1560
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,840
is who's gonna run the planet.

1561
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:07,660
Yeah.

1562
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:08,960
Just because, I mean, first of all,

1563
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,880
it's so America centric.

1564
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,720
Oh yeah.

1565
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,820
It's so disrespectful to the other countries of the world.

1566
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:14,660
Yep.

1567
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,480
But second, like, I don't think,

1568
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,240
like, of course I want everything to turn out

1569
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,480
that Biden becomes president.

1570
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,080
I don't want him running the world.

1571
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:24,920
No.

1572
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,880
But it's very strange that these people,

1573
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,480
people like Kerry, people like Alex,

1574
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,880
they do want Trump running the world.

1575
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,300
Yes, 100%.

1576
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,760
And the fear, like, it's just so weird.

1577
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:39,320
Like, why would you want that even if you like this guy?

1578
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,160
I don't know.

1579
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,120
I liked Obama as president.

1580
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,380
You know, obviously had some problems

1581
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,000
in a lot of policies and decisions.

1582
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:46,840
Sure.

1583
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,800
But even as much as I supported him

1584
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,160
as the president of the United States,

1585
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,800
I never would want him to be the head of the world.

1586
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,640
No, absolutely not.

1587
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:54,640
Head of humans.

1588
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,720
No, no.

1589
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,240
It's very silly.

1590
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,300
It's childish.

1591
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,880
Yeah, I don't get how they can jive

1592
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:05,520
those two things together without just openly saying,

1593
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:10,520
like, I want the end of all participatory government.

1594
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,520
Period.

1595
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,760
Well, I mean, if you have-

1596
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,640
Like, that's your-

1597
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,040
You can't vote for aliens.

1598
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,560
So, like, if you believe that that's the real world

1599
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,640
that's going on behind the scenes,

1600
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,560
what does it really matter if you give up

1601
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,360
the pretense of democracy?

1602
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,200
Yeah, exactly.

1603
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,480
You know, like, sure.

1604
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,680
Yeah, you can feel good about casting a vote,

1605
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,640
but that person's working for a lizard.

1606
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,480
Right.

1607
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,300
You understand?

1608
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,140
So it doesn't matter.

1609
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:35,400
And I think the thing that really,

1610
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,480
like, the thing that's interesting to me

1611
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,280
about how they always go about this is that

1612
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,120
at no point in time is it like,

1613
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,460
let's get enough people together,

1614
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,080
because they know that they can't actually

1615
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,280
get people to do anything.

1616
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,120
I mean, we saw the caravan.

1617
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,020
We saw the caravan.

1618
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:52,440
They're not gonna be like, let's get a movement together.

1619
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,000
They're just like, it all has to be in secret,

1620
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,440
because if I tried to get a bunch of people to know it,

1621
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,720
they'd realize that I'm an idiot, you know?

1622
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,800
There's that option, or the other option is,

1623
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,600
let's wait until someone else builds something

1624
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,440
and then co-opt it like a tea party.

1625
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,320
Yeah, exactly, yeah.

1626
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,160
Yep.

1627
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,840
But look, I just think, like, you know,

1628
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,640
I start to feel like Trump's been really bad

1629
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,480
for these people.

1630
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,320
Oh yeah.

1631
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,320
It's like, this is sad.

1632
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,600
Like, if you're somebody who's like,

1633
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:24,000
I'm all about the ins and outs of secret programs,

1634
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,420
and I'm all about the, like,

1635
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,680
these aliens that have been visiting us forever,

1636
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,880
and my friend who's definitely not a murderer

1637
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,360
talks to raptors in prison,

1638
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:35,160
and he tells me all about these great space adventures

1639
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,960
and sentient spaceships,

1640
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,320
you should not give a shit about a president.

1641
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,160
Nope.

1642
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,960
It's degrading for you two.

1643
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,320
Okay, so.

1644
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,240
Because Trump isn't fucking revealing

1645
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,680
anything about the space.

1646
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,520
Nope.

1647
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,200
He's not gonna prove you right.

1648
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,040
Nope.

1649
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,400
You know that.

1650
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,260
I think one of the hugest things

1651
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:55,320
that's been an issue for them,

1652
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,500
with Trump being president,

1653
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,520
and this is,

1654
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,600
cause we've heard this joke so many times,

1655
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,040
or at least I have this,

1656
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,200
the joke so many times, like,

1657
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,480
when Obama was president,

1658
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,640
I didn't have to care about politics,

1659
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:08,560
that's why I liked him,

1660
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,960
cause I could walk, do my day,

1661
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,880
and think that there's a reasonable person

1662
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,600
who's trying, you know?

1663
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,640
That kind of thing.

1664
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:19,320
With Trump, everyone has been paying attention

1665
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,320
all the time.

1666
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,000
So all of that secret stuff,

1667
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,900
all this stuff that's going on behind the scenes,

1668
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,360
has to be so secret now,

1669
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,800
that it's just either you believe it

1670
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,840
to the point where you've completely lost

1671
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,320
any sense of reality,

1672
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,760
or you just have to go like,

1673
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,440
no, this is too stupid,

1674
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,520
this is just too dumb.

1675
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,240
And that's where QAnon gets a foothold.

1676
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,880
Exactly, yeah.

1677
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,160
I just think that,

1678
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,920
you know, when the history books are written,

1679
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,920
no one will write about Project Camelot,

1680
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,440
but if they do,

1681
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,080
it's just,

1682
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,320
it's just, you should,

1683
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,480
everyone who made a decision

1684
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,280
to sign up with this is like,

1685
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,360
they made a bad move.

1686
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:02,360
Strategically, they made a bad move for their grifts.

1687
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,120
It seemed like it was gonna be really good

1688
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:04,960
in the short term,

1689
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,860
but it's just not gonna pay off.

1690
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:08,080
There's going to be too much

1691
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,840
that you're gonna have to answer for later

1692
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:10,720
and explain away,

1693
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,720
like, how are you gonna explain Melania

1694
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,440
being a space conduit in five years?

1695
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,320
Like, why isn't she still a space conduit?

1696
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,800
Ah, they let her go.

1697
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,800
Okay, sure, whatever.

1698
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,200
They replaced her with a new space,

1699
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,020
I don't know.

1700
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:26,580
Okay, and then in a year,

1701
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:28,800
like Biden, is he still a walk-in?

1702
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:29,800
Yeah, that's a good question.

1703
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,200
Like, what's going on?

1704
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,660
Well, I think that's probably why it's so,

1705
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:35,460
they're all so very desperate

1706
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:37,720
for Trump to remain in office forever.

1707
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,920
Because as long as he's in office forever,

1708
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,480
you can make up all kinds of bullshit.

1709
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,560
But after a while,

1710
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:46,080
everybody starts looking at reality again,

1711
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,040
like, oh man, shit, that's crazy.

1712
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,640
Why did people believe that he was going to,

1713
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:54,140
how many, Hunter Biden is just gone now.

1714
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:55,920
We just don't even talk about that shit.

1715
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,380
I'm sure some people still are.

1716
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:58,220
Maybe.

1717
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:59,680
I bet Kerry put out a video about him last week.

1718
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:00,560
That's probably true.

1719
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,440
That's probably true.

1720
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,800
Which again, I don't know

1721
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,160
what the alien angle on that is.

1722
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,600
That's a good question.

1723
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,440
But yeah, it's interesting.

1724
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,480
I feel like there was a part of me

1725
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,280
that while I was listening to this episode,

1726
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,160
I was like, what does this have to do with space?

1727
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,280
And then it did come in,

1728
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:20,720
and I was like, oh, that's what it has to do with space.

1729
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,120
And some of it's pretty funny,

1730
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,920
like the idea of merpeople battles.

1731
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,920
Love merpeople battles.

1732
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,960
I was learning about walk-ins

1733
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,120
and how Robert David Steele's working for the triads.

1734
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,320
But yeah, it's kind of,

1735
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,400
I feel like she's in a rut too.

1736
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,660
Yeah.

1737
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:35,900
How?

1738
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:36,740
It's tough.

1739
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:40,400
I can't believe that they're this committed

1740
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,620
to not admitting that they got conned.

1741
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,800
Well, it's tough because, you know,

1742
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,240
I mean, like the two people that we talk about,

1743
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:52,200
maybe the most, Kerry and Alex, are both psychics.

1744
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,520
Yeah.

1745
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,360
Yeah, that's true.

1746
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,280
So they can't get conned.

1747
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,860
They have built themselves up so much

1748
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:02,800
that to admit even the slightest bit of I got hoodwinked

1749
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,360
is a real hit to their brand.

1750
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,400
Yeah, they're both psychics,

1751
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,720
which would be invalidated

1752
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,920
if they were on the wrong path for four years

1753
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:09,760
in the same way, you know.

1754
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,440
But AJ apologized to Hamdi Ulukaya

1755
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:13,720
and everybody just moved on.

1756
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,000
But he tried to pretend that he didn't.

1757
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,840
Yeah, that's true.

1758
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:16,680
Yeah.

1759
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:17,500
Oh boy.

1760
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,340
I don't know.

1761
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,280
Anyway, this has been a nice little trip down a wackier road.

1762
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,480
This has been a lovely wacky Monday.

1763
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,680
Yeah.

1764
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,640
Hopefully Alex will be back in studio

1765
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:25,540
beginning of this week,

1766
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:29,080
and we can check back in on the hashtag 79 days of hell.

1767
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,440
See how that's going.

1768
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:31,880
I'm sure it's going great.

1769
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:32,960
But until then, we have a website.

1770
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,800
We do have a website.

1771
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:34,640
It's knowledgefight.com.

1772
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:35,640
Yeah, we're also on Twitter.

1773
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:36,480
We are on Twitter.

1774
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,360
It's at knowledge underscore fight

1775
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,760
and at go to bed Jordan.

1776
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:39,680
Yeah, we're also on Facebook.

1777
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,240
We are on Facebook, it's outside.

1778
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,800
If you could please find a local charity

1779
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,760
or bail fund in your area

1780
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,940
to help out people doing God's work right now.

1781
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:47,780
We'll be back.

1782
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:50,720
But until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX Clark.

1783
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,880
I'm Daryl Rundis.

1784
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,320
I am the truant time traveler.

1785
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,280
Andy in Kansas.

1786
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,120
You're on the air.

1787
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:56,940
Thanks for holding.

1788
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,240
Hello, Alex.

1789
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,080
I'm a first time caller.

1790
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:00,900
I'm a huge fan.

1791
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:01,740
I love your work.

1792
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:02,580
Love you.
