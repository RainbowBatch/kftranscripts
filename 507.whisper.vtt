N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:18.080
Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am SWEATING

00:18.080 --> 00:21.280
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

00:21.280 --> 00:23.880
I have great respect for Knowledgefight

00:23.880 --> 00:25.160
Knowledgefight

00:25.160 --> 00:27.400
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

00:27.400 --> 00:30.040
Shang, we are the bad guys, Knowledgefight

00:30.040 --> 00:32.200
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight

00:32.200 --> 00:35.000
Rattle her, rattle her, rattle her

00:35.000 --> 00:39.360
Need, I need money, rattle her, rattle her

00:39.360 --> 00:42.200
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and

00:42.200 --> 00:44.720
Stop it, Andy and Kan, Andy and Kansas

00:44.720 --> 00:47.120
Andy and, Andy and, it's time to pray

00:47.120 --> 00:49.440
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us

00:49.440 --> 00:51.760
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan

00:51.760 --> 00:53.000
I love your work

00:53.000 --> 00:54.840
Knowledgefight

00:54.840 --> 00:58.480
N-N-N-N-N-Knowledgefight.com

00:58.480 --> 00:59.280
I love you

00:59.280 --> 01:01.400
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan

01:01.400 --> 01:01.960
I'm Jordan

01:01.960 --> 01:04.080
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages

01:04.080 --> 01:05.800
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:05.800 --> 01:07.080
Oh indeed we are Dan

01:07.080 --> 01:07.440
Jordan

01:07.440 --> 01:07.920
Dan!

01:07.920 --> 01:08.560
Jordan

01:08.560 --> 01:09.440
I have a quick question for you

01:09.440 --> 01:09.840
What's up?

01:09.840 --> 01:10.600
What's your bright spot today?

01:10.600 --> 01:17.040
My bright spot today, Jordan, is just a nice sort of glow

01:17.040 --> 01:22.160
the post-holiday glow of having, we got to spend a little time

01:22.160 --> 01:23.080
Oh yeah, indeed

01:23.080 --> 01:26.160
the live stream put on by Cognitive Dissonance

01:26.160 --> 01:27.760
It was great, raised a lot of money

01:27.760 --> 01:29.320
That was awesome, congratulations

01:29.320 --> 01:32.840
Yeah, it was really a great time, a lot of fun to chat with them

01:32.840 --> 01:42.160
and to be overwhelmed, quite frankly, by the support of people donating to the Senate campaign

01:42.160 --> 01:43.400
Quite crazy, honestly

01:43.400 --> 01:49.160
And I started to reflect on it, I'm like, we did a terrible job of promoting this

01:49.160 --> 01:54.160
I think there's some tweets and stuff, but we forgot to mention it on our last episode

01:54.160 --> 01:55.960
because we recorded it in advance

01:55.960 --> 01:58.120
It's too early, it's too early, it was a day early

01:58.120 --> 02:00.520
We can't promote something more than a day in advance

02:00.520 --> 02:02.640
Two days in the future doesn't exist in my bright spot

02:02.640 --> 02:04.040
It doesn't exist for us

02:04.040 --> 02:08.960
But yeah, it was nice to be invited, it was nice to be along for the ride on that

02:08.960 --> 02:09.640
It was fantastic

02:09.640 --> 02:10.960
How about you, what's your bright spot?

02:10.960 --> 02:16.200
My bright spot, Dan, aside from us having a lovely holiday together

02:16.200 --> 02:19.000
playing some board games and the like

02:19.000 --> 02:21.080
You introduced me to ham

02:21.080 --> 02:24.120
I did introduce you to ham, I cooked you a ten pound ham, Dan

02:24.120 --> 02:25.080
Well, I didn't eat all of it

02:25.080 --> 02:27.880
We ate less than two pounds of that ham

02:27.880 --> 02:33.880
I come from a non-ham family, and so I have not experienced really like a ham steak

02:33.880 --> 02:35.080
or like a slice of ham

02:35.080 --> 02:38.840
Marinated in a little maple syrup, did all kinds of fun stuff

02:38.840 --> 02:40.440
I couldn't really taste the maple syrup

02:40.440 --> 02:42.040
Nope, I'm not good at cooking ham

02:42.040 --> 02:46.920
But it was very nice, very, very delightful

02:46.920 --> 02:51.480
It was a great, great holiday, but in order to tell you what my actual bright spot is, Dan

02:51.480 --> 02:54.600
I'm gonna have to open up my correspondence cage

02:54.600 --> 02:57.400
Just to be clear, we didn't have a big gathering or anything

02:57.400 --> 02:57.960
We didn't, no

02:57.960 --> 03:00.520
In case people are thinking that we had like a Thanksgiving party

03:00.520 --> 03:01.320
It was the two of us

03:01.320 --> 03:01.820
Yeah

03:02.680 --> 03:03.480
As always

03:03.480 --> 03:04.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah

03:04.920 --> 03:07.720
Just in case people are thinking, ah, you're flouting COVID

03:07.720 --> 03:09.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're all, oh yes, me and-

03:09.720 --> 03:11.560
Very careful, very careful

03:11.560 --> 03:13.080
It was very, very small

03:13.080 --> 03:13.880
I'm sorry, but go ahead

03:13.880 --> 03:14.520
No problem

03:14.520 --> 03:18.920
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and open up my correspondence cage over here, Dan

03:18.920 --> 03:19.420
Click

03:20.440 --> 03:27.000
And a new raptor princess, Kranat, created a cover for my book

03:27.000 --> 03:27.480
Oh, that's great

03:27.480 --> 03:33.320
Made a graphic design that is not just a great cover and a great design, but like really perfect

03:33.320 --> 03:33.880
Uh-huh

03:33.880 --> 03:36.520
It made me feel seen

03:36.520 --> 03:37.800
It was really, really cool

03:37.800 --> 03:40.120
I did see the design and it looks fantastic

03:40.120 --> 03:41.320
It looks fantastic

03:42.040 --> 03:43.800
And so that's awesome

03:43.800 --> 03:44.280
Yes

03:44.280 --> 03:49.960
I'm really happy for you and that's a really awesome piece of work to have been created

03:50.920 --> 03:53.640
I have some issues with your correspondence cage

03:53.640 --> 03:54.360
What about it?

03:54.360 --> 03:55.320
Not a fan

03:55.320 --> 03:57.240
What, what, what, don't you like about it?

03:57.240 --> 03:58.760
Second, I have another problem

03:58.760 --> 04:00.360
Was to open the lock

04:00.360 --> 04:01.080
No, I got the sound effect

04:01.080 --> 04:01.880
Click, yeah

04:01.880 --> 04:05.720
I have another problem and that is you're naming someone a raptor princess

04:05.720 --> 04:06.120
Yes

04:06.120 --> 04:08.680
And you're not telling me in advance, so I don't have the clip here

04:08.680 --> 04:09.240
I don't know

04:09.240 --> 04:09.880
I don't have the drop

04:09.880 --> 04:13.160
I can't just tell you to play a raptor princess clip

04:13.160 --> 04:17.560
I feel like that's something that you have to also choose to do

04:17.560 --> 04:19.640
Well, see, this is what we really need to talk about

04:19.640 --> 04:21.640
And that is you should have made your own drop

04:21.640 --> 04:23.080
Yes, I should have made my own drop

04:23.080 --> 04:25.640
If you're naming someone a raptor princess, you need to come

04:25.640 --> 04:29.240
If you're coming in with the correspondence cage sound effect

04:29.240 --> 04:30.760
You really should have your own drop

04:30.760 --> 04:33.800
I understand, you're right, I should have my own set of drops entirely

04:33.800 --> 04:34.600
Uh-huh

04:34.600 --> 04:35.080
Yes

04:35.080 --> 04:36.280
I think that's a good idea

04:36.280 --> 04:37.480
You really want to annoy me

04:37.480 --> 04:42.600
If you really want to escalate this arms race of annoying each other, that is the way to go

04:42.600 --> 04:44.760
That would be a great, that would be a great decision

04:44.760 --> 04:46.280
So is that crannot, is that right?

04:46.280 --> 04:47.960
Yes, crannot or craynot

04:47.960 --> 04:48.440
Okay

04:48.440 --> 04:51.240
Not sure the, it was a correspondence

04:51.240 --> 04:54.280
And yeah, it's tough to know how vowels are long or short

04:54.280 --> 04:54.760
Exactly

04:54.760 --> 04:55.080
Yeah

04:55.080 --> 04:56.200
On the page

04:56.200 --> 04:56.760
Well, thank you

04:56.760 --> 04:57.320
Yes, indeed

04:57.320 --> 05:00.200
On, I know that this is a gift for Jordan, but I'll still thank you

05:00.200 --> 05:01.720
I think it's pretty cool that that exists

05:01.720 --> 05:02.600
Fantastic

05:02.600 --> 05:05.000
So, Jordan, we got an interesting episode to go over today

05:05.000 --> 05:05.640
Yes, we do

05:05.640 --> 05:09.640
And we got a lot of, lot of bullshit, lot of, lot of business to get into

05:09.640 --> 05:12.600
But before we do, uh, let's, uh, take a little moment say thank you

05:12.600 --> 05:14.040
to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show

05:14.040 --> 05:14.920
That's a great idea

05:14.920 --> 05:19.400
So, first, paganfilthisdustin, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:19.400 --> 05:20.280

05:33.160 --> 05:35.880
Thank you! Next, Anna, no last name, no last initial

05:35.880 --> 05:37.720
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:37.720 --> 05:38.840
I'm a policy wonk

05:38.840 --> 05:39.640
Thanks, Anna!

05:39.640 --> 05:44.240
Thank you! Next, Simon Starian Firedoodle, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.640
I'm a policy wonk.

05:45.640 --> 05:49.440
Thank you very much, Mr. Doodle, I believe is what I'm going to be calling him.

05:49.440 --> 05:54.640
Thank you so much. And then, RoCoCoLibertarian, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.240
I'm a policy wonk.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.840
Thank you very much, RoCoCoLibertarian.

05:58.840 --> 06:03.040
Next, Kat, with a K, Kat V, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.440
I'm a policy wonk.

06:04.440 --> 06:05.440
Thanks very much, Kat!

06:05.440 --> 06:10.240
And finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on an elevated level, we appreciate that very much.

06:10.240 --> 06:14.040
So first, Elise Middlefart, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

06:14.040 --> 06:19.240
And, ooh, tough one here, Donald Trump, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.640
I'm a policy wonk.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.640
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.240
How's your 401k doing, bro?

06:25.240 --> 06:28.040
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

06:28.040 --> 06:29.240
Let's just get down to business.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.240
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.040
Why are you pimps so good?

06:33.040 --> 06:35.040
My neck is freakishly large.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.640
I declare info war on you.

06:37.640 --> 06:40.240
Thank you so much, Elise Middlefart, and thank you so much, Donald Trump.

06:40.240 --> 06:49.240
Yes, quite a situation for him to be like, well, the only way to take down the GOP people who are betraying me is to donate to knowledge fights.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.240
Yeah, that'll do it.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.240
That'll get him.

06:52.240 --> 06:56.640
So, Jordan, today I found myself in a little bit of an interesting pickley conundrum.

06:56.640 --> 06:57.240
Sure.

06:57.240 --> 07:03.640
And that is that Thanksgiving happened and Alex was out of studio for the end of the week.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.240
Sure.

07:04.240 --> 07:11.240
And so in terms of us coming back with something from Alex's oeuvre seemed like it was gonna be a difficulty.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.240
Owen Troyer was in studio filling in.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.240
Ugh.

07:14.240 --> 07:21.240
I guess we could have maybe forced something out of like Alex's little, you know, hey how you doing videos.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.240
Sure, sure.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.240
Standing in front of a lake yelling about something or other.

07:24.240 --> 07:27.240
But I just wasn't interested.

07:27.240 --> 07:31.240
And so I thought like now is the time we gotta get wacky.

07:31.240 --> 07:32.240
It's a wacky Monday.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.240
It's time.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.240
It's been a while.

07:34.240 --> 07:43.240
What we thankfully have is I think that Carrie Cassidy, Swery Carrie, over at Project Camelot has given up on her paywall format.

07:43.240 --> 07:54.240
I don't know if that's because enough people were generous or if, I don't know what the deal is, but these videos are all very available and I've not had to log into anything to get them.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.240
I think Carrie missed our episode.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.240
It's possible.

07:57.240 --> 08:02.240
I think Swery Carrie was like, if they're never gonna do an episode on me again, I better make these free.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.240
She missed us.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.240
She missed the thing we've got.

08:05.240 --> 08:08.240
So I guess there are anybody, you know, who's sort of newer to the show.

08:08.240 --> 08:19.240
Whenever we need to take a break from Alex Jones, we like to look into the world of Project Camelot, which is a YouTube channel run by a lady we call Swery Carrie who interviews space weirdos.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.240
Yep.

08:20.240 --> 08:26.240
Various super soldiers, people who have been to Mars, people who are psychics.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.240
She is a psychic herself.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.240
Of course.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.240
She hangs out with this guy named Mark Richards.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.240
A little bit Pleiadian, but not a ton.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.240
Well, maybe.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.240
Maybe.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.240
It's debatable.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.240
Someone told her that who might be a racist alien.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.240
He was definitely a racist alien.

08:39.240 --> 08:41.240
And then he became Death.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.240
That'll happen.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.240
The Archangel Abaddon.

08:43.240 --> 08:44.240
That's true.

08:44.240 --> 08:47.240
There's a lot of lore here.

08:47.240 --> 08:57.240
Her main source of information, her big sort of whistleblower is this guy named Mark Richards who is a murderer who was framed for murder because he was off planet at the time.

08:57.240 --> 08:58.240
Well.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.240
He was a sentient spaceship Minerva.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.240
Indeed.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.240
And his friends in the raptor beings.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.240
Right.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.240
Right, right, right.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.240
Doing a mission of some sort.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.240
Just to be clear, we didn't make this up.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.240
Nope.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.240
This is stuff we've learned.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.240
This is stuff we've learned.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.240
We've observed this in the wild.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.240
Yeah.

09:15.240 --> 09:20.240
So, unfortunately over the time that we have looked at this, it was supposed to be just a pressure release valve.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.240
Of course.

09:21.240 --> 09:24.240
We've come to realize that Carrie is also very into QAnon.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.240
They are dovetailing together our two shows.

09:26.240 --> 09:29.240
And that kind of took a little bit of the charm away from it.

09:29.240 --> 09:32.240
But, sometimes you still just need a hit.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.240
You gotta go to the well.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.240
Yeah.

09:34.240 --> 09:39.240
So today, Jordan, we're going to be looking at a video that was released on Project Camelot on November 12th.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.240
Which is a little bit of an election Q&A.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.240
Okay.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.240
Post-election Q&A.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.240
Alright.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.240
Okay.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.240
You probably have some Q's.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.240
I got some Q's.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.240
Carrie's got some A's.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.240
Out of CVAs.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.240
Here's her introduction.

09:51.240 --> 09:52.240
Hi everyone.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.240
I'm Carrie Cassidy from Project Camelot.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.240
Hi Carrie.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.240
So, very happy to be here today.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.240
But my guest didn't show up.

09:59.240 --> 10:04.240
So, I guess she had some conflict or other and we'll have to reschedule.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.240
I'm not sure what's going on there.

10:06.240 --> 10:14.240
Anyway, so, I just thought I'd do a Q&A if that's useful.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.240
I love it.

10:15.240 --> 10:20.240
Now, I want to say that I do not think anything is bad about a guest canceling.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.240
That shit happens.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.240
No, no.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:23.240 --> 10:30.240
I only left that introduction in because it is the setup for a punchline later.

10:30.240 --> 10:33.240
And I don't want to turn this show into a thing where you're yelling bingo all the time.

10:33.240 --> 10:34.240
Okay, I'm not going to try and yell bingo all the time.

10:34.240 --> 10:38.240
But I would like to see if you can figure out where the payoff to that joke is.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.240
Okay, alright.

10:39.240 --> 10:40.240
I think you'll be able to figure it out.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.240
Is the guest that cancelled actually her?

10:42.240 --> 10:43.240
No.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.240
Is this a Fight Club scenario?

10:44.240 --> 10:45.240
No, no, no, no.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.240
Alright.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.240
But there is definitely something that's like, wait a second.

10:48.240 --> 10:51.240
There's literally no way this guest should have ever cancelled.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.240
You'll see once it happens.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.240
Okay.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.240
Alright.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.240
So, a Q&A would be nice.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.240
Certainly, like I said, you got Qs, Carrie's got As.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.240
Of course.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.240
But it turns out this is even more than just a Q&A.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.240
Alright.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.240
This, what she started down this road.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.240
A Q-Anon-Anay.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.240
Ooh.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.240
There's a lot going on.

11:07.240 --> 11:18.240
I can say that, in general, I did have a precog dream last night, finally, about the outcome

11:18.240 --> 11:19.240
so far.

11:19.240 --> 11:22.240
It's an interesting dream that I had.

11:22.240 --> 11:27.240
So, maybe I'll just share that and then you can go ahead and ask questions about whatever.

11:27.240 --> 11:32.240
So, when I hear a caller on the Alex Jones show talk about their dreams.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.240
Yes.

11:33.240 --> 11:34.240
Not interested.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.240
Uh-uh.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.240
Boring.

11:36.240 --> 11:39.240
When I hear Swery Carrie open up the show saying, I had a precognitive dream, finally,

11:39.240 --> 11:40.240
about the election.

11:40.240 --> 11:41.240
Fire in my heart.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.240
Fire in my heart.

11:42.240 --> 11:46.240
I had a precog dream several days after the election, finally.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.240
About what's going to happen here.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.240
The election, yes.

11:49.240 --> 11:54.240
And so, she gets into that right at the beginning, right at the top, and it turns out that she's

11:54.240 --> 11:59.240
a good storyteller, because she sets the scene for what was going on before the dream.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.240
Sure, sure.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.240
In order to give you some context.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.240
She had spicy foods?

12:03.240 --> 12:04.240
Maybe.

12:04.240 --> 12:11.240
That might be the truth behind the words she's using, but I'll leave that to the Pleiadians

12:11.240 --> 12:13.240
to know for sure.

12:13.240 --> 12:21.240
So, my dream, basically, was, and I had a very, they were shooting a 5G at me last night,

12:21.240 --> 12:27.240
so, I know Trump doesn't have complete control over scalar weapons that are being used, and

12:27.240 --> 12:29.240
so on and so forth.

12:29.240 --> 12:35.240
So, I was up most of the night, on and off, and then finally fell asleep, I think, around

12:35.240 --> 12:37.240
6 or so AM.

12:37.240 --> 12:42.240
So, I mean, look, she was having 5G shot at her.

12:42.240 --> 12:45.240
Scalar laser 5G attack.

12:45.240 --> 12:51.240
No, I understand, and she was saying that, and I get that, fine, you were having 5G shot

12:51.240 --> 12:54.240
at you, that's a happening.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.240
Sure.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.240
How did she know?

12:56.240 --> 12:59.240
Because she didn't say what the effects of having 5G shot at.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.240
She has 5G sensors.

13:00.240 --> 13:05.240
No, apparently, not being able to fall asleep is a sign of 5G attack.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.240
That's it.

13:06.240 --> 13:09.240
Well, I mean, I've certainly been someone who's struggled with insomnia at periods in

13:09.240 --> 13:10.240
my life.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.240
Sure, sure.

13:11.240 --> 13:14.240
A lot of times, I still, it takes me a long time to fall asleep.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.240
It's frustrating.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.240
It sucks.

13:16.240 --> 13:20.240
I have friends who'd be like, I lay down, and two minutes later I'm out, and I get mad

13:20.240 --> 13:21.240
at them.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.240
I'm furious.

13:22.240 --> 13:25.240
Because it'll take me an hour and a half, at least, usually, of just laying there to

13:25.240 --> 13:26.240
fall asleep.

13:26.240 --> 13:31.240
And it sucks, but if I could imagine that I was under 5G scalar attack, that'd probably

13:31.240 --> 13:32.240
be more exciting.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.240
Or it might make it harder.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.240
It would up the drama.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.240
I feel like it would make it impossible to sleep.

13:36.240 --> 13:39.240
Yeah, because then I'm like, oh no, 5G.

13:39.240 --> 13:44.240
Instead of going to bed at midnight and falling asleep at two, you fall asleep at six, and

13:44.240 --> 13:46.740
you're worried about 5G attacks the whole time.

13:46.740 --> 13:48.240
Yeah, maybe I'm glad I don't think this.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.240
I think that's a good idea.

13:49.240 --> 13:50.240
Yeah.

13:50.240 --> 13:53.240
Now, the problem is, I've been outside your window with my phone pointed at you every

13:53.240 --> 13:55.240
night, so that's why you've been having trouble sleeping.

13:55.240 --> 13:58.240
Does your phone have that app, the 5G shooting app?

13:58.240 --> 13:59.240
It does.

13:59.240 --> 14:00.240
Wow.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.240
Well, it actually emerges from a compartment in my phone.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.240
That's important.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.240
Yes.

14:05.240 --> 14:06.240
Your Dalek phone.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.240
Yep.

14:07.240 --> 14:10.240
So this is the setting of the dream, 5G attack all night.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.240
Of course.

14:11.240 --> 14:15.240
And then she gets to sleep at around six in the morning, and here is part of the dream.

14:15.240 --> 14:23.240
And then I had this dream in which I saw the television, and Trump had taken it over and

14:23.240 --> 14:32.240
was showing, actually, individuals and indictments and individuals that had actually been killed

14:32.240 --> 14:39.240
part of their indictments in, I guess, a military tribunal type of situation.

14:39.240 --> 14:43.240
And it was all being announced to the entire public.

14:43.240 --> 14:53.240
And I was very happy because these individuals were very dark and involved in hurting children

14:53.240 --> 14:58.240
and the children in the underground bases, adrenochrome and all of that.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.240
Sure.

14:59.240 --> 15:00.240
Of course.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.240
So that was the dream.

15:01.240 --> 15:04.240
It was like a little movie.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.240
It's quite a dream.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.240
Quite a dream.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.240
Carrie's a...

15:07.240 --> 15:11.240
If I were a dream analyst, if you will.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.240
She's dreaming about stuff she's read on blogs.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.240
I wouldn't go with precog.

15:14.240 --> 15:17.240
I would go with, you've got some really violent fantasies, lady.

15:17.240 --> 15:23.240
Well, I think that she's tapping into the zeitgeist of a lot of the online extreme right.

15:23.240 --> 15:28.240
Like, these are the sort of fantasies that get trafficked on message boards, and even

15:28.240 --> 15:30.240
people like Alex engage in.

15:30.240 --> 15:38.240
This idea of Trump righteously taking over and killing their enemies is what they desperately

15:38.240 --> 15:39.240
want.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.240
Yeah.

15:40.240 --> 15:44.240
You know, I get bloodthirst to a point, you know.

15:44.240 --> 15:49.240
Somebody was, whatever nonsense somebody wrote in like the Atlantic or something where it's

15:49.240 --> 15:52.240
like, but we don't want to see Trump dragged from the White House.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.240
Are you talking about Friedersdorf again?

15:53.240 --> 15:55.240
No, I'm not talking about Friedersdorf.

15:55.240 --> 15:58.240
The American people don't want to see Trump taken away from the White House.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.240
He needs to concede like an adult.

15:59.240 --> 16:03.240
And part of me is just sitting there going like, no, I would like to see him dragged

16:03.240 --> 16:04.240
out by his hair.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.240
I would like to see him dragged through the streets.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.240
That would be great.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.240
That's a little bloodthirst.

16:07.240 --> 16:08.240
I get it.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.240
I get it.

16:09.240 --> 16:12.240
I don't think it will, I don't think it's a good idea, actually.

16:12.240 --> 16:16.240
I think the consequences of it are so much worse than whatever catharsis you get out

16:16.240 --> 16:17.240
of it.

16:17.240 --> 16:18.240
Exactly, right?

16:18.240 --> 16:20.240
I can have that second level of thought.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.240
I don't have the like, nope, the end bloodthirst.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.240
That's all I need.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.240
Yeah.

16:25.240 --> 16:28.240
It's like, okay, let's imagine a scenario where Trump does take over broadcast television

16:28.240 --> 16:31.240
and announces like he's killed all of his enemies.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.240
Like, what happens next?

16:34.240 --> 16:37.240
What the fuck kind of world are we living in?

16:37.240 --> 16:41.240
Where the president is just like, I've taken over all beads of communication.

16:41.240 --> 16:45.240
Well, just so you guys know, killed everybody.

16:45.240 --> 16:46.240
I killed almost everybody.

16:46.240 --> 16:50.240
Bill Gates got away on a white horse.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.240
Too pale for me, guys.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.240
Too pale for my blood.

16:54.240 --> 17:01.240
So Carrie's talking real specifically about a person who has been killed in this dream.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.240
Sure.

17:02.240 --> 17:03.240
I'm not sure.

17:03.240 --> 17:07.240
I'm looking, I'm scanning the chat right now, and I'm not sure what some of these questions

17:07.240 --> 17:08.240
refer to.

17:08.240 --> 17:13.240
If you're referring to my dream, the details were very visual.

17:13.240 --> 17:21.240
So like I said, there was television on, I was seeing it, it was literally, the part

17:21.240 --> 17:31.240
that it was on was a particular person who had been killed as part of the sort of, I

17:31.240 --> 17:37.240
don't know, whatever you want to call it, indictments and certainly payback for his

17:37.240 --> 17:39.240
crimes against humanity.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.240
She doesn't say who?

17:41.240 --> 17:42.240
She never says who?

17:42.240 --> 17:43.240
No.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.240
That's bullshit.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.240
She had a dream, it was visual, so she saw the person.

17:46.240 --> 17:47.240
Yeah, she had to have.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.240
Conceivably.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.240
And she knows that person's crimes.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.240
Well, it's against humanity.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.240
Yeah.

17:51.240 --> 17:54.240
I would say that it's either gotta be Soros or Bill Gates, right?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.240
I'm gonna go with Stelter all the way.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.240
No, she doesn't hate Stelter nearly as much.

17:57.240 --> 18:01.240
I think Stelter is in the dreams of all right-leaning people.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.240
That's his power?

18:02.240 --> 18:03.240
Yes, exactly.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.240
That's his demon clown power?

18:04.240 --> 18:06.240
Yeah, yeah, Stelter on 39th Street.

18:06.240 --> 18:08.240
I don't think it's Stelter.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.240
Stelter on Elm Street.

18:09.240 --> 18:10.240
I don't know, man.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.240
I don't know.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.240
Maybe it's not a human.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.240
Maybe it's a raptor.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.240
It could be a raptor.

18:15.240 --> 18:16.240
Whoa.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.240
What if it's an alien?

18:18.240 --> 18:19.240
Holy shit.

18:19.240 --> 18:22.240
It has to be an alien wearing a human face, though.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.240
It doesn't have to be.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.240
Oh, that's a good point.

18:24.240 --> 18:27.240
Yeah, because once Trump takes over the TV news and talks about how he's killed all his

18:27.240 --> 18:29.240
enemies, it could be like, and some of them.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.240
Ooh, man.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.240
Take it one level.

18:32.240 --> 18:33.240
Some of them are reptiles.

18:33.240 --> 18:37.240
Look, it's fucked up if all of a sudden we hear that Trump killed all of his enemies,

18:37.240 --> 18:43.240
but if at the same time he finds out that aliens are real, and he's killed aliens,

18:43.240 --> 18:46.240
and we've got intergalactic treaties going on.

18:46.240 --> 18:49.240
But Ike is now my Surgeon General.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.240
What?

18:50.240 --> 18:52.240
Nobody else can handle these raptor surgeries.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.240
Gee.

18:53.240 --> 18:58.240
So anyway, this person that she's talking about has been killed already in the dream.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.240
Sure.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.240
But she won't say who it is, and it's really frustrating.

19:01.240 --> 19:06.240
It was interesting because it was literally about the fact that they already killed the

19:06.240 --> 19:07.240
person.

19:07.240 --> 19:13.240
So that seems quite adventurous to come forward in that way.

19:13.240 --> 19:14.240
It does.

19:14.240 --> 19:20.240
But that, in theory, is the plan, and they have said that they have killed certain people,

19:20.240 --> 19:23.240
or it has been put out there.

19:23.240 --> 19:27.240
Now, Trump, of course, has not said this yet.

19:27.240 --> 19:35.240
So this was an official report, and it was clear that he had commandeered a television

19:35.240 --> 19:39.240
station or maybe, and took the internet down.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.240
No, but it was an official report in the dream.

19:41.240 --> 19:42.240
In the dream it was official.

19:42.240 --> 19:45.240
I understand, but don't say official report in the dream.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.240
Oh, so Trump took down the internet?

19:47.240 --> 19:48.240
How fucking scary is this?

19:48.240 --> 19:50.240
He just took it down.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.240
How scary is this?

19:51.240 --> 19:55.240
And how much does this fit all of your nightmare versions of what the Democrats are trying

19:55.240 --> 19:56.240
to-

19:56.240 --> 19:58.240
No, this is a fantasy fulfillment dream.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.240
Right.

19:59.240 --> 20:04.240
Trump has taken down all of the internet, controls at least one TV station-

20:04.240 --> 20:05.240
He's seized communications.

20:05.240 --> 20:06.240
He's murdering people.

20:06.240 --> 20:10.240
He's crippled your ability to communicate with your audiences and your communities.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.240
And I'm so happy.

20:11.240 --> 20:12.240
Great.

20:12.240 --> 20:15.240
So this might've been a vision, this dream.

20:15.240 --> 20:19.240
It might've been a dream, might've been a vision, probably a dream, probably a vision.

20:19.240 --> 20:26.240
He says, or they say, the QAnon and so on and so forth, the philosophy behind it is

20:26.240 --> 20:28.240
they want to show people.

20:28.240 --> 20:32.240
So my last video I said, okay, fine, show us.

20:32.240 --> 20:35.240
In other words, don't talk about showing us, show us.

20:35.240 --> 20:40.240
I get the sense that there is a possibility that what she's trying to say is that her

20:40.240 --> 20:43.240
dream was a vision that was granted by Q.

20:43.240 --> 20:47.240
I am expecting something along those lines.

20:47.240 --> 20:56.240
It sounds to me a little bit like there is a belief that Q can give you dreams.

20:56.240 --> 20:59.240
How long can you wait on the whole-

20:59.240 --> 21:00.240
For a vision from Q?

21:00.240 --> 21:01.240
Well, not just that.

21:01.240 --> 21:05.240
Well, I mean, obviously you can wait a long time for a vision from Q.

21:05.240 --> 21:12.240
But, okay, she said last week, the philosophy behind Q is show people, which, bananas thing

21:12.240 --> 21:15.240
to say about Q considering its track record.

21:15.240 --> 21:18.240
But how are you still waiting?

21:18.240 --> 21:22.240
Does she think the dream, she thinks the dream is a response to her saying show me what's

21:22.240 --> 21:23.240
going on.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.240
Yes.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.240
Oh my God, we're all going to die.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.240
Yeah.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.240
And this is also two weeks ago, so this shit has not happened.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.240
Oh boy.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.240
Happened yet.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.240
I think she did it.

21:31.240 --> 21:34.240
This sucks because, okay, you don't have to yell bingo because the bingo is going to be

21:34.240 --> 21:35.240
in this clip.

21:35.240 --> 21:36.240
Okay.

21:36.240 --> 21:37.240
There's no other way for me to set this up without it being obvious.

21:37.240 --> 21:38.240
All right.

21:38.240 --> 21:39.240
Okay.

21:39.240 --> 21:40.240
I gotcha.

21:40.240 --> 21:41.240
I gotcha.

21:41.240 --> 21:45.240
But afterwards, I'd like you to explain to me why this is the punchline to the joke of

21:45.240 --> 21:46.240
the guest canceling.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.240
Okay.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.240
My guest, who was supposed to be here, she is actually-

21:50.240 --> 21:51.240
The gate of gates?

21:51.240 --> 21:58.240
An interesting woman, and she considers herself something of a time traveler.

21:58.240 --> 22:03.240
She is also involved in researching, I guess, CV.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.240
I'm not going to say the name.

22:05.240 --> 22:09.240
And her book is going to be about that.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.240
So, hopefully, we can get her back.

22:11.240 --> 22:15.240
She was on my show a few years ago.

22:15.240 --> 22:19.240
So, why is it really fucked up that this guest missed the show?

22:19.240 --> 22:25.240
Dan, if you are a time traveler, it seems like you would, at the very least, be able

22:25.240 --> 22:27.240
to make plenty of things on time.

22:27.240 --> 22:29.240
You would never miss an appointment if you're a time traveler.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.240
It really doesn't seem...

22:30.240 --> 22:34.240
I mean, maybe you can't use time travel for this kind of mundanity, you know?

22:34.240 --> 22:39.240
She had to go to get her hair appointment.

22:39.240 --> 22:46.240
I would suggest that if you're somebody who has power over time and space and can manipulate

22:46.240 --> 22:52.240
it to whatever extent you can, to the point where people say that you fancy yourself a

22:52.240 --> 22:57.240
time traveler, I think that time is something that's on your mind.

22:57.240 --> 23:04.240
I think that punctuality is probably a priority for you, even if your talents are imaginary.

23:04.240 --> 23:08.240
I think I take issue with something here.

23:08.240 --> 23:13.240
I think I let it go by the first time, but can you fancy yourself a time traveler?

23:13.240 --> 23:14.240
Yeah.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.240
You see, it seems like you either are or are not.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.240
I fancy myself a man about town.

23:18.240 --> 23:22.240
Now I understand that, but this is a little bit different.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.240
How great did I never leave the apartment?

23:23.240 --> 23:25.240
A man about town is very subjective.

23:25.240 --> 23:28.240
Well, I also never leave the apartment, so I am not.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.240
Do you leave this time?

23:29.240 --> 23:31.240
No, I don't.

23:31.240 --> 23:34.240
Okay, well then you are neither a man about town nor a time traveler.

23:34.240 --> 23:39.240
Yeah, I think that your instinct to let that go is good because I don't know if you're

23:39.240 --> 23:41.240
ever going to get to any further truth on it.

23:41.240 --> 23:42.240
I like it.

23:42.240 --> 23:49.240
Now, I will say that with this person who thinks they're time travel or who has a book

23:49.240 --> 23:52.240
coming out about COVID, that book should have come out three years ago.

23:52.240 --> 23:56.240
You would think, again, time travel being what it is.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.240
Yeah.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.240
Couldn't you have written a book to warn us about COVID?

23:59.240 --> 24:00.240
Exactly.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.240
Yes.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.240
And Carrie says that she was on the show a couple years ago.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.240
When it would have made sense.

24:04.240 --> 24:07.240
That episode had better been all about COVID.

24:07.240 --> 24:11.240
Yeah, that would be a good one to go back and check if she was like, in three years

24:11.240 --> 24:13.240
I'm going to write a book about this shit, but just so you know.

24:13.240 --> 24:15.240
Otherwise, I have some questions.

24:15.240 --> 24:16.240
Yeah.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.240
We'll check in on that and see.

24:17.240 --> 24:19.240
What are you time traveling to do?

24:19.240 --> 24:20.240
Have fun.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.240
Well, that is a good reason to time travel.

24:22.240 --> 24:23.240
Yeah.

24:23.240 --> 24:27.240
I mean, there's certain sporting events that, I mean, obviously the classic thing is like,

24:27.240 --> 24:28.240
gamble on them.

24:28.240 --> 24:29.240
Sure.

24:29.240 --> 24:32.240
But if you could go watch some amazing moments from like-

24:32.240 --> 24:33.240
Totally.

24:33.240 --> 24:36.240
Just feel the catharsis of this crowd just freaking out.

24:36.240 --> 24:37.240
Right, right, right.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.240
That'd be kind of fun.

24:38.240 --> 24:39.240
Yeah.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.240
I don't know.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.240
Watch Jesse Owens run.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.240
Yeah.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.240
That'd be great.

24:43.240 --> 24:44.240
Shove it in Hitler's fucking face.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.240
So this guest didn't show up.

24:46.240 --> 24:47.240
Mm-hmm.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.240
And they should have because they're time traveling.

24:49.240 --> 24:51.240
But Kerry mentions another guest.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.240
Someone asks a question about Robert David Steele.

24:54.240 --> 24:55.240
Mm-hmm.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.240
Who is, of course, a real weirdo.

24:57.240 --> 25:00.240
He has a lot of irons and many fires.

25:00.240 --> 25:01.240
True.

25:01.240 --> 25:02.240
He-

25:02.240 --> 25:04.240
Does not, however, fancy himself a time traveler.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.240
No.

25:05.240 --> 25:10.240
However, he was the guy who was on Alex Jones' show and talked about how the globalists are

25:10.240 --> 25:13.240
kidnapping children and taking them to bases in space.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.240
Yep.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.240
And enslaving them.

25:15.240 --> 25:18.240
And then Alex got mad that everybody thought he believed it because-

25:18.240 --> 25:19.240
He said, yep.

25:19.240 --> 25:20.240
I believe you.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.240
You are correct 100%.

25:22.240 --> 25:25.240
And then Robert David Steele did not get invited back on Alex's show.

25:25.240 --> 25:26.240
I'm surprised.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.240
But he comes around Project Camelot from time to time.

25:28.240 --> 25:30.240
This clip is very confusing.

25:30.240 --> 25:32.240
I'd like you to listen to this.

25:32.240 --> 25:37.240
And I think we have a little bit more to this story about Robert David Steele.

25:37.240 --> 25:38.240
Okay.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.240
I'm very interested in what's going on in his life.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.240
All right.

25:41.240 --> 25:48.240
You know, I understand that Benjamin Fulford has come forward saying that Robert David

25:48.240 --> 25:50.240
Steele should be the candidate.

25:50.240 --> 25:56.240
You know, I actually haven't seen the post, but this is kind of outrageous.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.240
This.

25:57.240 --> 26:01.240
He is always working under the orders of the triad.

26:01.240 --> 26:06.240
And I have one video going back.

26:06.240 --> 26:10.240
But first of all, the original video I did with him where he states what happened to

26:10.240 --> 26:16.240
him, where he was threatened, and so on, and had to basically.

26:16.240 --> 26:21.240
I think if he wants to stay in Japan and stay alive, he has to do what they say.

26:21.240 --> 26:26.240
So now he's coming out against Trump, strangely.

26:26.240 --> 26:30.240
So apparently Robert David Steele has turned on Trump, which I didn't know about, mostly

26:30.240 --> 26:31.240
because I don't care.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.240
Right, right, right.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.240
I'm not going to follow along with what he has to think.

26:34.240 --> 26:38.240
Far more interestingly, he lives in Japan, and in order to stay alive, he has to do the

26:38.240 --> 26:39.240
bidding of the triad.

26:39.240 --> 26:45.240
See, now, I wrote that down, and I'm struggling to really comprehend this, so if I understand

26:45.240 --> 26:49.240
correctly, let me read exactly what I wrote down.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.240
Works for the triad in Japan.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.240
Now, that's Robert who?

26:53.240 --> 26:54.240
David Steele.

26:54.240 --> 26:55.240
Robert David Steele.

26:55.240 --> 26:59.240
Former CIA agent, yeah.

26:59.240 --> 27:00.240
I don't know if he was actually in the CIA.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.240
I think that's just what he said.

27:01.240 --> 27:02.240
Yeah.

27:02.240 --> 27:03.240
Is that a move up for him?

27:03.240 --> 27:04.240
Probably.

27:04.240 --> 27:05.240
I don't know.

27:05.240 --> 27:06.240
Look, dude, here's the thing.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.240
I've listened to a lot of Project Camelot.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.240
I don't know who the fuck the triad are.

27:10.240 --> 27:11.240
I'm not sure.

27:11.240 --> 27:12.240
Not sure.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.240
This is a new wrinkle.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.240
There's a triad.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.240
She could have said Yakuza, but now there's a triad.

27:17.240 --> 27:18.240
I think they're aliens.

27:18.240 --> 27:19.240
Right?

27:19.240 --> 27:20.240
I mean, it's got to be a trio of aliens.

27:20.240 --> 27:24.240
It has to be, well, I hope it's at least a trio.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.240
Otherwise, now we're in real trouble.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.240
Yeah, this is confusing.

27:26.240 --> 27:29.240
I don't like this sort of late reveal of-

27:29.240 --> 27:32.240
How long has he been in Japan?

27:32.240 --> 27:38.240
Look, every time I've ever seen him, he's been in the same study just inside.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.240
He always is by Skype from places.

27:40.240 --> 27:43.240
He's always in this very nice looking study.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.240
Sure.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.240
Wonderful wood shelves and tons of books.

27:46.240 --> 27:50.240
Maybe he just got one of those backgrounds that's like a Shinto temple, and she's like,

27:50.240 --> 27:52.240
oh, well, he obviously lives in Japan now.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.240
Oh, maybe.

27:53.240 --> 27:58.240
I don't know, because I've also listened to Robert David Steele's interview with Carrie.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.240
I don't know.

27:59.240 --> 28:02.680
I haven't listened to all of them because I've done a couple, but I don't remember the

28:02.680 --> 28:03.960
triad coming up.

28:03.960 --> 28:05.480
I don't remember Japan coming up.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.240
I don't remember any of this.

28:07.240 --> 28:09.240
I want to know who the triad is.

28:09.240 --> 28:12.240
I want to know what they're doing with Robert David Steele.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.240
I don't think you can just toss that in there.

28:14.240 --> 28:15.240
No, apparently you can't.

28:15.240 --> 28:18.240
Just toss in Robert David Steele works for the triad.

28:18.240 --> 28:19.240
Works for the triad, man.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.240
In order to stay alive.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.240
Right.

28:21.240 --> 28:22.240
Yes.

28:22.240 --> 28:27.240
So the Illuminati, we know that they're pretty involved in politics.

28:27.240 --> 28:28.240
Usually.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.240
And they're pushing back about this election.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.240
Okay.

28:32.240 --> 28:38.240
Right now, there's a great deal of evidence of Illuminati pushback.

28:38.240 --> 28:42.240
So I want to stop this really quick, because one of the things that Carrie gets really

28:42.240 --> 28:47.240
upset about, not really super upset, like not freaking out or anything, but she seems

28:47.240 --> 28:53.240
to be bummed out that people are not taking seriously the people who talk about these

28:53.240 --> 28:56.240
allegations of widespread fraud.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.240
Sure.

28:57.240 --> 29:02.240
But I would like to say that what she does in this clip is one of the reasons that no

29:02.240 --> 29:04.240
one takes these people seriously.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.240
Okay.

29:05.240 --> 29:12.240
I got a call this morning from someone, one of my sources, who said that, I think it's

29:12.240 --> 29:18.240
Arizona, that the governor has come forward and said, oh, there's not enough votes to

29:18.240 --> 29:21.240
really cause a recount.

29:21.240 --> 29:25.240
And so that governor has obviously been threatened.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.240
Obviously.

29:26.240 --> 29:32.240
Has gone on the side of the Illuminati, even though I think I have it right.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.240
Arizona is the right person.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.240
Arizona is the right person.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.240
I'm not sure.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.240
Dr. Arizona.

29:39.240 --> 29:44.240
What I'm saying is that some governor, and I heard it was a Republican governor, I thought

29:44.240 --> 29:49.240
Arizona had a Democrat in the office, but I could be wrong.

29:49.240 --> 29:52.240
Anyone in the chat can let me know which it is.

29:52.240 --> 29:53.240
Do they have a governor?

29:53.240 --> 29:55.240
Because then I might have the state wrong.

29:55.240 --> 30:00.240
But this is what came out this morning via source.

30:00.240 --> 30:01.240
And it's out in the news.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.240
Yeah.

30:02.240 --> 30:03.240
Not a lot of details there.

30:03.240 --> 30:06.240
Not a lot of sort of familiarity with the topic.

30:06.240 --> 30:10.240
I don't really know if it's a Republican or a Democrat or what they're talking about or

30:10.240 --> 30:12.240
why, but I do know there's fraud.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.240
Yeah.

30:13.240 --> 30:16.240
Like, I guess if you're mad that no one's taking that seriously, I would suggest that

30:16.240 --> 30:18.240
you're not taking that seriously.

30:18.240 --> 30:21.240
And that's why I'm not going to respond seriously to it.

30:21.240 --> 30:22.240
Yeah.

30:22.240 --> 30:23.240
That would make sense.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.240
Come on.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.240
I think it's Arizona.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.240
Maybe somebody said something.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.240
Yeah.

30:27.240 --> 30:28.240
What the fuck?

30:28.240 --> 30:29.240
Also, fuck off.

30:29.240 --> 30:32.240
You can't care about recounts.

30:32.240 --> 30:35.240
There are aliens that are real fighting everywhere.

30:35.240 --> 30:36.240
Yeah.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.240
That is an issue for me, too.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.240
Why do you care about electoral politics?

30:40.240 --> 30:41.240
At all.

30:41.240 --> 30:45.240
If Biden wins or if Trump wins, there's still fucking space raptors.

30:45.240 --> 30:46.240
Yeah, exactly.

30:46.240 --> 30:51.240
Who are always among us and who have treaties and they're breaking them and remaking them

30:51.240 --> 30:52.240
all day every day.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.240
What does Biden matter?

30:53.240 --> 30:54.240
Yeah.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.240
Doesn't matter at all.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.240
Doesn't matter.

30:56.240 --> 30:57.240
Now, that is true.

30:57.240 --> 30:58.240
That is strange.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.240
Yeah.

30:59.240 --> 31:05.240
But these next two clips, I think, are really the balm that'll go on that burn you're feeling.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.240
Okay.

31:06.240 --> 31:11.240
And that is that like, okay, so this show is kind of nonsensical in the sense that it's

31:11.240 --> 31:15.240
somehow concerned with a democratic politician.

31:15.240 --> 31:16.240
Right.

31:16.240 --> 31:21.240
There's a tremendous amount of information and evidence out there that Biden is not all

31:21.240 --> 31:22.240
there.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.240
Okay.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.240
I guess everyone knows that that watches my shows.

31:25.240 --> 31:29.240
But so that's just like all the other right wing media outlets.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.240
Right.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.240
That's just the same.

31:31.240 --> 31:32.240
Yeah.

31:32.240 --> 31:35.600
But here is why Project Camelot is special.

31:35.600 --> 31:40.700
There's a tremendous amount of information and evidence out there that Biden is not all

31:40.700 --> 31:41.700
there.

31:41.700 --> 31:42.700
Okay.

31:42.700 --> 31:48.400
I guess everyone knows that that watches my shows, but in case you don't, there is reason

31:48.400 --> 31:50.980
to believe that he is a clone.

31:50.980 --> 31:51.980
There we go.

31:51.980 --> 31:52.980
I think that's the stuff.

31:52.980 --> 31:53.980
He is a clone.

31:53.980 --> 31:54.980
He's also a walk-in.

31:54.980 --> 31:55.980
He's a walk-in.

31:55.980 --> 31:56.980
He's a what?

31:56.980 --> 31:57.980
He's a walk-in.

31:57.980 --> 31:58.980
He's a walk-in?

31:58.980 --> 31:59.980
Yeah.

31:59.980 --> 32:00.980
Grow up, man.

32:00.980 --> 32:01.980
He's a walk-in clone?

32:01.980 --> 32:02.980
You don't know about walk-ins?

32:02.980 --> 32:03.980
No, I don't know about walk-ins.

32:03.980 --> 32:04.980
Oh, look at this.

32:04.980 --> 32:06.980
What, did he need a haircut and they just walked him into it?

32:06.980 --> 32:07.980
They're like, ah, you're a clone now.

32:07.980 --> 32:10.980
Look at this fucking kindergartener over here, not knowing about walk-ins.

32:10.980 --> 32:12.640
I don't know what a walk-in is.

32:12.640 --> 32:13.640
Come on, man.

32:13.640 --> 32:14.840
Act like you've been there.

32:14.840 --> 32:16.200
Is he a clone of Christopher Walk-in?

32:16.200 --> 32:17.520
No, I did think that was a possibility.

32:17.520 --> 32:18.520
That'd be great.

32:18.520 --> 32:23.440
Uh, no, so yeah, I mean like, okay, yes, we have a situation where you're talking about

32:23.440 --> 32:27.280
something very standard in right-wing media that Biden's not all there.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.280
He's not all there, Dan.

32:28.280 --> 32:33.640
Now your explanation for it is why I'm tickled, because he's a clone, and not only that, walk-in.

32:33.640 --> 32:35.080
What is a walk-in?

32:35.080 --> 32:36.080
Come on, man.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.080
How are you?

32:37.080 --> 32:39.400
You're really embarrassing yourself.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.840
I'm willing to accept that.

32:40.840 --> 32:41.840
He might be a walk-in.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.440
I don't know what it is.

32:43.440 --> 32:47.440
Well, I can tell you that one of the things that might lead you to believe that he's a

32:47.440 --> 32:51.840
walk-in is if he uses language weirdly.

32:51.840 --> 32:52.840
Sure.

32:52.840 --> 32:59.080
There's one particular clip that's actually quite funny, but also very serious in a certain

32:59.080 --> 33:04.280
sense where he's saying, I am going to be Joe Biden.

33:04.280 --> 33:05.800
That's what he says.

33:05.800 --> 33:12.760
And he says quite a few other things that indicate to me, uh, an alien who hasn't quite

33:12.760 --> 33:14.640
learned the English language.

33:14.640 --> 33:19.880
And so tends to put some words backwards or together that don't belong together.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.840
Wait till I play a clip of you talking.

33:21.840 --> 33:29.360
It could be an AI, but I, my, my instinct tends to say, this is kind of a man in black.

33:29.360 --> 33:33.240
If you didn't know what men in black were supposed to be bodies, I know this is going

33:33.240 --> 33:39.760
to sound, um, unbelievable to some bodies that have been dead and reanimated.

33:39.760 --> 33:46.920
And then, uh, there's basically a walk-in and they get, uh, they behave as if they're

33:46.920 --> 33:47.920
alive.

33:47.920 --> 33:48.920
So that's what a walk-in is.

33:48.920 --> 33:53.400
Apparently it's a dead body that an alien walks into.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.040
I mean, I can't really argue with any of it.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.040
Do aliens walk into a dead body?

33:58.040 --> 33:59.040
Right.

33:59.040 --> 34:00.040
Right.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.040
Right.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.040
Classic set up for a joke.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.040
Of course.

34:03.040 --> 34:04.040
Of course.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.040
That is not what the movie Men in Black was about by the way.

34:05.040 --> 34:06.040
First one says, why the long face?

34:06.040 --> 34:07.040
Second alien says, cause I ripped it in half.

34:07.040 --> 34:08.040
Yeah.

34:08.040 --> 34:13.200
So that's a good explanation for why Biden says things that sound weird sometimes.

34:13.200 --> 34:14.200
Jack.

34:14.200 --> 34:15.200
I just...

34:15.200 --> 34:16.200
Come on, man.

34:16.200 --> 34:17.200
I'm not an alien.

34:17.200 --> 34:18.200
Come on, man.

34:18.200 --> 34:19.200
I'm not a walk-in.

34:19.200 --> 34:20.200
I'm struggling.

34:20.200 --> 34:21.640
I'm struggling with their evidence.

34:21.640 --> 34:23.480
No, it makes total sense.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.040
Has she ever hurt herself?

34:25.040 --> 34:30.600
Like does she think that somebody could not possibly find a, whatever she plays with Biden.

34:30.600 --> 34:33.960
Anytime she's misspoken, it's because someone was shooting 5G at her.

34:33.960 --> 34:34.960
Oh, that's a good point.

34:34.960 --> 34:35.960
Yeah.

34:35.960 --> 34:37.840
So why doesn't Biden get the benefit of that doubt?

34:37.840 --> 34:39.080
Maybe he's being shot at.

34:39.080 --> 34:42.640
But see, you have introduced an interesting question and that is like, Trump misspeaks

34:42.640 --> 34:43.640
a lot too.

34:43.640 --> 34:44.640
Sure.

34:44.640 --> 34:48.060
Now this is where it comes to, this is where the rubber meets the road and actually Kerry

34:48.060 --> 34:49.060
explains it all.

34:49.060 --> 34:50.060
I'm glad.

34:50.060 --> 34:55.820
Now I know that people used to criticize Trump in this regard because Trump sort of uses

34:55.820 --> 35:01.220
language in a certain way, but it's very unique to him and he's communicating.

35:01.220 --> 35:04.800
So it's, you have to have discernment and be able to tell the difference actually.

35:04.800 --> 35:05.800
I hate that word so much.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.720
Well, you hate it because it's the truth.

35:07.720 --> 35:11.800
I hate it because they don't know what it means and they continue saying it over and

35:11.800 --> 35:12.800
over and over again.

35:12.800 --> 35:15.800
So Biden misspeaks and it's proof that there's an alien up in him.

35:15.800 --> 35:16.800
Exactly.

35:16.800 --> 35:17.800
Walked in.

35:17.800 --> 35:18.800
Of course.

35:18.800 --> 35:22.840
Trump misspeaks and it's proof that he's communicating and he's individualistic.

35:22.840 --> 35:23.840
Right.

35:23.840 --> 35:26.800
And the only way to know the difference between the two is discernment, my friend.

35:26.800 --> 35:27.800
All right.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.640
Now let me posit you this theory real quick.

35:29.640 --> 35:30.800
All right.

35:30.800 --> 35:36.720
Alien wise, Biden makes mistakes in the way that we would consider normal.

35:36.720 --> 35:39.440
For sort of an aging person.

35:39.440 --> 35:44.680
In her estimation, based on the way that Trump is talking in a very unique and individualistic

35:44.680 --> 35:49.760
way, then that suggests that Biden is making mistakes in a way that is very common.

35:49.760 --> 35:51.000
Perhaps.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.880
Perhaps.

35:52.880 --> 35:53.880
If that's your comparison.

35:53.880 --> 35:56.680
Well, I mean common for an alien who doesn't know English.

35:56.680 --> 36:01.360
Well, what I would suggest though is that it is more likely the alien is somebody who

36:01.360 --> 36:07.440
is doing something different from what we would consider to be relatively a non unique

36:07.440 --> 36:08.440
behavior.

36:08.440 --> 36:09.440
Can I ask you a question?

36:09.440 --> 36:10.440
Sure.

36:10.440 --> 36:11.440
There's more than one alien, right?

36:11.440 --> 36:12.440
Sure.

36:12.440 --> 36:13.440
That can walk in.

36:13.440 --> 36:14.440
Naturally.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.020
Why would you choose one who doesn't know English?

36:16.020 --> 36:21.960
Like why would you ever choose the alien for that assignment who's weird with English?

36:21.960 --> 36:25.200
I mean, every alien's got to cut its teeth on some assignment.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.440
You know, nobody starts out the most experienced alien walk in.

36:28.440 --> 36:32.320
We need you to possess the fucking president of the United States.

36:32.320 --> 36:35.760
Now it's going to be difficult for you to rise to that rank because you're going to

36:35.760 --> 36:36.760
have to debate.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.600
You're going to have to make a lot of public speeches.

36:38.600 --> 36:39.600
A lot of that.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.200
And you don't know English, which is an issue.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.200
Yeah.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.320
Let's get the fucking alien who doesn't know much English.

36:44.320 --> 36:49.560
Let's get the raptor being who is a little bit iffy on verbs.

36:49.560 --> 36:54.320
Now I like that as a, I think I like that as a like relative place of earthlings in

36:54.320 --> 36:55.320
the universe.

36:55.320 --> 36:59.280
They're like, this is the guys that they haven't even, this is the guys starting out.

36:59.280 --> 37:02.320
This is the new guy who's got to try and take over the president.

37:02.320 --> 37:05.440
He's learning for a more important mission, Dan.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.440
Not at all.

37:06.440 --> 37:07.660
Not at all.

37:07.660 --> 37:11.320
This indicates to me either these aliens are fucking incompetent.

37:11.320 --> 37:12.320
That's fair.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.960
Or they don't actually really want to, they're just fucking around.

37:14.960 --> 37:15.960
They're sort of playful.

37:15.960 --> 37:16.960
I imagine.

37:16.960 --> 37:17.960
That's, that's fair.

37:17.960 --> 37:21.840
Or, I mean, I do know that English is one of those languages that's like notoriously

37:21.840 --> 37:24.600
difficult to learn later in life.

37:24.600 --> 37:25.600
Especially if you're an alien.

37:25.600 --> 37:26.600
Yeah.

37:26.600 --> 37:27.600
Yeah.

37:27.600 --> 37:28.600
Verb conjugation is very strange.

37:28.600 --> 37:29.600
Yeah, yeah.

37:29.600 --> 37:30.600
So it could just be something like that.

37:30.600 --> 37:33.840
A lot of idioms that you, you know, you might not even be, even if you speak English, you

37:33.840 --> 37:35.480
might not be able to understand people.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.680
So that makes sense.

37:37.680 --> 37:42.120
I still say that if I'm an alien, I'm not signing off on the walk-in who doesn't know

37:42.120 --> 37:43.120
English.

37:43.120 --> 37:46.680
I would say that communicating is probably job number one for someone who's running for

37:46.680 --> 37:48.040
public office.

37:48.040 --> 37:54.560
I would say, sorry, you're a great walk-in, bad, bad speaker.

37:54.560 --> 37:55.920
You know, you do a lot of good stuff.

37:55.920 --> 37:57.240
We're going to keep you on here.

37:57.240 --> 37:58.800
You're going to go to class for another year.

37:58.800 --> 38:03.000
It's not that big a deal, man.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
I wonder when did he become a walk-in?

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Has he been?

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
No, no, no.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Biden.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.560
Has he been a walk-in this entire time or did he recently become a walk-in?

38:11.560 --> 38:12.560
No idea.

38:12.560 --> 38:13.560
No idea.

38:13.560 --> 38:14.560
All right.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.560
Let's see.

38:15.560 --> 38:21.240
I think maybe that might be good for us because his previous policies, not good.

38:21.240 --> 38:22.240
Not good.

38:22.240 --> 38:23.240
No.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.680
He's an alien who's going to be a more progressive politician.

38:25.680 --> 38:26.680
I like it.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.360
Well, I'm rooting for alien on this one.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.360
Well, all right.

38:29.360 --> 38:31.560
But his soul is probably still in there.

38:31.560 --> 38:32.560
Oh, shit.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.560
That's a problem.

38:33.560 --> 38:34.560
You've got to recognize that.

38:34.560 --> 38:35.560
Okay.

38:35.560 --> 38:40.120
There could still be Joe Biden, the soul, can still be in the body at the same time,

38:40.120 --> 38:45.680
but they're pushed to the side and they are not really able to communicate for a variety

38:45.680 --> 38:53.760
of reasons or they may actually be completely walled off and occupied elsewhere just trying

38:53.760 --> 38:57.040
to hang on to the body, but not really being there.

38:57.040 --> 39:04.720
And this can happen with a lot of illnesses with people, so it's not that unusual.

39:04.720 --> 39:10.040
But what is unusual and what the Illuminati dark magicians must be laughing their asses

39:10.040 --> 39:16.760
off about is the fact that the American people have actually voted for this guy.

39:16.760 --> 39:23.260
So I know that this is a sort of a slap in the face behind the scenes at the Trump administration

39:23.260 --> 39:31.520
who have plenty of magicians who are going to see through these ploys and know that that's

39:31.520 --> 39:32.520
what they're doing.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.520
It's a slap in the face.

39:34.520 --> 39:35.520
Trump's magician.

39:35.520 --> 39:36.520
Oh, God damn it.

39:36.520 --> 39:37.520
My magicians lost.

39:37.520 --> 39:41.360
His magician team is just so embarrassed that they lost to a walk-in.

39:41.360 --> 39:43.240
Oh, no, no, no.

39:43.240 --> 39:47.080
See, now I've got a whole new world that I would enjoy twice as much.

39:47.080 --> 39:53.640
Imagine if Rudy Giuliani was exactly as incompetent and moronic, but could also fail at using

39:53.640 --> 39:54.640
magic.

39:54.640 --> 39:55.640
That'd be great.

39:55.640 --> 39:56.640
Rudy Giuliani is a walk-in.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.440
Yeah, he's a walk-in who can use evil magic.

39:58.440 --> 39:59.440
I love it.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.440
I love it.

40:00.440 --> 40:04.880
Much like the idea of Robert David Steele being in the employee of the triad, a walk-in

40:04.880 --> 40:10.940
is a new term that I've not heard on other episodes of this.

40:10.940 --> 40:12.480
This is really expanding.

40:12.480 --> 40:16.000
Can you reach that soul using the power of love, Dan?

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
No.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.420
Oh, shit, they're really good.

40:18.420 --> 40:24.620
So recently, just after the election, we heard Steve Pachanik come on The War Room with Owen

40:24.620 --> 40:29.240
Troyer and talk about how the election was actually an elaborate setup.

40:29.240 --> 40:34.760
They used blockchain technology and barcodes in order to watermarks.

40:34.760 --> 40:38.400
And they immediately pretended that didn't happen.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.120
Yeah, they did not issue a retraction.

40:40.120 --> 40:42.920
Steve went way too QAnon.

40:42.920 --> 40:44.280
Turns out, carries into that.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.280
Of course.

40:45.280 --> 40:50.960
Obviously, a lot more votes went for Trump than went for Biden, in truth.

40:50.960 --> 40:57.700
But it's very difficult at this time, at least at the moment, to know exactly how many of

40:57.700 --> 41:02.360
those went for Trump.

41:02.360 --> 41:10.500
So I think perhaps the blockchain is revealing some of this.

41:10.500 --> 41:17.080
But I'm actually unsure, I'm curious how the blockchain was used.

41:17.080 --> 41:19.800
If it was used, it was used.

41:19.800 --> 41:23.080
And that's in, I guess, the sort of software.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.780
Yeah, I'm curious, too.

41:25.780 --> 41:29.440
But I also don't entertain any of these ideas because they're very stupid.

41:29.440 --> 41:31.720
It's really unfortunate to continue to hear.

41:31.720 --> 41:33.360
Well, obviously, this thing is true.

41:33.360 --> 41:37.960
I'm curious as to how or why they did it, but obviously, there's massive amounts of

41:37.960 --> 41:38.960
fraud.

41:38.960 --> 41:39.960
I don't know where or why or how.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.960
Yeah, it has been proven, but I don't understand it.

41:41.960 --> 41:45.280
I'm going to leave that aside because I just wanted to play that clip just to illustrate

41:45.280 --> 41:49.440
that like, oh, here's a connection with Steve Pachannik and all that bullshit nonsense.

41:49.440 --> 41:54.600
But I don't want to dwell on it because I'm too excited about this next clip.

41:54.600 --> 41:58.980
This next clip opens up all sorts of new vistas for us.

41:58.980 --> 42:06.200
I had a whistleblower that was revealing what is, in essence, the fight in the Pacific with

42:06.200 --> 42:21.000
our Navy and these Mer people back in, basically, associated with Mu underwater and the sailors.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.040
So I had a whistleblower in this regard.

42:24.040 --> 42:29.160
So I like that you were nodding aggressively through that, like, of course, of course.

42:29.160 --> 42:30.160
Totally.

42:30.160 --> 42:31.160
The sailors.

42:31.160 --> 42:32.160
The sailors.

42:32.160 --> 42:33.840
Who are associated with the kingdom of Mu.

42:33.840 --> 42:38.160
The sailors associated with the kingdom of Mu are fighting the Mer people.

42:38.160 --> 42:41.560
And then our Navy got mixed up in it at some point.

42:41.560 --> 42:42.560
Great.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.560
Love it.

42:43.560 --> 42:44.560
Oh, man.

42:44.560 --> 42:45.560
We're on this.

42:45.560 --> 42:48.560
We're going to need a few more details on this.

42:48.560 --> 42:54.120
Do our massive trillion dollar destroyers have issue with Mer people and tridents?

42:54.120 --> 42:55.280
They certainly did back then.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.280
Oh, well, that's fair.

42:56.280 --> 42:57.280
Yeah.

42:57.280 --> 42:58.800
Why did we invest so much money in it?

42:58.800 --> 42:59.800
Exactly.

42:59.800 --> 43:00.800
Why do you think the holes are so reinforced?

43:00.800 --> 43:01.800
Tridents.

43:01.800 --> 43:02.800
Too many tridents.

43:02.800 --> 43:03.800
Yeah.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.080
We've learned from the wooden holes.

43:05.080 --> 43:11.320
I just feel like these are issues where we need to settle fundamental precepts.

43:11.320 --> 43:15.980
We just need to, like, I'm not going to believe you when you tell me that there was a battle

43:15.980 --> 43:25.120
with Mu and the Mer people at our Navy until you prove to me that Mer people are real.

43:25.120 --> 43:29.200
I can't go the second step because I'm not granting you the first one.

43:29.200 --> 43:30.760
No, no, no.

43:30.760 --> 43:32.760
Mer people are taken as red, Dan.

43:32.760 --> 43:33.760
No.

43:33.760 --> 43:36.720
How many species continue to go undiscovered every day?

43:36.720 --> 43:37.720
Raptors.

43:37.720 --> 43:38.720
Millions.

43:38.720 --> 43:39.720
Mercantile dogs.

43:39.720 --> 43:40.720
Millions.

43:40.720 --> 43:41.720
All the time.

43:41.720 --> 43:43.920
You go deep enough in the ocean, Mer people.

43:43.920 --> 43:45.320
Big beetles in Vietnam.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.200
It gets too dark down there to see.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.160
Of course Mer people are down there.

43:49.160 --> 43:50.160
Sure.

43:50.160 --> 43:53.560
So, you know, Trump's a big problem for the Illuminati and all them.

43:53.560 --> 43:54.560
And not anymore.

43:54.560 --> 43:58.520
Well, you might have asked yourself, like, why didn't they just kill him?

43:58.520 --> 43:59.520
That is a good question.

43:59.520 --> 44:01.240
It turns out they've tried a bunch.

44:01.240 --> 44:06.280
But also, if they do kill him, it's mutually assured destruction, so they wouldn't do it.

44:06.280 --> 44:07.680
But they've also tried a whole bunch.

44:07.680 --> 44:08.680
Why would they try it?

44:08.680 --> 44:14.120
Okay, someone in the chat is saying he would have been killed, Trump would have been killed

44:14.120 --> 44:17.760
by February if he won again.

44:17.760 --> 44:21.400
Well, they've tried to kill him many times.

44:21.400 --> 44:22.400
How many?

44:22.400 --> 44:30.320
So it's important to realize that, again, it's kind of like a very interesting standoff.

44:30.320 --> 44:33.520
And it's a lot like, you know, The Godfather, right?

44:33.520 --> 44:39.080
So if you start killing people on one side, then the other side is going to start killing

44:39.080 --> 44:40.400
people on your side.

44:40.400 --> 44:42.620
And pretty soon there'll be nobody left.

44:42.620 --> 44:46.300
So it's called mutually assured destruction.

44:46.300 --> 44:51.600
And so this is not, and some people call it the nuclear option.

44:51.600 --> 44:56.200
This is not really an option for the game being played today.

44:56.200 --> 44:58.600
And it doesn't mean they won't try.

44:58.600 --> 45:01.200
It doesn't mean that it couldn't happen.

45:01.200 --> 45:04.520
I'm just saying that I know they've tried a number of times.

45:04.520 --> 45:08.440
I believe that Trump and team do have ET protection.

45:08.440 --> 45:09.440
Cool.

45:09.440 --> 45:12.840
But I do think that it should mean that they wouldn't try.

45:12.840 --> 45:15.080
I would assume that they wouldn't try, yes.

45:15.080 --> 45:19.760
If it's mutually assured destruction and it's not the way the game is being played or whatever,

45:19.760 --> 45:24.400
then it should not be a situation where they've tried and failed a bunch of times.

45:24.400 --> 45:28.120
Because they would know that if they succeeded, they would destroy themselves in the process.

45:28.120 --> 45:34.360
Sure, but I mean, you look at Cold War history and I could actually see people deciding like,

45:34.360 --> 45:35.360
eh, let's give it a shot.

45:35.360 --> 45:37.000
Well, here's my problem with that.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.920
The Soviet Union existed.

45:38.920 --> 45:40.020
That is a good point.

45:40.020 --> 45:41.720
That is a very good point.

45:41.720 --> 45:42.720
That is a good point.

45:42.720 --> 45:43.720
Yeah.

45:43.720 --> 45:44.720
It's tough to get around that.

45:44.720 --> 45:45.720
That's our problem.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.840
So, if he's got ET protection...

45:47.840 --> 45:48.840
Yes.

45:48.840 --> 45:50.240
Probably from Pleiadians, by the way.

45:50.240 --> 45:51.240
Sure.

45:51.240 --> 45:52.240
Probably.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.240
Because they're the good ones.

45:53.240 --> 45:54.240
Ostensibly.

45:54.240 --> 45:55.240
Well, hold on.

45:55.240 --> 45:56.240
Ostensibly.

45:56.240 --> 45:57.240
I don't know if you know this.

45:57.240 --> 45:58.240
There are actually...

45:58.240 --> 46:02.480
You know, almost every time we've ever heard Kerry talk about alien races, they're always

46:02.480 --> 46:03.720
uniform.

46:03.720 --> 46:07.760
They're always like, these ones are good, these ones are bad.

46:07.760 --> 46:12.920
I think it's because like they are all like resonating with something or there's some

46:12.920 --> 46:15.760
sort of like a, there's a magical element to it.

46:15.760 --> 46:19.120
It's like, you cannot be bad if you are a raptor or whatever.

46:19.120 --> 46:20.120
Yeah, yeah.

46:20.120 --> 46:23.880
There's some level of evolution maybe that is unspoken of or yeah.

46:23.880 --> 46:24.880
Perhaps.

46:24.880 --> 46:25.880
Yeah, yeah.

46:25.880 --> 46:26.880
It turns out that might not be the case.

46:26.880 --> 46:27.880
Okay.

46:27.880 --> 46:28.880
Because some Pleiadians are actually evil.

46:28.880 --> 46:29.880
Oh no.

46:29.880 --> 46:36.520
I believe that Trump and team do have ET protection of at least one race, and I'm pretty sure

46:36.520 --> 46:42.760
it's the Pleiadians, but it's a certain division of the Pleiadians because there are some dark

46:42.760 --> 46:45.340
groups in the Pleiadians.

46:45.340 --> 46:54.080
And that was proven by my interviews with Eddie, Eddie, okay, guy's name, now I'm drawing

46:54.080 --> 46:55.320
a blank on his last name.

46:55.320 --> 46:56.320
Page.

46:56.320 --> 46:57.320
Page.

46:57.320 --> 46:58.960
It would be Eddie Page.

46:58.960 --> 47:00.440
And I wouldn't say his name either.

47:00.440 --> 47:08.200
I love the idea that the words, that was proven by my interviews with Eddie Page.

47:08.200 --> 47:09.200
We can.

47:09.200 --> 47:10.780
That's a really good point.

47:10.780 --> 47:15.800
We can either decide from these interviews that Eddie Page is a raving crazy person and

47:15.800 --> 47:22.120
a racist who likes to think that he's an alien, or we can believe that some Pleiadians must

47:22.120 --> 47:24.240
be evil.

47:24.240 --> 47:27.280
Well, there is that.

47:27.280 --> 47:30.960
That's such an interesting decision-making tree.

47:30.960 --> 47:33.760
I can't not believe that he's a Pleiadian.

47:33.760 --> 47:36.600
So the fact that he's a Pleiadian must mean that there are evil Pleiadians.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.240
Ooh, that's a good point.

47:38.240 --> 47:40.560
Or you could just say, guy's talking shit.

47:40.560 --> 47:44.500
He was talking shit, but only because he was an evil Pleiadian.

47:44.500 --> 47:47.800
It doesn't have to be an either-or situation, Dan.

47:47.800 --> 47:50.360
I gotta say it's liberating to not believe any of this.

47:50.360 --> 47:51.360
Yeah, it is nice.

47:51.360 --> 47:52.360
It is nice.

47:52.360 --> 47:56.640
I feel less trapped in making up my own bullshit on a daily and constant basis.

47:56.640 --> 47:59.200
Yeah, it's very simple to explain what's going on here.

47:59.200 --> 48:01.440
Bunch of people talking shit.

48:01.440 --> 48:03.440
Don't need to go further than that.

48:03.440 --> 48:04.440
The end.

48:04.440 --> 48:07.440
But Carrie can speak freely and talk all the shit she wants.

48:07.440 --> 48:08.440
Why is that?

48:08.440 --> 48:09.440
Because she doesn't work for CNN.

48:09.440 --> 48:10.640
Oh, that's a good call.

48:10.640 --> 48:17.420
One of the reasons I can speak so freely here is that I'm considered super fringe.

48:17.420 --> 48:24.800
If I was mainstream, they probably would have fired me or killed me a long time ago.

48:24.800 --> 48:30.760
So it's when we're out on the fringe that we're allowed to get away with talking like

48:30.760 --> 48:31.760
this.

48:31.760 --> 48:39.560
Although I am under attack and sometimes it's very obvious, like having two strikes on my

48:39.560 --> 48:40.560
YouTube channel.

48:40.560 --> 48:45.200
I wouldn't call that an attack, but yeah, I think that she does make a good point.

48:45.200 --> 48:53.440
She can't speak freely because no one is her boss and no one can stop her from doing it.

48:53.440 --> 48:57.320
If you had an employer, you would have been fired long ago because the work is bad.

48:57.320 --> 48:59.680
It would be just bad.

48:59.680 --> 49:00.680
Because you don't do good.

49:00.680 --> 49:01.680
Yeah.

49:01.680 --> 49:04.080
And to be fair, we would have been fired long ago too.

49:04.080 --> 49:10.280
Not necessarily because terrible work, but because why would anyone pay us to do this?

49:10.280 --> 49:12.160
It's ridiculous.

49:12.160 --> 49:18.560
There is a freedom that comes with not being attached to some kind of a big entity or something.

49:18.560 --> 49:26.760
It doesn't mean that there's anything inherently like integrity bearing about it.

49:26.760 --> 49:31.320
It's just, you wouldn't have gotten killed if you worked for CNN, you would have been

49:31.320 --> 49:32.320
fired.

49:32.320 --> 49:33.320
Yeah.

49:33.320 --> 49:34.320
You're talking about fucking merpeople battles.

49:34.320 --> 49:36.520
Merpeople would be an interesting thing to hear on CNN.

49:36.520 --> 49:42.600
Wolf Blitzer comes in, our Navy took out three merpeople and broke a treaty.

49:42.600 --> 49:45.160
Oh, God damn it.

49:45.160 --> 49:47.240
The mer-treaty's broken.

49:47.240 --> 49:53.600
I like her version of the, because we always live in the, the enemy is both ultra powered

49:53.600 --> 49:59.480
and incredibly impossible to, it can't win and you know, super weak simultaneously.

49:59.480 --> 50:04.040
Hers feels more like a game though, because she's like, I'm allowed to do all this stuff

50:04.040 --> 50:05.760
because I'm on the fringe.

50:05.760 --> 50:07.940
They're still attacking me though.

50:07.940 --> 50:17.120
So it's like, why would you do an attack unless you kind of mean it to fail over and

50:17.120 --> 50:18.360
over and over again?

50:18.360 --> 50:23.320
You want to inconvenience the people like her who are truth tellers, but you don't want

50:23.320 --> 50:25.480
to make martyrs of them.

50:25.480 --> 50:32.560
I'm combining her and Alex's beliefs about this, the way they rationalize like, Hey,

50:32.560 --> 50:37.120
I've existed for a long time and no one seems to care.

50:37.120 --> 50:41.960
That kind of like, yeah, if you went too hard against me, it would prove me right.

50:41.960 --> 50:42.960
Or that kind of.

50:42.960 --> 50:43.960
Right.

50:43.960 --> 50:47.400
If you were to go against me at all, I would be too powerful.

50:47.400 --> 50:49.200
I would succeed in the fringes.

50:49.200 --> 50:50.200
All right.

50:50.200 --> 50:51.680
So it's sabotage.

50:51.680 --> 50:53.680
That's what they're more interested in.

50:53.680 --> 50:56.100
I can see you have figured it out, Dan.

50:56.100 --> 51:01.080
So she, you know, she carries on the same page as Steve in terms of the like watermarks

51:01.080 --> 51:03.280
on balance, the blockchain, the whole thing.

51:03.280 --> 51:09.400
And she seems to be on another sort of similar tip and that is really thinking Melania is

51:09.400 --> 51:11.400
really important.

51:11.400 --> 51:15.160
Thoughts about Melania and their son?

51:15.160 --> 51:19.800
Well, I think Melania is OK.

51:19.800 --> 51:24.400
Let me just say that Captain Mark Richards has said he believes Melania is in touch with

51:24.400 --> 51:32.960
an E.T. race and that she is a conduit conduit for Trump to get the downloads and information

51:32.960 --> 51:35.400
from that race.

51:35.400 --> 51:37.280
And I think that's very possible.

51:37.280 --> 51:38.280
Yeah.

51:38.280 --> 51:44.200
And I guess it's Mark Richards also thinks that she's not fully human.

51:44.200 --> 51:46.400
And that's that's also very possible.

51:46.400 --> 51:53.400
I think that this is an interesting way that people like Kerry are trying to rationalize

51:53.400 --> 51:56.320
the sense that Melania doesn't seem to be doing anything.

51:56.320 --> 51:58.480
Or interested at all in this whatsoever.

51:58.480 --> 51:59.480
Yeah.

51:59.480 --> 52:00.480
Yeah.

52:00.480 --> 52:04.440
And I think that like, you know, trying to have this like, all right, Trump is a superhuman

52:04.440 --> 52:10.400
battling against the forces of darkness and all the demonic child abusers who live under

52:10.400 --> 52:12.360
the Getty Museum or whatever the fuck.

52:12.360 --> 52:13.360
Indeed.

52:13.360 --> 52:16.640
You know, like you have this heroic figure and then his wife is somebody who just seems

52:16.640 --> 52:18.480
to not give a shit about anything.

52:18.480 --> 52:19.480
Yeah.

52:19.480 --> 52:22.560
And in order to make that make sense, you have to create this elaborate backstory, which

52:22.560 --> 52:25.920
I guess she doesn't talk that much in public and doesn't get involved in too much because

52:25.920 --> 52:30.280
she's too busy being a conduit for the aliens to help Trump with his secret protection.

52:30.280 --> 52:31.280
Sure.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.280
Sure.

52:32.280 --> 52:34.560
And the aliens get like upgrade.

52:34.560 --> 52:35.820
Okay.

52:35.820 --> 52:39.000
The aliens upgrade Trump with a new wife.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.280
And that's why he's had so many.

52:40.280 --> 52:41.280
Yeah.

52:41.280 --> 52:44.080
I mean, I guess that's one way you could get around.

52:44.080 --> 52:45.080
One way you do it.

52:45.080 --> 52:46.080
Yeah.

52:46.080 --> 52:49.080
So Trump, you know, with the help of his conduit wife.

52:49.080 --> 52:50.080
Sure.

52:50.080 --> 52:51.080
He's true.

52:51.080 --> 52:55.080
What he's doing is I can't stress this enough.

52:55.080 --> 52:57.520
There's big Adronachrome out there.

52:57.520 --> 52:58.520
Okay.

52:58.520 --> 53:01.600
You know how there's big pharma, big oil.

53:01.600 --> 53:08.080
There's also a big Adronachrome manufacturing industry publicly traded on the black market.

53:08.080 --> 53:09.080
Oh, okay.

53:09.080 --> 53:10.080
Secret market.

53:10.080 --> 53:11.080
Okay, good.

53:11.080 --> 53:12.080
Yes.

53:12.080 --> 53:13.080
Shadow market.

53:13.080 --> 53:14.080
Shadow market.

53:14.080 --> 53:15.080
And Trump is trying to dismantle that.

53:15.080 --> 53:16.120
And this is so crucial.

53:16.120 --> 53:22.200
And that's the same thing with Adronachrome and that whole manufacturing production line

53:22.200 --> 53:29.840
that involves, you know, taking a baby, you know, from their parents or whatever, or even

53:29.840 --> 53:37.080
in vitro creating test tube babies as product, and then getting a Adronachrome out at the

53:37.080 --> 53:38.480
other end.

53:38.480 --> 53:42.000
This is a very diabolical process.

53:42.000 --> 53:46.040
There's nothing they have control over in those regards.

53:46.040 --> 53:52.920
Now they may be attempting to get control and that has to involve a battle and you can't

53:52.920 --> 53:54.980
ask nicely.

53:54.980 --> 53:57.160
So that means a war.

53:57.160 --> 54:02.800
That means the one with the biggest gun wins, you know, the best technology, however you

54:02.800 --> 54:04.900
want to ride it, and so on.

54:04.900 --> 54:08.840
So this is what we're dealing with and what he's dealing with.

54:08.840 --> 54:10.160
That's what Trump's dealing with.

54:10.160 --> 54:15.680
He's dealing with a manufacturing industry of trying to make test tube babies to scare

54:15.680 --> 54:17.560
and then drink their blood.

54:17.560 --> 54:22.080
I got to be honest, all too often, I don't really think about what he has to deal with.

54:22.080 --> 54:23.080
Right.

54:23.080 --> 54:24.080
You got to empathize a little bit more.

54:24.080 --> 54:25.080
You really do.

54:25.080 --> 54:26.080
Because if he's got to deal with this.

54:26.080 --> 54:27.760
I have a quick question though.

54:27.760 --> 54:28.760
Sure.

54:28.760 --> 54:29.760
Alright.

54:29.760 --> 54:32.640
Um, so we can clone people, right?

54:32.640 --> 54:33.640
Yeah.

54:33.640 --> 54:34.640
Okay.

54:34.640 --> 54:39.720
So that means we can basically manufacture bodies, right?

54:39.720 --> 54:40.720
Mm hmm.

54:40.720 --> 54:44.680
Wouldn't that suggest we could also manufacture just the blood?

54:44.680 --> 54:45.680
Yep.

54:45.680 --> 54:47.200
And we can also synthesize Adronachrome.

54:47.200 --> 54:48.200
Yeah.

54:48.200 --> 54:49.400
So I don't understand.

54:49.400 --> 54:54.240
So I guess it has to be some like dark ritual thing that they're talking about to gain the

54:54.240 --> 54:56.460
intergalactic strength, I guess.

54:56.460 --> 54:59.720
But in this cosmology, it seems like you could just really easily manufacture.

54:59.720 --> 55:04.020
It's like in the underworld movies, if we're going to only ever talk about movies whenever

55:04.020 --> 55:07.960
we're talking about Carrie Cassidy, you can make your own fucking blood and you move on.

55:07.960 --> 55:09.360
Everybody gets a good job.

55:09.360 --> 55:10.360
Yeah.

55:10.360 --> 55:11.360
Yeah.

55:11.360 --> 55:15.180
I think that, I think that, you know, it's interesting that they don't ever go down that

55:15.180 --> 55:17.600
road of thought.

55:17.600 --> 55:23.000
And it's to their detriment because it's a big gaping hole in their theory.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.440
But what I think is interesting about the way that Carrie is expressing this and presenting

55:27.440 --> 55:31.600
it is like, this is not going to end without a war, right?

55:31.600 --> 55:40.420
So if a war doesn't happen internally, then that is evidence that this Adronachrome manufacturing

55:40.420 --> 55:43.020
industry is still up and running.

55:43.020 --> 55:49.540
There must be a giant conflagration or else there is no change in the status quo.

55:49.540 --> 55:50.540
That's fucked up.

55:50.540 --> 55:54.680
Why have we got Congress to regulate the industry?

55:54.680 --> 55:55.680
What?

55:55.680 --> 56:03.260
Why isn't Carrie, look, if she's interested in electoral politics now, why isn't she campaigning

56:03.260 --> 56:08.960
for enough senators and congresspersons to write a law regulating the use of Adronachrome?

56:08.960 --> 56:11.120
You broke my brain.

56:11.120 --> 56:16.160
I don't know why she's not trying to go the civic route.

56:16.160 --> 56:21.240
I'm just saying if we got a participatory republic, I think she should start there instead

56:21.240 --> 56:22.240
of the secret war.

56:22.240 --> 56:23.240
Fair enough.

56:23.240 --> 56:24.240
Fair enough.

56:24.240 --> 56:26.440
That might be a good first step.

56:26.440 --> 56:30.520
So at this point, Carrie's kind of running out of energy and like kind of, you know,

56:30.520 --> 56:34.600
petering out a little, but she takes a couple of questions from the chat.

56:34.600 --> 56:38.960
I don't think that she actually reads the questions themselves, but responds to them.

56:38.960 --> 56:40.640
This first one is about the queen.

56:40.640 --> 56:41.640
Okay.

56:41.640 --> 56:49.200
So we'll find out if there's anything else people might want to ask.

56:49.200 --> 56:52.720
Okay.

56:52.720 --> 56:59.080
So somebody thinks that the queen was beheaded and we don't have the regular, I'm sure they

56:59.080 --> 57:00.960
think she's a clone or whatever.

57:00.960 --> 57:01.960
Yeah.

57:01.960 --> 57:02.960
How stupid is that?

57:02.960 --> 57:05.160
A lot of this is conjecture in my opinion.

57:05.160 --> 57:10.000
I mean, these people put out this stuff, but that doesn't mean they know.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.720
Everyone knows the queen's a walk-in.

57:11.720 --> 57:12.720
Oh man.

57:12.720 --> 57:15.640
A lot of these dumb-dumbs think that the queen is a clone.

57:15.640 --> 57:16.640
That's not true.

57:16.640 --> 57:18.640
Joe Biden's a clone.

57:18.640 --> 57:20.520
Duh, idiots.

57:20.520 --> 57:26.320
So strange to try and figure out like what's the difference between conjecture A and conjecture

57:26.320 --> 57:29.120
B. Completely different.

57:29.120 --> 57:32.260
It was proven in the interviews with Eddie Page, Dan.

57:32.260 --> 57:33.260
Some Pleiadians are evil.

57:33.260 --> 57:34.260
Some Pleiadians are evil.

57:34.260 --> 57:35.260
Yeah.

57:35.260 --> 57:36.260
That's all you need to know.

57:36.260 --> 57:40.400
In this clip, she fields a call about whether or not Trump is Anunnaki.

57:40.400 --> 57:41.880
Ooh, that's a good question.

57:41.880 --> 57:42.880
He's not.

57:42.880 --> 57:43.880
Okay.

57:43.880 --> 57:44.880
Is Trump Anunnaki?

57:44.880 --> 57:46.560
No, I think Trump-

57:46.560 --> 57:48.680
He's an Anunnaki.

57:48.680 --> 57:50.720
Is not Anunnaki.

57:50.720 --> 57:54.880
Trump is a reincarnation of General Patton.

57:54.880 --> 58:00.880
He is a villain of a civil mission and he is a person.

58:00.880 --> 58:01.880
Pleiadian.

58:01.880 --> 58:02.880
Yep.

58:02.880 --> 58:03.880
Uh-huh.

58:03.880 --> 58:04.880
Yep.

58:04.880 --> 58:06.760
Yeah, a hero of General Patton.

58:06.760 --> 58:12.160
General Patton, The General Patton that we are speaking of.

58:12.160 --> 58:13.160
Yes.

58:13.160 --> 58:14.160
Okay.

58:14.160 --> 58:15.160
Yep.

58:15.160 --> 58:16.160
When did he die?

58:16.160 --> 58:17.160
Actually, I did look this up.

58:17.160 --> 58:18.160
Uh-huh.

58:18.160 --> 58:19.160
He died just before Trump was born.

58:19.160 --> 58:20.160
Really?

58:20.160 --> 58:21.160
Ooh, maybe he is?

58:21.160 --> 58:22.160
I think that's-

58:22.160 --> 58:23.160
I assume that's why they say it.

58:23.160 --> 58:24.160
Yeah.

58:24.160 --> 58:25.160
Yeah, yeah.

58:25.160 --> 58:26.160
They looked it up, otherwise they would feel real stupid.

58:26.160 --> 58:27.160
Yes.

58:27.160 --> 58:28.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:28.160 --> 58:29.160
Yeah.

58:29.160 --> 58:31.680
Yeah, it is- it's pretty close to like I think it's maybe like six, eight months off or something

58:31.680 --> 58:32.680
like that.

58:32.680 --> 58:33.680
Six, eight months off?

58:33.680 --> 58:34.680
What is he- what's Trump doing?

58:34.680 --> 58:36.080
six to eight months spiritually.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.040
Got a lounge.

58:37.040 --> 58:37.880
Got a lounge?

58:37.880 --> 58:38.720
Take a load off.

58:38.720 --> 58:39.540
Oh, that's fair.

58:39.540 --> 58:40.380
Patton's life is tough.

58:40.380 --> 58:41.220
Patton, it's exhausting.

58:41.220 --> 58:42.040
Yeah, you know, you're right.

58:42.040 --> 58:44.740
And then you gotta prepare for being a horrifying monster.

58:44.740 --> 58:45.580
Yeah.

58:45.580 --> 58:46.880
I gotcha.

58:46.880 --> 58:51.880
At this point, Carrie discusses Israel and her feelings.

58:51.980 --> 58:53.460
Oh, stop.

58:53.460 --> 58:54.300
And...

58:54.300 --> 58:55.120
She should not.

58:55.120 --> 58:57.660
I'm gonna say I don't respect her enough

58:57.660 --> 59:02.660
to even joke about how terrible and stupid her ideas

59:02.660 --> 59:05.240
about Israel are, so we're just gonna skip past that.

59:05.240 --> 59:06.080
Okay, good.

59:06.080 --> 59:06.900
Good call.

59:06.900 --> 59:08.640
And get into more interesting territory,

59:08.640 --> 59:13.640
and that is Alex Jones believes that there is a virus.

59:14.260 --> 59:15.100
COVID.

59:15.100 --> 59:15.940
Yes.

59:15.940 --> 59:18.520
COVID-19 is real, but it's also a hoax.

59:18.520 --> 59:19.760
Even though he has David Icke on,

59:19.760 --> 59:21.160
who says that it's not real at all.

59:21.160 --> 59:22.000
Right.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.680
That's another version of this.

59:23.680 --> 59:26.200
David Icke believes there is no virus.

59:26.200 --> 59:27.040
Correct.

59:27.040 --> 59:29.900
But also seems to believe in medical science

59:29.900 --> 59:31.600
to an extent. Somewhat, I guess.

59:31.600 --> 59:33.800
Carrie doesn't believe viruses exist.

59:33.800 --> 59:34.640
Okay.

59:34.640 --> 59:36.520
My understanding of viruses,

59:37.920 --> 59:42.600
and I credit Dr. Robert Young for teaching me about this,

59:42.600 --> 59:46.580
is that actually they've never isolated a real virus.

59:46.580 --> 59:51.000
That viruses are not what you think they are,

59:51.000 --> 59:55.440
and that they're simply poisons expelled by our cells

59:55.440 --> 59:59.280
when we're faced with poisons in the outer

59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.000
and inner environment through food we eat

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.280
or somebody shooting us up with, say, a bioweapon.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.440
Sure.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.120
I think she might be right.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.760
A lot of the times I worry that my humors and Icke's

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.360
are out of balance with each other, and that can happen,

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.440
and then you'll just start influencing.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.560
A lot of people thought stuff like that,

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.840
about like humors and what have you,

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:24.000
and then at a certain point,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.600
people thought about like germs.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.640
Sure, yeah.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.080
But they were wrong.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.240
The viruses are part of what's called germ theory,

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:36.080
and germ theory is very old-fashioned,

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.120
going back to the past year,

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:43.120
and then that information was actually, as usual, wrong.

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:48.280
And I've done several interviews with Dr. Robert Young

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:51.080
about all of this, so you can go on my website,

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.040
search under his last name, and find those interviews,

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.800
and I highly recommend them.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.160
If you want to find out about the history

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:02.000
and why germ theory is no longer believed

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.960
by the most intelligent, advanced doctors out there.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.320
So that's important to know.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.480
You gotta do a little better than Robert Young

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.240
as your reference for-

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.080
Number one.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.200
No, we talked about him

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.080
on another Project Camelot episode.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.280
He is the guy who like went to jail.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:25.960
He talked someone into not getting treatment for cancer,

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.320
and getting his holistic approach,

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:33.960
and then they got stage four incurable progression,

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.000
and he got sued for millions of dollars because of that,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.720
like malpractice, and didn't have a license for a period.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:44.960
Anyway, if he is the most advanced, hippest, coolest doctor

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:47.400
who's telling you all about how germ theory is wrong,

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.500
I would say branch out, talk to a few more doctors,

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.040
because this is silly.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.440
I like her calling germs there.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.240
Oh, it's very old-fashioned, the germ theory.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:01.560
Compared to obviously things create are inside yourselves,

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.560
and then they explode out whenever it's poisoned.

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.160
That's brand new research, Dan.

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.720
Nobody has ever thought- That's hip.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.740
That maybe spontaneous generation of poisons

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:12.160
could explode through your body.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.000
Yeah.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:13.880
Ah, that's a new one.

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.840
So look, dude, the germs and germ theory,

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:20.120
it's all a plot by the aliens.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.840
Maybe, who knows? Sure, eh, why not?

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.960
And you know, so you think that germs and viruses,

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.160
that you think everything's contagious, but it's not.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.000
Oh.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:29.840
But you know what are?

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.660
Bad viewings?

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.880
Memes. Oh.

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:34.640
What is contagious, however,

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:38.720
and can be taken in through osmosis, what's called osmosis,

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.760
and in essence, through memes,

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:46.120
is the mental infection that you get

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.480
because you are, you become,

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.760
you might mind control, basically.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:52.600
Of course.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.960
You are persuaded, influenced mentally

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.680
to take something on.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.520
So that means that when you are in a household

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.360
and someone catches a cold,

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:06.720
you can easily catch it through what's called empathy.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.560
Okay?

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:12.360
And so this is, it's all in the way you think about things.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.840
And that is, that's first and foremost,

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.680
how we affect our bodies, is how you think.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:21.500
Now, interestingly, this would be really easy,

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.580
or I mean, there would be a way to scientifically

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.120
try and get to the bottom of this.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.520
You would have to construct something

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:30.120
where knowing that someone you care about deeply is sick

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.320
causes you to get sick.

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.160
Exactly.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.800
And I don't think that studies have borne that out.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.340
Nah, I'm pretty sure it's true.

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:38.400
Because if you're saying, oh yeah, yeah, yeah,

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.920
when you're in a house with someone

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.320
who has a contagious illness,

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.480
you get it because it's empathy.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.320
Right.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.500
That would be indistinguishable

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.040
from getting it because of germs or contagious illness.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.800
So her theory would be tested very easily

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.520
if say you were long distance away from somebody.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.360
Exactly.

01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:57.200
That's what I'm saying.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.020
Who cared very deeply about it.

01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:00.480
And I don't know of any transmission of diseases

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.740
long distance.

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.080
There's no morphic transmission of diseases?

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.880
If Kerry can establish this

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.940
and point me to some literature on it, I'd be interested.

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:13.200
But I've got a doctor with your name on him.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.040
Robert Young?

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:14.880
Oh yeah.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.440
I don't, I'm not gonna listen to him.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.280
Oh boy.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.000
Anyway, Kerry's got one last thing to say here.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.360
She's talking to a lot of people all around the world

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.240
and they're all interested in this election.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.080
Of course.

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.280
And I'm talking to people all over the world,

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.160
you know, and in contact with them

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:31.640
since I travel so much in the past,

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.400
haven't been able to do much traveling lately.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.040
And I can say that they are also very long.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:38.880
Too much empathy?

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.160
Because they realize that in a certain sense,

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:45.940
this is all about who is gonna run planet earth,

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.760
at least on the human side.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:48.600
Of course.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.360
And so that's what this election really comes down to.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.360
So, okay.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:59.360
I think I am sort of done for now.

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.480
Yeah, me too.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.320
I don't know.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.400
I think that it's such a gross perspective

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.140
to be like, whoever wins this election

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:06.840
is who's gonna run the planet.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.660
Yeah.

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:08.960
Just because, I mean, first of all,

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.880
it's so America centric.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.720
Oh yeah.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.820
It's so disrespectful to the other countries of the world.

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:14.660
Yep.

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.480
But second, like, I don't think,

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:20.240
like, of course I want everything to turn out

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.480
that Biden becomes president.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.080
I don't want him running the world.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:24.920
No.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.880
But it's very strange that these people,

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.480
people like Kerry, people like Alex,

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.880
they do want Trump running the world.

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.300
Yes, 100%.

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:36.760
And the fear, like, it's just so weird.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.320
Like, why would you want that even if you like this guy?

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.160
I don't know.

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.120
I liked Obama as president.

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.380
You know, obviously had some problems

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.000
in a lot of policies and decisions.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:46.840
Sure.

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:48.800
But even as much as I supported him

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.160
as the president of the United States,

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.800
I never would want him to be the head of the world.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.640
No, absolutely not.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:54.640
Head of humans.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.720
No, no.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.240
It's very silly.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.300
It's childish.

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:01.880
Yeah, I don't get how they can jive

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:05.520
those two things together without just openly saying,

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:10.520
like, I want the end of all participatory government.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:11.520
Period.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.760
Well, I mean, if you have-

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.640
Like, that's your-

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.040
You can't vote for aliens.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.560
So, like, if you believe that that's the real world

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.640
that's going on behind the scenes,

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.560
what does it really matter if you give up

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.360
the pretense of democracy?

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.200
Yeah, exactly.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.480
You know, like, sure.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.680
Yeah, you can feel good about casting a vote,

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.640
but that person's working for a lizard.

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.480
Right.

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:32.300
You understand?

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.140
So it doesn't matter.

01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:35.400
And I think the thing that really,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.480
like, the thing that's interesting to me

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:41.280
about how they always go about this is that

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.120
at no point in time is it like,

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.460
let's get enough people together,

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:47.080
because they know that they can't actually

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.280
get people to do anything.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.120
I mean, we saw the caravan.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.020
We saw the caravan.

01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:52.440
They're not gonna be like, let's get a movement together.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.000
They're just like, it all has to be in secret,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.440
because if I tried to get a bunch of people to know it,

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.720
they'd realize that I'm an idiot, you know?

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.800
There's that option, or the other option is,

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.600
let's wait until someone else builds something

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.440
and then co-opt it like a tea party.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.320
Yeah, exactly, yeah.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.160
Yep.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.840
But look, I just think, like, you know,

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.640
I start to feel like Trump's been really bad

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.480
for these people.

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:15.320
Oh yeah.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.320
It's like, this is sad.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.600
Like, if you're somebody who's like,

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:24.000
I'm all about the ins and outs of secret programs,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.420
and I'm all about the, like,

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:28.680
these aliens that have been visiting us forever,

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:30.880
and my friend who's definitely not a murderer

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.360
talks to raptors in prison,

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.160
and he tells me all about these great space adventures

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.960
and sentient spaceships,

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.320
you should not give a shit about a president.

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.160
Nope.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.960
It's degrading for you two.

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.320
Okay, so.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.240
Because Trump isn't fucking revealing

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.680
anything about the space.

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:47.520
Nope.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.200
He's not gonna prove you right.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.040
Nope.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.400
You know that.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.260
I think one of the hugest things

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:55.320
that's been an issue for them,

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.500
with Trump being president,

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.520
and this is,

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.600
cause we've heard this joke so many times,

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:02.040
or at least I have this,

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.200
the joke so many times, like,

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.480
when Obama was president,

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.640
I didn't have to care about politics,

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:08.560
that's why I liked him,

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:10.960
cause I could walk, do my day,

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.880
and think that there's a reasonable person

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.600
who's trying, you know?

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.640
That kind of thing.

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:19.320
With Trump, everyone has been paying attention

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:21.320
all the time.

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:23.000
So all of that secret stuff,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.900
all this stuff that's going on behind the scenes,

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.360
has to be so secret now,

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.800
that it's just either you believe it

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.840
to the point where you've completely lost

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.320
any sense of reality,

01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:34.760
or you just have to go like,

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.440
no, this is too stupid,

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:37.520
this is just too dumb.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.240
And that's where QAnon gets a foothold.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.880
Exactly, yeah.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:43.160
I just think that,

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.920
you know, when the history books are written,

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.920
no one will write about Project Camelot,

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.440
but if they do,

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.080
it's just,

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.320
it's just, you should,

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.480
everyone who made a decision

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.280
to sign up with this is like,

01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:59.360
they made a bad move.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.360
Strategically, they made a bad move for their grifts.

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.120
It seemed like it was gonna be really good

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:04.960
in the short term,

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.860
but it's just not gonna pay off.

01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:08.080
There's going to be too much

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.840
that you're gonna have to answer for later

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:10.720
and explain away,

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.720
like, how are you gonna explain Melania

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.440
being a space conduit in five years?

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:18.320
Like, why isn't she still a space conduit?

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.800
Ah, they let her go.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.800
Okay, sure, whatever.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.200
They replaced her with a new space,

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.020
I don't know.

01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:26.580
Okay, and then in a year,

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:28.800
like Biden, is he still a walk-in?

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:29.800
Yeah, that's a good question.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.200
Like, what's going on?

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.660
Well, I think that's probably why it's so,

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:35.460
they're all so very desperate

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.720
for Trump to remain in office forever.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.920
Because as long as he's in office forever,

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.480
you can make up all kinds of bullshit.

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:43.560
But after a while,

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.080
everybody starts looking at reality again,

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.040
like, oh man, shit, that's crazy.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.640
Why did people believe that he was going to,

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:54.140
how many, Hunter Biden is just gone now.

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.920
We just don't even talk about that shit.

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.380
I'm sure some people still are.

01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:58.220
Maybe.

01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.680
I bet Kerry put out a video about him last week.

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:00.560
That's probably true.

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.440
That's probably true.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.800
Which again, I don't know

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.160
what the alien angle on that is.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.600
That's a good question.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.440
But yeah, it's interesting.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.480
I feel like there was a part of me

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.280
that while I was listening to this episode,

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:16.160
I was like, what does this have to do with space?

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.280
And then it did come in,

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.720
and I was like, oh, that's what it has to do with space.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.120
And some of it's pretty funny,

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.920
like the idea of merpeople battles.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.920
Love merpeople battles.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.960
I was learning about walk-ins

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:30.120
and how Robert David Steele's working for the triads.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.320
But yeah, it's kind of,

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.400
I feel like she's in a rut too.

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.660
Yeah.

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:35.900
How?

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:36.740
It's tough.

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:40.400
I can't believe that they're this committed

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.620
to not admitting that they got conned.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.800
Well, it's tough because, you know,

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.240
I mean, like the two people that we talk about,

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:52.200
maybe the most, Kerry and Alex, are both psychics.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.520
Yeah.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:54.360
Yeah, that's true.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:56.280
So they can't get conned.

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.860
They have built themselves up so much

01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:02.800
that to admit even the slightest bit of I got hoodwinked

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.360
is a real hit to their brand.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.400
Yeah, they're both psychics,

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:06.720
which would be invalidated

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.920
if they were on the wrong path for four years

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:09.760
in the same way, you know.

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.440
But AJ apologized to Hamdi Ulukaya

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.720
and everybody just moved on.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.000
But he tried to pretend that he didn't.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:15.840
Yeah, that's true.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.680
Yeah.

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.500
Oh boy.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:18.340
I don't know.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.280
Anyway, this has been a nice little trip down a wackier road.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.480
This has been a lovely wacky Monday.

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:22.680
Yeah.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.640
Hopefully Alex will be back in studio

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:25.540
beginning of this week,

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:29.080
and we can check back in on the hashtag 79 days of hell.

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.440
See how that's going.

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:31.880
I'm sure it's going great.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:32.960
But until then, we have a website.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:33.800
We do have a website.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:34.640
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:35.640
Yeah, we're also on Twitter.

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:36.480
We are on Twitter.

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.360
It's at knowledge underscore fight

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.760
and at go to bed Jordan.

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:39.680
Yeah, we're also on Facebook.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.240
We are on Facebook, it's outside.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.800
If you could please find a local charity

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.760
or bail fund in your area

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.940
to help out people doing God's work right now.

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:47.780
We'll be back.

01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:50.720
But until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX Clark.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:51.880
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:54.320
I am the truant time traveler.

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.280
Andy in Kansas.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.120
You're on the air.

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:56.940
Thanks for holding.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.240
Hello, Alex.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.080
I'm a first time caller.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:00.900
I'm a huge fan.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.740
I love your work.

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:02.580
Love you.
