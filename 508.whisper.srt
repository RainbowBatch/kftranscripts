2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Knowledgefight.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I need, I need money.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Stop it.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's time to pray.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Thanks for holding.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hello Alex, I'm a first-time caller.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm a huge fan.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I love your work.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Knowledgefight.

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
N-N-N-N-N-Knowledgefight.com.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I love you.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm Dan.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm Jordan.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We're couple dudes that like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
bit about Alex Jones.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, indeed we are Dan.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Jordan.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Dan!

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Jordan.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I have a quick question for you.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What's up?

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What's your bright spot today?

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
My bright spot might be a little bit disappointing, but it's again Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I've been taking my time playing it casually.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
One of the things that I found really interesting about the game is without giving any spoilers

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
or anything, I find myself playing this game and having more moral choices than I have

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
in a lot of other games in the past.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's fair.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And part of it is there are choices that you can make that I'm almost certain will not

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
affect the game at all.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Sure, sure.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But I feel bad about it.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They affect you.

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes, absolutely.

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't know if it's just that I have not been exposed to games that do that well in

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,160
the past, but I feel a lot more like these little things that you run into when you're

51
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
exploring around the world.

52
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Sure, totally.

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,200
It's a little thing like you can rip somebody off if you want to and no one will ever know,

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
but you'll know.

55
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
You will know.

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Yeah.

57
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Absolutely.

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
I enjoy that.

59
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,320
It's one of those situations in the game where I realized like later on I had just finished

60
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,560
a quest and later on I was playing another one and I was like, I feel bad about what

61
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,120
I did to that guy.

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,400
I think it was the right thing to do, but you know what, it doesn't make me feel good.

63
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,080
You failed the test, bro.

64
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
So I enjoy that.

65
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,200
It makes the gameplay a little more fun.

66
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:47,400
And especially because I want to give a bright spot to Age of Calamity, the Hyrule Warriors,

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
but I just can't.

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
You just can't.

69
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Disappointed?

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,640
I started dabbling in it a little bit because, you know, I can't not.

71
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Sure.

72
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,960
Apparently I'm a gamer bro now.

73
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
That's what happened.

74
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
That's what happened.

75
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
It happened so quick.

76
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,280
You can't go outside and all of a sudden we're gamer gators.

77
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Yeah.

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
It took two seconds.

79
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
I didn't say gamer gators.

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
No, I'm pretty sure that's what you said.

81
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
I said I'm a gamer bro.

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
I know.

83
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
I'm just kidding.

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,760
I guess my feeling on it is it's fun.

85
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,040
The Age of Calamity is fun and if anybody enjoys it, I don't think you're wrong too.

86
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,600
I just kind of had expectations of more of a Dynasty Warriors-esque game and that itch

87
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
wasn't scratched.

88
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Oh, that's unfortunate.

89
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Or it hasn't been.

90
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,120
But it's still fun for what it is.

91
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
So I can't give it a bright spot.

92
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,560
Gotta keep it on the moral choices.

93
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,440
Stay the course with Valhalla.

94
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,220
How about you?

95
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,220
Maybe adjacent.

96
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,240
Dan, I went to a board game store.

97
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240
Oh yeah.

98
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
Uh huh.

99
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
It was very exciting.

100
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,880
We had played together a board game called Mysterium, which I found very enjoyable.

101
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,880
So I was like, you know what?

102
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,080
I think I'm going to get into cooperative board games.

103
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,480
I'm going to find all those.

104
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,560
We're going to play them together.

105
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,980
It's going to be fantastic.

106
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,600
So I went to a board game store.

107
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,280
Guy who is very, very helpful knew everything about board games and card games and the assorted

108
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
like.

109
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,280
And I was like, hey, I need some help getting a board game.

110
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,680
I'm just starting to get into this.

111
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,080
And he was like, okay, this one is super accessible.

112
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,960
It's called Mansions of Badness.

113
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
Brought it home.

114
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,760
There's like 4,000 pieces.

115
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,680
You need a companion app for a god damn iPad.

116
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,600
There's damage rolls and shit.

117
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,360
There's a whole thing on it.

118
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,640
And I was like, this is very exciting.

119
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,480
I don't think we're ever going to play that.

120
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,840
I don't think we're ever going to play that.

121
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,040
And accessible is a different definition, but I'm very excited about it.

122
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,720
Well, now that you've brought it up, people are going to want us to play it on a, like

123
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
a live stream or something.

124
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,800
I don't know if we're going to be able to do that.

125
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Probably not.

126
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
But that is fun.

127
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,200
If you're looking for a board game, they're a lot of fun.

128
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

129
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Yeah, for sure.

130
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,320
So, Jordan, today I've got something I'm looking forward to, and that is a nutty ass show from

131
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Alex.

132
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
I like it.

133
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,120
Today we're going to be going over December 1st and 2nd, 2020.

134
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,600
I'm Dan, this is 2020.

135
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Oh, hooray!

136
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,680
That is Tuesday and Wednesday this week.

137
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,340
And I was going to, look, here's the deal.

138
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,780
As I was getting this episode ready, we record on Thursdays, and on Thursday, Alex dropped

139
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,000
a big episode with him and Joe Rogan in the Info Wars studio.

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Of course.

141
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Of course.

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,840
And of course, this rises the bat signal.

143
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,840
But it doesn't quite rise it in the same way as Alex being on Rogan's show, because it's

144
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,240
probably not going to be nearly as interesting.

145
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
No.

146
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,100
I don't care about Joe Rogan being interviewed by somebody.

147
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,760
What does he have to say that I'm going to be interested in from an interview perspective?

148
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,720
Alex is interesting- What's it like having a hundred million dollars?

149
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,080
Alex is interesting on Rogan because he's desperately trying to steal Rogan's audience,

150
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,560
and he's trying to impress upon them that he knows things, and that he is a guru they

151
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,000
should follow away from Joe.

152
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Exactly.

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,160
Joe being on Info Wars is not that interesting.

154
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,600
Joe's probably just going to be like, ha ha, remember when we wore those masks, and ran

155
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
around Austin?

156
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
100.

157
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
We're such friends.

158
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Yeah.

159
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
I don't know.

160
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,240
Whereas, whereas Alex being on Rogan requires an emergency episode, we got to get ahead

161
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
of that thing.

162
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Yeah.

163
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,440
This, I don't fucking know.

164
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,320
I don't know if anyone will care.

165
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,360
I don't think, this is a tree falling in a forest and no one's there.

166
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Yeah, I know.

167
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,600
I don't know if that makes a sound.

168
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,120
Did you hear about it beforehand?

169
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
No?

170
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,400
I am going to listen to it, and if it's worthwhile, it'll be our episode for Monday.

171
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
For sure.

172
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,440
And if it's not, then we'll just see what's going on now.

173
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
Find something else.

174
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
It's just a regular show.

175
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,640
I know that by the time this episode is out, people might be aware of the fact that Rogan

176
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,980
did a four fucking hour episode with Alex.

177
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,720
What an asshole.

178
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,080
So we'll see on that.

179
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,880
But before we get down to business on today's episode, which, like I said, a lot of fun.

180
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,880
Okay.

181
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,880
There's a lot of...

182
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
I'm excited.

183
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
Stupid, stupid shit.

184
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
I'm excited.

185
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
I'm excited.

186
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,000
We got to take a little moment first, though, to thank some folks who have signed up and

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
are supporting the show.

188
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, that's a good idea.

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So first, Jeff A., thank you so much.

190
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,400
You are now a policy wonk.

191
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,520
I'm a policy wonk.

192
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
Thanks, Jeff.

193
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,000
Next, Dexter K., thank you so much.

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,460
You are now a policy wonk.

195
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,560

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,620
Thank you very much, Dexter.

197
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,620
Thank you.

198
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,000
Next, Jordan looks exactly like I imagined but Dan doesn't.

199
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Thank you so much.

200
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You are now a policy wonk.

201
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,080
I'm a policy wonk.

202
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,120
Thank you very much.

203
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
Thank you.

204
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,580
Next, Joe P. Thank you so much.

205
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,880
You're now a policy wonk.

206
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,940
I'm a policy wonk.

207
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,940
Thank you, Joe.

208
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,940
Thank you.

209
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,940
Next, Joseph JP.

210
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,940
Thank you so much.

211
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,940
You are now a policy wonk.

212
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,940
I'm a policy wonk.

213
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,940
Thank you very much, Joseph.

214
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,940
Thank you.

215
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,940
Next, Emily W. Thank you so much.

216
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,520
You are now a policy wonk.

217
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
I'm a policy wonk.

218
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Thanks Emily!

219
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Thank you!

220
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Next Thomas S!

221
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
Guess what?

222
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
What?

223
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
You're a policy wonk.

224
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
I'm a policy wonk!

225
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
Thanks Thomas!

226
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,760
And finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on Elevated

227
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Level.

228
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
We appreciate that very much.

229
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,280
So first, David M. Thank you so much.

230
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,800
You are now a technocrat.

231
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,120
And your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries.

232
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Thank you so much.

233
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,120
You are now a technocrat.

234
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
I'm a policy wonk.

235
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
Crikey mate, that's fantastic.

236
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Have yourself a brew.

237
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
How's your 401k doing, bro?

238
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,400
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright?

239
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,920
Let's just get down to business.

240
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,000
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

241
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,920
Why you pimps so good?

242
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,560
My neck is freakishly large.

243
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,160
I declare info war on you.

244
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,120
Thank you so much Dave and thank you so much your mother was a hamster and your father

245
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
smelt of elderberries.

246
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,680
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

247
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,000
If you are out there and you're thinking, hey I enjoy the show, I'd like to support

248
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,920
these gents too, you can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com, clicking

249
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,960
the button that says support the show, or...

250
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,320
What you could do is you could gather two to five of your friends, ages three and up,

251
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,480
put together a nice little night every week to get together, read the rule book, find

252
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,960
out, yeah well absolutely socially distance responsibly, get the rule book, by which I

253
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,680
mean find some local charities or bail funds in your area to help out and then get all

254
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,160
your friends together and get it done.

255
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
Knocked it out of the park.

256
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Thank you.

257
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
Nailed it.

258
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Thank you.

259
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,560
So real quick before we get going with the actual episode, we gotta take a look at the

260
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
mail bags.

261
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Yep.

262
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,120
And in here we got a nice little thing from Cassandra S. Jordan, you have a little box

263
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
in front of you.

264
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Yes, I do.

265
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,560
Cassandra sent me a Alex Jones coloring book, which I will try to pretend does not exist,

266
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,760
because it's supposed to be, I mean coloring books are for kids, right?

267
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
Right, right, right, right.

268
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
This is terrifying.

269
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,200
There are adult coloring books now, that's a phenomenon that people enjoy.

270
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,760
I think I have a Cthulhu coloring book, and that's probably not for kids, but Alex seems

271
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
more horrifying.

272
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,120
It's not for boring kids.

273
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,280
Oh, this is intense.

274
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,480
Elliot's espresso nib peanut butter.

275
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,120
Nut butter's grown up.

276
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,120
This is intense.

277
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
Whoa.

278
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,840
This is, do you see the coloring and everything on this?

279
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
Yeah, yeah.

280
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,040
It looks like you got peanut butter, chocolate, and espresso?

281
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
And espresso, yeah.

282
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
That's a weird butter.

283
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
It looks like that's what's going on.

284
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,280
Oh yeah, it looks like you have to shake it up, oh man, oh man.

285
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,100
I feel like you have some reticence about sort of extravagant butter.

286
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:02,640
You know, I'm excited to taste this, here's the problem that I'm seeing with this, it's

287
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
not even distribution.

288
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,960
I think you just gotta stir it.

289
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,600
I think you're right, but it's looking like there's just weird black chunks at the bottom.

290
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,560
Yeah, those are like cocoa pieces, or espresso.

291
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Cocoa nibs.

292
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Cocoa, yeah, yeah, yeah.

293
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
I'm excited, I'm gonna try it.

294
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
It looks delicious.

295
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,560
I look forward to a full report.

296
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
It looks delicious.

297
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Thank you so much, Cassandra.

298
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
Yes, thank you very much.

299
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,400
Alright, so here we go, we're jumping in.

300
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,520
December 1st, Alex opens the show with a video from the night before.

301
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
Okay.

302
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,840
He had some big breaking news, and he had to get down to it.

303
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:38,280
It's Monday night, we've been working on this story for two weeks, and now the whistleblower

304
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,680
has given us the authorization to go forward with the information you are about to see.

305
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,760
This is the first report, and several we're gonna be breaking with the documents if MSM

306
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,680
challenges this in any way.

307
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,200
This is such a perfect way for Alex to do business.

308
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,000
I love this so much because of how painfully transparent it is.

309
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,040
I don't even know, and I don't need to know what this is about, or what this alleged whistleblower

310
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,200
is claiming, because I know how this is set up.

311
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,200
This isn't how this kind of journalism works, you know, when it's being done sincerely.

312
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,160
If there actually was a whistleblower, and there actually were documents that proved

313
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,400
whatever it is they're claiming, it would be all released as a story.

314
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,920
The documents would be provided to help give credibility to the claims that the whistleblower

315
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,000
was making, because otherwise it's just a person making claims that you aren't really

316
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,840
able to fully assess.

317
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Think about it.

318
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,360
In any conceivable world, can you imagine Glenn Greenwald meeting with Snowden, then

319
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,920
announcing that he has a whistleblower who's ready to make a bunch of claims, and if anybody

320
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,600
challenges them, that's when the documents come?

321
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
It's fucking absurd.

322
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,760
I think it's a great idea, you keep it in your plus two bag of holding until you need

323
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
it.

324
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Nonsense.

325
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
It makes perfect sense.

326
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,200
They never would have acted like that because they had documents, and they had a story.

327
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,800
That did help them, yeah.

328
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,120
Without knowing anything about this whistleblower or the claims, I refuse to believe that anyone

329
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,840
would behave this way, unless this was an incredibly desperate bluff.

330
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,640
If we are challenged on it, if we are challenged on it, what does that even mean?

331
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Quantify that.

332
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,880
If somebody says, hey, what are you talking about, they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

333
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
whoa, that's not a challenge.

334
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,160
If you have a story, you'd never hold back the thing that proves your story, promising

335
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,520
to release it only if you have to.

336
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,560
That's schoolyard bully or entry level extortionist shit.

337
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,560
I will tell you guys about Deep Throat the moment someone asks, but until then, you just

338
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
gotta believe it.

339
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,120
Also, this goes entirely against Alex's entire career's guiding principle.

340
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,960
He's often told guests that if they have information, they have to get it all out or else they're

341
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,920
putting themselves at risk.

342
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Alex constantly says that his guests don't tell him anything off air, they don't say

343
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,580
on air, because he doesn't want to have secret information that other people know he has,

344
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,560
since that's when things get dangerous.

345
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
Exactly.

346
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,520
Having secrets is okay and it's too late once you've already spilled a secret, but having

347
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,720
people know that you know a secret and that you haven't said anything puts a target on

348
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
your back.

349
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
Dangerous, dangerous.

350
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,920
This is the gate of gates all over again.

351
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,000
This is exactly what happened back in 2011 when Alex interviewed Bob Chapman.

352
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,920
Bob implied that he had secret intel on Ronald Reagan, which Alex insisted he needed to say

353
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,720
on air now because he said that he had these secrets and he was in danger if he didn't

354
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,240
get it out in the open.

355
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,920
Then Bob said that he'd seen a video of Reagan getting pegged and Alex got weirded out and

356
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,840
disappointed that it wasn't something more communist.

357
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,320
Getting on air and saying that he has proof he'll produce if pushed back on is anathema

358
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,380
to Alex's entire career's methodology.

359
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,840
It's not anathema to a really sadly broken idiot trying to bluff that he has a bombshell

360
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,920
story that's actually a dud, and I say that knowing nothing.

361
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,980
I could tell you that without knowing any other thing about where this clip goes.

362
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,360
Show me Reagan getting pegged and then I'll believe you.

363
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
The end.

364
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,380
So, um, I was like, alright, I don't give a shit.

365
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,520
Like you could have said, he could have said anything afterwards and I would have been

366
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,160
disappointed because it's like if you start by saying like we have all the proof and if

367
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,280
Brian Stelter tries to get Mauvey with me I'll release the proof.

368
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
I'll do it.

369
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
No.

370
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,160
Well then why not release it now?

371
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Right.

372
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,060
Does he address that at all?

373
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,040
Why he's waiting for someone to challenge it?

374
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
I think he likes to be tricky.

375
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Oh, okay.

376
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
He likes to set traps.

377
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
It's just a little fun.

378
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
Yeah.

379
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Okay.

380
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
No, it's because he has nothing.

381
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
Oh, okay.

382
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:28,280
Anyway, this is about, uh, actually, let's see, do you think you can guess?

383
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,300
Do I think I can guess what the whistleblower whose documents might be coming out, and this

384
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,680
would have been Sunday night.

385
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,120
Uh, no, Monday night.

386
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
Monday night.

387
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,520
Um, uh, I want to say it's got something to do with Michigan.

388
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
Okay.

389
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
That's interesting.

390
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,520
That's what I'm going to go with.

391
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:54,480
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a major health executive over a 35 hospital network in Western

392
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:02,240
Pennsylvania that is exposing the fact that COVID-19 is a completely overblown power grab

393
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
scam.

394
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,960
Now we received this information directly from this whistleblower, checked out their

395
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,200
credentials and that was just the beginning of how insane this got.

396
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Yeah.

397
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
I was surprised too.

398
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
I really thought this would be something election related.

399
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Yeah.

400
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Yep.

401
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
This is a little disappointing.

402
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Yeah.

403
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,560
I didn't re I mean, I kind of, kind of forgot that Alex is spinning multiple plates.

404
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Yeah.

405
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,080
Um, so yeah, I was, I was caught on my, uh, on my back heel as they say when it was like,

406
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,720
Oh, this is a COVID thing.

407
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,640
It's almost, uh, yeah, it's, it's almost kind of ridiculous that people are still denying

408
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
COVID.

409
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
Yep.

410
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,960
I mean, it's not almost kind of, it's insanely ridiculous.

411
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,680
It was ridiculous before.

412
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,400
But it also seems like this isn't what the season is on your show, Alex.

413
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,480
It seems like this is kind of what I was thinking.

414
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,360
It seems like you got bigger issues opening the show with this 79 days of hell and we're

415
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
doing okay.

416
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
Yeah.

417
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,680
So, uh, it gets to talking about this whistleblower here and, uh, this is kind of, I don't, I

418
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,360
don't think I believe this.

419
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,560
This individuals involved in the management of 35 hospital network in Western Pennsylvania.

420
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,720
The UPMC is the name of the company.

421
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,240
UPMC stands for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the network actually includes

422
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,280
more than 35 hospitals.

423
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,500
Their website includes 36 hospital campuses, but they also have a satellite hospitals around

424
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
that they manage.

425
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,600
But, uh, you know, that are, they're included in the network.

426
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

427
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,320
The other line about UPMC is that it is a giant entity.

428
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,880
Their board of directors and executive team are all publicly listed and I would definitely

429
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,360
try and track down who Alex is talking about, but I'm sure it's not someone on that level.

430
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,760
And I just, I started to listen to this.

431
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,480
I'm like, you got these documents you're never going to fucking produce.

432
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,160
You're going to forget this even happened in a week.

433
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,420
I'm not going to amplify the disappointment by trying to figure out which name on this

434
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,760
list you're trying to allude to.

435
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,920
I'm not going to read the chicken bones that I've thrown down on the ground.

436
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,960
Yeah, yeah, I think that's, uh, I think you should have to ignore that entirely.

437
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,960
He has, for you to engage with it, he must produce one document that you can research.

438
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,120
Otherwise, he's trying to get around you specifically.

439
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,240
I've gone, I've gone so far as to find a list of names of the people he's pretending this

440
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,280
is and that's good enough for me for now.

441
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

442
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
That's, that's too much work.

443
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,720
You're, you're giving him too much credit.

444
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,440
Well, let's actually hear what this, uh, almost certainly fake person has to say.

445
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:31,000
During the latest so-called surge of COVID-19 where they claim the hospitals are all overwhelmed,

446
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
we've got to have a lockdown again, they went from 96 beds to around 600.

447
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,160
That is only 10% of the capacity they have just for COVID-19 and their hospitals are

448
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,960
basically wide open.

449
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,040
And here's the most important point, no deaths of the 600 people.

450
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,160
Most patients stayed overnight for observation because they tested positive.

451
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,840
Media will say hospitalization patients have surged over 600%, but it's the test that's

452
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:08,160
been turned up 45 times and German courts have ruled that it is a fake test 96% of the

453
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
time.

454
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,720
So Alex is reading off a bit of an Info Wars article there, but he's also just making up

455
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,860
a lot of stuff and throwing it in.

456
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,360
Here are the parts of that clip that do not even appear in the Info Wars article about

457
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,840
this whistleblower.

458
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,940
And one can only presume Alex is just saying these things to try and imply or associate

459
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,080
them with the whistleblower, which is incredibly irresponsible.

460
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,280
This whistleblower article says nothing about anyone saying all the hospitals are overwhelmed.

461
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,360
The circumstances would obviously be different in different areas where there are varying

462
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:44,120
rates of infection that lead to hospitalization and varying levels of available medical resources.

463
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,560
This article does not say that this 600 beds represents 10% of the hospital's capacity.

464
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:55,440
According to the American Hospital Directory, the hospitals that are listed as part of UPMC,

465
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,840
they add up to having 7,371 beds.

466
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,320
But the number that's cited in the blurbs, some that I can find about the network are

467
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,960
8,000, which I think is probably reasonable.

468
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Sure, sure, sure.

469
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,400
It would actually be less than 10% of that capacity, but it's kind of a meaningless

470
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,920
statistic to discuss this way, as we don't, you know, we have any information about the

471
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,480
distribution of the needed beds.

472
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,740
We don't know where the beds are at various hospitals, nor do we know how many of these

473
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,600
beds are ICU beds, or airborne isolation beds.

474
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,680
According to TribLive, as of November 20th, there were 17% availability on the latter

475
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,040
bed type, which is enough to worry people.

476
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
Yeah.

477
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,880
This is not something that can be easily captured by simple statistic, but that's what Alex

478
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,280
is trying to do, which is, you know, also in addition to the article, like it's not

479
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
in there.

480
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
The 10% of their beds.

481
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,360
I don't know if he's making that up, or, I don't know, it doesn't appear to be coming

483
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
from his whistleblower.

484
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
A alleged whistleblower.

485
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
Let's see what happens.

486
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
Why not toss it in there?

487
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,400
As for the no deaths thing among 600 hospitalized individuals, I would be interested in seeing

488
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,680
proof of that.

489
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:07,640
Pittsburgh is an Allegheny County, and on Tuesday, the day this is coming out, 18 people

490
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,960
died with COVID-19 in that county.

491
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,840
But UPMC has hospitals in other counties, too, which also have registered deaths.

492
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,360
I just don't know anything about this claim, and I just would need to see whatever documents

493
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,360
Alex has withheld.

494
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,000
So I guess I challenge it.

495
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,880
Yeah, yeah, I suppose that's the only thing you can do?

496
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,960
Yeah, I'm not MSM, but...

497
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Okay, we challenge you to produce the documents.

498
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
And a thumb war.

499
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Is that what we say?

500
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
Is that all I have?

501
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Yeah.

502
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Ah.

503
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,880
The stuff about the test being turned up 45 times does not appear in the article about

504
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,560
this whistleblower, and it seems to be Alex is putting words in their mouth.

505
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,080
Similar things, I could say, about the nonsense about the German courts.

506
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,000
What Alex is doing here is he's taking a very boring supposed whistleblower claim and then

507
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,840
riffing on it to make it seem more bombshell.

508
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,800
If you read the actual article on this, all the person appears to be claiming is that

509
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:02,720
the hospitalization in the UPMC system went up from 96 to 600 beds that were occupied

510
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,240
during this last period that's being characterized as a surge.

511
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,960
No specific data is given about these patients, just that, quote, patients were kept in observation

512
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,680
overnight and no deaths resulted.

513
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,620
This is nonspecific to the point of being meaningless, but Pennsylvania has a database

514
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,800
where you can find all the information about county-level hospital bed availability, which

515
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,160
can give you a sense of the picture if you want.

516
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:31,000
In the last available report, in the entirety of the state, there are 4,290 adult ICU beds

517
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,500
total.

518
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,920
Of those, 695 are available, which is 16%.

519
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,080
This is not to say, I mean, there's other, you know, you could look at the other statistics

520
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,800
too that you want, but there's one.

521
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:49,560
There's 16% of ICU beds are available in the entire state of Pennsylvania.

522
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,040
I can't stress this enough.

523
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,180
This is not a whistleblower delivering meaningful information, and if you read on through the

524
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,760
Infowars article about this, you kind of see what's going on.

525
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:04,140
Quote, if you start with 5 patients to 25, the media will say there's a 500% increase

526
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,320
in cases.

527
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,760
Sounds terrifying, right?

528
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,320
This article is essentially Infowars trying to explain how numbers work to their audience

529
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,360
while also trying to make them distrustful and suspicious about percentage signs.

530
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,120
Sure, a 600% increase sounds scary, but it could just be like 20 more people, so who

531
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,120
cares?

532
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,480
It's no big deal.

533
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,120
But this line of argumentation is really not good, because a jump from 5 cases somewhere

534
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,920
to 25 would definitely be a bad sign.

535
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:37,660
I don't know if you remember what the numbers were like early on in the coronavirus days,

536
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,080
but if there had been a jump like that in February, people would rightly have been worried

537
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,220
about it.

538
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,920
And if you're in a small town, let's say, that has 5 cases right now, and tomorrow there's

539
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,600
25, that would be a big deal.

540
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
That's a real problem.

541
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,980
And it would definitely be an indication of deep community transmission.

542
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,380
What Alex is attempting to do here is make this reality of rising COVID cases and hospitalizations

543
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,960
not worry his audience by taking the numbers and shrinking them.

544
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,360
It's baffling, really, because even for Alex, this is a little insulting to his audience's

545
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,520
intelligence.

546
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,580
This is him banking on them not feeling really talked down to by bringing in a fake whistle

547
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,360
blower to explain how percentages work.

548
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,280
This is really elementary stuff, and it's kind of degrading.

549
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't think highly of his audience either, but this is insulting.

550
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,020
Hey, if you only take the first few little bits of a logarithmic scale, it looks not

551
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,100
scary at all.

552
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,920
It's the last part of the parabola, if you just ignore the last part of the parabola

553
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,440
where it goes, real fast.

554
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
Sure.

555
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
Then you're going to be fine.

556
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
Yeah.

557
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
Ah, numbers.

558
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440
You don't have to worry about them.

559
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:48,320
Well, I mean, a 500% increase could be one to five, or it could be a lot more.

560
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,280
Wow, you can't prove that, though.

561
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,240
I don't even know what kind of charade is being-

562
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,760
Okay, all right, let's start here.

563
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,200
If you multiply two by two, that's so much, but that's only four.

564
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,120
And then if you multiply that by two, that seems like a lot, but that's only eight.

565
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,160
And then if you multiply that by two, that's 16, and that is quite a bit more.

566
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,240
And then if you multiply that by two, it's 32.

567
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,840
And then it's 64, and then it's 128.

568
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,480
Holy shit, man!

569
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Yeah.

570
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,560
So Alex keeps on going on.

571
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,040
This has nothing to do with the whistleblower, but he's just now, I guess, attacking the

572
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,240
idea of testing.

573
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,320
You've seen the big reports about the famous female CEO that had a test that could find

574
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,480
cancer in your blood, and it was incredible, and they made hundreds of billions of dollars,

575
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,720
and it turned out it was all a scam.

576
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,760
That's what this PCR scam is, and the inventor of it came out and said just that.

577
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,040
So a couple of things real quick.

578
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:48,320
Carey Mullis, the inventor of the PCR test, died on August 7th, 2019.

579
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,400
He did not come out and say anything about the PCR test for COVID-19 being a fraud, which

580
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,680
is what Alex is trying to imply.

581
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,840
So here is the clip that Alex immediately after plays of comments that Carey Mullis

582
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,840
has made.

583
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,080
If they could find this virus in you at all, and with PCR, if you do it well, you can find

584
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,440
almost anything in anybody.

585
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,840
It starts making you believe in the sort of Buddhist notion that everything is contained

586
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
and everything else, right?

587
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,880
I mean, because if you can amplify one single molecule up to something that you can really

588
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,720
measure, which PCR can do, then there's just very few molecules that you don't have at

589
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,760
least one single one of them in your body, okay?

590
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,080
So that could be thought of as a misuse of it just to claim that it's meaningful.

591
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,500
So that's the entire clip that Alex plays of Mullis.

592
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,640
This comment is out of context.

593
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,120
It's from a question and answer session that Mullis did about using PCR testing to detect

594
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,120
HIV back in 1993.

595
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,680
A lot of the stuff sounds applicable to the current pandemic, but it's really not.

596
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:58,160
The most damning you could make this quote out to be is to understand that maybe Mullis

597
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,920
was expressing that this form of test isn't good for determining the quantity of something

598
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,300
in somebody, rather it detects the presence or absence of it.

599
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,960
You could do that, I guess, but it's important to understand the context of these comments

600
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,760
that he was making, though, because it sounds like what he's saying is that if you look

601
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,600
at people, you can find any disease in them, but that's not the case.

602
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,240
He's talking about HIV patients and specifically about how if you have that virus, there's

603
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,120
a good chance you may have others and maybe many others.

604
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,760
He literally says that almost exactly after where Alex cuts the clip off.

605
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,640
You don't need to test for HIV.

606
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,680
You don't need to test for the other 10,000 retroviruses that are unnamed also in the

607
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
subject.

608
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,560
See, somebody that's got HIV generally is going to have almost anything that you can

609
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,760
test for because they have definitely been, HIV is a fairly rare virus.

610
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,140
At the beginning of Alex's clip, Mullis says if they find this virus in you at all with

611
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:58,440
PCR, if you do it well, you can find almost anything and anybody.

612
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,580
It's selectively edited to make it sound like Mullis is saying that using PCR, doctors can

613
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,600
find any virus in anyone.

614
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,280
In its proper context, which Alex deprives the audience of, it's clear that the virus

615
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,860
that he's referring to, so when he says if they can find this virus in you at all, he's

616
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:20,280
talking about HIV and his contention that if you can find HIV in a person, his contention

617
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,080
is that you can find most viruses, probably.

618
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,240
Also not to get too far off track here, but Carey Mullis, though the inventor of PCR testing,

619
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,480
is not someone who's remembered super well in the field of HIV and AIDS, as he was a

620
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,600
denialist of the conclusion that HIV causes AIDS.

621
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Fair, fair.

622
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,560
The point that's relevant to our situation though today is that Alex's clip that he's

623
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,520
using of Mullis to attack the use of PCR for COVID-19 testing is completely out of context

624
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,340
and doesn't mean anything.

625
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:53,840
The complaint that Alex is making about PCR testing here isn't about COVID-19 specifically,

626
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,100
it's about the entirety of PCR as a testing method, and he's expecting the audience to

627
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:04,600
believe that the inventor of PCR testing, who won a Nobel Prize for the discovery, has

628
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,600
said that it doesn't actually do anything to find anything in anybody with it, ha ha!

629
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
It's a little bit rich.

630
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,360
I would assume he said that after he got the Nobel.

631
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,800
I don't think part of your campaign for the Nobel is, honestly, this thing doesn't do

632
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
shit at all.

633
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
I dunked on you fools!

634
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:24,760
What did you say at the end, sir, tricked ya, ha ha!

635
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
Surprise!

636
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,680
I'd like to thank the Nobel board for being so fucking dumb.

637
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,840
I think the thing that...

638
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,840
That's quite an acceptance speech.

639
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
Bunch of morons.

640
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:40,020
I just, I think the problem that I have is that he didn't tell me that the video was

641
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,020
from 93.

642
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,020
Sure.

643
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,400
Like, if you tell me anything about any testing, like, if this is from 93...

644
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,000
I mean, it's 27 years old.

645
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,760
If it happened before an iPhone, then I don't know if I can use it.

646
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
I don't care yet.

647
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
Yeah.

648
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
You know what I'm saying?

649
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Well, yes and no.

650
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
No.

651
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
It's not perfect.

652
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,400
It's not like the way anybody should live their lives.

653
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,760
But if you're talking about PCR testing in 2020 versus something that Akai said before

654
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,720
the iPhone happened, I kind of think that I don't care.

655
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Sure.

656
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
You know?

657
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
Yeah.

658
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,320
If you are using science from when grunge was king...

659
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,320
Yeah!

660
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,720
Yeah, if science hasn't advanced since then, we're in trouble.

661
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Yeah.

662
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,840
If counting crows were cool when this science was around, I'm not interested.

663
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,900
It's a long November.

664
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,360
So Alex is playing this...

665
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
It is November.

666
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Good stuff.

667
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,360
Thanks, bud.

668
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,360
This is my November.

669
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
This is my December.

670
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,360
Damn it.

671
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,360
That's a Linkin Park song.

672
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,800
Anyway, Alex is playing this special report of his, and he just cuts off in the middle

673
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
of it.

674
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,200
They're banning medical doctors and epidemiologists, virologists, and scientists who come out and

675
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:55,280
point all this out because they want to use this hysteria...

676
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
For what?

677
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
What do they want to use the hysteria for?

678
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:02,400
I was overwhelmed because this episode started with him talking about this giant whistleblower

679
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,180
who has the documents that they'll be revealed if anybody flexes, and then he just cuts off

680
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,180
in the middle.

681
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,180
I'm like, wait a second.

682
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,180
Maybe that wasn't important.

683
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,180
Yeah.

684
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,180
Maybe that was filler.

685
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,160
I guess that sounds a little bit like he didn't really care about that.

686
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,000
Maybe I got tricked into researching filler.

687
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,800
You got Nobel prized, my friend.

688
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Yeah, I was like, oh, wait a second.

689
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
All right.

690
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,440
So anyway, Alex is just late for the show.

691
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,040
Okay, of course.

692
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,560
But apparently you're supposed to take that seriously.

693
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
Sure.

694
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
There is a whistleblower.

695
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
But it...

696
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Okay.

697
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,560
And he got cut off in the middle because Alex finally showed up to the office.

698
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Sure.

699
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
He was busy.

700
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,560
Oh, okay.

701
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,600
He's been waiting for this broadcast since 6 a.m. this morning.

702
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,400
And the news is so massive, so over the top, so dangerous.

703
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
But what about the whistleblower?

704
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,400
He wasn't able to go on until 12 minutes into the transmission.

705
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,440
That was five minutes ago.

706
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,440
Yeah.

707
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,720
So, okay, Alex had to take the first 12 minutes off because he was so busy working on this

708
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
news.

709
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Since 6 a.m.

710
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
Yep.

711
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,000
He was so busy that he had to distract me with another gigantic bombshell story.

712
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,480
A huge bombshell story.

713
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,600
Unfortunately, we can't spend any time on it.

714
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,880
No, because this other story is the biggest news ever.

715
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,880
Way bigger.

716
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,320
We've talked about things that Project Veritas has broken.

717
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,120
We've talked about things that Breitbart's broken.

718
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,040
We've talked about things Tucker Carlson has broken.

719
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,760
All of which are the world.

720
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,760
When they do big things to say they've broken the biggest thing ever.

721
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,620
This isn't about credit, but I have to tell you, we are breaking information on this show

722
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:36,360
today that is the biggest thing ever broken concerning this fraudulent election and what

723
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
happened.

724
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,880
This is the number one biggest, go to bed, James O'Keefe.

725
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:48,560
But I really feel like the whole Germany's courts invalidating all testing as 96% fraud.

726
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,600
I think that's a way bigger story than any election.

727
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,520
There are people dying around the world, millions of them.

728
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,960
I mean, Alex would make that argument on another day, but he was late because he was working

729
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,480
on this gigantic scoop.

730
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480
That's fair.

731
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
I messed up.

732
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:11,640
This thing is going really crazy on the 1st because there's, you know, Trump's attorney

733
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,320
Lin Wood is going batty talking about how Trump needs to declare martial law.

734
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
No, doing great.

735
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,320
Doing great.

736
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,320
Lawyers, that's what you want them saying.

737
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Sidney Powell and Rudy are going buck wild.

738
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,320
They're fantastic.

739
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,680
No, I'm glad they're getting paid a lot of money.

740
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,800
Just a lot of nutty stuff is happening.

741
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,920
So I wasn't sure what this big news Alex had to break was literally any could be.

742
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,960
I thought this was it, but it's not.

743
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,040
But I found this clip incredibly charming, but let me just drop it on you right now.

744
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:49,440
Infowars.com live show feed headline must watch Tuesday live.

745
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,640
That's got a typo, but that's okay.

746
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:58,680
Top lawyers advise Trump to declare martial law, hold new election and that headline just

747
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:08,200
went out minutes ago, my typo, myself, let's get that fixed, please.

748
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,640
Some quaint about it, but I appreciate it.

749
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,320
Yeah, that's, that's, uh, he knows that he did that.

750
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Yeah.

751
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,320
He knows that that was his typo.

752
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,320
You know what?

753
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
Can't get too mad about it.

754
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,840
You guys, somebody please fix that, please, uh, makeup.

755
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,760
If it was, if it was someone else's fault, I'd lose my shit and kill everybody here.

756
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,680
Well, he wouldn't be super furious, but he'd also be telling you how not mad he was.

757
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,680
There's something kind of quaint about just him being like, there's a typo there.

758
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,480
Yeah, that is a, that's one of those small refreshing human moments where you're like,

759
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
you know what?

760
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
At least you got that one.

761
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,520
I am about to get on air and talk about how it actually is really cool that Trump is being

762
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,480
told to declare martial law.

763
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Sure.

764
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,040
Shit, I made a typo there.

765
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,560
It's like when a tweet goes viral and it's got a typo in it, I go, no, never take it

766
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,560
back.

767
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,000
I'll never take it back.

768
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,680
Now it's been screenshotted.

769
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,240
It's interesting because you're talking about this human moment there and I think that one

770
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,760
of the things that made this episode and the content we were going to get into particularly

771
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,240
like it like kind of, I don't know, elevated to me a little bit is there's a little bit

772
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,880
of pathos in here.

773
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
Okay.

774
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,120
There's a little bit like I don't, I don't want to make you or the audience or anybody

775
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:28,200
feel any kind of pity or sympathy or empathy for Alex of as a, you know, as an actor in

776
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:34,520
this world at all, but I think that there's a, there's a point in this December 1st episode

777
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,160
where you can't help but feel like, God damn, this is sad.

778
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,400
Hey, we all still appreciate Macbeth.

779
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,760
He wasn't a good guy, but we can feel the pathos of his choices.

780
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Sure.

781
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
Sure.

782
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,400
There is a tragedy to this episode.

783
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
That's what I'm saying.

784
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
Yeah.

785
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,360
And it all begins in this next clip.

786
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Then there's this story.

787
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:03,360
I hired a respected security firm that's done security research for the army and other groups

788
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:15,000
to dig in when I was asked by the White House to investigate it three weeks ago into Dominion

789
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,520
and it being owned by the Chai-Coms.

790
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,280
We got the proof.

791
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,880
We checked it with the SEC, confirmed it two days ago, and we now publish the findings

792
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
at infowars.com.

793
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,320
Firm that owns Dominion voting systems received 400 million from a Swiss bank account with

794
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,800
connection to Chinese government before election.

795
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,000
Oh, that's a, that's a scandal.

796
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,240
There's a lot going on in there and I really enjoyed it because this like for, it's been

797
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,120
a while, but it felt like this is really a conspiracy I could dig into.

798
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,120
Okay.

799
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,120
Okay, good.

800
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,760
So the company that owns Dominion, uh, they got a bunch of money from the Chinese government

801
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,760
or something.

802
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
Sure.

803
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
This is amazing.

804
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,520
In these kinds of cases, the first thing I like to do is I like to go to Infowars and

805
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,440
see what the, uh, the articles there actually say.

806
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,780
And actually this was an instance, literally unlike any that I think I've ever encountered.

807
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,740
And that's because this article includes links to five PDF documents that are apparently

808
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,360
used to prove their case.

809
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,360
Wait, five?

810
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
I've never seen proof.

811
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,360
Five?

812
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,360
Yes.

813
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,360
Five?

814
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,360
I've never seen-

815
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,520
Not one link to a zero hedge.

816
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,080
I've never seen embedded like documents.

817
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
Full on docs.

818
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
Crazy.

819
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,080
Okay.

820
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,300
Four of them are apparently SEC documents that have the following disclaimer on top

821
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,560
of them in big letters.

822
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,580
Wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee

823
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,580
it's a good paper.

824
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,600
Quote, the Securities and Exchange Commission has not necessarily reviewed the information

825
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,940
in this filing and is not determined if it's accurate and complete.

826
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,760
The reader should not assume that the information is accurate and complete.

827
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,720
I don't hear any difference between what you read and what I said.

828
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,720
Yeah.

829
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
They're very similar.

830
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,040
This is not a good start.

831
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,580
So that's four of them.

832
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,060
And the fifth is a link that goes to a Reuters article.

833
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:06,280
This is not great in terms of documents, but there was another problem that immediately

834
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,960
jumped out at me.

835
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:13,380
The article begins with this sentence, quote, an investigation into SEC filings has revealed

836
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:19,160
that the firm which owns Dominion Voting Systems received $400 million from a Swiss bank with

837
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,680
close links to the Chinese government less than a month before the election.

838
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,080
In that clip we just heard, Alex said that the White House had asked him to look into

839
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:33,000
this three weeks ago, and then he hired a firm to do the research.

840
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,760
Where it all falls apart is there, there's an editor's note at the end of the article.

841
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
They've got to get rid of the thing.

842
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,260
Quote, a previous version of this article incorrectly credited a particular research

843
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,880
firm for performing this investigation.

844
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,200
That information was erroneous, and this article has been updated to correct that.

845
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,680
We apologize for the confusion.

846
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,000
Okay, so the research firm was not involved whatsoever.

847
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Well, that's certainly getting confusing now, isn't it?

848
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,480
Yeah, it does seem to be that way.

849
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,340
This is amazing, and it definitely indicates a problem.

850
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,920
An archived copy of this article from Before the Correction credits the investigation to,

851
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,360
quote, Austin Security and Investigation Solutions.

852
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,180
This is a real company, but based on their website, they don't appear to be a research

853
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,180
firm.

854
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,520
They're more like the kind of people you get to do an unofficial stakeout, or help you

855
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,840
make court filings.

856
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,840
Okay.

857
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,640
Maybe, like when Alex had people following his wife around.

858
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
Right, right, right.

859
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,080
So it's the type of place that also sells nanny cams if you're in the store, they've

860
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,400
got some stuff for you, and they're like, oh, we'll do a little freelance investigation.

861
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,000
If you suspect someone's cheating, maybe you have them stake out their apartment or something.

862
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
What's their type of deal?

863
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I don't know.

864
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Yeah, they're hard-boiled detectives, Dan.

865
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,120
The only thing I can conclude is that either Alex is making up that some group did this

866
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:48,840
research to make it seem more official, or he needed this company's help to find SEC

867
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,560
filings, and then he tried to credit them for the conclusions he arrived at, and they

868
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,680
told him, keep our name off this shit.

869
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,680
That sounds right.

870
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,720
I'm not going to address the reality or falsity of any of the claims about this conspiracy

871
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,360
while I explain it to you.

872
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,360
Okay.

873
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,360
Just for the sake of simplicity.

874
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,580
According to Alex, Dominion is owned by a company called Staple Street Capital.

875
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:15,200
This group received $400 million from a company called UBS Securities.

876
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,240
UBS Securities is a Swiss investment bank that also owns a company called UBS Securities

877
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,240
Company Limited, which is an investment bank that caters to the Chinese market.

878
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,140
UBS owns approximately 25% of this Chinese investment bank, with the Chinese government

879
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:35,120
being the other owner through a number of other entities.

880
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:40,400
So the conspiracy here is that the parent company of Dominion got some money from a

881
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,080
Swiss investment bank which also owns a separate bank which the Chinese government is heavily

882
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,080
invested in.

883
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,080
Okay.

884
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,600
Even if every step of this is true and no one screwed up or fudged any of the details,

885
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,220
it still doesn't prove anything.

886
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,760
This is not a meaningful connection between Dominion and China.

887
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Unfortunately, someone screwed up or fudged some details.

888
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,420
For one, this article on Infowars claims that Staple Street Capital, quote, acquired Dominion

889
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,680
Voting Systems in 2018.

890
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,920
This is kind of imprecise.

891
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,520
On July 16th, 2018, it was announced that Dominion Voting Systems, quote, has been acquired

892
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,840
by its management team and Staple Street Capital.

893
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,520
This was partially an acquisition, but not in the same way as them, like, outright buying

894
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
Dominion.

895
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,920
It was more of like a partnering and a deep investment.

896
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,920
Sure, sure, sure.

897
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,480
A little bit of a merger plus venture capital kind of mix up there.

898
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,480
It's in that territory.

899
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
Yeah.

900
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,520
Second, second, the article mentions that, quote, on October 8th, 2020, Staple Street

901
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:43,720
Capital filed SEC Form D offerings and sales amount of $400 million with the sales compensation

902
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,160
recipient identified as UBS Securities.

903
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,900
This is meant to imply that UBS Securities paid Staple Street $400 million to use Dominion

904
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:57,660
to steal the election, but the reality is that Form D with the SEC is used to report

905
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,760
on the sale of securities.

906
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,160
I hate to sound like I don't think $400 million is a lot of money, but when you're

907
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,180
in the investment market, it's not really that much to a company like Staple Street.

908
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,640
It's definitely not enough to pay them to rig a fucking election.

909
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,920
That's a comically low amount for that kind of work.

910
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,640
And also, I would assume they'd do the payoff more than a month before the election.

911
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,640
Seems, seems weird.

912
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,640
Timing?

913
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
I don't know about that.

914
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,480
Yeah, but you know, every time you see these people get bribed, I keep finding them taking

915
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,840
so little amounts of money for, like, the most- like, I could actually buy somebody

916
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:38,320
only getting $400 million to steal an election that's worth $20 trillion every day.

917
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,320
I can't.

918
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,320
You know?

919
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:45,180
Like, I see these people do, oh, we stole $50 million and I got paid $50 grand to my

920
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,360
re-election fund?

921
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,360
Like, that's what they do!

922
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,520
They're insane!

923
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,840
I think that what you're talking about is sort of the, like, boilerplate blase corruption.

924
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,080
Sure.

925
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,280
Not stealing elections.

926
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,080
Okay, that might be a bigger thing than I'm really throwing it out as.

927
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
Yeah.

928
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:07,600
Yeah, I do think that sometimes payoffs for, like, corrupt doing business kind of things

929
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,880
might not be the size that you'd imagine.

930
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

931
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,440
This is a pretty big fucking heist.

932
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,440
It is a bit of a heist, yeah.

933
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:20,600
Far more likely, this was a payment from UBS Securities for purchasing some equity of investments

934
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,480
that are held by Staples Street.

935
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,400
This does seem to be the case, since in the form that Alex links to from the SEC, it says

936
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,120
that this is, quote, equity, and quote, pooled investment fund interests.

937
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,520
The third problem is probably the one that requires the least fact-checking, but also

938
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,640
is the biggest problem.

939
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,400
Alex wants to confuse his audience and readers about the entities UBS Securities and UBS

940
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,440
Securities Company Limited.

941
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,140
UBS Securities is the one that bought securities from Staples Street, and that's the Swiss

942
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,560
Investment Bank.

943
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:54,680
UBS Securities Company Limited is the Chinese investment bank co-owned by the Chinese government

944
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,040
and UBS Securities.

945
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,000
UBS Securities Company Limited did not buy securities from Staples Street, but because

946
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,160
the names are so similar, Alex wants the audience to come away with that impression, that the

947
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,960
entity that is part-owned by the Chinese government is the one that's giving the 400 million.

948
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,740
That's not the case at all.

949
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:15,000
This is why the conclusion to this article is just unearned.

950
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,880
Quote, the revelation that Dominion Voting Systems has financial ties to the Chinese

951
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,620
government via UBS Securities will bolster claims by Trump supporters that foreign actors

952
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:28,720
working on behalf of Communist China may have sought to meddle in the presidential election

953
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,440
and help Joe Biden.

954
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,680
None of that is demonstrated by the evidence provided.

955
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,160
This is all just paper-thin bullshit Alex is trying to pass off as a smoking gun.

956
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,160
Yeah.

957
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,680
Also, I hate to crash Alex's parade here, or rain on it and crash his party simultaneously.

958
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,720
But this story was not broken by Infowars.

959
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,560
They did a post about it, an article, on December 1st, and good for them.

960
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,060
Unfortunately, this exact conspiracy, using the exact same PDF files from the SEC that

961
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:01,280
Alex linked to, was going around on QAnon Twitter as early as November 29th.

962
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,280
There we go.

963
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,560
Alex is running around like he's late for the show because of breaking news, but it's

964
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,080
a fucking basil QAnon post.

965
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,080
God damn it.

966
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,480
Alex is just taking bullshit QAnon conspiracies one of his interns finds online, and then

967
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,120
he's pretending that it's the product of an investigation that he hired a firm to do because

968
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,500
the White House asked him to.

969
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,080
This is a pathetic level of insincerity and grift.

970
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,400
When you actually realize what Alex is doing, it becomes really disgusting to think about.

971
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,800
He, as a person, knows that the White House didn't ask him to do this investigation.

972
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,920
He knows that he didn't pay Austin Securities and Investigation Solutions to find these

973
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,400
documents.

974
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,560
That's the backstory that he needs to create to make himself look like a big, strong boy

975
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:50,760
for his audience, when he might as well just be reading your crazy uncle's Facebook page.

976
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,720
It's really gross to think about.

977
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,680
He knows what he's doing.

978
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,240
Being in that moment where you're so sad that you have to take QAnon posts and pretend that

979
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:07,400
the fucking White House paid you or insist they got you because you're the best, you're

980
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,680
the bravest around, you're the only person who can get this information out, so we need

981
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,680
you to do it.

982
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:18,080
So I dug deep in my pockets and I paid the best researchers to find these SEC filings

983
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,160
that you just found on fucking QAnon.

984
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,880
Get the fuck out of here.

985
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,480
It's so sad.

986
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:30,720
Being that hollow, that weak, in that moment, it's amazing.

987
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:37,280
He's a little bit like the America's Funniest Home Videos of the Q world now, where he takes

988
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,080
... He takes stuff that you could find on the internet in two seconds that went around

989
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:45,000
yesterday and packages it in for people who only watch TV.

990
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,800
He's like Tosh.0, but if Tosh was like, I got these from the fucking Chairman Mao himself.

991
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,240
You stumbled onto actually a really good metaphor, and it's why America's Funniest-

992
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,240
Stumbled onto?

993
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:03,680
Well, it's why America's Funniest Home Videos was a big ratings driver, and something like

994
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,960
Tosh.0 is fine, but whatever, it wasn't that great because the internet did exist.

995
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,840
You could find those videos then.

996
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,880
Back when America's Funniest Home Videos was on, that was the only game in town.

997
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,880
Just like Alex.

998
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,880
Exactly.

999
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,880
There was a time-

1000
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,880
But then the internet existed.

1001
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,800
There was a time when he was the only person who could provide you with nut shots.

1002
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:29,160
And America's Funniest Home Videos still exists now in much the sad place that Alex Jones

1003
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,160
exists.

1004
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,160
Yeah.

1005
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,160
Brutal.

1006
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,800
Yeah, that means QAnon is-

1007
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,800
Zagat?

1008
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,800
Is Tosh.0?

1009
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,800
Is QAnon Bob Zagat?

1010
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,800
No.

1011
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,800
Just Bob Zagat's later career?

1012
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,800
Bob Zagat might actually be QAnon, though.

1013
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,800
That might be true.

1014
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,800
I'm not entirely sure.

1015
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,800
I could buy it.

1016
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,800
So Alex-

1017
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,800
The Aristocrats.

1018
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,800
So now that-

1019
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:53,160
Yeah, The Aristocrats, just the family is telling the story of like, all right, so there's

1020
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,160
a cabal.

1021
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,680
What do they call the cabal?

1022
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,680
The Aristocrats.

1023
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,680
The Aristocrats.

1024
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,680
All right.

1025
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:05,240
So, Alex is like, this story is not good.

1026
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,420
It doesn't work.

1027
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,760
The proof that he has doesn't back up the claims.

1028
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,820
There isn't like, these documents don't show nefariousness to the level that he's implying.

1029
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,440
And it's all just stuff he's cribbing from QAnon.

1030
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,480
And he just won't give up this charade that he's on.

1031
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,480
This is so huge.

1032
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:29,400
But let me give you the big Infowars exclusive of two big Infowars exclusives that the system

1033
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:37,080
is fighting and battling as hard as it can to make sure it does not get out to anybody.

1034
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:43,840
Firm that owns Dominion Voting Systems received 400 million from Swiss Bank with connection

1035
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,320
to Chinese government before election.

1036
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,840
So yeah, man, they're trying to keep this under wraps.

1037
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,840
Oh boy.

1038
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,880
It's Infowars exclusives.

1039
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,720
Now when Alex is going over the story, it's interesting because I guess he hasn't got

1040
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,040
the memo.

1041
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:04,160
The investigation conducted by Austin Security and Investigation Solutions centers on Staples

1042
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,560
Street Capital.

1043
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:12,760
Certainly hope you won't have to give an apology publicly to Austin Security Solutions.

1044
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:18,000
I wonder if they have anything to say about you associating them with your bullshit that

1045
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,880
you took from QAnon while you were on the air.

1046
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,680
I wonder if they're thrilled about that.

1047
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,000
I think we should see what they think.

1048
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I wonder.

1049
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Yeah.

1050
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,640
I would have maybe checked in on it, but I don't like to stir the pot.

1051
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,640
Ah, come on now.

1052
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:36,280
Anyway, Alex, as he's going over the story too, the story sucks.

1053
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,280
It doesn't work.

1054
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,280
Sure.

1055
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,040
But it sucks even more because he just makes up conclusions.

1056
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:47,360
So the real headline is Chinese Communist government caught laundering 400 million through

1057
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,600
Swiss Bank to Dominion month before election.

1058
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,600
Whoa.

1059
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,600
Whoa.

1060
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,160
Well, you got me there.

1061
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,720
That whoa, I can't hear it any other way than it being Alex, like kind of being impressed

1062
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,720
with himself.

1063
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,720
Yeah.

1064
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,720
I can't believe I did that.

1065
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,720
Whoa.

1066
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,720
Look at this shit.

1067
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,720
This sounds real.

1068
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,720
We got five PDFs.

1069
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:13,640
Admittedly, four of them say, don't believe anything in these, but we're still doing great.

1070
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:20,280
One time I was riding my bike and I went down a hill and I lost control of the bike and

1071
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:27,040
I was able to get a shoulder down on my way down and I ended up rolling and I got like,

1072
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:32,540
it was one of the coolest things that no one else saw is I landed more or less like I had

1073
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,540
meant to do it.

1074
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,540
Sure.

1075
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,540
Sure.

1076
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,540
Sure.

1077
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,540
Yeah.

1078
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,540
You did a little bit of an acrobatic move.

1079
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,540
It was all an accident.

1080
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:44,480
It was all just landing exactly coincidentally how I needed to, to roll over and then sort

1081
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,480
of be on my feet.

1082
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,480
Sure.

1083
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,160
All of a sudden you just woke up in the gymnast pose, like bowing to the judges that aren't

1084
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,160
there.

1085
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,160
And yeah.

1086
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,160
Whoa.

1087
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,160
Whoa.

1088
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,160
Whoa.

1089
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,160
Yeah.

1090
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,160
That's kind of that.

1091
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,160
It does.

1092
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,160
It does have a little bit of that same feel.

1093
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,160
I just fucking said that I proved that China paid dominion.

1094
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,160
Whoa.

1095
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:07,420
It is a little bit like the first time you throw a rolled up piece of paper into a garbage

1096
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:12,560
can in the office from a ways away and everybody sees it and you're like, whoa, this always

1097
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,040
happens when no one's looking.

1098
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,040
Holy shit.

1099
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,040
I got this one.

1100
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:23,480
I mean, but for Alex, like everyone who's in the studio is like, no one's impressed.

1101
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,360
Anyway, this is so sad to me.

1102
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,280
Like I understand.

1103
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:35,100
I, I, I can, I can see the audience, our audience, and everyone's laughing at Alex and I don't

1104
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,200
begrudge you for it.

1105
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:43,600
And I probably am only sad because I'm overly invested in, in this sort of like this story.

1106
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,600
Right.

1107
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,600
Right.

1108
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:51,600
And it's so sad to me to see this guy who knows that he's lying about impressed with

1109
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:57,600
himself, but, but, but, but lying about why you should be impressed with him like it's,

1110
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,600
this is so gross.

1111
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:04,800
Now I was put on the lead of this by a very high level individual in the white house and

1112
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,800
I said, why me?

1113
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,080
And they said, look, we already know it's there.

1114
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,520
This has to be independent.

1115
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,520
You need to go find it.

1116
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:17,420
So I hired a security firm and I told him dig, and then this came in and it's all confirmed.

1117
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:22,760
Like he has to create this, this whole spy novel where the white house is like, you're

1118
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,760
there.

1119
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,760
Oh, that you're independent.

1120
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,760
This has got to come from the outside.

1121
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,260
What the fuck?

1122
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,600
This sounds like Pachannik wrote it for him.

1123
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:35,840
I mean, even, even kind of a, so the white house came to me and told me to investigate

1124
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,400
things and this is what showed up.

1125
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,320
I can tell you that Steve didn't.

1126
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,320
Okay.

1127
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:45,960
Because Steve does show up later and Alex brings some of this up to him and Steve's

1128
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,040
really not into it.

1129
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,040
Not for it.

1130
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,040
Okay.

1131
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,040
Of course.

1132
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,040
But, but some...

1133
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,040
Steve's got a zag.

1134
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,040
Some Steve-ish person, perhaps.

1135
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,040
Yeah.

1136
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,040
This is very Stevie.

1137
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,040
Yeah.

1138
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,040
Yeah.

1139
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:04,920
I don't know what the deal is or like, you know, obviously this came from like QAnon

1140
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,560
posts and online conspiracy swamp nonsense.

1141
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:12,960
And Alex is the basis for Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan character.

1142
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,920
But man, the, the patheticness of coming up with how important you are and, and needing

1143
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:23,920
to project that to the audience is just like, God damn, I don't, I don't know how I, I don't

1144
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,200
know how you could live like that.

1145
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,720
It's just so false.

1146
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,720
Totally.

1147
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:33,600
Anyway, in this next clip, Alex is getting down to business on the Linwood situation.

1148
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:39,680
The president's lawyer who has said that Trump needs to call for martial law and hey, why

1149
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,120
not call for a new election?

1150
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,120
Yeah.

1151
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,120
Why not?

1152
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,640
Do you think Alex is for or against this idea?

1153
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,840
I'm going to go with for, but I would even almost argue against the new election part.

1154
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,440
Just stick with martial law for a bit.

1155
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,440
He's just for it all.

1156
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,440
Okay.

1157
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,000
And I'm going to go ahead and again, read you this headline right here.

1158
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:05,680
Tony Linwood, president Trump should declare martial law and hold new election.

1159
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:12,520
Then he goes through in this full page article, full page ad, can still pay to get your speech

1160
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,520
out, I guess in America.

1161
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,600
And I totally agree with his constitutional analysis.

1162
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,400
Hey, totally agrees with Linwood that we need to just fucking have a new election because

1163
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,400
he lost.

1164
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,240
Why are you guys wasting my time even saying a new election?

1165
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,240
Shut up.

1166
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,440
Like if he wins that one, you guys are going to be like, well, I guess we were wrong this

1167
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,440
time.

1168
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,440
Yeah.

1169
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,440
Like if Biden wins this time.

1170
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,440
Get the fuck out of here.

1171
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,440
Yeah.

1172
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,440
Come on.

1173
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,440
Like you are one, like you're going to let the election be whatever.

1174
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,440
Yeah.

1175
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,440
Yeah.

1176
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,440
Yeah.

1177
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,440
Yeah.

1178
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,440
Shut the fuck up.

1179
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,440
Just say you want Trump to be president for life and you'll destroy the Republic for it.

1180
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,440
Hey, Jordan, shut up.

1181
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,440
Yeah.

1182
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,240
The only way there could be a fair election is if it didn't happen.

1183
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,200
Is this a, is this a Zen Cohen?

1184
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,640
Trump voting machines, Trump branded voting machines.

1185
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,640
It's the only way to be sure.

1186
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:01,320
It's the only way you can trust that it's impartial if they are made by Trump's company.

1187
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,320
All right.

1188
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,320
Let me pitch you this.

1189
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,320
All right.

1190
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,560
Everybody but Trump's own companies are against him.

1191
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,560
Exactly.

1192
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,560
Obviously.

1193
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,560
All right.

1194
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,560
He makes his own voting machines.

1195
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,720
They look very similar to him.

1196
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,520
They've got a computer screen where his chest is.

1197
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:20,400
If you press for Biden, a little container opens up, a little gun comes out, boom.

1198
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,400
Gotta vote for Trump.

1199
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,400
Every time.

1200
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,400
The gun swabs you.

1201
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,400
The Trump Dalek.

1202
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,400
Yes.

1203
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,400
Yeah.

1204
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,400
Yeah.

1205
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,400
Anyway.

1206
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,120
Um, Alex, uh, one of the reasons that there needs to be a new election is, uh, this story.

1207
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:38,240
By the way, they now have a dominion engineer in the key County in Georgia, walking up illegally,

1208
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,600
plugging a thumb drive in, walking out with it for a few hours, coming back and plugging

1209
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,040
it back in totally illegal.

1210
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,040
That's how you change votes.

1211
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,340
I mean, we have them folks.

1212
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:46,340
We have them.

1213
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,340
We have them.

1214
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,600
Alex doesn't even know what County this video is from.

1215
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,600
It's a key County.

1216
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,600
Please.

1217
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,240
He doesn't even care about this shit at all.

1218
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,920
He's just literally repeating QAnon posts from social media.

1219
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,920
He saw it.

1220
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,060
This is just another one.

1221
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:02,080
This was a QAnon witch hunt that started from a video of a dominion tech net technician

1222
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:06,760
doing their job, which in the imagination of these idiots on social media became proof

1223
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,720
of a person changing votes.

1224
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,680
The proof that's given for this is that people watching the video assume that must be what

1225
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,680
the guy's doing.

1226
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,680
Therefore it's been proven.

1227
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,200
It's almost comically dumb.

1228
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,200
Yeah.

1229
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,200
That is very stupid.

1230
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,200
What's more profitable is the fact that the major players of the Q bullshit were amplifying

1231
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,760
and leading a dachshund campaign against this dominion employee who is now almost certainly

1232
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,440
afraid for his life.

1233
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,320
This employee was not manipulating votes, but now because of people like Alex Jones

1234
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:38,200
and Ron Watkins, a huge chunk of the public thinks that he's either definitely or probably

1235
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,660
guilty of changing votes.

1236
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:45,420
This is a real person who's been singled out and had a nefarious story written about him

1237
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:51,380
for no reason, except to satisfy the corruption lust of a disenchanted group of conspiracy

1238
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,380
lunatics.

1239
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,580
And now he's got people tweeting nooses at him.

1240
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:56,580
So fun.

1241
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:02,040
Yeah, QAnon, the conservative media has essentially turned all of the internet into the Eye of

1242
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,920
Sauron and if at any time points upon you, you'll be destroyed.

1243
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,520
Yeah, and good job just amplifying that, Alex, and good job learning the lessons of your

1244
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,520
career.

1245
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,480
And good job, good job figuring out the things that have gotten you in trouble in the past

1246
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,640
and then continuing to do those things.

1247
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:23,200
Yeah, I mean, you know, he has in a way learned the lessons, which is that there are no negative

1248
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,920
consequences except for people who aren't him and he doesn't care about them.

1249
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,000
Well, at least he doesn't bring up the guy's name, so there's that.

1250
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,640
Anyway, we need martial law.

1251
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,040
And the reason we do is because there's already martial law or maybe something, I don't know.

1252
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,040
Sure, whatever.

1253
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,040
This is the UN global takeover.

1254
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:44,720
So the response is martial law to stop their martial law and arrest them.

1255
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,720
That makes sense.

1256
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,040
Yeah, we need a coup to stop the counter coup.

1257
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,480
Yeah, we got to coup the couers before they coup us and they'll be couped.

1258
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,080
We need martial law in order to fight martial law.

1259
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,080
And you know what?

1260
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,320
Trump kind of has to do it.

1261
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,320
He does.

1262
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,760
Roger Stone calls on Trump to seize total power and assert martial law.

1263
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,440
What he said was he has total power in the constitution.

1264
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,680
If they have dominion software and fraudulent stuff, he has to move and seize those.

1265
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:15,440
If the FBI and the courts won't act, he has to declare the civil emergency.

1266
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,560
He's the executive protect the republic.

1267
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,840
This is when you do it.

1268
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:26,760
I'm an expert on martial law, ladies and gentlemen, wanted to have it through Obama or the Clintons

1269
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,180
to take our guns.

1270
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:31,480
This is them doing it to move the president out to do it.

1271
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:37,520
This is their UN globalist medical martial law, as the archbishop and others have called

1272
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,960
it's what it is to circumvent the government and hope the government just stands back and

1273
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,080
watches it all happen.

1274
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,640
I got to say after that clip, I really do think that he is an expert on martial law.

1275
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,520
Um, and, uh, yeah.

1276
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,520
Okay.

1277
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,520
Okay.

1278
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:54,000
So if I understand this correctly, the UN is declaring martial law.

1279
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Yeah.

1280
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,440
So Trump has to declare martial law in order to stop the UN's martial law.

1281
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,440
Right.

1282
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,180
Now I'm going to toss this out there for you as a possibility.

1283
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:06,720
So Trump has declared martial law and martial law is declared.

1284
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,520
What if the UN just removes Trump?

1285
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,280
We're, we're still in martial law.

1286
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,280
What do you mean?

1287
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,360
I mean like once we're in martial law, it doesn't matter.

1288
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,840
Somebody's going to be the martial law person forever.

1289
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:23,760
Well, you know, in Alex's world, that's forever.

1290
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,280
That's something that has always been a part of his ideas.

1291
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,280
Right.

1292
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,080
Now, let me, let me float this.

1293
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:38,080
Look, their martial law is bad and it'll happen forever because you can't trust anybody.

1294
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:42,880
Once they get in power, they'll never get out of power, except for Donald Trump because

1295
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,880
he's really cool.

1296
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,880
Right.

1297
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,440
So you just got to let him have martial law temporarily, which I have told you on many

1298
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,920
occasions is impossible and doesn't exist, but it will.

1299
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,600
Trust me, he just wants to clean stuff up and then he'll get, he'll stop the martial

1300
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,600
law.

1301
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,600
Right.

1302
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,120
But it seems like you're just getting rid of one of the steps that they would have to

1303
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,120
take.

1304
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:04,160
Because then they could just kill him and you're already under martial law.

1305
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,680
And then they don't even have to bring in their people.

1306
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,520
I don't know how Alex would respond to that.

1307
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,520
Yeah, I don't know.

1308
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,920
I mean, it's just dumb.

1309
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,000
It's very stupid.

1310
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,440
For Mr. Martial Law, Mr. Anti-Martial Law, whose whole career has largely been about

1311
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:26,000
how tyrants never give up power once they achieve, you know, like some modicum of power.

1312
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:32,080
Like for him to be like, no, we need a dictatorship for a short time in order to solve the problems

1313
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,120
of my imaginary enemies.

1314
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,120
That's great.

1315
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,040
It's just kind of silly.

1316
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,500
It's not, it's not funny.

1317
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,500
It's sad.

1318
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,500
Yeah.

1319
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,500
It's very pathetic.

1320
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:46,300
Listening to somebody talk like that and not be challenged with just like the simplest

1321
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:48,720
of like, uh, that's dumb.

1322
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,720
Yeah.

1323
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:55,360
From anyone around them, from their longtime listeners, audience, from a voice within themselves.

1324
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,360
Yeah.

1325
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,360
Something.

1326
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,600
Anything pushing back and being like, do you even, do you hear yourself?

1327
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,600
Yeah.

1328
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,600
Yeah.

1329
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,600
Yeah.

1330
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,600
Get the fuck out of here.

1331
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,600
Yeah.

1332
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,600
It's like, it's a wonderful life, but instead of the angel showing up, he just jumps.

1333
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,600
Yeah.

1334
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,440
At the beginning, he's just like, eh, fuck it.

1335
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,720
Or like a Christmas Carol, but like all the ghosts are like, Scrooge, you're great.

1336
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,720
You're the best.

1337
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,640
You're just so great, man.

1338
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,200
You are just doing so good.

1339
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,960
When you die, you're going to get to hang with us.

1340
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,600
We're going to have a great old time.

1341
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,160
Hey, hey, Christmas morning, here's what you got to do.

1342
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,160
Beat up Tiny Tim.

1343
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,160
Take his crutch.

1344
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,160
Take his fucking crutch, man.

1345
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,160
Yeah.

1346
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,160
Yeah.

1347
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,160
Get him.

1348
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,160
Get him.

1349
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,160
As in death, so is life.

1350
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,160
Whoo.

1351
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,160
The ghost of Christmas past just, get him.

1352
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,160
Get him.

1353
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,160
Uh, yeah.

1354
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,160
That's good stuff.

1355
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:45,160
It's just getting dictatory as hell up in here.

1356
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,680
Therefore, we the people must demand.

1357
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,680
Real quick.

1358
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,640
He's reading Linwood's statement that he's made.

1359
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,640
It's a long statement.

1360
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,640
Alex reads most of it.

1361
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:58,800
I don't care, but anyway, here, this is just a part of that and Alex's take on it.

1362
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:04,880
Therefore, we, the people must demand a new and fair national vote, a vote that all Americans

1363
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,760
can trust and live by regardless of the winner.

1364
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:15,560
Without a fair vote, we fear, with good reason, the threat of a shooting civil war is imminent.

1365
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:20,320
Gun sales are at all time high and 40% for the first time gun owners looking to defend

1366
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,480
themselves, their property and their rights.

1367
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:29,480
Therefore we must act now before there is no peaceful way left to preserve our nation.

1368
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,080
Exactly why the Chai comms and the UN do this?

1369
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:37,640
Because even if Trump removes the fraud, there'll be a civil war if he goes through the fraudulent

1370
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,640
system.

1371
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,340
It needs to be, it's Chai comm attack.

1372
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,180
He has to arrest the heads of the media.

1373
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,200
He has to arrest them.

1374
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:49,760
They're all Chinese agents, all the proof, and we have to just go after them and have

1375
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,760
Nuremberg trials.

1376
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,800
I mean, this is an attempt to take over.

1377
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,800
Wow.

1378
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:54,800
Okay.

1379
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,400
So I guess we've got to arrest them, the heads of the media.

1380
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,400
Okay.

1381
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,400
Okay.

1382
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,640
So if I am sounding familiar, if I understand correctly, even if Trump uses the system to

1383
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,120
root out the corruption, there's going to be a civil war.

1384
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,120
Well, yeah.

1385
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,120
Yeah.

1386
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:15,400
However, if Trump instantly and extemporaneously arrests all the heads of the media, right.

1387
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,560
Takes care of all of the generals that he doesn't like, removes everybody in government,

1388
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,560
dissolves the Senate.

1389
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,560
Yeah.

1390
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,560
No civil war.

1391
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,560
Well, dissolves the house at least.

1392
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,560
Oh, well at least.

1393
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,560
Yeah.

1394
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,560
I mean the Senate for now is fine.

1395
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,560
Yeah.

1396
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,560
We'll keep that one in the Supreme Court.

1397
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,560
Yeah.

1398
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,560
Yeah.

1399
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,560
It's strange.

1400
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,560
So that one wouldn't start a civil war is what you're saying to me.

1401
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,800
Here's, I mean, it's obviously a veiled threat.

1402
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:36,800
Yes.

1403
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:41,480
I'm pretty sure it's very much a, you give us Trump or we kill all of you as a threat.

1404
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,880
Why are we even acting like he's calling for a new election?

1405
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,880
He said, give us Trump or we kill you.

1406
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:46,880
No, no, no.

1407
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,120
There is a circumstance where in the new election would be acceptable.

1408
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:55,560
Now a new election, just on these same voting machines owned by China.

1409
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,560
Right.

1410
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,560
No.

1411
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,560
Right.

1412
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,880
We can't have a new election because that'll just get stolen too.

1413
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,880
Okay.

1414
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:02,880
What about paper ballots?

1415
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,880
Great.

1416
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,640
They have to be counted by Trump family members.

1417
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:11,440
I'm starting to feel like you guys want this to be in your favor.

1418
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,840
Was gerrymandering not enough for you?

1419
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,840
Apparently not.

1420
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,840
Yeah, well.

1421
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:21,480
It's really funny, Linwood and Sidney Powell have their press conference on the second

1422
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,360
day of this, I believe on December 2nd.

1423
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:29,280
And maybe it was on the first, I can't remember what day it was, but they are like, yeah,

1424
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,040
and we're not going to participate in this Georgia election.

1425
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,040
Don't vote.

1426
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,040
Don't vote.

1427
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,040
Don't do it.

1428
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,040
I guarantee it.

1429
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,440
I think it's a terrible idea.

1430
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,840
I love that.

1431
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:42,680
And Trump, I wish you had balls to veto that defense bill.

1432
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:46,160
Alex doesn't have any take on that stuff.

1433
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:51,280
Although I thought that would be the most interesting, like Sidney Powell and Linwood

1434
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,560
telling people not to vote in the Georgia runoff.

1435
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,560
I'm all for it.

1436
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,560
I'm all for it.

1437
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:00,640
It's going to give a very significant advantage to the Democratic candidates.

1438
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,640
Yes.

1439
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,640
Please.

1440
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,640
Why?

1441
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,080
This is what I've been waiting for the whole time.

1442
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:09,800
We can't be cooed and taken over by the dumbest people on the planet.

1443
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,880
They need to dumb it up so much we don't even have to work for it, Dan.

1444
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,920
I, I, yeah, I'm very interested in that.

1445
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,500
And then also I was, I would be very interested in Alex's take on Trump's, uh, you know, threatening

1446
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,500
to veto the NDAA.

1447
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,500
The 230?

1448
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,500
Yeah.

1449
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,500
Oh yeah.

1450
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,500
Well, because that has to do with the 230.

1451
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,500
Yeah, exactly.

1452
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:31,120
Um, because Alex should hate the NDAA.

1453
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,120
Right.

1454
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,120
Because he does.

1455
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,120
Yes.

1456
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,480
So he should be in favor of Trump vetoing that.

1457
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,480
Right.

1458
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,960
But he also wants to get back on Twitter.

1459
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:44,600
Well, it's such a complicated position.

1460
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,520
He's finally forced into the most nuanced position of his career and he's reacting the

1461
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:51,280
way we all knew he would pretending it's not happening.

1462
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,000
Let me go ahead and gamble.

1463
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,060
Uh, he forgets he doesn't like the NDA.

1464
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:56,060
It's weird.

1465
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,760
It's weird how he won't remember that very shortly.

1466
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,760
Yeah.

1467
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:04,320
But he does remember that he paid people a lot of money to dig up this story about China

1468
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,320
and dominion.

1469
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,320
Okay.

1470
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:12,080
So he goes out, this is the total proof hiding in plain view and we have put it out for you

1471
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:17,160
and hired the big investigative team to dig through all this and they tried to hide it,

1472
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,800
but they failed.

1473
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:19,800
They tried to hide it.

1474
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:25,200
The subsidiary names and subgroups, but we tracked it all back and we have it now separately

1475
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,360
going to break in just a few seconds, a promo code Patriot, you get an additional 10% off.

1476
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,360
All right, man.

1477
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,360
Yeah.

1478
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,880
I think he's got a good point.

1479
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,840
I think you can only own one business, the end.

1480
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:44,820
No, none of this UBS, none of this, uh, this is steel and staples and UBS company limited

1481
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:45,820
and UBS.

1482
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:48,000
So it's 25% no one business per.

1483
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,400
I don't think you have any idea how complicated it is.

1484
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,400
One business per.

1485
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,400
All right.

1486
01:05:53,400 --> 01:06:00,360
I mean, I do sometimes forget that you have a degree in small business administration.

1487
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:05,040
One business per.

1488
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,640
Not just that, not just very dumb.

1489
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,640
Everyone gets one.

1490
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:14,920
I understand that corporate structures are confusing and sometimes a bit complicated

1491
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:21,720
to the untrained eye, simplify it by making it impossible to work.

1492
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:22,720
Great.

1493
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,720
Good.

1494
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,720
Exactly.

1495
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,720
That was my idea.

1496
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,720
Yeah.

1497
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:31,320
I mean, Alex continues to bring up this dominion employee who's been getting lots of threats

1498
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:36,240
and I would say this is a bad idea, but at least, at least he's not saying his name or

1499
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,240
anything.

1500
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,120
And I'm going to come back and recap the top news and then show you footage of dominion

1501
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:44,100
worker reportedly caught manipulating voter data.

1502
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,780
What they did was illegal on tape.

1503
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,440
We actually know who he is.

1504
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:51,040
We're not going to release his name yet, but we've got the Intel and so do our people.

1505
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,840
Uh, but this is incredible.

1506
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,040
This will not stand global as you've been caught.

1507
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,520
We do not accept your fraudulent leader, your chai comm agent, Joe Biden.

1508
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,520
You're on notice.

1509
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,440
Remarkable restraint on Alex's part.

1510
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,600
Not saying this person's name because, you know, I mean that that's kind of a big part

1511
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,880
of what's gotten him in trouble in the past, which is, you know, leading and amplifying

1512
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:17,160
kind of campaigns that seek to harass, threaten, intimidate private citizens.

1513
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:21,560
Uh, so I hope, you know, I hope, I hope he doesn't get into that.

1514
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,560
Yeah.

1515
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:29,000
I think it's, I think it's so weird how willing he is to go after individual people.

1516
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
How weird.

1517
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,360
Like I think that's the only way he can really assert power.

1518
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,360
I suppose.

1519
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,000
Cause I don't think anybody else is scared of him.

1520
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Like right.

1521
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Doesn't give a fuck.

1522
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
That's fair.

1523
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,680
James, the guy who owned comet ping pong was ready to take him to court.

1524
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:48,080
Like he, Alex backed down hard when those people were like, no, fuck you.

1525
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,080
Yeah.

1526
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:51,520
Uh, people like a day of David Rothschild.

1527
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,400
He showed up on Alex's show and talked to him for like half an hour.

1528
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,760
Bill Ayers showed up and was like, what are you talking about?

1529
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:59,760
Yeah.

1530
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,120
Like these people aren't afraid of him.

1531
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,120
You know who is?

1532
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,120
Someone who could be hurt.

1533
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,120
Random strangers.

1534
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,120
Yeah.

1535
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:12,120
But I, like I said, man, there's pathos, there's pathos because you can really tell that Alex

1536
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:17,120
loves telling this story about how Trump's people told him to get to the bottom of this

1537
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,760
dominion thing.

1538
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:23,720
It's so sad when you know, what's up, and this is just a conspiracy from Cuban onboards.

1539
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,400
God, this is so sad.

1540
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:31,480
We are living in the most incredible time in world history on so many fronts, but I

1541
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:40,360
got a call from the president's representative and they asked me three weeks ago when I was

1542
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,360
in Arizona.

1543
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:48,720
Uh, let's just say one of Trump's sons gave me a call and he put me in touch with a, a

1544
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,280
executive, uh, with a major voting machine company.

1545
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,280
I'm gonna leave it at that.

1546
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:56,900
And they said, look, we know Soros, the Chinese are involved.

1547
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:00,080
We want you to investigate it and we want you to separately bring it out.

1548
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,440
And I said, well, if you know it, why, why do I have to find it?

1549
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:06,920
And they said, look, I said, oh, cause it's, it's classified and I've got to find it myself.

1550
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,400
They said, we're not saying that.

1551
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:14,120
Well, I got a call two days ago from the security firm I hired, uh, that were former army internal

1552
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,100
security, uh, researchers.

1553
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,640
So they're good, good researchers.

1554
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:25,480
And they ferreted out and found that 75 plus percent of a major Swiss UBS bank investment

1555
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:32,280
firm is owned by the communist party, a central committee and by one of their major provinces

1556
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:42,840
and that they put all of this money, 400 million into dominion.

1557
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:47,360
I just can't get over how pathetic this is.

1558
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,360
Yeah.

1559
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:52,760
This is like a school kid bragging about like their dad being Superman.

1560
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,760
Yeah.

1561
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:59,000
You know, like the president will all just say, I'll leave it at one of his sons called

1562
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,760
me and said, you got to get, Ooh, is it cause it's classified?

1563
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,760
We're not saying that.

1564
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:04,760
Cause it's not.

1565
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:05,760
Yeah.

1566
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:06,760
SEC filings.

1567
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:10,000
It's a, it's a little bit like a, um, like a con man.

1568
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,200
Uh, it's very much like, no, no.

1569
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,200
Yeah.

1570
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,720
I mean he is a con man, but I'm, I'm, this particular one reminds me of like the old

1571
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:21,580
ones where it's somebody with a vaguely European accent who's talking to the New York stock

1572
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:27,320
exchange people like, yes, I'm a representative of King Harold and uh, he's trying to keep

1573
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,320
it all secret.

1574
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,360
Very, very secret of course.

1575
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:32,780
But if you loan me $1 million, I'll be able to, yeah.

1576
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:37,220
And if you know that the King is, you're like, you're a fucking lunatic, man.

1577
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:40,760
If you're not pulling it off, you look like an insane person.

1578
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:41,760
Yeah.

1579
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:42,760
Yeah.

1580
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:46,960
And uh, you know, simultaneously I can see this and he is not pulling it off.

1581
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:47,960
Right.

1582
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:53,840
But there's probably enough people who are just dumb or just captured by him and think

1583
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:59,040
that he means a goddamn word he says, and that's really sad.

1584
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:02,400
It's really sad for them and it's really sad for Alex.

1585
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,400
Yeah.

1586
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,400
It really is.

1587
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,400
Yeah.

1588
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:10,600
Just on a human level that he's a 40 something year old man, 46, 47 year old man who's in

1589
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:17,300
his studio bragging complete bullshit lies about the president's son telling him to do

1590
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:20,840
this investigation that he just saw in a QAnon board.

1591
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:23,800
Well when you put it in that context, it sounds bad.

1592
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,800
It is.

1593
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,340
Anyway, it's also like, this is just, it's painful to me.

1594
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:35,280
Like I had a really tough time with the first half of this December 1st episode because

1595
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,280
it is this.

1596
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:40,580
It's, it's, it's, this dude is just a sad mope.

1597
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:46,140
This is 1 trillion percent the smoking gun and then it just gets worse from there.

1598
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:52,240
The communist Chinese wired through a secretive Swiss bank account, $400 million to Dominion

1599
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,960
on October 7th.

1600
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,960
I mean, wow.

1601
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,920
I suggest you go get these documents.

1602
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,840
I suggest you get them out and I don't normally say sources and things like that, but you

1603
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,600
know, I want you to know how real this is.

1604
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,600
Okay.

1605
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,320
It's just, just a bummer.

1606
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,320
Yeah.

1607
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,320
Oh boy.

1608
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:16,320
And the other thing that's really sad about this is like, if you really look at it from

1609
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:24,600
a professional perspective, Alex is reduced to taking something from QAnon circles, pretending

1610
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,800
it's not that, and then just trying to resell it.

1611
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,380
Anybody who's like engaged in those QAnon communities would see this and be like, oh,

1612
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:34,380
we already knew that.

1613
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:36,720
We knew this days before your article came out.

1614
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:40,080
This is old news to real conspiracy heads.

1615
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,720
Like it's, it's, he's trailing behind the thing that he thinks is a rip off of himself.

1616
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,720
Right.

1617
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,520
And it's just, man, you should quit.

1618
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,520
You should just quit.

1619
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,520
Yeah.

1620
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,520
If Shakespeare were alive today.

1621
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,520
It's not good.

1622
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:56,280
Me thinking she does protest too much would be like, Jesus fucking Christ, stop protesting.

1623
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,880
It's too obvious.

1624
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:58,880
Yeah.

1625
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,960
Now I would say that Alex has been a little bit out of line with talking about this Dominion

1626
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:08,360
employee, but I will say up till this point, he hasn't really been trying to like intimidate

1627
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,040
the guy until now.

1628
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,040
But here's video.

1629
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,040
We know who the guy is.

1630
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,240
We tracked him, Democrat operative.

1631
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,240
We know where he worked.

1632
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:22,960
McDonald's and GameStop before this, we've not released his photo or his name yet, Javier.

1633
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,160
But we have the footage of him in the Key County illegally, whether he knew it or not,

1634
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:29,600
going up with a thumb drive, taking it out.

1635
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:34,320
That's pretty much, that's really fucked up.

1636
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:38,320
That's really fucked up because you could also tell how much Alex kind of relished that

1637
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,200
kind of that moment where he feels like he's threatening somebody.

1638
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,000
Javier, I know you.

1639
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,500
Anytime I can drop it on you.

1640
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,720
But at least there's a lot of Javier's in the world.

1641
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,560
So like at least he didn't say his name.

1642
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:53,600
Palming the USB and waddling out.

1643
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:58,680
And we've got his name, Javier Corey, as we told you.

1644
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:03,360
I wasn't going to break it myself, let Gateway Punden do it.

1645
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,560
Stay in attack formation.

1646
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,560
Oops.

1647
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:09,640
Well, I hope this does not come back to bite you in the ass and you don't get sued.

1648
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,920
I hope it does and he should be sued immediately.

1649
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,040
And even if nothing happens, the judge should look at his other lawsuits and be like, see,

1650
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,040
this is what you're trying to do.

1651
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,040
I know it.

1652
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,040
I can see it in your eyes.

1653
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,040
You're trying to do this.

1654
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,320
This is a clear pattern of behavior.

1655
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1656
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,680
This is the same shit and we're going to stop you before you kill this guy.

1657
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:26,680
Hooray.

1658
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:33,520
Or this kind of behavior happening a couple days ago could be inserted as part of the

1659
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,280
Sandy Hook trial.

1660
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,680
As a piece of information.

1661
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:44,120
Like he is not stopping from behaving in ways that are tailored to raising the possibility

1662
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,360
of harm coming to private citizens.

1663
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,960
I guess I do kind of understand.

1664
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:51,960
He's an asshole.

1665
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:52,960
He's an asshole.

1666
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:59,800
I mean, it shouldn't work like, oh, okay, so you've just told me what the exact line

1667
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:04,500
is, so what I'm going to do is tiptoe up to as close to the line as possible and then

1668
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:08,200
wave my hands at you and be like, nah, nah, you can't catch me.

1669
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,880
I didn't kill this guy this time.

1670
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,720
Your honor, this is completely different because it's about a different thing.

1671
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:14,720
Yeah.

1672
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,360
Same behavior about a different thing.

1673
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,360
Oh, whatever.

1674
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,620
What a fucking asshole.

1675
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:23,380
So now Jordan, I guess there's a lot of pathos at the beginning part and I was kind of bummed

1676
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:27,520
out about it and there was a part of me that felt like, well, this is interesting because

1677
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,720
it is pathetic and there's an interesting glimpse of Alex trying to put on his sort

1678
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:39,080
of Superman jumper and try and play the role of what he thinks he is.

1679
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:42,200
Daddy turned me into a detective, so I found everything.

1680
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,560
And I was like, oh, that's interesting, but that's not great.

1681
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,680
I need more from this episode.

1682
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:53,120
And thankfully another someone who might be a daddy to Alex shows up and that is our boy,

1683
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,120
Steve Pechenik.

1684
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,120
Dr. Steve.

1685
01:15:55,120 --> 01:16:00,240
Let me remind you that a couple of weeks ago and several months ago, I told you that I

1686
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:09,680
was told by my fellow countrymen in cyber command that I was to announce on your show

1687
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:15,760
or when show your show that we had put a QFS watermarks on all the ballots.

1688
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:21,680
We had monitored all the machines on Dominion and we had expected everything to come out

1689
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,640
and it came out of cyber control.

1690
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,120
Where's David Knight at?

1691
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:29,160
I don't have the same factor that you have, but I do respect.

1692
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,160
David, you in the building?

1693
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,160
He's not happy about it.

1694
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,880
I have to imagine.

1695
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:37,320
Yeah, Steve's still on this still on it, huh?

1696
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:43,600
And Alex is still having him on, which is weird because again, this is a direct contradiction

1697
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,360
of literally every other talking point that Alex is spouting.

1698
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:53,280
Now, Steve is not only contradicting Alex in terms of like, no, this was a sting operation

1699
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,160
this entire election.

1700
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:59,160
He also is not thrilled with the idea that Alex is like, Hey, maybe we should have martial

1701
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,160
law.

1702
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:03,400
Steve's like, no, we don't need martial law.

1703
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:09,320
What we have in effect now is we have prepared the sting operation, which I announced here

1704
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,360
on Alex Jones because I was given that permission.

1705
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,040
He's given the permission.

1706
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,040
It's cool.

1707
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:20,120
So yeah, man, I mean, look, OK, I'm never going to be like, hey, I have common cause

1708
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:21,120
with Steve Pachannik.

1709
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,120
Right.

1710
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:27,320
But I do find it comforting on some level that he's not saying we need martial law.

1711
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:32,560
Yeah, but he's also said we should dissolve the government and Melania should be queen.

1712
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:36,160
Yeah, that's why I don't want common cause.

1713
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,960
I would like some clarity coming from Dr. Steve.

1714
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:39,960
All right.

1715
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,560
He's who I go to when I'm looking for sanity in this info world's world.

1716
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,120
When you need a North Star.

1717
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,120
Exactly.

1718
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,120
That's what I'm all about.

1719
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:52,800
Well, unfortunately, Alex decides that this is the time when he's going to be like, yeah,

1720
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:53,800
I don't know.

1721
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,800
Ooh.

1722
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,680
Some people say you're making this up, you're full of it.

1723
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,680
Let me just David Knight.

1724
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:58,680
OK.

1725
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,680
And I think you're a credible person.

1726
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,680
I respect you.

1727
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:01,680
You've been really accurate in the past.

1728
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,320
So that goes a long way for me.

1729
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:06,680
That clip is essentially Alex trying to play both sides of the fence.

1730
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,680
Yeah.

1731
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,880
Now, David says you're full of shit and I still want to talk to you.

1732
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:16,160
So well, I think it's even less that and more just like if anybody in the audience were

1733
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:20,320
to attack him from either side, he can cover his base with a clip like that.

1734
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,320
That's fair.

1735
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,400
He can say that some people say that you're full of it.

1736
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,400
Yeah.

1737
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,040
You're a hard hitting journalist and pushing back on you.

1738
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,400
Then if someone is into Steve's theories, he'll be like, I said that he has a great

1739
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:34,120
track record and that goes a long way with me.

1740
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,120
Yeah.

1741
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,920
He's just being mealy mouthed here.

1742
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:40,920
Anyway, Steve's talking about the situation we find ourselves in.

1743
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:46,520
The ballots are all accounted for and barcodes or whatever the fuck.

1744
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:52,740
And also, some generals have sent troops all over the country and the Supreme Court needs

1745
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:53,740
to be taken out.

1746
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:54,740
OK.

1747
01:18:54,740 --> 01:19:01,880
I can tell you that Nakasone has been running a very effective monitoring system and that

1748
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:06,400
we have deployed military elements all over the country.

1749
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:11,440
I can tell you that in North Florida, the amount of planes that have come in with war

1750
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:18,340
equipment, with a regular army, National Guard and others has increased markedly.

1751
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:25,200
I can tell you that at the same time, John Roberts, the Supreme Court, may have a problem.

1752
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,880
He is a sick man.

1753
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,640
He's had a history of seizures.

1754
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:34,800
We know that his interpretation of corruption is what we call the minimalist quid pro quo

1755
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,800
corruption.

1756
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,800
Yikes.

1757
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,800
Sure.

1758
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,600
That is what we call the minimalist quid pro quo corruption.

1759
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,600
Yeah.

1760
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,600
Yeah.

1761
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:43,600
Cool.

1762
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,600
Cool.

1763
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:48,000
You're talking about sort of, you know, the inefficiency, like A, he's unqualified, the

1764
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,680
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

1765
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:53,680
Meanwhile, we've got General Nakasone coming in and bringing an army into Florida.

1766
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,680
Sure.

1767
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,680
Wow.

1768
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,680
Tomorrow we march on Florida.

1769
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,480
What are you doing?

1770
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:03,080
I never know which of their plans I would be interested in letting play out.

1771
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,080
Not that one.

1772
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,080
Not that one.

1773
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,080
No.

1774
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:11,000
But sometimes they'll have like a, like they, all of their plans are like they have a pwinko

1775
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,040
board and then they just drop something down.

1776
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,040
Caravan.

1777
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,040
Caravan is a plan.

1778
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,040
I'm glad they followed through.

1779
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,040
That's true.

1780
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:21,780
In this episode, I have another one that I fucking hope Alex follows through with.

1781
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:25,240
It will be my next, like Caravanity project.

1782
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:33,080
It will, if Alex does this, I might live stream for days straight of just like, we need updates

1783
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,920
on what's going on with this.

1784
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,240
It's one of the most exciting things.

1785
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,440
You know what?

1786
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:39,440
Fuck it.

1787
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,440
Okay.

1788
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,480
Unprecedented.

1789
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:46,960
If Alex follows through with what he claims he's going to do later in this episode, I

1790
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,320
might join him.

1791
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,320
Okay.

1792
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,320
Okay.

1793
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,320
All right.

1794
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,320
For different reasons.

1795
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,320
All right.

1796
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,320
That's a tease because I don't know what he's going to talk about.

1797
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,320
No, I won't because of fucking COVID.

1798
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,320
Don't worry about it.

1799
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,320
We'll figure it out.

1800
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:58,320
All right.

1801
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,320
Well, we'll talk about this later in the episode.

1802
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,320
We'll get you in a bubble.

1803
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,320
A literal bubble boy situation.

1804
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,900
So earlier you said, by the way, I hate to be a tease.

1805
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:08,240
This will all be revealed within this episode.

1806
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:12,260
Earlier you were mentioning that like the way that Alex was talking about him being

1807
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:16,100
told to do this dominion investigation sounds steveish.

1808
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:21,840
And because steve is still on the, the election was a sting operation.

1809
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:27,080
Why would then the government ask Alex to the left hand?

1810
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,480
Can't know what the right hand's doing.

1811
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,480
Dan.

1812
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:33,400
This is a problem for Alex though, especially in terms of presentation.

1813
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,160
He needs to ask Steve, help me out of this one guy.

1814
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,160
Come on, buddy.

1815
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:43,080
If Congress doesn't stand up, if the electors on December 15th, Dr. Steve, don't say no

1816
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:46,840
to this fraud, then they will put Biden in and Trump says he'll go.

1817
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:50,920
So if there is these watermarks and all this proof, and I believe you talked to those sources

1818
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:51,920
who told you.

1819
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:52,920
So I believe you're in good faith.

1820
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,920
I think you're a good person.

1821
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,400
When do we see the cards on the table?

1822
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,400
What's about to happen?

1823
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:01,400
Like why would the white house see to me, this doesn't mean I'm important.

1824
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:04,240
It means the president's a quadriplegic politically cut off.

1825
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:11,000
Why would they get me to go after a Soros and the chai comms and then we get the smoking

1826
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,440
gun documents, but it takes us two and a half weeks to get it.

1827
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:14,440
Why?

1828
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,760
I mean, if they have this, why?

1829
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,760
Why?

1830
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,120
Because it doesn't make sense.

1831
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,120
It's a great question.

1832
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,480
Why would they do that?

1833
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,120
Some would say it's an unanswerable question.

1834
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:27,360
I would say that it's a very simple, they wouldn't.

1835
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,360
Yep.

1836
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,560
No, but Steve can't say that.

1837
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,680
Oh no, that's a bad idea.

1838
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:35,560
No, because in order for their illusions to continue, that the audience needs to buy into

1839
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,320
to keep the cash flow going.

1840
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,320
Of course.

1841
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:43,560
Steve needs to not be a complete liar and Alex needs to not be shown to have not talked

1842
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:47,400
to the white house about this QAnon post that he's passing off as a scoop.

1843
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,720
Everybody's in a little bit of a dangerous position right now.

1844
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:50,720
Right.

1845
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:54,600
But there is a really smooth way to get out of this pickle and that is...

1846
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:55,600
Leo Zagami.

1847
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:59,720
No, Steve's just got to do exactly what he always does when things get tough.

1848
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:05,160
I appreciate the fact that you're getting very excited, but the reality is the game

1849
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,040
has already been played.

1850
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:14,280
What's happening is that Trump anticipated most of this, Trump actually and the intelligence

1851
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:20,880
community really picked you as the source for which I was to announce what they wanted

1852
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:21,880
me to announce.

1853
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:22,880
Because you're the best.

1854
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:26,200
And I'm not just a certain person or stooge because I don't get paid.

1855
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,480
I'm really not interested in promotion.

1856
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:35,120
I really don't garner anything other than being a citizen warrior.

1857
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,120
Crazy old man.

1858
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:41,280
Chosen as the mainstream media, as opposed to the New York Times, The Post.

1859
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:46,720
So although you're getting excited, what is happening all around you, Alex, is exactly

1860
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,000
what we expected.

1861
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,080
Yeah, so, you know, when you're encountered with this unanswerable question where the

1862
01:23:53,080 --> 01:24:01,000
only logical, rational, real world explanation is you're both crazy liars, you know, you

1863
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,800
get out of that by being like, Alex, calm down.

1864
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,800
You were chosen because you're so great.

1865
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:06,800
You're the best.

1866
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,160
You're the best there ever was, buddy.

1867
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,580
Look at these compliments and don't look at me.

1868
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:14,440
That's a very easy way to get out of the conversation.

1869
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:21,680
And also, you know, then Steve can transition into other topics like Biden will never be

1870
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:22,680
president.

1871
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:23,680
Sure.

1872
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:28,840
I will guarantee you Biden will not become president of the United States because right

1873
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:35,960
now he's wearing possibly an ankle bracelet because he said he has a little bit of problem

1874
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:40,120
on his ankle and he's you know, he's twisted his ankle.

1875
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,560
I don't believe that.

1876
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,620
So you might look at that problem.

1877
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:48,480
So in effect, what you're seeing now, that sounds like cute stuff.

1878
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,480
He's got an ankle bracelet.

1879
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:50,480
I mean, I hope so.

1880
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:54,240
I hope he gets a different type of bracelet.

1881
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:59,120
Look, I can't get excited the way you can, Alex.

1882
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,120
That's the reason why.

1883
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,120
Come on.

1884
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,080
I mean, this is not unusual for me.

1885
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,640
We said it a long time ago.

1886
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,160
Well, I want to believe you.

1887
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:12,120
So in 50 days, I will tell you this, buddy, I am going to I'm just going to if you're

1888
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:14,960
right in 50 days, you are going to be the king of the planet to me.

1889
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,880
I already really like you.

1890
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,280
You got me great info over the years.

1891
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,040
You've been on the show for 19 years.

1892
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,720
It's been really accurate info.

1893
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:23,920
So I just I just hope you're right.

1894
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,200
That is what it sounds like when someone doesn't believe someone.

1895
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,320
Fuck you, Alex.

1896
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,320
Fuck you.

1897
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:31,320
That's not fair.

1898
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,320
Get this dude off your show.

1899
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:40,360
Not just that, but how dare you say that sounds like cute shit 20 minutes after you said cute

1900
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,360
shit.

1901
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,360
A bunch of it.

1902
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,360
You fucking.

1903
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:50,040
You're you're you're being very fast and loose with a private citizen's safety and you're

1904
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:56,760
pitching a nonsensical, stupid voter fraud conspiracy based on QAnon.

1905
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:57,760
Yeah.

1906
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,760
Stuff.

1907
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,760
So you're saying his QAnon bullshit is stupid.

1908
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:01,760
Wow.

1909
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:02,760
That's unfair.

1910
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:03,760
That's just rude.

1911
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:04,760
Well, you got to make it look good.

1912
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:05,760
That's rude.

1913
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,760
Yeah.

1914
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:10,640
Anyway, Steve is a pro.

1915
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,640
That's true.

1916
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:15,280
When Alex says this sounds like QAnon stuff, he's like, hey, man, I can't get excited like

1917
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,280
you get excited.

1918
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,280
I don't know what that means.

1919
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:20,400
But Steve's got to make it like, no, dude, you're so important.

1920
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:21,860
You're so important.

1921
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:26,400
Every time Alex is getting a little bit out of pocket, I think you might be full of shit.

1922
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:27,400
You're a good looking dude.

1923
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,400
I think you're great.

1924
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:29,400
Yeah.

1925
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,400
You know, I was wrong.

1926
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:35,920
I should never have doubted you because of your show and that video that I did with you.

1927
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,000
It was sent to China.

1928
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:44,640
And believe it or not, I got a call from what I call my Chinese nanny, who's been my control

1929
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:48,480
officer in China for the past 30 years.

1930
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:54,520
That meant President Xi and the Public Bureau of Safety in China personally had to call

1931
01:26:54,520 --> 01:27:01,840
me up three weeks ago because of the show that I went on on your show, Alex, to explain

1932
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:07,560
that they are not looking for any trouble to say that it was an excellent show, meaning

1933
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:12,640
that they don't want to get into a problem situation.

1934
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:20,600
Steve went on our info wars and President Xi called and was like, hey man, we don't

1935
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:21,600
want trouble.

1936
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,600
We don't want no trouble.

1937
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,600
Steve.

1938
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,120
I do not know what I'm listening to.

1939
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:29,200
I do not know what's actually happening right now.

1940
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,200
That's absurd.

1941
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:34,960
Alex being like, oh, Trump personally sent me on a message to investigate shit that I

1942
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:39,760
made up and I'm creating this whole fictional mythology around how I'm great.

1943
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:43,720
And then Steve coming with that bullshit at me.

1944
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:44,720
Are we talking?

1945
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:45,720
What am I watching?

1946
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,640
Well, look, I think Steve knows that we exist.

1947
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:53,520
I think he knows that in order to be interesting, he wants to make it on our show.

1948
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:54,520
Exactly.

1949
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,520
He's got to come with it.

1950
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:02,100
If you want to make the after show, your character needs to be interesting, especially if you're

1951
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:03,320
only on for short bursts.

1952
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:07,800
You don't want to be the character who doesn't get a rose, so to speak.

1953
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,840
And Steve, I mean, he has, he gets a rose.

1954
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:16,400
He is also somebody who unfortunately runs the risk of being pretty boring pretty easily

1955
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,200
because he's made so many.

1956
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,200
That's true.

1957
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,200
Deep cuts.

1958
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:23,520
His escalation has to be, yeah, it has to be president.

1959
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:31,520
She called because he wanted to make sure no problems here guys just want to give you

1960
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,520
a call.

1961
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,400
So you got the go ahead and everything's okay.

1962
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:39,020
She wants to parlay Hey guys, we just want you to say stay frosty

1963
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:40,020
out there.

1964
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,020
You keep going.

1965
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:46,280
She wants me to work as an intermediary between Alex Jones and China.

1966
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:51,000
And again, just inexplicable and pointless little bit of racism there.

1967
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Sure.

1968
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:57,200
So Alex is having this interview with Steve and he's, he's also like, I gotta go.

1969
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,200
I gotta leave early.

1970
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:02,920
All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to be playing hooky in the next two hours

1971
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:09,400
when Paul Joseph Watson has Candace Owens, an amazing guest on busy with breaking news

1972
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:16,800
and documents and Intel that I have to go off air and tomorrow we'll have giant breaking

1973
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,240
news here for you on air with the information I'm going to be getting.

1974
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,240
But it's so huge.

1975
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,700
I'm going to have to go off air in about 10 minutes.

1976
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:26,520
It's not, um, there's nothing big going on at all.

1977
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:32,480
I would probably make myself scarce if, um, the, the team up is going to be Paul Joseph

1978
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,600
Watson and Candace Owens.

1979
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:40,440
It's been my feeling that she's not thrilled with being associated with info wars actively.

1980
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:41,440
Right.

1981
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:45,840
Because I think that she thought that there was a bigger space for her, like with turning

1982
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:46,840
point.

1983
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:47,840
Sure.

1984
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:48,840
Sure.

1985
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:49,840
Sure.

1986
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:50,840
Is never coming on info wars.

1987
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:51,840
Right.

1988
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:52,840
Right.

1989
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:53,840
Right.

1990
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:54,840
Right.

1991
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:55,840
I don't know.

1992
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:56,840
I haven't tracked her career as closely, but it seems like she's back in the place where

1993
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:57,840
she would be on info wars.

1994
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:58,840
Yeah.

1995
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:02,280
She thought she could get out into a bigger pond and now she's back in the small pond.

1996
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,840
We'll be with Paul as opposed to be with Alex.

1997
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:07,000
If you're going to do it, go with Paul.

1998
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
It's somehow seems safer for your reputation.

1999
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,280
Um, so Alex is going to leave early cause he's got to pretend to work.

2000
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,280
Yeah.

2001
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,280
Whatever.

2002
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:17,280
Yeah.

2003
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,280
Steve has one going anywhere.

2004
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,240
He has one more big swing to make.

2005
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,240
Okay.

2006
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,240
I love this one.

2007
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,980
I was like, what the fuck?

2008
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:28,800
So I'm telling you, Beijing called me directly because of the show that you're doing right

2009
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:29,800
now.

2010
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:35,880
And we wanted to use you as the main thoroughfare for that announcement.

2011
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:41,280
The last part that you have to know is that ironically, one of my neighbors in Northern

2012
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:47,600
Florida increased the fencing and the size of Gitmo by 200%.

2013
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:56,440
In other words, I have a neighbor who's in charge of wire and fencing for prisons.

2014
01:30:56,440 --> 01:31:05,320
And he went to Gitmo a year ago and increased the size of Gitmo Guantanamo based by over

2015
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,120
a hundred percent.

2016
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,960
Shouldn't you be against that?

2017
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:13,820
Is that, is he trying to say that's because Obama's taller than the other prisoners have

2018
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:15,040
been in the past?

2019
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,600
Is that what we're trying to say?

2020
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:17,600
Yeah.

2021
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:22,560
The globalists that you're going to incarcerate in Guantanamo and your fantasies, the issue

2022
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,040
with them and the safety there is wall size.

2023
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,040
Height.

2024
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,040
Yeah, wall size.

2025
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:29,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2026
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,040
Yeah, this is silly.

2027
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:35,560
But what he's talking about is there were reports of Trump building new construction

2028
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:42,000
at Guantanamo, whereas prior to this, the tendency and the trend had been towards closing

2029
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
it.

2030
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
So I think he's just trying to use some of those ideas, which are super popular in the

2031
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
QAnon world.

2032
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Right, right, right.

2033
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,840
I think Steve is really just like, at this point.

2034
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:50,840
He's just a Q guy.

2035
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:51,840
Yeah.

2036
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:52,840
Yeah.

2037
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:53,840
And so is Alex.

2038
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:54,840
Yep.

2039
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:55,840
Quite frankly.

2040
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,160
Q and the mighty have fallen.

2041
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:58,160
Yeah.

2042
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:01,680
Ah, so like such champions of weirdness becoming followers.

2043
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:02,680
Yeah.

2044
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:03,680
It's sad.

2045
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:12,520
I mean, it is something to be said about Q's ability as a mental disease to infect, I mean,

2046
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:13,920
everybody, you know?

2047
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:14,920
Yeah.

2048
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:17,000
It just gets fucking in your head with these people.

2049
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,960
You're not immune if you're a conspiracy leader.

2050
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:20,960
Yeah.

2051
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:21,960
You can fall.

2052
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:22,960
Yeah.

2053
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:23,960
Well, I mean.

2054
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:29,000
These people who are leaders are smart enough to not say this is what they're into.

2055
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Well, yeah, exactly.

2056
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,200
They know that they can take the ideas and the sort of trends in the conspiracy world

2057
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:42,840
and then reorient them a little bit into being about like, my friend general has told me

2058
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:43,840
the same thing.

2059
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:44,840
Oh, yeah, sure.

2060
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:47,480
Yeah, Q is saying that stuff, but that's just because it's parallel.

2061
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:48,480
It's the same thing.

2062
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,880
I'm just getting it from a real source, whereas, wait.

2063
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:56,560
I imagine that it feels a little bit like stock speculating to be one of these conspiracy

2064
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:02,120
people dealing with Q, trying to be like, okay, well, I think this is one of the theories

2065
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:04,120
that's going to stick.

2066
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:09,480
And if I get on this one, then I'll get more whenever it goes mainstream, whereas.

2067
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:13,920
It may be stock speculating, but it's also, there's no consequences for being wronged.

2068
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,280
Well, yeah, but that's fair.

2069
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,280
People just forget.

2070
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,960
Nobody just loses all their, yeah.

2071
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:23,000
It would be like the stock market if whenever the stock went down, people forgot you bought

2072
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
it.

2073
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,520
Every day, every day, a clean slate.

2074
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,840
So Alex says goodbye to Steve.

2075
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:35,160
And this is not how you part ways with someone who you think is credible.

2076
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:36,160
God bless you.

2077
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:37,160
We'll talk to you soon.

2078
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,160
StevePaschinek.com.

2079
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:39,160
Have a great, have a great week coming up.

2080
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:40,160
You too.

2081
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:41,160
All right.

2082
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:43,160
Man, I hope he's right.

2083
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:46,960
You shouldn't have to hope he's right.

2084
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,280
I have the best guests.

2085
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:53,480
I have the best people and man, I hope that bullshit he just spun makes sense.

2086
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:54,480
Yeah.

2087
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,480
It sounds good.

2088
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:56,480
Probably bullshit.

2089
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,480
Nope.

2090
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:58,480
Bullshit.

2091
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,480
Yeah.

2092
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:04,840
So we jump into the second and Alex starting the show, really just sort of ruminating about

2093
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:09,160
himself as a child and talking about things that are absolutely not true.

2094
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:15,280
When I was six years old, seven years old, I liked to watch PBS Frontline.

2095
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:25,160
I like to watch the long Supreme Court debates, the few that they ever televised.

2096
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:31,440
I really found how things actually work is incredibly interesting.

2097
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:36,320
But then I learned that almost no one else actually wants to study how things work.

2098
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:42,600
When Alex was six years old, he was so advanced, Jordan, you understand that he was watching

2099
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:49,200
full, unedited C-SPAN Supreme Court hearings because he was so fascinated.

2100
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:52,520
But as he got older, he realized no one was as serious as him.

2101
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,780
Let me posit you an alternate theory.

2102
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:59,160
When he found out how hard it was to actually do research, he decided that what he did was

2103
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,520
actual research and what everybody else did was crazy.

2104
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,520
Yeah.

2105
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:08,200
At a certain point, he realized it's really tough to read a book, but to a third person

2106
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:13,160
or to somebody else, to an external observer, there is no difference between you having

2107
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,880
read the book and you saying you read the book.

2108
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:17,320
That sounds true.

2109
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:18,320
Yes.

2110
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:22,660
That is quite a revelation to have at the age of six and I applaud Alex for it.

2111
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:27,240
When I was six years old, I realized that if I put infinite jest on my bookshelf, people

2112
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:28,240
will think I was smart.

2113
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:32,280
I did that myself.

2114
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:36,080
With the same book.

2115
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:43,560
So Alex, god damn it, I was so excited at this point on the second.

2116
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:50,040
I could have, I almost couldn't contain myself because I don't know if you remember this,

2117
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:52,080
but I think it was a 2015 episode.

2118
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:58,560
Alex got on air and he was like, I am going to, in this episode, jump the shark.

2119
01:35:58,560 --> 01:35:59,760
Yes, I do recall that.

2120
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:05,640
I am going to, as a piece of art, performance art, call for the banning of Islam.

2121
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:06,640
Yep.

2122
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:11,360
And then he proceeded to talk himself into not doing it as a performance art.

2123
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:13,360
It's a good idea to ban Islam.

2124
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:19,120
But what he set out to do was like this thing that he was being overly clear about his intentions,

2125
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:24,040
which kind of ruined the sort of satirical thrust of it.

2126
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:29,280
But it was like, I love to see that you had an idea and you wanted to try.

2127
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:30,280
Right.

2128
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:31,920
I got that again.

2129
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:38,200
Certainly, he made our satirical piece work by trying to do a satirical piece and then

2130
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:42,400
winding up embodying the thing that he thought he was satirizing.

2131
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:45,880
Yeah, it was interesting on that level.

2132
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:48,400
And I guess it's the same this time.

2133
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:57,080
Now, I thought about the best way to say this, but I'm just going to get it right out there.

2134
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:02,200
I think it will be more effective to wake you up if I actually join the dark side.

2135
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:04,160
Do it.

2136
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:09,960
I am seriously considering completely shifting into the enemy mindset and presenting all

2137
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:15,200
this and just telling people world government's good and that you should kill yourselves for

2138
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,200
the earth.

2139
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:23,520
I mean, like, I would love it if he did as a joke, just did like a Bill Gates is great

2140
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:29,840
because it would be the most incompetent, nonsensical piece of satire or sort of character

2141
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,280
based nonsense.

2142
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,280
I would love it.

2143
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,640
It would be, it would be a thrill.

2144
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,560
One, it has to be a surprise.

2145
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:38,240
Nobody can know you're about to do it.

2146
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:39,240
Right.

2147
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:40,240
Two, you have to commit to the bit.

2148
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:42,400
You have to open by saying something like that.

2149
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,800
You have to stay solid.

2150
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:47,320
You can't break character and you have to go for a good long while.

2151
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,320
Right.

2152
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,980
So, but I was like, ah, maybe.

2153
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:51,120
And he can't do any of those things.

2154
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:53,520
But he's saying like, ah, I've just been thinking about this.

2155
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:57,880
I got to go to the dark side and be like the globalists.

2156
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:03,360
And then he started to get real fucking dark, like to a point where like you are being what

2157
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,960
I would consider quite to the dark side.

2158
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:12,600
The public cares, good people care, Christians care.

2159
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:19,320
That's the main group that's resisting, but everyone else is running headlong into it

2160
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:25,200
and wanting to be slaves, wanting to be slowly killed, wanting to be made unhappy, wanting

2161
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:32,800
to be failures because they are not meant to go into the future.

2162
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:33,800
They are meant to die.

2163
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:34,800
Wait, what?

2164
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,120
And that's God's plan.

2165
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:37,120
Okay.

2166
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:38,120
Wait.

2167
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,120
So, okay.

2168
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:45,280
So are you telling me that the evil enemy that you hate has come to the conclusion that

2169
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:50,480
humans aren't worth living and has decided to kill all of us and you think that that's

2170
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:51,480
evil.

2171
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:55,640
However, you agree that humans aren't worth living and God is going to kill them all.

2172
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:56,640
Correct?

2173
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,640
Well, yeah.

2174
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:02,320
And he, you know, he's sort of evidence for this that he's basing it on is that it seems

2175
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:09,960
like only Christians are interested in fighting the Christian zealotry war that he's, the

2176
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:12,080
crusade that he's imagining.

2177
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:15,080
It seems odd that this Christian crusade is only backed by Christians.

2178
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:16,080
Right.

2179
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,420
And so that's strange to him.

2180
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:22,320
And it's proof that everyone else is meant to die in God's plan.

2181
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,400
I think that that's really fucked up.

2182
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,400
Yeah.

2183
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:30,080
I think he went from, I think I'm going to join the dark side to, I think I am the dark

2184
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:35,120
side very quickly without seeming to realize that he was doing it.

2185
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:36,120
No.

2186
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:40,560
And that is not him being like performancey and on the dark side because his version of

2187
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:45,880
performance of the dark side to be like, you should put this in your body.

2188
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:50,880
It wouldn't be all non-Christians seem like they're destined for death and that's just

2189
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:51,880
God's plan.

2190
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:52,880
Yeah.

2191
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,280
Isn't he the guy who says that Islam is violent?

2192
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,280
Yes.

2193
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:57,280
Yes.

2194
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,280
I cool.

2195
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:06,080
I do think that at any point, maybe I was being hyperbolic when I said the GOP is ISIS,

2196
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:09,480
but Dan Wolf, this is ISIS.

2197
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:10,480
Yeah.

2198
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:18,280
He's a ways down that road, at least in terms of ideology and thought and hopes.

2199
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:20,320
And let's hope not deeds.

2200
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:27,920
Now this was interesting to me because that's kind of it for this thing that he was intending

2201
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:28,920
to do.

2202
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:29,920
Sure, sure, sure.

2203
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:35,000
He had this great idea of like performatively becoming the dark side and then he immediately

2204
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:42,480
said something incredibly dark and did embody what I would think is coming to a dark side.

2205
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:49,920
But now that he's done with that, Alex tells a story that I think does not make the point

2206
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:52,780
that he wants it to make.

2207
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:57,080
I think that he sounds like an asshole in this story.

2208
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:59,440
They're in fantasy land, they're losers.

2209
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,960
They're not the resistance, they're the establishment.

2210
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:10,400
And they're I mean, I had this guy this weekend, Sunday, I went for a walk down at Zilker Park

2211
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:16,720
and I'm walking along the creek there that dumps in the Colorado River.

2212
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:22,840
And I see this guy, you know, about twenty five, kind of the academic type anti fun.

2213
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:27,120
He's got his, you know, his beard, everything academic and he's wearing a black top black

2214
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:28,120
pants.

2215
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:29,120
But no, no anti stuff I could see.

2216
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:31,920
But I could tell and see I was looking at my looks.

2217
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:35,480
And then he starts walking towards me at an angle like he's going to hit me, he's going

2218
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:36,920
to do something.

2219
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:39,680
And so as he starts coming towards me menacing, I just couldn't help it.

2220
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:43,520
I just instinctively started walking over and I was getting ready to just drive his

2221
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:44,520
ass to the ground.

2222
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:45,520
He was stupid.

2223
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:46,520
I'm taking swing.

2224
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:50,080
It was just instinctive that I started like a magnet coming to him and I was going to

2225
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:53,280
knock his ass down on that ground hard.

2226
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,720
And at the last minute, he kind of went like that and then looked scared.

2227
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:57,860
It's like, yeah, dude, this isn't fantasy world.

2228
01:41:57,860 --> 01:41:58,860
This isn't LARPing.

2229
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:00,760
You're about to get hurt bad.

2230
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:07,480
It sounds like Alex just threatened a guy randomly that he imagined was, wished him

2231
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:10,800
ill and was academic Antifa types.

2232
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,080
This is, this is scary.

2233
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:16,640
So let me see if I can get the details of this story correctly.

2234
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:19,780
And I'm going to do this from the point of a neutral observer.

2235
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:22,080
So I'm in a different angle.

2236
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:23,080
Maybe you're a birdwatcher.

2237
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:25,760
Just hanging out, not doing much.

2238
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:26,760
I see Alex.

2239
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:34,320
I see Alex Jones over there just shaking because he's Alex, uh, just visibly just vibrating.

2240
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:39,320
And then I see a guy over there, uh, probably a little way fish wearing glasses.

2241
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,040
He's got a black shirt on.

2242
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,940
He's got black shorts on Antifa type.

2243
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:50,520
And then he just starts walking away and then, uh, Alex Jones visibly shaking, starts walking

2244
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:54,220
directly towards him and almost throws a fist at him.

2245
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:57,080
And I'm supposed to think, oh, well, it's the Antifa guy's fault.

2246
01:42:57,080 --> 01:43:02,320
Well, at the last minute, the Antifa guy looked like he was about to get hit by somebody.

2247
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:03,320
Yes.

2248
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:10,360
And then all of a sudden he's so subservient, he's so scared of the clear threatening vibe

2249
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:11,360
I was giving off.

2250
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:16,480
I'm going to go with Alex Jones suddenly running towards me on a day where I was just reading

2251
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,480
at the park.

2252
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:18,760
He's going to make me go away.

2253
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:25,120
In that story, I don't hear any clear indication that Alex's violence was in response to any

2254
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:31,160
real violence or threatening-ness of this person who was just on the trail.

2255
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:35,560
And Alex has decided because they're wearing black and have a beard, are academic Antifa.

2256
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:36,560
Right.

2257
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:37,560
Right.

2258
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:38,560
Whatever the fuck that means.

2259
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:39,880
Alex seems like he's a threat to people.

2260
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:46,360
It does seem like what he just said was, if I feel a bad vibe, I will kill someone.

2261
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:49,840
If you're wearing black, you're probably Antifa and I might fucking hit you.

2262
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:52,720
I might just fucking haul off and beat the shit out of you.

2263
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:53,720
Yeah.

2264
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:54,720
Yeah.

2265
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:55,720
Yeah.

2266
01:43:55,720 --> 01:44:00,720
And if you act like it's weird that I'm about to hit you or maybe you duck and cower, then

2267
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:04,160
I'm going to be like, why are you emotionally manipulating me?

2268
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:05,160
Yeah.

2269
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:06,160
Yeah.

2270
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,720
Why are you acting like someone's about to hit you?

2271
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,320
You were about to hit me.

2272
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:10,320
Okay.

2273
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:11,320
Jeez.

2274
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:12,320
Okay.

2275
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,240
Anyway, Alex has a lot of fantasies.

2276
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:17,600
One is the academic Antifa is trying to get them on the trail.

2277
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:23,040
Another is that in the near future, his books, I guess he's written a couple of books sort

2278
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:31,680
of anyway, his show will be contraband and you can record this and you can save this

2279
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:39,000
and in that dystopic future, you won't be able to find it on the cloud or online.

2280
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:44,760
You'll have to have contraband old devices that your smart devices were fused, even allowed

2281
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:45,760
to be plugged in.

2282
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:48,840
You'll have to go through a lot of hoops to even have this saved.

2283
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:52,600
So I would suggest you transcribe it.

2284
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:58,640
And in the future, you'll have to hide it in the near future.

2285
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:03,920
In the near future, I would love it for Alex to like go to Europe and see like a wall sockets

2286
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:08,200
and be like, it's happened already.

2287
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:18,520
Is this AC or DC nothing means anything anymore.

2288
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,320
What a dumb dumb.

2289
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:25,720
Anyway, in this next clip, the only thing I would say about that last thing is just

2290
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:30,760
like, this is just such a desire to be forbidden or whatever.

2291
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:32,560
He's just so into that idea.

2292
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:37,440
I think it's probably from one too many bad sci-fi novels.

2293
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:41,840
So we talk a lot about Alex's bizarre morality.

2294
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:49,440
This idea of sort of galactic rules and stuff.

2295
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:52,360
Mike down for this next clip, because he talks about it a little bit more.

2296
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:57,680
And this is something I really need your help with, because this is another clue about how

2297
01:45:57,680 --> 01:46:02,680
this moral system works, but it doesn't make sense.

2298
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:04,840
You're not injected with one microchip.

2299
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:12,080
You're injected with hundreds of little tiny ones that all have the same amount of data

2300
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:17,080
on them that a chip 10 years ago had.

2301
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:19,960
And you're saying, well, why don't they just spray it out of helicopters or out of planes?

2302
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:22,840
Then we ingest it and breathe it.

2303
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:29,720
Metaphysically, they're not allowed to do that historically.

2304
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:31,880
They have to get you under pressure to do it.

2305
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:34,620
They've got to leave a way out for you on a skate patch.

2306
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:37,680
But they need to force you to do it.

2307
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:39,040
It's a push.

2308
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:45,480
But then it becomes a shove once God removes the barrier hedge.

2309
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:50,000
And then, yes, they will put it in your water, put it in your food, put it everywhere.

2310
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:58,120
So God has a barrier hedge to this sort of free will thing.

2311
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:03,980
The devil, once God says, eh, go ahead, then the devil can go ahead and just mess with

2312
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:05,160
your free will.

2313
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:10,920
And that's why there's chemtrails, I guess, because God is like, yeah, that hedge is gone.

2314
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:11,920
Fuck it.

2315
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:12,920
Who cares?

2316
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:13,920
Yeah.

2317
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:14,920
I think if I understand what he's saying—

2318
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:16,600
Because Alex does believe in chemtrails.

2319
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:17,600
Yes, he does.

2320
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:18,600
Yes.

2321
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:19,600
Yes.

2322
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:20,600
But you can't spray things randomly.

2323
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,600
No, no, no.

2324
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:22,600
Targeted.

2325
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:24,080
God removed that hedge already.

2326
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,200
Right, right, right, right.

2327
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:31,380
So I think, if I understand correctly, I think what he's saying is that the devil, the literal

2328
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:37,120
Christian devil, which is real and is running Biden's campaign still somehow, it can't—

2329
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:38,120
And might have called Steve.

2330
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:40,120
Yes, and might have called Steve.

2331
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:42,120
China called, and so did the devil.

2332
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:43,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2333
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:44,120
Both.

2334
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:45,120
Steve got two phone calls.

2335
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,480
Oh, the devil said he wasn't doing well.

2336
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:51,080
So he can push you, right?

2337
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:57,280
And God will stop him from going too far unless you've given a little bit of like a, hey,

2338
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:01,960
maybe I'll go along with the devil, and then God will remove that final ring of protection,

2339
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:04,000
and then you will be thrown into the abyss.

2340
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,920
I don't think that's what he's saying.

2341
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:14,080
I think that—I don't know if—I don't—I'm not certain, based on the things that I've

2342
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:18,240
heard, that this hedge of protection that God has—

2343
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:19,240
Sure.

2344
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:24,820
I'm not certain that that is, like, relies on your choice.

2345
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:31,600
It has to, because you have to have the way out, and you have to be able to—so you have

2346
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:32,600
to choose the devil.

2347
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:34,200
But how do chemtrails work, then?

2348
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,680
Well, you chose to look up.

2349
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:39,000
But it doesn't matter if I look up.

2350
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,720
According to them, you're breathing in all these, like, these aluminums and whatever

2351
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:46,080
the fuck in the air.

2352
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:47,640
That is something that you can't escape.

2353
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:55,520
You did not make any choice that—that is something that is completely above your will.

2354
01:48:55,520 --> 01:49:00,040
You did not agree to that, therefore it's an infringement of your will.

2355
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:03,120
Right, but it hasn't been primed yet.

2356
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:06,280
It's just like a bomb without a timer, you know?

2357
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:10,000
You've just got all the stuff in you, and then you have to believe something, and then

2358
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
they'll activate it.

2359
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
No.

2360
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,000
No.

2361
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I can't imagine that.

2362
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
I'm struggling.

2363
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,120
This makes less than zero sense.

2364
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:18,720
Yeah, I don't understand this new wrinkle to it.

2365
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,720
Yeah, I don't like it.

2366
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:21,520
But there's another wrinkle, and that is—

2367
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:22,520
So soon?

2368
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:23,520
Yes.

2369
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:24,520
Oh, God.

2370
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,160
And that is that you can't do things to kids.

2371
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:29,840
But I think from the context of this, Alex is talking about vaccines.

2372
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:30,840
Yes.

2373
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:36,160
Now, the real ultimate sin here is, though, they target children before they are of age

2374
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:38,800
to make the discernment.

2375
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:45,960
And so that's why the Satanists are so cursed, is they cheat and they lie to themselves.

2376
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:46,960
Why can they cheat then?

2377
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:51,960
And they break the metaphysical rule that they are not allowed to hurt innocents.

2378
01:49:51,960 --> 01:50:01,720
They're only allowed to get adults to not support themselves and to make a bad decision

2379
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:06,320
to receive the spiritual interdimensional transmission from Satan.

2380
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:07,320
So it's real simple.

2381
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:08,320
They're tuned into the security channel.

2382
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,320
It's real simple!

2383
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:10,320
They like it.

2384
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:11,320
They like it.

2385
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:12,320
It's real simple!

2386
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:13,320
They like the Satan channel.

2387
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:17,360
I want to be a ruler and I want somebody to slap his hands whenever he's like, they can

2388
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:18,360
cheat.

2389
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:19,360
Mm-hmm.

2390
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:20,360
No.

2391
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:21,360
You said they can't cheat.

2392
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:22,360
But that's why they're cursed.

2393
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:23,360
Yeah, but you said they can't cheat.

2394
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,360
Well—

2395
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:28,760
I mean, if they're already cursed, then why wouldn't you just continue cheating?

2396
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:33,040
There's no greater punishment after hell, right?

2397
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,040
Right.

2398
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:37,280
So if you've already cheated, why would you then be like, well, we still have to follow

2399
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:38,280
the rules of chemtrail?

2400
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:40,040
If you cheat, you're cursed, but you're not going to hell.

2401
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:41,040
You're cursed.

2402
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:42,040
What?

2403
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:43,040
Oh.

2404
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:45,360
Well, I guess I retract all of my arguments.

2405
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:48,680
That makes you smile weird, and Alex can pick you out of a crowd.

2406
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:49,680
That's fair.

2407
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:50,680
Those are the problems with being cursed.

2408
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:52,200
Alright, you can't be a daywalker anymore.

2409
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:53,200
I gotcha.

2410
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:58,480
Because I think what he's saying is that they're getting around the cosmic rules, because these

2411
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:04,780
children are agreeing to get vaccinated, but they don't know any better.

2412
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:05,780
So it's like—

2413
01:51:05,780 --> 01:51:10,560
Who's making cosmic rules with loopholes that big?

2414
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:11,560
I don't know.

2415
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:13,440
There's only one person.

2416
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:18,880
Also, I would suggest that if this is some kind of thing that really curses you, having

2417
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:24,040
children make decisions that they're unable to understand, what about baptism?

2418
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:25,040
What about child baptism?

2419
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:26,520
Shouldn't that be a problem for them?

2420
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:27,520
No, no, no.

2421
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,840
Because the children can choose that, and that's good.

2422
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:34,760
But, I mean, I understand that subjectively you would say that that is a good decision

2423
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:37,840
as opposed to getting a vaccine, which you think is a bad decision, which you're being

2424
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:38,840
tricked into.

2425
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:39,840
Right.

2426
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:44,760
But externally, from the view of the universe, these are both things that this child cannot

2427
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:45,760
decide.

2428
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:47,120
No, you can't trick a kid towards God.

2429
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:48,760
That's the other cosmic rule.

2430
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:52,240
You can only go towards—if you get baptized, you've meant to.

2431
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:53,240
Right.

2432
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:54,240
It just seems weird.

2433
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:55,240
Yeah.

2434
01:51:55,240 --> 01:52:00,100
I just don't understand what it is exactly that makes those acts different outside of

2435
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:01,100
wanting them to be different.

2436
01:52:01,100 --> 01:52:06,280
See, I just don't understand why you would want to be involved in any of that.

2437
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:07,280
Like I don't want—

2438
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:08,280
This morality?

2439
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:09,280
Yeah!

2440
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:12,680
I don't want to be—I don't want to be good in this morality.

2441
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:18,220
This seems even more—being good seems even more somehow evil in his morality.

2442
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:19,880
And it's all incredibly confusing.

2443
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:20,880
In coherence!

2444
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:21,880
How can you live on a day-to-day—

2445
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:22,880
From day to day.

2446
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:23,880
Yeah, right?

2447
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:24,880
It's like, I don't know.

2448
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:25,880
I might be the devil.

2449
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:26,880
I don't know.

2450
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:32,160
How do you make small moral choices like, hmm, should I tell my wife she looks pretty

2451
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:35,360
today or do I have to be 100% honest?

2452
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:39,640
Is me telling her she looks pretty going to take away her free will to dress herself as

2453
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:40,640
she so chooses?

2454
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:41,640
Exactly!

2455
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:42,640
Am I the devil?

2456
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:43,640
Oh, man.

2457
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:44,640
Yeah.

2458
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:45,640
Woof.

2459
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:46,640
Yeah, there's almost—it's paralyzing.

2460
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:47,640
Yeah.

2461
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:48,640
Yeah, that's terrifying.

2462
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,640
Yeah.

2463
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:52,940
But, look, anyway, the devil, he has weird rules.

2464
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:53,940
The devil's followers—

2465
01:52:53,940 --> 01:52:54,940
So does God.

2466
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:55,940
—are cursed.

2467
01:52:55,940 --> 01:52:56,940
Yeah.

2468
01:52:56,940 --> 01:52:57,940
But hey, man—

2469
01:52:57,940 --> 01:52:58,940
So are God's.

2470
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:01,440
But we've gotten to where we've gotten, right?

2471
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:05,240
And the more you—you just gotta resist.

2472
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:12,880
And the enemy's biggest leg up is that what they're doing is so focused, so diabolical,

2473
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:23,400
so over-the-top that people just have real trouble grasping it, and they project their

2474
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:28,320
own mindset onto the establishment.

2475
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,800
And people don't want to face this.

2476
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:32,040
People don't want to know the big truth.

2477
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:37,320
They think that they can just deny it, and it's like a problem that's gonna go away.

2478
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:44,480
It's a foul.

2479
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:50,520
And so the more you resist, the quicker this is gonna be over with.

2480
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:54,440
We're still gonna go through the fire.

2481
01:53:54,440 --> 01:54:02,220
But acquiescing to what's coming is going to destroy you.

2482
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:08,040
So when I hear that, I hear something along the lines of like, you know, hey, let's all

2483
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:09,040
burn.

2484
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:10,040
Yeah.

2485
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:12,800
The more you fight, the better it'll be.

2486
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:15,280
So why not join an insurgency of some sort?

2487
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:18,920
If I don't get what I want, everyone's going to die.

2488
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:19,920
Yeah.

2489
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:20,920
Yeah.

2490
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:21,920
I mean, the fire.

2491
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:22,920
I—

2492
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:25,080
It's a cleansing fire, as Alex has referred to it.

2493
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:27,840
I want to throw a flag.

2494
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:32,560
I want there to be a ten-yard penalty for him being like, people project onto the establishment

2495
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:35,680
because things are too difficult for them to understand, and then they want to live

2496
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:36,680
in denial.

2497
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:39,120
I want to throw a flag on that.

2498
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:40,280
You can't say it.

2499
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:41,280
Yeah.

2500
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:44,600
So Alex veers off from this path of like, fire.

2501
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:46,120
We'll all live through the fire.

2502
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:47,120
Fire will come.

2503
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:53,040
He wants to hit on some of his sort of modern talking points, some of these villains.

2504
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:57,080
All these articles about looking forward to the end of humanity, and Klaus Schwab is like,

2505
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:59,060
it's going to be so good for you.

2506
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:01,920
You are going to drink sewage.

2507
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:02,920
These are actual quotes.

2508
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:10,640
You are going to drink sewage and eat weeds, and there will not be any more people in it.

2509
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:16,720
It's good for Earth, and again, you will be drinking this sewage.

2510
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:18,520
He's saying this in German, by the way.

2511
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:20,800
He only lives in German.

2512
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:21,800
With a Russian accent, of course.

2513
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:24,840
Most of his speeches are in other languages, but you can read the transcripts, it's in

2514
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:25,840
the news today.

2515
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:26,840
I'm not kidding.

2516
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:31,420
So I think that's one of those things that's really easy to see through, like what he's

2517
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:33,360
lying about.

2518
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:34,360
These are direct quotes.

2519
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:37,480
Well, I mean, it's like, yeah, okay.

2520
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:39,520
I will feed you dog turds.

2521
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:40,640
This is what you will do.

2522
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:42,000
These are actual quotes, by the way.

2523
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Without-

2524
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,760
I am telling you, I am in Germany, by the way.

2525
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:46,800
I am a German man.

2526
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:52,880
Without even doing any looking into any of this, it would be so easy for someone to be

2527
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:58,480
like, oh yeah, he's talking about sewage treatment plants, turning that into potable water, and

2528
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:03,080
the potential of weeds as being a cultivatable food source.

2529
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:08,320
Think of turning things that we usually think of as not good into things that are good.

2530
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,320
That's called progress.

2531
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:14,000
Right, and weeds are things that grow without any human intervention.

2532
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,680
If there were a way that you could turn that into food source, it would be amazing.

2533
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:20,100
It would be something that would be really great.

2534
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:23,600
Renewable water is something that will be increasingly important in the future.

2535
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:26,780
Imagine if food was an invasive species, just food.

2536
01:56:26,780 --> 01:56:30,920
It's not like Klaus Schwab is coming in and being like, eat this dandelion and this cup

2537
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:31,920
of piss.

2538
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:35,200
I shall feed you all manner of poop.

2539
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:38,400
Yeah, so silly.

2540
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:42,040
Anyway, Alex is very serious.

2541
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:43,040
Yes.

2542
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:48,920
You're talking about foreign language speeches that Klaus Schwab gives, and his next subject

2543
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:50,400
is just as serious.

2544
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:53,640
I've already burned through this segment, I haven't got any of the clips I want to get

2545
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:54,640
to.

2546
01:56:54,640 --> 01:57:00,720
We'll cover all the election fraud and that nightmare and where that's going next hour.

2547
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:04,880
But everybody's flipping out about this video that's up on Infowars.com.

2548
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:05,880
Flipping out.

2549
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:08,360
From last night, we should probably repost the article.

2550
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:16,000
But a COVID prediction from Project Runway in March of last year.

2551
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:25,760
So a full 10, 11 months before it was even named that or on the radar.

2552
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:33,760
But again, where do the globalists like to put stuff in fashion and in movies and in

2553
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:34,760
culture?

2554
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:40,960
I'm going to tell you, like some serial killers will do that.

2555
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:45,480
This is so dumb.

2556
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:46,480
You know what?

2557
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:51,480
My instinct whenever somebody's like, uh, Project Runway predicts something in March

2558
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:54,280
of last year is just to go, nah, get the fuck out of here.

2559
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:57,880
But when it gets paid off with where do the globalists put things?

2560
01:57:57,880 --> 01:57:58,880
Fashion shows.

2561
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:00,320
It's in Project Runway.

2562
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:03,000
That's where they hide all of their secrets, Dan.

2563
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Yeah.

2564
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:10,320
Bob comes up with an evil plan to make people eat sewage and then Tim Gunn says, make it

2565
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,320
happen.

2566
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:13,320
I think that's his catchphrase.

2567
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:14,320
I can't remember.

2568
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:15,320
Pretty sure.

2569
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:16,320
Make it work.

2570
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,320
Make it work.

2571
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:18,320
That sounds right.

2572
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:19,320
I think that's what it is.

2573
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:20,320
I have not seen that show in a very long time.

2574
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:25,720
But an ex of mine from years past loved that and I watched a fuck ton of that show.

2575
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:27,120
Is that where you first heard about COVID?

2576
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:28,120
What?

2577
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:29,120
No, I didn't watch that season.

2578
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,120
Oh, okay.

2579
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:31,120
I looked into this though.

2580
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:33,160
Of course you looked into it.

2581
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:40,400
But there was a contestant whose name was COVID with a K, which is a Sanskrit word.

2582
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:42,160
I'm already off the train.

2583
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:45,280
And so there was a challenge called the head to toe challenge.

2584
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:48,920
We had to make an outfit that involved the head to the feet.

2585
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:49,920
An entire outfit.

2586
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:50,920
All right.

2587
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:52,680
So it's a guy named COVID creating a bodysuit.

2588
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:56,240
Well, no, but the outfit involved a mask.

2589
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:58,600
And so like COVID made a mask.

2590
01:58:58,600 --> 01:58:59,600
Yes.

2591
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:00,600
Yeah.

2592
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:01,600
I got it.

2593
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:02,600
It's a fucking game show.

2594
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:03,600
It is.

2595
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:04,600
It's great.

2596
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:05,600
We all have a great time.

2597
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:06,600
It's a game show.

2598
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:09,800
And if you wanted to take a really easy route, you could maybe make a hat, but the mask is

2599
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:14,440
something that may be a little bit more adventurous, maybe a little more difficult to pull off

2600
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:15,440
as an outfit.

2601
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:19,020
And it just so happened that the person's name was COVID with a K, which is not the

2602
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:20,020
same word.

2603
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:21,020
Who cares?

2604
01:59:21,020 --> 01:59:25,780
Are you sure the globalist didn't plant a person named COVID to make a mask in order

2605
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:31,520
to give us the cosmic realization that eventually a pandemic would be coming named COVID and

2606
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:40,280
they will be using masks in order to turn us into their own models on project no fun

2607
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:41,280
way.

2608
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:44,320
Really, quite frankly, the laugh they're having is huge.

2609
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:45,320
It's very large.

2610
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:46,320
Yeah.

2611
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:47,320
But you know what's also really interesting?

2612
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:49,200
If it's anything like mine, it's very big.

2613
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:54,800
You know what also is really interesting is they couldn't laugh unless Alex found out.

2614
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:58,280
Like unless Alex reported on this, the globalists couldn't laugh about this.

2615
01:59:58,280 --> 01:59:59,280
It's a real bummer.

2616
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:00,280
Yeah.

2617
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:02,040
I don't think that's too subtle for anyone to get.

2618
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:03,040
Yeah.

2619
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,040
Oh, they need Alex.

2620
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:05,040
Yeah.

2621
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,520
They're in a terrible dance of death.

2622
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:07,520
But Alex doesn't need them.

2623
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:08,520
I really think he does.

2624
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:09,520
They're demons.

2625
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:10,520
They're vampires.

2626
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:11,520
But he's a demon.

2627
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,520
Well, but they're vampires.

2628
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:13,520
Okay.

2629
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:14,520
Well, that's true.

2630
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:18,760
By the way, you know, there's paintings of Count Dracula, spitting image of Prince Charles.

2631
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:23,680
So see, I could say a lot, I could do a lot here, but just you need to understand what

2632
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:24,680
you're-

2633
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:33,480
Blood drinking, child killing, pedophile murderers.

2634
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:43,560
So you can either fight them or you can roll over and die to them.

2635
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:44,560
Like Count Dracula.

2636
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:49,880
But he wants to put his genetics into your blood.

2637
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:52,420
He wants to defile you.

2638
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:58,540
He wants to put his material into your cells and overwrite your cell, cell by cell.

2639
02:00:58,540 --> 02:01:04,720
It's not a flying saucer crashed out in Antarctica in the movie The Thing.

2640
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:05,720
There are paintings of The Thing as well.

2641
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:08,600
It's coming out of a Chinese laboratory.

2642
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:11,140
No paintings.

2643
02:01:11,140 --> 02:01:17,120
It's not the movie The Hunger where they look under the microscope and they see the vampire

2644
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:19,280
cell taking over the other cell.

2645
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:20,280
I didn't see that one.

2646
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:21,640
I'll have to check it out.

2647
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:23,760
It's not a David Bowie movie.

2648
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:25,040
Excellent film, by the way.

2649
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:26,400
Which David Bowie movie?

2650
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:30,760
It's the real world, boys and girls.

2651
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:35,480
I want to hit two things here in a moment, but let me just do this.

2652
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:37,040
I need money to fight this war.

2653
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:38,040
Cool.

2654
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:39,040
Love it.

2655
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:40,040
Love it.

2656
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:41,040
Love it.

2657
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:44,600
I need money to fight these vampires.

2658
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:48,520
Honestly, wooden stakes are expensive as hell.

2659
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:53,760
And you should see the fucking garlic bills at Info War Studio.

2660
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:58,720
You know, that's something that most vampire movies that have stuck with the old ways.

2661
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,000
It's very cost effective.

2662
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,720
You can find cheap stake material just about anywhere.

2663
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:07,480
The later Blade movies where you have to have high tech stuff and the underworld movies

2664
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:08,840
where you have to do all that stuff.

2665
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:12,560
But even then, still, stays the same, basically.

2666
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:14,240
Put a stake through its heart.

2667
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:16,960
Sunlight, steak, garlic.

2668
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:18,480
Garlic keeps them away.

2669
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:19,480
Yeah.

2670
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:20,480
I have a little garlic garlic.

2671
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:21,480
You got a little garlic.

2672
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:22,480
That's why we're...

2673
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:23,480
Our studio's totally safe from vampires.

2674
02:02:23,480 --> 02:02:24,480
Totally vampire free.

2675
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:25,480
Yeah.

2676
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:29,440
I'm not scared of these things that Alex is really worried about, because I have some

2677
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:30,440
garlic around.

2678
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:31,440
I have garlic.

2679
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:32,440
I've got wood.

2680
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:33,440
We're good to go.

2681
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:34,440
Yep.

2682
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:36,240
And I have a not black cat.

2683
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:37,240
That's true.

2684
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:38,240
So...

2685
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:40,240
Although Celine could be a vampire.

2686
02:02:40,240 --> 02:02:41,240
Yeah, probably.

2687
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:42,240
She's drawn some blood.

2688
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:44,720
She lost her eye to... could be a vampire fight.

2689
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:46,480
Or she could have been fighting a lycanthrope.

2690
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:54,840
Anyway, Alex, he ended that last clip with a plug, because of course he did.

2691
02:02:54,840 --> 02:03:02,560
And this leads to him doing a long plug, an ad, and also a convoluted story about why

2692
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:06,080
he's not selling super blue anymore.

2693
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:09,920
Eagle-eared listeners will remember that the reason is because he got a cease and desist

2694
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:13,000
letter from the Attorney General of New York.

2695
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
There's more to it than that.

2696
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,680
Oh, there certainly is.

2697
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:19,480
We have the charcoal toothpaste that's super high quality and concentrated.

2698
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:20,480
That is amazing.

2699
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:21,480
Turned your mouth black.

2700
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:24,520
We had it in the pipeline for about a year and a half before we even started selling.

2701
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:28,880
People said, well, will you stop selling your super blue and your whitening toothpaste?

2702
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:33,280
Yeah, because the national media lied and said that I said it was a COVID cure and tried

2703
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:36,280
to get me arrested.

2704
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:39,000
And still trying, but after this and everything.

2705
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:44,280
And the problem is if I sell it, they'll lie again and say, he's selling a cure.

2706
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:47,960
And all these people flooded to buy it thinking it's a cure because they're saying it's cure.

2707
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:52,560
Then they try to get affidavits from them thinking they bought a cure to indict me.

2708
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:54,400
That's why we don't have that available for you.

2709
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:57,920
Because of the criminal activity of the Democratic Party and Leticia James in New York.

2710
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:02,720
I mean, these are savage mafia dons that murder old people in nursing homes on purpose.

2711
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:04,840
I mean, I'm up against murderers.

2712
02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:11,840
I feel like if everybody's lying about how you're selling this stuff, that's not a reason

2713
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:12,840
to stop.

2714
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:14,960
They just don't do the things that they're saying.

2715
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:19,960
Well, if you're not doing those things, then just keep selling the product.

2716
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:22,520
If you have nothing to fear, then you have nothing to fear.

2717
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:23,920
Like I don't give a shit.

2718
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:30,960
There's no affidavit that someone could file that would say, I was under the impression

2719
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:33,880
that this would stop me from getting COVID-19.

2720
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:39,800
If you didn't do anything to make them think that, that affidavit would fail in court.

2721
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:45,760
Then those affidavits directly quote you as having said something, and then they go and

2722
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:48,420
they look and you said that stuff.

2723
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:49,840
That's the reason to stop selling the stuff.

2724
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:50,840
That's when you stop selling.

2725
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:51,840
Yeah, yeah.

2726
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,720
You wouldn't keep doing it if there was no problem.

2727
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:54,720
Weird.

2728
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:55,720
That's a problem, yeah.

2729
02:04:55,720 --> 02:05:01,780
So Alex doesn't mention this specifically on the episode, but Project Veritas has a

2730
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:04,760
new little thing going on.

2731
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:06,360
I didn't watch it because I don't care.

2732
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:07,360
Don't care.

2733
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:08,360
Fuck them.

2734
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:09,360
Yeah.

2735
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:18,480
Unfortunately, James O'Keefe may have gotten on a CNN morning editorial call and live streamed

2736
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:19,480
it.

2737
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:22,560
So he's like, yeah, Jeff Zucker coming for you.

2738
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:26,320
We can get into the places where you think you're private and like...

2739
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:28,840
And they're all like...

2740
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:29,840
We have lawyers.

2741
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:32,040
Could you not be here or we'll sue you?

2742
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:33,160
I don't know what to tell you.

2743
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:34,160
Get out!

2744
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:37,040
I hope that doesn't blow up in James O'Keefe's face at all.

2745
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:38,040
Really do.

2746
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:39,040
Again, being facetious.

2747
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:40,040
Get him.

2748
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:41,040
Get him.

2749
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:45,440
Alex doesn't mention this stuff, but he does have a weird out of nowhere obsession with

2750
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:46,440
Jeff Zucker.

2751
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:47,440
Odd.

2752
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:48,440
Which seems to be related.

2753
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:49,440
Yeah.

2754
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,600
Look at the photo of Jeff Zucker.

2755
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:53,040
Looks just like Brian Stelter.

2756
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:54,280
The little...

2757
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:56,320
He's so in love with himself.

2758
02:05:56,320 --> 02:05:57,960
Just oh, he's so satisfied.

2759
02:05:57,960 --> 02:06:03,640
Oh, they drive him in a limo and oh, he makes millions of dollars and oh, he's Jeff Zucker.

2760
02:06:03,640 --> 02:06:04,640
He's a joke.

2761
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:11,600
And by the way, he knows he's a joke.

2762
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:13,780
A smug nobody.

2763
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:15,880
And that's why he wants to bring you down.

2764
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:19,520
He hates you when you have a good Christmas.

2765
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:20,520
He hates...

2766
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:23,520
He hates you when you pray to God.

2767
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:26,800
He hates you because you've got a wonderful wife and children.

2768
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:34,240
He will never be a good person because he is a filthy, degenerate sack of evil.

2769
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:36,800
That's a little much.

2770
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,800
Little much.

2771
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:46,900
I can't say that that was intended to be antisemitic, but holy shit, is that trafficking and antisemitism.

2772
02:06:46,900 --> 02:06:50,680
That's dripping in classical.

2773
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:52,320
He hates you when you have a good Christmas.

2774
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:57,160
He hates you when you have a good Christmas.

2775
02:06:57,160 --> 02:07:01,400
He loves it when you have a good birthday, but he hates it when you have a good Christmas.

2776
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:02,400
So ridiculous.

2777
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,360
Very neutral on Arbor Day.

2778
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:05,360
I don't know.

2779
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:09,120
I mean, I know that Jeff Zucker is somebody that Alex has brought up in the past.

2780
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:13,940
He's not somebody who's a complete stranger to Alex's world, but he's definitely not someone

2781
02:07:13,940 --> 02:07:15,240
who's front and center for Alex.

2782
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:17,760
No, he's right-wing du jour, if you will.

2783
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:21,620
Yeah, but the focus is very glaring.

2784
02:07:21,620 --> 02:07:25,520
It's very apparent that like, oh, I'm going to try and catch some of the weak.

2785
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:26,920
That's what I'm saying.

2786
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:28,800
He's today's boogeyman.

2787
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:34,040
But, I think that even Alex recognizes that James O'Keefe's stuff is best to stay away

2788
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:35,040
from.

2789
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:36,040
He didn't reference it this time.

2790
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:40,280
Yeah, and he's not having James on, which he has all of these other times.

2791
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:41,600
I think he's like, ugh.

2792
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:42,880
This one might be too much.

2793
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:46,480
I don't even know if it's like, consequences, it just might be like, I don't know, this

2794
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:47,480
is a little soft.

2795
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:48,480
That's fair.

2796
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:50,960
Best to stay away, but let's kick Jeff Zucker.

2797
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:52,240
Well, why not?

2798
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:53,240
Yeah.

2799
02:07:53,240 --> 02:07:58,880
Alex thinks that the best way for Trump to remain president is to just do it.

2800
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:03,600
I don't think Trump should even punt to the electors and the legislatures.

2801
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:08,880
I think he should go with the American people, resolute desk, show all this evidence, and

2802
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:12,960
say, stand with me, American people, say no to this.

2803
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:15,340
I know I'm going to D.C. on the 12th.

2804
02:08:15,340 --> 02:08:19,100
I know I'm going to that event, and by the way, I'm taking that big march over.

2805
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:20,520
We started it before.

2806
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:21,980
These women hijacked it.

2807
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:22,980
Now they're saying it again.

2808
02:08:22,980 --> 02:08:25,800
You can't even hear them on their microphone when 500,000 are there.

2809
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:26,800
I'll be there.

2810
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:27,800
We'll march to the White House.

2811
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:28,800
It's going to be great.

2812
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:29,800
I'll see you there.

2813
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:30,800
There weren't 500,000 people there.

2814
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:32,920
Also, you co-opted their event.

2815
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:33,920
Yeah.

2816
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:34,920
They had the permit.

2817
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:35,920
They were there.

2818
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:36,920
They organized the event.

2819
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:37,920
They did all the work.

2820
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:38,920
Yeah, you might have brought some people.

2821
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:39,920
You drove there.

2822
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:40,920
Good for you.

2823
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:41,920
Good for you.

2824
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:42,920
Attracting a crowd.

2825
02:08:42,920 --> 02:08:46,560
You still stole their event, and you're going to do that again and pretend that they're

2826
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:50,360
stealing your event when they organized it and have the permits.

2827
02:08:50,360 --> 02:08:51,360
Holy shit.

2828
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:59,280
So yeah, I think that Alex is on his way to another Tea Party, and I think it's interesting

2829
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:01,560
that we know his trends.

2830
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:03,780
We know his patterns of behavior.

2831
02:09:03,780 --> 02:09:08,080
We know what he did with the Tea Party, more or less, claiming that they were co-opting

2832
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:10,660
his movement and what have you.

2833
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:16,980
And I think you can see it happening a little bit again, on a smaller scale, at least at

2834
02:09:16,980 --> 02:09:23,360
this point, because the people who are having these rallies in DC are just sort of remnants

2835
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:24,840
of Tea Party people.

2836
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:27,920
They just don't dress up as fun anymore.

2837
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:34,120
Yeah, now we're at a point where Alex is probably more hooked up with the fringe and the sizable

2838
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:35,120
crowds.

2839
02:09:35,120 --> 02:09:36,120
True.

2840
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:37,120
True.

2841
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:41,040
So he might actually be able to co-op them far more successfully than his attempts to

2842
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:46,600
take over Glenn Beck's shit, when Glenn Beck was on TV and Alex was the voice in the woods.

2843
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:54,360
But, I think one of the parts of what Alex, you know, his credibility now is he's best

2844
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:56,740
friends with Roger Stone.

2845
02:09:56,740 --> 02:10:03,040
And just like we had Steve come in on December 1st, now we have Steve.

2846
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:05,080
Now we have different Steve.

2847
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:06,080
Other Steve.

2848
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:07,080
Yes.

2849
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:10,000
You'll understand why that slip of the tongue happened, because Roger's swinging.

2850
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Okay, good.

2851
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,560
But, and for the fences, I don't mean like a Liberty.

2852
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:14,560
No, no, no, no.

2853
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:15,560
He's going for it.

2854
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:21,320
Um, the first clip is the bad kind of a swing and that is, uh, Hey man, yeah, fucking martial

2855
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:22,320
law.

2856
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:23,320
Cool.

2857
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:24,320
Great.

2858
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:27,960
Uh, and I think the president has to have all options on the table as to how he proceeds.

2859
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:31,780
The one thing he cannot do, Alex, is quit.

2860
02:10:31,780 --> 02:10:35,880
He has powerful forces arrayed against him.

2861
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:38,960
Uh, it is, uh, it is extraordinary.

2862
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:43,120
Let's call them the armies of the Pharaoh, the Pharaoh's armies.

2863
02:10:43,120 --> 02:10:45,960
Uh, but this is God's nation.

2864
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:49,560
I believe he was selected for God for this job.

2865
02:10:49,560 --> 02:10:55,760
I pray to God every day that he will not, uh, not only not quit, but he will be strengthened

2866
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:56,760
in his resolve.

2867
02:10:56,760 --> 02:10:57,760
Yeah.

2868
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:58,760
Go tell Nixon about it.

2869
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:01,100
Oh boy.

2870
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:05,920
I just love the idea of like, Hey Roger, uh, like in, you know, like the seventies and

2871
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:07,800
go back there and be like, this is going to be you.

2872
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:09,400
This is going to be you.

2873
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:12,420
God chose you for this.

2874
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:13,420
Live your life.

2875
02:11:13,420 --> 02:11:14,420
Shit bag.

2876
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:15,420
Yeah.

2877
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:16,420
Yeah.

2878
02:11:16,420 --> 02:11:17,420
Enjoy the next 40 years of your life.

2879
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:18,420
Knowing that this is what you end up.

2880
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:19,840
Oh, that would be great.

2881
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:20,840
This next clip.

2882
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:21,840
Jordan.

2883
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:22,840
Yes.

2884
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:23,840
Maybe one of my favorite swings.

2885
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:24,840
Mm hmm.

2886
02:11:24,840 --> 02:11:28,720
I can't like, Steve's had some big ones just about himself.

2887
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:31,120
Like most of Steve's stuff is like really braggadocio.

2888
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:34,560
It's really just, I am the most important person.

2889
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:36,200
I've done everything important.

2890
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:37,200
Yeah.

2891
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:39,280
I overthrew a Ghana twice.

2892
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:40,280
Yeah.

2893
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:44,280
And then when Steve comes in, man, Roger comes in again.

2894
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:45,280
You're doing it again.

2895
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:46,600
Well, it's because of the swing.

2896
02:11:46,600 --> 02:11:47,600
Okay.

2897
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:48,600
Let's hear it.

2898
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:57,240
I just learned of, uh, absolute incontrovertible evidence of North Korean boats delivering,

2899
02:11:57,240 --> 02:12:00,600
uh, ballots through a Harbor in Maine.

2900
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:01,600
Yes.

2901
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:02,600
The state agreed.

2902
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:09,120
Uh, if this checks out, if law enforcement looked, if this checks out to be true, it

2903
02:12:09,120 --> 02:12:14,400
would be proof of foreign involvement in the election.

2904
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:17,000
This is North Korean.

2905
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,840
This is the best North Korean boat.

2906
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,840
Let me walk through this.

2907
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:23,640
Our North Korean.

2908
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:28,760
They arrived in Maine, Maine to deliver North.

2909
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:29,760
Hold on.

2910
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:30,760
Okay.

2911
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:31,760
In the world.

2912
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:37,120
They had to come by boat to deliver this fake ballot.

2913
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:39,880
Man.

2914
02:12:39,880 --> 02:12:47,280
So the number of questions raises brings this claim into the territory of farce.

2915
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:48,280
That is a swing.

2916
02:12:48,280 --> 02:12:49,720
That is a swing for the fences.

2917
02:12:49,720 --> 02:12:54,800
If this is a sprawling conspiracy involving tons of countries and us actors, why did North

2918
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:55,800
Korea have the ballots?

2919
02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:58,600
Why couldn't they have been printed domestically?

2920
02:12:58,600 --> 02:13:01,560
Why would these conspirators need to print the ballots in North Korea?

2921
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:05,840
Then have the country that's under the heaviest surveillance and under very strict embargoes

2922
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:11,920
carry out a delivery by sea, which would obviously raise alarms no matter what the cargo was.

2923
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:17,960
Also you were sort of, why would they arrive in Maine?

2924
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:21,800
Does Roger not realize that in order for a North Korean boat to reach Maine, they would

2925
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:33,320
need to either navigate South of Africa, then head North or transit through the Panama canal.

2926
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:37,840
North Korea would have a much easier, but still almost ridiculously impossible time

2927
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:42,040
getting a boat to the West coast, like some state on the West coast, since they're shorelines

2928
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:44,720
on the sea of Japan, which leads to the Pacific ocean.

2929
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:48,960
If we're just imagining that these North Korean boats can show up wherever they want, then

2930
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:50,680
why wouldn't they go to Hawaii?

2931
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:52,600
That's definitely their closest shot.

2932
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:57,680
Literally, there could not be a more complicated coastal state for North Korea to get to than

2933
02:13:57,680 --> 02:13:59,240
Maine by boat.

2934
02:13:59,240 --> 02:14:01,040
How did he choose that one?

2935
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:04,720
So if this is true, shouldn't this be intensely embarrassing for Trump?

2936
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:08,400
Like that dude bent over backwards trying to impress and appease Kim Jong Un, and now

2937
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:12,800
in Trump's hour of need, his dictator buddy sends a boat full of ballots halfway across

2938
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:14,640
the world to screw him over.

2939
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:18,160
That seems like an indication that Trump's deal making skills are what the cracked up

2940
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:19,160
to be.

2941
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:21,080
I mean this sincerely, Jordan.

2942
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:25,000
This is the most amazingly stupid theory that I think I've ever heard someone suggest on

2943
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Infowars.

2944
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:29,240
I've never heard anything like this in my entire life.

2945
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:33,480
There have been dumber theories, I think, but this is something that Roger is suggesting

2946
02:14:33,480 --> 02:14:37,160
as being supported by, quote, absolute incontrovertible.

2947
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:45,220
I am more likely to believe the earth is flat than that North Korea could successfully secretly

2948
02:14:45,220 --> 02:14:49,760
get boats to Maine, period.

2949
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:50,760
Full of ballots.

2950
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:51,760
No, I don't.

2951
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:56,800
I mean, even like a dinghy, a dinghy with North Korea printed on the side of it couldn't

2952
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:59,320
get to Maine from North Korea.

2953
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:00,400
That is insane.

2954
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:06,480
If North Koreans could get, like if the state of North Korea could get boats full of ballots

2955
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:10,680
to Maine, why are we worried about their rocket program?

2956
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:16,760
Like they could just bring a bomb.

2957
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:22,120
North Koreans just fucking lift a bomb into Maine and then walk away and get on their

2958
02:15:22,120 --> 02:15:25,840
boats and click a button and like, haha, we've defeated you Americans.

2959
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:32,040
I feel like Roger's acting like the surveillance on North Korea is just like a guy asleep.

2960
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:33,040
It must be.

2961
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:34,040
It must be.

2962
02:15:34,040 --> 02:15:35,040
Just in front of a bunch of monitors.

2963
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:36,040
No, no, no.

2964
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:39,880
They put a picture of the room that they were supposed to be monitoring in the camera so

2965
02:15:39,880 --> 02:15:41,800
it looks like that the...

2966
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:42,800
But it's not.

2967
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:44,840
It's a picture on top of the camera.

2968
02:15:44,840 --> 02:15:48,780
I'm baffled by this, but I do think that this is the kind of thing you can get someone to

2969
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:51,280
say whenever you get them out of prison.

2970
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:52,280
Yep.

2971
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:54,000
This is the kind of...

2972
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Yeah, sure.

2973
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,280
You can do whatever the fuck you want, man.

2974
02:15:56,280 --> 02:16:00,080
Yeah, hey man, you were destined to be here by God and North Korean boats are the only

2975
02:16:00,080 --> 02:16:01,240
reason you lost the election.

2976
02:16:01,240 --> 02:16:03,120
They showed up in Maine and fucked you over.

2977
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:08,000
Hey buddy, I got takeout last night instead of being in jail, so guess what?

2978
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,440
North Korea did it to Maine.

2979
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:10,440
Don't care.

2980
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:11,440
Moving on.

2981
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:15,400
It's awesome too because someone had to have made this up and that means that someone made

2982
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:18,360
up a story with the stupidest stake.

2983
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:22,360
There can't possibly be something else that this is based on.

2984
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:24,040
I don't know.

2985
02:16:24,040 --> 02:16:29,920
Sell me on a thoroughly controvertible document.

2986
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:34,520
I tried to look for some indication of what the fuck Roger was talking about and any story

2987
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:38,120
that I could find had to do with Roger saying this.

2988
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:39,120
So I don't know.

2989
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:40,120
Okay.

2990
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:41,120
I don't know.

2991
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:42,520
Maybe it's some deep thing on Twitter I couldn't find.

2992
02:16:42,520 --> 02:16:43,520
That's a big swing.

2993
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:48,000
I wouldn't be surprised if this was another QAnon thing, quite frankly, but just like

2994
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,000
god damn.

2995
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Roger, buddy.

2996
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Say it out loud.

2997
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Buddy, Roger.

2998
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:57,440
Put a globe in front of you and then just don't give me any documents.

2999
02:16:57,440 --> 02:17:00,920
Put a globe on your desk and just point to how they got there.

3000
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:01,920
Show me how they both got there.

3001
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:02,920
Just with your finger.

3002
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:03,920
Did it go north?

3003
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:04,920
I'm not asking for details.

3004
02:17:04,920 --> 02:17:05,920
Did it go north?

3005
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:06,920
Did it go above China and Russia?

3006
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:07,920
Do your best.

3007
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:08,920
Do your best.

3008
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:09,920
Through the arctic?

3009
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:10,920
Yeah, I don't care.

3010
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:11,920
Did it go up there?

3011
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:13,320
There are actual shipping lanes.

3012
02:17:13,320 --> 02:17:14,320
Just do your best.

3013
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:16,680
Did it go down?

3014
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:19,080
Maybe try to get through the Straits of Gibraltar?

3015
02:17:19,080 --> 02:17:22,800
Maybe try to get into the Mediterranean and then go through there?

3016
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:24,240
Very serious question.

3017
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:26,280
Did it go through the earth?

3018
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:31,800
I think that the only state it would be more difficult to get a boat to is Kansas.

3019
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:34,600
Because it's in the middle of the fucking country.

3020
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:39,600
Because it would take a huge wave to get in there.

3021
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:40,600
Really have to get up there.

3022
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:43,720
It's a fucking black rock or some shit.

3023
02:17:43,720 --> 02:17:45,880
Fitzcarraldo is easier to say.

3024
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:46,880
Yes, exactly.

3025
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:49,720
It's a better reference than my lost reference.

3026
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:51,400
So that's silly.

3027
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:52,400
And Roger is dumb.

3028
02:17:52,400 --> 02:17:53,400
Very silly.

3029
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:57,280
But this next clip of Roger is like, hey man, you've forgotten the script.

3030
02:17:57,280 --> 02:18:00,760
I have a very high regard for Sidney Powell.

3031
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:06,400
I have an equally high regard for my old friend, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who I've had a friendship

3032
02:18:06,400 --> 02:18:11,240
with since his first campaign for mayor of New York City.

3033
02:18:11,240 --> 02:18:13,600
Hey guy, didn't Rudy cover up 9-11?

3034
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:15,280
No, no, no, no.

3035
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:18,040
Forgiven, passing on, moving on.

3036
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:19,040
Don't worry about it.

3037
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:23,800
So Roger also thinks that Trump supporters need to get aggressive and they need to force

3038
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:28,500
legislatures to just say, hey, Trump's cool, let him stay president.

3039
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:31,480
And then we get a very familiar phenomenon.

3040
02:18:31,480 --> 02:18:37,320
And I think supporters of the president in the key states need to begin now contacting

3041
02:18:37,320 --> 02:18:39,360
your Republican state legislators.

3042
02:18:39,360 --> 02:18:43,920
Those are your Republican state senators or your state representatives.

3043
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:50,280
Some states, they call them assemblies and urge them to support the president, to support

3044
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:56,500
an objective and honest count of the election and the certification of electors that will

3045
02:18:56,500 --> 02:19:00,880
support Donald Trump at the electoral college.

3046
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:03,360
The Stonewalling, there's no evidence, is ridiculous.

3047
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:04,880
Yeah, it sure is.

3048
02:19:04,880 --> 02:19:06,880
How's that sandwich?

3049
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:10,280
Stonewalling is strong.

3050
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:11,280
So Alex-

3051
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:13,320
Do more of the German guy again.

3052
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:18,420
Alex bids farewell to Roger and he doesn't add, and he talks about how he has a promo

3053
02:19:18,420 --> 02:19:19,420
code.

3054
02:19:19,420 --> 02:19:24,480
You put Patriot on the website, you get 10% more off, and he's like, I never do promo

3055
02:19:24,480 --> 02:19:25,480
codes.

3056
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:29,000
And I started to think about it like, I don't think I have heard him do a promo code.

3057
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Well, that's a good question.

3058
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,520
Because I think I would have made fun of it.

3059
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:32,520
I think so.

3060
02:19:32,520 --> 02:19:35,000
I think I would have made fun of whatever word he chose to be the promo code.

3061
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,240
I think we would have gotten there sooner or later, yeah.

3062
02:19:37,240 --> 02:19:38,240
Yeah.

3063
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:39,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3064
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:40,960
I don't feel like he does do promo codes very often.

3065
02:19:40,960 --> 02:19:43,080
I can't think of a time where we've made fun of him.

3066
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:44,080
That's interesting.

3067
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:46,720
I don't know what that means, but he then gets into talking about how you need-

3068
02:19:46,720 --> 02:19:48,560
It means you get an extra 10% off, buddy.

3069
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:49,560
I'm not buying shit.

3070
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:50,560
Oh, okay.

3071
02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:51,560
You need fish oil.

3072
02:19:51,560 --> 02:19:52,560
Yes, you do.

3073
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:53,560
And so do your kids.

3074
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:54,560
Sure, they do.

3075
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:55,560
Wait, can they choose to take fish oil?

3076
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:56,560
Promo code Patriot, emplorestore.com.

3077
02:19:56,560 --> 02:19:58,560
Just want to remind you, you're the reason we're on air.

3078
02:19:58,560 --> 02:19:59,560
Thank you.

3079
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:03,040
These are great products you and your family need, especially for children, man.

3080
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:04,640
This fish oil is so good for children.

3081
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:05,640
So good for everybody.

3082
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:08,440
But man, I tell you what it does for their brains.

3083
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:11,200
It's what your brain literally runs on.

3084
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:13,640
It's like the perfect thing compared to like sugar.

3085
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:15,120
Sugar's horrible for your brain.

3086
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:18,280
This is what it actually runs on, but I'm digressing.

3087
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:19,280
Yeah.

3088
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:22,320
I don't know if it's like fish oil or sugar.

3089
02:20:22,320 --> 02:20:23,800
I don't know if those are the-

3090
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:25,440
It's fish oil or sugar.

3091
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:26,440
It is not glucose.

3092
02:20:26,440 --> 02:20:31,520
It is not Omega-3s or whatever you would like.

3093
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:34,760
It is either a big bowl of fish oil-

3094
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:37,200
I can't imagine a conversation between parents.

3095
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:39,440
One of them's Alex and he's like, yeah, you should give your kids fish oil.

3096
02:20:39,440 --> 02:20:41,960
And the other parent's like, no, we're going with sugar.

3097
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:46,280
I give them sugar pills every morning, about twice a day.

3098
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:48,200
Just concentrated stuff though.

3099
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:56,080
So at this point in the episode, Alex realizes that Lynn Wood, the attorney, is doing the

3100
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:57,080
press conference.

3101
02:20:57,080 --> 02:20:58,080
Yes.

3102
02:20:58,080 --> 02:20:59,080
Bat shit.

3103
02:20:59,080 --> 02:21:00,080
Quite.

3104
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:01,080
Yeah.

3105
02:21:01,080 --> 02:21:02,080
Yeah.

3106
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:03,080
Absolute wild bat shit.

3107
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:04,080
And so Alex goes to it live and I was like, holy shit.

3108
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:05,080
I love it.

3109
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:12,400
1776, we'll commence again.

3110
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:15,240
We're going to send that message.

3111
02:21:15,240 --> 02:21:19,000
We're going to send that message to George Soros.

3112
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:23,160
Get out of our country George Soros.

3113
02:21:23,160 --> 02:21:25,520
He's not here.

3114
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:26,920
Oh shit.

3115
02:21:26,920 --> 02:21:29,200
This is so scary.

3116
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:31,600
I mean, we're laughing, but that's fucking terrifying.

3117
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:32,600
No, no, no.

3118
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:33,600
Yeah.

3119
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:37,400
That's fucking, yeah, that is a Hitler rally.

3120
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:38,920
That's not a non Hitler rally.

3121
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:44,240
That is a Hitler rally where Hitler would Hitler, get out of our country.

3122
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:45,240
Hitler rally.

3123
02:21:45,240 --> 02:21:46,240
Hitler.

3124
02:21:46,240 --> 02:21:47,240
Poor Hitler.

3125
02:21:47,240 --> 02:21:49,800
That is five Hitler mustaches, Dan.

3126
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:50,800
On a scale of one to five.

3127
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:51,880
On a scale of one to five mustaches.

3128
02:21:51,880 --> 02:21:54,440
I think it's four just because you got to leave some room.

3129
02:21:54,440 --> 02:21:55,440
That's true.

3130
02:21:55,440 --> 02:21:56,800
There's more Hitler to be done.

3131
02:21:56,800 --> 02:21:57,800
Yeah.

3132
02:21:57,800 --> 02:22:03,560
So Lynn Wood gets around to talking about, hey, hey, look, the media.

3133
02:22:03,560 --> 02:22:04,560
Bad.

3134
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:05,560
Sure.

3135
02:22:05,560 --> 02:22:07,120
There's there are places that are good though.

3136
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:08,760
Oh, well, that's good to know.

3137
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:09,760
Yeah.

3138
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:12,040
Especially because this is being broadcast live on info wars.

3139
02:22:12,040 --> 02:22:13,040
Yes.

3140
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:15,240
Now everybody's been reading the media.

3141
02:22:15,240 --> 02:22:16,240
Stop.

3142
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:17,240
It's a lie.

3143
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:19,040
It's a lie.

3144
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:20,280
You can't trust them.

3145
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:22,280
Stick with OAN and Newsmax.

3146
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:25,920
They tell you the truth.

3147
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:26,920
Read the Epoch Times.

3148
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:28,920
They tell you the truth.

3149
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:30,560
We'll never say I'm bored.

3150
02:22:30,560 --> 02:22:32,920
This is a battle between good and evil.

3151
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:36,080
They'll never say info wars were too powerful.

3152
02:22:36,080 --> 02:22:38,360
That is sad.

3153
02:22:38,360 --> 02:22:40,400
That is sad.

3154
02:22:40,400 --> 02:22:42,160
That is so sad.

3155
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:47,480
Even fucking crazy people with nothing to lose are no better than to associate themselves

3156
02:22:47,480 --> 02:22:48,480
with that.

3157
02:22:48,480 --> 02:22:49,480
So sad.

3158
02:22:49,480 --> 02:22:53,640
The dude would have no problem saying info wars if he actually thought they were worth

3159
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:54,640
a damn.

3160
02:22:54,640 --> 02:22:55,640
Yep.

3161
02:22:55,640 --> 02:22:56,640
Oh my God.

3162
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:57,640
Yep.

3163
02:22:57,640 --> 02:23:00,600
If they thought info wars was going to grow, they would say info wars immediately.

3164
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:04,560
You know what's a better propagandist right now?

3165
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:05,560
Coat rack.

3166
02:23:05,560 --> 02:23:06,560
Yeah.

3167
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:07,560
Just a random person.

3168
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:08,560
Yep.

3169
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:11,840
A random face that is shaved and in a suit is better than Alex.

3170
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:17,800
This coat rack has done a great job of being there, not talking, which is better than Alex

3171
02:23:17,800 --> 02:23:18,800
Jones.

3172
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:19,800
Yeah.

3173
02:23:19,800 --> 02:23:22,480
A random person who doesn't have the intense baggage that Alex has.

3174
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:23,680
Oh, let's see.

3175
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:28,000
Someone who doesn't have to fucking pretend that the president's son told him to investigate

3176
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:29,000
something.

3177
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,960
Someone who's not an embarrassing sack.

3178
02:23:30,960 --> 02:23:31,960
Yeah.

3179
02:23:31,960 --> 02:23:35,120
Um, anyway, uh, Alex is like, yeah, we'll go back to it.

3180
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:36,120
We'll go back to this.

3181
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:37,120
We'll jump back and forth.

3182
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:38,120
I got to take some calls.

3183
02:23:38,120 --> 02:23:39,840
I'll take some calls.

3184
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:44,640
So this, uh, this caller, he decides that, uh, war is coming.

3185
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:50,880
But like Dr. P says, Dr. Prochnik is the art of war and God has drawn out the enemy.

3186
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:55,240
Now they are completely exposed, completely uncovered, and there's nothing that they can

3187
02:23:55,240 --> 02:23:56,240
do.

3188
02:23:56,240 --> 02:23:57,700
And Trump doesn't have to do another thing.

3189
02:23:57,700 --> 02:24:01,640
We, the people will do the rest, like Glenwood or like Glenwood just said.

3190
02:24:01,640 --> 02:24:08,040
And so I would say this, the declaration of war date is January 11th, 2021, according

3191
02:24:08,040 --> 02:24:14,000
to the executive order that was revived September 12th, 2020 Trump knows what's up, but do we

3192
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:15,000
know what's up?

3193
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Are we ready?

3194
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:20,160
Are we the people ready to take this country back from the globalist that have controlled

3195
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:21,160
it since the 18.

3196
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:25,780
So you're saying he's not up there commanding the forces that he wants it to be organic.

3197
02:24:25,780 --> 02:24:26,780
He's leaving it in our hands.

3198
02:24:26,780 --> 02:24:27,780
I hear you.

3199
02:24:27,780 --> 02:24:28,780
I think that's what he's doing.

3200
02:24:28,780 --> 02:24:29,780
Yeah.

3201
02:24:29,780 --> 02:24:34,720
Well, we better hit the streets and like Linwood's doing it, like we're doing, trying to find

3202
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:36,920
meaning in your lack of leadership.

3203
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:37,920
Yep.

3204
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:38,920
Yep.

3205
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:40,720
He wants us to be a revolution.

3206
02:24:40,720 --> 02:24:41,720
Violent.

3207
02:24:41,720 --> 02:24:42,720
Wow.

3208
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:45,120
So, uh, Rogan is everybody always want to fight a war.

3209
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:46,320
It's 2020.

3210
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:47,720
We can't outsmart these idiots.

3211
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:49,000
What are we doing?

3212
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Fighting a war.

3213
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:51,000
What are you doing?

3214
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:52,240
Fighting a war.

3215
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:55,240
Look, humans are not 50 years old.

3216
02:24:55,240 --> 02:24:57,960
Look, the issue is that Rogan's coming up tomorrow.

3217
02:24:57,960 --> 02:24:58,960
Sure.

3218
02:24:58,960 --> 02:24:59,960
Now it's promotes that.

3219
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:06,040
And then the show takes the leftist of left turns, rightist of right turns as I'm not

3220
02:25:06,040 --> 02:25:07,040
positive.

3221
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:09,080
It's just a crazy turn out of left field.

3222
02:25:09,080 --> 02:25:11,200
Joe Rogan is on the show tomorrow.

3223
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:12,200
Yep.

3224
02:25:12,200 --> 02:25:14,320
Right here in studio.

3225
02:25:14,320 --> 02:25:15,320
So look for that.

3226
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:20,680
And a lot of other surprises.

3227
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:24,400
You know, I've known Steve Pacinik for, I'm sorry, what?

3228
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:30,620
And I knew he was in the CFR and I knew that, uh, he did run the overthrow of multiple governments.

3229
02:25:30,620 --> 02:25:35,480
That's in the congressional record and a lot of other things.

3230
02:25:35,480 --> 02:25:40,640
And pretty much everything you ever told me turned out to be very accurate.

3231
02:25:40,640 --> 02:25:46,420
But I just, I believe he was told by high level folks in the CIA that Trump's done this

3232
02:25:46,420 --> 02:25:49,200
thing and they're all going to the global struggle.

3233
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:53,720
I just wonder if they're feeding him a lot of bull because man, I mean, you saw what

3234
02:25:53,720 --> 02:25:55,280
Barr came out and did and everything else.

3235
02:25:55,280 --> 02:26:00,000
I just, I'm not up here saying we're out of the woods and I, and I'm not up here saying

3236
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:01,200
that I'm not disagreeing with him.

3237
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:05,560
I'm not saying I think he's a disingenuous person or a liar.

3238
02:26:05,560 --> 02:26:07,640
I just, you know, I have a bad feeling.

3239
02:26:07,640 --> 02:26:08,640
Yeah.

3240
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:09,640
Yeah.

3241
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:14,040
So Alex is, uh, is, uh, this is, this is weird because he did say that Steve was still working

3242
02:26:14,040 --> 02:26:19,200
for the CIA after the Las Vegas shooting when Steve tried to convince him that no one died

3243
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:20,200
and it was all fake.

3244
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:25,560
Um, so now, uh, he's trying to retain Steve's credibility, but just, he's been fooled by

3245
02:26:25,560 --> 02:26:27,540
high level CIA people.

3246
02:26:27,540 --> 02:26:31,520
He's trying to, he's trying to have his cake and eat it too here and it's just not good.

3247
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:33,460
You gotta cut ties or you gotta lean in.

3248
02:26:33,460 --> 02:26:36,120
You can't half ass with, uh, Stevie P's.

3249
02:26:36,120 --> 02:26:39,380
But I do, I do kind of feel like, yeah, good call.

3250
02:26:39,380 --> 02:26:40,380
Good call.

3251
02:26:40,380 --> 02:26:42,980
Like knowing at least that you can't agree with him.

3252
02:26:42,980 --> 02:26:45,320
This one might be too, this one might be too much even for, even for us.

3253
02:26:45,320 --> 02:26:48,560
Well, because it's, again, David Knight just texted me mean language.

3254
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:51,680
But it's also like what we talked about on the first time this came up.

3255
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:57,560
It's too falsifiable when this never comes up, uh, up, it's like, Oh, what happened?

3256
02:26:57,560 --> 02:27:00,200
I thought the election was a fucking sting operation.

3257
02:27:00,200 --> 02:27:01,600
All the proof should be there.

3258
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:02,600
Where is it?

3259
02:27:02,600 --> 02:27:03,600
Yeah.

3260
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:05,240
It's, it's a disappointing game.

3261
02:27:05,240 --> 02:27:11,880
But look, Steve might be wrong because people might be lying to us.

3262
02:27:11,880 --> 02:27:12,880
True.

3263
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:13,880
But there's one thing that's totally true.

3264
02:27:13,880 --> 02:27:14,880
What's that?

3265
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:19,680
I mean, he wasn't joking, um, when he said China called him a pachinik has sent me video

3266
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:23,360
and photos when he's in North Korea, hanging out with the North Koreans.

3267
02:27:23,360 --> 02:27:27,680
I mean, he gets around folks and so I'll just leave it at that.

3268
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:34,480
He took a boat, uh, but, uh, from Florida to North Korea, he says Beijing, you know,

3269
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:38,440
high level operatives called him and they're like, yeah, I know.

3270
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:39,880
We know Trump's going to win.

3271
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:44,860
You notice Putin won't congratulate Biden, man.

3272
02:27:44,860 --> 02:27:46,240
This is really sad.

3273
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:47,240
Yeah.

3274
02:27:47,240 --> 02:27:51,360
Steve, Steve is like, Oh, well, man, you know, maybe, maybe he's wrong about all this, but

3275
02:27:51,360 --> 02:27:53,880
China did call him because I've been courted.

3276
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:54,880
Shut up.

3277
02:27:54,880 --> 02:27:58,480
You can't even get it up for Steve pajana getting a call from China.

3278
02:27:58,480 --> 02:28:00,560
No, I've seen him.

3279
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:01,880
He was in North Korea one time.

3280
02:28:01,880 --> 02:28:04,600
Hey, it's funny that you bring up, uh, getting it up.

3281
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:06,200
I can't take super volatility.

3282
02:28:06,200 --> 02:28:07,880
I obviously don't need it.

3283
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:12,200
Uh, but I mean, I don't want to get graphic as a family show, but I don't need to be walking

3284
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:16,520
around with, you know, something going on downstairs.

3285
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:17,520
Okay.

3286
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:21,320
I mean, I, I mean, I take it, I mean, it's ridiculous.

3287
02:28:21,320 --> 02:28:28,280
It's like waking up at 4 0 AM or 5 0 AM, you know, you've, you've got a, an erection.

3288
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:32,400
Is super male vitality actually just like straight up bull hormones?

3289
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:34,440
What the fuck is it?

3290
02:28:34,440 --> 02:28:37,320
Every time we hear about it, it's like, Oh yeah, yeah.

3291
02:28:37,320 --> 02:28:39,160
His wife walks bow legged.

3292
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:41,040
So buy this fucking boner.

3293
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:42,040
I love it.

3294
02:28:42,040 --> 02:28:45,160
I've never heard, I've never heard that moment happen.

3295
02:28:45,160 --> 02:28:49,680
That moment of Alex being forced to say the word erection.

3296
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:51,580
That is so awful.

3297
02:28:51,580 --> 02:28:52,840
It really was gross.

3298
02:28:52,840 --> 02:28:53,840
It really was gross.

3299
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:56,760
I have cursed all of you with that.

3300
02:28:56,760 --> 02:28:58,640
I was trying not to focus on it.

3301
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:04,080
So Alex goes back to calls and uh, he's, he's sitting here and he's like, he's having a

3302
02:29:04,080 --> 02:29:07,880
good time with this caller because this caller is speculating that, Hey man, these globalists

3303
02:29:07,880 --> 02:29:12,600
they're so out of control, they'll probably let China grounded invade us.

3304
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:13,600
Sure.

3305
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:14,600
Right.

3306
02:29:14,600 --> 02:29:15,600
That's probably what they're going to do in boats.

3307
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:20,040
And because Alex was so excited about this, he accidentally let this guy keep talking.

3308
02:29:20,040 --> 02:29:24,920
These go, there's a man who's so corrupt, they so dangerous that they don't, I think

3309
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:25,920
they're going to let China invade.

3310
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:29,120
I can just say, they want to break this.

3311
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:33,040
They are foaming at the mouth to kill us because it's a spiritual thing.

3312
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:34,040
I agree.

3313
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:35,040
Tell me what your gut tells you.

3314
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:38,760
Oh man, it's going to fall like Ukraine and go by to get in.

3315
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:44,160
He's going to go against the American Patriots, the white people of the country that he hates.

3316
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:45,160
They hate us.

3317
02:29:45,160 --> 02:29:48,400
That's why they robbed the whole, uh, belt, uh, with the votes.

3318
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:52,760
All the white people right there voted Trump is we've seen it that night, but he's going

3319
02:29:52,760 --> 02:29:58,520
to cause war against the white Patriots soon as he get in office and then maybe I think

3320
02:29:58,520 --> 02:30:01,560
no, I agree to try to trick white people to attack black people.

3321
02:30:01,560 --> 02:30:06,960
No, it ain't about black and white because I'm saying they're trying to trick us to kill

3322
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:07,960
each other though.

3323
02:30:07,960 --> 02:30:11,640
Yeah, but black people won't, they know what's going on.

3324
02:30:11,640 --> 02:30:15,680
But uh, these people that sent top, they don't like their own color, man.

3325
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:17,080
They want to kill y'all.

3326
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:18,080
Oh boy.

3327
02:30:18,080 --> 02:30:21,840
Alex, you should have pretended he hung up.

3328
02:30:21,840 --> 02:30:26,480
I am not comfortable in this conversation.

3329
02:30:26,480 --> 02:30:32,480
This caller who I've had a great time talking to has now revealed that he believes that

3330
02:30:32,480 --> 02:30:34,640
the Patriots are the white people.

3331
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:37,080
It's very clear.

3332
02:30:37,080 --> 02:30:44,200
Uh, I um, it is fun where he's, he's like, no, no, I'm doing a good job.

3333
02:30:44,200 --> 02:30:45,920
I'm saying what you're saying.

3334
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:47,080
All the Patriots are the white people.

3335
02:30:47,080 --> 02:30:49,400
And he's like, no, no, you're not supposed to actually say that.

3336
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:52,560
And so Alex tries to save it by being like, yeah, they're trying to get the white people

3337
02:30:52,560 --> 02:30:53,920
to foolishly attack the black people.

3338
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:54,920
No, no, no, no.

3339
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:55,920
Black people are fine.

3340
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:59,320
It's not about white people.

3341
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:04,880
So Alex gets, uh, gets back from commercial break and I will say that, uh, you belong

3342
02:31:04,880 --> 02:31:05,880
to the city.

3343
02:31:05,880 --> 02:31:10,120
Did play once during this episode and Alex didn't get enthusiastic about it.

3344
02:31:10,120 --> 02:31:15,400
However, Gnarls Barkley, uh, the song crazy sure plays and Alex does get a little excited

3345
02:31:15,400 --> 02:31:16,400
for this.

3346
02:31:16,400 --> 02:31:17,400
It is not the destination.

3347
02:31:17,400 --> 02:31:18,400
It is the journey.

3348
02:31:18,400 --> 02:31:19,400
It's a test, my friends.

3349
02:31:19,400 --> 02:31:20,400
And it's real.

3350
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:36,040
It's my only advice, Jeff sucker, look at you, you think you're in control?

3351
02:31:36,040 --> 02:31:37,040
Don't do it.

3352
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:38,040
Don't do it.

3353
02:31:38,040 --> 02:32:06,640
You might've noticed that the song skip there and that's good as Alex said, you guys are

3354
02:32:06,640 --> 02:32:11,080
in control of the bleep button at the wrong time.

3355
02:32:11,080 --> 02:32:16,480
So the shit went out over the air and a little cut, skip the part where he says, drop that.

3356
02:32:16,480 --> 02:32:17,480
Yep.

3357
02:32:17,480 --> 02:32:18,480
Yeah.

3358
02:32:18,480 --> 02:32:19,480
You got really into it.

3359
02:32:19,480 --> 02:32:24,840
I do like him that that's probably the most unhinged I've heard anyone sound in a good

3360
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:25,920
long while.

3361
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:27,840
That was, that was out there.

3362
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:28,840
Yeah.

3363
02:32:28,840 --> 02:32:33,320
So Alex, uh, you know, he's into predictive programming and loves, uh, when it loves people

3364
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:35,520
to say that movies are reality.

3365
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:36,760
This is a new one for me.

3366
02:32:36,760 --> 02:32:39,040
Hey, Hey Alex, two things here.

3367
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:43,200
Number one, if you remember a movie that came out in 2006, man of the year, Robin Williams,

3368
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:48,160
they had an election, the voting machines switched the election and switched your results

3369
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:51,880
to the candidate that was less desirable, just like what's happening right now.

3370
02:32:51,880 --> 02:32:53,160
That's right.

3371
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:54,160
That's a good movie.

3372
02:32:54,160 --> 02:32:56,160
It's set in Latin America.

3373
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:57,400
Correct.

3374
02:32:57,400 --> 02:32:58,400
Good conversation.

3375
02:32:58,400 --> 02:33:03,200
Hey, there's this movie that it's real.

3376
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:09,860
These people just cannot believe for one second that the guy for the past four years, they

3377
02:33:09,860 --> 02:33:16,920
have heard nothing but horrible shit about from one huge section of the country.

3378
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:20,200
They can't believe that that guy might not be beloved.

3379
02:33:20,200 --> 02:33:22,800
Well, no, because they haven't heard that.

3380
02:33:22,800 --> 02:33:29,120
It's all the mainstream media that's creating this false perception that no one likes Trump.

3381
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:30,120
Okay.

3382
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:31,120
That's fine.

3383
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:35,120
Yeah, I mean, I guess that everybody in this world lives in their own bubble where they

3384
02:33:35,120 --> 02:33:40,580
don't have to deal with like reality at all, but I mean, you can't go out, you can't walk

3385
02:33:40,580 --> 02:33:43,640
down the street and not be like, Oh, a lot of people hate Trump.

3386
02:33:43,640 --> 02:33:48,440
Well, it's, it's kind of, you know, it's an interesting line that I struggle with sometimes

3387
02:33:48,440 --> 02:33:53,320
or at least I have in the past and that is that like, you can recognize that organizations

3388
02:33:53,320 --> 02:33:58,480
like the Koch brothers and stuff, they do fund things massively on the right, astroturf

3389
02:33:58,480 --> 02:34:00,180
stuff.

3390
02:34:00,180 --> 02:34:07,600
But knowing that you cannot say that people don't believe conservative principles or values

3391
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:10,000
or have right leaning politics.

3392
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:14,500
You can't say that all that's fake because there is this libertarian monied interest

3393
02:34:14,500 --> 02:34:19,360
that's floating in and trying to push things that way.

3394
02:34:19,360 --> 02:34:25,280
This same is sort of the trap that Alex and a lot of the Trump folk fall into, which is

3395
02:34:25,280 --> 02:34:29,980
like they think that the media is just telling everyone that Trump is bad.

3396
02:34:29,980 --> 02:34:35,340
And then they're sort of thinking that no one actually believes that the media is crumbling

3397
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:40,280
and it's powerless and it's pathetic and everyone knows they're liars now.

3398
02:34:40,280 --> 02:34:41,280
Yeah.

3399
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:45,320
But yeah, so that's kind of the trap that they're in.

3400
02:34:45,320 --> 02:34:46,320
Yeah.

3401
02:34:46,320 --> 02:34:52,960
I mean, I guess when you, I suppose if you dehumanize enough people or a large enough

3402
02:34:52,960 --> 02:34:59,160
group, then eventually people who know who are like, Oh no, I know plenty of people who

3403
02:34:59,160 --> 02:35:01,640
would normally fall into that group.

3404
02:35:01,640 --> 02:35:06,520
They must secretly be Trump supporters too or something because it's like, how can I,

3405
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:07,520
I don't know.

3406
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:08,520
I don't know.

3407
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:09,520
These, this is nuts.

3408
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:10,520
Yeah.

3409
02:35:10,520 --> 02:35:11,520
Wild.

3410
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:16,280
So this caller believes that Biden, if he gets in, Kamala Harris will become president.

3411
02:35:16,280 --> 02:35:17,920
Biden will get out of there somehow.

3412
02:35:17,920 --> 02:35:18,920
Sure.

3413
02:35:18,920 --> 02:35:21,760
And then he'll trip and fall and wear an ankle bracelet.

3414
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:28,240
And then Kamala Harris will make either AOC or Hillary, there we go, vice president.

3415
02:35:28,240 --> 02:35:32,640
And then Alex asks the most introspective question I could imagine.

3416
02:35:32,640 --> 02:35:33,640
All right.

3417
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:36,920
If Biden stays in within six months, he's going to have a stroke or he's going to be

3418
02:35:36,920 --> 02:35:41,600
declared incompetent, which is going to move Kamala Harris into the president's spot.

3419
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:46,760
And she's going to either put either AOC or Hillary Clinton in as her vice president.

3420
02:35:46,760 --> 02:35:47,760
Why?

3421
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:51,800
That it would be the absolute worst scenario for this country if that would happen.

3422
02:35:51,800 --> 02:35:54,280
Why?

3423
02:35:54,280 --> 02:35:55,800
Why is there such a cult of Hillary?

3424
02:35:55,800 --> 02:35:59,920
Is this, is she such a devil worshiper like the demon that's able to inhabit her is like

3425
02:35:59,920 --> 02:36:00,920
they worship her.

3426
02:36:00,920 --> 02:36:01,920
Yeah.

3427
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:02,920
Yeah.

3428
02:36:02,920 --> 02:36:06,560
Why is the left so obsessed with Hillary Clinton?

3429
02:36:06,560 --> 02:36:07,560
Yes.

3430
02:36:07,560 --> 02:36:11,960
Why are we the left obsessed, obsessed with him?

3431
02:36:11,960 --> 02:36:16,160
We just can't stop talking about Hillary, Dan.

3432
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:17,160
Wow.

3433
02:36:17,160 --> 02:36:18,160
Yeah.

3434
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:19,160
Yeah.

3435
02:36:19,160 --> 02:36:20,160
Yeah.

3436
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:21,160
Yeah.

3437
02:36:21,160 --> 02:36:22,160
Yeah.

3438
02:36:22,160 --> 02:36:23,160
That's pretty, pretty cool.

3439
02:36:23,160 --> 02:36:24,160
Pretty cool.

3440
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:27,200
I don't know if projection gets that loud.

3441
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:28,200
No.

3442
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:30,520
That's the most loud.

3443
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:34,920
So this, Alex gets another caller and this dude says that they're going to take over

3444
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:35,920
DC.

3445
02:36:35,920 --> 02:36:36,920
Sure.

3446
02:36:36,920 --> 02:36:37,920
Right?

3447
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:38,920
There's going to be a protest.

3448
02:36:38,920 --> 02:36:39,920
Yeah.

3449
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:40,920
Millions.

3450
02:36:40,920 --> 02:36:46,600
This is where I probably not going to do this, but now I do have the opportunity.

3451
02:36:46,600 --> 02:36:50,080
I don't know if I could do it safely, but if Alex did this, I would want to go make

3452
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:51,240
a documentary about it.

3453
02:36:51,240 --> 02:36:52,240
Okay.

3454
02:36:52,240 --> 02:36:53,240
I really, really will.

3455
02:36:53,240 --> 02:36:55,160
I already have the website ready to go.

3456
02:36:55,160 --> 02:36:56,160
Take over DC.com.

3457
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:57,160
Love it.

3458
02:36:57,160 --> 02:36:59,360
We're going to do with what you guys did.

3459
02:36:59,360 --> 02:37:00,360
Love it.

3460
02:37:00,360 --> 02:37:02,360
However, everybody needs to be out there.

3461
02:37:02,360 --> 02:37:03,960
We need to set up supply lines.

3462
02:37:03,960 --> 02:37:04,960
We need to camp.

3463
02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:06,360
We need to take care of those.

3464
02:37:06,360 --> 02:37:07,360
Come out there.

3465
02:37:07,360 --> 02:37:08,360
No, I agree.

3466
02:37:08,360 --> 02:37:09,360
In fact, I've already decided.

3467
02:37:09,360 --> 02:37:10,360
I'm moving into DC.

3468
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:11,360
Yes.

3469
02:37:11,360 --> 02:37:13,440
They let the homeless camp everywhere, but oh, watch, they'll say no.

3470
02:37:13,440 --> 02:37:16,100
I'm moving in to the Lincoln Memorial.

3471
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:17,100
I'm moving in there.

3472
02:37:17,100 --> 02:37:18,240
I'm going to live in DC.

3473
02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:24,800
I would love to go and document Alex's time at the Lincoln Memorial squatting.

3474
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:32,920
No, if you are listening to this and you have $5, I don't know where I was going to end

3475
02:37:32,920 --> 02:37:33,920
that.

3476
02:37:33,920 --> 02:37:36,120
We need a billion dollars to make that documentary is what I'm saying.

3477
02:37:36,120 --> 02:37:37,120
No, no, no, no, no.

3478
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:39,440
I don't want anybody to give money to make a documentary.

3479
02:37:39,440 --> 02:37:41,800
No, I was going the way wrong way in my head.

3480
02:37:41,800 --> 02:37:47,120
I just don't think I can do it because just logistics of the world.

3481
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:51,840
But I think that there's, there's such an amazing story to be told here if Alex were

3482
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:52,840
to go.

3483
02:37:52,840 --> 02:37:58,620
And that is that he would realize that it's winter in DC and here we go home.

3484
02:37:58,620 --> 02:37:59,620
Here we go.

3485
02:37:59,620 --> 02:38:00,880
This is what I got for you.

3486
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:02,920
We got to get Ken Burns in on this.

3487
02:38:02,920 --> 02:38:03,920
We got to get Ken Burns.

3488
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:05,560
We got to get Ken Burns.

3489
02:38:05,560 --> 02:38:06,560
We got to get everybody.

3490
02:38:06,560 --> 02:38:07,560
Yeah, totally.

3491
02:38:07,560 --> 02:38:08,560
Bring back Ronson.

3492
02:38:08,560 --> 02:38:09,560
Bring back Ronson.

3493
02:38:09,560 --> 02:38:12,120
Uh, it gets, uh, Louis Thoreau.

3494
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:13,120
Get Hertzog.

3495
02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:14,860
No, well, who better than Hertzog?

3496
02:38:14,860 --> 02:38:17,840
This is Grizzly Man 2, the grizzliest.

3497
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:20,560
Alex eats Owen Shroyer.

3498
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:21,560
It's too cold in DC.

3499
02:38:21,560 --> 02:38:24,480
It's too cold in DC!

3500
02:38:24,480 --> 02:38:27,240
Or Owen Shroyer skins Alex and wears him like a blanket.

3501
02:38:27,240 --> 02:38:31,760
Day two, Alex is trying to make a fire out of his femurs.

3502
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:34,080
Owen's trying to light a fire with Owen's feet.

3503
02:38:34,080 --> 02:38:38,280
Now I heard that you can use whale fat, so maybe you can use Owen fat.

3504
02:38:38,280 --> 02:38:42,240
Owen was warned spiritually when I said that I would eat my neighbors.

3505
02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:44,120
So cosmically this is okay.

3506
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:45,120
It's cool.

3507
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:51,040
I think that there is such an amazing potential in my brain for, like, what this looks like

3508
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:52,040
in the real world.

3509
02:38:52,040 --> 02:38:53,040
Alex isn't going to do this.

3510
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:54,040
No, obviously not.

3511
02:38:54,040 --> 02:38:58,200
If he did this, he would stay at a hotel nearby and show up and yell in a bull horn every

3512
02:38:58,200 --> 02:38:59,200
now and again.

3513
02:38:59,200 --> 02:39:01,240
He would never stay.

3514
02:39:01,240 --> 02:39:03,840
It's not going to be over 40 degrees until March.

3515
02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:04,840
Nope, nope, nope.

3516
02:39:04,840 --> 02:39:05,840
Not gonna happen.

3517
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:06,840
DC.

3518
02:39:06,840 --> 02:39:07,840
Average temperatures.

3519
02:39:07,840 --> 02:39:08,840
Low.

3520
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:09,840
It's cold.

3521
02:39:09,840 --> 02:39:10,840
It's winter.

3522
02:39:10,840 --> 02:39:12,840
He's not going to go out there and camp out at the Lincoln Memorial?

3523
02:39:12,840 --> 02:39:14,720
He doesn't believe this shit.

3524
02:39:14,720 --> 02:39:15,720
Nope.

3525
02:39:15,720 --> 02:39:16,720
Nope.

3526
02:39:16,720 --> 02:39:17,720
But I would love it.

3527
02:39:17,720 --> 02:39:18,720
I would love it.

3528
02:39:18,720 --> 02:39:19,720
I would...

3529
02:39:19,720 --> 02:39:20,720
I...

3530
02:39:20,720 --> 02:39:21,720
Man, I wish I was a millionaire.

3531
02:39:21,720 --> 02:39:23,800
If I was a millionaire, here's what I would do.

3532
02:39:23,800 --> 02:39:24,800
What would you do?

3533
02:39:24,800 --> 02:39:26,960
I would say, Alex, giant donation.

3534
02:39:26,960 --> 02:39:28,900
But you have to do this.

3535
02:39:28,900 --> 02:39:31,000
You have to yourself.

3536
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:32,380
Not any of your staff.

3537
02:39:32,380 --> 02:39:36,400
You have to stay out there as long as this encampment lasts.

3538
02:39:36,400 --> 02:39:41,960
And much like maybe some MTV show from the early 2000s, you get paid more the longer

3539
02:39:41,960 --> 02:39:42,960
you stay out there.

3540
02:39:42,960 --> 02:39:43,960
I like it.

3541
02:39:43,960 --> 02:39:44,960
And all on camera.

3542
02:39:44,960 --> 02:39:45,960
Yeah.

3543
02:39:45,960 --> 02:39:46,960
Because I want to see your misery.

3544
02:39:46,960 --> 02:39:47,960
Yeah.

3545
02:39:47,960 --> 02:39:53,000
I want to see you camping out fucking pissed off at three in the morning so mad that only

3546
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,680
2,000 people showed up to your encampment.

3547
02:39:55,680 --> 02:39:57,280
This needs to be fat bear.

3548
02:39:57,280 --> 02:40:03,280
There needs to be 24-7 live streams of everybody like making wagers and shit.

3549
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:04,760
Like this should all be...

3550
02:40:04,760 --> 02:40:07,900
This should be on Bet365 daily.

3551
02:40:07,900 --> 02:40:09,440
This is what I'm talking about though.

3552
02:40:09,440 --> 02:40:16,240
Like I probably would not go for the sake of safety and just responsibility in the present

3553
02:40:16,240 --> 02:40:17,960
world we live in.

3554
02:40:17,960 --> 02:40:22,500
Under ideal circumstances, I would love to go and make a documentary about this.

3555
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:28,880
The best I could do is if he actually does this and they actually have feeds, fuck, I

3556
02:40:28,880 --> 02:40:32,880
might be tempted to do nonstop coverage of it.

3557
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:34,740
Like waiting for him to break.

3558
02:40:34,740 --> 02:40:35,740
But he wouldn't break.

3559
02:40:35,740 --> 02:40:37,460
It would be so disappointing.

3560
02:40:37,460 --> 02:40:41,500
It would end up being like two minutes of Alex yelling in a bullhorn and then Harrison

3561
02:40:41,500 --> 02:40:43,840
Smith in the studio or some shit.

3562
02:40:43,840 --> 02:40:49,000
And there'd be an excuse for why he has to leave right away so he wouldn't lose all face.

3563
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Family stuff.

3564
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Yeah, totally.

3565
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Totally.

3566
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Yep.

3567
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:54,000
All of a sudden COVID will be real.

3568
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:59,040
This is just another time, and it sucks because we've done this enough, that it's another

3569
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:04,640
time that I see this amazing potential in what could come and it's not going to.

3570
02:41:04,640 --> 02:41:06,760
I'm preemptively disappointed in it.

3571
02:41:06,760 --> 02:41:09,160
I know it's not going to be great.

3572
02:41:09,160 --> 02:41:13,920
I remember it's the same thing I felt like the second time I heard there was a marathon.

3573
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:21,300
The first time, I thought like, oh my god, 12 hours, he's gonna be gassed by hour three.

3574
02:41:21,300 --> 02:41:24,160
And then it's like, oh, hour three, David Knight's hosting.

3575
02:41:24,160 --> 02:41:26,080
Oh no.

3576
02:41:26,080 --> 02:41:28,480
And then the second time I'm like, it's not gonna be good.

3577
02:41:28,480 --> 02:41:31,160
Now I'm just like a caravan fucked me.

3578
02:41:31,160 --> 02:41:32,160
Everything just sucks.

3579
02:41:32,160 --> 02:41:35,000
Alex going to Georgia sucked.

3580
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:40,720
I might have to write a song about Alex camping out in DC.

3581
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:42,000
Now here's the problem.

3582
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:49,960
When we make a show about an exhaustive failure who fails exhaustively all of the time, it's

3583
02:41:49,960 --> 02:41:52,880
hard for us to expect him to succeed.

3584
02:41:52,880 --> 02:41:54,720
But you kind of have to always...

3585
02:41:54,720 --> 02:41:58,400
Yeah, you always hope Charlie Brown's going to kick that fucking ball, man.

3586
02:41:58,400 --> 02:42:03,640
You have to come in with a little optimism or else, you know, it's a slog.

3587
02:42:03,640 --> 02:42:07,880
Otherwise, then you'll never try and kick the ball again.

3588
02:42:07,880 --> 02:42:11,560
So I beg you, Alex, please.

3589
02:42:11,560 --> 02:42:12,560
Do it.

3590
02:42:12,560 --> 02:42:13,560
Do it.

3591
02:42:13,560 --> 02:42:14,560
Do it.

3592
02:42:14,560 --> 02:42:15,560
You'll save America.

3593
02:42:15,560 --> 02:42:17,560
We will create a documentary for free.

3594
02:42:17,560 --> 02:42:22,200
You will save America single-handedly if you camp out at the Lincoln Memorial through the

3595
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:23,200
winter.

3596
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:25,760
And if you eat fish and try and get as fat as possible.

3597
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:26,760
Yeah.

3598
02:42:26,760 --> 02:42:27,760
Come on.

3599
02:42:27,760 --> 02:42:28,760
That's so good.

3600
02:42:28,760 --> 02:42:29,760
Yeah.

3601
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:33,520
So we have one last clip here and it's a caller who's threatening to shut down Biden

3602
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:34,520
inauguration.

3603
02:42:34,520 --> 02:42:35,520
Okay.

3604
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:36,520
Okay.

3605
02:42:36,520 --> 02:42:38,320
He's going real deep right now.

3606
02:42:38,320 --> 02:42:41,560
I see him doing something major before.

3607
02:42:41,560 --> 02:42:44,960
I mean, he'll probably wait until their fake inauguration of Biden.

3608
02:42:44,960 --> 02:42:48,760
It ain't going to be in DC because we're going to shut that down.

3609
02:42:48,760 --> 02:42:51,440
They're probably going to do it in California or New York City.

3610
02:42:51,440 --> 02:42:52,440
It's going to be something.

3611
02:42:52,440 --> 02:42:56,120
Listen, I need everybody out there to understand me because I'm a major target.

3612
02:42:56,120 --> 02:43:00,560
I'm not trying to act fancy pants, but let me tell you, I put my ass on the line, my

3613
02:43:00,560 --> 02:43:01,560
skin of the game.

3614
02:43:01,560 --> 02:43:02,560
Okay.

3615
02:43:02,560 --> 02:43:03,560
I'm going to be there on the 12th.

3616
02:43:03,560 --> 02:43:04,560
I want people there.

3617
02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:06,520
And I'm going to be there on the 20th come hell or high water.

3618
02:43:06,520 --> 02:43:10,160
So you got my commitment and they told me, don't you show your ass back in DC.

3619
02:43:10,160 --> 02:43:11,160
Well, I'm coming.

3620
02:43:11,160 --> 02:43:13,040
And so you go ahead and do whatever you want.

3621
02:43:13,040 --> 02:43:14,760
Now that's what God wants.

3622
02:43:14,760 --> 02:43:15,760
He strike me down.

3623
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:17,320
I'll become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

3624
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:18,800
The quote Obi Wan Kenobi.

3625
02:43:18,800 --> 02:43:20,120
You don't get to quote the Jedis.

3626
02:43:20,120 --> 02:43:21,120
No, no, no.

3627
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:22,120
You're the bad guy.

3628
02:43:22,120 --> 02:43:23,880
Remember your favorite guy is literally the emperor.

3629
02:43:23,880 --> 02:43:24,880
Yeah.

3630
02:43:24,880 --> 02:43:25,880
You don't get to do that.

3631
02:43:25,880 --> 02:43:26,880
That's not fair.

3632
02:43:26,880 --> 02:43:27,880
Jerk.

3633
02:43:27,880 --> 02:43:33,560
See, now that would be, that would be acceptable on his, uh, I'm joining the dark side episode

3634
02:43:33,560 --> 02:43:35,480
where he quotes Obi Wan the whole time.

3635
02:43:35,480 --> 02:43:36,600
Yeah, that would make sense.

3636
02:43:36,600 --> 02:43:43,660
And he comes into the show with just swelling strings out.

3637
02:43:43,660 --> 02:43:44,660
That would be fitting.

3638
02:43:44,660 --> 02:43:45,660
Yeah.

3639
02:43:45,660 --> 02:43:46,660
That'd be great.

3640
02:43:46,660 --> 02:43:48,720
So I don't think Alex is going to follow through with this.

3641
02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:51,160
I think he's going to go do some publicity stunts in DC.

3642
02:43:51,160 --> 02:43:55,840
He said he's going to be there on the 12th, which is when that rally he's going to co-opt

3643
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:56,840
is.

3644
02:43:56,840 --> 02:43:57,840
Yeah.

3645
02:43:57,840 --> 02:43:59,040
The 20th inauguration.

3646
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:02,880
I could see him going to that as well and trying to cause a scene.

3647
02:44:02,880 --> 02:44:05,120
But when would the, when would the camping be?

3648
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:06,120
Would it be on the 12th?

3649
02:44:06,120 --> 02:44:09,560
Would it start on the 12th and then go through the inauguration because that's what it should

3650
02:44:09,560 --> 02:44:10,560
be.

3651
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:11,560
Set up a goddamn Zephyr.

3652
02:44:11,560 --> 02:44:12,560
No chance.

3653
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:15,160
Get out there and broadcast from the Lincoln Memorial.

3654
02:44:15,160 --> 02:44:20,680
He eats more sandwiches in a day than he will spend hours on that mall.

3655
02:44:20,680 --> 02:44:21,680
This makes me sad.

3656
02:44:21,680 --> 02:44:25,880
I want it to happen and I'm not going to allow myself to believe that it's not going to happen

3657
02:44:25,880 --> 02:44:26,880
yet.

3658
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:27,880
There's a chance.

3659
02:44:27,880 --> 02:44:28,880
Yes.

3660
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:29,880
There's always the chance.

3661
02:44:29,880 --> 02:44:30,880
Hope springs eternal.

3662
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:35,080
It's still Schrodinger's occupation at this point, so we will see.

3663
02:44:35,080 --> 02:44:36,800
Until we're allowed to observe it.

3664
02:44:36,800 --> 02:44:37,800
Yeah.

3665
02:44:37,800 --> 02:44:41,000
And another thing that's Schrodinger's, we have Schrodinger's Monday's episode.

3666
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Oh, that's true.

3667
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:43,000
It could be a Rogan episode.

3668
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:44,000
Could be.

3669
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Could not be.

3670
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Could be.

3671
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,000
At this point, it is both.

3672
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:48,000
It is.

3673
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:52,480
It is simultaneously an episode about Rogan and not and you'll have to tune in on Monday

3674
02:44:52,480 --> 02:44:53,480
to find out.

3675
02:44:53,480 --> 02:44:55,760
That sounds like something I would hear on the Joe Rogan show.

3676
02:44:55,760 --> 02:44:56,760
Head exploding.

3677
02:44:56,760 --> 02:45:00,080
It is both at the same time.

3678
02:45:00,080 --> 02:45:01,080
Yeah.

3679
02:45:01,080 --> 02:45:04,320
Also, how about, I can't remember what his sponsors were.

3680
02:45:04,320 --> 02:45:05,320
Damn it.

3681
02:45:05,320 --> 02:45:07,480
Wasn't there a toilet one, Schwifty?

3682
02:45:07,480 --> 02:45:09,040
No, that's Rick and Morty.

3683
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:10,040
I don't remember.

3684
02:45:10,040 --> 02:45:11,040
Flushie.

3685
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:12,040
Flushie.

3686
02:45:12,040 --> 02:45:13,040
No, Tushie.

3687
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:14,040
Who knows.

3688
02:45:14,040 --> 02:45:16,440
Anyway, we'll be back, Jordan, but until then, we have a website.

3689
02:45:16,440 --> 02:45:17,440
We do have a website.

3690
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:18,440
It's knowledgefight.com.

3691
02:45:18,440 --> 02:45:19,440
You bet.

3692
02:45:19,440 --> 02:45:20,440
We're also on Twitter.

3693
02:45:20,440 --> 02:45:21,440
We are on Twitter.

3694
02:45:21,440 --> 02:45:23,120
It's at Knowledge Dungeon Door Fight and at Go To Bed Jordan.

3695
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:24,120
Yep.

3696
02:45:24,120 --> 02:45:25,120
We're also on Facebook.

3697
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:27,760
We are on Facebook.

3698
02:45:27,760 --> 02:45:31,080
If you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

3699
02:45:31,080 --> 02:45:32,080
doing God's work.

3700
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:33,080
Yep.

3701
02:45:33,080 --> 02:45:34,080
We'll be back.

3702
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:35,080
But until then, I'm Neo.

3703
02:45:35,080 --> 02:45:36,080
I'm Leo.

3704
02:45:36,080 --> 02:45:37,080
I'm DZXClark.

3705
02:45:37,080 --> 02:45:38,080
I'm Daryl Rundis.

3706
02:45:38,080 --> 02:45:40,880
I'm a North Korean ballot tugboat captain.

3707
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:41,880
Andy in Kansas.

3708
02:45:41,880 --> 02:45:42,880
You're on the air.

3709
02:45:42,880 --> 02:45:43,880
Thanks for holding.

3710
02:45:43,880 --> 02:45:44,880
Hello, Alex.

3711
02:45:44,880 --> 02:45:45,880
I'm a first time caller.

3712
02:45:45,880 --> 02:45:46,880
I'm a huge fan.

3713
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:47,880
I love your work.

3714
02:45:47,880 --> 02:45:55,480
I love you.
