N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
Knowledgefight.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
I need, I need money.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Stop it.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
It's time to pray.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Thanks for holding.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Hello Alex, I'm a first-time caller.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm a huge fan.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
I love your work.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Knowledgefight.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
N-N-N-N-N-Knowledgefight.com.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
I love you.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm Dan.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm Jordan.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
We're couple dudes that like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
bit about Alex Jones.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Oh, indeed we are Dan.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Jordan.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Dan!

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Jordan.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I have a quick question for you.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
What's up?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
What's your bright spot today?

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
My bright spot might be a little bit disappointing, but it's again Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
I've been taking my time playing it casually.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
One of the things that I found really interesting about the game is without giving any spoilers

01:27.000 --> 01:36.000
or anything, I find myself playing this game and having more moral choices than I have

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
in a lot of other games in the past.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
That's fair.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
And part of it is there are choices that you can make that I'm almost certain will not

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
affect the game at all.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Sure, sure.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
But I feel bad about it.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
They affect you.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Yes, absolutely.

01:51.000 --> 02:01.000
I don't know if it's just that I have not been exposed to games that do that well in

02:01.000 --> 02:08.160
the past, but I feel a lot more like these little things that you run into when you're

02:08.160 --> 02:09.160
exploring around the world.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.160
Sure, totally.

02:10.160 --> 02:13.200
It's a little thing like you can rip somebody off if you want to and no one will ever know,

02:13.200 --> 02:14.200
but you'll know.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.200
You will know.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.200
Yeah.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.200
Absolutely.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.200
I enjoy that.

02:18.200 --> 02:23.320
It's one of those situations in the game where I realized like later on I had just finished

02:23.320 --> 02:27.560
a quest and later on I was playing another one and I was like, I feel bad about what

02:27.560 --> 02:29.120
I did to that guy.

02:29.120 --> 02:33.400
I think it was the right thing to do, but you know what, it doesn't make me feel good.

02:33.400 --> 02:37.080
You failed the test, bro.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.080
So I enjoy that.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.200
It makes the gameplay a little more fun.

02:40.200 --> 02:47.400
And especially because I want to give a bright spot to Age of Calamity, the Hyrule Warriors,

02:47.400 --> 02:48.400
but I just can't.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.400
You just can't.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.400
Disappointed?

02:50.400 --> 02:54.640
I started dabbling in it a little bit because, you know, I can't not.

02:54.640 --> 02:55.640
Sure.

02:55.640 --> 02:56.960
Apparently I'm a gamer bro now.

02:56.960 --> 02:57.960
That's what happened.

02:57.960 --> 02:58.960
That's what happened.

02:58.960 --> 02:59.960
It happened so quick.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.280
You can't go outside and all of a sudden we're gamer gators.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.280
Yeah.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.280
It took two seconds.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.280
I didn't say gamer gators.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.280
No, I'm pretty sure that's what you said.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.280
I said I'm a gamer bro.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.280
I know.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.280
I'm just kidding.

03:09.280 --> 03:12.760
I guess my feeling on it is it's fun.

03:12.760 --> 03:17.040
The Age of Calamity is fun and if anybody enjoys it, I don't think you're wrong too.

03:17.040 --> 03:23.600
I just kind of had expectations of more of a Dynasty Warriors-esque game and that itch

03:23.600 --> 03:24.600
wasn't scratched.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.600
Oh, that's unfortunate.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.600
Or it hasn't been.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.120
But it's still fun for what it is.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.120
So I can't give it a bright spot.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.560
Gotta keep it on the moral choices.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.440
Stay the course with Valhalla.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.220
How about you?

03:37.220 --> 03:38.220
Maybe adjacent.

03:38.220 --> 03:41.240
Dan, I went to a board game store.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.240
Oh yeah.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.240
Uh huh.

03:43.240 --> 03:44.240
It was very exciting.

03:44.240 --> 03:49.880
We had played together a board game called Mysterium, which I found very enjoyable.

03:49.880 --> 03:50.880
So I was like, you know what?

03:50.880 --> 03:53.080
I think I'm going to get into cooperative board games.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.480
I'm going to find all those.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.560
We're going to play them together.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.980
It's going to be fantastic.

03:56.980 --> 03:58.600
So I went to a board game store.

03:58.600 --> 04:03.280
Guy who is very, very helpful knew everything about board games and card games and the assorted

04:03.280 --> 04:04.280
like.

04:04.280 --> 04:07.280
And I was like, hey, I need some help getting a board game.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.680
I'm just starting to get into this.

04:08.680 --> 04:12.080
And he was like, okay, this one is super accessible.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.960
It's called Mansions of Badness.

04:14.960 --> 04:15.960
Brought it home.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.760
There's like 4,000 pieces.

04:17.760 --> 04:21.680
You need a companion app for a god damn iPad.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.600
There's damage rolls and shit.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.360
There's a whole thing on it.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.640
And I was like, this is very exciting.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.480
I don't think we're ever going to play that.

04:29.480 --> 04:30.840
I don't think we're ever going to play that.

04:30.840 --> 04:34.040
And accessible is a different definition, but I'm very excited about it.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.720
Well, now that you've brought it up, people are going to want us to play it on a, like

04:36.720 --> 04:37.720
a live stream or something.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.800
I don't know if we're going to be able to do that.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.800
Probably not.

04:40.800 --> 04:41.800
But that is fun.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.200
If you're looking for a board game, they're a lot of fun.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.200
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.200
Yeah, for sure.

04:45.200 --> 04:51.320
So, Jordan, today I've got something I'm looking forward to, and that is a nutty ass show from

04:51.320 --> 04:52.320
Alex.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.320
I like it.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.120
Today we're going to be going over December 1st and 2nd, 2020.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.600
I'm Dan, this is 2020.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.600
Oh, hooray!

04:58.600 --> 05:01.680
That is Tuesday and Wednesday this week.

05:01.680 --> 05:05.340
And I was going to, look, here's the deal.

05:05.340 --> 05:11.780
As I was getting this episode ready, we record on Thursdays, and on Thursday, Alex dropped

05:11.780 --> 05:16.000
a big episode with him and Joe Rogan in the Info Wars studio.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Of course.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Of course.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.840
And of course, this rises the bat signal.

05:22.840 --> 05:28.840
But it doesn't quite rise it in the same way as Alex being on Rogan's show, because it's

05:28.840 --> 05:31.240
probably not going to be nearly as interesting.

05:31.240 --> 05:32.240
No.

05:32.240 --> 05:36.100
I don't care about Joe Rogan being interviewed by somebody.

05:36.100 --> 05:40.760
What does he have to say that I'm going to be interested in from an interview perspective?

05:40.760 --> 05:44.720
Alex is interesting- What's it like having a hundred million dollars?

05:44.720 --> 05:50.080
Alex is interesting on Rogan because he's desperately trying to steal Rogan's audience,

05:50.080 --> 05:54.560
and he's trying to impress upon them that he knows things, and that he is a guru they

05:54.560 --> 05:57.000
should follow away from Joe.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Exactly.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.160
Joe being on Info Wars is not that interesting.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.600
Joe's probably just going to be like, ha ha, remember when we wore those masks, and ran

06:04.600 --> 06:05.600
around Austin?

06:05.600 --> 06:06.600
100.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.600
We're such friends.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.600
Yeah.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.600
I don't know.

06:09.600 --> 06:15.240
Whereas, whereas Alex being on Rogan requires an emergency episode, we got to get ahead

06:15.240 --> 06:16.240
of that thing.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.240
Yeah.

06:17.240 --> 06:18.440
This, I don't fucking know.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.320
I don't know if anyone will care.

06:20.320 --> 06:23.360
I don't think, this is a tree falling in a forest and no one's there.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.360
Yeah, I know.

06:24.360 --> 06:25.600
I don't know if that makes a sound.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.120
Did you hear about it beforehand?

06:27.120 --> 06:28.120
No?

06:28.120 --> 06:32.400
I am going to listen to it, and if it's worthwhile, it'll be our episode for Monday.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.400
For sure.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.440
And if it's not, then we'll just see what's going on now.

06:35.440 --> 06:36.440
Find something else.

06:36.440 --> 06:37.440
It's just a regular show.

06:37.440 --> 06:41.640
I know that by the time this episode is out, people might be aware of the fact that Rogan

06:41.640 --> 06:43.980
did a four fucking hour episode with Alex.

06:43.980 --> 06:45.720
What an asshole.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.080
So we'll see on that.

06:47.080 --> 06:51.880
But before we get down to business on today's episode, which, like I said, a lot of fun.

06:51.880 --> 06:52.880
Okay.

06:52.880 --> 06:53.880
There's a lot of...

06:53.880 --> 06:54.880
I'm excited.

06:54.880 --> 06:55.880
Stupid, stupid shit.

06:55.880 --> 06:56.880
I'm excited.

06:56.880 --> 06:57.880
I'm excited.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.000
We got to take a little moment first, though, to thank some folks who have signed up and

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
are supporting the show.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Oh, that's a good idea.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
So first, Jeff A., thank you so much.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.400
You are now a policy wonk.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.520
I'm a policy wonk.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.520
Thanks, Jeff.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.000
Next, Dexter K., thank you so much.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.460
You are now a policy wonk.

07:09.460 --> 07:10.560
I'm a policy wonk.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.620
Thank you very much, Dexter.

07:11.620 --> 07:12.620
Thank you.

07:12.620 --> 07:15.000
Next, Jordan looks exactly like I imagined but Dan doesn't.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Thank you so much.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
You are now a policy wonk.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.080
I'm a policy wonk.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.120
Thank you very much.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.120
Thank you.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.580
Next, Joe P. Thank you so much.

07:21.580 --> 07:22.880
You're now a policy wonk.

07:22.880 --> 07:23.940
I'm a policy wonk.

07:23.940 --> 07:24.940
Thank you, Joe.

07:24.940 --> 07:25.940
Thank you.

07:25.940 --> 07:26.940
Next, Joseph JP.

07:26.940 --> 07:27.940
Thank you so much.

07:27.940 --> 07:28.940
You are now a policy wonk.

07:28.940 --> 07:29.940
I'm a policy wonk.

07:29.940 --> 07:30.940
Thank you very much, Joseph.

07:30.940 --> 07:31.940
Thank you.

07:31.940 --> 07:32.940
Next, Emily W. Thank you so much.

07:32.940 --> 07:34.520
You are now a policy wonk.

07:34.520 --> 07:35.520
I'm a policy wonk.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.520
Thanks Emily!

07:36.520 --> 07:37.520
Thank you!

07:37.520 --> 07:38.520
Next Thomas S!

07:38.520 --> 07:39.520
Guess what?

07:39.520 --> 07:40.520
What?

07:40.520 --> 07:41.520
You're a policy wonk.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.520
I'm a policy wonk!

07:42.520 --> 07:43.520
Thanks Thomas!

07:43.520 --> 07:45.760
And finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on Elevated

07:45.760 --> 07:46.760
Level.

07:46.760 --> 07:47.760
We appreciate that very much.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.280
So first, David M. Thank you so much.

07:49.280 --> 07:50.800
You are now a technocrat.

07:50.800 --> 07:54.120
And your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.120
Thank you so much.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.120
You are now a technocrat.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.120
I'm a policy wonk.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.120
Crikey mate, that's fantastic.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.120
Have yourself a brew.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.120
How's your 401k doing, bro?

08:00.120 --> 08:04.400
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright?

08:04.400 --> 08:05.920
Let's just get down to business.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.000
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.920
Why you pimps so good?

08:09.920 --> 08:11.560
My neck is freakishly large.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.160
I declare info war on you.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.120
Thank you so much Dave and thank you so much your mother was a hamster and your father

08:17.120 --> 08:18.120
smelt of elderberries.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.680
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

08:19.680 --> 08:22.000
If you are out there and you're thinking, hey I enjoy the show, I'd like to support

08:22.000 --> 08:24.920
these gents too, you can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com, clicking

08:24.920 --> 08:26.960
the button that says support the show, or...

08:26.960 --> 08:32.320
What you could do is you could gather two to five of your friends, ages three and up,

08:32.320 --> 08:38.480
put together a nice little night every week to get together, read the rule book, find

08:38.480 --> 08:43.960
out, yeah well absolutely socially distance responsibly, get the rule book, by which I

08:43.960 --> 08:49.680
mean find some local charities or bail funds in your area to help out and then get all

08:49.680 --> 08:51.160
your friends together and get it done.

08:51.160 --> 08:52.160
Knocked it out of the park.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.160
Thank you.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.160
Nailed it.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.160
Thank you.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.560
So real quick before we get going with the actual episode, we gotta take a look at the

08:57.560 --> 08:58.560
mail bags.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.560
Yep.

08:59.560 --> 09:05.120
And in here we got a nice little thing from Cassandra S. Jordan, you have a little box

09:05.120 --> 09:06.120
in front of you.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.120
Yes, I do.

09:07.120 --> 09:12.560
Cassandra sent me a Alex Jones coloring book, which I will try to pretend does not exist,

09:12.560 --> 09:15.760
because it's supposed to be, I mean coloring books are for kids, right?

09:15.760 --> 09:16.760
Right, right, right, right.

09:16.760 --> 09:17.760
This is terrifying.

09:17.760 --> 09:21.200
There are adult coloring books now, that's a phenomenon that people enjoy.

09:21.200 --> 09:25.760
I think I have a Cthulhu coloring book, and that's probably not for kids, but Alex seems

09:25.760 --> 09:26.760
more horrifying.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.120
It's not for boring kids.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.280
Oh, this is intense.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.480
Elliot's espresso nib peanut butter.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.120
Nut butter's grown up.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.120
This is intense.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.120
Whoa.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.840
This is, do you see the coloring and everything on this?

09:39.840 --> 09:40.840
Yeah, yeah.

09:40.840 --> 09:44.040
It looks like you got peanut butter, chocolate, and espresso?

09:44.040 --> 09:45.040
And espresso, yeah.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.040
That's a weird butter.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.040
It looks like that's what's going on.

09:47.040 --> 09:50.280
Oh yeah, it looks like you have to shake it up, oh man, oh man.

09:50.280 --> 09:56.100
I feel like you have some reticence about sort of extravagant butter.

09:56.100 --> 10:02.640
You know, I'm excited to taste this, here's the problem that I'm seeing with this, it's

10:02.640 --> 10:03.640
not even distribution.

10:03.640 --> 10:04.960
I think you just gotta stir it.

10:04.960 --> 10:09.600
I think you're right, but it's looking like there's just weird black chunks at the bottom.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.560
Yeah, those are like cocoa pieces, or espresso.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.560
Cocoa nibs.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.560
Cocoa, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.560
I'm excited, I'm gonna try it.

10:15.560 --> 10:16.560
It looks delicious.

10:16.560 --> 10:17.560
I look forward to a full report.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.560
It looks delicious.

10:18.560 --> 10:19.560
Thank you so much, Cassandra.

10:19.560 --> 10:20.560
Yes, thank you very much.

10:20.560 --> 10:23.400
Alright, so here we go, we're jumping in.

10:23.400 --> 10:28.520
December 1st, Alex opens the show with a video from the night before.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.520
Okay.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.840
He had some big breaking news, and he had to get down to it.

10:31.840 --> 10:38.280
It's Monday night, we've been working on this story for two weeks, and now the whistleblower

10:38.280 --> 10:42.680
has given us the authorization to go forward with the information you are about to see.

10:42.680 --> 10:47.760
This is the first report, and several we're gonna be breaking with the documents if MSM

10:47.760 --> 10:50.680
challenges this in any way.

10:50.680 --> 10:53.200
This is such a perfect way for Alex to do business.

10:53.200 --> 10:57.000
I love this so much because of how painfully transparent it is.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.040
I don't even know, and I don't need to know what this is about, or what this alleged whistleblower

11:02.040 --> 11:05.200
is claiming, because I know how this is set up.

11:05.200 --> 11:10.200
This isn't how this kind of journalism works, you know, when it's being done sincerely.

11:10.200 --> 11:14.160
If there actually was a whistleblower, and there actually were documents that proved

11:14.160 --> 11:18.400
whatever it is they're claiming, it would be all released as a story.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.920
The documents would be provided to help give credibility to the claims that the whistleblower

11:21.920 --> 11:26.000
was making, because otherwise it's just a person making claims that you aren't really

11:26.000 --> 11:27.840
able to fully assess.

11:27.840 --> 11:28.840
Think about it.

11:28.840 --> 11:33.360
In any conceivable world, can you imagine Glenn Greenwald meeting with Snowden, then

11:33.360 --> 11:36.920
announcing that he has a whistleblower who's ready to make a bunch of claims, and if anybody

11:36.920 --> 11:39.600
challenges them, that's when the documents come?

11:39.600 --> 11:40.600
It's fucking absurd.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.760
I think it's a great idea, you keep it in your plus two bag of holding until you need

11:44.760 --> 11:45.760
it.

11:45.760 --> 11:46.760
Nonsense.

11:46.760 --> 11:47.760
It makes perfect sense.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.200
They never would have acted like that because they had documents, and they had a story.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.800
That did help them, yeah.

11:51.800 --> 11:56.120
Without knowing anything about this whistleblower or the claims, I refuse to believe that anyone

11:56.120 --> 11:59.840
would behave this way, unless this was an incredibly desperate bluff.

11:59.840 --> 12:04.640
If we are challenged on it, if we are challenged on it, what does that even mean?

12:04.640 --> 12:05.640
Quantify that.

12:05.640 --> 12:09.880
If somebody says, hey, what are you talking about, they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

12:09.880 --> 12:10.880
whoa, that's not a challenge.

12:10.880 --> 12:15.160
If you have a story, you'd never hold back the thing that proves your story, promising

12:15.160 --> 12:17.520
to release it only if you have to.

12:17.520 --> 12:21.560
That's schoolyard bully or entry level extortionist shit.

12:21.560 --> 12:25.560
I will tell you guys about Deep Throat the moment someone asks, but until then, you just

12:25.560 --> 12:26.560
gotta believe it.

12:26.560 --> 12:31.120
Also, this goes entirely against Alex's entire career's guiding principle.

12:31.120 --> 12:34.960
He's often told guests that if they have information, they have to get it all out or else they're

12:34.960 --> 12:36.920
putting themselves at risk.

12:36.920 --> 12:40.920
Alex constantly says that his guests don't tell him anything off air, they don't say

12:40.920 --> 12:45.580
on air, because he doesn't want to have secret information that other people know he has,

12:45.580 --> 12:47.560
since that's when things get dangerous.

12:47.560 --> 12:48.560
Exactly.

12:48.560 --> 12:53.520
Having secrets is okay and it's too late once you've already spilled a secret, but having

12:53.520 --> 12:57.720
people know that you know a secret and that you haven't said anything puts a target on

12:57.720 --> 12:58.720
your back.

12:58.720 --> 12:59.720
Dangerous, dangerous.

12:59.720 --> 13:00.920
This is the gate of gates all over again.

13:00.920 --> 13:05.000
This is exactly what happened back in 2011 when Alex interviewed Bob Chapman.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.920
Bob implied that he had secret intel on Ronald Reagan, which Alex insisted he needed to say

13:08.920 --> 13:13.720
on air now because he said that he had these secrets and he was in danger if he didn't

13:13.720 --> 13:15.240
get it out in the open.

13:15.240 --> 13:18.920
Then Bob said that he'd seen a video of Reagan getting pegged and Alex got weirded out and

13:18.920 --> 13:21.840
disappointed that it wasn't something more communist.

13:21.840 --> 13:26.320
Getting on air and saying that he has proof he'll produce if pushed back on is anathema

13:26.320 --> 13:29.380
to Alex's entire career's methodology.

13:29.380 --> 13:33.840
It's not anathema to a really sadly broken idiot trying to bluff that he has a bombshell

13:33.840 --> 13:38.920
story that's actually a dud, and I say that knowing nothing.

13:38.920 --> 13:43.980
I could tell you that without knowing any other thing about where this clip goes.

13:43.980 --> 13:46.360
Show me Reagan getting pegged and then I'll believe you.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.360
The end.

13:47.360 --> 13:51.380
So, um, I was like, alright, I don't give a shit.

13:51.380 --> 13:54.520
Like you could have said, he could have said anything afterwards and I would have been

13:54.520 --> 13:59.160
disappointed because it's like if you start by saying like we have all the proof and if

13:59.160 --> 14:04.280
Brian Stelter tries to get Mauvey with me I'll release the proof.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.280
I'll do it.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.280
No.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.160
Well then why not release it now?

14:09.160 --> 14:10.160
Right.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.060
Does he address that at all?

14:12.060 --> 14:14.040
Why he's waiting for someone to challenge it?

14:14.040 --> 14:15.040
I think he likes to be tricky.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.040
Oh, okay.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.040
He likes to set traps.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.040
It's just a little fun.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.040
Yeah.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.040
Okay.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.040
No, it's because he has nothing.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.040
Oh, okay.

14:22.040 --> 14:28.280
Anyway, this is about, uh, actually, let's see, do you think you can guess?

14:28.280 --> 14:32.300
Do I think I can guess what the whistleblower whose documents might be coming out, and this

14:32.300 --> 14:33.680
would have been Sunday night.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.120
Uh, no, Monday night.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.120
Monday night.

14:36.120 --> 14:42.520
Um, uh, I want to say it's got something to do with Michigan.

14:42.520 --> 14:43.520
Okay.

14:43.520 --> 14:44.520
That's interesting.

14:44.520 --> 14:45.520
That's what I'm going to go with.

14:45.520 --> 14:54.480
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a major health executive over a 35 hospital network in Western

14:54.480 --> 15:02.240
Pennsylvania that is exposing the fact that COVID-19 is a completely overblown power grab

15:02.240 --> 15:03.240
scam.

15:03.240 --> 15:08.960
Now we received this information directly from this whistleblower, checked out their

15:08.960 --> 15:14.200
credentials and that was just the beginning of how insane this got.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.200
Yeah.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.200
I was surprised too.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.200
I really thought this would be something election related.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.200
Yeah.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.200
Yep.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.200
This is a little disappointing.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.200
Yeah.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.560
I didn't re I mean, I kind of, kind of forgot that Alex is spinning multiple plates.

15:23.560 --> 15:24.560
Yeah.

15:24.560 --> 15:29.080
Um, so yeah, I was, I was caught on my, uh, on my back heel as they say when it was like,

15:29.080 --> 15:30.720
Oh, this is a COVID thing.

15:30.720 --> 15:35.640
It's almost, uh, yeah, it's, it's almost kind of ridiculous that people are still denying

15:35.640 --> 15:36.640
COVID.

15:36.640 --> 15:37.640
Yep.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.960
I mean, it's not almost kind of, it's insanely ridiculous.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.680
It was ridiculous before.

15:41.680 --> 15:46.400
But it also seems like this isn't what the season is on your show, Alex.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.480
It seems like this is kind of what I was thinking.

15:48.480 --> 15:54.360
It seems like you got bigger issues opening the show with this 79 days of hell and we're

15:54.360 --> 15:55.360
doing okay.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.360
Yeah.

15:56.360 --> 16:01.680
So, uh, it gets to talking about this whistleblower here and, uh, this is kind of, I don't, I

16:01.680 --> 16:03.360
don't think I believe this.

16:03.360 --> 16:07.560
This individuals involved in the management of 35 hospital network in Western Pennsylvania.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.720
The UPMC is the name of the company.

16:10.720 --> 16:15.240
UPMC stands for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the network actually includes

16:15.240 --> 16:17.280
more than 35 hospitals.

16:17.280 --> 16:21.500
Their website includes 36 hospital campuses, but they also have a satellite hospitals around

16:21.500 --> 16:22.500
that they manage.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.600
But, uh, you know, that are, they're included in the network.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.600
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

16:25.600 --> 16:29.320
The other line about UPMC is that it is a giant entity.

16:29.320 --> 16:32.880
Their board of directors and executive team are all publicly listed and I would definitely

16:32.880 --> 16:37.360
try and track down who Alex is talking about, but I'm sure it's not someone on that level.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.760
And I just, I started to listen to this.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.480
I'm like, you got these documents you're never going to fucking produce.

16:42.480 --> 16:45.160
You're going to forget this even happened in a week.

16:45.160 --> 16:49.420
I'm not going to amplify the disappointment by trying to figure out which name on this

16:49.420 --> 16:51.760
list you're trying to allude to.

16:51.760 --> 16:55.920
I'm not going to read the chicken bones that I've thrown down on the ground.

16:55.920 --> 16:59.960
Yeah, yeah, I think that's, uh, I think you should have to ignore that entirely.

16:59.960 --> 17:05.960
He has, for you to engage with it, he must produce one document that you can research.

17:05.960 --> 17:09.120
Otherwise, he's trying to get around you specifically.

17:09.120 --> 17:13.240
I've gone, I've gone so far as to find a list of names of the people he's pretending this

17:13.240 --> 17:15.280
is and that's good enough for me for now.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.280
That's, that's too much work.

17:17.280 --> 17:18.720
You're, you're giving him too much credit.

17:18.720 --> 17:25.440
Well, let's actually hear what this, uh, almost certainly fake person has to say.

17:25.440 --> 17:31.000
During the latest so-called surge of COVID-19 where they claim the hospitals are all overwhelmed,

17:31.000 --> 17:37.000
we've got to have a lockdown again, they went from 96 beds to around 600.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.160
That is only 10% of the capacity they have just for COVID-19 and their hospitals are

17:43.160 --> 17:44.960
basically wide open.

17:44.960 --> 17:51.040
And here's the most important point, no deaths of the 600 people.

17:51.040 --> 17:55.160
Most patients stayed overnight for observation because they tested positive.

17:55.160 --> 18:00.840
Media will say hospitalization patients have surged over 600%, but it's the test that's

18:00.840 --> 18:08.160
been turned up 45 times and German courts have ruled that it is a fake test 96% of the

18:08.160 --> 18:09.160
time.

18:09.160 --> 18:13.720
So Alex is reading off a bit of an Info Wars article there, but he's also just making up

18:13.720 --> 18:15.860
a lot of stuff and throwing it in.

18:15.860 --> 18:20.360
Here are the parts of that clip that do not even appear in the Info Wars article about

18:20.360 --> 18:21.840
this whistleblower.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.940
And one can only presume Alex is just saying these things to try and imply or associate

18:25.940 --> 18:30.080
them with the whistleblower, which is incredibly irresponsible.

18:30.080 --> 18:34.280
This whistleblower article says nothing about anyone saying all the hospitals are overwhelmed.

18:34.280 --> 18:38.360
The circumstances would obviously be different in different areas where there are varying

18:38.360 --> 18:44.120
rates of infection that lead to hospitalization and varying levels of available medical resources.

18:44.120 --> 18:49.560
This article does not say that this 600 beds represents 10% of the hospital's capacity.

18:49.560 --> 18:55.440
According to the American Hospital Directory, the hospitals that are listed as part of UPMC,

18:55.440 --> 18:58.840
they add up to having 7,371 beds.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.320
But the number that's cited in the blurbs, some that I can find about the network are

19:02.320 --> 19:04.960
8,000, which I think is probably reasonable.

19:04.960 --> 19:05.960
Sure, sure, sure.

19:05.960 --> 19:09.400
It would actually be less than 10% of that capacity, but it's kind of a meaningless

19:09.400 --> 19:13.920
statistic to discuss this way, as we don't, you know, we have any information about the

19:13.920 --> 19:16.480
distribution of the needed beds.

19:16.480 --> 19:21.740
We don't know where the beds are at various hospitals, nor do we know how many of these

19:21.740 --> 19:26.600
beds are ICU beds, or airborne isolation beds.

19:26.600 --> 19:31.680
According to TribLive, as of November 20th, there were 17% availability on the latter

19:31.680 --> 19:35.040
bed type, which is enough to worry people.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.040
Yeah.

19:36.040 --> 19:39.880
This is not something that can be easily captured by simple statistic, but that's what Alex

19:39.880 --> 19:45.280
is trying to do, which is, you know, also in addition to the article, like it's not

19:45.280 --> 19:46.280
in there.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.280
The 10% of their beds.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:48.280 --> 19:52.360
I don't know if he's making that up, or, I don't know, it doesn't appear to be coming

19:52.360 --> 19:53.360
from his whistleblower.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.360
A alleged whistleblower.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.360
Let's see what happens.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.360
Why not toss it in there?

19:56.360 --> 20:00.400
As for the no deaths thing among 600 hospitalized individuals, I would be interested in seeing

20:00.400 --> 20:01.680
proof of that.

20:01.680 --> 20:07.640
Pittsburgh is an Allegheny County, and on Tuesday, the day this is coming out, 18 people

20:07.640 --> 20:09.960
died with COVID-19 in that county.

20:09.960 --> 20:14.840
But UPMC has hospitals in other counties, too, which also have registered deaths.

20:14.840 --> 20:19.360
I just don't know anything about this claim, and I just would need to see whatever documents

20:19.360 --> 20:20.360
Alex has withheld.

20:20.360 --> 20:22.000
So I guess I challenge it.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.880
Yeah, yeah, I suppose that's the only thing you can do?

20:24.880 --> 20:26.960
Yeah, I'm not MSM, but...

20:26.960 --> 20:29.960
Okay, we challenge you to produce the documents.

20:29.960 --> 20:30.960
And a thumb war.

20:30.960 --> 20:31.960
Is that what we say?

20:31.960 --> 20:32.960
Is that all I have?

20:32.960 --> 20:33.960
Yeah.

20:33.960 --> 20:34.960
Ah.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.880
The stuff about the test being turned up 45 times does not appear in the article about

20:37.880 --> 20:42.560
this whistleblower, and it seems to be Alex is putting words in their mouth.

20:42.560 --> 20:46.080
Similar things, I could say, about the nonsense about the German courts.

20:46.080 --> 20:50.000
What Alex is doing here is he's taking a very boring supposed whistleblower claim and then

20:50.000 --> 20:52.840
riffing on it to make it seem more bombshell.

20:52.840 --> 20:56.800
If you read the actual article on this, all the person appears to be claiming is that

20:56.800 --> 21:02.720
the hospitalization in the UPMC system went up from 96 to 600 beds that were occupied

21:02.720 --> 21:06.240
during this last period that's being characterized as a surge.

21:06.240 --> 21:10.960
No specific data is given about these patients, just that, quote, patients were kept in observation

21:10.960 --> 21:13.680
overnight and no deaths resulted.

21:13.680 --> 21:17.620
This is nonspecific to the point of being meaningless, but Pennsylvania has a database

21:17.620 --> 21:21.800
where you can find all the information about county-level hospital bed availability, which

21:21.800 --> 21:24.160
can give you a sense of the picture if you want.

21:24.160 --> 21:31.000
In the last available report, in the entirety of the state, there are 4,290 adult ICU beds

21:31.000 --> 21:32.500
total.

21:32.500 --> 21:37.920
Of those, 695 are available, which is 16%.

21:37.920 --> 21:42.080
This is not to say, I mean, there's other, you know, you could look at the other statistics

21:42.080 --> 21:43.800
too that you want, but there's one.

21:43.800 --> 21:49.560
There's 16% of ICU beds are available in the entire state of Pennsylvania.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.040
I can't stress this enough.

21:51.040 --> 21:55.180
This is not a whistleblower delivering meaningful information, and if you read on through the

21:55.180 --> 21:58.760
Infowars article about this, you kind of see what's going on.

21:58.760 --> 22:04.140
Quote, if you start with 5 patients to 25, the media will say there's a 500% increase

22:04.140 --> 22:05.320
in cases.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.760
Sounds terrifying, right?

22:07.760 --> 22:11.320
This article is essentially Infowars trying to explain how numbers work to their audience

22:11.320 --> 22:15.360
while also trying to make them distrustful and suspicious about percentage signs.

22:15.360 --> 22:21.120
Sure, a 600% increase sounds scary, but it could just be like 20 more people, so who

22:21.120 --> 22:22.120
cares?

22:22.120 --> 22:23.480
It's no big deal.

22:23.480 --> 22:28.120
But this line of argumentation is really not good, because a jump from 5 cases somewhere

22:28.120 --> 22:30.920
to 25 would definitely be a bad sign.

22:30.920 --> 22:37.660
I don't know if you remember what the numbers were like early on in the coronavirus days,

22:37.660 --> 22:42.080
but if there had been a jump like that in February, people would rightly have been worried

22:42.080 --> 22:43.220
about it.

22:43.220 --> 22:47.920
And if you're in a small town, let's say, that has 5 cases right now, and tomorrow there's

22:47.920 --> 22:49.600
25, that would be a big deal.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.600
That's a real problem.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.980
And it would definitely be an indication of deep community transmission.

22:53.980 --> 22:58.380
What Alex is attempting to do here is make this reality of rising COVID cases and hospitalizations

22:58.380 --> 23:02.960
not worry his audience by taking the numbers and shrinking them.

23:02.960 --> 23:07.360
It's baffling, really, because even for Alex, this is a little insulting to his audience's

23:07.360 --> 23:08.520
intelligence.

23:08.520 --> 23:13.580
This is him banking on them not feeling really talked down to by bringing in a fake whistle

23:13.580 --> 23:16.360
blower to explain how percentages work.

23:16.360 --> 23:20.280
This is really elementary stuff, and it's kind of degrading.

23:20.280 --> 23:24.000
I don't think highly of his audience either, but this is insulting.

23:24.000 --> 23:30.020
Hey, if you only take the first few little bits of a logarithmic scale, it looks not

23:30.020 --> 23:31.100
scary at all.

23:31.100 --> 23:34.920
It's the last part of the parabola, if you just ignore the last part of the parabola

23:34.920 --> 23:37.440
where it goes, real fast.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.440
Sure.

23:38.440 --> 23:39.440
Then you're going to be fine.

23:39.440 --> 23:40.440
Yeah.

23:40.440 --> 23:41.440
Ah, numbers.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.440
You don't have to worry about them.

23:42.440 --> 23:48.320
Well, I mean, a 500% increase could be one to five, or it could be a lot more.

23:48.320 --> 23:53.280
Wow, you can't prove that, though.

23:53.280 --> 23:57.240
I don't even know what kind of charade is being-

23:57.240 --> 23:58.760
Okay, all right, let's start here.

23:58.760 --> 24:03.200
If you multiply two by two, that's so much, but that's only four.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.120
And then if you multiply that by two, that seems like a lot, but that's only eight.

24:06.120 --> 24:09.160
And then if you multiply that by two, that's 16, and that is quite a bit more.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.240
And then if you multiply that by two, it's 32.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.840
And then it's 64, and then it's 128.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.480
Holy shit, man!

24:15.480 --> 24:16.480
Yeah.

24:16.480 --> 24:18.560
So Alex keeps on going on.

24:18.560 --> 24:22.040
This has nothing to do with the whistleblower, but he's just now, I guess, attacking the

24:22.040 --> 24:24.240
idea of testing.

24:24.240 --> 24:28.320
You've seen the big reports about the famous female CEO that had a test that could find

24:28.320 --> 24:32.480
cancer in your blood, and it was incredible, and they made hundreds of billions of dollars,

24:32.480 --> 24:34.720
and it turned out it was all a scam.

24:34.720 --> 24:40.760
That's what this PCR scam is, and the inventor of it came out and said just that.

24:40.760 --> 24:43.040
So a couple of things real quick.

24:43.040 --> 24:48.320
Carey Mullis, the inventor of the PCR test, died on August 7th, 2019.

24:48.320 --> 24:53.400
He did not come out and say anything about the PCR test for COVID-19 being a fraud, which

24:53.400 --> 24:55.680
is what Alex is trying to imply.

24:55.680 --> 25:00.840
So here is the clip that Alex immediately after plays of comments that Carey Mullis

25:00.840 --> 25:01.840
has made.

25:01.840 --> 25:08.080
If they could find this virus in you at all, and with PCR, if you do it well, you can find

25:08.080 --> 25:10.440
almost anything in anybody.

25:10.440 --> 25:14.840
It starts making you believe in the sort of Buddhist notion that everything is contained

25:14.840 --> 25:15.840
and everything else, right?

25:15.840 --> 25:20.880
I mean, because if you can amplify one single molecule up to something that you can really

25:20.880 --> 25:27.720
measure, which PCR can do, then there's just very few molecules that you don't have at

25:27.720 --> 25:29.760
least one single one of them in your body, okay?

25:29.760 --> 25:34.080
So that could be thought of as a misuse of it just to claim that it's meaningful.

25:34.080 --> 25:37.500
So that's the entire clip that Alex plays of Mullis.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.640
This comment is out of context.

25:39.640 --> 25:44.120
It's from a question and answer session that Mullis did about using PCR testing to detect

25:44.120 --> 25:47.120
HIV back in 1993.

25:47.120 --> 25:51.680
A lot of the stuff sounds applicable to the current pandemic, but it's really not.

25:51.680 --> 25:58.160
The most damning you could make this quote out to be is to understand that maybe Mullis

25:58.160 --> 26:02.920
was expressing that this form of test isn't good for determining the quantity of something

26:02.920 --> 26:06.300
in somebody, rather it detects the presence or absence of it.

26:06.300 --> 26:10.960
You could do that, I guess, but it's important to understand the context of these comments

26:10.960 --> 26:14.760
that he was making, though, because it sounds like what he's saying is that if you look

26:14.760 --> 26:18.600
at people, you can find any disease in them, but that's not the case.

26:18.600 --> 26:23.240
He's talking about HIV patients and specifically about how if you have that virus, there's

26:23.240 --> 26:27.120
a good chance you may have others and maybe many others.

26:27.120 --> 26:32.760
He literally says that almost exactly after where Alex cuts the clip off.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.640
You don't need to test for HIV.

26:34.640 --> 26:39.680
You don't need to test for the other 10,000 retroviruses that are unnamed also in the

26:39.680 --> 26:40.680
subject.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.560
See, somebody that's got HIV generally is going to have almost anything that you can

26:44.560 --> 26:49.760
test for because they have definitely been, HIV is a fairly rare virus.

26:49.760 --> 26:54.140
At the beginning of Alex's clip, Mullis says if they find this virus in you at all with

26:54.140 --> 26:58.440
PCR, if you do it well, you can find almost anything and anybody.

26:58.440 --> 27:02.580
It's selectively edited to make it sound like Mullis is saying that using PCR, doctors can

27:02.580 --> 27:04.600
find any virus in anyone.

27:04.600 --> 27:09.280
In its proper context, which Alex deprives the audience of, it's clear that the virus

27:09.280 --> 27:13.860
that he's referring to, so when he says if they can find this virus in you at all, he's

27:13.860 --> 27:20.280
talking about HIV and his contention that if you can find HIV in a person, his contention

27:20.280 --> 27:24.080
is that you can find most viruses, probably.

27:24.080 --> 27:29.240
Also not to get too far off track here, but Carey Mullis, though the inventor of PCR testing,

27:29.240 --> 27:33.480
is not someone who's remembered super well in the field of HIV and AIDS, as he was a

27:33.480 --> 27:37.600
denialist of the conclusion that HIV causes AIDS.

27:37.600 --> 27:38.600
Fair, fair.

27:38.600 --> 27:42.560
The point that's relevant to our situation though today is that Alex's clip that he's

27:42.560 --> 27:47.520
using of Mullis to attack the use of PCR for COVID-19 testing is completely out of context

27:47.520 --> 27:49.340
and doesn't mean anything.

27:49.340 --> 27:53.840
The complaint that Alex is making about PCR testing here isn't about COVID-19 specifically,

27:53.840 --> 27:58.100
it's about the entirety of PCR as a testing method, and he's expecting the audience to

27:58.100 --> 28:04.600
believe that the inventor of PCR testing, who won a Nobel Prize for the discovery, has

28:04.600 --> 28:08.600
said that it doesn't actually do anything to find anything in anybody with it, ha ha!

28:08.600 --> 28:09.600
It's a little bit rich.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.360
I would assume he said that after he got the Nobel.

28:12.360 --> 28:16.800
I don't think part of your campaign for the Nobel is, honestly, this thing doesn't do

28:16.800 --> 28:17.800
shit at all.

28:17.800 --> 28:18.800
I dunked on you fools!

28:18.800 --> 28:24.760
What did you say at the end, sir, tricked ya, ha ha!

28:24.760 --> 28:25.760
Surprise!

28:25.760 --> 28:28.680
I'd like to thank the Nobel board for being so fucking dumb.

28:28.680 --> 28:32.840
I think the thing that...

28:32.840 --> 28:33.840
That's quite an acceptance speech.

28:33.840 --> 28:34.840
Bunch of morons.

28:34.840 --> 28:40.020
I just, I think the problem that I have is that he didn't tell me that the video was

28:40.020 --> 28:41.020
from 93.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.020
Sure.

28:42.020 --> 28:46.400
Like, if you tell me anything about any testing, like, if this is from 93...

28:46.400 --> 28:48.000
I mean, it's 27 years old.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.760
If it happened before an iPhone, then I don't know if I can use it.

28:52.760 --> 28:53.760
I don't care yet.

28:53.760 --> 28:54.760
Yeah.

28:54.760 --> 28:55.760
You know what I'm saying?

28:55.760 --> 28:56.760
Well, yes and no.

28:56.760 --> 28:57.760
No.

28:57.760 --> 28:58.760
It's not perfect.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.400
It's not like the way anybody should live their lives.

29:00.400 --> 29:05.760
But if you're talking about PCR testing in 2020 versus something that Akai said before

29:05.760 --> 29:08.720
the iPhone happened, I kind of think that I don't care.

29:08.720 --> 29:09.720
Sure.

29:09.720 --> 29:10.720
You know?

29:10.720 --> 29:11.720
Yeah.

29:11.720 --> 29:14.320
If you are using science from when grunge was king...

29:14.320 --> 29:15.320
Yeah!

29:15.320 --> 29:19.720
Yeah, if science hasn't advanced since then, we're in trouble.

29:19.720 --> 29:20.720
Yeah.

29:20.720 --> 29:27.840
If counting crows were cool when this science was around, I'm not interested.

29:27.840 --> 29:28.900
It's a long November.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.360
So Alex is playing this...

29:31.360 --> 29:32.360
It is November.

29:32.360 --> 29:33.360
Good stuff.

29:33.360 --> 29:34.360
Thanks, bud.

29:34.360 --> 29:35.360
This is my November.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.360
This is my December.

29:36.360 --> 29:37.360
Damn it.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.360
That's a Linkin Park song.

29:38.360 --> 29:42.800
Anyway, Alex is playing this special report of his, and he just cuts off in the middle

29:42.800 --> 29:43.800
of it.

29:43.800 --> 29:48.200
They're banning medical doctors and epidemiologists, virologists, and scientists who come out and

29:48.200 --> 29:55.280
point all this out because they want to use this hysteria...

29:55.280 --> 29:56.280
For what?

29:56.280 --> 29:57.280
What do they want to use the hysteria for?

29:57.280 --> 30:02.400
I was overwhelmed because this episode started with him talking about this giant whistleblower

30:02.400 --> 30:07.180
who has the documents that they'll be revealed if anybody flexes, and then he just cuts off

30:07.180 --> 30:08.180
in the middle.

30:08.180 --> 30:09.180
I'm like, wait a second.

30:09.180 --> 30:10.180
Maybe that wasn't important.

30:10.180 --> 30:11.180
Yeah.

30:11.180 --> 30:12.180
Maybe that was filler.

30:12.180 --> 30:15.160
I guess that sounds a little bit like he didn't really care about that.

30:15.160 --> 30:19.000
Maybe I got tricked into researching filler.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.800
You got Nobel prized, my friend.

30:20.800 --> 30:23.800
Yeah, I was like, oh, wait a second.

30:23.800 --> 30:24.800
All right.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.440
So anyway, Alex is just late for the show.

30:26.440 --> 30:28.040
Okay, of course.

30:28.040 --> 30:29.560
But apparently you're supposed to take that seriously.

30:29.560 --> 30:30.560
Sure.

30:30.560 --> 30:31.560
There is a whistleblower.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.560
But it...

30:32.560 --> 30:33.560
Okay.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.560
And he got cut off in the middle because Alex finally showed up to the office.

30:35.560 --> 30:36.560
Sure.

30:36.560 --> 30:37.560
He was busy.

30:37.560 --> 30:38.560
Oh, okay.

30:38.560 --> 30:42.600
He's been waiting for this broadcast since 6 a.m. this morning.

30:42.600 --> 30:45.400
And the news is so massive, so over the top, so dangerous.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.400
But what about the whistleblower?

30:46.400 --> 30:49.400
He wasn't able to go on until 12 minutes into the transmission.

30:49.400 --> 30:51.440
That was five minutes ago.

30:51.440 --> 30:52.440
Yeah.

30:52.440 --> 30:57.720
So, okay, Alex had to take the first 12 minutes off because he was so busy working on this

30:57.720 --> 30:58.720
news.

30:58.720 --> 30:59.720
Since 6 a.m.

30:59.720 --> 31:00.720
Yep.

31:00.720 --> 31:04.000
He was so busy that he had to distract me with another gigantic bombshell story.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.480
A huge bombshell story.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.600
Unfortunately, we can't spend any time on it.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.880
No, because this other story is the biggest news ever.

31:09.880 --> 31:10.880
Way bigger.

31:10.880 --> 31:13.320
We've talked about things that Project Veritas has broken.

31:13.320 --> 31:15.120
We've talked about things that Breitbart's broken.

31:15.120 --> 31:17.040
We've talked about things Tucker Carlson has broken.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.760
All of which are the world.

31:18.760 --> 31:21.760
When they do big things to say they've broken the biggest thing ever.

31:21.760 --> 31:27.620
This isn't about credit, but I have to tell you, we are breaking information on this show

31:27.620 --> 31:36.360
today that is the biggest thing ever broken concerning this fraudulent election and what

31:36.360 --> 31:37.360
happened.

31:37.360 --> 31:41.880
This is the number one biggest, go to bed, James O'Keefe.

31:41.880 --> 31:48.560
But I really feel like the whole Germany's courts invalidating all testing as 96% fraud.

31:48.560 --> 31:51.600
I think that's a way bigger story than any election.

31:51.600 --> 31:54.520
There are people dying around the world, millions of them.

31:54.520 --> 31:59.960
I mean, Alex would make that argument on another day, but he was late because he was working

31:59.960 --> 32:01.480
on this gigantic scoop.

32:01.480 --> 32:02.480
That's fair.

32:02.480 --> 32:03.480
I messed up.

32:03.480 --> 32:11.640
This thing is going really crazy on the 1st because there's, you know, Trump's attorney

32:11.640 --> 32:16.320
Lin Wood is going batty talking about how Trump needs to declare martial law.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.320
No, doing great.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.320
Doing great.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.320
Lawyers, that's what you want them saying.

32:19.320 --> 32:24.320
Sidney Powell and Rudy are going buck wild.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.320
They're fantastic.

32:25.320 --> 32:28.680
No, I'm glad they're getting paid a lot of money.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.800
Just a lot of nutty stuff is happening.

32:30.800 --> 32:34.920
So I wasn't sure what this big news Alex had to break was literally any could be.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.960
I thought this was it, but it's not.

32:36.960 --> 32:42.040
But I found this clip incredibly charming, but let me just drop it on you right now.

32:42.040 --> 32:49.440
Infowars.com live show feed headline must watch Tuesday live.

32:49.440 --> 32:51.640
That's got a typo, but that's okay.

32:51.640 --> 32:58.680
Top lawyers advise Trump to declare martial law, hold new election and that headline just

32:58.680 --> 33:08.200
went out minutes ago, my typo, myself, let's get that fixed, please.

33:08.200 --> 33:11.640
Some quaint about it, but I appreciate it.

33:11.640 --> 33:14.320
Yeah, that's, that's, uh, he knows that he did that.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.320
Yeah.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.320
He knows that that was his typo.

33:16.320 --> 33:17.320
You know what?

33:17.320 --> 33:18.320
Can't get too mad about it.

33:18.320 --> 33:22.840
You guys, somebody please fix that, please, uh, makeup.

33:22.840 --> 33:26.760
If it was, if it was someone else's fault, I'd lose my shit and kill everybody here.

33:26.760 --> 33:30.680
Well, he wouldn't be super furious, but he'd also be telling you how not mad he was.

33:30.680 --> 33:35.680
There's something kind of quaint about just him being like, there's a typo there.

33:35.680 --> 33:40.480
Yeah, that is a, that's one of those small refreshing human moments where you're like,

33:40.480 --> 33:41.480
you know what?

33:41.480 --> 33:42.480
At least you got that one.

33:42.480 --> 33:46.520
I am about to get on air and talk about how it actually is really cool that Trump is being

33:46.520 --> 33:48.480
told to declare martial law.

33:48.480 --> 33:49.480
Sure.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.040
Shit, I made a typo there.

33:51.040 --> 33:55.560
It's like when a tweet goes viral and it's got a typo in it, I go, no, never take it

33:55.560 --> 33:56.560
back.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.000
I'll never take it back.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.680
Now it's been screenshotted.

33:59.680 --> 34:04.240
It's interesting because you're talking about this human moment there and I think that one

34:04.240 --> 34:09.760
of the things that made this episode and the content we were going to get into particularly

34:09.760 --> 34:15.240
like it like kind of, I don't know, elevated to me a little bit is there's a little bit

34:15.240 --> 34:16.880
of pathos in here.

34:16.880 --> 34:17.880
Okay.

34:17.880 --> 34:21.120
There's a little bit like I don't, I don't want to make you or the audience or anybody

34:21.120 --> 34:28.200
feel any kind of pity or sympathy or empathy for Alex of as a, you know, as an actor in

34:28.200 --> 34:34.520
this world at all, but I think that there's a, there's a point in this December 1st episode

34:34.520 --> 34:39.160
where you can't help but feel like, God damn, this is sad.

34:39.160 --> 34:41.400
Hey, we all still appreciate Macbeth.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.760
He wasn't a good guy, but we can feel the pathos of his choices.

34:44.760 --> 34:45.760
Sure.

34:45.760 --> 34:46.760
Sure.

34:46.760 --> 34:48.400
There is a tragedy to this episode.

34:48.400 --> 34:49.400
That's what I'm saying.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.400
Yeah.

34:50.400 --> 34:53.360
And it all begins in this next clip.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.360
Then there's this story.

34:55.360 --> 35:03.360
I hired a respected security firm that's done security research for the army and other groups

35:03.360 --> 35:15.000
to dig in when I was asked by the White House to investigate it three weeks ago into Dominion

35:15.000 --> 35:17.520
and it being owned by the Chai-Coms.

35:17.520 --> 35:19.280
We got the proof.

35:19.280 --> 35:24.880
We checked it with the SEC, confirmed it two days ago, and we now publish the findings

35:24.880 --> 35:25.880
at infowars.com.

35:25.880 --> 35:31.320
Firm that owns Dominion voting systems received 400 million from a Swiss bank account with

35:31.320 --> 35:34.800
connection to Chinese government before election.

35:34.800 --> 35:38.000
Oh, that's a, that's a scandal.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.240
There's a lot going on in there and I really enjoyed it because this like for, it's been

35:42.240 --> 35:45.120
a while, but it felt like this is really a conspiracy I could dig into.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.120
Okay.

35:46.120 --> 35:47.120
Okay, good.

35:47.120 --> 35:51.760
So the company that owns Dominion, uh, they got a bunch of money from the Chinese government

35:51.760 --> 35:52.760
or something.

35:52.760 --> 35:53.760
Sure.

35:53.760 --> 35:54.760
This is amazing.

35:54.760 --> 35:58.520
In these kinds of cases, the first thing I like to do is I like to go to Infowars and

35:58.520 --> 36:01.440
see what the, uh, the articles there actually say.

36:01.440 --> 36:06.780
And actually this was an instance, literally unlike any that I think I've ever encountered.

36:06.780 --> 36:12.740
And that's because this article includes links to five PDF documents that are apparently

36:12.740 --> 36:14.360
used to prove their case.

36:14.360 --> 36:15.360
Wait, five?

36:15.360 --> 36:16.360
I've never seen proof.

36:16.360 --> 36:17.360
Five?

36:17.360 --> 36:18.360
Yes.

36:18.360 --> 36:19.360
Five?

36:19.360 --> 36:20.360
I've never seen-

36:20.360 --> 36:21.520
Not one link to a zero hedge.

36:21.520 --> 36:24.080
I've never seen embedded like documents.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.080
Full on docs.

36:25.080 --> 36:26.080
Crazy.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.080
Okay.

36:27.080 --> 36:30.300
Four of them are apparently SEC documents that have the following disclaimer on top

36:30.300 --> 36:31.560
of them in big letters.

36:31.560 --> 36:36.580
Wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee

36:36.580 --> 36:37.580
it's a good paper.

36:37.580 --> 36:41.600
Quote, the Securities and Exchange Commission has not necessarily reviewed the information

36:41.600 --> 36:44.940
in this filing and is not determined if it's accurate and complete.

36:44.940 --> 36:48.760
The reader should not assume that the information is accurate and complete.

36:48.760 --> 36:52.720
I don't hear any difference between what you read and what I said.

36:52.720 --> 36:53.720
Yeah.

36:53.720 --> 36:54.720
They're very similar.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.040
This is not a good start.

36:56.040 --> 36:57.580
So that's four of them.

36:57.580 --> 37:01.060
And the fifth is a link that goes to a Reuters article.

37:01.060 --> 37:06.280
This is not great in terms of documents, but there was another problem that immediately

37:06.280 --> 37:07.960
jumped out at me.

37:07.960 --> 37:13.380
The article begins with this sentence, quote, an investigation into SEC filings has revealed

37:13.380 --> 37:19.160
that the firm which owns Dominion Voting Systems received $400 million from a Swiss bank with

37:19.160 --> 37:23.680
close links to the Chinese government less than a month before the election.

37:23.680 --> 37:28.080
In that clip we just heard, Alex said that the White House had asked him to look into

37:28.080 --> 37:33.000
this three weeks ago, and then he hired a firm to do the research.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.760
Where it all falls apart is there, there's an editor's note at the end of the article.

37:37.760 --> 37:39.760
They've got to get rid of the thing.

37:39.760 --> 37:44.260
Quote, a previous version of this article incorrectly credited a particular research

37:44.260 --> 37:46.880
firm for performing this investigation.

37:46.880 --> 37:51.200
That information was erroneous, and this article has been updated to correct that.

37:51.200 --> 37:52.680
We apologize for the confusion.

37:52.680 --> 37:56.000
Okay, so the research firm was not involved whatsoever.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Well, that's certainly getting confusing now, isn't it?

37:58.000 --> 37:59.480
Yeah, it does seem to be that way.

37:59.480 --> 38:02.340
This is amazing, and it definitely indicates a problem.

38:02.340 --> 38:06.920
An archived copy of this article from Before the Correction credits the investigation to,

38:06.920 --> 38:10.360
quote, Austin Security and Investigation Solutions.

38:10.360 --> 38:14.180
This is a real company, but based on their website, they don't appear to be a research

38:14.180 --> 38:15.180
firm.

38:15.180 --> 38:18.520
They're more like the kind of people you get to do an unofficial stakeout, or help you

38:18.520 --> 38:19.840
make court filings.

38:19.840 --> 38:20.840
Okay.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.640
Maybe, like when Alex had people following his wife around.

38:23.640 --> 38:24.640
Right, right, right.

38:24.640 --> 38:29.080
So it's the type of place that also sells nanny cams if you're in the store, they've

38:29.080 --> 38:32.400
got some stuff for you, and they're like, oh, we'll do a little freelance investigation.

38:32.400 --> 38:36.000
If you suspect someone's cheating, maybe you have them stake out their apartment or something.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
What's their type of deal?

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
I don't know.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Yeah, they're hard-boiled detectives, Dan.

38:39.000 --> 38:43.120
The only thing I can conclude is that either Alex is making up that some group did this

38:43.120 --> 38:48.840
research to make it seem more official, or he needed this company's help to find SEC

38:48.840 --> 38:52.560
filings, and then he tried to credit them for the conclusions he arrived at, and they

38:52.560 --> 38:54.680
told him, keep our name off this shit.

38:54.680 --> 38:55.680
That sounds right.

38:55.680 --> 39:01.720
I'm not going to address the reality or falsity of any of the claims about this conspiracy

39:01.720 --> 39:03.360
while I explain it to you.

39:03.360 --> 39:04.360
Okay.

39:04.360 --> 39:05.360
Just for the sake of simplicity.

39:05.360 --> 39:10.580
According to Alex, Dominion is owned by a company called Staple Street Capital.

39:10.580 --> 39:15.200
This group received $400 million from a company called UBS Securities.

39:15.200 --> 39:20.240
UBS Securities is a Swiss investment bank that also owns a company called UBS Securities

39:20.240 --> 39:25.240
Company Limited, which is an investment bank that caters to the Chinese market.

39:25.240 --> 39:30.140
UBS owns approximately 25% of this Chinese investment bank, with the Chinese government

39:30.140 --> 39:35.120
being the other owner through a number of other entities.

39:35.120 --> 39:40.400
So the conspiracy here is that the parent company of Dominion got some money from a

39:40.400 --> 39:45.080
Swiss investment bank which also owns a separate bank which the Chinese government is heavily

39:45.080 --> 39:46.080
invested in.

39:46.080 --> 39:47.080
Okay.

39:47.080 --> 39:51.600
Even if every step of this is true and no one screwed up or fudged any of the details,

39:51.600 --> 39:53.220
it still doesn't prove anything.

39:53.220 --> 39:56.760
This is not a meaningful connection between Dominion and China.

39:56.760 --> 40:00.760
Unfortunately, someone screwed up or fudged some details.

40:00.760 --> 40:05.420
For one, this article on Infowars claims that Staple Street Capital, quote, acquired Dominion

40:05.420 --> 40:07.680
Voting Systems in 2018.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.920
This is kind of imprecise.

40:09.920 --> 40:14.520
On July 16th, 2018, it was announced that Dominion Voting Systems, quote, has been acquired

40:14.520 --> 40:17.840
by its management team and Staple Street Capital.

40:17.840 --> 40:22.520
This was partially an acquisition, but not in the same way as them, like, outright buying

40:22.520 --> 40:23.520
Dominion.

40:23.520 --> 40:24.920
It was more of like a partnering and a deep investment.

40:24.920 --> 40:25.920
Sure, sure, sure.

40:25.920 --> 40:29.480
A little bit of a merger plus venture capital kind of mix up there.

40:29.480 --> 40:30.480
It's in that territory.

40:30.480 --> 40:31.480
Yeah.

40:31.480 --> 40:36.520
Second, second, the article mentions that, quote, on October 8th, 2020, Staple Street

40:36.520 --> 40:43.720
Capital filed SEC Form D offerings and sales amount of $400 million with the sales compensation

40:43.720 --> 40:47.160
recipient identified as UBS Securities.

40:47.160 --> 40:51.900
This is meant to imply that UBS Securities paid Staple Street $400 million to use Dominion

40:51.900 --> 40:57.660
to steal the election, but the reality is that Form D with the SEC is used to report

40:57.660 --> 40:59.760
on the sale of securities.

40:59.760 --> 41:04.160
I hate to sound like I don't think $400 million is a lot of money, but when you're

41:04.160 --> 41:09.180
in the investment market, it's not really that much to a company like Staple Street.

41:09.180 --> 41:12.640
It's definitely not enough to pay them to rig a fucking election.

41:12.640 --> 41:14.920
That's a comically low amount for that kind of work.

41:14.920 --> 41:19.640
And also, I would assume they'd do the payoff more than a month before the election.

41:19.640 --> 41:20.640
Seems, seems weird.

41:20.640 --> 41:21.640
Timing?

41:21.640 --> 41:22.640
I don't know about that.

41:22.640 --> 41:26.480
Yeah, but you know, every time you see these people get bribed, I keep finding them taking

41:26.480 --> 41:31.840
so little amounts of money for, like, the most- like, I could actually buy somebody

41:31.840 --> 41:38.320
only getting $400 million to steal an election that's worth $20 trillion every day.

41:38.320 --> 41:39.320
I can't.

41:39.320 --> 41:40.320
You know?

41:40.320 --> 41:45.180
Like, I see these people do, oh, we stole $50 million and I got paid $50 grand to my

41:45.180 --> 41:46.360
re-election fund?

41:46.360 --> 41:47.360
Like, that's what they do!

41:47.360 --> 41:48.520
They're insane!

41:48.520 --> 41:53.840
I think that what you're talking about is sort of the, like, boilerplate blase corruption.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.080
Sure.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.280
Not stealing elections.

41:56.280 --> 42:00.080
Okay, that might be a bigger thing than I'm really throwing it out as.

42:00.080 --> 42:01.080
Yeah.

42:01.080 --> 42:07.600
Yeah, I do think that sometimes payoffs for, like, corrupt doing business kind of things

42:07.600 --> 42:09.880
might not be the size that you'd imagine.

42:09.880 --> 42:10.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:10.880 --> 42:12.440
This is a pretty big fucking heist.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.440
It is a bit of a heist, yeah.

42:14.440 --> 42:20.600
Far more likely, this was a payment from UBS Securities for purchasing some equity of investments

42:20.600 --> 42:22.480
that are held by Staples Street.

42:22.480 --> 42:26.400
This does seem to be the case, since in the form that Alex links to from the SEC, it says

42:26.400 --> 42:31.120
that this is, quote, equity, and quote, pooled investment fund interests.

42:31.120 --> 42:34.520
The third problem is probably the one that requires the least fact-checking, but also

42:34.520 --> 42:36.640
is the biggest problem.

42:36.640 --> 42:41.400
Alex wants to confuse his audience and readers about the entities UBS Securities and UBS

42:41.400 --> 42:43.440
Securities Company Limited.

42:43.440 --> 42:48.140
UBS Securities is the one that bought securities from Staples Street, and that's the Swiss

42:48.140 --> 42:49.560
Investment Bank.

42:49.560 --> 42:54.680
UBS Securities Company Limited is the Chinese investment bank co-owned by the Chinese government

42:54.680 --> 42:57.040
and UBS Securities.

42:57.040 --> 43:01.000
UBS Securities Company Limited did not buy securities from Staples Street, but because

43:01.000 --> 43:05.160
the names are so similar, Alex wants the audience to come away with that impression, that the

43:05.160 --> 43:09.960
entity that is part-owned by the Chinese government is the one that's giving the 400 million.

43:09.960 --> 43:11.740
That's not the case at all.

43:11.740 --> 43:15.000
This is why the conclusion to this article is just unearned.

43:15.000 --> 43:19.880
Quote, the revelation that Dominion Voting Systems has financial ties to the Chinese

43:19.880 --> 43:24.620
government via UBS Securities will bolster claims by Trump supporters that foreign actors

43:24.620 --> 43:28.720
working on behalf of Communist China may have sought to meddle in the presidential election

43:28.720 --> 43:30.440
and help Joe Biden.

43:30.440 --> 43:32.680
None of that is demonstrated by the evidence provided.

43:32.680 --> 43:37.160
This is all just paper-thin bullshit Alex is trying to pass off as a smoking gun.

43:37.160 --> 43:38.160
Yeah.

43:38.160 --> 43:44.680
Also, I hate to crash Alex's parade here, or rain on it and crash his party simultaneously.

43:44.680 --> 43:47.720
But this story was not broken by Infowars.

43:47.720 --> 43:51.560
They did a post about it, an article, on December 1st, and good for them.

43:51.560 --> 43:56.060
Unfortunately, this exact conspiracy, using the exact same PDF files from the SEC that

43:56.060 --> 44:01.280
Alex linked to, was going around on QAnon Twitter as early as November 29th.

44:01.280 --> 44:02.280
There we go.

44:02.280 --> 44:05.560
Alex is running around like he's late for the show because of breaking news, but it's

44:05.560 --> 44:08.080
a fucking basil QAnon post.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.080
God damn it.

44:09.080 --> 44:13.480
Alex is just taking bullshit QAnon conspiracies one of his interns finds online, and then

44:13.480 --> 44:18.120
he's pretending that it's the product of an investigation that he hired a firm to do because

44:18.120 --> 44:20.500
the White House asked him to.

44:20.500 --> 44:24.080
This is a pathetic level of insincerity and grift.

44:24.080 --> 44:28.400
When you actually realize what Alex is doing, it becomes really disgusting to think about.

44:28.400 --> 44:33.800
He, as a person, knows that the White House didn't ask him to do this investigation.

44:33.800 --> 44:38.920
He knows that he didn't pay Austin Securities and Investigation Solutions to find these

44:38.920 --> 44:40.400
documents.

44:40.400 --> 44:45.560
That's the backstory that he needs to create to make himself look like a big, strong boy

44:45.560 --> 44:50.760
for his audience, when he might as well just be reading your crazy uncle's Facebook page.

44:50.760 --> 44:53.720
It's really gross to think about.

44:53.720 --> 44:55.680
He knows what he's doing.

44:55.680 --> 45:01.240
Being in that moment where you're so sad that you have to take QAnon posts and pretend that

45:01.240 --> 45:07.400
the fucking White House paid you or insist they got you because you're the best, you're

45:07.400 --> 45:11.680
the bravest around, you're the only person who can get this information out, so we need

45:11.680 --> 45:12.680
you to do it.

45:12.680 --> 45:18.080
So I dug deep in my pockets and I paid the best researchers to find these SEC filings

45:18.080 --> 45:20.160
that you just found on fucking QAnon.

45:20.160 --> 45:21.880
Get the fuck out of here.

45:21.880 --> 45:23.480
It's so sad.

45:23.480 --> 45:30.720
Being that hollow, that weak, in that moment, it's amazing.

45:30.720 --> 45:37.280
He's a little bit like the America's Funniest Home Videos of the Q world now, where he takes

45:37.280 --> 45:41.080
... He takes stuff that you could find on the internet in two seconds that went around

45:41.080 --> 45:45.000
yesterday and packages it in for people who only watch TV.

45:45.000 --> 45:51.800
He's like Tosh.0, but if Tosh was like, I got these from the fucking Chairman Mao himself.

45:51.800 --> 45:56.240
You stumbled onto actually a really good metaphor, and it's why America's Funniest-

45:56.240 --> 45:57.240
Stumbled onto?

45:57.240 --> 46:03.680
Well, it's why America's Funniest Home Videos was a big ratings driver, and something like

46:03.680 --> 46:08.960
Tosh.0 is fine, but whatever, it wasn't that great because the internet did exist.

46:08.960 --> 46:10.840
You could find those videos then.

46:10.840 --> 46:13.880
Back when America's Funniest Home Videos was on, that was the only game in town.

46:13.880 --> 46:14.880
Just like Alex.

46:14.880 --> 46:15.880
Exactly.

46:15.880 --> 46:16.880
There was a time-

46:16.880 --> 46:17.880
But then the internet existed.

46:17.880 --> 46:21.800
There was a time when he was the only person who could provide you with nut shots.

46:21.800 --> 46:29.160
And America's Funniest Home Videos still exists now in much the sad place that Alex Jones

46:29.160 --> 46:30.160
exists.

46:30.160 --> 46:31.160
Yeah.

46:31.160 --> 46:32.160
Brutal.

46:32.160 --> 46:34.800
Yeah, that means QAnon is-

46:34.800 --> 46:35.800
Zagat?

46:35.800 --> 46:36.800
Is Tosh.0?

46:36.800 --> 46:37.800
Is QAnon Bob Zagat?

46:37.800 --> 46:38.800
No.

46:38.800 --> 46:39.800
Just Bob Zagat's later career?

46:39.800 --> 46:40.800
Bob Zagat might actually be QAnon, though.

46:40.800 --> 46:41.800
That might be true.

46:41.800 --> 46:42.800
I'm not entirely sure.

46:42.800 --> 46:43.800
I could buy it.

46:43.800 --> 46:44.800
So Alex-

46:44.800 --> 46:45.800
The Aristocrats.

46:45.800 --> 46:46.800
So now that-

46:46.800 --> 46:53.160
Yeah, The Aristocrats, just the family is telling the story of like, all right, so there's

46:53.160 --> 46:54.160
a cabal.

46:54.160 --> 46:56.680
What do they call the cabal?

46:56.680 --> 46:57.680
The Aristocrats.

46:57.680 --> 46:58.680
The Aristocrats.

46:58.680 --> 46:59.680
All right.

46:59.680 --> 47:05.240
So, Alex is like, this story is not good.

47:05.240 --> 47:06.420
It doesn't work.

47:06.420 --> 47:09.760
The proof that he has doesn't back up the claims.

47:09.760 --> 47:15.820
There isn't like, these documents don't show nefariousness to the level that he's implying.

47:15.820 --> 47:18.440
And it's all just stuff he's cribbing from QAnon.

47:18.440 --> 47:22.480
And he just won't give up this charade that he's on.

47:22.480 --> 47:23.480
This is so huge.

47:23.480 --> 47:29.400
But let me give you the big Infowars exclusive of two big Infowars exclusives that the system

47:29.400 --> 47:37.080
is fighting and battling as hard as it can to make sure it does not get out to anybody.

47:37.080 --> 47:43.840
Firm that owns Dominion Voting Systems received 400 million from Swiss Bank with connection

47:43.840 --> 47:46.320
to Chinese government before election.

47:46.320 --> 47:49.840
So yeah, man, they're trying to keep this under wraps.

47:49.840 --> 47:50.840
Oh boy.

47:50.840 --> 47:52.880
It's Infowars exclusives.

47:52.880 --> 47:56.720
Now when Alex is going over the story, it's interesting because I guess he hasn't got

47:56.720 --> 47:58.040
the memo.

47:58.040 --> 48:04.160
The investigation conducted by Austin Security and Investigation Solutions centers on Staples

48:04.160 --> 48:05.560
Street Capital.

48:05.560 --> 48:12.760
Certainly hope you won't have to give an apology publicly to Austin Security Solutions.

48:12.760 --> 48:18.000
I wonder if they have anything to say about you associating them with your bullshit that

48:18.000 --> 48:19.880
you took from QAnon while you were on the air.

48:19.880 --> 48:21.680
I wonder if they're thrilled about that.

48:21.680 --> 48:24.000
I think we should see what they think.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
I wonder.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Yeah.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.640
I would have maybe checked in on it, but I don't like to stir the pot.

48:29.640 --> 48:30.640
Ah, come on now.

48:30.640 --> 48:36.280
Anyway, Alex, as he's going over the story too, the story sucks.

48:36.280 --> 48:37.280
It doesn't work.

48:37.280 --> 48:38.280
Sure.

48:38.280 --> 48:42.040
But it sucks even more because he just makes up conclusions.

48:42.040 --> 48:47.360
So the real headline is Chinese Communist government caught laundering 400 million through

48:47.360 --> 48:51.600
Swiss Bank to Dominion month before election.

48:51.600 --> 48:52.600
Whoa.

48:52.600 --> 48:53.600
Whoa.

48:53.600 --> 48:57.160
Well, you got me there.

48:57.160 --> 49:01.720
That whoa, I can't hear it any other way than it being Alex, like kind of being impressed

49:01.720 --> 49:02.720
with himself.

49:02.720 --> 49:03.720
Yeah.

49:03.720 --> 49:04.720
I can't believe I did that.

49:04.720 --> 49:05.720
Whoa.

49:05.720 --> 49:06.720
Look at this shit.

49:06.720 --> 49:07.720
This sounds real.

49:07.720 --> 49:08.720
We got five PDFs.

49:08.720 --> 49:13.640
Admittedly, four of them say, don't believe anything in these, but we're still doing great.

49:13.640 --> 49:20.280
One time I was riding my bike and I went down a hill and I lost control of the bike and

49:20.280 --> 49:27.040
I was able to get a shoulder down on my way down and I ended up rolling and I got like,

49:27.040 --> 49:32.540
it was one of the coolest things that no one else saw is I landed more or less like I had

49:32.540 --> 49:33.540
meant to do it.

49:33.540 --> 49:34.540
Sure.

49:34.540 --> 49:35.540
Sure.

49:35.540 --> 49:36.540
Sure.

49:36.540 --> 49:37.540
Yeah.

49:37.540 --> 49:38.540
You did a little bit of an acrobatic move.

49:38.540 --> 49:39.540
It was all an accident.

49:39.540 --> 49:44.480
It was all just landing exactly coincidentally how I needed to, to roll over and then sort

49:44.480 --> 49:45.480
of be on my feet.

49:45.480 --> 49:46.480
Sure.

49:46.480 --> 49:50.160
All of a sudden you just woke up in the gymnast pose, like bowing to the judges that aren't

49:50.160 --> 49:51.160
there.

49:51.160 --> 49:52.160
And yeah.

49:52.160 --> 49:53.160
Whoa.

49:53.160 --> 49:54.160
Whoa.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.160
Whoa.

49:55.160 --> 49:56.160
Yeah.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.160
That's kind of that.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.160
It does.

49:58.160 --> 49:59.160
It does have a little bit of that same feel.

49:59.160 --> 50:01.160
I just fucking said that I proved that China paid dominion.

50:01.160 --> 50:02.160
Whoa.

50:02.160 --> 50:07.420
It is a little bit like the first time you throw a rolled up piece of paper into a garbage

50:07.420 --> 50:12.560
can in the office from a ways away and everybody sees it and you're like, whoa, this always

50:12.560 --> 50:14.040
happens when no one's looking.

50:14.040 --> 50:15.040
Holy shit.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.040
I got this one.

50:16.040 --> 50:23.480
I mean, but for Alex, like everyone who's in the studio is like, no one's impressed.

50:23.480 --> 50:27.360
Anyway, this is so sad to me.

50:27.360 --> 50:28.280
Like I understand.

50:28.280 --> 50:35.100
I, I, I can, I can see the audience, our audience, and everyone's laughing at Alex and I don't

50:35.100 --> 50:36.200
begrudge you for it.

50:36.200 --> 50:43.600
And I probably am only sad because I'm overly invested in, in this sort of like this story.

50:43.600 --> 50:44.600
Right.

50:44.600 --> 50:45.600
Right.

50:45.600 --> 50:51.600
And it's so sad to me to see this guy who knows that he's lying about impressed with

50:51.600 --> 50:57.600
himself, but, but, but, but lying about why you should be impressed with him like it's,

50:57.600 --> 50:58.600
this is so gross.

50:58.600 --> 51:04.800
Now I was put on the lead of this by a very high level individual in the white house and

51:04.800 --> 51:05.800
I said, why me?

51:05.800 --> 51:08.080
And they said, look, we already know it's there.

51:08.080 --> 51:09.520
This has to be independent.

51:09.520 --> 51:10.520
You need to go find it.

51:10.520 --> 51:17.420
So I hired a security firm and I told him dig, and then this came in and it's all confirmed.

51:17.420 --> 51:22.760
Like he has to create this, this whole spy novel where the white house is like, you're

51:22.760 --> 51:23.760
there.

51:23.760 --> 51:24.760
Oh, that you're independent.

51:24.760 --> 51:25.760
This has got to come from the outside.

51:25.760 --> 51:27.260
What the fuck?

51:27.260 --> 51:29.600
This sounds like Pachannik wrote it for him.

51:29.600 --> 51:35.840
I mean, even, even kind of a, so the white house came to me and told me to investigate

51:35.840 --> 51:38.400
things and this is what showed up.

51:38.400 --> 51:40.320
I can tell you that Steve didn't.

51:40.320 --> 51:41.320
Okay.

51:41.320 --> 51:45.960
Because Steve does show up later and Alex brings some of this up to him and Steve's

51:45.960 --> 51:48.040
really not into it.

51:48.040 --> 51:49.040
Not for it.

51:49.040 --> 51:50.040
Okay.

51:50.040 --> 51:51.040
Of course.

51:51.040 --> 51:52.040
But, but some...

51:52.040 --> 51:53.040
Steve's got a zag.

51:53.040 --> 51:54.040
Some Steve-ish person, perhaps.

51:54.040 --> 51:55.040
Yeah.

51:55.040 --> 51:56.040
This is very Stevie.

51:56.040 --> 51:57.040
Yeah.

51:57.040 --> 51:58.040
Yeah.

51:58.040 --> 52:04.920
I don't know what the deal is or like, you know, obviously this came from like QAnon

52:04.920 --> 52:08.560
posts and online conspiracy swamp nonsense.

52:08.560 --> 52:12.960
And Alex is the basis for Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan character.

52:12.960 --> 52:17.920
But man, the, the patheticness of coming up with how important you are and, and needing

52:17.920 --> 52:23.920
to project that to the audience is just like, God damn, I don't, I don't know how I, I don't

52:23.920 --> 52:25.200
know how you could live like that.

52:25.200 --> 52:26.720
It's just so false.

52:26.720 --> 52:27.720
Totally.

52:27.720 --> 52:33.600
Anyway, in this next clip, Alex is getting down to business on the Linwood situation.

52:33.600 --> 52:39.680
The president's lawyer who has said that Trump needs to call for martial law and hey, why

52:39.680 --> 52:41.120
not call for a new election?

52:41.120 --> 52:42.120
Yeah.

52:42.120 --> 52:43.120
Why not?

52:43.120 --> 52:44.640
Do you think Alex is for or against this idea?

52:44.640 --> 52:49.840
I'm going to go with for, but I would even almost argue against the new election part.

52:49.840 --> 52:51.440
Just stick with martial law for a bit.

52:51.440 --> 52:52.440
He's just for it all.

52:52.440 --> 52:53.440
Okay.

52:53.440 --> 52:56.000
And I'm going to go ahead and again, read you this headline right here.

52:56.000 --> 53:05.680
Tony Linwood, president Trump should declare martial law and hold new election.

53:05.680 --> 53:12.520
Then he goes through in this full page article, full page ad, can still pay to get your speech

53:12.520 --> 53:13.520
out, I guess in America.

53:13.520 --> 53:17.600
And I totally agree with his constitutional analysis.

53:17.600 --> 53:21.400
Hey, totally agrees with Linwood that we need to just fucking have a new election because

53:21.400 --> 53:22.400
he lost.

53:22.400 --> 53:26.240
Why are you guys wasting my time even saying a new election?

53:26.240 --> 53:27.240
Shut up.

53:27.240 --> 53:30.440
Like if he wins that one, you guys are going to be like, well, I guess we were wrong this

53:30.440 --> 53:31.440
time.

53:31.440 --> 53:32.440
Yeah.

53:32.440 --> 53:33.440
Like if Biden wins this time.

53:33.440 --> 53:34.440
Get the fuck out of here.

53:34.440 --> 53:35.440
Yeah.

53:35.440 --> 53:36.440
Come on.

53:36.440 --> 53:37.440
Like you are one, like you're going to let the election be whatever.

53:37.440 --> 53:38.440
Yeah.

53:38.440 --> 53:39.440
Yeah.

53:39.440 --> 53:40.440
Yeah.

53:40.440 --> 53:41.440
Yeah.

53:41.440 --> 53:42.440
Shut the fuck up.

53:42.440 --> 53:43.440
Just say you want Trump to be president for life and you'll destroy the Republic for it.

53:43.440 --> 53:44.440
Hey, Jordan, shut up.

53:44.440 --> 53:45.440
Yeah.

53:45.440 --> 53:49.240
The only way there could be a fair election is if it didn't happen.

53:49.240 --> 53:51.200
Is this a, is this a Zen Cohen?

53:51.200 --> 53:55.640
Trump voting machines, Trump branded voting machines.

53:55.640 --> 53:56.640
It's the only way to be sure.

53:56.640 --> 54:01.320
It's the only way you can trust that it's impartial if they are made by Trump's company.

54:01.320 --> 54:02.320
All right.

54:02.320 --> 54:03.320
Let me pitch you this.

54:03.320 --> 54:04.320
All right.

54:04.320 --> 54:06.560
Everybody but Trump's own companies are against him.

54:06.560 --> 54:07.560
Exactly.

54:07.560 --> 54:08.560
Obviously.

54:08.560 --> 54:09.560
All right.

54:09.560 --> 54:10.560
He makes his own voting machines.

54:10.560 --> 54:11.720
They look very similar to him.

54:11.720 --> 54:14.520
They've got a computer screen where his chest is.

54:14.520 --> 54:20.400
If you press for Biden, a little container opens up, a little gun comes out, boom.

54:20.400 --> 54:21.400
Gotta vote for Trump.

54:21.400 --> 54:22.400
Every time.

54:22.400 --> 54:23.400
The gun swabs you.

54:23.400 --> 54:24.400
The Trump Dalek.

54:24.400 --> 54:25.400
Yes.

54:25.400 --> 54:26.400
Yeah.

54:26.400 --> 54:27.400
Yeah.

54:27.400 --> 54:28.400
Anyway.

54:28.400 --> 54:32.120
Um, Alex, uh, one of the reasons that there needs to be a new election is, uh, this story.

54:32.120 --> 54:38.240
By the way, they now have a dominion engineer in the key County in Georgia, walking up illegally,

54:38.240 --> 54:41.600
plugging a thumb drive in, walking out with it for a few hours, coming back and plugging

54:41.600 --> 54:43.040
it back in totally illegal.

54:43.040 --> 54:44.040
That's how you change votes.

54:44.040 --> 54:45.340
I mean, we have them folks.

54:45.340 --> 54:46.340
We have them.

54:46.340 --> 54:47.340
We have them.

54:47.340 --> 54:49.600
Alex doesn't even know what County this video is from.

54:49.600 --> 54:50.600
It's a key County.

54:50.600 --> 54:51.600
Please.

54:51.600 --> 54:53.240
He doesn't even care about this shit at all.

54:53.240 --> 54:55.920
He's just literally repeating QAnon posts from social media.

54:55.920 --> 54:56.920
He saw it.

54:56.920 --> 54:58.060
This is just another one.

54:58.060 --> 55:02.080
This was a QAnon witch hunt that started from a video of a dominion tech net technician

55:02.080 --> 55:06.760
doing their job, which in the imagination of these idiots on social media became proof

55:06.760 --> 55:08.720
of a person changing votes.

55:08.720 --> 55:13.680
The proof that's given for this is that people watching the video assume that must be what

55:13.680 --> 55:14.680
the guy's doing.

55:14.680 --> 55:15.680
Therefore it's been proven.

55:15.680 --> 55:17.200
It's almost comically dumb.

55:17.200 --> 55:18.200
Yeah.

55:18.200 --> 55:19.200
That is very stupid.

55:19.200 --> 55:23.200
What's more profitable is the fact that the major players of the Q bullshit were amplifying

55:23.200 --> 55:27.760
and leading a dachshund campaign against this dominion employee who is now almost certainly

55:27.760 --> 55:29.440
afraid for his life.

55:29.440 --> 55:33.320
This employee was not manipulating votes, but now because of people like Alex Jones

55:33.320 --> 55:38.200
and Ron Watkins, a huge chunk of the public thinks that he's either definitely or probably

55:38.200 --> 55:40.660
guilty of changing votes.

55:40.660 --> 55:45.420
This is a real person who's been singled out and had a nefarious story written about him

55:45.420 --> 55:51.380
for no reason, except to satisfy the corruption lust of a disenchanted group of conspiracy

55:51.380 --> 55:52.380
lunatics.

55:52.380 --> 55:55.580
And now he's got people tweeting nooses at him.

55:55.580 --> 55:56.580
So fun.

55:56.580 --> 56:02.040
Yeah, QAnon, the conservative media has essentially turned all of the internet into the Eye of

56:02.040 --> 56:05.920
Sauron and if at any time points upon you, you'll be destroyed.

56:05.920 --> 56:10.520
Yeah, and good job just amplifying that, Alex, and good job learning the lessons of your

56:10.520 --> 56:11.520
career.

56:11.520 --> 56:15.480
And good job, good job figuring out the things that have gotten you in trouble in the past

56:15.480 --> 56:17.640
and then continuing to do those things.

56:17.640 --> 56:23.200
Yeah, I mean, you know, he has in a way learned the lessons, which is that there are no negative

56:23.200 --> 56:26.920
consequences except for people who aren't him and he doesn't care about them.

56:26.920 --> 56:31.000
Well, at least he doesn't bring up the guy's name, so there's that.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.640
Anyway, we need martial law.

56:32.640 --> 56:37.040
And the reason we do is because there's already martial law or maybe something, I don't know.

56:37.040 --> 56:38.040
Sure, whatever.

56:38.040 --> 56:40.040
This is the UN global takeover.

56:40.040 --> 56:44.720
So the response is martial law to stop their martial law and arrest them.

56:44.720 --> 56:45.720
That makes sense.

56:45.720 --> 56:47.040
Yeah, we need a coup to stop the counter coup.

56:47.040 --> 56:51.480
Yeah, we got to coup the couers before they coup us and they'll be couped.

56:51.480 --> 56:54.080
We need martial law in order to fight martial law.

56:54.080 --> 56:55.080
And you know what?

56:55.080 --> 56:56.320
Trump kind of has to do it.

56:56.320 --> 56:57.320
He does.

56:57.320 --> 57:01.760
Roger Stone calls on Trump to seize total power and assert martial law.

57:01.760 --> 57:04.440
What he said was he has total power in the constitution.

57:04.440 --> 57:09.680
If they have dominion software and fraudulent stuff, he has to move and seize those.

57:09.680 --> 57:15.440
If the FBI and the courts won't act, he has to declare the civil emergency.

57:15.440 --> 57:17.560
He's the executive protect the republic.

57:17.560 --> 57:19.840
This is when you do it.

57:19.840 --> 57:26.760
I'm an expert on martial law, ladies and gentlemen, wanted to have it through Obama or the Clintons

57:26.760 --> 57:28.180
to take our guns.

57:28.180 --> 57:31.480
This is them doing it to move the president out to do it.

57:31.480 --> 57:37.520
This is their UN globalist medical martial law, as the archbishop and others have called

57:37.520 --> 57:41.960
it's what it is to circumvent the government and hope the government just stands back and

57:41.960 --> 57:43.080
watches it all happen.

57:43.080 --> 57:46.640
I got to say after that clip, I really do think that he is an expert on martial law.

57:46.640 --> 57:48.520
Um, and, uh, yeah.

57:48.520 --> 57:49.520
Okay.

57:49.520 --> 57:50.520
Okay.

57:50.520 --> 57:54.000
So if I understand this correctly, the UN is declaring martial law.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
Yeah.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.440
So Trump has to declare martial law in order to stop the UN's martial law.

57:58.440 --> 57:59.440
Right.

57:59.440 --> 58:02.180
Now I'm going to toss this out there for you as a possibility.

58:02.180 --> 58:06.720
So Trump has declared martial law and martial law is declared.

58:06.720 --> 58:08.520
What if the UN just removes Trump?

58:08.520 --> 58:12.280
We're, we're still in martial law.

58:12.280 --> 58:13.280
What do you mean?

58:13.280 --> 58:17.360
I mean like once we're in martial law, it doesn't matter.

58:17.360 --> 58:19.840
Somebody's going to be the martial law person forever.

58:19.840 --> 58:23.760
Well, you know, in Alex's world, that's forever.

58:23.760 --> 58:28.280
That's something that has always been a part of his ideas.

58:28.280 --> 58:29.280
Right.

58:29.280 --> 58:32.080
Now, let me, let me float this.

58:32.080 --> 58:38.080
Look, their martial law is bad and it'll happen forever because you can't trust anybody.

58:38.080 --> 58:42.880
Once they get in power, they'll never get out of power, except for Donald Trump because

58:42.880 --> 58:43.880
he's really cool.

58:43.880 --> 58:44.880
Right.

58:44.880 --> 58:48.440
So you just got to let him have martial law temporarily, which I have told you on many

58:48.440 --> 58:51.920
occasions is impossible and doesn't exist, but it will.

58:51.920 --> 58:55.600
Trust me, he just wants to clean stuff up and then he'll get, he'll stop the martial

58:55.600 --> 58:56.600
law.

58:56.600 --> 58:57.600
Right.

58:57.600 --> 58:59.120
But it seems like you're just getting rid of one of the steps that they would have to

58:59.120 --> 59:00.120
take.

59:00.120 --> 59:04.160
Because then they could just kill him and you're already under martial law.

59:04.160 --> 59:08.680
And then they don't even have to bring in their people.

59:08.680 --> 59:10.520
I don't know how Alex would respond to that.

59:10.520 --> 59:11.520
Yeah, I don't know.

59:11.520 --> 59:12.920
I mean, it's just dumb.

59:12.920 --> 59:14.000
It's very stupid.

59:14.000 --> 59:19.440
For Mr. Martial Law, Mr. Anti-Martial Law, whose whole career has largely been about

59:19.440 --> 59:26.000
how tyrants never give up power once they achieve, you know, like some modicum of power.

59:26.000 --> 59:32.080
Like for him to be like, no, we need a dictatorship for a short time in order to solve the problems

59:32.080 --> 59:34.120
of my imaginary enemies.

59:34.120 --> 59:35.120
That's great.

59:35.120 --> 59:37.040
It's just kind of silly.

59:37.040 --> 59:39.500
It's not, it's not funny.

59:39.500 --> 59:40.500
It's sad.

59:40.500 --> 59:41.500
Yeah.

59:41.500 --> 59:42.500
It's very pathetic.

59:42.500 --> 59:46.300
Listening to somebody talk like that and not be challenged with just like the simplest

59:46.300 --> 59:48.720
of like, uh, that's dumb.

59:48.720 --> 59:49.720
Yeah.

59:49.720 --> 59:55.360
From anyone around them, from their longtime listeners, audience, from a voice within themselves.

59:55.360 --> 59:56.360
Yeah.

59:56.360 --> 59:57.360
Something.

59:57.360 --> 59:59.600
Anything pushing back and being like, do you even, do you hear yourself?

59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.600
Yeah.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.600
Yeah.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.600
Yeah.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.600
Get the fuck out of here.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.600
Yeah.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.600
It's like, it's a wonderful life, but instead of the angel showing up, he just jumps.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.600
Yeah.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.440
At the beginning, he's just like, eh, fuck it.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:12.720
Or like a Christmas Carol, but like all the ghosts are like, Scrooge, you're great.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.720
You're the best.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.640
You're just so great, man.

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.200
You are just doing so good.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.960
When you die, you're going to get to hang with us.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.600
We're going to have a great old time.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.160
Hey, hey, Christmas morning, here's what you got to do.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:24.160
Beat up Tiny Tim.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.160
Take his crutch.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.160
Take his fucking crutch, man.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.160
Yeah.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.160
Yeah.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.160
Get him.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.160
Get him.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.160
As in death, so is life.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.160
Whoo.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.160
The ghost of Christmas past just, get him.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.160
Get him.

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.160
Uh, yeah.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.160
That's good stuff.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:45.160
It's just getting dictatory as hell up in here.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.680
Therefore, we the people must demand.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:48.680
Real quick.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.640
He's reading Linwood's statement that he's made.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.640
It's a long statement.

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.640
Alex reads most of it.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:58.800
I don't care, but anyway, here, this is just a part of that and Alex's take on it.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:04.880
Therefore, we, the people must demand a new and fair national vote, a vote that all Americans

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.760
can trust and live by regardless of the winner.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:15.560
Without a fair vote, we fear, with good reason, the threat of a shooting civil war is imminent.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.320
Gun sales are at all time high and 40% for the first time gun owners looking to defend

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.480
themselves, their property and their rights.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:29.480
Therefore we must act now before there is no peaceful way left to preserve our nation.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:32.080
Exactly why the Chai comms and the UN do this?

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:37.640
Because even if Trump removes the fraud, there'll be a civil war if he goes through the fraudulent

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.640
system.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.340
It needs to be, it's Chai comm attack.

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:44.180
He has to arrest the heads of the media.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.200
He has to arrest them.

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:49.760
They're all Chinese agents, all the proof, and we have to just go after them and have

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.760
Nuremberg trials.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.800
I mean, this is an attempt to take over.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:53.800
Wow.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.800
Okay.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.400
So I guess we've got to arrest them, the heads of the media.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.400
Okay.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.400
Okay.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:03.640
So if I am sounding familiar, if I understand correctly, even if Trump uses the system to

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:07.120
root out the corruption, there's going to be a civil war.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.120
Well, yeah.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.120
Yeah.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:15.400
However, if Trump instantly and extemporaneously arrests all the heads of the media, right.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:19.560
Takes care of all of the generals that he doesn't like, removes everybody in government,

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.560
dissolves the Senate.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.560
Yeah.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.560
No civil war.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.560
Well, dissolves the house at least.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:24.560
Oh, well at least.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.560
Yeah.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.560
I mean the Senate for now is fine.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:27.560
Yeah.

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:28.560
We'll keep that one in the Supreme Court.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.560
Yeah.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:30.560
Yeah.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.560
It's strange.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.560
So that one wouldn't start a civil war is what you're saying to me.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.800
Here's, I mean, it's obviously a veiled threat.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:36.800
Yes.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:41.480
I'm pretty sure it's very much a, you give us Trump or we kill all of you as a threat.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.880
Why are we even acting like he's calling for a new election?

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.880
He said, give us Trump or we kill you.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.880
No, no, no.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:50.120
There is a circumstance where in the new election would be acceptable.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:55.560
Now a new election, just on these same voting machines owned by China.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.560
Right.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:57.560
No.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.560
Right.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.880
We can't have a new election because that'll just get stolen too.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.880
Okay.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:02.880
What about paper ballots?

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:03.880
Great.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.640
They have to be counted by Trump family members.

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:11.440
I'm starting to feel like you guys want this to be in your favor.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.840
Was gerrymandering not enough for you?

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:14.840
Apparently not.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.840
Yeah, well.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:21.480
It's really funny, Linwood and Sidney Powell have their press conference on the second

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.360
day of this, I believe on December 2nd.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:29.280
And maybe it was on the first, I can't remember what day it was, but they are like, yeah,

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.040
and we're not going to participate in this Georgia election.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.040
Don't vote.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.040
Don't vote.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.040
Don't do it.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.040
I guarantee it.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.440
I think it's a terrible idea.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.840
I love that.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.680
And Trump, I wish you had balls to veto that defense bill.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:46.160
Alex doesn't have any take on that stuff.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:51.280
Although I thought that would be the most interesting, like Sidney Powell and Linwood

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.560
telling people not to vote in the Georgia runoff.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.560
I'm all for it.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.560
I'm all for it.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:00.640
It's going to give a very significant advantage to the Democratic candidates.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.640
Yes.

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.640
Please.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.640
Why?

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.080
This is what I've been waiting for the whole time.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:09.800
We can't be cooed and taken over by the dumbest people on the planet.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:13.880
They need to dumb it up so much we don't even have to work for it, Dan.

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.920
I, I, yeah, I'm very interested in that.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:20.500
And then also I was, I would be very interested in Alex's take on Trump's, uh, you know, threatening

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.500
to veto the NDAA.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.500
The 230?

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.500
Yeah.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:24.500
Oh yeah.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:25.500
Well, because that has to do with the 230.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.500
Yeah, exactly.

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:31.120
Um, because Alex should hate the NDAA.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.120
Right.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.120
Because he does.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.120
Yes.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.480
So he should be in favor of Trump vetoing that.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.480
Right.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.960
But he also wants to get back on Twitter.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:44.600
Well, it's such a complicated position.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:48.520
He's finally forced into the most nuanced position of his career and he's reacting the

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:51.280
way we all knew he would pretending it's not happening.

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.000
Let me go ahead and gamble.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.060
Uh, he forgets he doesn't like the NDA.

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:56.060
It's weird.

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.760
It's weird how he won't remember that very shortly.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:58.760
Yeah.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:04.320
But he does remember that he paid people a lot of money to dig up this story about China

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.320
and dominion.

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.320
Okay.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:12.080
So he goes out, this is the total proof hiding in plain view and we have put it out for you

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:17.160
and hired the big investigative team to dig through all this and they tried to hide it,

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.800
but they failed.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:19.800
They tried to hide it.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:25.200
The subsidiary names and subgroups, but we tracked it all back and we have it now separately

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:30.360
going to break in just a few seconds, a promo code Patriot, you get an additional 10% off.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.360
All right, man.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.360
Yeah.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.880
I think he's got a good point.

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.840
I think you can only own one business, the end.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:44.820
No, none of this UBS, none of this, uh, this is steel and staples and UBS company limited

01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:45.820
and UBS.

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:48.000
So it's 25% no one business per.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.400
I don't think you have any idea how complicated it is.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.400
One business per.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.400
All right.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:06:00.360
I mean, I do sometimes forget that you have a degree in small business administration.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:05.040
One business per.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.640
Not just that, not just very dumb.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.640
Everyone gets one.

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:14.920
I understand that corporate structures are confusing and sometimes a bit complicated

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:21.720
to the untrained eye, simplify it by making it impossible to work.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.720
Great.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.720
Good.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.720
Exactly.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.720
That was my idea.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.720
Yeah.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:31.320
I mean, Alex continues to bring up this dominion employee who's been getting lots of threats

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:36.240
and I would say this is a bad idea, but at least, at least he's not saying his name or

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.240
anything.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:41.120
And I'm going to come back and recap the top news and then show you footage of dominion

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:44.100
worker reportedly caught manipulating voter data.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.780
What they did was illegal on tape.

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.440
We actually know who he is.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:51.040
We're not going to release his name yet, but we've got the Intel and so do our people.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.840
Uh, but this is incredible.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.040
This will not stand global as you've been caught.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:58.520
We do not accept your fraudulent leader, your chai comm agent, Joe Biden.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:06:59.520
You're on notice.

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.440
Remarkable restraint on Alex's part.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:06.600
Not saying this person's name because, you know, I mean that that's kind of a big part

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:10.880
of what's gotten him in trouble in the past, which is, you know, leading and amplifying

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:17.160
kind of campaigns that seek to harass, threaten, intimidate private citizens.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:21.560
Uh, so I hope, you know, I hope, I hope he doesn't get into that.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:22.560
Yeah.

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:29.000
I think it's, I think it's so weird how willing he is to go after individual people.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
How weird.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.360
Like I think that's the only way he can really assert power.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.360
I suppose.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:36.000
Cause I don't think anybody else is scared of him.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Like right.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Doesn't give a fuck.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
That's fair.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.680
James, the guy who owned comet ping pong was ready to take him to court.

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:48.080
Like he, Alex backed down hard when those people were like, no, fuck you.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:49.080
Yeah.

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.520
Uh, people like a day of David Rothschild.

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:55.400
He showed up on Alex's show and talked to him for like half an hour.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.760
Bill Ayers showed up and was like, what are you talking about?

01:07:58.760 --> 01:07:59.760
Yeah.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.120
Like these people aren't afraid of him.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.120
You know who is?

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.120
Someone who could be hurt.

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.120
Random strangers.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.120
Yeah.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:12.120
But I, like I said, man, there's pathos, there's pathos because you can really tell that Alex

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:17.120
loves telling this story about how Trump's people told him to get to the bottom of this

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.760
dominion thing.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:23.720
It's so sad when you know, what's up, and this is just a conspiracy from Cuban onboards.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.400
God, this is so sad.

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:31.480
We are living in the most incredible time in world history on so many fronts, but I

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:40.360
got a call from the president's representative and they asked me three weeks ago when I was

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.360
in Arizona.

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:48.720
Uh, let's just say one of Trump's sons gave me a call and he put me in touch with a, a

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:51.280
executive, uh, with a major voting machine company.

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:53.280
I'm gonna leave it at that.

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:56.900
And they said, look, we know Soros, the Chinese are involved.

01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:00.080
We want you to investigate it and we want you to separately bring it out.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.440
And I said, well, if you know it, why, why do I have to find it?

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:06.920
And they said, look, I said, oh, cause it's, it's classified and I've got to find it myself.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.400
They said, we're not saying that.

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:14.120
Well, I got a call two days ago from the security firm I hired, uh, that were former army internal

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.100
security, uh, researchers.

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.640
So they're good, good researchers.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:25.480
And they ferreted out and found that 75 plus percent of a major Swiss UBS bank investment

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:32.280
firm is owned by the communist party, a central committee and by one of their major provinces

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:42.840
and that they put all of this money, 400 million into dominion.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:47.360
I just can't get over how pathetic this is.

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.360
Yeah.

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:52.760
This is like a school kid bragging about like their dad being Superman.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.760
Yeah.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:59.000
You know, like the president will all just say, I'll leave it at one of his sons called

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.760
me and said, you got to get, Ooh, is it cause it's classified?

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:03.760
We're not saying that.

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:04.760
Cause it's not.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:05.760
Yeah.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:06.760
SEC filings.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:10.000
It's a, it's a little bit like a, um, like a con man.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.200
Uh, it's very much like, no, no.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.200
Yeah.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.720
I mean he is a con man, but I'm, I'm, this particular one reminds me of like the old

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:21.580
ones where it's somebody with a vaguely European accent who's talking to the New York stock

01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:27.320
exchange people like, yes, I'm a representative of King Harold and uh, he's trying to keep

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.320
it all secret.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.360
Very, very secret of course.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.780
But if you loan me $1 million, I'll be able to, yeah.

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:37.220
And if you know that the King is, you're like, you're a fucking lunatic, man.

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:40.760
If you're not pulling it off, you look like an insane person.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:41.760
Yeah.

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:42.760
Yeah.

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:46.960
And uh, you know, simultaneously I can see this and he is not pulling it off.

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:47.960
Right.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:53.840
But there's probably enough people who are just dumb or just captured by him and think

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:59.040
that he means a goddamn word he says, and that's really sad.

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:02.400
It's really sad for them and it's really sad for Alex.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.400
Yeah.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:04.400
It really is.

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.400
Yeah.

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:10.600
Just on a human level that he's a 40 something year old man, 46, 47 year old man who's in

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:17.300
his studio bragging complete bullshit lies about the president's son telling him to do

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:20.840
this investigation that he just saw in a QAnon board.

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:23.800
Well when you put it in that context, it sounds bad.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:24.800
It is.

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:29.340
Anyway, it's also like, this is just, it's painful to me.

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:35.280
Like I had a really tough time with the first half of this December 1st episode because

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.280
it is this.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:40.580
It's, it's, it's, this dude is just a sad mope.

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:46.140
This is 1 trillion percent the smoking gun and then it just gets worse from there.

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:52.240
The communist Chinese wired through a secretive Swiss bank account, $400 million to Dominion

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.960
on October 7th.

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.960
I mean, wow.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.920
I suggest you go get these documents.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.840
I suggest you get them out and I don't normally say sources and things like that, but you

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.600
know, I want you to know how real this is.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:08.600
Okay.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.320
It's just, just a bummer.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.320
Yeah.

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.320
Oh boy.

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.320
And the other thing that's really sad about this is like, if you really look at it from

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:24.600
a professional perspective, Alex is reduced to taking something from QAnon circles, pretending

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:28.800
it's not that, and then just trying to resell it.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.380
Anybody who's like engaged in those QAnon communities would see this and be like, oh,

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.380
we already knew that.

01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:36.720
We knew this days before your article came out.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.080
This is old news to real conspiracy heads.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:44.720
Like it's, it's, he's trailing behind the thing that he thinks is a rip off of himself.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:45.720
Right.

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.520
And it's just, man, you should quit.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.520
You should just quit.

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.520
Yeah.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.520
If Shakespeare were alive today.

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:52.520
It's not good.

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:56.280
Me thinking she does protest too much would be like, Jesus fucking Christ, stop protesting.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.880
It's too obvious.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.880
Yeah.

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:02.960
Now I would say that Alex has been a little bit out of line with talking about this Dominion

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:08.360
employee, but I will say up till this point, he hasn't really been trying to like intimidate

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:11.040
the guy until now.

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.040
But here's video.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.040
We know who the guy is.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.240
We tracked him, Democrat operative.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.240
We know where he worked.

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:22.960
McDonald's and GameStop before this, we've not released his photo or his name yet, Javier.

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:27.160
But we have the footage of him in the Key County illegally, whether he knew it or not,

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.600
going up with a thumb drive, taking it out.

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:34.320
That's pretty much, that's really fucked up.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:38.320
That's really fucked up because you could also tell how much Alex kind of relished that

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.200
kind of that moment where he feels like he's threatening somebody.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.000
Javier, I know you.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.500
Anytime I can drop it on you.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.720
But at least there's a lot of Javier's in the world.

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:49.560
So like at least he didn't say his name.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:53.600
Palming the USB and waddling out.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:58.680
And we've got his name, Javier Corey, as we told you.

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:03.360
I wasn't going to break it myself, let Gateway Punden do it.

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.560
Stay in attack formation.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.560
Oops.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:09.640
Well, I hope this does not come back to bite you in the ass and you don't get sued.

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.920
I hope it does and he should be sued immediately.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:16.040
And even if nothing happens, the judge should look at his other lawsuits and be like, see,

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.040
this is what you're trying to do.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.040
I know it.

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.040
I can see it in your eyes.

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.040
You're trying to do this.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.320
This is a clear pattern of behavior.

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:25.680
This is the same shit and we're going to stop you before you kill this guy.

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.680
Hooray.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:33.520
Or this kind of behavior happening a couple days ago could be inserted as part of the

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.280
Sandy Hook trial.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.680
As a piece of information.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:44.120
Like he is not stopping from behaving in ways that are tailored to raising the possibility

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.360
of harm coming to private citizens.

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:50.960
I guess I do kind of understand.

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:51.960
He's an asshole.

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:52.960
He's an asshole.

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:59.800
I mean, it shouldn't work like, oh, okay, so you've just told me what the exact line

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:04.500
is, so what I'm going to do is tiptoe up to as close to the line as possible and then

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:08.200
wave my hands at you and be like, nah, nah, you can't catch me.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.880
I didn't kill this guy this time.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:13.720
Your honor, this is completely different because it's about a different thing.

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:14.720
Yeah.

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:16.360
Same behavior about a different thing.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.360
Oh, whatever.

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.620
What a fucking asshole.

01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:23.380
So now Jordan, I guess there's a lot of pathos at the beginning part and I was kind of bummed

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:27.520
out about it and there was a part of me that felt like, well, this is interesting because

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:32.720
it is pathetic and there's an interesting glimpse of Alex trying to put on his sort

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:39.080
of Superman jumper and try and play the role of what he thinks he is.

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:42.200
Daddy turned me into a detective, so I found everything.

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.560
And I was like, oh, that's interesting, but that's not great.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.680
I need more from this episode.

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:53.120
And thankfully another someone who might be a daddy to Alex shows up and that is our boy,

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.120
Steve Pechenik.

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.120
Dr. Steve.

01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:00.240
Let me remind you that a couple of weeks ago and several months ago, I told you that I

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:09.680
was told by my fellow countrymen in cyber command that I was to announce on your show

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:15.760
or when show your show that we had put a QFS watermarks on all the ballots.

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:21.680
We had monitored all the machines on Dominion and we had expected everything to come out

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:23.640
and it came out of cyber control.

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.120
Where's David Knight at?

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:29.160
I don't have the same factor that you have, but I do respect.

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.160
David, you in the building?

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.160
He's not happy about it.

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.880
I have to imagine.

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.320
Yeah, Steve's still on this still on it, huh?

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:43.600
And Alex is still having him on, which is weird because again, this is a direct contradiction

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.360
of literally every other talking point that Alex is spouting.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:53.280
Now, Steve is not only contradicting Alex in terms of like, no, this was a sting operation

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.160
this entire election.

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:59.160
He also is not thrilled with the idea that Alex is like, Hey, maybe we should have martial

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.160
law.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:03.400
Steve's like, no, we don't need martial law.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:09.320
What we have in effect now is we have prepared the sting operation, which I announced here

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.360
on Alex Jones because I was given that permission.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.040
He's given the permission.

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.040
It's cool.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:20.120
So yeah, man, I mean, look, OK, I'm never going to be like, hey, I have common cause

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.120
with Steve Pachannik.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.120
Right.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:27.320
But I do find it comforting on some level that he's not saying we need martial law.

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:32.560
Yeah, but he's also said we should dissolve the government and Melania should be queen.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:36.160
Yeah, that's why I don't want common cause.

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.960
I would like some clarity coming from Dr. Steve.

01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:39.960
All right.

01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:43.560
He's who I go to when I'm looking for sanity in this info world's world.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.120
When you need a North Star.

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.120
Exactly.

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.120
That's what I'm all about.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:52.800
Well, unfortunately, Alex decides that this is the time when he's going to be like, yeah,

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:53.800
I don't know.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:54.800
Ooh.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.680
Some people say you're making this up, you're full of it.

01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:57.680
Let me just David Knight.

01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:58.680
OK.

01:17:58.680 --> 01:17:59.680
And I think you're a credible person.

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.680
I respect you.

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:01.680
You've been really accurate in the past.

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.320
So that goes a long way for me.

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:06.680
That clip is essentially Alex trying to play both sides of the fence.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.680
Yeah.

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:10.880
Now, David says you're full of shit and I still want to talk to you.

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:16.160
So well, I think it's even less that and more just like if anybody in the audience were

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.320
to attack him from either side, he can cover his base with a clip like that.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.320
That's fair.

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:23.400
He can say that some people say that you're full of it.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.400
Yeah.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:27.040
You're a hard hitting journalist and pushing back on you.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:31.400
Then if someone is into Steve's theories, he'll be like, I said that he has a great

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:34.120
track record and that goes a long way with me.

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.120
Yeah.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.920
He's just being mealy mouthed here.

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:40.920
Anyway, Steve's talking about the situation we find ourselves in.

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:46.520
The ballots are all accounted for and barcodes or whatever the fuck.

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:52.740
And also, some generals have sent troops all over the country and the Supreme Court needs

01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:53.740
to be taken out.

01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:54.740
OK.

01:18:54.740 --> 01:19:01.880
I can tell you that Nakasone has been running a very effective monitoring system and that

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:06.400
we have deployed military elements all over the country.

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.440
I can tell you that in North Florida, the amount of planes that have come in with war

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:18.340
equipment, with a regular army, National Guard and others has increased markedly.

01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:25.200
I can tell you that at the same time, John Roberts, the Supreme Court, may have a problem.

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.880
He is a sick man.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.640
He's had a history of seizures.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:34.800
We know that his interpretation of corruption is what we call the minimalist quid pro quo

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:35.800
corruption.

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:36.800
Yikes.

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:37.800
Sure.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.600
That is what we call the minimalist quid pro quo corruption.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:41.600
Yeah.

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.600
Yeah.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.600
Cool.

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:44.600
Cool.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:48.000
You're talking about sort of, you know, the inefficiency, like A, he's unqualified, the

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.680
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:53.680
Meanwhile, we've got General Nakasone coming in and bringing an army into Florida.

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.680
Sure.

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:55.680
Wow.

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:56.680
Tomorrow we march on Florida.

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.480
What are you doing?

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:03.080
I never know which of their plans I would be interested in letting play out.

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.080
Not that one.

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.080
Not that one.

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:06.080
No.

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:11.000
But sometimes they'll have like a, like they, all of their plans are like they have a pwinko

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.040
board and then they just drop something down.

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.040
Caravan.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.040
Caravan is a plan.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.040
I'm glad they followed through.

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.040
That's true.

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:21.780
In this episode, I have another one that I fucking hope Alex follows through with.

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:25.240
It will be my next, like Caravanity project.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:33.080
It will, if Alex does this, I might live stream for days straight of just like, we need updates

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.920
on what's going on with this.

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.240
It's one of the most exciting things.

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.440
You know what?

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:39.440
Fuck it.

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:40.440
Okay.

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:41.480
Unprecedented.

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:46.960
If Alex follows through with what he claims he's going to do later in this episode, I

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.320
might join him.

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.320
Okay.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.320
Okay.

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:51.320
All right.

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.320
For different reasons.

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.320
All right.

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.320
That's a tease because I don't know what he's going to talk about.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.320
No, I won't because of fucking COVID.

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.320
Don't worry about it.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.320
We'll figure it out.

01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:58.320
All right.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.320
Well, we'll talk about this later in the episode.

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:00.320
We'll get you in a bubble.

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.320
A literal bubble boy situation.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:04.900
So earlier you said, by the way, I hate to be a tease.

01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:08.240
This will all be revealed within this episode.

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:12.260
Earlier you were mentioning that like the way that Alex was talking about him being

01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:16.100
told to do this dominion investigation sounds steveish.

01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:21.840
And because steve is still on the, the election was a sting operation.

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:27.080
Why would then the government ask Alex to the left hand?

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.480
Can't know what the right hand's doing.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.480
Dan.

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:33.400
This is a problem for Alex though, especially in terms of presentation.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:36.160
He needs to ask Steve, help me out of this one guy.

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.160
Come on, buddy.

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:43.080
If Congress doesn't stand up, if the electors on December 15th, Dr. Steve, don't say no

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:46.840
to this fraud, then they will put Biden in and Trump says he'll go.

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:50.920
So if there is these watermarks and all this proof, and I believe you talked to those sources

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:51.920
who told you.

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:52.920
So I believe you're in good faith.

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:53.920
I think you're a good person.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:56.400
When do we see the cards on the table?

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.400
What's about to happen?

01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:01.400
Like why would the white house see to me, this doesn't mean I'm important.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:04.240
It means the president's a quadriplegic politically cut off.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:11.000
Why would they get me to go after a Soros and the chai comms and then we get the smoking

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.440
gun documents, but it takes us two and a half weeks to get it.

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:14.440
Why?

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:15.760
I mean, if they have this, why?

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:16.760
Why?

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.120
Because it doesn't make sense.

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:19.120
It's a great question.

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:20.480
Why would they do that?

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:24.120
Some would say it's an unanswerable question.

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:27.360
I would say that it's a very simple, they wouldn't.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.360
Yep.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.560
No, but Steve can't say that.

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.680
Oh no, that's a bad idea.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:35.560
No, because in order for their illusions to continue, that the audience needs to buy into

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.320
to keep the cash flow going.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.320
Of course.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:43.560
Steve needs to not be a complete liar and Alex needs to not be shown to have not talked

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:47.400
to the white house about this QAnon post that he's passing off as a scoop.

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.720
Everybody's in a little bit of a dangerous position right now.

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:50.720
Right.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:54.600
But there is a really smooth way to get out of this pickle and that is...

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.600
Leo Zagami.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:59.720
No, Steve's just got to do exactly what he always does when things get tough.

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:05.160
I appreciate the fact that you're getting very excited, but the reality is the game

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:07.040
has already been played.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:14.280
What's happening is that Trump anticipated most of this, Trump actually and the intelligence

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:20.880
community really picked you as the source for which I was to announce what they wanted

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:21.880
me to announce.

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.880
Because you're the best.

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:26.200
And I'm not just a certain person or stooge because I don't get paid.

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:28.480
I'm really not interested in promotion.

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:35.120
I really don't garner anything other than being a citizen warrior.

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:36.120
Crazy old man.

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:41.280
Chosen as the mainstream media, as opposed to the New York Times, The Post.

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:46.720
So although you're getting excited, what is happening all around you, Alex, is exactly

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.000
what we expected.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:53.080
Yeah, so, you know, when you're encountered with this unanswerable question where the

01:23:53.080 --> 01:24:01.000
only logical, rational, real world explanation is you're both crazy liars, you know, you

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.800
get out of that by being like, Alex, calm down.

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:05.800
You were chosen because you're so great.

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:06.800
You're the best.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.160
You're the best there ever was, buddy.

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:11.580
Look at these compliments and don't look at me.

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:14.440
That's a very easy way to get out of the conversation.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:21.680
And also, you know, then Steve can transition into other topics like Biden will never be

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:22.680
president.

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:23.680
Sure.

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:28.840
I will guarantee you Biden will not become president of the United States because right

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:35.960
now he's wearing possibly an ankle bracelet because he said he has a little bit of problem

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:40.120
on his ankle and he's you know, he's twisted his ankle.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:41.560
I don't believe that.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:43.620
So you might look at that problem.

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:48.480
So in effect, what you're seeing now, that sounds like cute stuff.

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.480
He's got an ankle bracelet.

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.480
I mean, I hope so.

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:54.240
I hope he gets a different type of bracelet.

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:59.120
Look, I can't get excited the way you can, Alex.

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.120
That's the reason why.

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.120
Come on.

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.080
I mean, this is not unusual for me.

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.640
We said it a long time ago.

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.160
Well, I want to believe you.

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:12.120
So in 50 days, I will tell you this, buddy, I am going to I'm just going to if you're

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.960
right in 50 days, you are going to be the king of the planet to me.

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.880
I already really like you.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.280
You got me great info over the years.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.040
You've been on the show for 19 years.

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.720
It's been really accurate info.

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:23.920
So I just I just hope you're right.

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:27.200
That is what it sounds like when someone doesn't believe someone.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.320
Fuck you, Alex.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.320
Fuck you.

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:31.320
That's not fair.

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:33.320
Get this dude off your show.

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:40.360
Not just that, but how dare you say that sounds like cute shit 20 minutes after you said cute

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.360
shit.

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:42.360
A bunch of it.

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.360
You fucking.

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:50.040
You're you're you're being very fast and loose with a private citizen's safety and you're

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:56.760
pitching a nonsensical, stupid voter fraud conspiracy based on QAnon.

01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:57.760
Yeah.

01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.760
Stuff.

01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:00.760
So you're saying his QAnon bullshit is stupid.

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:01.760
Wow.

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:02.760
That's unfair.

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.760
That's just rude.

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:04.760
Well, you got to make it look good.

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:05.760
That's rude.

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.760
Yeah.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:10.640
Anyway, Steve is a pro.

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:11.640
That's true.

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:15.280
When Alex says this sounds like QAnon stuff, he's like, hey, man, I can't get excited like

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.280
you get excited.

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.280
I don't know what that means.

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:20.400
But Steve's got to make it like, no, dude, you're so important.

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:21.860
You're so important.

01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:26.400
Every time Alex is getting a little bit out of pocket, I think you might be full of shit.

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:27.400
You're a good looking dude.

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:28.400
I think you're great.

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:29.400
Yeah.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.400
You know, I was wrong.

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:35.920
I should never have doubted you because of your show and that video that I did with you.

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.000
It was sent to China.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:44.640
And believe it or not, I got a call from what I call my Chinese nanny, who's been my control

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:48.480
officer in China for the past 30 years.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:54.520
That meant President Xi and the Public Bureau of Safety in China personally had to call

01:26:54.520 --> 01:27:01.840
me up three weeks ago because of the show that I went on on your show, Alex, to explain

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:07.560
that they are not looking for any trouble to say that it was an excellent show, meaning

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:12.640
that they don't want to get into a problem situation.

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:20.600
Steve went on our info wars and President Xi called and was like, hey man, we don't

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:21.600
want trouble.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.600
We don't want no trouble.

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.600
Steve.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.120
I do not know what I'm listening to.

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:29.200
I do not know what's actually happening right now.

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.200
That's absurd.

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:34.960
Alex being like, oh, Trump personally sent me on a message to investigate shit that I

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:39.760
made up and I'm creating this whole fictional mythology around how I'm great.

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:43.720
And then Steve coming with that bullshit at me.

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:44.720
Are we talking?

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:45.720
What am I watching?

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:48.640
Well, look, I think Steve knows that we exist.

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:53.520
I think he knows that in order to be interesting, he wants to make it on our show.

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.520
Exactly.

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.520
He's got to come with it.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:02.100
If you want to make the after show, your character needs to be interesting, especially if you're

01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:03.320
only on for short bursts.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:07.800
You don't want to be the character who doesn't get a rose, so to speak.

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:10.840
And Steve, I mean, he has, he gets a rose.

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:16.400
He is also somebody who unfortunately runs the risk of being pretty boring pretty easily

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.200
because he's made so many.

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:19.200
That's true.

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.200
Deep cuts.

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:23.520
His escalation has to be, yeah, it has to be president.

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:31.520
She called because he wanted to make sure no problems here guys just want to give you

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.520
a call.

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:34.400
So you got the go ahead and everything's okay.

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:39.020
She wants to parlay Hey guys, we just want you to say stay frosty

01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:40.020
out there.

01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:41.020
You keep going.

01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:46.280
She wants me to work as an intermediary between Alex Jones and China.

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:51.000
And again, just inexplicable and pointless little bit of racism there.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Sure.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.200
So Alex is having this interview with Steve and he's, he's also like, I gotta go.

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.200
I gotta leave early.

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:02.920
All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to be playing hooky in the next two hours

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:09.400
when Paul Joseph Watson has Candace Owens, an amazing guest on busy with breaking news

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:16.800
and documents and Intel that I have to go off air and tomorrow we'll have giant breaking

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:20.240
news here for you on air with the information I'm going to be getting.

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:21.240
But it's so huge.

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:23.700
I'm going to have to go off air in about 10 minutes.

01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:26.520
It's not, um, there's nothing big going on at all.

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:32.480
I would probably make myself scarce if, um, the, the team up is going to be Paul Joseph

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:34.600
Watson and Candace Owens.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:40.440
It's been my feeling that she's not thrilled with being associated with info wars actively.

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.440
Right.

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:45.840
Because I think that she thought that there was a bigger space for her, like with turning

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:46.840
point.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:47.840
Sure.

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:48.840
Sure.

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:49.840
Sure.

01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:50.840
Is never coming on info wars.

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:51.840
Right.

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:52.840
Right.

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:53.840
Right.

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:54.840
Right.

01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:55.840
I don't know.

01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:56.840
I haven't tracked her career as closely, but it seems like she's back in the place where

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:57.840
she would be on info wars.

01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:58.840
Yeah.

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:02.280
She thought she could get out into a bigger pond and now she's back in the small pond.

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.840
We'll be with Paul as opposed to be with Alex.

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:07.000
If you're going to do it, go with Paul.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
It's somehow seems safer for your reputation.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.280
Um, so Alex is going to leave early cause he's got to pretend to work.

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.280
Yeah.

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.280
Whatever.

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:17.280
Yeah.

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:18.280
Steve has one going anywhere.

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:20.240
He has one more big swing to make.

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.240
Okay.

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:22.240
I love this one.

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:23.980
I was like, what the fuck?

01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:28.800
So I'm telling you, Beijing called me directly because of the show that you're doing right

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:29.800
now.

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:35.880
And we wanted to use you as the main thoroughfare for that announcement.

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:41.280
The last part that you have to know is that ironically, one of my neighbors in Northern

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:47.600
Florida increased the fencing and the size of Gitmo by 200%.

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:56.440
In other words, I have a neighbor who's in charge of wire and fencing for prisons.

01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:05.320
And he went to Gitmo a year ago and increased the size of Gitmo Guantanamo based by over

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:07.120
a hundred percent.

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:08.960
Shouldn't you be against that?

01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:13.820
Is that, is he trying to say that's because Obama's taller than the other prisoners have

01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:15.040
been in the past?

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:16.600
Is that what we're trying to say?

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:17.600
Yeah.

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:22.560
The globalists that you're going to incarcerate in Guantanamo and your fantasies, the issue

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:26.040
with them and the safety there is wall size.

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:27.040
Height.

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.040
Yeah, wall size.

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:29.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.040
Yeah, this is silly.

01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:35.560
But what he's talking about is there were reports of Trump building new construction

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:42.000
at Guantanamo, whereas prior to this, the tendency and the trend had been towards closing

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
it.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000
So I think he's just trying to use some of those ideas, which are super popular in the

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
QAnon world.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Right, right, right.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.840
I think Steve is really just like, at this point.

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:50.840
He's just a Q guy.

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:51.840
Yeah.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.840
Yeah.

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:53.840
And so is Alex.

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:54.840
Yep.

01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:55.840
Quite frankly.

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:57.160
Q and the mighty have fallen.

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:58.160
Yeah.

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:01.680
Ah, so like such champions of weirdness becoming followers.

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:02.680
Yeah.

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:03.680
It's sad.

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:12.520
I mean, it is something to be said about Q's ability as a mental disease to infect, I mean,

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:13.920
everybody, you know?

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:14.920
Yeah.

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:17.000
It just gets fucking in your head with these people.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.960
You're not immune if you're a conspiracy leader.

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:20.960
Yeah.

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:21.960
You can fall.

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:22.960
Yeah.

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:23.960
Well, I mean.

01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:29.000
These people who are leaders are smart enough to not say this is what they're into.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Well, yeah, exactly.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.200
They know that they can take the ideas and the sort of trends in the conspiracy world

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:42.840
and then reorient them a little bit into being about like, my friend general has told me

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:43.840
the same thing.

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:44.840
Oh, yeah, sure.

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:47.480
Yeah, Q is saying that stuff, but that's just because it's parallel.

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:48.480
It's the same thing.

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:51.880
I'm just getting it from a real source, whereas, wait.

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:56.560
I imagine that it feels a little bit like stock speculating to be one of these conspiracy

01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:02.120
people dealing with Q, trying to be like, okay, well, I think this is one of the theories

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.120
that's going to stick.

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:09.480
And if I get on this one, then I'll get more whenever it goes mainstream, whereas.

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:13.920
It may be stock speculating, but it's also, there's no consequences for being wronged.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:16.280
Well, yeah, but that's fair.

01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:17.280
People just forget.

01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.960
Nobody just loses all their, yeah.

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:23.000
It would be like the stock market if whenever the stock went down, people forgot you bought

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
it.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.520
Every day, every day, a clean slate.

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.840
So Alex says goodbye to Steve.

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:35.160
And this is not how you part ways with someone who you think is credible.

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:36.160
God bless you.

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.160
We'll talk to you soon.

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:38.160
StevePaschinek.com.

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:39.160
Have a great, have a great week coming up.

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:40.160
You too.

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:41.160
All right.

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:43.160
Man, I hope he's right.

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:46.960
You shouldn't have to hope he's right.

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.280
I have the best guests.

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:53.480
I have the best people and man, I hope that bullshit he just spun makes sense.

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:54.480
Yeah.

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:55.480
It sounds good.

01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:56.480
Probably bullshit.

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:57.480
Nope.

01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:58.480
Bullshit.

01:33:58.480 --> 01:33:59.480
Yeah.

01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:04.840
So we jump into the second and Alex starting the show, really just sort of ruminating about

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:09.160
himself as a child and talking about things that are absolutely not true.

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:15.280
When I was six years old, seven years old, I liked to watch PBS Frontline.

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:25.160
I like to watch the long Supreme Court debates, the few that they ever televised.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:31.440
I really found how things actually work is incredibly interesting.

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:36.320
But then I learned that almost no one else actually wants to study how things work.

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:42.600
When Alex was six years old, he was so advanced, Jordan, you understand that he was watching

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:49.200
full, unedited C-SPAN Supreme Court hearings because he was so fascinated.

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:52.520
But as he got older, he realized no one was as serious as him.

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.780
Let me posit you an alternate theory.

01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:59.160
When he found out how hard it was to actually do research, he decided that what he did was

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.520
actual research and what everybody else did was crazy.

01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.520
Yeah.

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:08.200
At a certain point, he realized it's really tough to read a book, but to a third person

01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:13.160
or to somebody else, to an external observer, there is no difference between you having

01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.880
read the book and you saying you read the book.

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:17.320
That sounds true.

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:18.320
Yes.

01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:22.660
That is quite a revelation to have at the age of six and I applaud Alex for it.

01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:27.240
When I was six years old, I realized that if I put infinite jest on my bookshelf, people

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:28.240
will think I was smart.

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:32.280
I did that myself.

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:36.080
With the same book.

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:43.560
So Alex, god damn it, I was so excited at this point on the second.

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:50.040
I could have, I almost couldn't contain myself because I don't know if you remember this,

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:52.080
but I think it was a 2015 episode.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:58.560
Alex got on air and he was like, I am going to, in this episode, jump the shark.

01:35:58.560 --> 01:35:59.760
Yes, I do recall that.

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:05.640
I am going to, as a piece of art, performance art, call for the banning of Islam.

01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:06.640
Yep.

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:11.360
And then he proceeded to talk himself into not doing it as a performance art.

01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.360
It's a good idea to ban Islam.

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:19.120
But what he set out to do was like this thing that he was being overly clear about his intentions,

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:24.040
which kind of ruined the sort of satirical thrust of it.

01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:29.280
But it was like, I love to see that you had an idea and you wanted to try.

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:30.280
Right.

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:31.920
I got that again.

01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:38.200
Certainly, he made our satirical piece work by trying to do a satirical piece and then

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:42.400
winding up embodying the thing that he thought he was satirizing.

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:45.880
Yeah, it was interesting on that level.

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:48.400
And I guess it's the same this time.

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:57.080
Now, I thought about the best way to say this, but I'm just going to get it right out there.

01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:02.200
I think it will be more effective to wake you up if I actually join the dark side.

01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:04.160
Do it.

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:09.960
I am seriously considering completely shifting into the enemy mindset and presenting all

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:15.200
this and just telling people world government's good and that you should kill yourselves for

01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.200
the earth.

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:23.520
I mean, like, I would love it if he did as a joke, just did like a Bill Gates is great

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:29.840
because it would be the most incompetent, nonsensical piece of satire or sort of character

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:31.280
based nonsense.

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:32.280
I would love it.

01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:34.640
It would be, it would be a thrill.

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.560
One, it has to be a surprise.

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.240
Nobody can know you're about to do it.

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.240
Right.

01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:40.240
Two, you have to commit to the bit.

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:42.400
You have to open by saying something like that.

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:43.800
You have to stay solid.

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:47.320
You can't break character and you have to go for a good long while.

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:48.320
Right.

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:49.980
So, but I was like, ah, maybe.

01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:51.120
And he can't do any of those things.

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:53.520
But he's saying like, ah, I've just been thinking about this.

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:57.880
I got to go to the dark side and be like the globalists.

01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:03.360
And then he started to get real fucking dark, like to a point where like you are being what

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:06.960
I would consider quite to the dark side.

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:12.600
The public cares, good people care, Christians care.

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:19.320
That's the main group that's resisting, but everyone else is running headlong into it

01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:25.200
and wanting to be slaves, wanting to be slowly killed, wanting to be made unhappy, wanting

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:32.800
to be failures because they are not meant to go into the future.

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:33.800
They are meant to die.

01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:34.800
Wait, what?

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.120
And that's God's plan.

01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:37.120
Okay.

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:38.120
Wait.

01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:39.120
So, okay.

01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:45.280
So are you telling me that the evil enemy that you hate has come to the conclusion that

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:50.480
humans aren't worth living and has decided to kill all of us and you think that that's

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:51.480
evil.

01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:55.640
However, you agree that humans aren't worth living and God is going to kill them all.

01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:56.640
Correct?

01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:57.640
Well, yeah.

01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:02.320
And he, you know, he's sort of evidence for this that he's basing it on is that it seems

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:09.960
like only Christians are interested in fighting the Christian zealotry war that he's, the

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:12.080
crusade that he's imagining.

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:15.080
It seems odd that this Christian crusade is only backed by Christians.

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:16.080
Right.

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:17.420
And so that's strange to him.

01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:22.320
And it's proof that everyone else is meant to die in God's plan.

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.400
I think that that's really fucked up.

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:25.400
Yeah.

01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:30.080
I think he went from, I think I'm going to join the dark side to, I think I am the dark

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:35.120
side very quickly without seeming to realize that he was doing it.

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:36.120
No.

01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:40.560
And that is not him being like performancey and on the dark side because his version of

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:45.880
performance of the dark side to be like, you should put this in your body.

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:50.880
It wouldn't be all non-Christians seem like they're destined for death and that's just

01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:51.880
God's plan.

01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:52.880
Yeah.

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:55.280
Isn't he the guy who says that Islam is violent?

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.280
Yes.

01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:57.280
Yes.

01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:58.280
I cool.

01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:06.080
I do think that at any point, maybe I was being hyperbolic when I said the GOP is ISIS,

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:09.480
but Dan Wolf, this is ISIS.

01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:10.480
Yeah.

01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:18.280
He's a ways down that road, at least in terms of ideology and thought and hopes.

01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:20.320
And let's hope not deeds.

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:27.920
Now this was interesting to me because that's kind of it for this thing that he was intending

01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:28.920
to do.

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:29.920
Sure, sure, sure.

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:35.000
He had this great idea of like performatively becoming the dark side and then he immediately

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:42.480
said something incredibly dark and did embody what I would think is coming to a dark side.

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:49.920
But now that he's done with that, Alex tells a story that I think does not make the point

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.780
that he wants it to make.

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:57.080
I think that he sounds like an asshole in this story.

01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:59.440
They're in fantasy land, they're losers.

01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:01.960
They're not the resistance, they're the establishment.

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:10.400
And they're I mean, I had this guy this weekend, Sunday, I went for a walk down at Zilker Park

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:16.720
and I'm walking along the creek there that dumps in the Colorado River.

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:22.840
And I see this guy, you know, about twenty five, kind of the academic type anti fun.

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.120
He's got his, you know, his beard, everything academic and he's wearing a black top black

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:28.120
pants.

01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:29.120
But no, no anti stuff I could see.

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:31.920
But I could tell and see I was looking at my looks.

01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:35.480
And then he starts walking towards me at an angle like he's going to hit me, he's going

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:36.920
to do something.

01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:39.680
And so as he starts coming towards me menacing, I just couldn't help it.

01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:43.520
I just instinctively started walking over and I was getting ready to just drive his

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:44.520
ass to the ground.

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:45.520
He was stupid.

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:46.520
I'm taking swing.

01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:50.080
It was just instinctive that I started like a magnet coming to him and I was going to

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:53.280
knock his ass down on that ground hard.

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:55.720
And at the last minute, he kind of went like that and then looked scared.

01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:57.860
It's like, yeah, dude, this isn't fantasy world.

01:41:57.860 --> 01:41:58.860
This isn't LARPing.

01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:00.760
You're about to get hurt bad.

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:07.480
It sounds like Alex just threatened a guy randomly that he imagined was, wished him

01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:10.800
ill and was academic Antifa types.

01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:13.080
This is, this is scary.

01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:16.640
So let me see if I can get the details of this story correctly.

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:19.780
And I'm going to do this from the point of a neutral observer.

01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:22.080
So I'm in a different angle.

01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:23.080
Maybe you're a birdwatcher.

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:25.760
Just hanging out, not doing much.

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:26.760
I see Alex.

01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:34.320
I see Alex Jones over there just shaking because he's Alex, uh, just visibly just vibrating.

01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:39.320
And then I see a guy over there, uh, probably a little way fish wearing glasses.

01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:41.040
He's got a black shirt on.

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:43.940
He's got black shorts on Antifa type.

01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:50.520
And then he just starts walking away and then, uh, Alex Jones visibly shaking, starts walking

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:54.220
directly towards him and almost throws a fist at him.

01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:57.080
And I'm supposed to think, oh, well, it's the Antifa guy's fault.

01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:02.320
Well, at the last minute, the Antifa guy looked like he was about to get hit by somebody.

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.320
Yes.

01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:10.360
And then all of a sudden he's so subservient, he's so scared of the clear threatening vibe

01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:11.360
I was giving off.

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:16.480
I'm going to go with Alex Jones suddenly running towards me on a day where I was just reading

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:17.480
at the park.

01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:18.760
He's going to make me go away.

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:25.120
In that story, I don't hear any clear indication that Alex's violence was in response to any

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:31.160
real violence or threatening-ness of this person who was just on the trail.

01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:35.560
And Alex has decided because they're wearing black and have a beard, are academic Antifa.

01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:36.560
Right.

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:37.560
Right.

01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:38.560
Whatever the fuck that means.

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:39.880
Alex seems like he's a threat to people.

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:46.360
It does seem like what he just said was, if I feel a bad vibe, I will kill someone.

01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:49.840
If you're wearing black, you're probably Antifa and I might fucking hit you.

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:52.720
I might just fucking haul off and beat the shit out of you.

01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:53.720
Yeah.

01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:54.720
Yeah.

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:55.720
Yeah.

01:43:55.720 --> 01:44:00.720
And if you act like it's weird that I'm about to hit you or maybe you duck and cower, then

01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:04.160
I'm going to be like, why are you emotionally manipulating me?

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:05.160
Yeah.

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:06.160
Yeah.

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:07.720
Why are you acting like someone's about to hit you?

01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:09.320
You were about to hit me.

01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:10.320
Okay.

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:11.320
Jeez.

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:12.320
Okay.

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:14.240
Anyway, Alex has a lot of fantasies.

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:17.600
One is the academic Antifa is trying to get them on the trail.

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:23.040
Another is that in the near future, his books, I guess he's written a couple of books sort

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:31.680
of anyway, his show will be contraband and you can record this and you can save this

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:39.000
and in that dystopic future, you won't be able to find it on the cloud or online.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:44.760
You'll have to have contraband old devices that your smart devices were fused, even allowed

01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:45.760
to be plugged in.

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:48.840
You'll have to go through a lot of hoops to even have this saved.

01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:52.600
So I would suggest you transcribe it.

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:58.640
And in the future, you'll have to hide it in the near future.

01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:03.920
In the near future, I would love it for Alex to like go to Europe and see like a wall sockets

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:08.200
and be like, it's happened already.

01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:18.520
Is this AC or DC nothing means anything anymore.

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:20.320
What a dumb dumb.

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:25.720
Anyway, in this next clip, the only thing I would say about that last thing is just

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:30.760
like, this is just such a desire to be forbidden or whatever.

01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:32.560
He's just so into that idea.

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:37.440
I think it's probably from one too many bad sci-fi novels.

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:41.840
So we talk a lot about Alex's bizarre morality.

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:49.440
This idea of sort of galactic rules and stuff.

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:52.360
Mike down for this next clip, because he talks about it a little bit more.

01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:57.680
And this is something I really need your help with, because this is another clue about how

01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:02.680
this moral system works, but it doesn't make sense.

01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:04.840
You're not injected with one microchip.

01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:12.080
You're injected with hundreds of little tiny ones that all have the same amount of data

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:17.080
on them that a chip 10 years ago had.

01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:19.960
And you're saying, well, why don't they just spray it out of helicopters or out of planes?

01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:22.840
Then we ingest it and breathe it.

01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:29.720
Metaphysically, they're not allowed to do that historically.

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.880
They have to get you under pressure to do it.

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:34.620
They've got to leave a way out for you on a skate patch.

01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:37.680
But they need to force you to do it.

01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:39.040
It's a push.

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:45.480
But then it becomes a shove once God removes the barrier hedge.

01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:50.000
And then, yes, they will put it in your water, put it in your food, put it everywhere.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:58.120
So God has a barrier hedge to this sort of free will thing.

01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:03.980
The devil, once God says, eh, go ahead, then the devil can go ahead and just mess with

01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:05.160
your free will.

01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:10.920
And that's why there's chemtrails, I guess, because God is like, yeah, that hedge is gone.

01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:11.920
Fuck it.

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:12.920
Who cares?

01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:13.920
Yeah.

01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:14.920
I think if I understand what he's saying—

01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:16.600
Because Alex does believe in chemtrails.

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:17.600
Yes, he does.

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:18.600
Yes.

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:19.600
Yes.

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:20.600
But you can't spray things randomly.

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:21.600
No, no, no.

01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:22.600
Targeted.

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:24.080
God removed that hedge already.

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:25.200
Right, right, right, right.

01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:31.380
So I think, if I understand correctly, I think what he's saying is that the devil, the literal

01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:37.120
Christian devil, which is real and is running Biden's campaign still somehow, it can't—

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:38.120
And might have called Steve.

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:40.120
Yes, and might have called Steve.

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:42.120
China called, and so did the devil.

01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:43.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:44.120
Both.

01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:45.120
Steve got two phone calls.

01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:47.480
Oh, the devil said he wasn't doing well.

01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:51.080
So he can push you, right?

01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:57.280
And God will stop him from going too far unless you've given a little bit of like a, hey,

01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:01.960
maybe I'll go along with the devil, and then God will remove that final ring of protection,

01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:04.000
and then you will be thrown into the abyss.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.920
I don't think that's what he's saying.

01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:14.080
I think that—I don't know if—I don't—I'm not certain, based on the things that I've

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:18.240
heard, that this hedge of protection that God has—

01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:19.240
Sure.

01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:24.820
I'm not certain that that is, like, relies on your choice.

01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:31.600
It has to, because you have to have the way out, and you have to be able to—so you have

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:32.600
to choose the devil.

01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:34.200
But how do chemtrails work, then?

01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:36.680
Well, you chose to look up.

01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:39.000
But it doesn't matter if I look up.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.720
According to them, you're breathing in all these, like, these aluminums and whatever

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:46.080
the fuck in the air.

01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.640
That is something that you can't escape.

01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:55.520
You did not make any choice that—that is something that is completely above your will.

01:48:55.520 --> 01:49:00.040
You did not agree to that, therefore it's an infringement of your will.

01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:03.120
Right, but it hasn't been primed yet.

01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:06.280
It's just like a bomb without a timer, you know?

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:10.000
You've just got all the stuff in you, and then you have to believe something, and then

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000
they'll activate it.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:12.000
No.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000
No.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000
I can't imagine that.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
I'm struggling.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.120
This makes less than zero sense.

01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:18.720
Yeah, I don't understand this new wrinkle to it.

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:19.720
Yeah, I don't like it.

01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:21.520
But there's another wrinkle, and that is—

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:22.520
So soon?

01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:23.520
Yes.

01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:24.520
Oh, God.

01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:26.160
And that is that you can't do things to kids.

01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:29.840
But I think from the context of this, Alex is talking about vaccines.

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:30.840
Yes.

01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:36.160
Now, the real ultimate sin here is, though, they target children before they are of age

01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:38.800
to make the discernment.

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:45.960
And so that's why the Satanists are so cursed, is they cheat and they lie to themselves.

01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:46.960
Why can they cheat then?

01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:51.960
And they break the metaphysical rule that they are not allowed to hurt innocents.

01:49:51.960 --> 01:50:01.720
They're only allowed to get adults to not support themselves and to make a bad decision

01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:06.320
to receive the spiritual interdimensional transmission from Satan.

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:07.320
So it's real simple.

01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:08.320
They're tuned into the security channel.

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:09.320
It's real simple!

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.320
They like it.

01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:11.320
They like it.

01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:12.320
It's real simple!

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:13.320
They like the Satan channel.

01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:17.360
I want to be a ruler and I want somebody to slap his hands whenever he's like, they can

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:18.360
cheat.

01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:19.360
Mm-hmm.

01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:20.360
No.

01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:21.360
You said they can't cheat.

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:22.360
But that's why they're cursed.

01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:23.360
Yeah, but you said they can't cheat.

01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:24.360
Well—

01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:28.760
I mean, if they're already cursed, then why wouldn't you just continue cheating?

01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:33.040
There's no greater punishment after hell, right?

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:34.040
Right.

01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:37.280
So if you've already cheated, why would you then be like, well, we still have to follow

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:38.280
the rules of chemtrail?

01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:40.040
If you cheat, you're cursed, but you're not going to hell.

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:41.040
You're cursed.

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:42.040
What?

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:43.040
Oh.

01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:45.360
Well, I guess I retract all of my arguments.

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:48.680
That makes you smile weird, and Alex can pick you out of a crowd.

01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:49.680
That's fair.

01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:50.680
Those are the problems with being cursed.

01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:52.200
Alright, you can't be a daywalker anymore.

01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:53.200
I gotcha.

01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:58.480
Because I think what he's saying is that they're getting around the cosmic rules, because these

01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:04.780
children are agreeing to get vaccinated, but they don't know any better.

01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:05.780
So it's like—

01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:10.560
Who's making cosmic rules with loopholes that big?

01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:11.560
I don't know.

01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.440
There's only one person.

01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:18.880
Also, I would suggest that if this is some kind of thing that really curses you, having

01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:24.040
children make decisions that they're unable to understand, what about baptism?

01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:25.040
What about child baptism?

01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:26.520
Shouldn't that be a problem for them?

01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:27.520
No, no, no.

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:29.840
Because the children can choose that, and that's good.

01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:34.760
But, I mean, I understand that subjectively you would say that that is a good decision

01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:37.840
as opposed to getting a vaccine, which you think is a bad decision, which you're being

01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:38.840
tricked into.

01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:39.840
Right.

01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:44.760
But externally, from the view of the universe, these are both things that this child cannot

01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:45.760
decide.

01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:47.120
No, you can't trick a kid towards God.

01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:48.760
That's the other cosmic rule.

01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:52.240
You can only go towards—if you get baptized, you've meant to.

01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:53.240
Right.

01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:54.240
It just seems weird.

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.240
Yeah.

01:51:55.240 --> 01:52:00.100
I just don't understand what it is exactly that makes those acts different outside of

01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:01.100
wanting them to be different.

01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:06.280
See, I just don't understand why you would want to be involved in any of that.

01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:07.280
Like I don't want—

01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:08.280
This morality?

01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:09.280
Yeah!

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:12.680
I don't want to be—I don't want to be good in this morality.

01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:18.220
This seems even more—being good seems even more somehow evil in his morality.

01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:19.880
And it's all incredibly confusing.

01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:20.880
In coherence!

01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:21.880
How can you live on a day-to-day—

01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:22.880
From day to day.

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:23.880
Yeah, right?

01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:24.880
It's like, I don't know.

01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:25.880
I might be the devil.

01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:26.880
I don't know.

01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:32.160
How do you make small moral choices like, hmm, should I tell my wife she looks pretty

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:35.360
today or do I have to be 100% honest?

01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:39.640
Is me telling her she looks pretty going to take away her free will to dress herself as

01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:40.640
she so chooses?

01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:41.640
Exactly!

01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:42.640
Am I the devil?

01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:43.640
Oh, man.

01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:44.640
Yeah.

01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:45.640
Woof.

01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:46.640
Yeah, there's almost—it's paralyzing.

01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:47.640
Yeah.

01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:48.640
Yeah, that's terrifying.

01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:49.640
Yeah.

01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:52.940
But, look, anyway, the devil, he has weird rules.

01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:53.940
The devil's followers—

01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:54.940
So does God.

01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:55.940
—are cursed.

01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:56.940
Yeah.

01:52:56.940 --> 01:52:57.940
But hey, man—

01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:58.940
So are God's.

01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:01.440
But we've gotten to where we've gotten, right?

01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:05.240
And the more you—you just gotta resist.

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:12.880
And the enemy's biggest leg up is that what they're doing is so focused, so diabolical,

01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:23.400
so over-the-top that people just have real trouble grasping it, and they project their

01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:28.320
own mindset onto the establishment.

01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:29.800
And people don't want to face this.

01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:32.040
People don't want to know the big truth.

01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:37.320
They think that they can just deny it, and it's like a problem that's gonna go away.

01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:44.480
It's a foul.

01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:50.520
And so the more you resist, the quicker this is gonna be over with.

01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:54.440
We're still gonna go through the fire.

01:53:54.440 --> 01:54:02.220
But acquiescing to what's coming is going to destroy you.

01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:08.040
So when I hear that, I hear something along the lines of like, you know, hey, let's all

01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:09.040
burn.

01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:10.040
Yeah.

01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:12.800
The more you fight, the better it'll be.

01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:15.280
So why not join an insurgency of some sort?

01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:18.920
If I don't get what I want, everyone's going to die.

01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:19.920
Yeah.

01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:20.920
Yeah.

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:21.920
I mean, the fire.

01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:22.920
I—

01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:25.080
It's a cleansing fire, as Alex has referred to it.

01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:27.840
I want to throw a flag.

01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:32.560
I want there to be a ten-yard penalty for him being like, people project onto the establishment

01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:35.680
because things are too difficult for them to understand, and then they want to live

01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:36.680
in denial.

01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:39.120
I want to throw a flag on that.

01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:40.280
You can't say it.

01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:41.280
Yeah.

01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:44.600
So Alex veers off from this path of like, fire.

01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:46.120
We'll all live through the fire.

01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:47.120
Fire will come.

01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:53.040
He wants to hit on some of his sort of modern talking points, some of these villains.

01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:57.080
All these articles about looking forward to the end of humanity, and Klaus Schwab is like,

01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:59.060
it's going to be so good for you.

01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:01.920
You are going to drink sewage.

01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:02.920
These are actual quotes.

01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:10.640
You are going to drink sewage and eat weeds, and there will not be any more people in it.

01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:16.720
It's good for Earth, and again, you will be drinking this sewage.

01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:18.520
He's saying this in German, by the way.

01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:20.800
He only lives in German.

01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:21.800
With a Russian accent, of course.

01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:24.840
Most of his speeches are in other languages, but you can read the transcripts, it's in

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:25.840
the news today.

01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:26.840
I'm not kidding.

01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:31.420
So I think that's one of those things that's really easy to see through, like what he's

01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:33.360
lying about.

01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:34.360
These are direct quotes.

01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:37.480
Well, I mean, it's like, yeah, okay.

01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:39.520
I will feed you dog turds.

01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:40.640
This is what you will do.

01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:42.000
These are actual quotes, by the way.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Without-

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.760
I am telling you, I am in Germany, by the way.

01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:46.800
I am a German man.

01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:52.880
Without even doing any looking into any of this, it would be so easy for someone to be

01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:58.480
like, oh yeah, he's talking about sewage treatment plants, turning that into potable water, and

01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:03.080
the potential of weeds as being a cultivatable food source.

01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:08.320
Think of turning things that we usually think of as not good into things that are good.

01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:09.320
That's called progress.

01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:14.000
Right, and weeds are things that grow without any human intervention.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.680
If there were a way that you could turn that into food source, it would be amazing.

01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:20.100
It would be something that would be really great.

01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:23.600
Renewable water is something that will be increasingly important in the future.

01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:26.780
Imagine if food was an invasive species, just food.

01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:30.920
It's not like Klaus Schwab is coming in and being like, eat this dandelion and this cup

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:31.920
of piss.

01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:35.200
I shall feed you all manner of poop.

01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:38.400
Yeah, so silly.

01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:42.040
Anyway, Alex is very serious.

01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:43.040
Yes.

01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:48.920
You're talking about foreign language speeches that Klaus Schwab gives, and his next subject

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:50.400
is just as serious.

01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:53.640
I've already burned through this segment, I haven't got any of the clips I want to get

01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:54.640
to.

01:56:54.640 --> 01:57:00.720
We'll cover all the election fraud and that nightmare and where that's going next hour.

01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:04.880
But everybody's flipping out about this video that's up on Infowars.com.

01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:05.880
Flipping out.

01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:08.360
From last night, we should probably repost the article.

01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:16.000
But a COVID prediction from Project Runway in March of last year.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:25.760
So a full 10, 11 months before it was even named that or on the radar.

01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:33.760
But again, where do the globalists like to put stuff in fashion and in movies and in

01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:34.760
culture?

01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:40.960
I'm going to tell you, like some serial killers will do that.

01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:45.480
This is so dumb.

01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:46.480
You know what?

01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:51.480
My instinct whenever somebody's like, uh, Project Runway predicts something in March

01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:54.280
of last year is just to go, nah, get the fuck out of here.

01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:57.880
But when it gets paid off with where do the globalists put things?

01:57:57.880 --> 01:57:58.880
Fashion shows.

01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:00.320
It's in Project Runway.

01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:03.000
That's where they hide all of their secrets, Dan.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Yeah.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:10.320
Bob comes up with an evil plan to make people eat sewage and then Tim Gunn says, make it

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:11.320
happen.

01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:13.320
I think that's his catchphrase.

01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:14.320
I can't remember.

01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:15.320
Pretty sure.

01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:16.320
Make it work.

01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:17.320
Make it work.

01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:18.320
That sounds right.

01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:19.320
I think that's what it is.

01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:20.320
I have not seen that show in a very long time.

01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:25.720
But an ex of mine from years past loved that and I watched a fuck ton of that show.

01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:27.120
Is that where you first heard about COVID?

01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:28.120
What?

01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:29.120
No, I didn't watch that season.

01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:30.120
Oh, okay.

01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:31.120
I looked into this though.

01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:33.160
Of course you looked into it.

01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:40.400
But there was a contestant whose name was COVID with a K, which is a Sanskrit word.

01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:42.160
I'm already off the train.

01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:45.280
And so there was a challenge called the head to toe challenge.

01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:48.920
We had to make an outfit that involved the head to the feet.

01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:49.920
An entire outfit.

01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:50.920
All right.

01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:52.680
So it's a guy named COVID creating a bodysuit.

01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:56.240
Well, no, but the outfit involved a mask.

01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.600
And so like COVID made a mask.

01:58:58.600 --> 01:58:59.600
Yes.

01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:00.600
Yeah.

01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:01.600
I got it.

01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:02.600
It's a fucking game show.

01:59:02.600 --> 01:59:03.600
It is.

01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:04.600
It's great.

01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:05.600
We all have a great time.

01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:06.600
It's a game show.

01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:09.800
And if you wanted to take a really easy route, you could maybe make a hat, but the mask is

01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:14.440
something that may be a little bit more adventurous, maybe a little more difficult to pull off

01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:15.440
as an outfit.

01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:19.020
And it just so happened that the person's name was COVID with a K, which is not the

01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:20.020
same word.

01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:21.020
Who cares?

01:59:21.020 --> 01:59:25.780
Are you sure the globalist didn't plant a person named COVID to make a mask in order

01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:31.520
to give us the cosmic realization that eventually a pandemic would be coming named COVID and

01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:40.280
they will be using masks in order to turn us into their own models on project no fun

01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:41.280
way.

01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:44.320
Really, quite frankly, the laugh they're having is huge.

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:45.320
It's very large.

01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:46.320
Yeah.

01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:47.320
But you know what's also really interesting?

01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:49.200
If it's anything like mine, it's very big.

01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:54.800
You know what also is really interesting is they couldn't laugh unless Alex found out.

01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:58.280
Like unless Alex reported on this, the globalists couldn't laugh about this.

01:59:58.280 --> 01:59:59.280
It's a real bummer.

01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:00.280
Yeah.

02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:02.040
I don't think that's too subtle for anyone to get.

02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:03.040
Yeah.

02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:04.040
Oh, they need Alex.

02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:05.040
Yeah.

02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:06.520
They're in a terrible dance of death.

02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:07.520
But Alex doesn't need them.

02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:08.520
I really think he does.

02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:09.520
They're demons.

02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:10.520
They're vampires.

02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:11.520
But he's a demon.

02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:12.520
Well, but they're vampires.

02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:13.520
Okay.

02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:14.520
Well, that's true.

02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:18.760
By the way, you know, there's paintings of Count Dracula, spitting image of Prince Charles.

02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:23.680
So see, I could say a lot, I could do a lot here, but just you need to understand what

02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:24.680
you're-

02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:33.480
Blood drinking, child killing, pedophile murderers.

02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:43.560
So you can either fight them or you can roll over and die to them.

02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:44.560
Like Count Dracula.

02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:49.880
But he wants to put his genetics into your blood.

02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:52.420
He wants to defile you.

02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:58.540
He wants to put his material into your cells and overwrite your cell, cell by cell.

02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:04.720
It's not a flying saucer crashed out in Antarctica in the movie The Thing.

02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:05.720
There are paintings of The Thing as well.

02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:08.600
It's coming out of a Chinese laboratory.

02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:11.140
No paintings.

02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:17.120
It's not the movie The Hunger where they look under the microscope and they see the vampire

02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:19.280
cell taking over the other cell.

02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:20.280
I didn't see that one.

02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:21.640
I'll have to check it out.

02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:23.760
It's not a David Bowie movie.

02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:25.040
Excellent film, by the way.

02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:26.400
Which David Bowie movie?

02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:30.760
It's the real world, boys and girls.

02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:35.480
I want to hit two things here in a moment, but let me just do this.

02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:37.040
I need money to fight this war.

02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:38.040
Cool.

02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:39.040
Love it.

02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:40.040
Love it.

02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.040
Love it.

02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:44.600
I need money to fight these vampires.

02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:48.520
Honestly, wooden stakes are expensive as hell.

02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:53.760
And you should see the fucking garlic bills at Info War Studio.

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:58.720
You know, that's something that most vampire movies that have stuck with the old ways.

02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:00.000
It's very cost effective.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.720
You can find cheap stake material just about anywhere.

02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:07.480
The later Blade movies where you have to have high tech stuff and the underworld movies

02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:08.840
where you have to do all that stuff.

02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:12.560
But even then, still, stays the same, basically.

02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:14.240
Put a stake through its heart.

02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:16.960
Sunlight, steak, garlic.

02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:18.480
Garlic keeps them away.

02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:19.480
Yeah.

02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:20.480
I have a little garlic garlic.

02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:21.480
You got a little garlic.

02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:22.480
That's why we're...

02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:23.480
Our studio's totally safe from vampires.

02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:24.480
Totally vampire free.

02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:25.480
Yeah.

02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:29.440
I'm not scared of these things that Alex is really worried about, because I have some

02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:30.440
garlic around.

02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:31.440
I have garlic.

02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.440
I've got wood.

02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:33.440
We're good to go.

02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:34.440
Yep.

02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:36.240
And I have a not black cat.

02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:37.240
That's true.

02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:38.240
So...

02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:40.240
Although Celine could be a vampire.

02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:41.240
Yeah, probably.

02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:42.240
She's drawn some blood.

02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:44.720
She lost her eye to... could be a vampire fight.

02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:46.480
Or she could have been fighting a lycanthrope.

02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:54.840
Anyway, Alex, he ended that last clip with a plug, because of course he did.

02:02:54.840 --> 02:03:02.560
And this leads to him doing a long plug, an ad, and also a convoluted story about why

02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:06.080
he's not selling super blue anymore.

02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:09.920
Eagle-eared listeners will remember that the reason is because he got a cease and desist

02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:13.000
letter from the Attorney General of New York.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:14.000
There's more to it than that.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.680
Oh, there certainly is.

02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:19.480
We have the charcoal toothpaste that's super high quality and concentrated.

02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:20.480
That is amazing.

02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:21.480
Turned your mouth black.

02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:24.520
We had it in the pipeline for about a year and a half before we even started selling.

02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:28.880
People said, well, will you stop selling your super blue and your whitening toothpaste?

02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:33.280
Yeah, because the national media lied and said that I said it was a COVID cure and tried

02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:36.280
to get me arrested.

02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:39.000
And still trying, but after this and everything.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:44.280
And the problem is if I sell it, they'll lie again and say, he's selling a cure.

02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:47.960
And all these people flooded to buy it thinking it's a cure because they're saying it's cure.

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:52.560
Then they try to get affidavits from them thinking they bought a cure to indict me.

02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:54.400
That's why we don't have that available for you.

02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:57.920
Because of the criminal activity of the Democratic Party and Leticia James in New York.

02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:02.720
I mean, these are savage mafia dons that murder old people in nursing homes on purpose.

02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:04.840
I mean, I'm up against murderers.

02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:11.840
I feel like if everybody's lying about how you're selling this stuff, that's not a reason

02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:12.840
to stop.

02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:14.960
They just don't do the things that they're saying.

02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:19.960
Well, if you're not doing those things, then just keep selling the product.

02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:22.520
If you have nothing to fear, then you have nothing to fear.

02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:23.920
Like I don't give a shit.

02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:30.960
There's no affidavit that someone could file that would say, I was under the impression

02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:33.880
that this would stop me from getting COVID-19.

02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:39.800
If you didn't do anything to make them think that, that affidavit would fail in court.

02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:45.760
Then those affidavits directly quote you as having said something, and then they go and

02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:48.420
they look and you said that stuff.

02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:49.840
That's the reason to stop selling the stuff.

02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:50.840
That's when you stop selling.

02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:51.840
Yeah, yeah.

02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:53.720
You wouldn't keep doing it if there was no problem.

02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:54.720
Weird.

02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:55.720
That's a problem, yeah.

02:04:55.720 --> 02:05:01.780
So Alex doesn't mention this specifically on the episode, but Project Veritas has a

02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:04.760
new little thing going on.

02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:06.360
I didn't watch it because I don't care.

02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:07.360
Don't care.

02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:08.360
Fuck them.

02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:09.360
Yeah.

02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:18.480
Unfortunately, James O'Keefe may have gotten on a CNN morning editorial call and live streamed

02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:19.480
it.

02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:22.560
So he's like, yeah, Jeff Zucker coming for you.

02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:26.320
We can get into the places where you think you're private and like...

02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:28.840
And they're all like...

02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:29.840
We have lawyers.

02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:32.040
Could you not be here or we'll sue you?

02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:33.160
I don't know what to tell you.

02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:34.160
Get out!

02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:37.040
I hope that doesn't blow up in James O'Keefe's face at all.

02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:38.040
Really do.

02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:39.040
Again, being facetious.

02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:40.040
Get him.

02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:41.040
Get him.

02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:45.440
Alex doesn't mention this stuff, but he does have a weird out of nowhere obsession with

02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:46.440
Jeff Zucker.

02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:47.440
Odd.

02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:48.440
Which seems to be related.

02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:49.440
Yeah.

02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:51.600
Look at the photo of Jeff Zucker.

02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:53.040
Looks just like Brian Stelter.

02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:54.280
The little...

02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:56.320
He's so in love with himself.

02:05:56.320 --> 02:05:57.960
Just oh, he's so satisfied.

02:05:57.960 --> 02:06:03.640
Oh, they drive him in a limo and oh, he makes millions of dollars and oh, he's Jeff Zucker.

02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:04.640
He's a joke.

02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:11.600
And by the way, he knows he's a joke.

02:06:11.600 --> 02:06:13.780
A smug nobody.

02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:15.880
And that's why he wants to bring you down.

02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:19.520
He hates you when you have a good Christmas.

02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:20.520
He hates...

02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:23.520
He hates you when you pray to God.

02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:26.800
He hates you because you've got a wonderful wife and children.

02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:34.240
He will never be a good person because he is a filthy, degenerate sack of evil.

02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:36.800
That's a little much.

02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:38.800
Little much.

02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:46.900
I can't say that that was intended to be antisemitic, but holy shit, is that trafficking and antisemitism.

02:06:46.900 --> 02:06:50.680
That's dripping in classical.

02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:52.320
He hates you when you have a good Christmas.

02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:57.160
He hates you when you have a good Christmas.

02:06:57.160 --> 02:07:01.400
He loves it when you have a good birthday, but he hates it when you have a good Christmas.

02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:02.400
So ridiculous.

02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:04.360
Very neutral on Arbor Day.

02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:05.360
I don't know.

02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:09.120
I mean, I know that Jeff Zucker is somebody that Alex has brought up in the past.

02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:13.940
He's not somebody who's a complete stranger to Alex's world, but he's definitely not someone

02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:15.240
who's front and center for Alex.

02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:17.760
No, he's right-wing du jour, if you will.

02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:21.620
Yeah, but the focus is very glaring.

02:07:21.620 --> 02:07:25.520
It's very apparent that like, oh, I'm going to try and catch some of the weak.

02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:26.920
That's what I'm saying.

02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:28.800
He's today's boogeyman.

02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:34.040
But, I think that even Alex recognizes that James O'Keefe's stuff is best to stay away

02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:35.040
from.

02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:36.040
He didn't reference it this time.

02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:40.280
Yeah, and he's not having James on, which he has all of these other times.

02:07:40.280 --> 02:07:41.600
I think he's like, ugh.

02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:42.880
This one might be too much.

02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:46.480
I don't even know if it's like, consequences, it just might be like, I don't know, this

02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:47.480
is a little soft.

02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:48.480
That's fair.

02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:50.960
Best to stay away, but let's kick Jeff Zucker.

02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:52.240
Well, why not?

02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:53.240
Yeah.

02:07:53.240 --> 02:07:58.880
Alex thinks that the best way for Trump to remain president is to just do it.

02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:03.600
I don't think Trump should even punt to the electors and the legislatures.

02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:08.880
I think he should go with the American people, resolute desk, show all this evidence, and

02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:12.960
say, stand with me, American people, say no to this.

02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:15.340
I know I'm going to D.C. on the 12th.

02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:19.100
I know I'm going to that event, and by the way, I'm taking that big march over.

02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:20.520
We started it before.

02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:21.980
These women hijacked it.

02:08:21.980 --> 02:08:22.980
Now they're saying it again.

02:08:22.980 --> 02:08:25.800
You can't even hear them on their microphone when 500,000 are there.

02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:26.800
I'll be there.

02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:27.800
We'll march to the White House.

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:28.800
It's going to be great.

02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:29.800
I'll see you there.

02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:30.800
There weren't 500,000 people there.

02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:32.920
Also, you co-opted their event.

02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:33.920
Yeah.

02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:34.920
They had the permit.

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:35.920
They were there.

02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:36.920
They organized the event.

02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:37.920
They did all the work.

02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:38.920
Yeah, you might have brought some people.

02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:39.920
You drove there.

02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:40.920
Good for you.

02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:41.920
Good for you.

02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:42.920
Attracting a crowd.

02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:46.560
You still stole their event, and you're going to do that again and pretend that they're

02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:50.360
stealing your event when they organized it and have the permits.

02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:51.360
Holy shit.

02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:59.280
So yeah, I think that Alex is on his way to another Tea Party, and I think it's interesting

02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:01.560
that we know his trends.

02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:03.780
We know his patterns of behavior.

02:09:03.780 --> 02:09:08.080
We know what he did with the Tea Party, more or less, claiming that they were co-opting

02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:10.660
his movement and what have you.

02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:16.980
And I think you can see it happening a little bit again, on a smaller scale, at least at

02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:23.360
this point, because the people who are having these rallies in DC are just sort of remnants

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:24.840
of Tea Party people.

02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:27.920
They just don't dress up as fun anymore.

02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:34.120
Yeah, now we're at a point where Alex is probably more hooked up with the fringe and the sizable

02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:35.120
crowds.

02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:36.120
True.

02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:37.120
True.

02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:41.040
So he might actually be able to co-op them far more successfully than his attempts to

02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:46.600
take over Glenn Beck's shit, when Glenn Beck was on TV and Alex was the voice in the woods.

02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:54.360
But, I think one of the parts of what Alex, you know, his credibility now is he's best

02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:56.740
friends with Roger Stone.

02:09:56.740 --> 02:10:03.040
And just like we had Steve come in on December 1st, now we have Steve.

02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:05.080
Now we have different Steve.

02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:06.080
Other Steve.

02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:07.080
Yes.

02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:10.000
You'll understand why that slip of the tongue happened, because Roger's swinging.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Okay, good.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.560
But, and for the fences, I don't mean like a Liberty.

02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:14.560
No, no, no, no.

02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:15.560
He's going for it.

02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:21.320
Um, the first clip is the bad kind of a swing and that is, uh, Hey man, yeah, fucking martial

02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:22.320
law.

02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:23.320
Cool.

02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:24.320
Great.

02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:27.960
Uh, and I think the president has to have all options on the table as to how he proceeds.

02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:31.780
The one thing he cannot do, Alex, is quit.

02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:35.880
He has powerful forces arrayed against him.

02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:38.960
Uh, it is, uh, it is extraordinary.

02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:43.120
Let's call them the armies of the Pharaoh, the Pharaoh's armies.

02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:45.960
Uh, but this is God's nation.

02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:49.560
I believe he was selected for God for this job.

02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:55.760
I pray to God every day that he will not, uh, not only not quit, but he will be strengthened

02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:56.760
in his resolve.

02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:57.760
Yeah.

02:10:57.760 --> 02:10:58.760
Go tell Nixon about it.

02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:01.100
Oh boy.

02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:05.920
I just love the idea of like, Hey Roger, uh, like in, you know, like the seventies and

02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:07.800
go back there and be like, this is going to be you.

02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:09.400
This is going to be you.

02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:12.420
God chose you for this.

02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:13.420
Live your life.

02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:14.420
Shit bag.

02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:15.420
Yeah.

02:11:15.420 --> 02:11:16.420
Yeah.

02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:17.420
Enjoy the next 40 years of your life.

02:11:17.420 --> 02:11:18.420
Knowing that this is what you end up.

02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:19.840
Oh, that would be great.

02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:20.840
This next clip.

02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:21.840
Jordan.

02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:22.840
Yes.

02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:23.840
Maybe one of my favorite swings.

02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:24.840
Mm hmm.

02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:28.720
I can't like, Steve's had some big ones just about himself.

02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:31.120
Like most of Steve's stuff is like really braggadocio.

02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:34.560
It's really just, I am the most important person.

02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:36.200
I've done everything important.

02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:37.200
Yeah.

02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:39.280
I overthrew a Ghana twice.

02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:40.280
Yeah.

02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:44.280
And then when Steve comes in, man, Roger comes in again.

02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:45.280
You're doing it again.

02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:46.600
Well, it's because of the swing.

02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:47.600
Okay.

02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:48.600
Let's hear it.

02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:57.240
I just learned of, uh, absolute incontrovertible evidence of North Korean boats delivering,

02:11:57.240 --> 02:12:00.600
uh, ballots through a Harbor in Maine.

02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:01.600
Yes.

02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:02.600
The state agreed.

02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:09.120
Uh, if this checks out, if law enforcement looked, if this checks out to be true, it

02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:14.400
would be proof of foreign involvement in the election.

02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:17.000
This is North Korean.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.840
This is the best North Korean boat.

02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:20.840
Let me walk through this.

02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:23.640
Our North Korean.

02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:28.760
They arrived in Maine, Maine to deliver North.

02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:29.760
Hold on.

02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:30.760
Okay.

02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:31.760
In the world.

02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:37.120
They had to come by boat to deliver this fake ballot.

02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:39.880
Man.

02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:47.280
So the number of questions raises brings this claim into the territory of farce.

02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:48.280
That is a swing.

02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:49.720
That is a swing for the fences.

02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:54.800
If this is a sprawling conspiracy involving tons of countries and us actors, why did North

02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:55.800
Korea have the ballots?

02:12:55.800 --> 02:12:58.600
Why couldn't they have been printed domestically?

02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:01.560
Why would these conspirators need to print the ballots in North Korea?

02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:05.840
Then have the country that's under the heaviest surveillance and under very strict embargoes

02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:11.920
carry out a delivery by sea, which would obviously raise alarms no matter what the cargo was.

02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:17.960
Also you were sort of, why would they arrive in Maine?

02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:21.800
Does Roger not realize that in order for a North Korean boat to reach Maine, they would

02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:33.320
need to either navigate South of Africa, then head North or transit through the Panama canal.

02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:37.840
North Korea would have a much easier, but still almost ridiculously impossible time

02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:42.040
getting a boat to the West coast, like some state on the West coast, since they're shorelines

02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:44.720
on the sea of Japan, which leads to the Pacific ocean.

02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:48.960
If we're just imagining that these North Korean boats can show up wherever they want, then

02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:50.680
why wouldn't they go to Hawaii?

02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:52.600
That's definitely their closest shot.

02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:57.680
Literally, there could not be a more complicated coastal state for North Korea to get to than

02:13:57.680 --> 02:13:59.240
Maine by boat.

02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:01.040
How did he choose that one?

02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:04.720
So if this is true, shouldn't this be intensely embarrassing for Trump?

02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:08.400
Like that dude bent over backwards trying to impress and appease Kim Jong Un, and now

02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:12.800
in Trump's hour of need, his dictator buddy sends a boat full of ballots halfway across

02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:14.640
the world to screw him over.

02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:18.160
That seems like an indication that Trump's deal making skills are what the cracked up

02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:19.160
to be.

02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:21.080
I mean this sincerely, Jordan.

02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:25.000
This is the most amazingly stupid theory that I think I've ever heard someone suggest on

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Infowars.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:29.240
I've never heard anything like this in my entire life.

02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:33.480
There have been dumber theories, I think, but this is something that Roger is suggesting

02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:37.160
as being supported by, quote, absolute incontrovertible.

02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:45.220
I am more likely to believe the earth is flat than that North Korea could successfully secretly

02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:49.760
get boats to Maine, period.

02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:50.760
Full of ballots.

02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:51.760
No, I don't.

02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:56.800
I mean, even like a dinghy, a dinghy with North Korea printed on the side of it couldn't

02:14:56.800 --> 02:14:59.320
get to Maine from North Korea.

02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:00.400
That is insane.

02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:06.480
If North Koreans could get, like if the state of North Korea could get boats full of ballots

02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:10.680
to Maine, why are we worried about their rocket program?

02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:16.760
Like they could just bring a bomb.

02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:22.120
North Koreans just fucking lift a bomb into Maine and then walk away and get on their

02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:25.840
boats and click a button and like, haha, we've defeated you Americans.

02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:32.040
I feel like Roger's acting like the surveillance on North Korea is just like a guy asleep.

02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:33.040
It must be.

02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:34.040
It must be.

02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:35.040
Just in front of a bunch of monitors.

02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:36.040
No, no, no.

02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:39.880
They put a picture of the room that they were supposed to be monitoring in the camera so

02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:41.800
it looks like that the...

02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:42.800
But it's not.

02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:44.840
It's a picture on top of the camera.

02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:48.780
I'm baffled by this, but I do think that this is the kind of thing you can get someone to

02:15:48.780 --> 02:15:51.280
say whenever you get them out of prison.

02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:52.280
Yep.

02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:54.000
This is the kind of...

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Yeah, sure.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:56.280
You can do whatever the fuck you want, man.

02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:00.080
Yeah, hey man, you were destined to be here by God and North Korean boats are the only

02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:01.240
reason you lost the election.

02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:03.120
They showed up in Maine and fucked you over.

02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:08.000
Hey buddy, I got takeout last night instead of being in jail, so guess what?

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:09.440
North Korea did it to Maine.

02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:10.440
Don't care.

02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:11.440
Moving on.

02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:15.400
It's awesome too because someone had to have made this up and that means that someone made

02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:18.360
up a story with the stupidest stake.

02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:22.360
There can't possibly be something else that this is based on.

02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:24.040
I don't know.

02:16:24.040 --> 02:16:29.920
Sell me on a thoroughly controvertible document.

02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:34.520
I tried to look for some indication of what the fuck Roger was talking about and any story

02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:38.120
that I could find had to do with Roger saying this.

02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:39.120
So I don't know.

02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:40.120
Okay.

02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:41.120
I don't know.

02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:42.520
Maybe it's some deep thing on Twitter I couldn't find.

02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:43.520
That's a big swing.

02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:48.000
I wouldn't be surprised if this was another QAnon thing, quite frankly, but just like

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:49.000
god damn.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Roger, buddy.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Say it out loud.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Buddy, Roger.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:57.440
Put a globe in front of you and then just don't give me any documents.

02:16:57.440 --> 02:17:00.920
Put a globe on your desk and just point to how they got there.

02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:01.920
Show me how they both got there.

02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:02.920
Just with your finger.

02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:03.920
Did it go north?

02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:04.920
I'm not asking for details.

02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:05.920
Did it go north?

02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:06.920
Did it go above China and Russia?

02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:07.920
Do your best.

02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:08.920
Do your best.

02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:09.920
Through the arctic?

02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:10.920
Yeah, I don't care.

02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:11.920
Did it go up there?

02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:13.320
There are actual shipping lanes.

02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:14.320
Just do your best.

02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:16.680
Did it go down?

02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:19.080
Maybe try to get through the Straits of Gibraltar?

02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:22.800
Maybe try to get into the Mediterranean and then go through there?

02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:24.240
Very serious question.

02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:26.280
Did it go through the earth?

02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:31.800
I think that the only state it would be more difficult to get a boat to is Kansas.

02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:34.600
Because it's in the middle of the fucking country.

02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:39.600
Because it would take a huge wave to get in there.

02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:40.600
Really have to get up there.

02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:43.720
It's a fucking black rock or some shit.

02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:45.880
Fitzcarraldo is easier to say.

02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:46.880
Yes, exactly.

02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:49.720
It's a better reference than my lost reference.

02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:51.400
So that's silly.

02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:52.400
And Roger is dumb.

02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:53.400
Very silly.

02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:57.280
But this next clip of Roger is like, hey man, you've forgotten the script.

02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:00.760
I have a very high regard for Sidney Powell.

02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:06.400
I have an equally high regard for my old friend, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who I've had a friendship

02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:11.240
with since his first campaign for mayor of New York City.

02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:13.600
Hey guy, didn't Rudy cover up 9-11?

02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:15.280
No, no, no, no.

02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:18.040
Forgiven, passing on, moving on.

02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:19.040
Don't worry about it.

02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:23.800
So Roger also thinks that Trump supporters need to get aggressive and they need to force

02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:28.500
legislatures to just say, hey, Trump's cool, let him stay president.

02:18:28.500 --> 02:18:31.480
And then we get a very familiar phenomenon.

02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:37.320
And I think supporters of the president in the key states need to begin now contacting

02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:39.360
your Republican state legislators.

02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:43.920
Those are your Republican state senators or your state representatives.

02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:50.280
Some states, they call them assemblies and urge them to support the president, to support

02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:56.500
an objective and honest count of the election and the certification of electors that will

02:18:56.500 --> 02:19:00.880
support Donald Trump at the electoral college.

02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:03.360
The Stonewalling, there's no evidence, is ridiculous.

02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:04.880
Yeah, it sure is.

02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:06.880
How's that sandwich?

02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:10.280
Stonewalling is strong.

02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:11.280
So Alex-

02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:13.320
Do more of the German guy again.

02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:18.420
Alex bids farewell to Roger and he doesn't add, and he talks about how he has a promo

02:19:18.420 --> 02:19:19.420
code.

02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:24.480
You put Patriot on the website, you get 10% more off, and he's like, I never do promo

02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:25.480
codes.

02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:29.000
And I started to think about it like, I don't think I have heard him do a promo code.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Well, that's a good question.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.520
Because I think I would have made fun of it.

02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:32.520
I think so.

02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:35.000
I think I would have made fun of whatever word he chose to be the promo code.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.240
I think we would have gotten there sooner or later, yeah.

02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:38.240
Yeah.

02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:39.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:40.960
I don't feel like he does do promo codes very often.

02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:43.080
I can't think of a time where we've made fun of him.

02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:44.080
That's interesting.

02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:46.720
I don't know what that means, but he then gets into talking about how you need-

02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:48.560
It means you get an extra 10% off, buddy.

02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:49.560
I'm not buying shit.

02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:50.560
Oh, okay.

02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:51.560
You need fish oil.

02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:52.560
Yes, you do.

02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:53.560
And so do your kids.

02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:54.560
Sure, they do.

02:19:54.560 --> 02:19:55.560
Wait, can they choose to take fish oil?

02:19:55.560 --> 02:19:56.560
Promo code Patriot, emplorestore.com.

02:19:56.560 --> 02:19:58.560
Just want to remind you, you're the reason we're on air.

02:19:58.560 --> 02:19:59.560
Thank you.

02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:03.040
These are great products you and your family need, especially for children, man.

02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:04.640
This fish oil is so good for children.

02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:05.640
So good for everybody.

02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:08.440
But man, I tell you what it does for their brains.

02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:11.200
It's what your brain literally runs on.

02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:13.640
It's like the perfect thing compared to like sugar.

02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:15.120
Sugar's horrible for your brain.

02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:18.280
This is what it actually runs on, but I'm digressing.

02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:19.280
Yeah.

02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:22.320
I don't know if it's like fish oil or sugar.

02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:23.800
I don't know if those are the-

02:20:23.800 --> 02:20:25.440
It's fish oil or sugar.

02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:26.440
It is not glucose.

02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:31.520
It is not Omega-3s or whatever you would like.

02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:34.760
It is either a big bowl of fish oil-

02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:37.200
I can't imagine a conversation between parents.

02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:39.440
One of them's Alex and he's like, yeah, you should give your kids fish oil.

02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:41.960
And the other parent's like, no, we're going with sugar.

02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:46.280
I give them sugar pills every morning, about twice a day.

02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:48.200
Just concentrated stuff though.

02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:56.080
So at this point in the episode, Alex realizes that Lynn Wood, the attorney, is doing the

02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:57.080
press conference.

02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:58.080
Yes.

02:20:58.080 --> 02:20:59.080
Bat shit.

02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:00.080
Quite.

02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:01.080
Yeah.

02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:02.080
Yeah.

02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:03.080
Absolute wild bat shit.

02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:04.080
And so Alex goes to it live and I was like, holy shit.

02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:05.080
I love it.

02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:12.400
1776, we'll commence again.

02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:15.240
We're going to send that message.

02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:19.000
We're going to send that message to George Soros.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:23.160
Get out of our country George Soros.

02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:25.520
He's not here.

02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:26.920
Oh shit.

02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:29.200
This is so scary.

02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:31.600
I mean, we're laughing, but that's fucking terrifying.

02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:32.600
No, no, no.

02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:33.600
Yeah.

02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:37.400
That's fucking, yeah, that is a Hitler rally.

02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:38.920
That's not a non Hitler rally.

02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:44.240
That is a Hitler rally where Hitler would Hitler, get out of our country.

02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:45.240
Hitler rally.

02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:46.240
Hitler.

02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:47.240
Poor Hitler.

02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:49.800
That is five Hitler mustaches, Dan.

02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:50.800
On a scale of one to five.

02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:51.880
On a scale of one to five mustaches.

02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:54.440
I think it's four just because you got to leave some room.

02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:55.440
That's true.

02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:56.800
There's more Hitler to be done.

02:21:56.800 --> 02:21:57.800
Yeah.

02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:03.560
So Lynn Wood gets around to talking about, hey, hey, look, the media.

02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:04.560
Bad.

02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:05.560
Sure.

02:22:05.560 --> 02:22:07.120
There's there are places that are good though.

02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:08.760
Oh, well, that's good to know.

02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:09.760
Yeah.

02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:12.040
Especially because this is being broadcast live on info wars.

02:22:12.040 --> 02:22:13.040
Yes.

02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:15.240
Now everybody's been reading the media.

02:22:15.240 --> 02:22:16.240
Stop.

02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:17.240
It's a lie.

02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:19.040
It's a lie.

02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:20.280
You can't trust them.

02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:22.280
Stick with OAN and Newsmax.

02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:25.920
They tell you the truth.

02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:26.920
Read the Epoch Times.

02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:28.920
They tell you the truth.

02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:30.560
We'll never say I'm bored.

02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:32.920
This is a battle between good and evil.

02:22:32.920 --> 02:22:36.080
They'll never say info wars were too powerful.

02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:38.360
That is sad.

02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:40.400
That is sad.

02:22:40.400 --> 02:22:42.160
That is so sad.

02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:47.480
Even fucking crazy people with nothing to lose are no better than to associate themselves

02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:48.480
with that.

02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:49.480
So sad.

02:22:49.480 --> 02:22:53.640
The dude would have no problem saying info wars if he actually thought they were worth

02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:54.640
a damn.

02:22:54.640 --> 02:22:55.640
Yep.

02:22:55.640 --> 02:22:56.640
Oh my God.

02:22:56.640 --> 02:22:57.640
Yep.

02:22:57.640 --> 02:23:00.600
If they thought info wars was going to grow, they would say info wars immediately.

02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:04.560
You know what's a better propagandist right now?

02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:05.560
Coat rack.

02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:06.560
Yeah.

02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:07.560
Just a random person.

02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:08.560
Yep.

02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:11.840
A random face that is shaved and in a suit is better than Alex.

02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:17.800
This coat rack has done a great job of being there, not talking, which is better than Alex

02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:18.800
Jones.

02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:19.800
Yeah.

02:23:19.800 --> 02:23:22.480
A random person who doesn't have the intense baggage that Alex has.

02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:23.680
Oh, let's see.

02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:28.000
Someone who doesn't have to fucking pretend that the president's son told him to investigate

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:29.000
something.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.960
Someone who's not an embarrassing sack.

02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:31.960
Yeah.

02:23:31.960 --> 02:23:35.120
Um, anyway, uh, Alex is like, yeah, we'll go back to it.

02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:36.120
We'll go back to this.

02:23:36.120 --> 02:23:37.120
We'll jump back and forth.

02:23:37.120 --> 02:23:38.120
I got to take some calls.

02:23:38.120 --> 02:23:39.840
I'll take some calls.

02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:44.640
So this, uh, this caller, he decides that, uh, war is coming.

02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:50.880
But like Dr. P says, Dr. Prochnik is the art of war and God has drawn out the enemy.

02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:55.240
Now they are completely exposed, completely uncovered, and there's nothing that they can

02:23:55.240 --> 02:23:56.240
do.

02:23:56.240 --> 02:23:57.700
And Trump doesn't have to do another thing.

02:23:57.700 --> 02:24:01.640
We, the people will do the rest, like Glenwood or like Glenwood just said.

02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:08.040
And so I would say this, the declaration of war date is January 11th, 2021, according

02:24:08.040 --> 02:24:14.000
to the executive order that was revived September 12th, 2020 Trump knows what's up, but do we

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:15.000
know what's up?

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Are we ready?

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.160
Are we the people ready to take this country back from the globalist that have controlled

02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:21.160
it since the 18.

02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:25.780
So you're saying he's not up there commanding the forces that he wants it to be organic.

02:24:25.780 --> 02:24:26.780
He's leaving it in our hands.

02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:27.780
I hear you.

02:24:27.780 --> 02:24:28.780
I think that's what he's doing.

02:24:28.780 --> 02:24:29.780
Yeah.

02:24:29.780 --> 02:24:34.720
Well, we better hit the streets and like Linwood's doing it, like we're doing, trying to find

02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:36.920
meaning in your lack of leadership.

02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:37.920
Yep.

02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:38.920
Yep.

02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:40.720
He wants us to be a revolution.

02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:41.720
Violent.

02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:42.720
Wow.

02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:45.120
So, uh, Rogan is everybody always want to fight a war.

02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:46.320
It's 2020.

02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:47.720
We can't outsmart these idiots.

02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:49.000
What are we doing?

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Fighting a war.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:51.000
What are you doing?

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:52.240
Fighting a war.

02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:55.240
Look, humans are not 50 years old.

02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:57.960
Look, the issue is that Rogan's coming up tomorrow.

02:24:57.960 --> 02:24:58.960
Sure.

02:24:58.960 --> 02:24:59.960
Now it's promotes that.

02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:06.040
And then the show takes the leftist of left turns, rightist of right turns as I'm not

02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:07.040
positive.

02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:09.080
It's just a crazy turn out of left field.

02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:11.200
Joe Rogan is on the show tomorrow.

02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:12.200
Yep.

02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:14.320
Right here in studio.

02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:15.320
So look for that.

02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:20.680
And a lot of other surprises.

02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:24.400
You know, I've known Steve Pacinik for, I'm sorry, what?

02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:30.620
And I knew he was in the CFR and I knew that, uh, he did run the overthrow of multiple governments.

02:25:30.620 --> 02:25:35.480
That's in the congressional record and a lot of other things.

02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:40.640
And pretty much everything you ever told me turned out to be very accurate.

02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:46.420
But I just, I believe he was told by high level folks in the CIA that Trump's done this

02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:49.200
thing and they're all going to the global struggle.

02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:53.720
I just wonder if they're feeding him a lot of bull because man, I mean, you saw what

02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:55.280
Barr came out and did and everything else.

02:25:55.280 --> 02:26:00.000
I just, I'm not up here saying we're out of the woods and I, and I'm not up here saying

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:01.200
that I'm not disagreeing with him.

02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:05.560
I'm not saying I think he's a disingenuous person or a liar.

02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:07.640
I just, you know, I have a bad feeling.

02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:08.640
Yeah.

02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:09.640
Yeah.

02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:14.040
So Alex is, uh, is, uh, this is, this is weird because he did say that Steve was still working

02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:19.200
for the CIA after the Las Vegas shooting when Steve tried to convince him that no one died

02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:20.200
and it was all fake.

02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:25.560
Um, so now, uh, he's trying to retain Steve's credibility, but just, he's been fooled by

02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:27.540
high level CIA people.

02:26:27.540 --> 02:26:31.520
He's trying to, he's trying to have his cake and eat it too here and it's just not good.

02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:33.460
You gotta cut ties or you gotta lean in.

02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:36.120
You can't half ass with, uh, Stevie P's.

02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:39.380
But I do, I do kind of feel like, yeah, good call.

02:26:39.380 --> 02:26:40.380
Good call.

02:26:40.380 --> 02:26:42.980
Like knowing at least that you can't agree with him.

02:26:42.980 --> 02:26:45.320
This one might be too, this one might be too much even for, even for us.

02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:48.560
Well, because it's, again, David Knight just texted me mean language.

02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:51.680
But it's also like what we talked about on the first time this came up.

02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:57.560
It's too falsifiable when this never comes up, uh, up, it's like, Oh, what happened?

02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:00.200
I thought the election was a fucking sting operation.

02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:01.600
All the proof should be there.

02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:02.600
Where is it?

02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:03.600
Yeah.

02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:05.240
It's, it's a disappointing game.

02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:11.880
But look, Steve might be wrong because people might be lying to us.

02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:12.880
True.

02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:13.880
But there's one thing that's totally true.

02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:14.880
What's that?

02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:19.680
I mean, he wasn't joking, um, when he said China called him a pachinik has sent me video

02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:23.360
and photos when he's in North Korea, hanging out with the North Koreans.

02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:27.680
I mean, he gets around folks and so I'll just leave it at that.

02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:34.480
He took a boat, uh, but, uh, from Florida to North Korea, he says Beijing, you know,

02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:38.440
high level operatives called him and they're like, yeah, I know.

02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:39.880
We know Trump's going to win.

02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:44.860
You notice Putin won't congratulate Biden, man.

02:27:44.860 --> 02:27:46.240
This is really sad.

02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:47.240
Yeah.

02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:51.360
Steve, Steve is like, Oh, well, man, you know, maybe, maybe he's wrong about all this, but

02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:53.880
China did call him because I've been courted.

02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:54.880
Shut up.

02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:58.480
You can't even get it up for Steve pajana getting a call from China.

02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:00.560
No, I've seen him.

02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:01.880
He was in North Korea one time.

02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:04.600
Hey, it's funny that you bring up, uh, getting it up.

02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:06.200
I can't take super volatility.

02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:07.880
I obviously don't need it.

02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:12.200
Uh, but I mean, I don't want to get graphic as a family show, but I don't need to be walking

02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:16.520
around with, you know, something going on downstairs.

02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:17.520
Okay.

02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:21.320
I mean, I, I mean, I take it, I mean, it's ridiculous.

02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:28.280
It's like waking up at 4 0 AM or 5 0 AM, you know, you've, you've got a, an erection.

02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:32.400
Is super male vitality actually just like straight up bull hormones?

02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:34.440
What the fuck is it?

02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:37.320
Every time we hear about it, it's like, Oh yeah, yeah.

02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:39.160
His wife walks bow legged.

02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:41.040
So buy this fucking boner.

02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:42.040
I love it.

02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:45.160
I've never heard, I've never heard that moment happen.

02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:49.680
That moment of Alex being forced to say the word erection.

02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:51.580
That is so awful.

02:28:51.580 --> 02:28:52.840
It really was gross.

02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:53.840
It really was gross.

02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:56.760
I have cursed all of you with that.

02:28:56.760 --> 02:28:58.640
I was trying not to focus on it.

02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:04.080
So Alex goes back to calls and uh, he's, he's sitting here and he's like, he's having a

02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:07.880
good time with this caller because this caller is speculating that, Hey man, these globalists

02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:12.600
they're so out of control, they'll probably let China grounded invade us.

02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:13.600
Sure.

02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:14.600
Right.

02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:15.600
That's probably what they're going to do in boats.

02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:20.040
And because Alex was so excited about this, he accidentally let this guy keep talking.

02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:24.920
These go, there's a man who's so corrupt, they so dangerous that they don't, I think

02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:25.920
they're going to let China invade.

02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:29.120
I can just say, they want to break this.

02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:33.040
They are foaming at the mouth to kill us because it's a spiritual thing.

02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:34.040
I agree.

02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:35.040
Tell me what your gut tells you.

02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:38.760
Oh man, it's going to fall like Ukraine and go by to get in.

02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:44.160
He's going to go against the American Patriots, the white people of the country that he hates.

02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:45.160
They hate us.

02:29:45.160 --> 02:29:48.400
That's why they robbed the whole, uh, belt, uh, with the votes.

02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:52.760
All the white people right there voted Trump is we've seen it that night, but he's going

02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:58.520
to cause war against the white Patriots soon as he get in office and then maybe I think

02:29:58.520 --> 02:30:01.560
no, I agree to try to trick white people to attack black people.

02:30:01.560 --> 02:30:06.960
No, it ain't about black and white because I'm saying they're trying to trick us to kill

02:30:06.960 --> 02:30:07.960
each other though.

02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:11.640
Yeah, but black people won't, they know what's going on.

02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:15.680
But uh, these people that sent top, they don't like their own color, man.

02:30:15.680 --> 02:30:17.080
They want to kill y'all.

02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:18.080
Oh boy.

02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:21.840
Alex, you should have pretended he hung up.

02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:26.480
I am not comfortable in this conversation.

02:30:26.480 --> 02:30:32.480
This caller who I've had a great time talking to has now revealed that he believes that

02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:34.640
the Patriots are the white people.

02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:37.080
It's very clear.

02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:44.200
Uh, I um, it is fun where he's, he's like, no, no, I'm doing a good job.

02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:45.920
I'm saying what you're saying.

02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:47.080
All the Patriots are the white people.

02:30:47.080 --> 02:30:49.400
And he's like, no, no, you're not supposed to actually say that.

02:30:49.400 --> 02:30:52.560
And so Alex tries to save it by being like, yeah, they're trying to get the white people

02:30:52.560 --> 02:30:53.920
to foolishly attack the black people.

02:30:53.920 --> 02:30:54.920
No, no, no, no.

02:30:54.920 --> 02:30:55.920
Black people are fine.

02:30:55.920 --> 02:30:59.320
It's not about white people.

02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:04.880
So Alex gets, uh, gets back from commercial break and I will say that, uh, you belong

02:31:04.880 --> 02:31:05.880
to the city.

02:31:05.880 --> 02:31:10.120
Did play once during this episode and Alex didn't get enthusiastic about it.

02:31:10.120 --> 02:31:15.400
However, Gnarls Barkley, uh, the song crazy sure plays and Alex does get a little excited

02:31:15.400 --> 02:31:16.400
for this.

02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:17.400
It is not the destination.

02:31:17.400 --> 02:31:18.400
It is the journey.

02:31:18.400 --> 02:31:19.400
It's a test, my friends.

02:31:19.400 --> 02:31:20.400
And it's real.

02:31:20.400 --> 02:31:36.040
It's my only advice, Jeff sucker, look at you, you think you're in control?

02:31:36.040 --> 02:31:37.040
Don't do it.

02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:38.040
Don't do it.

02:31:38.040 --> 02:32:06.640
You might've noticed that the song skip there and that's good as Alex said, you guys are

02:32:06.640 --> 02:32:11.080
in control of the bleep button at the wrong time.

02:32:11.080 --> 02:32:16.480
So the shit went out over the air and a little cut, skip the part where he says, drop that.

02:32:16.480 --> 02:32:17.480
Yep.

02:32:17.480 --> 02:32:18.480
Yeah.

02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:19.480
You got really into it.

02:32:19.480 --> 02:32:24.840
I do like him that that's probably the most unhinged I've heard anyone sound in a good

02:32:24.840 --> 02:32:25.920
long while.

02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:27.840
That was, that was out there.

02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:28.840
Yeah.

02:32:28.840 --> 02:32:33.320
So Alex, uh, you know, he's into predictive programming and loves, uh, when it loves people

02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:35.520
to say that movies are reality.

02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:36.760
This is a new one for me.

02:32:36.760 --> 02:32:39.040
Hey, Hey Alex, two things here.

02:32:39.040 --> 02:32:43.200
Number one, if you remember a movie that came out in 2006, man of the year, Robin Williams,

02:32:43.200 --> 02:32:48.160
they had an election, the voting machines switched the election and switched your results

02:32:48.160 --> 02:32:51.880
to the candidate that was less desirable, just like what's happening right now.

02:32:51.880 --> 02:32:53.160
That's right.

02:32:53.160 --> 02:32:54.160
That's a good movie.

02:32:54.160 --> 02:32:56.160
It's set in Latin America.

02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:57.400
Correct.

02:32:57.400 --> 02:32:58.400
Good conversation.

02:32:58.400 --> 02:33:03.200
Hey, there's this movie that it's real.

02:33:03.200 --> 02:33:09.860
These people just cannot believe for one second that the guy for the past four years, they

02:33:09.860 --> 02:33:16.920
have heard nothing but horrible shit about from one huge section of the country.

02:33:16.920 --> 02:33:20.200
They can't believe that that guy might not be beloved.

02:33:20.200 --> 02:33:22.800
Well, no, because they haven't heard that.

02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:29.120
It's all the mainstream media that's creating this false perception that no one likes Trump.

02:33:29.120 --> 02:33:30.120
Okay.

02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:31.120
That's fine.

02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:35.120
Yeah, I mean, I guess that everybody in this world lives in their own bubble where they

02:33:35.120 --> 02:33:40.580
don't have to deal with like reality at all, but I mean, you can't go out, you can't walk

02:33:40.580 --> 02:33:43.640
down the street and not be like, Oh, a lot of people hate Trump.

02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:48.440
Well, it's, it's kind of, you know, it's an interesting line that I struggle with sometimes

02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:53.320
or at least I have in the past and that is that like, you can recognize that organizations

02:33:53.320 --> 02:33:58.480
like the Koch brothers and stuff, they do fund things massively on the right, astroturf

02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:00.180
stuff.

02:34:00.180 --> 02:34:07.600
But knowing that you cannot say that people don't believe conservative principles or values

02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:10.000
or have right leaning politics.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:14.500
You can't say that all that's fake because there is this libertarian monied interest

02:34:14.500 --> 02:34:19.360
that's floating in and trying to push things that way.

02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:25.280
This same is sort of the trap that Alex and a lot of the Trump folk fall into, which is

02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:29.980
like they think that the media is just telling everyone that Trump is bad.

02:34:29.980 --> 02:34:35.340
And then they're sort of thinking that no one actually believes that the media is crumbling

02:34:35.340 --> 02:34:40.280
and it's powerless and it's pathetic and everyone knows they're liars now.

02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:41.280
Yeah.

02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:45.320
But yeah, so that's kind of the trap that they're in.

02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:46.320
Yeah.

02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:52.960
I mean, I guess when you, I suppose if you dehumanize enough people or a large enough

02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:59.160
group, then eventually people who know who are like, Oh no, I know plenty of people who

02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:01.640
would normally fall into that group.

02:35:01.640 --> 02:35:06.520
They must secretly be Trump supporters too or something because it's like, how can I,

02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:07.520
I don't know.

02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:08.520
I don't know.

02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:09.520
These, this is nuts.

02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:10.520
Yeah.

02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:11.520
Wild.

02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:16.280
So this caller believes that Biden, if he gets in, Kamala Harris will become president.

02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:17.920
Biden will get out of there somehow.

02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:18.920
Sure.

02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:21.760
And then he'll trip and fall and wear an ankle bracelet.

02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:28.240
And then Kamala Harris will make either AOC or Hillary, there we go, vice president.

02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:32.640
And then Alex asks the most introspective question I could imagine.

02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:33.640
All right.

02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:36.920
If Biden stays in within six months, he's going to have a stroke or he's going to be

02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:41.600
declared incompetent, which is going to move Kamala Harris into the president's spot.

02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:46.760
And she's going to either put either AOC or Hillary Clinton in as her vice president.

02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:47.760
Why?

02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:51.800
That it would be the absolute worst scenario for this country if that would happen.

02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:54.280
Why?

02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:55.800
Why is there such a cult of Hillary?

02:35:55.800 --> 02:35:59.920
Is this, is she such a devil worshiper like the demon that's able to inhabit her is like

02:35:59.920 --> 02:36:00.920
they worship her.

02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:01.920
Yeah.

02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:02.920
Yeah.

02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:06.560
Why is the left so obsessed with Hillary Clinton?

02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:07.560
Yes.

02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:11.960
Why are we the left obsessed, obsessed with him?

02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:16.160
We just can't stop talking about Hillary, Dan.

02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:17.160
Wow.

02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:18.160
Yeah.

02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:19.160
Yeah.

02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:20.160
Yeah.

02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:21.160
Yeah.

02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:22.160
Yeah.

02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:23.160
That's pretty, pretty cool.

02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:24.160
Pretty cool.

02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:27.200
I don't know if projection gets that loud.

02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:28.200
No.

02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:30.520
That's the most loud.

02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:34.920
So this, Alex gets another caller and this dude says that they're going to take over

02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:35.920
DC.

02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:36.920
Sure.

02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:37.920
Right?

02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:38.920
There's going to be a protest.

02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:39.920
Yeah.

02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:40.920
Millions.

02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:46.600
This is where I probably not going to do this, but now I do have the opportunity.

02:36:46.600 --> 02:36:50.080
I don't know if I could do it safely, but if Alex did this, I would want to go make

02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:51.240
a documentary about it.

02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:52.240
Okay.

02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:53.240
I really, really will.

02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:55.160
I already have the website ready to go.

02:36:55.160 --> 02:36:56.160
Take over DC.com.

02:36:56.160 --> 02:36:57.160
Love it.

02:36:57.160 --> 02:36:59.360
We're going to do with what you guys did.

02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:00.360
Love it.

02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:02.360
However, everybody needs to be out there.

02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:03.960
We need to set up supply lines.

02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:04.960
We need to camp.

02:37:04.960 --> 02:37:06.360
We need to take care of those.

02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:07.360
Come out there.

02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:08.360
No, I agree.

02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:09.360
In fact, I've already decided.

02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:10.360
I'm moving into DC.

02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:11.360
Yes.

02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:13.440
They let the homeless camp everywhere, but oh, watch, they'll say no.

02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:16.100
I'm moving in to the Lincoln Memorial.

02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:17.100
I'm moving in there.

02:37:17.100 --> 02:37:18.240
I'm going to live in DC.

02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:24.800
I would love to go and document Alex's time at the Lincoln Memorial squatting.

02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:32.920
No, if you are listening to this and you have $5, I don't know where I was going to end

02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:33.920
that.

02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:36.120
We need a billion dollars to make that documentary is what I'm saying.

02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:37.120
No, no, no, no, no.

02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:39.440
I don't want anybody to give money to make a documentary.

02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:41.800
No, I was going the way wrong way in my head.

02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:47.120
I just don't think I can do it because just logistics of the world.

02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:51.840
But I think that there's, there's such an amazing story to be told here if Alex were

02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:52.840
to go.

02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:58.620
And that is that he would realize that it's winter in DC and here we go home.

02:37:58.620 --> 02:37:59.620
Here we go.

02:37:59.620 --> 02:38:00.880
This is what I got for you.

02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:02.920
We got to get Ken Burns in on this.

02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:03.920
We got to get Ken Burns.

02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:05.560
We got to get Ken Burns.

02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:06.560
We got to get everybody.

02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:07.560
Yeah, totally.

02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:08.560
Bring back Ronson.

02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:09.560
Bring back Ronson.

02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:12.120
Uh, it gets, uh, Louis Thoreau.

02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:13.120
Get Hertzog.

02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:14.860
No, well, who better than Hertzog?

02:38:14.860 --> 02:38:17.840
This is Grizzly Man 2, the grizzliest.

02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:20.560
Alex eats Owen Shroyer.

02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:21.560
It's too cold in DC.

02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:24.480
It's too cold in DC!

02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:27.240
Or Owen Shroyer skins Alex and wears him like a blanket.

02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:31.760
Day two, Alex is trying to make a fire out of his femurs.

02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:34.080
Owen's trying to light a fire with Owen's feet.

02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:38.280
Now I heard that you can use whale fat, so maybe you can use Owen fat.

02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:42.240
Owen was warned spiritually when I said that I would eat my neighbors.

02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:44.120
So cosmically this is okay.

02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:45.120
It's cool.

02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:51.040
I think that there is such an amazing potential in my brain for, like, what this looks like

02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:52.040
in the real world.

02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:53.040
Alex isn't going to do this.

02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:54.040
No, obviously not.

02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:58.200
If he did this, he would stay at a hotel nearby and show up and yell in a bull horn every

02:38:58.200 --> 02:38:59.200
now and again.

02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:01.240
He would never stay.

02:39:01.240 --> 02:39:03.840
It's not going to be over 40 degrees until March.

02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:04.840
Nope, nope, nope.

02:39:04.840 --> 02:39:05.840
Not gonna happen.

02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:06.840
DC.

02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:07.840
Average temperatures.

02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:08.840
Low.

02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:09.840
It's cold.

02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:10.840
It's winter.

02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:12.840
He's not going to go out there and camp out at the Lincoln Memorial?

02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:14.720
He doesn't believe this shit.

02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:15.720
Nope.

02:39:15.720 --> 02:39:16.720
Nope.

02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:17.720
But I would love it.

02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:18.720
I would love it.

02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:19.720
I would...

02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:20.720
I...

02:39:20.720 --> 02:39:21.720
Man, I wish I was a millionaire.

02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:23.800
If I was a millionaire, here's what I would do.

02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:24.800
What would you do?

02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:26.960
I would say, Alex, giant donation.

02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:28.900
But you have to do this.

02:39:28.900 --> 02:39:31.000
You have to yourself.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:32.380
Not any of your staff.

02:39:32.380 --> 02:39:36.400
You have to stay out there as long as this encampment lasts.

02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:41.960
And much like maybe some MTV show from the early 2000s, you get paid more the longer

02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:42.960
you stay out there.

02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:43.960
I like it.

02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:44.960
And all on camera.

02:39:44.960 --> 02:39:45.960
Yeah.

02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:46.960
Because I want to see your misery.

02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:47.960
Yeah.

02:39:47.960 --> 02:39:53.000
I want to see you camping out fucking pissed off at three in the morning so mad that only

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.680
2,000 people showed up to your encampment.

02:39:55.680 --> 02:39:57.280
This needs to be fat bear.

02:39:57.280 --> 02:40:03.280
There needs to be 24-7 live streams of everybody like making wagers and shit.

02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:04.760
Like this should all be...

02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:07.900
This should be on Bet365 daily.

02:40:07.900 --> 02:40:09.440
This is what I'm talking about though.

02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:16.240
Like I probably would not go for the sake of safety and just responsibility in the present

02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:17.960
world we live in.

02:40:17.960 --> 02:40:22.500
Under ideal circumstances, I would love to go and make a documentary about this.

02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:28.880
The best I could do is if he actually does this and they actually have feeds, fuck, I

02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:32.880
might be tempted to do nonstop coverage of it.

02:40:32.880 --> 02:40:34.740
Like waiting for him to break.

02:40:34.740 --> 02:40:35.740
But he wouldn't break.

02:40:35.740 --> 02:40:37.460
It would be so disappointing.

02:40:37.460 --> 02:40:41.500
It would end up being like two minutes of Alex yelling in a bullhorn and then Harrison

02:40:41.500 --> 02:40:43.840
Smith in the studio or some shit.

02:40:43.840 --> 02:40:49.000
And there'd be an excuse for why he has to leave right away so he wouldn't lose all face.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Family stuff.

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:51.000
Yeah, totally.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Totally.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Yep.

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:54.000
All of a sudden COVID will be real.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:59.040
This is just another time, and it sucks because we've done this enough, that it's another

02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:04.640
time that I see this amazing potential in what could come and it's not going to.

02:41:04.640 --> 02:41:06.760
I'm preemptively disappointed in it.

02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:09.160
I know it's not going to be great.

02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:13.920
I remember it's the same thing I felt like the second time I heard there was a marathon.

02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:21.300
The first time, I thought like, oh my god, 12 hours, he's gonna be gassed by hour three.

02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:24.160
And then it's like, oh, hour three, David Knight's hosting.

02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:26.080
Oh no.

02:41:26.080 --> 02:41:28.480
And then the second time I'm like, it's not gonna be good.

02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:31.160
Now I'm just like a caravan fucked me.

02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:32.160
Everything just sucks.

02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:35.000
Alex going to Georgia sucked.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:40.720
I might have to write a song about Alex camping out in DC.

02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:42.000
Now here's the problem.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:49.960
When we make a show about an exhaustive failure who fails exhaustively all of the time, it's

02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:52.880
hard for us to expect him to succeed.

02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:54.720
But you kind of have to always...

02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:58.400
Yeah, you always hope Charlie Brown's going to kick that fucking ball, man.

02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:03.640
You have to come in with a little optimism or else, you know, it's a slog.

02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:07.880
Otherwise, then you'll never try and kick the ball again.

02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:11.560
So I beg you, Alex, please.

02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:12.560
Do it.

02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:13.560
Do it.

02:42:13.560 --> 02:42:14.560
Do it.

02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:15.560
You'll save America.

02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:17.560
We will create a documentary for free.

02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:22.200
You will save America single-handedly if you camp out at the Lincoln Memorial through the

02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:23.200
winter.

02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:25.760
And if you eat fish and try and get as fat as possible.

02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:26.760
Yeah.

02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:27.760
Come on.

02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:28.760
That's so good.

02:42:28.760 --> 02:42:29.760
Yeah.

02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:33.520
So we have one last clip here and it's a caller who's threatening to shut down Biden

02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:34.520
inauguration.

02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:35.520
Okay.

02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:36.520
Okay.

02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:38.320
He's going real deep right now.

02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:41.560
I see him doing something major before.

02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:44.960
I mean, he'll probably wait until their fake inauguration of Biden.

02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:48.760
It ain't going to be in DC because we're going to shut that down.

02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:51.440
They're probably going to do it in California or New York City.

02:42:51.440 --> 02:42:52.440
It's going to be something.

02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:56.120
Listen, I need everybody out there to understand me because I'm a major target.

02:42:56.120 --> 02:43:00.560
I'm not trying to act fancy pants, but let me tell you, I put my ass on the line, my

02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:01.560
skin of the game.

02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:02.560
Okay.

02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:03.560
I'm going to be there on the 12th.

02:43:03.560 --> 02:43:04.560
I want people there.

02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:06.520
And I'm going to be there on the 20th come hell or high water.

02:43:06.520 --> 02:43:10.160
So you got my commitment and they told me, don't you show your ass back in DC.

02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:11.160
Well, I'm coming.

02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:13.040
And so you go ahead and do whatever you want.

02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:14.760
Now that's what God wants.

02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:15.760
He strike me down.

02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:17.320
I'll become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:18.800
The quote Obi Wan Kenobi.

02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:20.120
You don't get to quote the Jedis.

02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:21.120
No, no, no.

02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:22.120
You're the bad guy.

02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:23.880
Remember your favorite guy is literally the emperor.

02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:24.880
Yeah.

02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:25.880
You don't get to do that.

02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:26.880
That's not fair.

02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:27.880
Jerk.

02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:33.560
See, now that would be, that would be acceptable on his, uh, I'm joining the dark side episode

02:43:33.560 --> 02:43:35.480
where he quotes Obi Wan the whole time.

02:43:35.480 --> 02:43:36.600
Yeah, that would make sense.

02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:43.660
And he comes into the show with just swelling strings out.

02:43:43.660 --> 02:43:44.660
That would be fitting.

02:43:44.660 --> 02:43:45.660
Yeah.

02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:46.660
That'd be great.

02:43:46.660 --> 02:43:48.720
So I don't think Alex is going to follow through with this.

02:43:48.720 --> 02:43:51.160
I think he's going to go do some publicity stunts in DC.

02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:55.840
He said he's going to be there on the 12th, which is when that rally he's going to co-opt

02:43:55.840 --> 02:43:56.840
is.

02:43:56.840 --> 02:43:57.840
Yeah.

02:43:57.840 --> 02:43:59.040
The 20th inauguration.

02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:02.880
I could see him going to that as well and trying to cause a scene.

02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:05.120
But when would the, when would the camping be?

02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:06.120
Would it be on the 12th?

02:44:06.120 --> 02:44:09.560
Would it start on the 12th and then go through the inauguration because that's what it should

02:44:09.560 --> 02:44:10.560
be.

02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:11.560
Set up a goddamn Zephyr.

02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:12.560
No chance.

02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:15.160
Get out there and broadcast from the Lincoln Memorial.

02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:20.680
He eats more sandwiches in a day than he will spend hours on that mall.

02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:21.680
This makes me sad.

02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:25.880
I want it to happen and I'm not going to allow myself to believe that it's not going to happen

02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:26.880
yet.

02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:27.880
There's a chance.

02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:28.880
Yes.

02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:29.880
There's always the chance.

02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:30.880
Hope springs eternal.

02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:35.080
It's still Schrodinger's occupation at this point, so we will see.

02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:36.800
Until we're allowed to observe it.

02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:37.800
Yeah.

02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:41.000
And another thing that's Schrodinger's, we have Schrodinger's Monday's episode.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Oh, that's true.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:43.000
It could be a Rogan episode.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:44.000
Could be.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:45.000
Could not be.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Could be.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:47.000
At this point, it is both.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:48.000
It is.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:52.480
It is simultaneously an episode about Rogan and not and you'll have to tune in on Monday

02:44:52.480 --> 02:44:53.480
to find out.

02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:55.760
That sounds like something I would hear on the Joe Rogan show.

02:44:55.760 --> 02:44:56.760
Head exploding.

02:44:56.760 --> 02:45:00.080
It is both at the same time.

02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:01.080
Yeah.

02:45:01.080 --> 02:45:04.320
Also, how about, I can't remember what his sponsors were.

02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:05.320
Damn it.

02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:07.480
Wasn't there a toilet one, Schwifty?

02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:09.040
No, that's Rick and Morty.

02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:10.040
I don't remember.

02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:11.040
Flushie.

02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:12.040
Flushie.

02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:13.040
No, Tushie.

02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:14.040
Who knows.

02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:16.440
Anyway, we'll be back, Jordan, but until then, we have a website.

02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:17.440
We do have a website.

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:18.440
It's knowledgefight.com.

02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:19.440
You bet.

02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:20.440
We're also on Twitter.

02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:21.440
We are on Twitter.

02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:23.120
It's at Knowledge Dungeon Door Fight and at Go To Bed Jordan.

02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:24.120
Yep.

02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:25.120
We're also on Facebook.

02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:27.760
We are on Facebook.

02:45:27.760 --> 02:45:31.080
If you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:32.080
doing God's work.

02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:33.080
Yep.

02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:34.080
We'll be back.

02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:35.080
But until then, I'm Neo.

02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:36.080
I'm Leo.

02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:37.080
I'm DZXClark.

02:45:37.080 --> 02:45:38.080
I'm Daryl Rundis.

02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:40.880
I'm a North Korean ballot tugboat captain.

02:45:40.880 --> 02:45:41.880
Andy in Kansas.

02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:42.880
You're on the air.

02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:43.880
Thanks for holding.

02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:44.880
Hello, Alex.

02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:45.880
I'm a first time caller.

02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:46.880
I'm a huge fan.

02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:47.880
I love your work.

02:45:47.880 --> 02:45:55.480
I love you.
