Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,760
I'm Jordan

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,520
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,680
beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,040
Oh indeed we are Dan

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,360
Jordan

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,360
Dan, quick question for ya

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,840
Sure, hit me

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,280
What's your bright spot this week?

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,880
My bright spot today is, so I've not taken part in too much

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,760
of like ordering food from places

32
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,560
Sure, sure, sure

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,600
I've tried to keep that limited because it's expensive and stuff

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,440
and I like to keep things kind of special

35
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:25,760
Right

36
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,400
But I realized that I hadn't had Taco Bell in a long time

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,200
and so I decided to order some Taco Bell delivery

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,960
Which is a nice thing

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,240
Reliving those comic days

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,440
I couldn't imagine that being something you could do

41
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,480
Well I ordered Taco Bell

42
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,680
Oh totally, totally

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,960
It's like pizzas delivered, Chinese foods delivered, and that is it

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,840
Yep, yep

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,680
Um, so that was kind of fun

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,280
But I noticed something on the menu that I had never seen before

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,920
It was like an aged cheddar chalupa

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,040
Okay

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,720
And so it was like a chalupa kind of thing, but it had like cheese

50
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,040
Yeah

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
Like as if, you know, it's like an Asiago cheese crust

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

53
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,840
I do always like it when the fast food all of a sudden is like

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,960
Ah, this is our artisan aged cheese

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,440
Very ambitious, very pretentious

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,760
Yeah

57
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,760
But I had to try it because, you know, you got to

58
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,200
And it was so good

59
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,320
It was also terrible

60
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,080
Yeah, of course, of course

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,480
I got it and was like, oh wow, this crunchiness of the cheese is really complimenting the

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,280
I'm like, what am I thinking?

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,960
What are you doing? What am I doing here?

64
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,080
It's fucking Taco Bell

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,120
Why am I fucking

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,200
Highfalutin' ass Taco Bell

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,280
Is this the Great British Baking Show? Come on now

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,840
Yeah, but I enjoyed it quite a bit and, you know, you got to find the light where it exists

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,120
Yeah, that's great, that's great

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,680
How about you?

71
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,560
Uh, I won't provide too many spoilers here, but Dan, as you might be aware

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,040
I'm a bit of a fan of Star Wars

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,200
Yes

74
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,240
Have you heard of Star Wars?

75
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,720
Yes I have

76
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,160
Okay, it's pretty good

77
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,600
That's the one with the Enterprise, right?

78
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the one with the Enterprise, the guys that have the uniforms, it's great

79
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,600
It's great

80
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,560
Ferengis

81
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, got little things on his head

82
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,840
There's that guy Q who's now ruining our world

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh no, is that where he came from?

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,400
I don't know

85
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,160
So yeah, Mandalorian, huge fan watching it

86
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,960
Baby Yoda

87
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,320
And yes, Baby Yoda

88
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,240
See, I can have conversations

89
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,120
He has a name now

90
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,520
Oh boy

91
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,640
Oh yeah, yeah, trouble

92
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
Should I try and guess it?

93
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,920
I think you should

94
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,080
Okay, Pete

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,240
No, really close though

96
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,200
Grogu

97
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,920
Grogu

98
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,960
Very close to Pete

99
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,760
Grogu?

100
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,000
Grogu, I know, it's Baby Yoda forever

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,040
That's a Star Wars name

102
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,680
Everyone agrees that it's Baby Yoda forever

103
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,240
Right, yeah

104
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:33,840
Grogu

105
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
But, again, no spoilers

106
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,560
Except for the name of Baby Yoda, that's a spoiler

107
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,720
No, that's not a spoiler, you find out, that was last episode

108
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,760
So that was a while back

109
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,520
Okay, it's a spoiler in case you're a week behind

110
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,600
Also, is it a spoiler to know Grogu is his name?

111
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,640
You immediately forget Grogu and you're like, that's Baby Yoda

112
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,120
Yeah, yeah

113
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,640
Yeah, no one cares

114
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,600
Not my Grogu

115
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,280
Hashtag

116
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:04,480
No, so this episode, most recent one, a character came back who made me extremely,

117
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,920
extremely happy in a very lovely way

118
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,200
The second season has been basically, like, do you remember Fun Dip?

119
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,040
I don't want to be like a dick in case it's right

120
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,560
Uh-huh, but my instinct is to joke that it's Jar Jar Binks

121
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,520
Ooh, no!

122
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:19,760
Okay

123
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,960
No, no, no

124
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,280
Okay

125
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,920
Beloved is...

126
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,880
He's a great character

127
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,920
No, uh, shit, where was I?

128
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
You just broke my conversation

129
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,080
Oh, yeah, the second season has been Fun Dip

130
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,480
You know, it's the sugar stick that you're dipping in more sugar to eat

131
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,720
Like, everything has been junk food and it has been incredible

132
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,680
and I love it so much

133
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,000
That metaphor falls apart because Fun Dip sucks

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
Yeah, Fun Dip does suck

135
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,040
I mean, it's a sugar overload is my point

136
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,000
But it's all just sugar

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
Even as a kid, I didn't want any Fun Dip

138
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,880
Oh, I loved Fun Dip

139
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,280
Come on, man

140
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,240
That stick was disgusting

141
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,640
I chewed on that stick like it was my friend

142
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,520
Like it was a milk bone and you were a stray dog

143
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,240
Exactly

144
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,760
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying that

145
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,400
It's delicious

146
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,440
I feel like my plan is, uh, watch The Mandalorian once there's, like, five seasons of it

147
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,200
And I can just watch it all

149
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,680
It's great

150
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,400
Yeah, I have this- I have that relationship with TV shows

151
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,440
Like, I want there to be multiple seasons of it that I can binge

152
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,000
Because if I like it, I don't want to stop watching it

153
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,480
Who was- I know Netflix was the first place to, like, just release the whole thing

154
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,600
Was it, like, Daredevil or something that was the first show where they're like

155
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,920
We're putting all 12 episodes out

156
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,160
And then I've never- I'm no longer able to watch episodic television

157
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,520
Yeah, I- it started earlier than that for me

158
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,080
Yeah

159
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,760
Or at least, like, the challenge of it

160
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,720
And I think it's because I- what I would do is I would come to shows late

161
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,400
Because I don't buy the hype and I don't want to get tricked by, like, people saying

162
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,920
This is the best thing ever

163
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,120
I like that's your relationship

164
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,760
Well, I don't want to get-

165
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,880
I don't want to get tricked by these liars who like stuff

166
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,640
A lot of television is reliant on cliffhanger-y nonsense

167
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,280
Sure, that's true

168
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,640
Especially hour-long dramas

169
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,200
Right, right, right

170
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
And so if you're watching it week to week

171
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,880
Like, the experience of that is so much more engrossing

172
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,920
And it can trick you into liking things that you don't actually like all that much

173
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,800
That's true

174
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,200
So I always try and give things a little bit of time

175
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,160
Give it a little space

176
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,720
Yeah, and so, like, Lost I started in, like, season four or something like that

177
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,560
And the experience of watching the prior three seasons, like, all in a row was pretty gratifying

178
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,280
Yeah, I think that happens to a lot of people with, like, The Wire

179
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,600
Where they're like, it takes three episodes to get into it

180
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,840
And I imagine if I started watching episodically

181
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,400
I'd watch the first episode and be like, eh, I'm good

182
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,800
Yeah

183
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,360
You know?

184
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't know if you'd say I'm good, but it would be a different experience

185
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah

186
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,440
It would be harder

187
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,920
But yeah, anyway

188
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,240
Television, models have changed

189
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,120
Yes, this is us, commentary, cultural, it's amazing

190
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,680
So, Jordan, today we've got an episode to go over

191
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,000
We're going to be talking about December 3rd and 4th, 2020

192
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,120
I'm Dan, this is 2020

193
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,520
Hey! 2020 is great forever now

194
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,020
Yay!

195
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,800
I started listening to the episode with Rogan

196
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,680
Alex's interview, a four-hour long interview with Joe Rogan

197
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,280
Riveting stuff they talked about

198
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,520
They were stoned in the first minute

199
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,440
Just policy, real questions getting into the nitty-gritty of universal basic income

200
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,160
I made it, like, 15 minutes in and I was like, I'll do an episode about this eventually, probably

201
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,880
But, like, it's so annoying

202
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,440
It's so...

203
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,520
To give you some context, like, Alex's first real question he asks is, like,

204
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,200
at what point did you realize that you were, like, really famous,

205
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,960
but you can do whatever you want to do?

206
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,640
That's a great question

207
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,880
And Rogan's answer is something along the lines of, like,

208
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,360
you know what I like about smoking weed is it makes me think about more interesting things

209
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,960
That is a fair point

210
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,280
Almost a way of, like, yeah, that's a dumb question

211
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,640
That's a fair point

212
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,160
That is a fair point on him

213
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,600
So I just, I didn't have it in me to do that for this episode

214
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,040
So we're talking about Thursday and Friday on the Alex Jones program

215
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,520
Alrighty

216
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,240
We're going to see if he's going to continue his ideas about moving to DC and living outside

217
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,200
I think it's a good idea

218
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,240
I think it's a good idea

219
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,600
Spoiler alert, no updates on that

220
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,480
No updates on that?

221
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,800
No

222
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,920
Did he even mention it?

223
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,320
Nope

224
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,520
I didn't think so

225
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,040
I'm thinking about it more than him

226
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,480
Yeah, that sounds right

227
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,840
So we'll get to business on this episode, but before we do we've got to take a little

228
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,320
moment to say thank you to some folks who've signed up and are supporting the show

229
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,600
That sounds like a great idea

230
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,240
Yeah, so first, great name, Dan from Colorado, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

231
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,280
I'm a policy wonk

232
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,000
Thanks, Dan

233
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,800
Thank you, Dan

234
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,560
Next, Kia I love you, you are now a policy wonk

235
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,760
I'm a policy wonk

236
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,960
Thank you, Kia, I love you

237
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,320
Wait, the cars?

238
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,720
Probably

239
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,680
Oh, okay

240
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,800
Next, Minnow the Cat and it's M-I-N-N-O-H, you are now a policy wonk

241
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,760
I'm a policy wonk

242
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,200
Thank you very much, Minnow the Cat

243
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,840
There you go

244
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:54,240
Next, Lang, J-L-A-N-G last initial J, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

245
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,280
I'm a policy wonk

246
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,720
Thank you very much, Lang

247
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,040
Thank you

248
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,680
Next, Patrick S, you are now a policy wonk

249
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,920
I'm a Policy Wonk!

250
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,680
Thank You Patrick!

251
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,400
There you go!

252
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,040
Next. EwingKing. Thank you so much.

253
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,300
You are now a Policy Wonk!

254
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,420
I'm a Policy Wonk!

255
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,700
Thank you very much EwingKing!

256
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,440
Like Patrick Ewingking

257
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,860
Yeah there's only one king, and that's Patrick Ewing

258
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,500
Patrick Ewing?

259
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah

260
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,500
Yep

261
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,440
Next. Kacmek and it's spelled K-H-A-S-M-E-K

262
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,420
Thank you so much!

263
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,680
You are now a Policy Wonk!

264
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,500
I'm a Policy Wonk!

265
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,100
Thank you very much!

266
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,020
Next. Biohazard. And finally... Biohazard.

267
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,000
Thank you so much! You are now a Policy Wonk!

268
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,980
I'm a Policy Wonk!

269
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,660
Thank you very much! Biohazard!

270
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,920
There you go! If you're out there listening you're thinkin'

271
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,000
you're thinking, hey, I enjoyed the show,

272
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,840
I'd like to support these gents.

273
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,000
You can do that by going to our website,

274
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,400
knowledgefight.com, clicking the button

275
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,520
that says support the show, or.

276
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,560
What you could do is you could take

277
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,080
that feeling of generosity, you can put it

278
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,640
into the rocket launcher that you have affixed

279
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,160
to your back, directly on top of your rocket pack,

280
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,000
of course. Sure.

281
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,320
You can bend down just a little bit

282
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,200
because a rocket launcher affixed to your back

283
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,680
is a terrible idea.

284
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,640
Pull your scope up and you fire that rocket launcher

285
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,360
into the imperial cruise ship of whatever charity

286
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,800
that you are looking for.

287
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,640
I think that one makes sense.

288
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,000
Was that a spoiler?

289
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,200
No, it was not.

290
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,400
Okay, good.

291
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,440
All right.

292
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,840
So Jordan, today, December 3rd, not a great episode.

293
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,520
December 4th, there's a little bit more going on,

294
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,800
but I did find a delightful out of context drop,

295
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,440
which I will share with you right now.

296
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,640
Jennifer Fleck, you're a constitutional lawyer, a patriot.

297
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,520
There's Admiral Atbar from Turn of the Jedi.

298
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,880
Hey, Star Wars.

299
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,320
See, it all makes sense now.

300
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,160
You love Star Wars.

301
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,000
It's all coming back.

302
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,040
It's a trap.

303
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,520
I love the idea that Alex is like,

304
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,840
you're a great constitutional lawyer.

305
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,680
Hey, there's Admiral Atbar.

306
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,240
Hey, there's Admiral Atbar over there.

307
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,480
It's like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade

308
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,120
has a constitutional lawyer float.

309
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,120
Weirdly, I think that perfectly sums up Alex's show.

310
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,760
It does kind of.

311
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,240
Talking to some nonsense person

312
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,800
he's calling a constitutional lawyer

313
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
getting distracted by Admiral Atbar.

314
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,640
Yeah.

315
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,480
Ah.

316
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,800
And how dare he maintain that he's not that into Star Wars.

317
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,160
You son of a bitch.

318
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,040
Yeah, so we start on the third here,

319
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,920
and I kind of maybe glanced this off

320
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,040
the first time I heard Alex discussing it

321
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,160
or bringing up this little factoid,

322
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,120
but I decided this time it would be best to look into it

323
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,440
and discuss what was going on.

324
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Oh my gosh, now 2,777 people died yesterday.

325
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,800
They're saying from COVID or COVID related things,

326
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,160
which means you give them a test

327
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:35,320
that the German courts have now ruled are 96% false positive.

328
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,880
So we heard him say that on a previous episode,

329
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,400
but I think it was in the context of something

330
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,000
that there were bigger things going on.

331
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,400
Yeah, it was part of a list of bullshit.

332
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,840
But now the German courts must be brought into this.

333
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,280
All right, let's see what happens.

334
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,240
So this story is a little bit more complicated

335
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,520
than what Alex is saying.

336
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,200
That's a shock.

337
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,920
What's at the core of it is what a German court determined

338
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,520
was that four German citizens who

339
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,800
were in Portugal on holiday were held illegally

340
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,680
when they were quarantined after one tested positive for COVID-19.

341
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't think Portugal cares.

342
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,640
Except it wasn't a German court, it was a Portuguese court.

343
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,600
See, now I think Portugal cares.

344
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,480
Yes.

345
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,400
One of these vacationers tested positive

346
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,280
and was in close contact with the other three,

347
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,160
so the Portuguese authorities quarantined them in a hotel.

348
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,360
They contested this decision, and ultimately judges

349
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,760
found that their quarantine was unlawful.

350
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,800
Part of the evidence that was used at their trial

351
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,320
was related to a study that claimed

352
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,880
that PCR tests were up to 97% unreliable

353
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,920
and caused that ratio of false positives.

354
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,760
However, as is always the case, that

355
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,000
is not what the study said.

356
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,640
This was a piece in the Clinical Infectious Diseases Journal,

357
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,480
which looked at what is known as the cycle threshold of testing

358
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,560
and how that could be a way to better understand

359
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,720
viral load and the possibility of infectiousness.

360
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,480
According to this article, the consensus

361
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,800
had previously been to understand someone is not

362
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,120
contagious after 10 days and a viral load that could not

363
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,960
be identified with a cycle threshold value of 30

364
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,200
or higher.

365
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,240
From 13,161 positive samples, 1,941

366
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,880
were chosen and tested using different cycle thresholds

367
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,400
to see how the early estimates held up

368
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,560
in those early assessments.

369
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,080
Yeah, quality control.

370
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,640
They found that with a cycle threshold of 25,

371
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,920
70% of samples were still positive.

372
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,080
At cycle threshold 30, that number dropped to 20,

373
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,720
and that when the cycle threshold was 35,

374
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,480
the number of positive results were less than 3%.

375
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,280
In the publication, they literally

376
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
say that this finding, using more data

377
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,840
than their original set, does not significantly

378
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,720
change the conclusions that had been reached previously.

379
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,920
The finding essentially boiled down to a feeling

380
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,800
that after 10 days, if your PCR test is

381
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,400
at a negative with an under 30 cycle threshold,

382
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,400
then you are almost certainly not going to be contagious.

383
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,960
This is not proof that the PCR tests are always

384
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,920
false positives, nor did a German court

385
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,240
decide that the test is a scam.

386
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,880
Alex has no idea what this story is about,

387
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,040
nor does he even know about the study that

388
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,720
underpins the story.

389
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,480
Even with this information, using the cycle threshold

390
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,680
value to infer whether or not a person is possibly infectious

391
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,000
is not a precise way to interpret these figures,

392
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,560
and some people definitely warn against it.

393
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,720
There are a number of other variables to consider,

394
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,000
but the talking point that's been taken from this

395
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,600
publication and disseminated on right wing media

396
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,400
is that the PCR test has been proven in German courts

397
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,400
to be a false positive rate of 97%, which is complete bullshit.

398
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,600
The court in Portugal ruled that the vacationers

399
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,960
had been illegally detained based on their inability

400
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,000
to find any indication of what the cycle threshold that

401
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,320
was used in their positive test result was,

402
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,840
and thus, in court, they could not defend

403
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,760
their positive diagnosis.

404
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,120
This was a case that was mishandled

405
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,440
by Portuguese authorities, not an indictment

406
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,280
of tests for COVID-19.

407
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,760
I also just, whenever he said that last time,

408
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,640
I was just like, this is a global pandemic

409
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,800
that affects a lot of countries.

410
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,000
I don't care if Germany is like,

411
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,040
Germany's court system can't be like,

412
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,760
eh, they're all full of shit, and I'll buy it.

413
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,520
I just don't, I just don't care.

414
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,920
There are other, there's other countries.

415
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,000
They're all like, I buy it, so I'm buying.

416
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I found another story that I thought was

417
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,840
what Alex was talking about, and it turns out

418
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,600
there was a lab in Germany that processed,

419
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,920
I think in one month they processed 60 tests

420
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,640
and 58 were false positives, and the reason was

421
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,840
because there was a supply shortage,

422
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,040
and their normal reagent was unavailable to them,

423
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,080
so they used an incompatible reagent,

424
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,040
and the mistake was found, and like,

425
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,040
oh, okay, I'll redo all this.

426
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,260
But like, yeah, that was what I kinda thought

427
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,840
would make sense, but then I looked into this story

428
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,360
and was like, oh, this is clearly what's going on.

429
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,800
He just thinks it's German courts,

430
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,520
but it's Portuguese courts, it's German vacationers

431
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,520
in Portugal, and it's a misrepresentation

432
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,160
of what the court decided and the study

433
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,800
that was being introduced, so.

434
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,520
Why would I care what a court decides

435
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,760
about coronavirus anyways?

436
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,520
I don't trust most courts to be in any way impartial

437
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,240
or know what they're talking about.

438
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,760
I guess if a court decided that, I'd like to see it.

439
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,600
Yeah.

440
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,420
I'd like to read it.

441
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,260
Yeah.

442
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,100
Anyway.

443
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,920
I would be interested.

444
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,160
Alex has some heroes on the third,

445
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,900
and they're the people who are staying open

446
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,560
despite COVID.

447
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,400
Okay.

448
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Danny Presetti, he's the owner of the popular restaurant

449
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,440
and bar there on Staten Island.

450
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,440
New York, New York told, hey, you're not essential, buddy.

451
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,100
You can have a little patio out here

452
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,580
and you can have maybe 5% of your patrons

453
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,100
for the whole winter and maybe next year,

454
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,500
you're going to go bankrupt.

455
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,080
They said, no, we're essential.

456
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,500
The police said, we're going to arrest you.

457
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,960
So he said, you know what?

458
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,860
I'm an autonomous zone like the commies,

459
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,340
but they sent in their undercover police.

460
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,180
So you're against it.

461
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,540
They were doing something secret and arrested him.

462
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,060
We'll go ahead and roll the footage of that.

463
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,460
Again, this is the Alex Jones show.

464
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,240
We're into hour number one here.

465
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,020
So Alex has this guy's name wrong.

466
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,780
It's not Danny Presetti.

467
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,060
It's Danny Presti.

468
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,140
And things took a little bit of a turn

469
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,740
between when he recorded this episode

470
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,020
and when we were recording ours.

471
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,840
Okay.

472
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,860
On the night of December 5th,

473
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,400
Danny Presti was arrested,

474
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,340
but it wasn't for keeping his bar open

475
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,620
as an autonomous zone or some shit.

476
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,580
According to NBC4 New York quote,

477
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,180
New York City Sheriff's office said,

478
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,140
deputies attempted to take Danny Presti, 34,

479
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,660
into custody at just after midnight Sunday

480
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,460
after observing patrons entering Mac's public house

481
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,260
via an empty commercial space next door.

482
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,740
Upon identifying themselves,

483
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,940
the Sheriff's office said Presti allegedly fled on foot,

484
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,880
got into his car, drove into one of the deputies,

485
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,180
and then continued driving

486
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,340
with the injured deputy clinging to the hood.

487
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,100
I think that Alex would like to paint this

488
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,060
as a situation where this guy is just like,

489
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,780
you know, I gotta put food on the table

490
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,460
and I'm gonna keep this going.

491
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,060
And nah, he's hitting cops with cars.

492
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,940
Yeah, that'll do it.

493
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,780
Anyway.

494
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,940
That's a little bit different from the heroic story

495
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,240
of fighting back against a government

496
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,060
that's out of control for closing your restaurant

497
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,680
in the midst of a pandemic, trying not to kill people.

498
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,520
Yeah, yeah.

499
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,340
It's a little bit different.

500
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,100
It's gonna be an interesting story to try and weave.

501
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,660
But Alex is really into these small business owners, man.

502
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,840
He's really, really worried about them.

503
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,380
Now let's show you a town in Michigan

504
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,700
where the business owner comes up

505
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,260
and takes over the local live feed

506
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,900
and says, listen, you're forcing me to fight back.

507
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,940
You're bankrupting me.

508
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,940
I tried to get the damn stimulus last time

509
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,580
and I was not eligible.

510
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,300
Listen, we went and tried just to see.

511
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,060
We tried to log on thousands of times

512
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,800
over a couple of months, thousands of times.

513
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,140
I'm talking 20 times a day.

514
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,700
I had like five employees trying

515
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,100
because we were losing a ton of money

516
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,180
and things were falling apart.

517
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,020
And I wanted to just see if we could get it.

518
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,740
Then I hired a law firm to check

519
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,220
and they said, no, you can't get it.

520
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,460
So what would you like?

521
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,980
Amazon got 33 billion.

522
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,800
That's bad.

523
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,640
Of the stimulus money.

524
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,180
This is a disgrace for a couple of reasons.

525
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,480
The first and most obvious is that the stimulus

526
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,600
that was given out and the management of it

527
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,020
was entirely up to his hero,

528
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,060
Donald Trump and his government.

529
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,900
If Trump and the GOP controlled Senate

530
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,540
had been willing to provide more support

531
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,880
for the people who were struggling,

532
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,540
then the stimulus probably would have been much larger.

533
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,520
If Trump's government was at all concerned

534
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,280
with governing and competent leadership,

535
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,180
then the website that Alex had trouble using

536
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,040
probably might've been better.

537
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,620
The people that Alex supports and deifies

538
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,180
are the exact people who could have averted the problem

539
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,220
that he's complaining about,

540
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,940
but Alex refuses to acknowledge that.

541
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,340
It's just so fucking Republican to destroy the country

542
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,300
and then be like, see, government can't work.

543
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,140
Yeah.

544
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,000
The second problem is that if Democrats had been in charge

545
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,340
and a robust stimulus package had been passed

546
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,840
that allowed these small business owners

547
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,660
to comfortably survive this health crisis.

548
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,660
Commies!

549
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,500
Exactly.

550
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,940
Alex would be super against that.

551
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,780
Yep.

552
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,100
He hates welfare and he hates the idea

553
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,540
of a social safety net.

554
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,440
If these business owners were being paid

555
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,500
to close temporarily to deal with the virus,

556
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,100
it would be proof that the nanny state

557
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,540
was trying to make all business owners

558
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,640
dependent on them to survive.

559
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,400
In a situation like the one we're in,

560
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,980
there is nothing that leaders can do

561
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,740
that will appease the shithead fake populists like Alex.

562
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,580
You got it.

563
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,040
If they pass massive spending bills

564
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,020
to take care of the public,

565
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,760
it's proof of a communist conspiracy

566
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,140
trying to pacify the population in order to make up serfs.

567
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,200
If they don't pass massive spending bills

568
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
to take care of people,

569
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,460
it's proof that they only care about Jeff Bezos,

570
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,420
which is proof that it's a grand conspiracy

571
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,800
to make you dependent on Bezos,

572
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,540
which will bring in communism or something.

573
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,380
Sure.

574
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,380
This is the part of Alex's politics that's a trap.

575
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,460
The joke is on you if you take him seriously

576
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,620
because he doesn't give a shit about any of this.

577
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,420
It's emotionally satisfying to yell

578
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,760
about the small business owners

579
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,060
who were hurt by the shutdown,

580
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,540
but his principles don't allow any other response

581
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,660
to a crisis like this.

582
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

583
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,940
The only thing he can actually advocate

584
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,860
is acting like there is no virus,

585
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,980
which sounds better when you just present it

586
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,420
as yelling about these poor business owners.

587
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,220
I agree, though, that business owners have been fucked over

588
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,020
in this case, 100%.

589
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,340
But Bezos haven't.

590
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,620
Yeah, I don't think that there's problems

591
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,740
with some of the descriptive things

592
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,100
that Alex is talking about. Totally.

593
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,000
I'll just never respect him to speak on the subject

594
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,580
because he's not a sincere, genuine actor in this.

595
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,820
He's full of shit. No, it's the way

596
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,900
it always works.

597
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,520
Whenever things are going well, relatively speaking,

598
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,360
Republicans are like,

599
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,260
see, they could be going better

600
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,800
if we just got away with all this regulation and shit.

601
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,640
And then people are like,

602
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,820
yeah, that's a great idea.

603
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,020
And they elect Republicans

604
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,860
and Republicans destroy everything.

605
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,700
And then by the time we're here,

606
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,540
four years later, whenever we're not going to have one,

607
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,060
they switch their tune and they're like,

608
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,220
why hasn't government done anything for us?

609
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,860
And it's like, Alex is the only person

610
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,140
that forces me to constantly say like, how dare you?

611
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,180
There's so much drama written in how dare you?

612
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,940
And it's kind of overused and boring,

613
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,780
but Alex doing that makes me just go, how dare you, sir?

614
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,240
Yeah, I think he's the only person

615
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,300
because he's the only person we look at this much.

616
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,300
Yeah, that's true.

617
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,620
I bet if we covered Rush-

618
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,140
No, no, I'd do 300 other people a day.

619
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,380
But I mean, if we did a show about Rush Limbaugh,

620
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,580
I guarantee you he'd be saying,

621
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,100
how dare you, Mr. Limbaugh.

622
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,940
No, of course.

623
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,780
Or Hannity or any of them.

624
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,620
Of course, they're full of shit.

625
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:16,140
Yeah, so on this day, Alex is pretty excited

626
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,740
because he has that Rogan interview already recorded.

627
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,580
Sure.

628
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,780
And you know, I think it's been my contention

629
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,980
and I don't know, what's stronger than a contention?

630
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,820
Certainty?

631
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,380
Yeah, I would say certainty works.

632
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,340
I'm positive.

633
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,180
Concluding?

634
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,340
Yeah, Alex is using Joe Rogan to try and appeal

635
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,660
to a wider audience than he has access to.

636
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,740
And it's kind of nice that Alex just outright says so.

637
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,860
We're gonna air some of the highlights and excerpts

638
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,220
coming up at the bottom of the next hour.

639
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,420
And then at about one o'clock or so,

640
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,180
we're gonna post the full four plus hour interview.

641
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,500
And the reason this is important is,

642
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,700
everything Joe does gets millions of views.

643
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,100
And everything he does with me gets 20, 30, 40 million views

644
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,260
and with a lot of other people interviews are,

645
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,460
or he talks to her big as well.

646
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,260
But Joe doesn't do a lot of interviews.

647
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,140
And so this is a great way to reach out to new people

648
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,620
that, oh, I don't wanna look at Alex Jones,

649
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,100
but they'll look at something that Joe Rogan's doing.

650
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,100
And so this is a powerful interview.

651
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,940
This is an important thing to understand

652
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,100
and this is why Joe's kind of being used here,

653
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,700
is that Alex has a pretty keen awareness

654
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,260
that people look at this if it's Joe,

655
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,580
but they won't look at it if it's me because I'm a lunatic.

656
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,580
Now, the issue for me comes down to,

657
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,580
do you remember, I'm pretending Joe's listening now.

658
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,420
Yes, yeah, yeah.

659
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,980
Do you remember when Alex was screaming

660
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,180
about your kids on air?

661
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,020
Sure.

662
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,300
Do you remember when he was calling you a sneaky snake

663
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,700
and saying he was going to destroy you?

664
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,540
Yeah.

665
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,900
Do you remember when he said that you were a globalist?

666
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,740
Right.

667
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,620
Do you remember all that stuff?

668
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,800
That was when you weren't making yourself available

669
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,820
to be used.

670
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,660
So wait, are you saying-

671
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,620
That was in response to when you got on your show

672
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,340
and said that you can't have Alex on

673
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,660
because of the Sandy Hook stuff.

674
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,020
Oh no, he's my friend.

675
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,180
No, you said he was not somebody who your platform

676
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,380
was available to, he talked about your fucking kids

677
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,300
on his show, said he was going to chop you up

678
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,340
like a sneaky snake.

679
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,500
That's just how he talks.

680
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,020
And then now, oh what do you know,

681
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,700
your platform's available to him.

682
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,300
You're gonna come, you live in Austin,

683
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,440
you're gonna come on his show,

684
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,160
he gets to use you for publicity.

685
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,980
Now all of a sudden you're not a sneaky snake,

686
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,820
you're one of the best.

687
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,940
I have a history of unhealthy relationships.

688
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,020
Is that what you wanted to hear?

689
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,580
Jesus, how fucking transparently obvious could this be?

690
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,060
Like- I was thinking it's,

691
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,100
look, we knew it, he knew it,

692
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,820
maybe Joe is the only person who doesn't know it,

693
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,860
but he probably knows it too.

694
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,880
If he doesn't, he has the most awesome mentality

695
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,500
and I'm jealous of him and the naivete.

696
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,740
Yeah, he lives a better life.

697
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,740
Yeah.

698
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,900
But at the same time, whenever he said it,

699
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,540
I was like, well, that's gauche.

700
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,900
That's a little, look, that's a little gauche.

701
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,460
Look, here's the deal.

702
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,780
I'm trying to use this dude to Trojan horse

703
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,660
my extremist views onto audiences

704
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,360
that know better than to listen to me.

705
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,020
Look, we all know that, but it's tacky to say it.

706
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,300
Right.

707
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,060
So I had a nightmare the other night.

708
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,460
I know that it's also not great to talk about dreams.

709
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,260
And it was that our show disappeared

710
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,180
because of like copyright issues.

711
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,020
Sure.

712
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,060
You know, I know this is fair use

713
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,320
through using Alex's stuff,

714
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,200
but it's still something that worries me is like,

715
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,820
hey, is there a possibility that, you know,

716
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,020
we could have all of our episodes taken down.

717
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,260
Don't give him ideas.

718
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,940
Well, it's too late because on his show,

719
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,140
he gave us permission to do this show.

720
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,220
Oh, that's good.

721
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,660
By the way, everything I do is free to air.

722
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,700
Everything I do is copyright free,

723
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,500
meaning that you can take it, you can share it,

724
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,380
you can edit it, you can cut it,

725
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,340
you can play it on your show.

726
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,260
We get so many emails and so many letters saying,

727
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,680
can I paint Infowars on my barn?

728
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,680
Or can I make copies of your DVD and get them out?

729
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,520
You better.

730
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,500
You better.

731
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,780
So apparently not only do we have his blessing,

732
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,220
we have his insistence that we do this show.

733
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,740
Dear Alex Jones at Infowars,

734
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,620
my barn is looking a little worn down.

735
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,060
Do you think I could paint Infowars upon the side of it, sir?

736
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,380
Alex, I wanted to paint Infowars on my barn,

737
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,020
but I was worried about getting sued.

738
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,460
Yeah.

739
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,100
Hey, Rob, Rob Dew,

740
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,340
I got word that someone in Nebraska

741
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,220
has got some paint cans.

742
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,240
Rob, Rob, you know how we will do-

743
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,300
Call Robert Barnes.

744
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,700
Rob, we will do anything and everything for free publicity,

745
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,820
but this one time, look, I fucking hate Barnes.

746
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,900
That's what it is.

747
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,020
I hate Robert Barnes and I hate Barnes.

748
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,860
The end.

749
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,940
Maybe that's what the person was asking for permission for

750
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,500
is to paint it on Robert Barnes.

751
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,340
Now-

752
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,180
That does require permission.

753
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,280
That probably does.

754
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,140
And Alex's permission too about Barnes.

755
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,620
This was back when Barnes was an employee.

756
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,360
So like I said, he's, you know,

757
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,340
Rogan is making himself available

758
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,960
and helping Alex get attention.

759
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,380
And so that means that he is brave.

760
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,220
He is a big, brave boy.

761
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,820
And it turns out that Tucker Carlson,

762
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,380
while his rhetoric is good,

763
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,540
he's not somebody that is going to have Alex on his show.

764
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,380
What a whiny-

765
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,380
So he's not as good as Rogan.

766
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,660
So you can sit back and say,

767
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,620
oh, well, Joe Rogan should do more.

768
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,380
No one else in his position is.

769
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,100
And look, I like Tucker Carlson.

770
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,920
I admire him.

771
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,760
He's a friend.

772
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,140
We talk.

773
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,440
I'll leave it at that.

774
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,740
But I'm banned from going on his show.

775
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,220
And he used to plug Info Wars on there.

776
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,460
And, you know, obviously you don't see that anymore.

777
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,260
Cause they, you know, it's, it's, it's,

778
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,520
nobody's been willing to go to bat for me

779
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,800
in a big position of power.

780
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,640
Oh no.

781
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,440
Other than Trump behind the scenes.

782
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,340
And, you know, Biden gets in.

783
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,380
I got told last week, hell, I got told two days ago.

784
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,220
You're fucked.

785
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,740
That I'm enemy number two.

786
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,740
He said, Jones, I got this call.

787
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,860
Even in your imagination, you're number two.

788
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,060
Works with the Clintons as a Republican.

789
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,660
He said, Jones, you had enough yet?

790
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,060
You ready to come in out of the cold?

791
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,140
And I said, just as soon as you stop running slave camps

792
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,420
in China, just as soon as you guys stop being involved

793
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,260
in pedophilia.

794
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,100
How about that?

795
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,920
How about that?

796
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,760
How about that?

797
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,900
How about that?

798
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,140
How about that thoroughly fictitious person

799
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,740
that I didn't invent right now.

800
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,780
Here's some tough talk for you voice in my head.

801
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,580
Yeah, Alex is public enemy number two.

802
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,660
Once Biden gets in there, I don't even know.

803
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,300
I would be interested to find out

804
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,700
if Biden actually even knows who Alex Jones is.

805
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,500
I would imagine there's a possibility,

806
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,300
but there's also a possibility that he doesn't.

807
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,140
I think the people around Biden would know Jones.

808
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,580
I don't think Biden has ever actually been like,

809
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,680
I don't think they even need to broach the subject.

810
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,180
Like he might've gone like,

811
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,180
Hey, who's this Alex Jones character?

812
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,580
And they're like, listen, you don't need to worry about it.

813
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,660
Here's what I would say.

814
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,980
He is as aware of Alex Jones

815
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,860
as I am of the Property Brothers.

816
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,740
Sure.

817
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,740
That probably sounds right. I know that show exists.

818
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,580
It does.

819
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,740
And there are a couple of them.

820
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,060
I've seen them somewhere.

821
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,420
I don't know what their show is about.

822
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,240
Smiling.

823
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,080
I guess.

824
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,020
Yeah, mainly.

825
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,060
I would imagine that it's kind of like that.

826
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,060
He's aware of Alex's existence,

827
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,660
but probably has no idea.

828
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,940
That's my sense on it.

829
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,540
I would prefer if Alex Jones did

830
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,280
a Property Brothers type thing.

831
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,280
What if he just fixed houses on TV?

832
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,120
That'd be great.

833
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,940
Poorly?

834
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,700
Yeah, that'd be the best part.

835
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,940
He does the exact same amount of work.

836
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,780
I would be into it.

837
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,620
Yeah, I'd watch that.

838
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,060
So someone's called him and says that the DOJ under Biden

839
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,300
is gonna come at you.

840
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,180
They're gonna come after you.

841
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,020
I'd be fine with that.

842
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,500
But there's a possibility though,

843
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,940
that this is all just a ploy.

844
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,220
They're trying to get Alex onto the team.

845
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,220
I don't want to be given immunity by you

846
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,060
because you don't have it from God.

847
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,620
I've got my immunity.

848
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,780
Thank you very much.

849
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,620
All right.

850
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,780
Paul looks so inviting.

851
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,480
Oh, all the money, all the private jets,

852
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,620
all the best medicine, all the best sex,

853
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,940
all the best drugs, just Jones, we love you.

854
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,340
Just come with us.

855
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,180
Come.

856
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,540
You don't think I get hate from the enemy.

857
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,920
You know, it's like, oh, Jones,

858
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,260
we know you're gonna make the right decision.

859
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,500
We know you're gonna come over to us, Jones.

860
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,420
Come to us.

861
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,540
Come here.

862
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,480
Come to us.

863
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,320
Come.

864
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,540
Come to us.

865
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,680
No.

866
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,580
Meanwhile, all these corporate lawyers

867
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,020
and all these sellouts would do,

868
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,380
they'd kill their firstborn to be part of this.

869
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,280
It's disgusting.

870
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,960
And I won't be part of it.

871
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,220
And I'll stay in this fight

872
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,020
as long as you keep me in the fight.

873
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,860
Hey, man.

874
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,680
Two things that are back in stock.

875
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,920
Prosta guards have been sold out for quite a while.

876
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,760
Oof.

877
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,660
Oof.

878
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,020
Oh, boy.

879
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,860
That's amazing.

880
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,680
Oh, boy.

881
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,520
Oh, God.

882
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,820
You could just, you could hear him looking at the clock.

883
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,660
Totally.

884
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,480
You could hear him

885
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,320
tiling it out to break.

886
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,420
Come, come, come.

887
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,260
15 seconds left.

888
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,500
Come, come.

889
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,500
20 seconds left.

890
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,860
How did I get the, yeah.

891
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,540
Prosta guards back in stock.

892
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,020
So stupid.

893
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,620
They try and steal me away from you guys

894
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,900
and the only thing keeping me from them is your money.

895
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,320
I'm gonna stay in this fight

896
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,040
as long as you're giving me money, too.

897
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,880
But let me tell you,

898
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,300
I have offers that others would kill their children for.

899
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,340
Listen, here's what I'm telling you.

900
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,500
The moment I don't have your money,

901
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,740
I'm on their team for money.

902
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,060
Sounds heroic.

903
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,620
Yeah.

904
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,780
Now, admittedly, I've gotten none of those offers

905
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,620
that I lied about.

906
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,440
No.

907
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,940
And the DOJ is not gonna come after you.

908
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,100
Doubtful.

909
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,820
So Alex goes to commercial after talking about Prosta Guard

910
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,980
and man, he loves that song, Bad to the Bone.

911
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,820
Yeah.

912
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,060
And I would say that it sucks.

913
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,500
I would say, and I'm sorry.

914
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,340
The part where he goes,

915
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,100
buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

916
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,940
Do you like that part?

917
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,220
I just, it's so droning.

918
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,020
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

919
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,080
Bad.

920
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,020
That's what I would say it is.

921
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,460
It's buh buh buh buh bad as a song.

922
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,500
Anyway, Alex is listening to this

923
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,540
and he's just loving it.

924
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,740
He just fucking loves it.

925
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,820
And then he has this weird fantasy.

926
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,300
I wanna be yours, pretty baby.

927
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,740
Yours and yours alone.

928
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,620
And I'm here to tell you

929
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,260
that I'm bad to the bone.

930
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,900
Buh buh buh bad.

931
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,060
Bad to the bone.

932
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,140
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

933
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,820
Some good music right here.

934
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,860
So like I'm cruising on the highway at night.

935
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,700
About 120.

936
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,740
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

937
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,700
It's a nice cruise to speak.

938
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,540
With the desert.

939
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,980
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

940
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,780
Till that jack rabbit runs out in front of you.

941
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,620
What just happened?

942
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,460
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

943
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,420
The car starts spinning.

944
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,060
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

945
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,860
The way out in the desert a hundred yards.

946
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,820
Lucky you're not dead.

947
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,660
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

948
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:46,060
The way out in the desert a hundred and fifty down the highway.

949
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,900
What?

950
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,740
I've got a message to present.

951
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,300
A message to all of you.

952
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,140
Okay.

953
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,100
All right.

954
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,940
It's fantasy.

955
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,860
Is that message learn the wrong lessons from things?

956
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,940
Yeah.

957
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,780
That's, oh yeah.

958
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,500
I mean, I guess that's a metaphor for his career.

959
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,340
Yeah.

960
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,580
He's like, you're driving irresponsibly.

961
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,540
You get knocked off the road by happenstance.

962
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,380
And then you go.

963
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,380
Twice as fast, baby.

964
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,460
Just as irresponsible.

965
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,540
Let's keep on going.

966
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,860
Yeah.

967
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,060
I would say that's a bad fantasy.

968
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,340
You know, like why not just keep on driving

969
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,900
down the desert road at 120.

970
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,740
Yeah.

971
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,580
It's a fantasy.

972
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,500
That jackrabbit does not have to be there.

973
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,140
I mean, I guess stories aren't interesting

974
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,940
without conflict of some sort.

975
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,020
You know, you have to have a,

976
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,420
I guess this is more of a man versus nature

977
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,740
kind of thematic story about.

978
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,100
The story as it is with context, not interesting.

979
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,700
Could be man versus self.

980
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,260
That could be a good starting point.

981
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,620
Alex is the jackrabbit.

982
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,460
Exactly.

983
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,380
So he wants to take some time here on this episode

984
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,820
to play clips of his Rogan interview.

985
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,660
Sure.

986
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,540
He wants to bring that into the show itself.

987
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,340
But there's a problem.

988
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,900
There's a problem.

989
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,740
It's copyrighted.

990
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,020
No.

991
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,780
People haven't edited those clips.

992
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,260
You know, I've got this big Trump clip

993
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,420
that I think is the best out of the 49 minutes speech.

994
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,380
We're going to air when we come back after that.

995
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,580
And then I guess we'll push other guests

996
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,020
back into the Joe Rogan stuff tomorrow, maybe.

997
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:14,420
Oh, because I'm not sure we can hear that.

998
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,940
But, you know, there's there's there's there's so much more.

999
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:24,900
To get to here today and so many angles to all of this bullshit.

1000
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:29,340
But. I'm being sarcastic this morning.

1001
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,900
I said, can I just have three clips,

1002
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,500
just one clip from each person involved editing this?

1003
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,780
And I'm just going to hear those at 1230.

1004
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,660
It's going to be like 15 clips and I don't have them yet.

1005
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,460
And I'm not mad.

1006
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,020
It's just we just won't do it,

1007
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,580
because that's the only power I've got at this point

1008
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,660
is that every time we do this, just to give up,

1009
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,700
because I got a lot of political news

1010
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,140
and a lot of the sphere covered.

1011
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,020
At least I can post the whole Joe Rogan interview.

1012
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,300
We can get that done demand on video.

1013
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,940
So that should be up by that should be up by next hour for you.

1014
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,020
But again, the news websites are info wars dot com

1015
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,980
and news wars dot com and so much more.

1016
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,980
Separately. To fund this operation,

1017
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,620
we need your support.

1018
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:17,260
A lot of a lot of ad transitions.

1019
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,540
I do appreciate the idea that he's saying, like, OK,

1020
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,700
when these things happen, the only power I have is to give up,

1021
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,020
which kind of means like I run this whole thing

1022
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,140
and I'm going on strike against my subordinate.

1023
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,820
How dare my subordinates do what?

1024
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,460
What are we doing? What's the problem here?

1025
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,020
Oh, wait, they gave me more options than I had requested.

1026
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,340
Overachievers, a bunch of dicks, 15 clips here

1027
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,580
instead of the three that I had requested.

1028
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,580
I can't possibly be bothered to look through

1029
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,500
and choose the ones I want to use.

1030
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,020
No, I must on air throw a tantrum and threaten to go on strike.

1031
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:55,660
I this is the type of stuff where you go, you know what?

1032
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,900
A lot of people think this guy is a leader.

1033
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,700
Yeah, the only the only thing I have left to me

1034
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,460
is to give up in the face of adversity.

1035
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,100
And the when there is a challenge, I say no.

1036
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,060
And the adversity is like something you could sort out

1037
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,060
during a commercial break easily.

1038
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:18,660
Oh, just oh, hey, hey, guys, could you pick a couple of those clips

1039
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,380
for me and then just send them over real quick?

1040
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,540
Cool. If the devil is up against this guy,

1041
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,540
if like this guy is the dude who's like going to stand up to the devil,

1042
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:31,020
I'd be like, I guess I could just inconvenience him a little.

1043
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,020
Maybe this is the devil doesn't even have to destroy Alex

1044
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,540
or any kind of elaborate plan.

1045
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,700
He could just make his life a little annoying.

1046
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,500
And I was like, fuck it. I don't care.

1047
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,260
Maybe this is God like flexing on Satan.

1048
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,540
Like, see, this is how much better than you I am.

1049
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,180
I'm going to pick Alex Jones as your mortal enemy.

1050
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,940
It's like it's like Braun Strowman

1051
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,700
winning the tag team championship with a 12 year old child.

1052
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,900
All right, here's here's who we've got going up against Ivan Drago.

1053
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,580
Mr. Magoo. Oh, quite a match.

1054
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,500
Yeah, that'll do it.

1055
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,380
So Alex does finally get some clips of Rogan.

1056
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:09,500
Like, I am probably going to have to do this as an episode.

1057
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:15,420
Oh, no. But like, they sound so fucked up just in this one clip that they play.

1058
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,740
Oh, God.

1059
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:24,900
And I understand that you'd be reluctant to ever accept or or multiply.

1060
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,500
Awful ideas, but the best way to combat

1061
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,420
that and it's been shown throughout history is better ideas.

1062
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,140
The simplest way to combat that is to shut it down.

1063
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:41,260
It's like if you have a kid and you're and you say you got to go to bed

1064
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,220
and your kid goes, why do I have to go to bed?

1065
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,820
And you go, shut the fuck up.

1066
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,900
It's sort of the same thing.

1067
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,740
Dad, is that you?

1068
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,140
It's a crazy interview, four plus hours long, a lot of leaves, a lot of surprises.

1069
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,540
Yeah, a lot of surprises.

1070
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:03,900
I guess Joe's implying in that clip that you should debate your child about bedtimes.

1071
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,580
Yeah. Yep.

1072
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:10,460
OK, well, also in that context, you're framing yourself as the child.

1073
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,780
And the parent does make the rules.

1074
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,220
You got it.

1075
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,060
So the bedtime is the bedtime.

1076
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,900
That would make sense.

1077
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:21,100
And so if the bedtime is sort of analogous to being kicked off social media,

1078
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,060
you're going to abide by the bedtime.

1079
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,740
Yeah.

1080
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,100
Whether you fall asleep or not, it's on you.

1081
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:30,420
But you're going to be in that bed because they're your fucking parents.

1082
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,860
In many ways, one thing that you are learning how to be

1083
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:38,580
is a member of society in so far as your actions affect others.

1084
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:44,220
And in the same way, the people who are doing this bullshit

1085
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:49,420
are children who need to be part of society, which means there are rules.

1086
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,780
Yeah, yeah.

1087
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,940
The metaphor may work not in the way he wants,

1088
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,860
but it might work a lot better than he realizes.

1089
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1090
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:02,260
Anyway, I think one of the reasons that Joe sounds so fucked up in that clip

1091
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,140
is I think they did something to the audio.

1092
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,140
His voice doesn't sound right.

1093
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,700
It's either sped up slightly or slow.

1094
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,940
I don't know what it is, but it doesn't have the same tone

1095
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,940
as Joe's voice normally does.

1096
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,100
So I don't know what it is.

1097
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,620
I think somebody messed that up.

1098
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,460
Nah, he probably just has better sound people on his own show.

1099
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,540
I don't think so because I listen to, like I said,

1100
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,500
the first half hour or 20 minutes of it, and it doesn't sound like that.

1101
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,580
No, there was something wrong with the replay of it.

1102
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,620
Oh, boy.

1103
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,980
But yeah, it's like...

1104
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,060
Well, the only option we have here, Dan, is to give up.

1105
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,260
Got to.

1106
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,900
If this is the level of kind of amazing interview they had

1107
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,500
where they're like, don't yell at your kid to go to bed,

1108
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,180
I can't wait.

1109
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,860
I can't wait for four hours of that.

1110
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:48,100
See, what you got to do is be like, hey kid,

1111
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,340
let me tell you about bed, all right?

1112
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,420
What you got to do with bed is you get into the bedroom,

1113
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,260
you lay in bed, you fall asleep.

1114
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,580
If you don't do that, you're going to hell.

1115
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:04,740
If Joe's point is that, like, a parent should explain to a child

1116
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,020
who's curious about why there's a bedtime,

1117
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,820
why it's healthy and they need to go to bed,

1118
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,580
like, if that's the case and he wants to make that equivalent to, like,

1119
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,620
social media platforms should be a little bit more transparent,

1120
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,860
I'll go with you.

1121
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,100
But I also don't think that, like,

1122
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,340
I don't think the decisions that have been made are, like,

1123
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,460
kicking Alex off, stuff like that.

1124
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,260
I don't think that would be overturned by transparency.

1125
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,020
Also, I would like to know Alex's take on whether or not

1126
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,900
he explains bedtime very clearly.

1127
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,060
He's curious.

1128
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:43,380
So we jump to the fourth now, and here's how we open this egg up.

1129
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,740
We are 48 days out from the inauguration of Donald John

1130
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,580
Trump if we fight back.

1131
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:54,220
The evidence is now red-handed in all five states

1132
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:59,060
with the red-handed video of the illegal sequential ballots.

1133
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,380
Devastating.

1134
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,420
If Trump can get his hands on those, it's game over.

1135
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,140
Game over.

1136
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,540
Game over as he can get his hands on them.

1137
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,300
But unfortunately, you know, he doesn't have the power of,

1138
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,340
like, an entire government behind him.

1139
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:12,940
Nope.

1140
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,540
Can't do it.

1141
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:13,980
Can't do it.

1142
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,340
Well, I mean, this is all just, like,

1143
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,180
I get really bored of a lot of this,

1144
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,220
because it's just Alex repeating and amplifying,

1145
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,860
like, Rudy Giuliani nonsense.

1146
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,180
I just kind of, like, it's exhausting.

1147
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,140
It's exhausting.

1148
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,100
Go home and bleed your hair dye there.

1149
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,380
Alex has big news, though.

1150
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:32,940
What's that?

1151
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,060
Well, I have big news.

1152
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,540
What's that?

1153
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,220
And that is Alex has been reading.

1154
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,740
I would like proof.

1155
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,660
I would bet that.

1156
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,620
Let me give you the big news.

1157
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,660
Let me give you the big news here.

1158
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,420
I spent hours this morning and hours last night

1159
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,180
at Infowars.com and at GatewayPundit.com

1160
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:56,220
and at NationalFile.com and very little time on Breitbart,

1161
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,180
because they are really starting to drop the ball

1162
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,060
and turn against Trump.

1163
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,860
Very disgusting.

1164
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,100
But I guess that Mercer money must be good.

1165
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,700
Very sad.

1166
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,660
I like Breitbart.

1167
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,020
Huh.

1168
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,940
Think about that a little more, why don't you?

1169
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,100
Think about that a little bit more, what you're saying, Alex.

1170
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,060
What does it imply?

1171
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,500
What does it imply about Breitbart?

1172
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,580
What does it imply about?

1173
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,660
I think what it implies about Breitbart

1174
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,460
is that it only produces content based

1175
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,660
upon what billionaires would like.

1176
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,340
Huh.

1177
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,780
Interesting.

1178
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,060
Also, what does that imply about things like Parler,

1179
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,420
your social media network that you really

1180
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,660
seem to like that has a bunch of Mercer money going to it?

1181
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,740
It seems like they would only allow things

1182
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,260
that the Mercers would want.

1183
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:40,140
I just think it's best not to use that

1184
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,660
as an attack on Breitbart, because they're out of pocket

1185
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,740
or whatever.

1186
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,180
It's going to be too complicated for you

1187
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,500
to thread that needle, Alex.

1188
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,060
Don't do it.

1189
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,140
I would leave it alone.

1190
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:53,900
That's like following the money in an investigation.

1191
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,220
If you follow the money, you're going to get corrupt

1192
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:56,940
politicians.

1193
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,940
It's going to happen, because they are.

1194
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,260
So don't follow the money.

1195
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,900
Well, you know what happens with corrupt politicians?

1196
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,420
What's that?

1197
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,380
They put ballots in black crates.

1198
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,460
And then they count those ballots, corruptly.

1199
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,580
Damn them.

1200
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,380
One of these stories should turn the whole election over,

1201
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,820
because it's so organized.

1202
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:17,300
But there's hundreds with video in dozens

1203
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,700
of cases of the fraud.

1204
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,460
People looking over their shoulder, kicking everybody

1205
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,820
out, saying a water pipe broke.

1206
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:25,780
That's bad enough.

1207
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,820
That should overturn it.

1208
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,300
Then they pull out all the black crates from under the table

1209
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,820
and look like Sylvester when he's caught

1210
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:37,980
with Tweety Bird in his mouth and start

1211
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,420
running the sons of bitches.

1212
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,020
And then it turns out they're all Biden votes.

1213
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,460
So this was a video that Rudy Giuliani had entered

1214
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,300
into his evidence as proof of illegal votes

1215
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,300
being counted in the Georgia State Farm arena.

1216
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,900
It was alleged that these were secret illegal ballots that

1217
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,380
were produced from black boxes when no one was looking.

1218
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:54,900
Sure.

1219
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,300
The surveillance video was reviewed

1220
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,620
by election officials who said that there was literally

1221
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,620
nothing abnormal about the video and that these

1222
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,860
weren't illegal ballots.

1223
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:06,700
If the material of the box is made of can't be harved,

1224
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,340
why not make the ballots out of?

1225
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,740
Gabriel Sterling, the voting systems manager in Georgia,

1226
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,620
said, quote, the 90-second video of election workers

1227
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,740
at State Farm arena purporting to show fraud

1228
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,700
was watched in its entirety, hours of footage,

1229
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,660
not just the 90 seconds, by Georgia Secretary of State

1230
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,260
investigators, shows normal ballot processing.

1231
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,420
Oh, damn them.

1232
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,060
Once again, we have Trump's goons

1233
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,300
trying to manufacture a voter fraud narrative out

1234
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,460
of the appearance of something that they think looks

1235
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,540
suspicious.

1236
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,780
The fact that they keep doing this and each time it

1237
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,420
turns out to be nothing should make his followers wary

1238
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:43,580
the next time Rudy or Alex find some supposed irregularity.

1239
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,100
But some people fall from multiple doomsday

1240
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,380
predictions, so there's no telling.

1241
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,340
Yeah.

1242
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:53,460
The end of the earth is on December 21, 2012.

1243
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,940
OK, December 21.

1244
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,100
I got it wrong.

1245
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,820
It's on December 21, 200, 2100.

1246
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,940
So guys, come on, follow me for the next 100 years or so.

1247
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:03,740
We'll be all right.

1248
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,580
Yeah.

1249
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,700
It's just, it's exhausting.

1250
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:13,340
And I think that these are thin and I just, I don't know.

1251
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:17,340
I lose my patience with covering the same topic

1252
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,780
over and over again.

1253
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,540
So I was very excited to hear this.

1254
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,180
I don't know if it's true that La Cosa Nostra, the mafia,

1255
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,020
had Jagger Hoover dressed up like a woman.

1256
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,100
I don't know if he was gay.

1257
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,500
I really don't care.

1258
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:36,260
The point is, is that he did say that the mafia did not exist.

1259
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,820
OK?

1260
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,740
He gave testimony in the 40s and early 50s

1261
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:45,780
that the mafia did not exist.

1262
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,500
OK?

1263
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,020
The reason that Jagger Hoover was

1264
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,340
in denial about the existence of the mafia was that,

1265
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,140
at the time, the FBI was basically

1266
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,780
entirely focused on investigating

1267
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,300
alleged communists and surveilling left wing

1268
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:56,860
activists.

1269
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:57,460
Yeah.

1270
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,340
He didn't see going after mafia actors

1271
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,060
as a good use of resources, since organized crime could

1272
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,980
be difficult to prosecute.

1273
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,460
And they were rich, so they could bribe people.

1274
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,500
They gave people a lot of money, which is,

1275
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,580
that was one of their.

1276
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,420
Following the money.

1277
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,820
No, that was a good idea.

1278
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,260
You give people money if you want

1279
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,020
them to investigate leftists.

1280
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:15,700
Yeah.

1281
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:18,060
If Alex had been around in 1955, he

1282
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,620
would have been enthusiastically supporting the FBI,

1283
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,300
leaving the mafia alone, saying they're just

1284
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,820
good Americana businessmen.

1285
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,140
What are you, hate Italians now?

1286
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,020
Come on!

1287
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,740
The FBI had bigger issues, like how literally everyone

1288
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,180
I don't like is a communist.

1289
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,940
That's what you've got to be spending your time on.

1290
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,580
These good, God-fearing Catholics over here,

1291
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,300
just trying to make a living in the new world,

1292
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,540
and you're going to ignore them, and you're

1293
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,700
going to go after the commies.

1294
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,780
That's what you do.

1295
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,700
That's more or less.

1296
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,580
That's the way you do it.

1297
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,460
So Alex is like, you know, he's sitting here,

1298
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,220
he's talking about these globalists.

1299
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,020
They're a menace.

1300
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,740
They want to depopulate everybody.

1301
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,380
They want to kill off the entire world.

1302
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,380
So does he, though.

1303
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,300
But the globalists, they seem to have like a gun to their head.

1304
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,820
But it's an alien gun.

1305
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,340
Ooh.

1306
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,620
But Alex is talking about this, and he

1307
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,780
realizes this sounds silly.

1308
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,340
Is that more dangerous than a?

1309
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:04,860
Yes.

1310
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:05,380
Oh, OK.

1311
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,380
Far more dangerous.

1312
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,220
Absolutely.

1313
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,140
But it's at your head.

1314
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,460
Yeah, but it's, I mean, look.

1315
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,380
You could survive a gunshot to your head

1316
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,620
if it went just the, not an alien gun.

1317
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,660
An alien will blow you up.

1318
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,180
Oh, totally.

1319
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:18,700
OK, OK.

1320
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,100
So anyway, he realizes this sounds

1321
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,140
a little silly in the middle.

1322
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,060
This is like a kamikaze action.

1323
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,860
It's like somebody's got a gun to these people's heads.

1324
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,100
You will depopulate your planet, or we will destroy it all.

1325
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:31,700
Hey, Marvin.

1326
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,460
I mean, if I was a military tactician, I'd say,

1327
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,460
this doesn't make sense.

1328
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,900
It's like aliens have a gun to their heads to do this.

1329
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,700
This is not going to be popular.

1330
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,980
If I was a military tactician.

1331
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,420
It doesn't help people.

1332
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,020
And I'm not even saying it's aliens.

1333
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:48,020
I'm saying the Bible says it's an alien.

1334
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:48,740
OK.

1335
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,540
Colonel, Colonel, I just, we can't figure out why.

1336
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,460
I'm pretty sure that aliens have a gun to their head.

1337
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,660
It's got to be an alien gun.

1338
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,940
It's got to be alien guns.

1339
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:02,500
I just grow so tired of trying to save face by being like,

1340
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,820
I'm not saying aliens, but the Bible says it's an alien.

1341
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,500
Yeah, the Bible says it.

1342
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,140
You're saying it's an alien.

1343
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:09,940
Cut it out.

1344
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,460
You believe everything the Bible says,

1345
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,980
so if the Bible says it's an alien,

1346
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,100
you're saying it's an alien.

1347
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:14,500
Right.

1348
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,540
That's the next question I would like to ask him.

1349
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,380
If you were to present this in my presence, I would say,

1350
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,660
so you're saying it's an alien.

1351
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,220
And he would say, no, I'm not saying I'm just saying

1352
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:22,820
the Bible says it's an alien.

1353
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:23,820
So you don't believe the Bible.

1354
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:24,420
Exactly.

1355
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,820
That would be the next question.

1356
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,940
And he'd be like, oh, well, blah, blah, blah.

1357
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:28,900
So it's an alien.

1358
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,460
Wow, the Bible says it's an alien.

1359
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,620
So you don't believe the Bible.

1360
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,100
Look, I'm not saying it's an alien.

1361
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:33,740
I'm just saying.

1362
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,380
I'm starting to feel like we could do this for a while.

1363
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,460
Yeah.

1364
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,580
So yeah, Alex's enemies, they have an alien gun

1365
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,020
to their head, but they're also the people

1366
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,260
who James Bond villains are based on.

1367
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,300
I don't know if you know that.

1368
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:45,900
The aliens?

1369
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,420
They all look like Dr. Evil.

1370
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,180
Why does Dr. Evil look like that?

1371
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:54,180
Because Hollywood knows these people look like.

1372
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,260
Or?

1373
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,820
Where's his mini me?

1374
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,820
Well, that one is actually an interesting story.

1375
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,740
Have you ever seen the island of Dr. Moreau?

1376
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,740
You're going to take it.

1377
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,220
You're going to drink sewage and eat weeds.

1378
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,300
He said that last week.

1379
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:06,820
Val Buehler.

1380
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,660
The whole diet will be sewage, bugs, and weeds.

1381
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,340
I'm not kidding.

1382
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,060
He had the club.

1383
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:11,900
See Marlon Brando.

1384
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:12,660
This is in German.

1385
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,900
They're going to do a diet to drink sewage and weeds.

1386
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,460
The director actually went crazy.

1387
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,500
It's a really interesting movie.

1388
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,220
But don't worry, your tampons will be free.

1389
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,340
He actually said that, too.

1390
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,660
I mean, yes.

1391
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:29,100
So that's Goldfinger.

1392
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,940
He's more of a corrupt industrialist.

1393
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:34,700
Pull up Adam Spector in From Russia With Love.

1394
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,980
I'll never even show his face.

1395
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,500
But just pull up James Bond.

1396
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,620
Pull up Dr. Evil.

1397
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,020
I got to digress here.

1398
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,740
If you don't fund our operation, if you

1399
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,460
don't do your Christmas shopping with us,

1400
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,740
we're not funded by Paul Schwab.

1401
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:53,620
Certainly, if you want more content like this,

1402
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,420
please give us money.

1403
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,500
All right, we have breaking news.

1404
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:00,980
Hold on.

1405
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:01,500
Hold on.

1406
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,500
That guy looks a little bit like Blofeld.

1407
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,980
Can we pull up some Blofeld?

1408
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,260
Yeah, I know I'm Wolf Plisser.

1409
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,700
Can we pull up Blofeld?

1410
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,020
Sure, it's breaking news.

1411
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,180
Pull up Blofeld!

1412
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,220
My enemies look like James Bond villains.

1413
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,220
Not that one.

1414
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:17,860
The other one.

1415
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,380
The other one.

1416
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,460
Let's get a picture of it.

1417
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,180
What about Mini-Me?

1418
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:21,660
No.

1419
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,180
You will eat sewage.

1420
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,300
They look like Dr. Evil.

1421
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:24,660
You know what?

1422
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,860
Just pull up Dr. Evil.

1423
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:26,540
That makes sense.

1424
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:30,180
I'm doing this great impression of sewage man.

1425
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,180
Look, we need your money.

1426
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:31,700
Well.

1427
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,820
So that was bad.

1428
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:39,420
I was like, oh, that's just a tragic ad pivot.

1429
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,620
But then it gets even worse.

1430
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,820
Because Alex is talking about this prostiguard

1431
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:43,780
that's back in stock.

1432
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,180
Sure.

1433
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,580
I think he might be fucking around

1434
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,940
and getting himself sued again.

1435
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,340
Good.

1436
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,580
And the Saw Palmetto is great for women, too.

1437
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:54,060
It's just been found that the FDA has had to admit that, OK,

1438
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:56,460
medical doctors should prescribe Saw Palmetto

1439
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,620
as a regular daily regimen for your prostate.

1440
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:01,500
Because it literally just basically 99% chance

1441
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,740
it stops the cancer.

1442
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:03,420
Depending on the study, you look like it's very high numbers.

1443
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,700
Wait, what did you just say?

1444
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,580
What did you just say?

1445
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:05,900
Well, I'm not advertising it.

1446
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,380
Hold up.

1447
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:10,660
I'm advertising it as essential vitamin and minerals for you.

1448
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,420
Sir, excuse me.

1449
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,420
So what's great about that is that part at the end where

1450
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,740
he's like, I'm not advertising it as that.

1451
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:15,100
No.

1452
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:15,620
No, no, no.

1453
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,100
I am mentioning that in the middle of a sales pitch.

1454
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,620
Well, there's that.

1455
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:24,580
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1456
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,620
99% chance you won't get prostate cancer

1457
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,660
if you take Saw Palmetto.

1458
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,620
Wow.

1459
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,180
And is it a legal defense whenever they're like, OK,

1460
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:34,940
well, you said this.

1461
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,180
And he's like, no, no, no, no.

1462
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,460
I put JK at the end.

1463
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,620
See?

1464
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,300
I don't know.

1465
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,300
I think that's illegal.

1466
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:40,700
Yeah.

1467
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:44,180
Anyway, Alex starts talking about Biden, right?

1468
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:44,700
Mm-hmm.

1469
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,980
He doesn't have to worry about Biden.

1470
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,500
OK, good.

1471
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,220
Because what you really have to worry about is Kamala Harris.

1472
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:49,540
OK.

1473
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,260
Because she's actually going to be the president.

1474
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,460
I thought it was because she's a woman

1475
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,140
and they're far more threatened by women,

1476
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:57,020
especially a woman of color than they are of white men.

1477
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:00,260
I think that if you really got granular with it

1478
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,540
and you got Alex into a psychiatrist's office,

1479
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,580
psychologist's office, maybe this is something

1480
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,420
that you could tease out eventually.

1481
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,060
Right.

1482
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,620
But no, on the surface, it's because Biden is just

1483
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,740
going to let Kamala be president, basically.

1484
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,380
Oh.

1485
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,140
And he says so much in a clip that Alex plays.

1486
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,060
Since I mentioned it, because it's too insane

1487
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,340
to just say it and not play the clip, where

1488
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,620
he talks about stepping down.

1489
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,740
If he doesn't do what Kamala says, here it is.

1490
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,780
All kidding aside.

1491
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,180
The first lady to be told me she holds them for you.

1492
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,340
Yes, she does.

1493
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:31,860
But not because she and Kamala have become friends.

1494
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,980
But all kidding aside, it's a matter of the thing

1495
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:39,940
we are simpatico on our philosophy of government

1496
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:43,460
and simpatico on how we want to attach, approach these issues

1497
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,500
that we're facing.

1498
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,020
And so I don't have any.

1499
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,340
When we disagree, it'll be just like so far,

1500
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,340
it's been just like Barack and I did.

1501
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,180
It's in private.

1502
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,660
She'll say, I think we should do A, B, C, or D.

1503
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:58,420
And I'll say, I like A, I don't like B and C. And it's OK.

1504
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:01,740
And like I told Barack, if I reach something

1505
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,580
where there's a fundamental disagreement we

1506
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:09,140
have based on a moral principle, I'll

1507
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,700
develop some disease and say I have to resign.

1508
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,140
We don't have that.

1509
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:14,900
We haven't.

1510
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,700
And we discussed at length our views

1511
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,820
on foreign policy, on domestic policy, on intelligence.

1512
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,660
And the great thing is she has a background.

1513
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:26,300
Look at these two disingenuous, slimy frogs

1514
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,860
that know they've stolen this.

1515
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:28,860
OK.

1516
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,580
All right.

1517
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:32,420
I don't think that that clip says what Alex thinks it does.

1518
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:33,820
OK, so what we're going to do.

1519
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:37,900
I think he's saying that when he was Obama's vice president,

1520
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,700
they had sort of private disagreements

1521
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,700
over minor issues.

1522
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,060
And if there was a really substantial thing,

1523
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:50,100
that he would gracefully bow out in a way that

1524
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,540
wouldn't cause psychological damage to the country.

1525
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:56,900
That is not saying that if he disagrees with Kamala Harris

1526
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,540
on substantial issues, he'll fake an injury

1527
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,180
and then she'll become president.

1528
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:06,380
When I was vice president and I didn't

1529
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:10,540
have any actual say over what the final decision was,

1530
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,780
I would give my input.

1531
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,820
And if I found the final decision unacceptable,

1532
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,420
I would not throw a tantrum.

1533
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,660
I would be like, I can't do this.

1534
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,580
I broke my foot.

1535
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,900
I'm no longer vice president.

1536
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,900
That's what he's saying.

1537
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:27,740
Yeah, he's, I find that to be an incredibly mature position.

1538
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:32,540
That like, yeah, I would assume that what

1539
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:36,500
is being discussed there, if you want

1540
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,460
to apply it to the president, it would be Harris will step down

1541
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:45,260
if there is a fundamental disagreement between them.

1542
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:47,340
That's pretty much what he's saying.

1543
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,300
If we were, because he wasn't president before.

1544
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:56,700
So his story isn't based on when he was president.

1545
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,540
What a dick.

1546
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:58,100
Yep.

1547
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:03,100
Speaking of dicks, somebody who's a real pile of shit,

1548
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,780
somebody who's, I can't stand, his voice is so annoying.

1549
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:10,420
Oh god, Tom Papert, the National File is back.

1550
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,580
And he's pitching this conspiracy

1551
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,900
where this woman and her daughter in Georgia

1552
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:20,580
were like, you know, they switched ballots and stuff.

1553
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,260
And like, he's going to fuck around and get.

1554
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,460
Like in a Freaky Friday situation,

1555
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,620
it was like a magical evening and they

1556
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,300
touched it in front of a fountain.

1557
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,100
I don't care about what's going on.

1558
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,660
They have not presented evidence that

1559
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,460
rises to any level of suspicion.

1560
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,020
There's that.

1561
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,580
It is just like, I'm only going to play this clip

1562
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,740
because these dudes are trying to get people killed.

1563
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:39,340
Yeah.

1564
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,140
You see the four or five people in the video

1565
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:44,060
and everybody's wondering, well, who the heck are these people?

1566
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:46,380
Well, now we know, thanks to the very good reporting

1567
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,460
of the Gateway Pundit, it's the mother, a woman named

1568
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,380
Ruby Freeman, and her daughter.

1569
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:54,060
Her daughter, she says in a Facebook video,

1570
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:57,340
is her supervisor while she works on the election.

1571
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,180
She talks about people complaining

1572
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,340
because her supervisor is giving out

1573
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,340
instructions that don't make sense

1574
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,820
and seem to be against the law.

1575
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,500
She says, well, that's just how it is.

1576
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,340
That's my supervisor.

1577
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,220
She makes it very clear that her daughter is calling the shots.

1578
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,380
Well, Alex, her daughter happens to have long blonde dreadlocks

1579
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:18,980
that in a grainy security camera look a lot like braids.

1580
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,900
Her daughter is the woman who at 8.22 in the morning

1581
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,580
on election day brought in these suitcases full of ballots.

1582
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:29,380
And then once everybody was gone because of the leaky toilets

1583
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,340
on that night, she is the one who

1584
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:34,020
started removing the suitcases from underneath the table

1585
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,300
and counting them and ordering the other people to count them.

1586
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,500
This is an elaborate conspiracy that he is directly

1587
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,540
accusing people of.

1588
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,660
And by name.

1589
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:48,380
Yeah, and by name, I think that if these two people,

1590
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,660
this mother and daughter, feel so inclined,

1591
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:53,020
I think they should probably sue Tom Papert.

1592
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,220
This is outrageous.

1593
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:54,940
100%.

1594
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,660
Because of the consequences.

1595
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,300
I mean, granted, it'd probably take a lot of time.

1596
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:02,380
It would be unnecessarily difficult and a pain

1597
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,300
in the ass.

1598
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,300
But the potential consequences of the actions

1599
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,780
that people like Alex and Tom are doing right here

1600
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:12,460
are so severe that they deserve some sort

1601
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,020
of a consequence for it.

1602
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:17,900
And I just can't believe they would do this kind of thing

1603
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,540
to people.

1604
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,140
I can.

1605
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:19,940
Yeah, I guess I can.

1606
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:23,780
I mean, they just have such a bloodlust.

1607
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,900
They just really do.

1608
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,140
Like a literal, like, not only are we

1609
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,700
saying this person's name hoping they get death threats,

1610
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:34,140
like, this is what we want.

1611
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:37,100
And it's just so fucked.

1612
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,500
Yeah, it's tough.

1613
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,340
Oh, there's that stranger over there

1614
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:43,140
who I'm going to exploit and maybe get killed.

1615
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:43,820
The end.

1616
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:48,220
So anyway, Tom is on with, he's much rosier than Alex

1617
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,180
in a lot of ways.

1618
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,900
He's basically convinced that Trump

1619
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,460
is going to win these cases, and then he's

1620
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,900
going to become president again.

1621
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,140
So really what I should have said upfront when you came on,

1622
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,860
the big news is not just all the smoking gun evidence now,

1623
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,820
but also the legislatures are starting

1624
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,900
to move in the right direction.

1625
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:04,940
That's exactly right.

1626
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:08,220
And these people, Alex, these are the modern revolutionaries.

1627
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,140
These are the new founding fathers.

1628
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,740
These legislatures, the state legislatures

1629
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,220
are the new founding fathers of a new country that's

1630
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,540
going to be under Trump.

1631
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,020
Now, admittedly, many of these state legislatures

1632
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,780
have also been in agreement with the whole lockdown and COVID

1633
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:23,260
stuff.

1634
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,100
And so after this one, we're going

1635
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,940
to go back to tearing down their homes.

1636
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:32,900
But for now, get into Trump, and then we'll fuck you up.

1637
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:33,580
Yeah.

1638
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,060
I mean, there is no loyalty.

1639
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,100
There's no consistency.

1640
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:40,260
And it's never more clearly embodied

1641
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,780
than when they start talking about Attorney General William

1642
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,860
Barr.

1643
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,660
As we know, he was someone who was not

1644
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,980
to be trusted at the beginning.

1645
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,300
Ooh, bad.

1646
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,500
Because he was associated with the Bushes.

1647
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,700
H.W. Bush pardoned all those people.

1648
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,580
Uh-huh.

1649
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:59,220
And then he started to get real creepy and super accommodating

1650
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:00,340
of some of Trump's BS.

1651
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,420
Yeah, because he's a hero.

1652
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,220
And then, yeah, he became a hero.

1653
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,940
He's one of the good guys.

1654
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,780
And then he got out of pocket a little bit,

1655
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,300
did some stuff that Alex didn't like.

1656
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,660
I always knew he was a monster.

1657
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,160
Yeah.

1658
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,940
And then he said some really, really fucked up stuff.

1659
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,020
That's because he's a hero.

1660
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:14,700
Right.

1661
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,060
And so now he's a villain again.

1662
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:16,860
Oh, he's a monster.

1663
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,940
Barr coming out was a reserve army.

1664
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,260
We know he's been a deep state double agent at least.

1665
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,700
But the fact that he came out against Trump a few days ago

1666
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,340
showed their total desperation.

1667
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:30,380
That was their emergency get out of jail free card

1668
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,060
and ain't working.

1669
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:34,100
Well, that's exactly right.

1670
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,140
I mean, you described Barr perfectly there.

1671
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,380
I've never quite thought about it that way.

1672
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,180
But that's correct.

1673
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,380
I mean, Barr's father hired Jeffrey Epstein

1674
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,580
to teach at a girls' school when nobody else would.

1675
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,060
That's who Barr's family is.

1676
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,660
So it makes perfect sense that he's

1677
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,900
in the sleeper with a significant amount of Trump

1678
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,180
supporters saying, oh, he plays the bagpipes.

1679
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:50,900
I love him.

1680
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,300
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1681
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,180
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1682
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:57,940
I mean, like the tone of his voice, I can't stand it.

1683
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:58,740
No, it's terrible.

1684
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,060
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1685
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:01,740
It's morning radio-y.

1686
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,180
It's just obnoxious.

1687
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,020
It's terrible.

1688
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:04,500
Yeah.

1689
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,620
I almost said bingo because that is something that you literally

1690
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,220
said that to me last week.

1691
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:12,880
I wonder how long it's going to take for him to remember

1692
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,820
the Epstein stuff.

1693
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:14,300
Yeah.

1694
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,380
Exactly this long.

1695
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,740
The second I read the headline that Barr

1696
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:21,220
said that there wasn't evidence of widespread voter fraud,

1697
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:23,220
I texted you, well, looks like Alex

1698
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,460
is about to remember that Barr's a villain again.

1699
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,340
Yep, yep.

1700
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,660
It's just so sad.

1701
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,180
It's predictable as shit.

1702
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:29,820
Yeah.

1703
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:33,620
So in this next clip, Tom has broken the case

1704
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:37,580
on what's going on with voting.

1705
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:38,420
And I think he does.

1706
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,680
Tom has broken the case.

1707
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,980
I think he doesn't know how voting works.

1708
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,020
I agree.

1709
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,600
And I have a potential idea of how this may have

1710
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,620
happened after examining Georgia.

1711
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:49,420
So I talked to an election expert last night

1712
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,860
who testified yesterday.

1713
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,820
He said that what they found is they're

1714
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,500
using homeless shelters in downtown Atlanta

1715
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,660
and other Democrat strongholds to register thousands of people.

1716
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:02,260
And mental institutions and nursing homes.

1717
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,980
Which, by the way, seems to be a thing that experts have not

1718
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,100
weighed in, meaning the lawyers.

1719
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,640
But that seems to be a clear and obvious violation of the law.

1720
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,020
You cannot have 2,000 people like Alex.

1721
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:12,780
You can't just walk into a homeless shelter

1722
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,100
and say, I'm here to register to vote.

1723
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,500
I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous.

1724
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,060
Yes, you can.

1725
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,860
So I think these people have been older than we have.

1726
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:18,740
I mean, we know that.

1727
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:21,700
And it's a literal legal thing that you can do.

1728
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,060
Does he think that people experiencing homelessness

1729
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:24,620
can't vote?

1730
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,700
They don't get to vote because they don't have homes.

1731
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,780
Does he think that people without permanent addresses

1732
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:29,460
can't vote?

1733
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:30,420
They don't own property.

1734
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,860
Only property holding white men are allowed to vote, Dan.

1735
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:33,700
Didn't you know that?

1736
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,700
Do you think that people in residential care can't vote?

1737
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,240
Like Alex is saying they're registering

1738
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,380
people in nursing homes.

1739
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,260
Yeah.

1740
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,140
You know those people have a right to vote.

1741
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:43,460
Since when?

1742
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,140
Always.

1743
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,660
Oh.

1744
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,580
Why you?

1745
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,500
I mean, obviously.

1746
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,420
I think it's a little transparent, but.

1747
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:53,420
It's a little bit like.

1748
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,540
It's remarkable the sort of the lack of grasp

1749
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,900
on any kind of civics there.

1750
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:58,860
Like just, oh, yeah.

1751
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:01,020
Oh, yeah, obviously, if you're experiencing homelessness,

1752
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:02,060
you can't vote.

1753
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:02,980
Oh, yeah, you saw.

1754
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:06,340
Why would you let those people vote?

1755
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:07,660
That's how they think.

1756
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:09,220
That is exactly how they think.

1757
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:09,780
Yep.

1758
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:13,620
So Tom leaves, and Alex has a big piece

1759
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:17,500
of news about social media, big tech.

1760
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,580
Oh, is he getting back on?

1761
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:19,600
No.

1762
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:24,500
There's another really big story that I haven't gotten to,

1763
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:28,180
and I really, really need to get to it.

1764
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:31,260
And it deals with the next level that

1765
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:35,980
is now here of censorship.

1766
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:38,260
And it deals with YouTube saying they're

1767
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:42,940
going to, quote, suppress the videos of white males

1768
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:44,620
and not let them trend.

1769
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:45,460
Wow.

1770
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:46,740
Wow, indeed.

1771
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:47,780
That is a huge wow.

1772
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,820
I would imagine if they came out and said that,

1773
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,820
there would be a large outcry.

1774
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,020
So since he's saying that they did say that,

1775
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,660
and I haven't heard about it, I suppose

1776
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:58,020
they're suppressing the news of their suppression?

1777
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:58,820
That might be.

1778
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:01,140
That might be it, because Alex is dead serious.

1779
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:01,980
OK.

1780
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,820
They're going to discriminate because someone

1781
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:07,340
has white skin and is male.

1782
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:10,900
So now, just because you're white,

1783
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,420
you're not going to be able to trend.

1784
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,620
Quote Martin Luther King Jr. Do it.

1785
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:16,260
I fucking dare you.

1786
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,980
By the way, I'm not joking.

1787
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:22,220
It actually says, we will suppress white males.

1788
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:24,180
Ladies and gentlemen, what is that meant to do?

1789
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:26,380
It's meant to create total racial division.

1790
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,540
So I found the article about this on Infowars,

1791
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:31,140
and it's just about YouTube responding to their creators,

1792
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,640
who have noted that there seems to be

1793
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,060
a bias in the algorithmic boosting of videos

1794
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,100
and channels of white creators.

1795
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,460
In response, they ask creators to voluntarily provide

1796
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,260
information about their identity, which

1797
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:44,340
could be used to help better track and see

1798
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:47,540
if there is an actual underlying bias in their algorithm

1799
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,060
that they can find a way to mitigate.

1800
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:49,540
Sure.

1801
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:52,460
As it stands now, there's really no way for them to test that,

1802
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,940
because they have no data on the identities of the creators.

1803
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,500
So this would be a way that they could

1804
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,860
try to solve that problem that their users have

1805
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,780
requested they look into.

1806
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:03,100
Alex is just making up all the details of the story,

1807
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,620
including that quote about not letting white males trend.

1808
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:05,940
Yeah.

1809
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:08,020
This is all just him trying to scare his audience,

1810
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:10,420
because they're super into white identity fear.

1811
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:11,700
Hey, YouTube.

1812
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,740
A lot of white dudes.

1813
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:13,740
Look into it.

1814
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:14,540
OK.

1815
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:20,820
So I just find this to be sad.

1816
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:21,620
Yeah.

1817
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:22,140
Yeah.

1818
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,980
It's not.

1819
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:27,140
White men really going hard now, but they're

1820
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:30,260
so desperate with their bullshit, it's real pathetic.

1821
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:32,400
Well, the problem that I have is that this

1822
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,740
is so easy to understand what the actual story is

1823
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:38,500
on YouTube's side of things.

1824
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,660
And Alex seems like he should have bigger issues right now.

1825
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,860
Like, there's this whole election fraud thing.

1826
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:47,060
There's the vaccines and the COVID and all this.

1827
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:51,180
Do you really need to try and stoke white fear out of the end?

1828
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:52,780
And the answer is yes.

1829
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:53,260
Yeah.

1830
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,820
Because that's his bread and butter.

1831
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:55,460
Sure.

1832
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:58,260
That's something that's so important to keeping

1833
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:02,140
the audience engaged, keeping them interested.

1834
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:05,740
It is interesting that you can hammer one story.

1835
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:08,380
You can hit, oh, voter fraud, voter fraud, voter fraud,

1836
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:09,700
voter fraud, voter fraud.

1837
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,340
But with white identity stuff, you've

1838
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,700
always got to provide more and more new examples each time.

1839
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,020
Otherwise, people are like, wow, that's the only reason

1840
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:18,700
they're, or that's the only thing they're

1841
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,300
oppressing white men about.

1842
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:23,180
You have to make up some new bullshit all the time.

1843
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:25,340
Yeah, and just misrepresent all sorts of shit.

1844
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:26,020
Yep.

1845
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:27,980
So Alex doesn't want to kill people,

1846
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,780
although he has said that he's killed people

1847
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:30,660
a bunch in the past.

1848
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:31,540
And that he liked it.

1849
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:32,460
Yeah.

1850
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:36,780
And look, I don't want to start going around and killing

1851
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,380
people, OK?

1852
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,860
But I'm just telling everybody something.

1853
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,220
We have a duty to not put up with this

1854
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:45,340
and to get in these people's faces and say, look,

1855
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:46,860
you may think there's too many people.

1856
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,340
And in some areas, there probably are.

1857
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,460
And there's some problems.

1858
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,340
But man, come on.

1859
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:50,740
Wait, what?

1860
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,540
He's talking about the vaccine because he

1861
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:53,860
thinks it's a depopulation thing.

1862
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:54,900
Oh, I got you.

1863
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,260
So he doesn't want to go around and kill people,

1864
01:05:57,260 --> 01:06:00,660
but they're going to have a vaccine, right?

1865
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:03,500
So much like Joe Rogan explaining bedtime

1866
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,700
to his child, you are meant to go to globalists

1867
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,580
and say, hey, look, I know you think there are too many

1868
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:13,220
people, but how about don't kill them?

1869
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:17,140
I guess in this example, Alex is going to kill his kid

1870
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,140
if he doesn't go to bed.

1871
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,420
It does seem like he's going to walk around killing children

1872
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,700
who don't do what he says.

1873
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:25,260
Yeah, he'll become a legend of folklore, the guy who

1874
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,700
kills you if you don't go to bed.

1875
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:30,140
You'll be used to terrified children for generations.

1876
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:33,500
Into your mirror three times.

1877
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,300
Oh, boy.

1878
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:40,060
So Alex, there's some talk from these ex-presidents

1879
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:42,220
about how they're going to take that vaccine on TV.

1880
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,420
Which I think is stupid.

1881
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,340
Well, I think it's perfunctory.

1882
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:46,780
I think it's what you have to do.

1883
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:50,500
But Alex, of course, has a rebuttal all ready to go.

1884
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,620
Bill Clinton says, I'm going to take a vaccine.

1885
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,180
I'll do it on TV.

1886
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:59,540
If you believe they're going to take an mRNA vaccine that

1887
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:04,060
reprograms every cell in your body, I mean,

1888
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:04,940
this is their move.

1889
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:06,620
I mean, they're not just going to sterilize you.

1890
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:07,220
You know that.

1891
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:08,020
You're dead.

1892
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:10,860
So I mean, obviously, it's going to be if they do get it,

1893
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,980
it'll be that's not really the vaccine.

1894
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:13,660
It's a fake.

1895
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:17,020
It's like a placebo vaccine.

1896
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,180
The moment they said that, I was like, what the fuck

1897
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:19,860
are we doing?

1898
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:20,860
It's not the real one.

1899
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:24,140
Part of me even believes you get some sort of super rich guy

1900
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:24,940
vaccine.

1901
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:27,780
Don't think they're going to trust you guys.

1902
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:34,340
I just think that not doing that is wrong.

1903
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:35,060
Probably.

1904
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:39,900
Because there is something about the communal experience

1905
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:44,180
and seeing these people partake in something very basic

1906
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:47,180
that we all are in.

1907
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:52,420
There's something unifying to high profile people being like,

1908
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,060
yeah, I'm getting a shot too.

1909
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:56,500
In the same way that if you were a kid,

1910
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,020
your parent might get a shot.

1911
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:58,500
Totally.

1912
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,220
It doesn't hurt.

1913
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:00,300
It's fine.

1914
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:00,860
Yeah.

1915
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,900
We're bonding over this.

1916
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:04,540
I think that there's something healthy

1917
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,220
when our leaders do that.

1918
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:08,060
And so I'm not opposed to it.

1919
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:09,740
I'm not opposed to it for sure.

1920
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:14,940
But pretending that it has any impact on people who are down

1921
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,500
these roads is nonsense.

1922
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:20,340
Yeah, the people who hate the three of you the most

1923
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:22,940
are going to be like, well, if they're getting the vaccine

1924
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:26,300
that I totally believe is the same vaccine that poor people

1925
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:26,900
would get.

1926
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:27,420
Yeah.

1927
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:27,940
Jesus.

1928
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:28,620
Yeah.

1929
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:31,220
So Alex went to a protest the night

1930
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,460
before this on the evening of the 3rd

1931
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:36,580
against Governor Abbott or something, maybe the mayor.

1932
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,780
I think it's actually the mayor.

1933
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:42,060
But in this next clip, Alex admits to assaulting someone.

1934
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:42,700
Hey.

1935
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,500
Last night, I decided, because other people were down

1936
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,260
there protesting the day before, to go down

1937
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:49,900
to protest Mayor Adler, who is on a private jet, big parties,

1938
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:51,900
not wearing masks, but saying our businesses should

1939
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:52,780
be shut down.

1940
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:55,660
The guy was yelling at me and threatening me, going, hey,

1941
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:56,820
why don't you come down here?

1942
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:58,940
So I just went down there and got his face a little.

1943
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:00,380
And I probably shouldn't have pulled out his mask.

1944
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,900
But I got a little emotional because he was taunting us.

1945
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,660
But I probably shouldn't have assaulted him,

1946
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:06,580
but he was taunting us.

1947
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:08,780
Ugh, yeah.

1948
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:12,620
I probably shouldn't have threatened his life

1949
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:13,660
by removing his mask.

1950
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:17,860
Hey, if you're the person who Alex pulled on his mask,

1951
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:18,940
feel free to sue him.

1952
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:19,420
Yep.

1953
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,580
He has admitted on air that he assaulted you.

1954
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,580
He did it.

1955
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:23,260
No doubt.

1956
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,580
He pulled your mask.

1957
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:25,100
Yep.

1958
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:25,820
The end.

1959
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:26,740
He has confessed.

1960
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,860
Open and shut case.

1961
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:31,980
So in this next clip, Alex confesses to something else.

1962
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:33,980
And that is that he is very stupid

1963
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:36,340
and a big old Islamophobe.

1964
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:39,660
UK police patrolling pubs, throwing out customers

1965
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:42,740
for eating scotched eggs.

1966
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,380
That's right, no drinking allowed.

1967
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:47,060
And if we catch you, even with an egg that

1968
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:50,580
has flavoring of whiskey, we're arresting you, yes.

1969
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:52,260
But the Muslims can run sex rings

1970
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:53,900
with your kidnapped daughters, it's fine.

1971
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:54,820
Whoa.

1972
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:57,460
So scotch eggs aren't whiskey flavored.

1973
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:03,860
That escalated from local cuisine very quickly.

1974
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:05,220
They're not whiskey eggs.

1975
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:07,780
No, I was going to say, does he not know what a scotch egg is?

1976
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:09,460
No, he clearly doesn't.

1977
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:12,260
It's an egg wrapped in sausage and then covered in breadcrumbs.

1978
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:15,340
There was a part of me that, like, I immediately went,

1979
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:16,420
that's not a scotch egg.

1980
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,260
And then I had to question myself, like,

1981
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:21,140
did I not know there was, no, of course there is.

1982
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:23,900
What's going on here is that in an area of the UK

1983
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,380
where this restaurant in question was located,

1984
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,860
the government had put in place rules

1985
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:31,940
that bars can't serve alcohol unless it's part of them

1986
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,620
operating as a restaurant.

1987
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:35,020
Right, you have to go to bed.

1988
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,340
That is to say that bars and pubs without food

1989
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,940
are not allowed to be open.

1990
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:41,020
There was a screenshot of a receipt from a London

1991
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:43,860
restaurant called the Refinery New Street that

1992
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:47,940
showed a bill for 63 Peronys, 12 glasses of Prosecco,

1993
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,700
and one scotch egg.

1994
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:51,420
This was being circulated to imply

1995
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,460
that this is how they're going to get

1996
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,460
around the COVID restrictions.

1997
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,220
In reality, the receipt is cropped

1998
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:58,780
to make it appear that the group only ordered one scotch egg,

1999
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:00,460
but they'd also ordered a ton more food,

2000
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,740
according to the restaurant.

2001
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:03,340
This is just a social media meme.

2002
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:04,820
It's such bullshit.

2003
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:07,340
None of the stuff that Alex is reporting on here is real.

2004
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:09,780
He's just misunderstanding a headline of a story

2005
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:13,460
that he hasn't read, making up what he thinks scotch eggs are,

2006
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:15,300
and using it to throw around completely

2007
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,260
unnecessary Islamophobia.

2008
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:19,420
This is what he does as a career.

2009
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:22,020
He's an idiot who refuses to do any preparation

2010
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:25,020
or any work and just spreads hate all over the place,

2011
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:27,220
because it's all he can do.

2012
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,100
He's useless.

2013
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,420
Social media is the fucking devil.

2014
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,580
We should just get rid of it.

2015
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:34,940
We should only live in communities of 150 or less.

2016
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:36,940
Everybody owns their own business.

2017
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:38,340
I've remade the entire global economy.

2018
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,060
I saw this.

2019
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:39,980
I solved it.

2020
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:41,780
I saw this picture of the receipt,

2021
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:43,780
and I thought, like, ah, that's fun.

2022
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:45,940
It's very obviously cropped, because it

2023
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:47,380
doesn't have a total or anything.

2024
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:48,620
Oh, well, that fucking dicks.

2025
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,380
The receipt is cut off right under the.

2026
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:52,100
How do you not get off?

2027
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,820
Yeah, but it's like, ah, that's fun,

2028
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:55,060
because that is a lot of booze.

2029
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,060
That is a lot of booze.

2030
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:58,540
Yeah.

2031
01:11:58,540 --> 01:11:59,620
Yeah, I don't know.

2032
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,580
I would say Alex should try a little harder.

2033
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:02,740
Yeah.

2034
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:03,700
So in this next clip.

2035
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:05,140
Social media internet.

2036
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:06,140
Perhaps.

2037
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:08,220
So in this next clip, Alex claims

2038
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:11,980
that he's known what's going to happen, all this stuff that's

2039
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:12,900
happening around us.

2040
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,820
He's known it all for 10 years.

2041
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:17,220
And he's been totally consistent on all of this.

2042
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:18,300
Absolutely.

2043
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,300
I told you lockdown's coming years ago.

2044
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,980
Using a virus as the pretext to bring in martial law,

2045
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:26,220
forced inoculation, and digital tracking systems on your phones.

2046
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,900
People are like, how did Jones know it?

2047
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:31,060
They said they'd do it in Operation Lockstep 10 years

2048
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:31,980
ago.

2049
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,460
Didn't exist 10 years ago.

2050
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:34,660
That's what's so frustrating.

2051
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:35,540
It doesn't exist now.

2052
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:37,820
I'm just here like I'm going to play, and they go, oh,

2053
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,100
the next page is there.

2054
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,620
Romeo and Juliet commits suicide.

2055
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:41,900
Oh, the next page is the.

2056
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,340
And I'm just like, OK, now they're going to do this.

2057
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,140
Now they're going to do that.

2058
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,660
I mean, they're going to kill you.

2059
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:49,780
Operation Lockstep isn't a real thing.

2060
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:52,220
Alex didn't know about it.

2061
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:55,700
Everything is such horseshit.

2062
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,060
Right before the 2016 election, Alex

2063
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,860
wasn't making his audience scared

2064
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:02,820
about a virus that was going to bring in martial law

2065
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,180
and tracking and all this.

2066
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:06,380
He said that Obama was going to declare himself

2067
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:08,020
the king of Muslim elimination.

2068
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:08,940
He did.

2069
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:09,860
There was that.

2070
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:10,580
That was his.

2071
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:11,340
There was that.

2072
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,580
There was none of this shit.

2073
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:14,740
Stevie P said he was waiting for the government

2074
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:17,340
to collapse so he could make everybody Dukes.

2075
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,500
No, that was Larry Nichols.

2076
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,260
Oh, that was Nichols.

2077
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:19,860
That's right.

2078
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:21,460
That's right.

2079
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:23,220
No, you don't get to play this card.

2080
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:24,500
You don't get to pretend that.

2081
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,380
It's ludicrous.

2082
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:28,300
Dan, are we broadcasting from the rubble

2083
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:30,620
of a nuclear explosion in Chicago?

2084
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:32,580
I mean, according to Alex's predictions, yes.

2085
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,340
See, that's kind of what I was thinking.

2086
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:35,980
If he's been right about everything.

2087
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:36,700
No.

2088
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,380
This is the shell game that you get

2089
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,140
to play when you're someone like Alex and your audience

2090
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:42,900
has just decided to give up.

2091
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,540
Much like you when you don't have the cliff you want to play.

2092
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:47,260
Our only option is to give up and believe you're bold.

2093
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,740
Once you've been browbeaten to the point of, like,

2094
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:52,660
accepting Alex as a reasonable person,

2095
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:55,260
you just think like, oh yeah, he has always

2096
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:57,460
been saying that they'd use a virus to bring

2097
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:58,940
in the world government.

2098
01:13:58,940 --> 01:13:59,980
No, he hasn't.

2099
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:02,980
If I believe the shit he's saying about now,

2100
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:06,540
why wouldn't I believe him when he says now

2101
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:08,100
that he said it earlier?

2102
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:08,940
Right.

2103
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:13,300
And this actually gets to one of the reasons why, I mean, even

2104
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,500
like, if I were Joe Rogan, I would just

2105
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,020
be personally offended by the way Alex has treated me.

2106
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:18,820
Yeah.

2107
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:21,540
And I would, just as a matter of self-respect,

2108
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,020
I wouldn't hang out with him.

2109
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:24,860
But if you want to take it a step

2110
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:28,620
farther and discuss what the real issues are,

2111
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:32,660
when Alex was on Rogan's podcast last with Tim Dillon,

2112
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:36,900
when they had that episode and Alex was one step away

2113
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:41,180
from being exposed as having made up Operation Lockstep,

2114
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:44,060
the way that they dropped the ball there.

2115
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,820
And again, like I said, not their fault.

2116
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:46,780
They didn't know what the deal was.

2117
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:47,700
They never had a chance.

2118
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:48,500
Right.

2119
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:52,300
But because they didn't, that means Alex wins that point.

2120
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,100
Yep.

2121
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,300
Because of that, because Alex didn't get exposed in front

2122
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:00,380
of millions of people as having made up this Rockefeller plan

2123
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:03,260
that now he's claiming he's known about for 10 years,

2124
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:05,020
he gets to play games like this.

2125
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:10,380
And you have done, at least by virtue of your inability

2126
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:14,020
to stand up to the claim, you've helped solidify it.

2127
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:16,580
You've helped reinforce and make it look like.

2128
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:20,500
And the fact that, like, here's what I'm more offended by.

2129
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,700
What's that?

2130
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:26,780
Rogan had every opportunity after that podcast to find out

2131
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:29,940
if Alex was full of shit and lying to him.

2132
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:33,100
And clearly, he didn't, because he did four hours

2133
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:34,140
in an interview with him.

2134
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:37,820
Yeah, it would suggest he didn't really follow up on stuff.

2135
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:39,140
Yeah, yeah.

2136
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:43,060
And that one's such a big, obvious one.

2137
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,580
The lockstep thing is just so fucking obvious

2138
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,300
if you know what he's talking about.

2139
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,380
It's just disgraceful.

2140
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:51,980
And so this, like I said, personal level,

2141
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:55,940
the way Alex has treated Rogan as a person is disgraceful,

2142
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:57,700
and no one should put up with that.

2143
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:01,500
But societally, it does damage.

2144
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:05,020
Just not being competent at pushing back

2145
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:07,300
against Alex's narratives only serves

2146
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:10,380
to sell your audience to them.

2147
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:14,540
It does seem like with propaganda in those kind of outlets,

2148
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:18,260
there's one chance to win or you lose forever.

2149
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:21,260
Like, once you cede ground on that, it's gone.

2150
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:22,700
It never comes back.

2151
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,540
And if you win, you don't gain the ground.

2152
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:28,700
You just don't lose any, and it's brutal.

2153
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,820
Yeah, and if you put yourself in that situation,

2154
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:33,100
you gotta understand that as the-

2155
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,980
The stakes are high.

2156
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:35,820
Yeah, exactly.

2157
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:37,740
Especially if you've got millions of listeners every,

2158
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:38,580
yeah, yeah, yeah.

2159
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:41,300
It's why if you're somebody who has a platform

2160
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:45,100
and you bring somebody on who's maybe a bad actor,

2161
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,140
you have really high levels of responsibility.

2162
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:48,980
Totally.

2163
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:50,220
If you're somebody who has a show,

2164
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:52,500
you can bring on someone like Richard Spencer

2165
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,820
or Milo Yiannopoulos, but you have a great responsibility

2166
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:58,500
to not allow them to frame everything.

2167
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,340
Yep.

2168
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:00,940
And that is your job.

2169
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:04,580
And the challenge is such that you cannot half-ass it.

2170
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:05,420
Right.

2171
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:09,820
And Rogan, to his unfortunate naivete or whatever,

2172
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:11,500
I don't believe that anymore,

2173
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,260
but he thinks that he's just having a conversation

2174
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:15,580
with friends or whatever.

2175
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:17,580
At least that's what he wants to present.

2176
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:21,100
And because of that, you're never gonna be in a position.

2177
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,580
And that's why he can't have people

2178
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:24,580
like Milo Yiannopoulos on anymore.

2179
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:26,260
He can't have those guests on anymore

2180
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:29,220
because it's too, you can't do that.

2181
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,060
You can't do it.

2182
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:32,860
Yeah, somehow Alex is still fine, but-

2183
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:33,900
I don't know how.

2184
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:34,740
I don't either.

2185
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:35,580
That's what we're doing.

2186
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:37,420
So anyway, we have one last clip here.

2187
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:40,020
And Alex has a guest on named Jennifer Fleck.

2188
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:42,820
And she claimed that she had footage or something

2189
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:44,780
of voter fraud in Austin.

2190
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:45,620
Sure.

2191
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:48,500
Because of course, deep blue areas are only deep blue

2192
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,580
because the Democrats are stealing all the votes.

2193
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:51,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2194
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:52,260
Whatever.

2195
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:53,100
That's the only thing that makes sense.

2196
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:55,580
Right, so she's on and I found this really weird

2197
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:58,220
because she was like, she was running for some office

2198
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:01,820
lost in the GOP primary and then became a poll watcher.

2199
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:03,020
Sure, that's good.

2200
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,820
Got into some kind of a dust up

2201
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:06,620
because she had like recording equipment

2202
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:07,780
and you're not allowed to have that.

2203
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:08,620
Great, great, great.

2204
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:09,460
It's like, all right.

2205
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:10,300
Okay.

2206
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,140
I don't care.

2207
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:13,300
I really don't care about any of this.

2208
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:15,620
Like her voter fraud stories,

2209
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,580
because they're thin and I don't see any evidence of this.

2210
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:19,620
How do we let so many people in politics

2211
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:21,540
who wouldn't be allowed in a bar?

2212
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:23,940
There's a bit, bars have bouncers.

2213
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:26,340
She wouldn't go to a bar because she's very into God

2214
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:28,300
and going to church and all this.

2215
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:31,260
I read that on her ballotpedia Q&A.

2216
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:32,100
Great.

2217
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:35,380
Anyway, I don't care about their interview at all.

2218
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:36,220
Sure.

2219
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:37,340
But I would just like to demonstrate

2220
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,060
what sort of people the two of them are.

2221
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:39,900
Okay.

2222
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:42,540
As they get into some real ableist shithead joking.

2223
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:43,500
Great, great.

2224
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,700
I remember reading the governor's executive order

2225
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,560
this summer and there were like 10 exceptions

2226
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:53,500
to businesses closing or that he had like 10 exceptions.

2227
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,980
And I remember one of them was that

2228
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:58,020
he closed all the rafting businesses.

2229
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:00,440
Like you couldn't, like your rafting businesses

2230
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:01,420
couldn't stay open.

2231
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:04,820
And I thought, how bizarre that he would attack

2232
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:08,500
a small business in Texas and let all these other big-

2233
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,420
Let's just say it, he's a miserable person.

2234
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:12,820
I'm sorry he's a handicap.

2235
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:14,100
He can't go rafting.

2236
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:15,340
He doesn't want you to.

2237
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:16,660
Right?

2238
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:19,700
No, it's because float trips were spreading.

2239
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:23,780
A lot of cases of COVID were happening at float trips.

2240
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:26,500
Do you not remember the Trump float trip

2241
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,340
that spread all the shit?

2242
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:31,540
And float trips in rafts and stuff like that

2243
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:35,880
are just like 20 year olds drunk as fuck in big groups,

2244
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,460
barges going down the river.

2245
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:40,600
Like it's obviously, yeah.

2246
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:43,180
It seems if you've never been on a float trip before

2247
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:44,500
probably might be like-

2248
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,700
It's social distance, you're in a tube.

2249
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,260
You're in a canoe and maybe someone else is in a canoe

2250
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,100
a ways away from you.

2251
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:51,380
That's not always the case.

2252
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:53,020
No, no.

2253
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:55,620
I can see, as someone who's been on a lot of float trips,

2254
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:58,420
I can see why someone would close a rafting business.

2255
01:19:58,420 --> 01:19:59,340
And that's shitty.

2256
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:01,020
That's fucking shitty.

2257
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,420
The way they're acting and being like,

2258
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:06,660
yeah, he's just mad that he can't go rafting.

2259
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:07,900
Fuck you, Alex.

2260
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,380
You loved Greg Abbott

2261
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:11,780
until he didn't do what you wanted him to do.

2262
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:14,900
Yeah, we're in a little bit of a bar situation here.

2263
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:19,580
And now you dare attack him for his disability status.

2264
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:21,300
Go fuck yourself.

2265
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,900
What a piece of shit.

2266
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:25,340
Yep, anytime you are talking about somebody

2267
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:27,100
and then you use A

2268
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:29,980
and then a descriptor that is not human,

2269
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:31,340
then you, you know.

2270
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:33,740
It's like whenever, you know,

2271
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:38,220
when you're listening to Andy Daley and Paul M. Hopkins,

2272
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:40,100
where he was as L. Ron Hubbard,

2273
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:42,780
every time you heard him say like a Japanese,

2274
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:43,620
you're like,

2275
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:47,820
Ooh, that's fucked, gross.

2276
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:52,100
Yeah, that sort of linguistic framing is terrible.

2277
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:52,940
It's dehumanizing.

2278
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:54,980
Yeah, and I resent it.

2279
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:59,660
And I want to say everybody who Alex likes now,

2280
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:01,660
look at how he's treating people

2281
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:05,100
who have behaved in ways that are just slightly outside

2282
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,860
of what he wants them to do.

2283
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:09,180
Look at this, he loved Greg Abbott.

2284
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:11,540
He was one of the best governors in the country.

2285
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:12,580
Maybe the best.

2286
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:15,620
Probably, real great governor, we love him.

2287
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:18,340
Now he's being ableist against him.

2288
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,140
He's attacking him,

2289
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:22,580
not only for like him not being extreme enough,

2290
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:24,780
but on these really shitty personal grounds

2291
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:27,100
that are bigoted and horrible.

2292
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:30,020
Rogan, when he's doing what he wants him to do,

2293
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:31,500
Alex would be like, he's so brave,

2294
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,180
he's braver than Tucker Carlson.

2295
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:34,980
When he doesn't, he'll bring up your kids

2296
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:36,460
and say he's gonna destroy you.

2297
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:38,900
Cut you in half, bleed you like a pig.

2298
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:42,020
Consider this, this is how Alex operates.

2299
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:45,180
Yeah, I mean, so the thing is,

2300
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:49,260
he exists in this form of unreality that has to be total.

2301
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:52,300
You can't allow a single real thing

2302
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,540
to come into the unreality bubble.

2303
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,380
Otherwise, the whole thing bursts.

2304
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:58,860
So just like if you're seeing your guy,

2305
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:00,420
Barr is doing something different.

2306
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:03,820
Well, now I can't allow that into the bubble.

2307
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:07,180
Well, it's the nuance that you introduce

2308
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:09,020
when you're like, why would Barr,

2309
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:11,820
if he's the kind of shithead I want him to be,

2310
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:16,220
why would he not do this thing that I think he should do?

2311
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:17,780
You can't like...

2312
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:19,100
Well, and not just that,

2313
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:22,900
but you've painted the Democrats as total complete evil.

2314
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:27,220
So any agreement with the Democrats means you're evil.

2315
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:28,060
You must be.

2316
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:29,020
You have to be.

2317
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:31,340
Otherwise, that introduces the possibility

2318
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:33,780
that not all Democrats are evil.

2319
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:34,620
And then everything falls apart.

2320
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:35,780
And then it's done.

2321
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:39,620
Now, I will say that Alex also played a lot

2322
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:44,620
of the Trump's speech, his 49-minute video that he put out.

2323
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,020
Sure, great.

2324
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:48,300
And I don't have a lot of clips of it

2325
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:51,220
because Alex didn't editorialize on it all that much

2326
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:52,940
because it sounds like Alex.

2327
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:53,940
It sounds exactly like Alex.

2328
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:54,780
Yes.

2329
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:55,620
Yeah, it's word for word.

2330
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:56,620
It's scary as shit.

2331
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:57,900
And I want to make a point of this,

2332
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,340
like as we close the episode,

2333
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,060
that like, yep, that was on his show.

2334
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:04,100
And it's scary as hell because Trump just sounds like Alex.

2335
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,540
It's fucking terrifying, full stop.

2336
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:08,580
I don't know what else to say about it.

2337
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:11,580
I hope.

2338
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:14,820
You know, it's so weird to talk to my family now

2339
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:19,820
because it's like before, in the old times, you know,

2340
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:22,260
they could be like, oh, we're just mainstream Republicans.

2341
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,260
We don't talk about that Alex Jones stuff.

2342
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:26,700
And it's like, now you voted for Trump.

2343
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:27,820
This is what he's saying.

2344
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:30,180
You're in my world and you're wrong.

2345
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:31,060
That's it.

2346
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:35,140
So if you want to, you can't argue with me, that's over.

2347
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:35,980
The end.

2348
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:37,980
You believe this shit.

2349
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:38,820
Yeah.

2350
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:39,660
Done.

2351
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:42,420
And the thing that really bummed me out, I guess,

2352
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,420
and it doesn't bum me out, but it felt really weird.

2353
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:48,020
It's like, just because I listened to so much Alex,

2354
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:51,140
when people would say like, Trump sounds like Alex Jones,

2355
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:52,580
like, nah, not quite.

2356
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:54,100
There's some slight differences.

2357
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:54,940
Yeah.

2358
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:58,780
Or it's like, that's not really what Alex's talking point is.

2359
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:00,700
You'd think it is, but that's,

2360
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:03,700
now I listen to the tapes of that

2361
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,460
and I was like, holy shit.

2362
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:06,300
No, Trump-

2363
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,780
This is exactly the same as Alex's.

2364
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:10,820
Trump might as well like play that 90 second clip

2365
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:13,140
and be like, her name is this.

2366
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,300
And it's, I wouldn't be surprised

2367
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:16,820
if he starts doing that soon.

2368
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:18,620
Yeah, it's-

2369
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:19,740
It's crazy.

2370
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:23,100
Well, I mean, I think you just,

2371
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,460
you take the support you got

2372
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:28,620
and when shit's looking real bad like it is,

2373
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:31,220
what you got is Alex and Tom Papert.

2374
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:32,060
Yeah.

2375
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:32,900
Good luck.

2376
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:35,020
I just keep, like the thing that I keep thinking

2377
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:37,660
is just like, be wary, be wary.

2378
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:39,820
Because when these lawsuits and stuff,

2379
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:43,340
he's desperate now that when the lawsuits and stuff stop,

2380
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:47,060
does anybody really believe he's going to be like, well,

2381
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:48,500
guess I lost this one.

2382
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:51,220
You know, when the lawsuits are done-

2383
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:52,060
Yeah.

2384
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:52,900
He's got to do something.

2385
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:53,740
I think he might-

2386
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:54,580
Desperate.

2387
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:55,780
Well, no, I don't know.

2388
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:58,060
Oh, you think he might just give up?

2389
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:58,900
Yeah.

2390
01:24:58,900 --> 01:24:59,740
Well, I mean-

2391
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:00,580
He made a bunch of money.

2392
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:02,020
Well, that's true.

2393
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:04,300
But he's never made, he doesn't make enough money.

2394
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,700
None of these guys ever make,

2395
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,540
I don't know.

2396
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:08,780
Why does Bezos need another $30 billion

2397
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:10,420
as everybody dies around him?

2398
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:11,260
He doesn't need it.

2399
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:12,140
Right, I don't know.

2400
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,180
I don't know in like us war gaming,

2401
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:17,140
what we imagine he's going to do,

2402
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:17,980
like Trump is going to do.

2403
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:18,820
Sure, no, I'm not war gaming.

2404
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,020
I'm just saying be wary.

2405
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:20,860
You know what I mean?

2406
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:21,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2407
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,300
But trying to predict, I've found is a useless use

2408
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:25,140
of my time.

2409
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:25,980
Totally.

2410
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:28,500
But being wary is always wise.

2411
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,900
I think being wary, a lot of people are just thinking

2412
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,100
it's going to go away, and I'm just saying, be wary.

2413
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,140
Head on a swivel.

2414
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:34,980
Yes.

2415
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:35,820
Look around.

2416
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:36,660
Always.

2417
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:37,620
Yeah.

2418
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:38,700
Keep an eye out.

2419
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:42,020
This is not the 79 days of hell,

2420
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:43,980
but it is the 79 days of hm?

2421
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:47,580
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, where are you?

2422
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:48,900
Easy.

2423
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,620
79 days of careful.

2424
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:53,620
Careful, watch out, it's a wild animal

2425
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:56,580
and it's in a corner, just back slowly.

2426
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:58,420
So we will see what happens.

2427
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:59,260
But we'll be back.

2428
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:02,580
And maybe we'll do that Rogan episode sooner than later.

2429
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:07,380
Because it is a four hour like mystery box today.

2430
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:10,460
I did only make it through the first bit of it.

2431
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:13,460
It could be amazing once it gets rolling

2432
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:16,140
or it could be continuing of that,

2433
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:19,060
just walking through fucking knee deep mud.

2434
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:22,260
Yeah, it has to be a disaster or something

2435
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:25,700
to like sink your teeth into because that just,

2436
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:31,180
see one thing I like about smoking weed,

2437
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:32,820
yeah, Joe, we know.

2438
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:33,900
Yeah, it's good.

2439
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:36,700
Yeah, great, great guys, come on now.

2440
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:38,100
So we will be back.

2441
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:39,580
But until then, we have a website.

2442
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:41,540
We do have a website, it's knowledgefight.com.

2443
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:43,060
Yep, we're also on Twitter.

2444
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:44,900
We are on Twitter, it's at Knowledge Underscore Fight

2445
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:45,740
and I go to bed Jordan.

2446
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:46,580
We're also on Facebook.

2447
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:49,140
We are on Facebook, you tell us you're right.

2448
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:50,660
And if you could please find a local charity

2449
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:52,460
or bail fund in your area to help out people

2450
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:53,780
doing God's work right now.

2451
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:54,620
Yeah, we will be back.

2452
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:57,060
But until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX Clark,

2453
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:57,900
I'm Daryl Rundis.

2454
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:59,100
I didn't bring this up earlier,

2455
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,700
but I think it's really funny that at the time

2456
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:03,460
that we started recording this episode,

2457
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:06,540
I don't know if Rudy Giuliani actually has COVID.

2458
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:07,380
Neither do I.

2459
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:09,620
Because the headline is just that Trump said he did.

2463
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:18,260

2465
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:23,580
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

2468
