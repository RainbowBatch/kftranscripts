00:25.040 --> 00:27.360

00:27.360 --> 00:30.000
Shang, we are the bad guys, knowledgefight

00:59.280 --> 01:01.280
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

01:01.280 --> 01:01.760
I'm Jordan

01:01.760 --> 01:03.520
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty

01:03.520 --> 01:05.680
beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:05.680 --> 01:07.040
Oh indeed we are Dan

01:07.040 --> 01:07.360
Jordan

01:07.360 --> 01:09.360
Dan, quick question for ya

01:09.360 --> 01:09.840
Sure, hit me

01:09.840 --> 01:11.280
What's your bright spot this week?

01:11.280 --> 01:16.880
My bright spot today is, so I've not taken part in too much

01:16.880 --> 01:19.760
of like ordering food from places

01:19.760 --> 01:20.560
Sure, sure, sure

01:20.560 --> 01:23.600
I've tried to keep that limited because it's expensive and stuff

01:23.600 --> 01:25.440
and I like to keep things kind of special

01:25.440 --> 01:25.760
Right

01:25.760 --> 01:28.400
But I realized that I hadn't had Taco Bell in a long time

01:28.400 --> 01:31.200
and so I decided to order some Taco Bell delivery

01:32.000 --> 01:32.960
Which is a nice thing

01:32.960 --> 01:34.240
Reliving those comic days

01:34.240 --> 01:37.440
I couldn't imagine that being something you could do

01:37.440 --> 01:38.480
Well I ordered Taco Bell

01:38.480 --> 01:39.680
Oh totally, totally

01:39.680 --> 01:42.960
It's like pizzas delivered, Chinese foods delivered, and that is it

01:42.960 --> 01:43.840
Yep, yep

01:43.840 --> 01:45.680
Um, so that was kind of fun

01:45.680 --> 01:49.280
But I noticed something on the menu that I had never seen before

01:49.280 --> 01:51.920
It was like an aged cheddar chalupa

01:51.920 --> 01:53.040
Okay

01:53.040 --> 01:56.720
And so it was like a chalupa kind of thing, but it had like cheese

01:56.720 --> 01:57.040
Yeah

01:57.040 --> 01:59.040
Like as if, you know, it's like an Asiago cheese crust

01:59.040 --> 02:00.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

02:00.400 --> 02:03.840
I do always like it when the fast food all of a sudden is like

02:03.840 --> 02:06.960
Ah, this is our artisan aged cheese

02:06.960 --> 02:09.440
Very ambitious, very pretentious

02:09.440 --> 02:09.760
Yeah

02:09.760 --> 02:11.760
But I had to try it because, you know, you got to

02:12.320 --> 02:15.200
And it was so good

02:17.200 --> 02:18.320
It was also terrible

02:18.320 --> 02:20.080
Yeah, of course, of course

02:20.080 --> 02:24.480
I got it and was like, oh wow, this crunchiness of the cheese is really complimenting the

02:24.480 --> 02:25.280
I'm like, what am I thinking?

02:25.280 --> 02:26.960
What are you doing? What am I doing here?

02:26.960 --> 02:28.080
It's fucking Taco Bell

02:28.080 --> 02:29.120
Why am I fucking

02:29.120 --> 02:31.200
Highfalutin' ass Taco Bell

02:31.200 --> 02:33.280
Is this the Great British Baking Show? Come on now

02:33.280 --> 02:37.840
Yeah, but I enjoyed it quite a bit and, you know, you got to find the light where it exists

02:37.840 --> 02:39.120
Yeah, that's great, that's great

02:39.120 --> 02:39.680
How about you?

02:39.680 --> 02:44.560
Uh, I won't provide too many spoilers here, but Dan, as you might be aware

02:45.360 --> 02:47.040
I'm a bit of a fan of Star Wars

02:47.040 --> 02:47.200
Yes

02:47.200 --> 02:48.240
Have you heard of Star Wars?

02:48.240 --> 02:48.720
Yes I have

02:48.720 --> 02:50.160
Okay, it's pretty good

02:50.160 --> 02:51.600
That's the one with the Enterprise, right?

02:51.600 --> 02:55.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the one with the Enterprise, the guys that have the uniforms, it's great

02:55.120 --> 02:55.600
It's great

02:55.600 --> 02:56.560
Ferengis

02:56.560 --> 02:58.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, got little things on his head

02:58.400 --> 03:01.840
There's that guy Q who's now ruining our world

03:01.840 --> 03:04.000
Oh no, is that where he came from?

03:04.000 --> 03:04.400
I don't know

03:04.960 --> 03:08.160
So yeah, Mandalorian, huge fan watching it

03:08.160 --> 03:08.960
Baby Yoda

03:08.960 --> 03:10.320
And yes, Baby Yoda

03:10.960 --> 03:12.240
See, I can have conversations

03:12.240 --> 03:13.120
He has a name now

03:13.120 --> 03:13.520
Oh boy

03:13.520 --> 03:14.640
Oh yeah, yeah, trouble

03:15.680 --> 03:16.800
Should I try and guess it?

03:16.800 --> 03:17.920
I think you should

03:17.920 --> 03:20.080
Okay, Pete

03:20.080 --> 03:22.240
No, really close though

03:22.240 --> 03:23.200
Grogu

03:23.200 --> 03:23.920
Grogu

03:23.920 --> 03:24.960
Very close to Pete

03:24.960 --> 03:25.760
Grogu?

03:25.760 --> 03:28.000
Grogu, I know, it's Baby Yoda forever

03:28.000 --> 03:29.040
That's a Star Wars name

03:29.040 --> 03:31.680
Everyone agrees that it's Baby Yoda forever

03:31.680 --> 03:32.240
Right, yeah

03:33.440 --> 03:33.840
Grogu

03:33.840 --> 03:35.680
But, again, no spoilers

03:36.240 --> 03:38.560
Except for the name of Baby Yoda, that's a spoiler

03:38.560 --> 03:42.720
No, that's not a spoiler, you find out, that was last episode

03:42.720 --> 03:43.760
So that was a while back

03:43.760 --> 03:45.520
Okay, it's a spoiler in case you're a week behind

03:45.520 --> 03:47.600
Also, is it a spoiler to know Grogu is his name?

03:47.600 --> 03:50.640
You immediately forget Grogu and you're like, that's Baby Yoda

03:50.640 --> 03:51.120
Yeah, yeah

03:51.120 --> 03:52.640
Yeah, no one cares

03:52.640 --> 03:53.600
Not my Grogu

03:54.800 --> 03:55.280
Hashtag

03:56.560 --> 04:04.480
No, so this episode, most recent one, a character came back who made me extremely,

04:04.480 --> 04:07.920
extremely happy in a very lovely way

04:07.920 --> 04:11.200
The second season has been basically, like, do you remember Fun Dip?

04:11.200 --> 04:15.040
I don't want to be like a dick in case it's right

04:15.040 --> 04:18.560
Uh-huh, but my instinct is to joke that it's Jar Jar Binks

04:18.560 --> 04:19.520
Ooh, no!

04:19.520 --> 04:19.760
Okay

04:19.760 --> 04:20.960
No, no, no

04:20.960 --> 04:21.280
Okay

04:21.280 --> 04:21.920
Beloved is...

04:23.760 --> 04:24.880
He's a great character

04:29.760 --> 04:31.920
No, uh, shit, where was I?

04:31.920 --> 04:33.920
You just broke my conversation

04:33.920 --> 04:36.080
Oh, yeah, the second season has been Fun Dip

04:36.080 --> 04:40.480
You know, it's the sugar stick that you're dipping in more sugar to eat

04:40.480 --> 04:44.720
Like, everything has been junk food and it has been incredible

04:44.720 --> 04:45.680
and I love it so much

04:45.680 --> 04:48.000
That metaphor falls apart because Fun Dip sucks

04:48.000 --> 04:49.120
Yeah, Fun Dip does suck

04:49.120 --> 04:51.040
I mean, it's a sugar overload is my point

04:51.040 --> 04:52.000
But it's all just sugar

04:52.000 --> 04:53.600
Even as a kid, I didn't want any Fun Dip

04:53.600 --> 04:54.880
Oh, I loved Fun Dip

04:54.880 --> 04:55.280
Come on, man

04:55.280 --> 04:56.240
That stick was disgusting

04:56.240 --> 04:58.640
I chewed on that stick like it was my friend

04:58.640 --> 05:01.520
Like it was a milk bone and you were a stray dog

05:01.520 --> 05:02.240
Exactly

05:02.240 --> 05:03.760
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying that

05:03.760 --> 05:04.400
It's delicious

05:04.400 --> 05:11.440
I feel like my plan is, uh, watch The Mandalorian once there's, like, five seasons of it

05:11.440 --> 05:12.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

05:12.000 --> 05:13.200
And I can just watch it all

05:13.200 --> 05:13.680
It's great

05:13.680 --> 05:16.400
Yeah, I have this- I have that relationship with TV shows

05:16.400 --> 05:19.440
Like, I want there to be multiple seasons of it that I can binge

05:19.440 --> 05:22.000
Because if I like it, I don't want to stop watching it

05:22.000 --> 05:26.480
Who was- I know Netflix was the first place to, like, just release the whole thing

05:26.480 --> 05:29.600
Was it, like, Daredevil or something that was the first show where they're like

05:29.600 --> 05:31.920
We're putting all 12 episodes out

05:31.920 --> 05:36.160
And then I've never- I'm no longer able to watch episodic television

05:36.160 --> 05:39.520
Yeah, I- it started earlier than that for me

05:39.520 --> 05:40.080
Yeah

05:40.080 --> 05:41.760
Or at least, like, the challenge of it

05:41.760 --> 05:44.720
And I think it's because I- what I would do is I would come to shows late

05:45.600 --> 05:50.400
Because I don't buy the hype and I don't want to get tricked by, like, people saying

05:50.400 --> 05:51.920
This is the best thing ever

05:51.920 --> 05:53.120
I like that's your relationship

05:53.120 --> 05:53.760
Well, I don't want to get-

05:53.760 --> 05:56.880
I don't want to get tricked by these liars who like stuff

05:56.880 --> 06:00.640
A lot of television is reliant on cliffhanger-y nonsense

06:00.640 --> 06:01.280
Sure, that's true

06:01.280 --> 06:02.640
Especially hour-long dramas

06:02.640 --> 06:03.200
Right, right, right

06:03.200 --> 06:05.200
And so if you're watching it week to week

06:06.080 --> 06:08.880
Like, the experience of that is so much more engrossing

06:08.880 --> 06:11.920
And it can trick you into liking things that you don't actually like all that much

06:11.920 --> 06:12.800
That's true

06:12.800 --> 06:15.200
So I always try and give things a little bit of time

06:15.200 --> 06:16.160
Give it a little space

06:16.160 --> 06:20.720
Yeah, and so, like, Lost I started in, like, season four or something like that

06:20.720 --> 06:26.560
And the experience of watching the prior three seasons, like, all in a row was pretty gratifying

06:26.560 --> 06:29.280
Yeah, I think that happens to a lot of people with, like, The Wire

06:29.280 --> 06:31.600
Where they're like, it takes three episodes to get into it

06:31.600 --> 06:33.840
And I imagine if I started watching episodically

06:33.840 --> 06:36.400
I'd watch the first episode and be like, eh, I'm good

06:36.400 --> 06:36.800
Yeah

06:36.800 --> 06:37.360
You know?

06:37.360 --> 06:40.000
I don't know if you'd say I'm good, but it would be a different experience

06:40.000 --> 06:40.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah

06:40.640 --> 06:41.440
It would be harder

06:42.800 --> 06:43.920
But yeah, anyway

06:44.640 --> 06:46.240
Television, models have changed

06:47.280 --> 06:51.120
Yes, this is us, commentary, cultural, it's amazing

06:51.120 --> 06:53.680
So, Jordan, today we've got an episode to go over

06:53.680 --> 06:56.000
We're going to be talking about December 3rd and 4th, 2020

06:56.000 --> 06:57.120
I'm Dan, this is 2020

06:57.120 --> 06:59.520
Hey! 2020 is great forever now

06:59.520 --> 07:00.020
Yay!

07:01.360 --> 07:04.800
I started listening to the episode with Rogan

07:04.800 --> 07:07.680
Alex's interview, a four-hour long interview with Joe Rogan

07:07.680 --> 07:09.280
Riveting stuff they talked about

07:09.280 --> 07:11.520
They were stoned in the first minute

07:11.520 --> 07:17.440
Just policy, real questions getting into the nitty-gritty of universal basic income

07:17.440 --> 07:22.160
I made it, like, 15 minutes in and I was like, I'll do an episode about this eventually, probably

07:22.160 --> 07:24.880
But, like, it's so annoying

07:24.880 --> 07:25.440
It's so...

07:26.720 --> 07:31.520
To give you some context, like, Alex's first real question he asks is, like,

07:31.520 --> 07:35.200
at what point did you realize that you were, like, really famous,

07:35.200 --> 07:36.960
but you can do whatever you want to do?

07:39.600 --> 07:40.640
That's a great question

07:40.640 --> 07:42.880
And Rogan's answer is something along the lines of, like,

07:43.840 --> 07:47.360
you know what I like about smoking weed is it makes me think about more interesting things

07:47.360 --> 07:48.960
That is a fair point

07:48.960 --> 07:51.280
Almost a way of, like, yeah, that's a dumb question

07:51.280 --> 07:52.640
That's a fair point

07:52.640 --> 07:54.160
That is a fair point on him

07:54.160 --> 07:57.600
So I just, I didn't have it in me to do that for this episode

07:57.600 --> 08:01.040
So we're talking about Thursday and Friday on the Alex Jones program

08:01.040 --> 08:01.520
Alrighty

08:01.520 --> 08:06.240
We're going to see if he's going to continue his ideas about moving to DC and living outside

08:06.240 --> 08:07.200
I think it's a good idea

08:07.200 --> 08:08.240
I think it's a good idea

08:08.240 --> 08:09.600
Spoiler alert, no updates on that

08:09.600 --> 08:10.480
No updates on that?

08:10.480 --> 08:10.800
No

08:10.800 --> 08:11.920
Did he even mention it?

08:11.920 --> 08:12.320
Nope

08:12.320 --> 08:13.520
I didn't think so

08:13.520 --> 08:15.040
I'm thinking about it more than him

08:15.040 --> 08:16.480
Yeah, that sounds right

08:17.040 --> 08:19.840
So we'll get to business on this episode, but before we do we've got to take a little

08:19.840 --> 08:22.320
moment to say thank you to some folks who've signed up and are supporting the show

08:22.320 --> 08:23.600
That sounds like a great idea

08:23.600 --> 08:28.240
Yeah, so first, great name, Dan from Colorado, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

08:28.240 --> 08:29.280
I'm a policy wonk

08:29.280 --> 08:30.000
Thanks, Dan

08:30.000 --> 08:30.800
Thank you, Dan

08:30.800 --> 08:34.560
Next, Kia I love you, you are now a policy wonk

08:34.560 --> 08:35.760
I'm a policy wonk

08:35.760 --> 08:36.960
Thank you, Kia, I love you

08:36.960 --> 08:38.320
Wait, the cars?

08:38.320 --> 08:38.720
Probably

08:38.720 --> 08:39.680
Oh, okay

08:39.680 --> 08:44.800
Next, Minnow the Cat and it's M-I-N-N-O-H, you are now a policy wonk

08:44.800 --> 08:45.760
I'm a policy wonk

08:45.760 --> 08:47.200
Thank you very much, Minnow the Cat

08:47.200 --> 08:47.840
There you go

08:47.840 --> 08:54.240
Next, Lang, J-L-A-N-G last initial J, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

08:54.240 --> 08:55.280
I'm a policy wonk

08:55.280 --> 08:56.720
Thank you very much, Lang

08:56.720 --> 08:57.040
Thank you

08:57.040 --> 08:59.680
Next, Patrick S, you are now a policy wonk

08:59.680 --> 09:00.920
I'm a Policy Wonk!

09:00.920 --> 09:01.680
Thank You Patrick!

09:01.680 --> 09:02.400
There you go!

09:02.400 --> 09:04.040
Next. EwingKing. Thank you so much.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.300
You are now a Policy Wonk!

09:05.300 --> 09:06.420
I'm a Policy Wonk!

09:06.420 --> 09:07.700
Thank you very much EwingKing!

09:07.700 --> 09:08.440
Like Patrick Ewingking

09:08.440 --> 09:09.860
Yeah there's only one king, and that's Patrick Ewing

09:09.860 --> 09:10.500
Patrick Ewing?

09:10.500 --> 09:11.000
Yeah

09:11.000 --> 09:11.500
Yep

09:11.500 --> 09:15.440
Next. Kacmek and it's spelled K-H-A-S-M-E-K

09:15.440 --> 09:16.420
Thank you so much!

09:16.420 --> 09:17.680
You are now a Policy Wonk!

09:17.680 --> 09:18.500
I'm a Policy Wonk!

09:18.500 --> 09:20.100
Thank you very much!

09:20.220 --> 09:23.020
Next. Biohazard. And finally... Biohazard.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.000
Thank you so much! You are now a Policy Wonk!

09:25.000 --> 09:25.980
I'm a Policy Wonk!

09:25.980 --> 09:27.660
Thank you very much! Biohazard!

09:27.660 --> 09:28.920
There you go! If you're out there listening you're thinkin'

09:28.920 --> 09:30.000
you're thinking, hey, I enjoyed the show,

09:30.000 --> 09:30.840
I'd like to support these gents.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.000
You can do that by going to our website,

09:32.000 --> 09:33.400
knowledgefight.com, clicking the button

09:33.400 --> 09:34.520
that says support the show, or.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.560
What you could do is you could take

09:36.560 --> 09:39.080
that feeling of generosity, you can put it

09:39.080 --> 09:41.640
into the rocket launcher that you have affixed

09:41.640 --> 09:46.160
to your back, directly on top of your rocket pack,

09:46.160 --> 09:47.000
of course. Sure.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.320
You can bend down just a little bit

09:49.320 --> 09:51.200
because a rocket launcher affixed to your back

09:51.200 --> 09:52.680
is a terrible idea.

09:52.680 --> 09:55.640
Pull your scope up and you fire that rocket launcher

09:55.640 --> 10:00.360
into the imperial cruise ship of whatever charity

10:00.360 --> 10:01.800
that you are looking for.

10:01.800 --> 10:02.640
I think that one makes sense.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.000
Was that a spoiler?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.200
No, it was not.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.400
Okay, good.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.440
All right.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.840
So Jordan, today, December 3rd, not a great episode.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.520
December 4th, there's a little bit more going on,

10:14.520 --> 10:17.800
but I did find a delightful out of context drop,

10:17.800 --> 10:20.440
which I will share with you right now.

10:20.440 --> 10:23.640
Jennifer Fleck, you're a constitutional lawyer, a patriot.

10:23.640 --> 10:27.520
There's Admiral Atbar from Turn of the Jedi.

10:27.520 --> 10:28.880
Hey, Star Wars.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.320
See, it all makes sense now.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.160
You love Star Wars.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.000
It's all coming back.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.040
It's a trap.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.520
I love the idea that Alex is like,

10:35.520 --> 10:36.840
you're a great constitutional lawyer.

10:36.840 --> 10:37.680
Hey, there's Admiral Atbar.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.240
Hey, there's Admiral Atbar over there.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.480
It's like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade

10:41.480 --> 10:44.120
has a constitutional lawyer float.

10:44.120 --> 10:47.120
Weirdly, I think that perfectly sums up Alex's show.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.760
It does kind of.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.240
Talking to some nonsense person

10:50.240 --> 10:52.800
he's calling a constitutional lawyer

10:52.800 --> 10:54.800
getting distracted by Admiral Atbar.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.640
Yeah.

10:55.640 --> 10:56.480
Ah.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.800
And how dare he maintain that he's not that into Star Wars.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.160
You son of a bitch.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.040
Yeah, so we start on the third here,

11:03.040 --> 11:06.920
and I kind of maybe glanced this off

11:06.920 --> 11:09.040
the first time I heard Alex discussing it

11:09.040 --> 11:11.160
or bringing up this little factoid,

11:11.160 --> 11:14.120
but I decided this time it would be best to look into it

11:14.120 --> 11:16.440
and discuss what was going on.

11:16.440 --> 11:23.440
Oh my gosh, now 2,777 people died yesterday.

11:23.440 --> 11:27.800
They're saying from COVID or COVID related things,

11:27.800 --> 11:29.160
which means you give them a test

11:29.160 --> 11:35.320
that the German courts have now ruled are 96% false positive.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.880
So we heard him say that on a previous episode,

11:37.880 --> 11:39.400
but I think it was in the context of something

11:39.400 --> 11:41.000
that there were bigger things going on.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.400
Yeah, it was part of a list of bullshit.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.840
But now the German courts must be brought into this.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.280
All right, let's see what happens.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.240
So this story is a little bit more complicated

11:50.240 --> 11:51.520
than what Alex is saying.

11:51.520 --> 11:52.200
That's a shock.

11:52.200 --> 11:57.920
What's at the core of it is what a German court determined

11:57.920 --> 11:59.520
was that four German citizens who

11:59.520 --> 12:01.800
were in Portugal on holiday were held illegally

12:01.800 --> 12:05.680
when they were quarantined after one tested positive for COVID-19.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.000
I don't think Portugal cares.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.640
Except it wasn't a German court, it was a Portuguese court.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.600
See, now I think Portugal cares.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.480
Yes.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.400
One of these vacationers tested positive

12:14.400 --> 12:16.280
and was in close contact with the other three,

12:16.280 --> 12:19.160
so the Portuguese authorities quarantined them in a hotel.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.360
They contested this decision, and ultimately judges

12:21.360 --> 12:23.760
found that their quarantine was unlawful.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.800
Part of the evidence that was used at their trial

12:25.800 --> 12:27.320
was related to a study that claimed

12:27.320 --> 12:30.880
that PCR tests were up to 97% unreliable

12:30.880 --> 12:33.920
and caused that ratio of false positives.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.760
However, as is always the case, that

12:35.760 --> 12:38.000
is not what the study said.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.640
This was a piece in the Clinical Infectious Diseases Journal,

12:40.640 --> 12:44.480
which looked at what is known as the cycle threshold of testing

12:44.480 --> 12:46.560
and how that could be a way to better understand

12:46.560 --> 12:49.720
viral load and the possibility of infectiousness.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.480
According to this article, the consensus

12:51.480 --> 12:53.800
had previously been to understand someone is not

12:53.800 --> 12:57.120
contagious after 10 days and a viral load that could not

12:57.120 --> 12:59.960
be identified with a cycle threshold value of 30

12:59.960 --> 13:01.200
or higher.

13:01.200 --> 13:07.240
From 13,161 positive samples, 1,941

13:07.240 --> 13:09.880
were chosen and tested using different cycle thresholds

13:09.880 --> 13:13.400
to see how the early estimates held up

13:13.400 --> 13:14.560
in those early assessments.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.080
Yeah, quality control.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.640
They found that with a cycle threshold of 25,

13:18.640 --> 13:20.920
70% of samples were still positive.

13:20.920 --> 13:24.080
At cycle threshold 30, that number dropped to 20,

13:24.080 --> 13:26.720
and that when the cycle threshold was 35,

13:26.720 --> 13:29.480
the number of positive results were less than 3%.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.280
In the publication, they literally

13:31.280 --> 13:33.280
say that this finding, using more data

13:33.280 --> 13:35.840
than their original set, does not significantly

13:35.840 --> 13:38.720
change the conclusions that had been reached previously.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.920
The finding essentially boiled down to a feeling

13:40.920 --> 13:43.800
that after 10 days, if your PCR test is

13:43.800 --> 13:47.400
at a negative with an under 30 cycle threshold,

13:47.400 --> 13:50.400
then you are almost certainly not going to be contagious.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.960
This is not proof that the PCR tests are always

13:52.960 --> 13:54.920
false positives, nor did a German court

13:54.920 --> 13:57.240
decide that the test is a scam.

13:57.240 --> 13:59.880
Alex has no idea what this story is about,

13:59.880 --> 14:02.040
nor does he even know about the study that

14:02.040 --> 14:03.720
underpins the story.

14:03.720 --> 14:07.480
Even with this information, using the cycle threshold

14:07.480 --> 14:10.680
value to infer whether or not a person is possibly infectious

14:10.680 --> 14:13.000
is not a precise way to interpret these figures,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.560
and some people definitely warn against it.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.720
There are a number of other variables to consider,

14:17.720 --> 14:20.000
but the talking point that's been taken from this

14:20.000 --> 14:22.600
publication and disseminated on right wing media

14:22.600 --> 14:25.400
is that the PCR test has been proven in German courts

14:25.400 --> 14:29.400
to be a false positive rate of 97%, which is complete bullshit.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.600
The court in Portugal ruled that the vacationers

14:31.600 --> 14:33.960
had been illegally detained based on their inability

14:33.960 --> 14:37.000
to find any indication of what the cycle threshold that

14:37.000 --> 14:39.320
was used in their positive test result was,

14:39.320 --> 14:41.840
and thus, in court, they could not defend

14:41.840 --> 14:43.760
their positive diagnosis.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.120
This was a case that was mishandled

14:45.120 --> 14:47.440
by Portuguese authorities, not an indictment

14:47.440 --> 14:49.280
of tests for COVID-19.

14:49.280 --> 14:52.760
I also just, whenever he said that last time,

14:52.760 --> 14:55.640
I was just like, this is a global pandemic

14:55.640 --> 14:57.800
that affects a lot of countries.

14:57.800 --> 15:01.000
I don't care if Germany is like,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.040
Germany's court system can't be like,

15:03.040 --> 15:05.760
eh, they're all full of shit, and I'll buy it.

15:05.760 --> 15:07.520
I just don't, I just don't care.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.920
There are other, there's other countries.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.000
They're all like, I buy it, so I'm buying.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
I found another story that I thought was

15:15.000 --> 15:16.840
what Alex was talking about, and it turns out

15:16.840 --> 15:20.600
there was a lab in Germany that processed,

15:20.600 --> 15:22.920
I think in one month they processed 60 tests

15:22.920 --> 15:26.640
and 58 were false positives, and the reason was

15:26.640 --> 15:28.840
because there was a supply shortage,

15:28.840 --> 15:32.040
and their normal reagent was unavailable to them,

15:32.040 --> 15:34.080
so they used an incompatible reagent,

15:34.080 --> 15:36.040
and the mistake was found, and like,

15:36.040 --> 15:39.040
oh, okay, I'll redo all this.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.260
But like, yeah, that was what I kinda thought

15:41.260 --> 15:44.840
would make sense, but then I looked into this story

15:44.840 --> 15:47.360
and was like, oh, this is clearly what's going on.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.800
He just thinks it's German courts,

15:48.800 --> 15:51.520
but it's Portuguese courts, it's German vacationers

15:51.520 --> 15:54.520
in Portugal, and it's a misrepresentation

15:54.520 --> 15:57.160
of what the court decided and the study

15:57.160 --> 15:59.800
that was being introduced, so.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.520
Why would I care what a court decides

16:01.520 --> 16:03.760
about coronavirus anyways?

16:03.760 --> 16:07.520
I don't trust most courts to be in any way impartial

16:07.520 --> 16:09.240
or know what they're talking about.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.760
I guess if a court decided that, I'd like to see it.

16:11.760 --> 16:12.600
Yeah.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.420
I'd like to read it.

16:13.420 --> 16:14.260
Yeah.

16:14.260 --> 16:15.100
Anyway.

16:15.100 --> 16:15.920
I would be interested.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.160
Alex has some heroes on the third,

16:17.160 --> 16:19.900
and they're the people who are staying open

16:19.900 --> 16:21.560
despite COVID.

16:21.560 --> 16:22.400
Okay.

16:22.400 --> 16:26.400
Danny Presetti, he's the owner of the popular restaurant

16:26.400 --> 16:29.440
and bar there on Staten Island.

16:29.440 --> 16:34.440
New York, New York told, hey, you're not essential, buddy.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.100
You can have a little patio out here

16:36.100 --> 16:38.580
and you can have maybe 5% of your patrons

16:38.580 --> 16:40.100
for the whole winter and maybe next year,

16:40.100 --> 16:41.500
you're going to go bankrupt.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.080
They said, no, we're essential.

16:45.460 --> 16:47.500
The police said, we're going to arrest you.

16:49.120 --> 16:49.960
So he said, you know what?

16:49.960 --> 16:52.860
I'm an autonomous zone like the commies,

16:52.860 --> 16:55.340
but they sent in their undercover police.

16:55.340 --> 16:56.180
So you're against it.

16:56.180 --> 16:58.540
They were doing something secret and arrested him.

16:58.540 --> 17:00.060
We'll go ahead and roll the footage of that.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.460
Again, this is the Alex Jones show.

17:01.460 --> 17:03.240
We're into hour number one here.

17:03.240 --> 17:05.020
So Alex has this guy's name wrong.

17:05.020 --> 17:06.780
It's not Danny Presetti.

17:06.780 --> 17:08.060
It's Danny Presti.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.140
And things took a little bit of a turn

17:10.140 --> 17:11.740
between when he recorded this episode

17:11.740 --> 17:13.020
and when we were recording ours.

17:13.020 --> 17:13.840
Okay.

17:13.840 --> 17:14.860
On the night of December 5th,

17:14.860 --> 17:16.400
Danny Presti was arrested,

17:16.400 --> 17:18.340
but it wasn't for keeping his bar open

17:18.340 --> 17:20.620
as an autonomous zone or some shit.

17:20.620 --> 17:23.580
According to NBC4 New York quote,

17:23.580 --> 17:25.180
New York City Sheriff's office said,

17:25.180 --> 17:28.140
deputies attempted to take Danny Presti, 34,

17:28.140 --> 17:30.660
into custody at just after midnight Sunday

17:30.660 --> 17:33.460
after observing patrons entering Mac's public house

17:33.460 --> 17:36.260
via an empty commercial space next door.

17:36.260 --> 17:37.740
Upon identifying themselves,

17:37.740 --> 17:40.940
the Sheriff's office said Presti allegedly fled on foot,

17:40.940 --> 17:43.880
got into his car, drove into one of the deputies,

17:43.880 --> 17:45.180
and then continued driving

17:45.180 --> 17:47.340
with the injured deputy clinging to the hood.

17:47.340 --> 17:50.100
I think that Alex would like to paint this

17:50.100 --> 17:52.060
as a situation where this guy is just like,

17:52.060 --> 17:53.780
you know, I gotta put food on the table

17:53.780 --> 17:56.460
and I'm gonna keep this going.

17:56.460 --> 18:00.060
And nah, he's hitting cops with cars.

18:00.060 --> 18:01.940
Yeah, that'll do it.

18:01.940 --> 18:02.780
Anyway.

18:02.780 --> 18:04.940
That's a little bit different from the heroic story

18:04.940 --> 18:07.240
of fighting back against a government

18:07.240 --> 18:10.060
that's out of control for closing your restaurant

18:10.060 --> 18:12.680
in the midst of a pandemic, trying not to kill people.

18:12.680 --> 18:13.520
Yeah, yeah.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.340
It's a little bit different.

18:14.340 --> 18:17.100
It's gonna be an interesting story to try and weave.

18:17.100 --> 18:19.660
But Alex is really into these small business owners, man.

18:19.660 --> 18:21.840
He's really, really worried about them.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.380
Now let's show you a town in Michigan

18:25.380 --> 18:26.700
where the business owner comes up

18:26.700 --> 18:28.260
and takes over the local live feed

18:28.260 --> 18:31.900
and says, listen, you're forcing me to fight back.

18:31.900 --> 18:32.940
You're bankrupting me.

18:32.940 --> 18:35.940
I tried to get the damn stimulus last time

18:35.940 --> 18:37.580
and I was not eligible.

18:37.580 --> 18:40.300
Listen, we went and tried just to see.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.060
We tried to log on thousands of times

18:42.060 --> 18:43.800
over a couple of months, thousands of times.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.140
I'm talking 20 times a day.

18:45.140 --> 18:46.700
I had like five employees trying

18:46.700 --> 18:48.100
because we were losing a ton of money

18:48.100 --> 18:49.180
and things were falling apart.

18:49.180 --> 18:51.020
And I wanted to just see if we could get it.

18:51.020 --> 18:52.740
Then I hired a law firm to check

18:52.740 --> 18:55.220
and they said, no, you can't get it.

18:55.220 --> 18:56.460
So what would you like?

18:56.460 --> 18:58.980
Amazon got 33 billion.

18:58.980 --> 18:59.800
That's bad.

18:59.800 --> 19:00.640
Of the stimulus money.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.180
This is a disgrace for a couple of reasons.

19:03.180 --> 19:05.480
The first and most obvious is that the stimulus

19:05.480 --> 19:07.600
that was given out and the management of it

19:07.600 --> 19:09.020
was entirely up to his hero,

19:09.020 --> 19:11.060
Donald Trump and his government.

19:11.060 --> 19:12.900
If Trump and the GOP controlled Senate

19:12.900 --> 19:14.540
had been willing to provide more support

19:14.540 --> 19:15.880
for the people who were struggling,

19:15.880 --> 19:18.540
then the stimulus probably would have been much larger.

19:18.540 --> 19:20.520
If Trump's government was at all concerned

19:20.520 --> 19:22.280
with governing and competent leadership,

19:22.280 --> 19:24.180
then the website that Alex had trouble using

19:24.180 --> 19:26.040
probably might've been better.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.620
The people that Alex supports and deifies

19:28.620 --> 19:31.180
are the exact people who could have averted the problem

19:31.180 --> 19:32.220
that he's complaining about,

19:32.220 --> 19:33.940
but Alex refuses to acknowledge that.

19:33.940 --> 19:37.340
It's just so fucking Republican to destroy the country

19:37.340 --> 19:39.300
and then be like, see, government can't work.

19:39.300 --> 19:40.140
Yeah.

19:40.140 --> 19:43.000
The second problem is that if Democrats had been in charge

19:43.000 --> 19:45.340
and a robust stimulus package had been passed

19:45.340 --> 19:46.840
that allowed these small business owners

19:46.840 --> 19:48.660
to comfortably survive this health crisis.

19:48.660 --> 19:49.660
Commies!

19:49.660 --> 19:50.500
Exactly.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.940
Alex would be super against that.

19:51.940 --> 19:52.780
Yep.

19:52.780 --> 19:54.100
He hates welfare and he hates the idea

19:54.100 --> 19:55.540
of a social safety net.

19:55.540 --> 19:57.440
If these business owners were being paid

19:57.440 --> 19:59.500
to close temporarily to deal with the virus,

19:59.500 --> 20:01.100
it would be proof that the nanny state

20:01.100 --> 20:02.540
was trying to make all business owners

20:02.540 --> 20:04.640
dependent on them to survive.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.400
In a situation like the one we're in,

20:06.400 --> 20:07.980
there is nothing that leaders can do

20:07.980 --> 20:10.740
that will appease the shithead fake populists like Alex.

20:10.740 --> 20:11.580
You got it.

20:11.580 --> 20:13.040
If they pass massive spending bills

20:13.040 --> 20:14.020
to take care of the public,

20:14.020 --> 20:15.760
it's proof of a communist conspiracy

20:15.760 --> 20:19.140
trying to pacify the population in order to make up serfs.

20:19.140 --> 20:21.200
If they don't pass massive spending bills

20:21.200 --> 20:22.400
to take care of people,

20:22.400 --> 20:24.460
it's proof that they only care about Jeff Bezos,

20:24.460 --> 20:26.420
which is proof that it's a grand conspiracy

20:26.420 --> 20:27.800
to make you dependent on Bezos,

20:27.800 --> 20:29.540
which will bring in communism or something.

20:29.540 --> 20:30.380
Sure.

20:30.380 --> 20:33.380
This is the part of Alex's politics that's a trap.

20:33.380 --> 20:35.460
The joke is on you if you take him seriously

20:35.460 --> 20:37.620
because he doesn't give a shit about any of this.

20:37.620 --> 20:39.420
It's emotionally satisfying to yell

20:39.420 --> 20:40.760
about the small business owners

20:40.760 --> 20:42.060
who were hurt by the shutdown,

20:42.060 --> 20:45.540
but his principles don't allow any other response

20:45.540 --> 20:46.660
to a crisis like this.

20:46.660 --> 20:47.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.940
The only thing he can actually advocate

20:48.940 --> 20:50.860
is acting like there is no virus,

20:50.860 --> 20:52.980
which sounds better when you just present it

20:52.980 --> 20:55.420
as yelling about these poor business owners.

20:55.420 --> 20:58.220
I agree, though, that business owners have been fucked over

20:58.220 --> 21:00.020
in this case, 100%.

21:00.020 --> 21:01.340
But Bezos haven't.

21:01.340 --> 21:03.620
Yeah, I don't think that there's problems

21:03.620 --> 21:05.740
with some of the descriptive things

21:05.740 --> 21:07.100
that Alex is talking about. Totally.

21:07.100 --> 21:10.000
I'll just never respect him to speak on the subject

21:10.000 --> 21:12.580
because he's not a sincere, genuine actor in this.

21:12.580 --> 21:13.820
He's full of shit. No, it's the way

21:13.820 --> 21:14.900
it always works.

21:14.900 --> 21:18.520
Whenever things are going well, relatively speaking,

21:18.520 --> 21:19.360
Republicans are like,

21:19.360 --> 21:22.260
see, they could be going better

21:22.260 --> 21:25.800
if we just got away with all this regulation and shit.

21:25.800 --> 21:26.640
And then people are like,

21:26.640 --> 21:27.820
yeah, that's a great idea.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.020
And they elect Republicans

21:29.020 --> 21:30.860
and Republicans destroy everything.

21:30.860 --> 21:32.700
And then by the time we're here,

21:32.700 --> 21:35.540
four years later, whenever we're not going to have one,

21:35.540 --> 21:37.060
they switch their tune and they're like,

21:37.060 --> 21:39.220
why hasn't government done anything for us?

21:39.220 --> 21:43.860
And it's like, Alex is the only person

21:43.860 --> 21:47.140
that forces me to constantly say like, how dare you?

21:47.140 --> 21:50.180
There's so much drama written in how dare you?

21:50.180 --> 21:51.940
And it's kind of overused and boring,

21:51.940 --> 21:55.780
but Alex doing that makes me just go, how dare you, sir?

21:55.780 --> 21:57.240
Yeah, I think he's the only person

21:57.240 --> 21:59.300
because he's the only person we look at this much.

21:59.300 --> 22:00.300
Yeah, that's true.

22:00.300 --> 22:01.620
I bet if we covered Rush-

22:01.620 --> 22:04.140
No, no, I'd do 300 other people a day.

22:04.140 --> 22:06.380
But I mean, if we did a show about Rush Limbaugh,

22:06.380 --> 22:07.580
I guarantee you he'd be saying,

22:07.580 --> 22:09.100
how dare you, Mr. Limbaugh.

22:09.100 --> 22:09.940
No, of course.

22:09.940 --> 22:10.780
Or Hannity or any of them.

22:10.780 --> 22:11.620
Of course, they're full of shit.

22:11.620 --> 22:16.140
Yeah, so on this day, Alex is pretty excited

22:16.140 --> 22:18.740
because he has that Rogan interview already recorded.

22:18.740 --> 22:19.580
Sure.

22:19.580 --> 22:22.780
And you know, I think it's been my contention

22:22.780 --> 22:25.980
and I don't know, what's stronger than a contention?

22:25.980 --> 22:26.820
Certainty?

22:29.740 --> 22:31.380
Yeah, I would say certainty works.

22:31.380 --> 22:32.340
I'm positive.

22:32.340 --> 22:33.180
Concluding?

22:33.180 --> 22:36.340
Yeah, Alex is using Joe Rogan to try and appeal

22:36.340 --> 22:39.660
to a wider audience than he has access to.

22:39.660 --> 22:42.740
And it's kind of nice that Alex just outright says so.

22:42.740 --> 22:44.860
We're gonna air some of the highlights and excerpts

22:44.860 --> 22:47.220
coming up at the bottom of the next hour.

22:47.220 --> 22:50.420
And then at about one o'clock or so,

22:51.380 --> 22:55.180
we're gonna post the full four plus hour interview.

22:55.180 --> 22:56.500
And the reason this is important is,

22:56.500 --> 23:00.700
everything Joe does gets millions of views.

23:00.700 --> 23:04.100
And everything he does with me gets 20, 30, 40 million views

23:04.100 --> 23:06.260
and with a lot of other people interviews are,

23:06.260 --> 23:07.460
or he talks to her big as well.

23:07.460 --> 23:11.260
But Joe doesn't do a lot of interviews.

23:11.260 --> 23:16.140
And so this is a great way to reach out to new people

23:16.140 --> 23:17.620
that, oh, I don't wanna look at Alex Jones,

23:17.620 --> 23:19.100
but they'll look at something that Joe Rogan's doing.

23:19.100 --> 23:21.100
And so this is a powerful interview.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.940
This is an important thing to understand

23:22.940 --> 23:26.100
and this is why Joe's kind of being used here,

23:26.100 --> 23:29.700
is that Alex has a pretty keen awareness

23:29.700 --> 23:32.260
that people look at this if it's Joe,

23:32.260 --> 23:35.580
but they won't look at it if it's me because I'm a lunatic.

23:35.580 --> 23:39.580
Now, the issue for me comes down to,

23:39.580 --> 23:42.580
do you remember, I'm pretending Joe's listening now.

23:42.580 --> 23:43.420
Yes, yeah, yeah.

23:43.420 --> 23:44.980
Do you remember when Alex was screaming

23:44.980 --> 23:46.180
about your kids on air?

23:46.180 --> 23:47.020
Sure.

23:47.020 --> 23:48.300
Do you remember when he was calling you a sneaky snake

23:48.300 --> 23:50.700
and saying he was going to destroy you?

23:50.700 --> 23:51.540
Yeah.

23:51.540 --> 23:52.900
Do you remember when he said that you were a globalist?

23:52.900 --> 23:53.740
Right.

23:53.740 --> 23:54.620
Do you remember all that stuff?

23:54.620 --> 23:57.800
That was when you weren't making yourself available

23:57.800 --> 23:58.820
to be used.

23:58.820 --> 23:59.660
So wait, are you saying-

23:59.660 --> 24:02.620
That was in response to when you got on your show

24:02.620 --> 24:04.340
and said that you can't have Alex on

24:04.340 --> 24:05.660
because of the Sandy Hook stuff.

24:05.660 --> 24:07.020
Oh no, he's my friend.

24:07.020 --> 24:10.180
No, you said he was not somebody who your platform

24:10.180 --> 24:13.380
was available to, he talked about your fucking kids

24:13.380 --> 24:16.300
on his show, said he was going to chop you up

24:16.300 --> 24:17.340
like a sneaky snake.

24:17.340 --> 24:18.500
That's just how he talks.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.020
And then now, oh what do you know,

24:20.020 --> 24:21.700
your platform's available to him.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.300
You're gonna come, you live in Austin,

24:23.300 --> 24:24.440
you're gonna come on his show,

24:24.440 --> 24:26.160
he gets to use you for publicity.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.980
Now all of a sudden you're not a sneaky snake,

24:27.980 --> 24:28.820
you're one of the best.

24:28.820 --> 24:30.940
I have a history of unhealthy relationships.

24:30.940 --> 24:32.020
Is that what you wanted to hear?

24:32.020 --> 24:35.580
Jesus, how fucking transparently obvious could this be?

24:35.580 --> 24:38.060
Like- I was thinking it's,

24:39.220 --> 24:42.100
look, we knew it, he knew it,

24:42.100 --> 24:44.820
maybe Joe is the only person who doesn't know it,

24:44.820 --> 24:45.860
but he probably knows it too.

24:45.860 --> 24:49.880
If he doesn't, he has the most awesome mentality

24:49.880 --> 24:52.500
and I'm jealous of him and the naivete.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.740
Yeah, he lives a better life.

24:54.740 --> 24:55.740
Yeah.

24:55.740 --> 24:57.900
But at the same time, whenever he said it,

24:57.900 --> 24:59.540
I was like, well, that's gauche.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.900
That's a little, look, that's a little gauche.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.460
Look, here's the deal.

25:04.460 --> 25:06.780
I'm trying to use this dude to Trojan horse

25:06.780 --> 25:08.660
my extremist views onto audiences

25:08.660 --> 25:10.360
that know better than to listen to me.

25:10.360 --> 25:13.020
Look, we all know that, but it's tacky to say it.

25:13.020 --> 25:14.300
Right.

25:14.300 --> 25:17.060
So I had a nightmare the other night.

25:17.060 --> 25:20.460
I know that it's also not great to talk about dreams.

25:20.460 --> 25:22.260
And it was that our show disappeared

25:22.260 --> 25:24.180
because of like copyright issues.

25:24.180 --> 25:25.020
Sure.

25:25.020 --> 25:26.060
You know, I know this is fair use

25:26.060 --> 25:28.320
through using Alex's stuff,

25:28.320 --> 25:30.200
but it's still something that worries me is like,

25:30.200 --> 25:32.820
hey, is there a possibility that, you know,

25:32.820 --> 25:35.020
we could have all of our episodes taken down.

25:35.020 --> 25:36.260
Don't give him ideas.

25:36.260 --> 25:37.940
Well, it's too late because on his show,

25:37.940 --> 25:39.140
he gave us permission to do this show.

25:39.140 --> 25:40.220
Oh, that's good.

25:40.220 --> 25:42.660
By the way, everything I do is free to air.

25:42.660 --> 25:44.700
Everything I do is copyright free,

25:45.980 --> 25:49.500
meaning that you can take it, you can share it,

25:49.500 --> 25:51.380
you can edit it, you can cut it,

25:51.380 --> 25:53.340
you can play it on your show.

25:53.340 --> 25:55.260
We get so many emails and so many letters saying,

25:55.260 --> 25:58.680
can I paint Infowars on my barn?

25:58.680 --> 26:01.680
Or can I make copies of your DVD and get them out?

26:01.680 --> 26:02.520
You better.

26:02.520 --> 26:03.500
You better.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.780
So apparently not only do we have his blessing,

26:05.780 --> 26:08.220
we have his insistence that we do this show.

26:08.220 --> 26:10.740
Dear Alex Jones at Infowars,

26:10.740 --> 26:13.620
my barn is looking a little worn down.

26:13.620 --> 26:18.060
Do you think I could paint Infowars upon the side of it, sir?

26:18.060 --> 26:20.380
Alex, I wanted to paint Infowars on my barn,

26:20.380 --> 26:22.020
but I was worried about getting sued.

26:22.020 --> 26:26.460
Yeah.

26:26.460 --> 26:29.100
Hey, Rob, Rob Dew,

26:29.100 --> 26:32.340
I got word that someone in Nebraska

26:32.340 --> 26:34.220
has got some paint cans.

26:34.220 --> 26:36.240
Rob, Rob, you know how we will do-

26:36.240 --> 26:37.300
Call Robert Barnes.

26:37.300 --> 26:41.700
Rob, we will do anything and everything for free publicity,

26:41.700 --> 26:44.820
but this one time, look, I fucking hate Barnes.

26:44.820 --> 26:45.900
That's what it is.

26:45.900 --> 26:49.020
I hate Robert Barnes and I hate Barnes.

26:49.020 --> 26:49.860
The end.

26:49.860 --> 26:51.940
Maybe that's what the person was asking for permission for

26:51.940 --> 26:54.500
is to paint it on Robert Barnes.

26:54.500 --> 26:55.340
Now-

26:55.340 --> 26:56.180
That does require permission.

26:56.180 --> 26:57.280
That probably does.

26:57.280 --> 27:00.140
And Alex's permission too about Barnes.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.620
This was back when Barnes was an employee.

27:02.620 --> 27:05.360
So like I said, he's, you know,

27:05.360 --> 27:07.340
Rogan is making himself available

27:07.340 --> 27:08.960
and helping Alex get attention.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.380
And so that means that he is brave.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.220
He is a big, brave boy.

27:13.220 --> 27:16.820
And it turns out that Tucker Carlson,

27:16.820 --> 27:18.380
while his rhetoric is good,

27:18.380 --> 27:21.540
he's not somebody that is going to have Alex on his show.

27:21.540 --> 27:22.380
What a whiny-

27:22.380 --> 27:24.380
So he's not as good as Rogan.

27:24.380 --> 27:25.660
So you can sit back and say,

27:25.660 --> 27:27.620
oh, well, Joe Rogan should do more.

27:27.620 --> 27:29.380
No one else in his position is.

27:29.380 --> 27:31.100
And look, I like Tucker Carlson.

27:31.100 --> 27:31.920
I admire him.

27:31.920 --> 27:32.760
He's a friend.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.140
We talk.

27:34.140 --> 27:35.440
I'll leave it at that.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.740
But I'm banned from going on his show.

27:37.740 --> 27:39.220
And he used to plug Info Wars on there.

27:39.220 --> 27:40.460
And, you know, obviously you don't see that anymore.

27:40.460 --> 27:43.260
Cause they, you know, it's, it's, it's,

27:43.260 --> 27:45.520
nobody's been willing to go to bat for me

27:45.520 --> 27:47.800
in a big position of power.

27:47.800 --> 27:48.640
Oh no.

27:48.640 --> 27:50.440
Other than Trump behind the scenes.

27:50.440 --> 27:52.340
And, you know, Biden gets in.

27:53.180 --> 27:56.380
I got told last week, hell, I got told two days ago.

27:56.380 --> 27:57.220
You're fucked.

27:57.220 --> 27:58.740
That I'm enemy number two.

27:58.740 --> 28:03.740
He said, Jones, I got this call.

28:04.700 --> 28:06.860
Even in your imagination, you're number two.

28:06.860 --> 28:09.060
Works with the Clintons as a Republican.

28:09.060 --> 28:10.660
He said, Jones, you had enough yet?

28:10.660 --> 28:13.060
You ready to come in out of the cold?

28:13.060 --> 28:15.140
And I said, just as soon as you stop running slave camps

28:15.140 --> 28:17.420
in China, just as soon as you guys stop being involved

28:17.420 --> 28:18.260
in pedophilia.

28:18.260 --> 28:19.100
How about that?

28:19.100 --> 28:19.920
How about that?

28:19.920 --> 28:20.760
How about that?

28:20.760 --> 28:21.900
How about that?

28:21.900 --> 28:24.140
How about that thoroughly fictitious person

28:24.140 --> 28:25.740
that I didn't invent right now.

28:25.740 --> 28:28.780
Here's some tough talk for you voice in my head.

28:28.780 --> 28:31.580
Yeah, Alex is public enemy number two.

28:31.580 --> 28:33.660
Once Biden gets in there, I don't even know.

28:33.660 --> 28:35.300
I would be interested to find out

28:35.300 --> 28:38.700
if Biden actually even knows who Alex Jones is.

28:38.700 --> 28:40.500
I would imagine there's a possibility,

28:40.500 --> 28:42.300
but there's also a possibility that he doesn't.

28:42.300 --> 28:46.140
I think the people around Biden would know Jones.

28:46.140 --> 28:48.580
I don't think Biden has ever actually been like,

28:48.580 --> 28:50.680
I don't think they even need to broach the subject.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.180
Like he might've gone like,

28:52.180 --> 28:54.180
Hey, who's this Alex Jones character?

28:54.180 --> 28:56.580
And they're like, listen, you don't need to worry about it.

28:56.580 --> 28:57.660
Here's what I would say.

28:57.660 --> 28:59.980
He is as aware of Alex Jones

28:59.980 --> 29:01.860
as I am of the Property Brothers.

29:01.860 --> 29:02.740
Sure.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.740
That probably sounds right. I know that show exists.

29:04.740 --> 29:05.580
It does.

29:05.580 --> 29:06.740
And there are a couple of them.

29:06.740 --> 29:09.060
I've seen them somewhere.

29:09.060 --> 29:11.420
I don't know what their show is about.

29:11.420 --> 29:12.240
Smiling.

29:12.240 --> 29:13.080
I guess.

29:13.080 --> 29:14.020
Yeah, mainly.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.060
I would imagine that it's kind of like that.

29:16.060 --> 29:18.060
He's aware of Alex's existence,

29:18.060 --> 29:20.660
but probably has no idea.

29:20.660 --> 29:22.940
That's my sense on it.

29:22.940 --> 29:24.540
I would prefer if Alex Jones did

29:24.540 --> 29:26.280
a Property Brothers type thing.

29:26.280 --> 29:28.280
What if he just fixed houses on TV?

29:28.280 --> 29:29.120
That'd be great.

29:29.120 --> 29:29.940
Poorly?

29:29.940 --> 29:31.700
Yeah, that'd be the best part.

29:31.700 --> 29:33.940
He does the exact same amount of work.

29:33.940 --> 29:34.780
I would be into it.

29:34.780 --> 29:35.620
Yeah, I'd watch that.

29:35.620 --> 29:39.060
So someone's called him and says that the DOJ under Biden

29:39.060 --> 29:40.300
is gonna come at you.

29:40.300 --> 29:41.180
They're gonna come after you.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.020
I'd be fine with that.

29:42.020 --> 29:43.500
But there's a possibility though,

29:43.500 --> 29:44.940
that this is all just a ploy.

29:44.940 --> 29:48.220
They're trying to get Alex onto the team.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.220
I don't want to be given immunity by you

29:50.220 --> 29:53.060
because you don't have it from God.

29:53.060 --> 29:54.620
I've got my immunity.

29:54.620 --> 29:55.780
Thank you very much.

29:55.780 --> 29:56.620
All right.

30:01.380 --> 30:02.780
Paul looks so inviting.

30:02.780 --> 30:05.480
Oh, all the money, all the private jets,

30:05.480 --> 30:07.620
all the best medicine, all the best sex,

30:07.620 --> 30:09.940
all the best drugs, just Jones, we love you.

30:09.940 --> 30:11.340
Just come with us.

30:11.340 --> 30:12.180
Come.

30:12.180 --> 30:13.540
You don't think I get hate from the enemy.

30:13.540 --> 30:14.920
You know, it's like, oh, Jones,

30:14.920 --> 30:16.260
we know you're gonna make the right decision.

30:16.260 --> 30:19.500
We know you're gonna come over to us, Jones.

30:19.500 --> 30:20.420
Come to us.

30:20.420 --> 30:21.540
Come here.

30:21.540 --> 30:22.480
Come to us.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.320
Come.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.540
Come to us.

30:25.840 --> 30:26.680
No.

30:26.680 --> 30:27.580
Meanwhile, all these corporate lawyers

30:27.580 --> 30:29.020
and all these sellouts would do,

30:29.020 --> 30:31.380
they'd kill their firstborn to be part of this.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.280
It's disgusting.

30:37.660 --> 30:38.960
And I won't be part of it.

30:40.300 --> 30:41.220
And I'll stay in this fight

30:41.220 --> 30:43.020
as long as you keep me in the fight.

30:43.020 --> 30:43.860
Hey, man.

30:43.860 --> 30:44.680
Two things that are back in stock.

30:44.680 --> 30:46.920
Prosta guards have been sold out for quite a while.

30:46.920 --> 30:47.760
Oof.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.660
Oof.

30:49.660 --> 30:51.020
Oh, boy.

30:51.020 --> 30:51.860
That's amazing.

30:51.860 --> 30:52.680
Oh, boy.

30:52.680 --> 30:53.520
Oh, God.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.820
You could just, you could hear him looking at the clock.

30:55.820 --> 30:56.660
Totally.

30:56.660 --> 30:57.480
You could hear him

30:57.480 --> 30:58.320
tiling it out to break.

30:58.320 --> 30:59.420
Come, come, come.

30:59.420 --> 31:00.260
15 seconds left.

31:00.260 --> 31:01.500
Come, come.

31:01.500 --> 31:02.500
20 seconds left.

31:02.500 --> 31:03.860
How did I get the, yeah.

31:03.860 --> 31:05.540
Prosta guards back in stock.

31:05.540 --> 31:07.020
So stupid.

31:07.020 --> 31:09.620
They try and steal me away from you guys

31:09.620 --> 31:12.900
and the only thing keeping me from them is your money.

31:12.900 --> 31:14.320
I'm gonna stay in this fight

31:14.320 --> 31:16.040
as long as you're giving me money, too.

31:16.040 --> 31:16.880
But let me tell you,

31:16.880 --> 31:20.300
I have offers that others would kill their children for.

31:20.300 --> 31:22.340
Listen, here's what I'm telling you.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.500
The moment I don't have your money,

31:24.500 --> 31:26.740
I'm on their team for money.

31:26.740 --> 31:28.060
Sounds heroic.

31:28.060 --> 31:29.620
Yeah.

31:29.620 --> 31:31.780
Now, admittedly, I've gotten none of those offers

31:31.780 --> 31:32.620
that I lied about.

31:32.620 --> 31:33.440
No.

31:33.440 --> 31:34.940
And the DOJ is not gonna come after you.

31:34.940 --> 31:36.100
Doubtful.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.820
So Alex goes to commercial after talking about Prosta Guard

31:38.820 --> 31:42.980
and man, he loves that song, Bad to the Bone.

31:42.980 --> 31:43.820
Yeah.

31:43.820 --> 31:45.060
And I would say that it sucks.

31:45.060 --> 31:46.500
I would say, and I'm sorry.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.340
The part where he goes,

31:47.340 --> 31:49.100
buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

31:49.100 --> 31:49.940
Do you like that part?

31:49.940 --> 31:52.220
I just, it's so droning.

31:52.220 --> 31:54.020
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

31:54.020 --> 31:55.080
Bad.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.020
That's what I would say it is.

31:56.020 --> 31:58.460
It's buh buh buh buh bad as a song.

31:58.460 --> 32:00.500
Anyway, Alex is listening to this

32:00.500 --> 32:01.540
and he's just loving it.

32:01.540 --> 32:02.740
He just fucking loves it.

32:02.740 --> 32:04.820
And then he has this weird fantasy.

32:04.820 --> 32:08.300
I wanna be yours, pretty baby.

32:08.300 --> 32:10.740
Yours and yours alone.

32:10.740 --> 32:12.620
And I'm here to tell you

32:12.620 --> 32:14.260
that I'm bad to the bone.

32:14.260 --> 32:15.900
Buh buh buh bad.

32:15.900 --> 32:17.060
Bad to the bone.

32:17.060 --> 32:21.140
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.820
Some good music right here.

32:22.820 --> 32:24.860
So like I'm cruising on the highway at night.

32:24.860 --> 32:25.700
About 120.

32:25.700 --> 32:27.740
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

32:27.740 --> 32:29.700
It's a nice cruise to speak.

32:29.700 --> 32:30.540
With the desert.

32:30.540 --> 32:31.980
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

32:31.980 --> 32:33.780
Till that jack rabbit runs out in front of you.

32:33.780 --> 32:34.620
What just happened?

32:34.620 --> 32:35.460
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

32:35.460 --> 32:36.420
The car starts spinning.

32:36.420 --> 32:38.060
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

32:38.060 --> 32:39.860
The way out in the desert a hundred yards.

32:39.860 --> 32:40.820
Lucky you're not dead.

32:40.820 --> 32:41.660
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

32:41.660 --> 32:46.060
The way out in the desert a hundred and fifty down the highway.

32:46.060 --> 32:46.900
What?

32:46.900 --> 32:47.740
I've got a message to present.

32:47.740 --> 32:49.300
A message to all of you.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.140
Okay.

32:50.140 --> 32:51.100
All right.

32:51.100 --> 32:51.940
It's fantasy.

32:51.940 --> 32:54.860
Is that message learn the wrong lessons from things?

32:54.860 --> 32:55.940
Yeah.

32:55.940 --> 32:56.780
That's, oh yeah.

32:56.780 --> 32:58.500
I mean, I guess that's a metaphor for his career.

32:58.500 --> 32:59.340
Yeah.

32:59.340 --> 33:01.580
He's like, you're driving irresponsibly.

33:01.580 --> 33:04.540
You get knocked off the road by happenstance.

33:04.540 --> 33:05.380
And then you go.

33:05.380 --> 33:07.380
Twice as fast, baby.

33:07.380 --> 33:08.460
Just as irresponsible.

33:08.460 --> 33:09.540
Let's keep on going.

33:09.540 --> 33:10.860
Yeah.

33:10.860 --> 33:13.060
I would say that's a bad fantasy.

33:13.060 --> 33:15.340
You know, like why not just keep on driving

33:15.340 --> 33:17.900
down the desert road at 120.

33:17.900 --> 33:18.740
Yeah.

33:18.740 --> 33:19.580
It's a fantasy.

33:19.580 --> 33:20.500
That jackrabbit does not have to be there.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.140
I mean, I guess stories aren't interesting

33:22.140 --> 33:23.940
without conflict of some sort.

33:23.940 --> 33:25.020
You know, you have to have a,

33:25.020 --> 33:27.420
I guess this is more of a man versus nature

33:27.420 --> 33:30.740
kind of thematic story about.

33:30.740 --> 33:34.100
The story as it is with context, not interesting.

33:34.100 --> 33:35.700
Could be man versus self.

33:35.700 --> 33:37.260
That could be a good starting point.

33:37.260 --> 33:38.620
Alex is the jackrabbit.

33:38.620 --> 33:39.460
Exactly.

33:39.460 --> 33:42.380
So he wants to take some time here on this episode

33:42.380 --> 33:46.820
to play clips of his Rogan interview.

33:46.820 --> 33:47.660
Sure.

33:47.660 --> 33:50.540
He wants to bring that into the show itself.

33:50.540 --> 33:52.340
But there's a problem.

33:52.340 --> 33:53.900
There's a problem.

33:53.900 --> 33:54.740
It's copyrighted.

33:54.740 --> 33:56.020
No.

33:56.020 --> 33:57.780
People haven't edited those clips.

33:58.780 --> 34:00.260
You know, I've got this big Trump clip

34:00.260 --> 34:02.420
that I think is the best out of the 49 minutes speech.

34:02.420 --> 34:04.380
We're going to air when we come back after that.

34:04.380 --> 34:06.580
And then I guess we'll push other guests

34:06.580 --> 34:09.020
back into the Joe Rogan stuff tomorrow, maybe.

34:09.020 --> 34:14.420
Oh, because I'm not sure we can hear that.

34:14.420 --> 34:18.940
But, you know, there's there's there's there's so much more.

34:18.940 --> 34:24.900
To get to here today and so many angles to all of this bullshit.

34:24.900 --> 34:29.340
But. I'm being sarcastic this morning.

34:29.340 --> 34:30.900
I said, can I just have three clips,

34:30.900 --> 34:33.500
just one clip from each person involved editing this?

34:33.500 --> 34:36.780
And I'm just going to hear those at 1230.

34:36.780 --> 34:39.660
It's going to be like 15 clips and I don't have them yet.

34:39.660 --> 34:40.460
And I'm not mad.

34:40.460 --> 34:42.020
It's just we just won't do it,

34:42.020 --> 34:44.580
because that's the only power I've got at this point

34:44.580 --> 34:47.660
is that every time we do this, just to give up,

34:47.660 --> 34:49.700
because I got a lot of political news

34:49.700 --> 34:51.140
and a lot of the sphere covered.

34:51.140 --> 34:53.020
At least I can post the whole Joe Rogan interview.

34:53.020 --> 34:55.300
We can get that done demand on video.

34:55.300 --> 34:58.940
So that should be up by that should be up by next hour for you.

34:58.940 --> 35:02.020
But again, the news websites are info wars dot com

35:02.020 --> 35:05.980
and news wars dot com and so much more.

35:05.980 --> 35:10.980
Separately. To fund this operation,

35:10.980 --> 35:12.620
we need your support.

35:12.620 --> 35:17.260
A lot of a lot of ad transitions.

35:17.260 --> 35:20.540
I do appreciate the idea that he's saying, like, OK,

35:20.540 --> 35:23.700
when these things happen, the only power I have is to give up,

35:23.700 --> 35:26.020
which kind of means like I run this whole thing

35:26.020 --> 35:29.140
and I'm going on strike against my subordinate.

35:29.140 --> 35:31.820
How dare my subordinates do what?

35:31.820 --> 35:33.460
What are we doing? What's the problem here?

35:33.460 --> 35:37.020
Oh, wait, they gave me more options than I had requested.

35:37.020 --> 35:40.340
Overachievers, a bunch of dicks, 15 clips here

35:40.340 --> 35:42.580
instead of the three that I had requested.

35:42.580 --> 35:44.580
I can't possibly be bothered to look through

35:44.580 --> 35:46.500
and choose the ones I want to use.

35:46.500 --> 35:51.020
No, I must on air throw a tantrum and threaten to go on strike.

35:51.020 --> 35:55.660
I this is the type of stuff where you go, you know what?

35:55.660 --> 35:57.900
A lot of people think this guy is a leader.

35:57.900 --> 36:01.700
Yeah, the only the only thing I have left to me

36:01.700 --> 36:04.460
is to give up in the face of adversity.

36:04.460 --> 36:08.100
And the when there is a challenge, I say no.

36:08.100 --> 36:11.060
And the adversity is like something you could sort out

36:11.060 --> 36:13.060
during a commercial break easily.

36:13.060 --> 36:18.660
Oh, just oh, hey, hey, guys, could you pick a couple of those clips

36:18.660 --> 36:20.380
for me and then just send them over real quick?

36:20.380 --> 36:23.540
Cool. If the devil is up against this guy,

36:23.540 --> 36:26.540
if like this guy is the dude who's like going to stand up to the devil,

36:26.540 --> 36:31.020
I'd be like, I guess I could just inconvenience him a little.

36:31.020 --> 36:34.020
Maybe this is the devil doesn't even have to destroy Alex

36:34.020 --> 36:35.540
or any kind of elaborate plan.

36:35.540 --> 36:37.700
He could just make his life a little annoying.

36:37.700 --> 36:39.500
And I was like, fuck it. I don't care.

36:39.500 --> 36:42.260
Maybe this is God like flexing on Satan.

36:42.260 --> 36:44.540
Like, see, this is how much better than you I am.

36:44.540 --> 36:48.180
I'm going to pick Alex Jones as your mortal enemy.

36:48.180 --> 36:49.940
It's like it's like Braun Strowman

36:49.940 --> 36:53.700
winning the tag team championship with a 12 year old child.

36:53.700 --> 36:57.900
All right, here's here's who we've got going up against Ivan Drago.

36:57.900 --> 37:00.580
Mr. Magoo. Oh, quite a match.

37:00.580 --> 37:01.500
Yeah, that'll do it.

37:01.500 --> 37:05.380
So Alex does finally get some clips of Rogan.

37:05.380 --> 37:09.500
Like, I am probably going to have to do this as an episode.

37:09.500 --> 37:15.420
Oh, no. But like, they sound so fucked up just in this one clip that they play.

37:15.420 --> 37:16.740
Oh, God.

37:16.740 --> 37:24.900
And I understand that you'd be reluctant to ever accept or or multiply.

37:24.900 --> 37:28.500
Awful ideas, but the best way to combat

37:28.500 --> 37:32.420
that and it's been shown throughout history is better ideas.

37:32.420 --> 37:36.140
The simplest way to combat that is to shut it down.

37:36.140 --> 37:41.260
It's like if you have a kid and you're and you say you got to go to bed

37:41.260 --> 37:43.220
and your kid goes, why do I have to go to bed?

37:43.220 --> 37:47.820
And you go, shut the fuck up.

37:47.820 --> 37:48.900
It's sort of the same thing.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.740
Dad, is that you?

37:50.740 --> 37:55.140
It's a crazy interview, four plus hours long, a lot of leaves, a lot of surprises.

37:55.140 --> 37:57.540
Yeah, a lot of surprises.

37:57.540 --> 38:03.900
I guess Joe's implying in that clip that you should debate your child about bedtimes.

38:03.900 --> 38:05.580
Yeah. Yep.

38:05.580 --> 38:10.460
OK, well, also in that context, you're framing yourself as the child.

38:10.460 --> 38:12.780
And the parent does make the rules.

38:12.780 --> 38:13.220
You got it.

38:13.220 --> 38:15.060
So the bedtime is the bedtime.

38:15.060 --> 38:15.900
That would make sense.

38:15.900 --> 38:21.100
And so if the bedtime is sort of analogous to being kicked off social media,

38:21.100 --> 38:23.060
you're going to abide by the bedtime.

38:23.060 --> 38:23.740
Yeah.

38:23.740 --> 38:26.100
Whether you fall asleep or not, it's on you.

38:26.100 --> 38:30.420
But you're going to be in that bed because they're your fucking parents.

38:30.420 --> 38:33.860
In many ways, one thing that you are learning how to be

38:33.860 --> 38:38.580
is a member of society in so far as your actions affect others.

38:38.580 --> 38:44.220
And in the same way, the people who are doing this bullshit

38:44.220 --> 38:49.420
are children who need to be part of society, which means there are rules.

38:49.420 --> 38:50.780
Yeah, yeah.

38:50.780 --> 38:53.940
The metaphor may work not in the way he wants,

38:53.940 --> 38:56.860
but it might work a lot better than he realizes.

38:56.860 --> 38:57.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:57.660 --> 39:02.260
Anyway, I think one of the reasons that Joe sounds so fucked up in that clip

39:02.260 --> 39:05.140
is I think they did something to the audio.

39:05.140 --> 39:07.140
His voice doesn't sound right.

39:07.140 --> 39:09.700
It's either sped up slightly or slow.

39:09.700 --> 39:11.940
I don't know what it is, but it doesn't have the same tone

39:11.940 --> 39:13.940
as Joe's voice normally does.

39:13.940 --> 39:15.100
So I don't know what it is.

39:15.100 --> 39:16.620
I think somebody messed that up.

39:16.620 --> 39:19.460
Nah, he probably just has better sound people on his own show.

39:19.460 --> 39:21.540
I don't think so because I listen to, like I said,

39:21.540 --> 39:25.500
the first half hour or 20 minutes of it, and it doesn't sound like that.

39:25.500 --> 39:28.580
No, there was something wrong with the replay of it.

39:28.580 --> 39:29.620
Oh, boy.

39:29.620 --> 39:30.980
But yeah, it's like...

39:30.980 --> 39:34.060
Well, the only option we have here, Dan, is to give up.

39:34.060 --> 39:35.260
Got to.

39:35.260 --> 39:38.900
If this is the level of kind of amazing interview they had

39:38.900 --> 39:42.500
where they're like, don't yell at your kid to go to bed,

39:42.500 --> 39:43.180
I can't wait.

39:43.180 --> 39:44.860
I can't wait for four hours of that.

39:44.860 --> 39:48.100
See, what you got to do is be like, hey kid,

39:48.100 --> 39:50.340
let me tell you about bed, all right?

39:50.340 --> 39:53.420
What you got to do with bed is you get into the bedroom,

39:53.420 --> 39:55.260
you lay in bed, you fall asleep.

39:55.260 --> 39:58.580
If you don't do that, you're going to hell.

39:58.580 --> 40:04.740
If Joe's point is that, like, a parent should explain to a child

40:04.740 --> 40:07.020
who's curious about why there's a bedtime,

40:07.020 --> 40:10.820
why it's healthy and they need to go to bed,

40:10.820 --> 40:14.580
like, if that's the case and he wants to make that equivalent to, like,

40:14.580 --> 40:17.620
social media platforms should be a little bit more transparent,

40:17.620 --> 40:18.860
I'll go with you.

40:18.860 --> 40:21.100
But I also don't think that, like,

40:21.100 --> 40:23.340
I don't think the decisions that have been made are, like,

40:23.340 --> 40:25.460
kicking Alex off, stuff like that.

40:25.460 --> 40:29.260
I don't think that would be overturned by transparency.

40:29.260 --> 40:33.020
Also, I would like to know Alex's take on whether or not

40:33.020 --> 40:35.900
he explains bedtime very clearly.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.060
He's curious.

40:37.060 --> 40:43.380
So we jump to the fourth now, and here's how we open this egg up.

40:43.380 --> 40:47.740
We are 48 days out from the inauguration of Donald John

40:47.740 --> 40:49.580
Trump if we fight back.

40:49.580 --> 40:54.220
The evidence is now red-handed in all five states

40:54.220 --> 40:59.060
with the red-handed video of the illegal sequential ballots.

40:59.060 --> 41:00.380
Devastating.

41:00.380 --> 41:03.420
If Trump can get his hands on those, it's game over.

41:03.420 --> 41:04.140
Game over.

41:04.140 --> 41:06.540
Game over as he can get his hands on them.

41:06.540 --> 41:10.300
But unfortunately, you know, he doesn't have the power of,

41:10.300 --> 41:12.340
like, an entire government behind him.

41:12.340 --> 41:12.940
Nope.

41:12.940 --> 41:13.540
Can't do it.

41:13.540 --> 41:13.980
Can't do it.

41:13.980 --> 41:15.340
Well, I mean, this is all just, like,

41:15.340 --> 41:19.180
I get really bored of a lot of this,

41:19.180 --> 41:22.220
because it's just Alex repeating and amplifying,

41:22.220 --> 41:24.860
like, Rudy Giuliani nonsense.

41:24.860 --> 41:28.180
I just kind of, like, it's exhausting.

41:28.180 --> 41:29.140
It's exhausting.

41:29.140 --> 41:31.100
Go home and bleed your hair dye there.

41:31.100 --> 41:32.380
Alex has big news, though.

41:32.380 --> 41:32.940
What's that?

41:32.940 --> 41:34.060
Well, I have big news.

41:34.060 --> 41:34.540
What's that?

41:34.540 --> 41:36.220
And that is Alex has been reading.

41:36.220 --> 41:38.740
I would like proof.

41:38.740 --> 41:39.660
I would bet that.

41:39.660 --> 41:41.620
Let me give you the big news.

41:41.620 --> 41:43.660
Let me give you the big news here.

41:43.660 --> 41:47.420
I spent hours this morning and hours last night

41:47.420 --> 41:50.180
at Infowars.com and at GatewayPundit.com

41:50.180 --> 41:56.220
and at NationalFile.com and very little time on Breitbart,

41:56.220 --> 41:58.180
because they are really starting to drop the ball

41:58.180 --> 41:59.060
and turn against Trump.

41:59.060 --> 41:59.860
Very disgusting.

41:59.860 --> 42:02.100
But I guess that Mercer money must be good.

42:02.100 --> 42:03.700
Very sad.

42:03.700 --> 42:04.660
I like Breitbart.

42:04.660 --> 42:05.020
Huh.

42:05.020 --> 42:06.940
Think about that a little more, why don't you?

42:06.940 --> 42:09.100
Think about that a little bit more, what you're saying, Alex.

42:09.100 --> 42:10.060
What does it imply?

42:10.060 --> 42:11.500
What does it imply about Breitbart?

42:11.500 --> 42:14.580
What does it imply about?

42:14.580 --> 42:16.660
I think what it implies about Breitbart

42:16.660 --> 42:19.460
is that it only produces content based

42:19.460 --> 42:21.660
upon what billionaires would like.

42:21.660 --> 42:22.340
Huh.

42:22.340 --> 42:23.780
Interesting.

42:23.780 --> 42:26.060
Also, what does that imply about things like Parler,

42:26.060 --> 42:28.420
your social media network that you really

42:28.420 --> 42:31.660
seem to like that has a bunch of Mercer money going to it?

42:31.660 --> 42:33.740
It seems like they would only allow things

42:33.740 --> 42:36.260
that the Mercers would want.

42:36.260 --> 42:40.140
I just think it's best not to use that

42:40.140 --> 42:43.660
as an attack on Breitbart, because they're out of pocket

42:43.660 --> 42:44.740
or whatever.

42:44.740 --> 42:46.180
It's going to be too complicated for you

42:46.180 --> 42:47.500
to thread that needle, Alex.

42:47.500 --> 42:48.060
Don't do it.

42:48.060 --> 42:50.140
I would leave it alone.

42:50.140 --> 42:53.900
That's like following the money in an investigation.

42:53.900 --> 42:56.220
If you follow the money, you're going to get corrupt

42:56.220 --> 42:56.940
politicians.

42:56.940 --> 42:58.940
It's going to happen, because they are.

42:58.940 --> 43:00.260
So don't follow the money.

43:00.260 --> 43:01.900
Well, you know what happens with corrupt politicians?

43:01.900 --> 43:02.420
What's that?

43:02.420 --> 43:05.380
They put ballots in black crates.

43:05.380 --> 43:08.460
And then they count those ballots, corruptly.

43:08.460 --> 43:09.580
Damn them.

43:09.580 --> 43:12.380
One of these stories should turn the whole election over,

43:12.380 --> 43:13.820
because it's so organized.

43:13.820 --> 43:17.300
But there's hundreds with video in dozens

43:17.300 --> 43:19.700
of cases of the fraud.

43:19.700 --> 43:22.460
People looking over their shoulder, kicking everybody

43:22.460 --> 43:24.820
out, saying a water pipe broke.

43:24.820 --> 43:25.780
That's bad enough.

43:25.780 --> 43:26.820
That should overturn it.

43:26.820 --> 43:30.300
Then they pull out all the black crates from under the table

43:30.300 --> 43:32.820
and look like Sylvester when he's caught

43:32.820 --> 43:37.980
with Tweety Bird in his mouth and start

43:37.980 --> 43:39.420
running the sons of bitches.

43:39.420 --> 43:42.020
And then it turns out they're all Biden votes.

43:42.020 --> 43:44.460
So this was a video that Rudy Giuliani had entered

43:44.460 --> 43:46.300
into his evidence as proof of illegal votes

43:46.300 --> 43:49.300
being counted in the Georgia State Farm arena.

43:49.300 --> 43:51.900
It was alleged that these were secret illegal ballots that

43:51.900 --> 43:54.380
were produced from black boxes when no one was looking.

43:54.380 --> 43:54.900
Sure.

43:54.900 --> 43:56.300
The surveillance video was reviewed

43:56.300 --> 43:58.620
by election officials who said that there was literally

43:58.620 --> 44:00.620
nothing abnormal about the video and that these

44:00.620 --> 44:01.860
weren't illegal ballots.

44:01.860 --> 44:06.700
If the material of the box is made of can't be harved,

44:06.700 --> 44:08.340
why not make the ballots out of?

44:08.340 --> 44:11.740
Gabriel Sterling, the voting systems manager in Georgia,

44:11.740 --> 44:14.620
said, quote, the 90-second video of election workers

44:14.620 --> 44:16.740
at State Farm arena purporting to show fraud

44:16.740 --> 44:19.700
was watched in its entirety, hours of footage,

44:19.700 --> 44:22.660
not just the 90 seconds, by Georgia Secretary of State

44:22.660 --> 44:26.260
investigators, shows normal ballot processing.

44:26.260 --> 44:27.420
Oh, damn them.

44:27.420 --> 44:29.060
Once again, we have Trump's goons

44:29.060 --> 44:31.300
trying to manufacture a voter fraud narrative out

44:31.300 --> 44:33.460
of the appearance of something that they think looks

44:33.460 --> 44:34.540
suspicious.

44:34.540 --> 44:36.780
The fact that they keep doing this and each time it

44:36.780 --> 44:39.420
turns out to be nothing should make his followers wary

44:39.420 --> 44:43.580
the next time Rudy or Alex find some supposed irregularity.

44:43.580 --> 44:46.100
But some people fall from multiple doomsday

44:46.100 --> 44:48.380
predictions, so there's no telling.

44:48.380 --> 44:49.340
Yeah.

44:49.340 --> 44:53.460
The end of the earth is on December 21, 2012.

44:53.460 --> 44:54.940
OK, December 21.

44:54.940 --> 44:56.100
I got it wrong.

44:56.100 --> 44:59.820
It's on December 21, 200, 2100.

44:59.820 --> 45:02.940
So guys, come on, follow me for the next 100 years or so.

45:02.940 --> 45:03.740
We'll be all right.

45:03.740 --> 45:04.580
Yeah.

45:04.580 --> 45:06.700
It's just, it's exhausting.

45:06.700 --> 45:13.340
And I think that these are thin and I just, I don't know.

45:13.340 --> 45:17.340
I lose my patience with covering the same topic

45:17.340 --> 45:18.780
over and over again.

45:18.780 --> 45:22.540
So I was very excited to hear this.

45:22.540 --> 45:25.180
I don't know if it's true that La Cosa Nostra, the mafia,

45:25.180 --> 45:29.020
had Jagger Hoover dressed up like a woman.

45:29.020 --> 45:30.100
I don't know if he was gay.

45:30.100 --> 45:31.500
I really don't care.

45:31.500 --> 45:36.260
The point is, is that he did say that the mafia did not exist.

45:36.260 --> 45:37.820
OK?

45:37.820 --> 45:41.740
He gave testimony in the 40s and early 50s

45:41.740 --> 45:45.780
that the mafia did not exist.

45:45.780 --> 45:46.500
OK?

45:46.500 --> 45:48.020
The reason that Jagger Hoover was

45:48.020 --> 45:50.340
in denial about the existence of the mafia was that,

45:50.340 --> 45:52.140
at the time, the FBI was basically

45:52.140 --> 45:53.780
entirely focused on investigating

45:53.780 --> 45:56.300
alleged communists and surveilling left wing

45:56.300 --> 45:56.860
activists.

45:56.860 --> 45:57.460
Yeah.

45:57.460 --> 45:59.340
He didn't see going after mafia actors

45:59.340 --> 46:02.060
as a good use of resources, since organized crime could

46:02.060 --> 46:03.980
be difficult to prosecute.

46:03.980 --> 46:06.460
And they were rich, so they could bribe people.

46:06.460 --> 46:08.500
They gave people a lot of money, which is,

46:08.500 --> 46:09.580
that was one of their.

46:09.580 --> 46:10.420
Following the money.

46:10.420 --> 46:11.820
No, that was a good idea.

46:11.820 --> 46:13.260
You give people money if you want

46:13.260 --> 46:15.020
them to investigate leftists.

46:15.020 --> 46:15.700
Yeah.

46:15.700 --> 46:18.060
If Alex had been around in 1955, he

46:18.060 --> 46:20.620
would have been enthusiastically supporting the FBI,

46:20.620 --> 46:22.300
leaving the mafia alone, saying they're just

46:22.300 --> 46:23.820
good Americana businessmen.

46:23.820 --> 46:26.140
What are you, hate Italians now?

46:26.140 --> 46:27.020
Come on!

46:27.020 --> 46:29.740
The FBI had bigger issues, like how literally everyone

46:29.740 --> 46:31.180
I don't like is a communist.

46:31.180 --> 46:32.940
That's what you've got to be spending your time on.

46:32.940 --> 46:35.580
These good, God-fearing Catholics over here,

46:35.580 --> 46:38.300
just trying to make a living in the new world,

46:38.300 --> 46:40.540
and you're going to ignore them, and you're

46:40.540 --> 46:41.700
going to go after the commies.

46:41.700 --> 46:42.780
That's what you do.

46:42.780 --> 46:43.700
That's more or less.

46:43.700 --> 46:44.580
That's the way you do it.

46:44.580 --> 46:46.460
So Alex is like, you know, he's sitting here,

46:46.460 --> 46:48.220
he's talking about these globalists.

46:48.220 --> 46:49.020
They're a menace.

46:49.020 --> 46:50.740
They want to depopulate everybody.

46:50.740 --> 46:52.380
They want to kill off the entire world.

46:52.380 --> 46:54.380
So does he, though.

46:54.380 --> 46:58.300
But the globalists, they seem to have like a gun to their head.

46:58.300 --> 46:59.820
But it's an alien gun.

46:59.820 --> 47:00.340
Ooh.

47:00.340 --> 47:01.620
But Alex is talking about this, and he

47:01.620 --> 47:02.780
realizes this sounds silly.

47:02.780 --> 47:04.340
Is that more dangerous than a?

47:04.340 --> 47:04.860
Yes.

47:04.860 --> 47:05.380
Oh, OK.

47:05.380 --> 47:07.380
Far more dangerous.

47:07.380 --> 47:08.220
Absolutely.

47:08.220 --> 47:09.140
But it's at your head.

47:09.140 --> 47:11.460
Yeah, but it's, I mean, look.

47:11.460 --> 47:13.380
You could survive a gunshot to your head

47:13.380 --> 47:16.620
if it went just the, not an alien gun.

47:16.620 --> 47:17.660
An alien will blow you up.

47:17.660 --> 47:18.180
Oh, totally.

47:18.180 --> 47:18.700
OK, OK.

47:18.700 --> 47:20.100
So anyway, he realizes this sounds

47:20.100 --> 47:22.140
a little silly in the middle.

47:22.140 --> 47:24.060
This is like a kamikaze action.

47:24.060 --> 47:27.860
It's like somebody's got a gun to these people's heads.

47:27.860 --> 47:31.100
You will depopulate your planet, or we will destroy it all.

47:31.100 --> 47:31.700
Hey, Marvin.

47:31.700 --> 47:35.460
I mean, if I was a military tactician, I'd say,

47:35.460 --> 47:36.460
this doesn't make sense.

47:36.460 --> 47:38.900
It's like aliens have a gun to their heads to do this.

47:38.900 --> 47:39.700
This is not going to be popular.

47:39.700 --> 47:40.980
If I was a military tactician.

47:40.980 --> 47:42.420
It doesn't help people.

47:42.420 --> 47:44.020
And I'm not even saying it's aliens.

47:44.020 --> 47:48.020
I'm saying the Bible says it's an alien.

47:48.020 --> 47:48.740
OK.

47:48.740 --> 47:52.540
Colonel, Colonel, I just, we can't figure out why.

47:52.540 --> 47:55.460
I'm pretty sure that aliens have a gun to their head.

47:55.460 --> 47:56.660
It's got to be an alien gun.

47:56.660 --> 47:57.940
It's got to be alien guns.

47:57.940 --> 48:02.500
I just grow so tired of trying to save face by being like,

48:02.500 --> 48:04.820
I'm not saying aliens, but the Bible says it's an alien.

48:04.820 --> 48:06.500
Yeah, the Bible says it.

48:06.500 --> 48:09.140
You're saying it's an alien.

48:09.140 --> 48:09.940
Cut it out.

48:09.940 --> 48:11.460
You believe everything the Bible says,

48:11.460 --> 48:12.980
so if the Bible says it's an alien,

48:12.980 --> 48:14.100
you're saying it's an alien.

48:14.100 --> 48:14.500
Right.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.540
That's the next question I would like to ask him.

48:16.540 --> 48:19.380
If you were to present this in my presence, I would say,

48:19.380 --> 48:20.660
so you're saying it's an alien.

48:20.660 --> 48:22.220
And he would say, no, I'm not saying I'm just saying

48:22.220 --> 48:22.820
the Bible says it's an alien.

48:22.820 --> 48:23.820
So you don't believe the Bible.

48:23.820 --> 48:24.420
Exactly.

48:24.420 --> 48:25.820
That would be the next question.

48:25.820 --> 48:27.940
And he'd be like, oh, well, blah, blah, blah.

48:27.940 --> 48:28.900
So it's an alien.

48:28.900 --> 48:30.460
Wow, the Bible says it's an alien.

48:30.460 --> 48:31.620
So you don't believe the Bible.

48:31.620 --> 48:33.100
Look, I'm not saying it's an alien.

48:33.100 --> 48:33.740
I'm just saying.

48:33.740 --> 48:35.380
I'm starting to feel like we could do this for a while.

48:35.380 --> 48:37.460
Yeah.

48:37.460 --> 48:39.580
So yeah, Alex's enemies, they have an alien gun

48:39.580 --> 48:42.020
to their head, but they're also the people

48:42.020 --> 48:44.260
who James Bond villains are based on.

48:44.260 --> 48:45.300
I don't know if you know that.

48:45.300 --> 48:45.900
The aliens?

48:45.900 --> 48:49.420
They all look like Dr. Evil.

48:49.420 --> 48:51.180
Why does Dr. Evil look like that?

48:51.180 --> 48:54.180
Because Hollywood knows these people look like.

48:54.180 --> 48:55.260
Or?

48:55.260 --> 48:57.820
Where's his mini me?

48:57.820 --> 48:59.820
Well, that one is actually an interesting story.

48:59.820 --> 49:01.740
Have you ever seen the island of Dr. Moreau?

49:01.740 --> 49:02.740
You're going to take it.

49:02.740 --> 49:05.220
You're going to drink sewage and eat weeds.

49:05.220 --> 49:06.300
He said that last week.

49:06.300 --> 49:06.820
Val Buehler.

49:06.820 --> 49:09.660
The whole diet will be sewage, bugs, and weeds.

49:09.660 --> 49:10.340
I'm not kidding.

49:10.340 --> 49:11.060
He had the club.

49:11.060 --> 49:11.900
See Marlon Brando.

49:11.900 --> 49:12.660
This is in German.

49:15.300 --> 49:17.900
They're going to do a diet to drink sewage and weeds.

49:17.900 --> 49:19.460
The director actually went crazy.

49:19.460 --> 49:20.500
It's a really interesting movie.

49:20.500 --> 49:22.220
But don't worry, your tampons will be free.

49:22.220 --> 49:23.340
He actually said that, too.

49:23.340 --> 49:25.660
I mean, yes.

49:25.660 --> 49:29.100
So that's Goldfinger.

49:29.100 --> 49:30.940
He's more of a corrupt industrialist.

49:30.940 --> 49:34.700
Pull up Adam Spector in From Russia With Love.

49:34.700 --> 49:35.980
I'll never even show his face.

49:35.980 --> 49:37.500
But just pull up James Bond.

49:37.500 --> 49:39.620
Pull up Dr. Evil.

49:39.620 --> 49:42.020
I got to digress here.

49:42.020 --> 49:43.740
If you don't fund our operation, if you

49:43.740 --> 49:45.460
don't do your Christmas shopping with us,

49:45.460 --> 49:47.740
we're not funded by Paul Schwab.

49:47.740 --> 49:53.620
Certainly, if you want more content like this,

49:53.620 --> 49:55.420
please give us money.

49:58.620 --> 50:00.500
All right, we have breaking news.

50:00.500 --> 50:00.980
Hold on.

50:00.980 --> 50:01.500
Hold on.

50:01.500 --> 50:03.500
That guy looks a little bit like Blofeld.

50:03.500 --> 50:05.980
Can we pull up some Blofeld?

50:05.980 --> 50:07.260
Yeah, I know I'm Wolf Plisser.

50:07.260 --> 50:08.700
Can we pull up Blofeld?

50:08.700 --> 50:10.020
Sure, it's breaking news.

50:10.020 --> 50:13.180
Pull up Blofeld!

50:13.180 --> 50:15.220
My enemies look like James Bond villains.

50:15.220 --> 50:17.220
Not that one.

50:17.220 --> 50:17.860
The other one.

50:17.860 --> 50:18.380
The other one.

50:18.380 --> 50:19.460
Let's get a picture of it.

50:19.460 --> 50:21.180
What about Mini-Me?

50:21.180 --> 50:21.660
No.

50:21.660 --> 50:23.180
You will eat sewage.

50:23.180 --> 50:24.300
They look like Dr. Evil.

50:24.300 --> 50:24.660
You know what?

50:24.660 --> 50:25.860
Just pull up Dr. Evil.

50:25.860 --> 50:26.540
That makes sense.

50:26.540 --> 50:30.180
I'm doing this great impression of sewage man.

50:30.180 --> 50:31.180
Look, we need your money.

50:31.180 --> 50:31.700
Well.

50:34.700 --> 50:35.820
So that was bad.

50:35.820 --> 50:39.420
I was like, oh, that's just a tragic ad pivot.

50:39.420 --> 50:40.620
But then it gets even worse.

50:40.620 --> 50:42.820
Because Alex is talking about this prostiguard

50:42.820 --> 50:43.780
that's back in stock.

50:43.780 --> 50:44.180
Sure.

50:44.180 --> 50:45.580
I think he might be fucking around

50:45.580 --> 50:46.940
and getting himself sued again.

50:46.940 --> 50:48.340
Good.

50:48.340 --> 50:50.580
And the Saw Palmetto is great for women, too.

50:50.580 --> 50:54.060
It's just been found that the FDA has had to admit that, OK,

50:54.060 --> 50:56.460
medical doctors should prescribe Saw Palmetto

50:56.460 --> 50:58.620
as a regular daily regimen for your prostate.

50:58.620 --> 51:01.500
Because it literally just basically 99% chance

51:01.500 --> 51:02.740
it stops the cancer.

51:02.740 --> 51:03.420
Depending on the study, you look like it's very high numbers.

51:03.420 --> 51:04.700
Wait, what did you just say?

51:04.700 --> 51:05.580
What did you just say?

51:05.580 --> 51:05.900
Well, I'm not advertising it.

51:05.900 --> 51:06.380
Hold up.

51:06.380 --> 51:10.660
I'm advertising it as essential vitamin and minerals for you.

51:10.660 --> 51:11.420
Sir, excuse me.

51:11.420 --> 51:13.420
So what's great about that is that part at the end where

51:13.420 --> 51:14.740
he's like, I'm not advertising it as that.

51:14.740 --> 51:15.100
No.

51:15.100 --> 51:15.620
No, no, no.

51:15.620 --> 51:18.100
I am mentioning that in the middle of a sales pitch.

51:18.100 --> 51:19.620
Well, there's that.

51:19.620 --> 51:24.580
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

51:24.580 --> 51:27.620
99% chance you won't get prostate cancer

51:27.620 --> 51:29.660
if you take Saw Palmetto.

51:29.660 --> 51:30.620
Wow.

51:30.620 --> 51:34.180
And is it a legal defense whenever they're like, OK,

51:34.180 --> 51:34.940
well, you said this.

51:34.940 --> 51:36.180
And he's like, no, no, no, no.

51:36.180 --> 51:37.460
I put JK at the end.

51:37.460 --> 51:38.620
See?

51:38.620 --> 51:39.300
I don't know.

51:39.300 --> 51:40.300
I think that's illegal.

51:40.300 --> 51:40.700
Yeah.

51:40.700 --> 51:44.180
Anyway, Alex starts talking about Biden, right?

51:44.180 --> 51:44.700
Mm-hmm.

51:44.700 --> 51:45.980
He doesn't have to worry about Biden.

51:45.980 --> 51:46.500
OK, good.

51:46.500 --> 51:49.220
Because what you really have to worry about is Kamala Harris.

51:49.220 --> 51:49.540
OK.

51:49.540 --> 51:51.260
Because she's actually going to be the president.

51:51.260 --> 51:52.460
I thought it was because she's a woman

51:52.460 --> 51:54.140
and they're far more threatened by women,

51:54.140 --> 51:57.020
especially a woman of color than they are of white men.

51:57.020 --> 52:00.260
I think that if you really got granular with it

52:00.260 --> 52:02.540
and you got Alex into a psychiatrist's office,

52:02.540 --> 52:04.580
psychologist's office, maybe this is something

52:04.580 --> 52:06.420
that you could tease out eventually.

52:06.420 --> 52:07.060
Right.

52:07.060 --> 52:09.620
But no, on the surface, it's because Biden is just

52:09.620 --> 52:12.740
going to let Kamala be president, basically.

52:12.740 --> 52:13.380
Oh.

52:13.380 --> 52:16.140
And he says so much in a clip that Alex plays.

52:16.140 --> 52:18.060
Since I mentioned it, because it's too insane

52:18.060 --> 52:20.340
to just say it and not play the clip, where

52:20.340 --> 52:21.620
he talks about stepping down.

52:21.620 --> 52:23.740
If he doesn't do what Kamala says, here it is.

52:23.740 --> 52:24.780
All kidding aside.

52:24.780 --> 52:27.180
The first lady to be told me she holds them for you.

52:27.180 --> 52:28.340
Yes, she does.

52:28.340 --> 52:31.860
But not because she and Kamala have become friends.

52:31.860 --> 52:35.980
But all kidding aside, it's a matter of the thing

52:35.980 --> 52:39.940
we are simpatico on our philosophy of government

52:39.940 --> 52:43.460
and simpatico on how we want to attach, approach these issues

52:43.460 --> 52:44.500
that we're facing.

52:44.500 --> 52:46.020
And so I don't have any.

52:46.020 --> 52:48.340
When we disagree, it'll be just like so far,

52:48.340 --> 52:50.340
it's been just like Barack and I did.

52:50.340 --> 52:51.180
It's in private.

52:51.180 --> 52:53.660
She'll say, I think we should do A, B, C, or D.

52:53.660 --> 52:58.420
And I'll say, I like A, I don't like B and C. And it's OK.

52:58.420 --> 53:01.740
And like I told Barack, if I reach something

53:01.740 --> 53:04.580
where there's a fundamental disagreement we

53:04.580 --> 53:09.140
have based on a moral principle, I'll

53:09.140 --> 53:12.700
develop some disease and say I have to resign.

53:12.700 --> 53:14.140
We don't have that.

53:14.140 --> 53:14.900
We haven't.

53:14.900 --> 53:17.700
And we discussed at length our views

53:17.700 --> 53:20.820
on foreign policy, on domestic policy, on intelligence.

53:20.820 --> 53:22.660
And the great thing is she has a background.

53:22.660 --> 53:26.300
Look at these two disingenuous, slimy frogs

53:26.300 --> 53:27.860
that know they've stolen this.

53:27.860 --> 53:28.860
OK.

53:28.860 --> 53:29.580
All right.

53:29.580 --> 53:32.420
I don't think that that clip says what Alex thinks it does.

53:32.420 --> 53:33.820
OK, so what we're going to do.

53:33.820 --> 53:37.900
I think he's saying that when he was Obama's vice president,

53:37.900 --> 53:40.700
they had sort of private disagreements

53:40.700 --> 53:42.700
over minor issues.

53:42.700 --> 53:46.060
And if there was a really substantial thing,

53:46.060 --> 53:50.100
that he would gracefully bow out in a way that

53:50.100 --> 53:53.540
wouldn't cause psychological damage to the country.

53:53.540 --> 53:56.900
That is not saying that if he disagrees with Kamala Harris

53:56.900 --> 54:00.540
on substantial issues, he'll fake an injury

54:00.540 --> 54:02.180
and then she'll become president.

54:02.180 --> 54:06.380
When I was vice president and I didn't

54:06.380 --> 54:10.540
have any actual say over what the final decision was,

54:10.540 --> 54:11.780
I would give my input.

54:11.780 --> 54:14.820
And if I found the final decision unacceptable,

54:14.820 --> 54:16.420
I would not throw a tantrum.

54:16.420 --> 54:18.660
I would be like, I can't do this.

54:18.660 --> 54:19.580
I broke my foot.

54:19.580 --> 54:20.900
I'm no longer vice president.

54:20.900 --> 54:21.900
That's what he's saying.

54:21.900 --> 54:27.740
Yeah, he's, I find that to be an incredibly mature position.

54:27.740 --> 54:32.540
That like, yeah, I would assume that what

54:32.540 --> 54:36.500
is being discussed there, if you want

54:36.500 --> 54:40.460
to apply it to the president, it would be Harris will step down

54:40.460 --> 54:45.260
if there is a fundamental disagreement between them.

54:45.260 --> 54:47.340
That's pretty much what he's saying.

54:47.340 --> 54:50.300
If we were, because he wasn't president before.

54:50.300 --> 54:56.700
So his story isn't based on when he was president.

54:56.700 --> 54:57.540
What a dick.

54:57.540 --> 54:58.100
Yep.

54:58.100 --> 55:03.100
Speaking of dicks, somebody who's a real pile of shit,

55:03.100 --> 55:06.780
somebody who's, I can't stand, his voice is so annoying.

55:06.780 --> 55:10.420
Oh god, Tom Papert, the National File is back.

55:10.420 --> 55:12.580
And he's pitching this conspiracy

55:12.580 --> 55:15.900
where this woman and her daughter in Georgia

55:15.900 --> 55:20.580
were like, you know, they switched ballots and stuff.

55:20.580 --> 55:22.260
And like, he's going to fuck around and get.

55:22.260 --> 55:24.460
Like in a Freaky Friday situation,

55:24.460 --> 55:26.620
it was like a magical evening and they

55:26.620 --> 55:28.300
touched it in front of a fountain.

55:28.300 --> 55:30.100
I don't care about what's going on.

55:30.100 --> 55:31.660
They have not presented evidence that

55:31.660 --> 55:33.460
rises to any level of suspicion.

55:33.460 --> 55:34.020
There's that.

55:34.020 --> 55:36.580
It is just like, I'm only going to play this clip

55:36.580 --> 55:38.740
because these dudes are trying to get people killed.

55:38.740 --> 55:39.340
Yeah.

55:39.340 --> 55:41.140
You see the four or five people in the video

55:41.140 --> 55:44.060
and everybody's wondering, well, who the heck are these people?

55:44.060 --> 55:46.380
Well, now we know, thanks to the very good reporting

55:46.380 --> 55:49.460
of the Gateway Pundit, it's the mother, a woman named

55:49.460 --> 55:51.380
Ruby Freeman, and her daughter.

55:51.380 --> 55:54.060
Her daughter, she says in a Facebook video,

55:54.060 --> 55:57.340
is her supervisor while she works on the election.

55:57.340 --> 55:59.180
She talks about people complaining

55:59.180 --> 56:01.340
because her supervisor is giving out

56:01.340 --> 56:03.340
instructions that don't make sense

56:03.340 --> 56:04.820
and seem to be against the law.

56:04.820 --> 56:06.500
She says, well, that's just how it is.

56:06.500 --> 56:08.340
That's my supervisor.

56:08.340 --> 56:11.220
She makes it very clear that her daughter is calling the shots.

56:11.220 --> 56:15.380
Well, Alex, her daughter happens to have long blonde dreadlocks

56:15.380 --> 56:18.980
that in a grainy security camera look a lot like braids.

56:18.980 --> 56:21.900
Her daughter is the woman who at 8.22 in the morning

56:21.900 --> 56:25.580
on election day brought in these suitcases full of ballots.

56:25.580 --> 56:29.380
And then once everybody was gone because of the leaky toilets

56:29.380 --> 56:31.340
on that night, she is the one who

56:31.340 --> 56:34.020
started removing the suitcases from underneath the table

56:34.020 --> 56:37.300
and counting them and ordering the other people to count them.

56:37.300 --> 56:41.500
This is an elaborate conspiracy that he is directly

56:41.500 --> 56:43.540
accusing people of.

56:43.540 --> 56:44.660
And by name.

56:44.660 --> 56:48.380
Yeah, and by name, I think that if these two people,

56:48.380 --> 56:50.660
this mother and daughter, feel so inclined,

56:50.660 --> 56:53.020
I think they should probably sue Tom Papert.

56:53.020 --> 56:54.220
This is outrageous.

56:54.220 --> 56:54.940
100%.

56:54.940 --> 56:56.660
Because of the consequences.

56:56.660 --> 56:59.300
I mean, granted, it'd probably take a lot of time.

56:59.300 --> 57:02.380
It would be unnecessarily difficult and a pain

57:02.380 --> 57:03.300
in the ass.

57:03.300 --> 57:06.300
But the potential consequences of the actions

57:06.300 --> 57:08.780
that people like Alex and Tom are doing right here

57:08.780 --> 57:12.460
are so severe that they deserve some sort

57:12.460 --> 57:14.020
of a consequence for it.

57:14.020 --> 57:17.900
And I just can't believe they would do this kind of thing

57:17.900 --> 57:18.540
to people.

57:18.540 --> 57:19.140
I can.

57:19.140 --> 57:19.940
Yeah, I guess I can.

57:19.940 --> 57:23.780
I mean, they just have such a bloodlust.

57:23.780 --> 57:24.900
They just really do.

57:24.900 --> 57:28.140
Like a literal, like, not only are we

57:28.140 --> 57:30.700
saying this person's name hoping they get death threats,

57:30.700 --> 57:34.140
like, this is what we want.

57:34.140 --> 57:37.100
And it's just so fucked.

57:37.100 --> 57:38.500
Yeah, it's tough.

57:38.500 --> 57:40.340
Oh, there's that stranger over there

57:40.340 --> 57:43.140
who I'm going to exploit and maybe get killed.

57:43.140 --> 57:43.820
The end.

57:43.820 --> 57:48.220
So anyway, Tom is on with, he's much rosier than Alex

57:48.220 --> 57:49.180
in a lot of ways.

57:49.180 --> 57:50.900
He's basically convinced that Trump

57:50.900 --> 57:53.460
is going to win these cases, and then he's

57:53.460 --> 57:54.900
going to become president again.

57:54.900 --> 57:57.140
So really what I should have said upfront when you came on,

57:57.140 --> 57:59.860
the big news is not just all the smoking gun evidence now,

57:59.860 --> 58:01.820
but also the legislatures are starting

58:01.820 --> 58:03.900
to move in the right direction.

58:03.900 --> 58:04.940
That's exactly right.

58:04.940 --> 58:08.220
And these people, Alex, these are the modern revolutionaries.

58:08.220 --> 58:10.140
These are the new founding fathers.

58:10.140 --> 58:12.740
These legislatures, the state legislatures

58:12.740 --> 58:15.220
are the new founding fathers of a new country that's

58:15.220 --> 58:16.540
going to be under Trump.

58:16.540 --> 58:19.020
Now, admittedly, many of these state legislatures

58:19.020 --> 58:22.780
have also been in agreement with the whole lockdown and COVID

58:22.780 --> 58:23.260
stuff.

58:23.260 --> 58:26.100
And so after this one, we're going

58:26.100 --> 58:27.940
to go back to tearing down their homes.

58:27.940 --> 58:32.900
But for now, get into Trump, and then we'll fuck you up.

58:32.900 --> 58:33.580
Yeah.

58:33.580 --> 58:35.060
I mean, there is no loyalty.

58:35.060 --> 58:37.100
There's no consistency.

58:37.100 --> 58:40.260
And it's never more clearly embodied

58:40.260 --> 58:42.780
than when they start talking about Attorney General William

58:42.780 --> 58:43.860
Barr.

58:43.860 --> 58:46.660
As we know, he was someone who was not

58:46.660 --> 58:47.980
to be trusted at the beginning.

58:47.980 --> 58:49.300
Ooh, bad.

58:49.300 --> 58:51.500
Because he was associated with the Bushes.

58:51.500 --> 58:53.700
H.W. Bush pardoned all those people.

58:53.700 --> 58:54.580
Uh-huh.

58:54.580 --> 58:59.220
And then he started to get real creepy and super accommodating

58:59.220 --> 59:00.340
of some of Trump's BS.

59:00.340 --> 59:01.420
Yeah, because he's a hero.

59:01.420 --> 59:03.220
And then, yeah, he became a hero.

59:03.220 --> 59:04.940
He's one of the good guys.

59:04.940 --> 59:06.780
And then he got out of pocket a little bit,

59:06.780 --> 59:08.300
did some stuff that Alex didn't like.

59:08.300 --> 59:09.660
I always knew he was a monster.

59:09.660 --> 59:10.160
Yeah.

59:10.160 --> 59:12.940
And then he said some really, really fucked up stuff.

59:12.940 --> 59:14.020
That's because he's a hero.

59:14.020 --> 59:14.700
Right.

59:14.700 --> 59:16.060
And so now he's a villain again.

59:16.060 --> 59:16.860
Oh, he's a monster.

59:16.860 --> 59:19.940
Barr coming out was a reserve army.

59:19.940 --> 59:22.260
We know he's been a deep state double agent at least.

59:22.260 --> 59:24.700
But the fact that he came out against Trump a few days ago

59:24.700 --> 59:27.340
showed their total desperation.

59:27.340 --> 59:30.380
That was their emergency get out of jail free card

59:30.380 --> 59:33.060
and ain't working.

59:33.060 --> 59:34.100
Well, that's exactly right.

59:34.100 --> 59:36.140
I mean, you described Barr perfectly there.

59:36.140 --> 59:37.380
I've never quite thought about it that way.

59:37.380 --> 59:38.180
But that's correct.

59:38.180 --> 59:40.380
I mean, Barr's father hired Jeffrey Epstein

59:40.380 --> 59:42.580
to teach at a girls' school when nobody else would.

59:42.580 --> 59:44.060
That's who Barr's family is.

59:44.060 --> 59:45.660
So it makes perfect sense that he's

59:45.660 --> 59:47.900
in the sleeper with a significant amount of Trump

59:47.900 --> 59:50.180
supporters saying, oh, he plays the bagpipes.

59:50.180 --> 59:50.900
I love him.

59:50.900 --> 59:53.300
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

59:53.300 --> 59:54.180
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

59:54.180 --> 59:57.940
I mean, like the tone of his voice, I can't stand it.

59:57.940 --> 59:58.740
No, it's terrible.

59:58.740 --> 01:00:00.060
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.740
It's morning radio-y.

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:03.180
It's just obnoxious.

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.020
It's terrible.

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:04.500
Yeah.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.620
I almost said bingo because that is something that you literally

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.220
said that to me last week.

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:12.880
I wonder how long it's going to take for him to remember

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.820
the Epstein stuff.

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:14.300
Yeah.

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.380
Exactly this long.

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:17.740
The second I read the headline that Barr

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:21.220
said that there wasn't evidence of widespread voter fraud,

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.220
I texted you, well, looks like Alex

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.460
is about to remember that Barr's a villain again.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:26.340
Yep, yep.

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.660
It's just so sad.

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.180
It's predictable as shit.

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:29.820
Yeah.

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:33.620
So in this next clip, Tom has broken the case

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:37.580
on what's going on with voting.

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.420
And I think he does.

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:39.680
Tom has broken the case.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.980
I think he doesn't know how voting works.

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.020
I agree.

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.600
And I have a potential idea of how this may have

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.620
happened after examining Georgia.

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:49.420
So I talked to an election expert last night

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:50.860
who testified yesterday.

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.820
He said that what they found is they're

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:55.500
using homeless shelters in downtown Atlanta

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.660
and other Democrat strongholds to register thousands of people.

01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:02.260
And mental institutions and nursing homes.

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:04.980
Which, by the way, seems to be a thing that experts have not

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:06.100
weighed in, meaning the lawyers.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.640
But that seems to be a clear and obvious violation of the law.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.020
You cannot have 2,000 people like Alex.

01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.780
You can't just walk into a homeless shelter

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:14.100
and say, I'm here to register to vote.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:15.500
I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.060
Yes, you can.

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.860
So I think these people have been older than we have.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:18.740
I mean, we know that.

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:21.700
And it's a literal legal thing that you can do.

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:24.060
Does he think that people experiencing homelessness

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:24.620
can't vote?

01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:26.700
They don't get to vote because they don't have homes.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.780
Does he think that people without permanent addresses

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:29.460
can't vote?

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.420
They don't own property.

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.860
Only property holding white men are allowed to vote, Dan.

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:33.700
Didn't you know that?

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:36.700
Do you think that people in residential care can't vote?

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:38.240
Like Alex is saying they're registering

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.380
people in nursing homes.

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:40.260
Yeah.

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:42.140
You know those people have a right to vote.

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:43.460
Since when?

01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:44.140
Always.

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:45.660
Oh.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.580
Why you?

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:50.500
I mean, obviously.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.420
I think it's a little transparent, but.

01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:53.420
It's a little bit like.

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:56.540
It's remarkable the sort of the lack of grasp

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.900
on any kind of civics there.

01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:58.860
Like just, oh, yeah.

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:01.020
Oh, yeah, obviously, if you're experiencing homelessness,

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.060
you can't vote.

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:02.980
Oh, yeah, you saw.

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.340
Why would you let those people vote?

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:07.660
That's how they think.

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:09.220
That is exactly how they think.

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:09.780
Yep.

01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:13.620
So Tom leaves, and Alex has a big piece

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:17.500
of news about social media, big tech.

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.580
Oh, is he getting back on?

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:19.600
No.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.500
There's another really big story that I haven't gotten to,

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:28.180
and I really, really need to get to it.

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:31.260
And it deals with the next level that

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:35.980
is now here of censorship.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:38.260
And it deals with YouTube saying they're

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:42.940
going to, quote, suppress the videos of white males

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:44.620
and not let them trend.

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:45.460
Wow.

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:46.740
Wow, indeed.

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:47.780
That is a huge wow.

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:49.820
I would imagine if they came out and said that,

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:51.820
there would be a large outcry.

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:54.020
So since he's saying that they did say that,

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.660
and I haven't heard about it, I suppose

01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:58.020
they're suppressing the news of their suppression?

01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:58.820
That might be.

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:01.140
That might be it, because Alex is dead serious.

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:01.980
OK.

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.820
They're going to discriminate because someone

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:07.340
has white skin and is male.

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:10.900
So now, just because you're white,

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.420
you're not going to be able to trend.

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.620
Quote Martin Luther King Jr. Do it.

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:16.260
I fucking dare you.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.980
By the way, I'm not joking.

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:22.220
It actually says, we will suppress white males.

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:24.180
Ladies and gentlemen, what is that meant to do?

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.380
It's meant to create total racial division.

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:28.540
So I found the article about this on Infowars,

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:31.140
and it's just about YouTube responding to their creators,

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.640
who have noted that there seems to be

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:35.060
a bias in the algorithmic boosting of videos

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:37.100
and channels of white creators.

01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:40.460
In response, they ask creators to voluntarily provide

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:42.260
information about their identity, which

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.340
could be used to help better track and see

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:47.540
if there is an actual underlying bias in their algorithm

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:49.060
that they can find a way to mitigate.

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:49.540
Sure.

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:52.460
As it stands now, there's really no way for them to test that,

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:54.940
because they have no data on the identities of the creators.

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:56.500
So this would be a way that they could

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.860
try to solve that problem that their users have

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.780
requested they look into.

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:03.100
Alex is just making up all the details of the story,

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:05.620
including that quote about not letting white males trend.

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:05.940
Yeah.

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.020
This is all just him trying to scare his audience,

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:10.420
because they're super into white identity fear.

01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:11.700
Hey, YouTube.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:12.740
A lot of white dudes.

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:13.740
Look into it.

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:14.540
OK.

01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:20.820
So I just find this to be sad.

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:21.620
Yeah.

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:22.140
Yeah.

01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.980
It's not.

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.140
White men really going hard now, but they're

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:30.260
so desperate with their bullshit, it's real pathetic.

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:32.400
Well, the problem that I have is that this

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.740
is so easy to understand what the actual story is

01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:38.500
on YouTube's side of things.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.660
And Alex seems like he should have bigger issues right now.

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.860
Like, there's this whole election fraud thing.

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:47.060
There's the vaccines and the COVID and all this.

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:51.180
Do you really need to try and stoke white fear out of the end?

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.780
And the answer is yes.

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:53.260
Yeah.

01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:54.820
Because that's his bread and butter.

01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:55.460
Sure.

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:58.260
That's something that's so important to keeping

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:02.140
the audience engaged, keeping them interested.

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:05.740
It is interesting that you can hammer one story.

01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:08.380
You can hit, oh, voter fraud, voter fraud, voter fraud,

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:09.700
voter fraud, voter fraud.

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.340
But with white identity stuff, you've

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:14.700
always got to provide more and more new examples each time.

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:17.020
Otherwise, people are like, wow, that's the only reason

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.700
they're, or that's the only thing they're

01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:20.300
oppressing white men about.

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:23.180
You have to make up some new bullshit all the time.

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:25.340
Yeah, and just misrepresent all sorts of shit.

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:26.020
Yep.

01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:27.980
So Alex doesn't want to kill people,

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:29.780
although he has said that he's killed people

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:30.660
a bunch in the past.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.540
And that he liked it.

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:32.460
Yeah.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:36.780
And look, I don't want to start going around and killing

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:38.380
people, OK?

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.860
But I'm just telling everybody something.

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.220
We have a duty to not put up with this

01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:45.340
and to get in these people's faces and say, look,

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:46.860
you may think there's too many people.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.340
And in some areas, there probably are.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.460
And there's some problems.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.340
But man, come on.

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:50.740
Wait, what?

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.540
He's talking about the vaccine because he

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:53.860
thinks it's a depopulation thing.

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:54.900
Oh, I got you.

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:57.260
So he doesn't want to go around and kill people,

01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:00.660
but they're going to have a vaccine, right?

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:03.500
So much like Joe Rogan explaining bedtime

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:06.700
to his child, you are meant to go to globalists

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:09.580
and say, hey, look, I know you think there are too many

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:13.220
people, but how about don't kill them?

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:17.140
I guess in this example, Alex is going to kill his kid

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.140
if he doesn't go to bed.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.420
It does seem like he's going to walk around killing children

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:22.700
who don't do what he says.

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:25.260
Yeah, he'll become a legend of folklore, the guy who

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:27.700
kills you if you don't go to bed.

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:30.140
You'll be used to terrified children for generations.

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:33.500
Into your mirror three times.

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:34.300
Oh, boy.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:40.060
So Alex, there's some talk from these ex-presidents

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.220
about how they're going to take that vaccine on TV.

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:43.420
Which I think is stupid.

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.340
Well, I think it's perfunctory.

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:46.780
I think it's what you have to do.

01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:50.500
But Alex, of course, has a rebuttal all ready to go.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.620
Bill Clinton says, I'm going to take a vaccine.

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.180
I'll do it on TV.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:59.540
If you believe they're going to take an mRNA vaccine that

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:04.060
reprograms every cell in your body, I mean,

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:04.940
this is their move.

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:06.620
I mean, they're not just going to sterilize you.

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:07.220
You know that.

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:08.020
You're dead.

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.860
So I mean, obviously, it's going to be if they do get it,

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.980
it'll be that's not really the vaccine.

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:13.660
It's a fake.

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:17.020
It's like a placebo vaccine.

01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.180
The moment they said that, I was like, what the fuck

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:19.860
are we doing?

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:20.860
It's not the real one.

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:24.140
Part of me even believes you get some sort of super rich guy

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:24.940
vaccine.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:27.780
Don't think they're going to trust you guys.

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:34.340
I just think that not doing that is wrong.

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:35.060
Probably.

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:39.900
Because there is something about the communal experience

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:44.180
and seeing these people partake in something very basic

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:47.180
that we all are in.

01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:52.420
There's something unifying to high profile people being like,

01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:54.060
yeah, I'm getting a shot too.

01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:56.500
In the same way that if you were a kid,

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.020
your parent might get a shot.

01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:58.500
Totally.

01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.220
It doesn't hurt.

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:00.300
It's fine.

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:00.860
Yeah.

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:02.900
We're bonding over this.

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:04.540
I think that there's something healthy

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:06.220
when our leaders do that.

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.060
And so I'm not opposed to it.

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.740
I'm not opposed to it for sure.

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:14.940
But pretending that it has any impact on people who are down

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:16.500
these roads is nonsense.

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:20.340
Yeah, the people who hate the three of you the most

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:22.940
are going to be like, well, if they're getting the vaccine

01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:26.300
that I totally believe is the same vaccine that poor people

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:26.900
would get.

01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:27.420
Yeah.

01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:27.940
Jesus.

01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:28.620
Yeah.

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:31.220
So Alex went to a protest the night

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:33.460
before this on the evening of the 3rd

01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:36.580
against Governor Abbott or something, maybe the mayor.

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.780
I think it's actually the mayor.

01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:42.060
But in this next clip, Alex admits to assaulting someone.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:42.700
Hey.

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.500
Last night, I decided, because other people were down

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.260
there protesting the day before, to go down

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:49.900
to protest Mayor Adler, who is on a private jet, big parties,

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:51.900
not wearing masks, but saying our businesses should

01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:52.780
be shut down.

01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:55.660
The guy was yelling at me and threatening me, going, hey,

01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:56.820
why don't you come down here?

01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:58.940
So I just went down there and got his face a little.

01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:00.380
And I probably shouldn't have pulled out his mask.

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:03.900
But I got a little emotional because he was taunting us.

01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:05.660
But I probably shouldn't have assaulted him,

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:06.580
but he was taunting us.

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:08.780
Ugh, yeah.

01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:12.620
I probably shouldn't have threatened his life

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:13.660
by removing his mask.

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:17.860
Hey, if you're the person who Alex pulled on his mask,

01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:18.940
feel free to sue him.

01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:19.420
Yep.

01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:21.580
He has admitted on air that he assaulted you.

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.580
He did it.

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:23.260
No doubt.

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:24.580
He pulled your mask.

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:25.100
Yep.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:25.820
The end.

01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:26.740
He has confessed.

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:28.860
Open and shut case.

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:31.980
So in this next clip, Alex confesses to something else.

01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:33.980
And that is that he is very stupid

01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:36.340
and a big old Islamophobe.

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:39.660
UK police patrolling pubs, throwing out customers

01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:42.740
for eating scotched eggs.

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:44.380
That's right, no drinking allowed.

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:47.060
And if we catch you, even with an egg that

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:50.580
has flavoring of whiskey, we're arresting you, yes.

01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:52.260
But the Muslims can run sex rings

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:53.900
with your kidnapped daughters, it's fine.

01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:54.820
Whoa.

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:57.460
So scotch eggs aren't whiskey flavored.

01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:03.860
That escalated from local cuisine very quickly.

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:05.220
They're not whiskey eggs.

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:07.780
No, I was going to say, does he not know what a scotch egg is?

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:09.460
No, he clearly doesn't.

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.260
It's an egg wrapped in sausage and then covered in breadcrumbs.

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:15.340
There was a part of me that, like, I immediately went,

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:16.420
that's not a scotch egg.

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:18.260
And then I had to question myself, like,

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:21.140
did I not know there was, no, of course there is.

01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:23.900
What's going on here is that in an area of the UK

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:27.380
where this restaurant in question was located,

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:28.860
the government had put in place rules

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:31.940
that bars can't serve alcohol unless it's part of them

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:33.620
operating as a restaurant.

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:35.020
Right, you have to go to bed.

01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.340
That is to say that bars and pubs without food

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:38.940
are not allowed to be open.

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:41.020
There was a screenshot of a receipt from a London

01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:43.860
restaurant called the Refinery New Street that

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:47.940
showed a bill for 63 Peronys, 12 glasses of Prosecco,

01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:49.700
and one scotch egg.

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.420
This was being circulated to imply

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.460
that this is how they're going to get

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.460
around the COVID restrictions.

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.220
In reality, the receipt is cropped

01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:58.780
to make it appear that the group only ordered one scotch egg,

01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:00.460
but they'd also ordered a ton more food,

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:01.740
according to the restaurant.

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:03.340
This is just a social media meme.

01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:04.820
It's such bullshit.

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:07.340
None of the stuff that Alex is reporting on here is real.

01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:09.780
He's just misunderstanding a headline of a story

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:13.460
that he hasn't read, making up what he thinks scotch eggs are,

01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:15.300
and using it to throw around completely

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:17.260
unnecessary Islamophobia.

01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:19.420
This is what he does as a career.

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:22.020
He's an idiot who refuses to do any preparation

01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:25.020
or any work and just spreads hate all over the place,

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:27.220
because it's all he can do.

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:28.100
He's useless.

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:30.420
Social media is the fucking devil.

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:31.580
We should just get rid of it.

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:34.940
We should only live in communities of 150 or less.

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.940
Everybody owns their own business.

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:38.340
I've remade the entire global economy.

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:39.060
I saw this.

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:39.980
I solved it.

01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:41.780
I saw this picture of the receipt,

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:43.780
and I thought, like, ah, that's fun.

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:45.940
It's very obviously cropped, because it

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:47.380
doesn't have a total or anything.

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:48.620
Oh, well, that fucking dicks.

01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:50.380
The receipt is cut off right under the.

01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:52.100
How do you not get off?

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:53.820
Yeah, but it's like, ah, that's fun,

01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:55.060
because that is a lot of booze.

01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:56.060
That is a lot of booze.

01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:58.540
Yeah.

01:11:58.540 --> 01:11:59.620
Yeah, I don't know.

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:01.580
I would say Alex should try a little harder.

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:02.740
Yeah.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:03.700
So in this next clip.

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:05.140
Social media internet.

01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:06.140
Perhaps.

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.220
So in this next clip, Alex claims

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:11.980
that he's known what's going to happen, all this stuff that's

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:12.900
happening around us.

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:14.820
He's known it all for 10 years.

01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:17.220
And he's been totally consistent on all of this.

01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:18.300
Absolutely.

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.300
I told you lockdown's coming years ago.

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:22.980
Using a virus as the pretext to bring in martial law,

01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:26.220
forced inoculation, and digital tracking systems on your phones.

01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:27.900
People are like, how did Jones know it?

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:31.060
They said they'd do it in Operation Lockstep 10 years

01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:31.980
ago.

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:33.460
Didn't exist 10 years ago.

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:34.660
That's what's so frustrating.

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:35.540
It doesn't exist now.

01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.820
I'm just here like I'm going to play, and they go, oh,

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.100
the next page is there.

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:40.620
Romeo and Juliet commits suicide.

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:41.900
Oh, the next page is the.

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:44.340
And I'm just like, OK, now they're going to do this.

01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:46.140
Now they're going to do that.

01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:47.660
I mean, they're going to kill you.

01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:49.780
Operation Lockstep isn't a real thing.

01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:52.220
Alex didn't know about it.

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:55.700
Everything is such horseshit.

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:58.060
Right before the 2016 election, Alex

01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:59.860
wasn't making his audience scared

01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:02.820
about a virus that was going to bring in martial law

01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.180
and tracking and all this.

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:06.380
He said that Obama was going to declare himself

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:08.020
the king of Muslim elimination.

01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:08.940
He did.

01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:09.860
There was that.

01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:10.580
That was his.

01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:11.340
There was that.

01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:12.580
There was none of this shit.

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:14.740
Stevie P said he was waiting for the government

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:17.340
to collapse so he could make everybody Dukes.

01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:18.500
No, that was Larry Nichols.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.260
Oh, that was Nichols.

01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:19.860
That's right.

01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:21.460
That's right.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:23.220
No, you don't get to play this card.

01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:24.500
You don't get to pretend that.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.380
It's ludicrous.

01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:28.300
Dan, are we broadcasting from the rubble

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:30.620
of a nuclear explosion in Chicago?

01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.580
I mean, according to Alex's predictions, yes.

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:34.340
See, that's kind of what I was thinking.

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.980
If he's been right about everything.

01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:36.700
No.

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.380
This is the shell game that you get

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:41.140
to play when you're someone like Alex and your audience

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:42.900
has just decided to give up.

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.540
Much like you when you don't have the cliff you want to play.

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:47.260
Our only option is to give up and believe you're bold.

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:49.740
Once you've been browbeaten to the point of, like,

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:52.660
accepting Alex as a reasonable person,

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:55.260
you just think like, oh yeah, he has always

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.460
been saying that they'd use a virus to bring

01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:58.940
in the world government.

01:13:58.940 --> 01:13:59.980
No, he hasn't.

01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:02.980
If I believe the shit he's saying about now,

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:06.540
why wouldn't I believe him when he says now

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:08.100
that he said it earlier?

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:08.940
Right.

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:13.300
And this actually gets to one of the reasons why, I mean, even

01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:15.500
like, if I were Joe Rogan, I would just

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:18.020
be personally offended by the way Alex has treated me.

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:18.820
Yeah.

01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:21.540
And I would, just as a matter of self-respect,

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.020
I wouldn't hang out with him.

01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:24.860
But if you want to take it a step

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:28.620
farther and discuss what the real issues are,

01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:32.660
when Alex was on Rogan's podcast last with Tim Dillon,

01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:36.900
when they had that episode and Alex was one step away

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:41.180
from being exposed as having made up Operation Lockstep,

01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:44.060
the way that they dropped the ball there.

01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:45.820
And again, like I said, not their fault.

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:46.780
They didn't know what the deal was.

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:47.700
They never had a chance.

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:48.500
Right.

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:52.300
But because they didn't, that means Alex wins that point.

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:53.100
Yep.

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:56.300
Because of that, because Alex didn't get exposed in front

01:14:56.300 --> 01:15:00.380
of millions of people as having made up this Rockefeller plan

01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:03.260
that now he's claiming he's known about for 10 years,

01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:05.020
he gets to play games like this.

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:10.380
And you have done, at least by virtue of your inability

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:14.020
to stand up to the claim, you've helped solidify it.

01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:16.580
You've helped reinforce and make it look like.

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:20.500
And the fact that, like, here's what I'm more offended by.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:21.700
What's that?

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:26.780
Rogan had every opportunity after that podcast to find out

01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:29.940
if Alex was full of shit and lying to him.

01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:33.100
And clearly, he didn't, because he did four hours

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.140
in an interview with him.

01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:37.820
Yeah, it would suggest he didn't really follow up on stuff.

01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:39.140
Yeah, yeah.

01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:43.060
And that one's such a big, obvious one.

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.580
The lockstep thing is just so fucking obvious

01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:47.300
if you know what he's talking about.

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:48.380
It's just disgraceful.

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:51.980
And so this, like I said, personal level,

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:55.940
the way Alex has treated Rogan as a person is disgraceful,

01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:57.700
and no one should put up with that.

01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:01.500
But societally, it does damage.

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:05.020
Just not being competent at pushing back

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.300
against Alex's narratives only serves

01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:10.380
to sell your audience to them.

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:14.540
It does seem like with propaganda in those kind of outlets,

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:18.260
there's one chance to win or you lose forever.

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:21.260
Like, once you cede ground on that, it's gone.

01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:22.700
It never comes back.

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.540
And if you win, you don't gain the ground.

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:28.700
You just don't lose any, and it's brutal.

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:30.820
Yeah, and if you put yourself in that situation,

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:33.100
you gotta understand that as the-

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.980
The stakes are high.

01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:35.820
Yeah, exactly.

01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:37.740
Especially if you've got millions of listeners every,

01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:38.580
yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:41.300
It's why if you're somebody who has a platform

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:45.100
and you bring somebody on who's maybe a bad actor,

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:48.140
you have really high levels of responsibility.

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:48.980
Totally.

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:50.220
If you're somebody who has a show,

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:52.500
you can bring on someone like Richard Spencer

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.820
or Milo Yiannopoulos, but you have a great responsibility

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:58.500
to not allow them to frame everything.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:16:59.340
Yep.

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:00.940
And that is your job.

01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:04.580
And the challenge is such that you cannot half-ass it.

01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:05.420
Right.

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:09.820
And Rogan, to his unfortunate naivete or whatever,

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:11.500
I don't believe that anymore,

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:14.260
but he thinks that he's just having a conversation

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:15.580
with friends or whatever.

01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:17.580
At least that's what he wants to present.

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:21.100
And because of that, you're never gonna be in a position.

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:22.580
And that's why he can't have people

01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.580
like Milo Yiannopoulos on anymore.

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:26.260
He can't have those guests on anymore

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:29.220
because it's too, you can't do that.

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:30.060
You can't do it.

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.860
Yeah, somehow Alex is still fine, but-

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:33.900
I don't know how.

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.740
I don't either.

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:35.580
That's what we're doing.

01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:37.420
So anyway, we have one last clip here.

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:40.020
And Alex has a guest on named Jennifer Fleck.

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.820
And she claimed that she had footage or something

01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:44.780
of voter fraud in Austin.

01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:45.620
Sure.

01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:48.500
Because of course, deep blue areas are only deep blue

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.580
because the Democrats are stealing all the votes.

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:51.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.260
Whatever.

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:53.100
That's the only thing that makes sense.

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:55.580
Right, so she's on and I found this really weird

01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:58.220
because she was like, she was running for some office

01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:01.820
lost in the GOP primary and then became a poll watcher.

01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.020
Sure, that's good.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.820
Got into some kind of a dust up

01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:06.620
because she had like recording equipment

01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:07.780
and you're not allowed to have that.

01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:08.620
Great, great, great.

01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:09.460
It's like, all right.

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:10.300
Okay.

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:11.140
I don't care.

01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:13.300
I really don't care about any of this.

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:15.620
Like her voter fraud stories,

01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:17.580
because they're thin and I don't see any evidence of this.

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:19.620
How do we let so many people in politics

01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:21.540
who wouldn't be allowed in a bar?

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.940
There's a bit, bars have bouncers.

01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:26.340
She wouldn't go to a bar because she's very into God

01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:28.300
and going to church and all this.

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:31.260
I read that on her ballotpedia Q&A.

01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:32.100
Great.

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:35.380
Anyway, I don't care about their interview at all.

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:36.220
Sure.

01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:37.340
But I would just like to demonstrate

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:39.060
what sort of people the two of them are.

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:39.900
Okay.

01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:42.540
As they get into some real ableist shithead joking.

01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:43.500
Great, great.

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:46.700
I remember reading the governor's executive order

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:49.560
this summer and there were like 10 exceptions

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:53.500
to businesses closing or that he had like 10 exceptions.

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:54.980
And I remember one of them was that

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:58.020
he closed all the rafting businesses.

01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:00.440
Like you couldn't, like your rafting businesses

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:01.420
couldn't stay open.

01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:04.820
And I thought, how bizarre that he would attack

01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:08.500
a small business in Texas and let all these other big-

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:11.420
Let's just say it, he's a miserable person.

01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:12.820
I'm sorry he's a handicap.

01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:14.100
He can't go rafting.

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:15.340
He doesn't want you to.

01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:16.660
Right?

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:19.700
No, it's because float trips were spreading.

01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:23.780
A lot of cases of COVID were happening at float trips.

01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:26.500
Do you not remember the Trump float trip

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.340
that spread all the shit?

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:31.540
And float trips in rafts and stuff like that

01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:35.880
are just like 20 year olds drunk as fuck in big groups,

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:37.460
barges going down the river.

01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:40.600
Like it's obviously, yeah.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.180
It seems if you've never been on a float trip before

01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:44.500
probably might be like-

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:46.700
It's social distance, you're in a tube.

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:49.260
You're in a canoe and maybe someone else is in a canoe

01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:50.100
a ways away from you.

01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:51.380
That's not always the case.

01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:53.020
No, no.

01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:55.620
I can see, as someone who's been on a lot of float trips,

01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:58.420
I can see why someone would close a rafting business.

01:19:58.420 --> 01:19:59.340
And that's shitty.

01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:01.020
That's fucking shitty.

01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:02.420
The way they're acting and being like,

01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:06.660
yeah, he's just mad that he can't go rafting.

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:07.900
Fuck you, Alex.

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:09.380
You loved Greg Abbott

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.780
until he didn't do what you wanted him to do.

01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:14.900
Yeah, we're in a little bit of a bar situation here.

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:19.580
And now you dare attack him for his disability status.

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.300
Go fuck yourself.

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.900
What a piece of shit.

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:25.340
Yep, anytime you are talking about somebody

01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:27.100
and then you use A

01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.980
and then a descriptor that is not human,

01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:31.340
then you, you know.

01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:33.740
It's like whenever, you know,

01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:38.220
when you're listening to Andy Daley and Paul M. Hopkins,

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:40.100
where he was as L. Ron Hubbard,

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:42.780
every time you heard him say like a Japanese,

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:43.620
you're like,

01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:47.820
Ooh, that's fucked, gross.

01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:52.100
Yeah, that sort of linguistic framing is terrible.

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:52.940
It's dehumanizing.

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:54.980
Yeah, and I resent it.

01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:59.660
And I want to say everybody who Alex likes now,

01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:01.660
look at how he's treating people

01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:05.100
who have behaved in ways that are just slightly outside

01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:06.860
of what he wants them to do.

01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:09.180
Look at this, he loved Greg Abbott.

01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:11.540
He was one of the best governors in the country.

01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:12.580
Maybe the best.

01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:15.620
Probably, real great governor, we love him.

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:18.340
Now he's being ableist against him.

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:20.140
He's attacking him,

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:22.580
not only for like him not being extreme enough,

01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:24.780
but on these really shitty personal grounds

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:27.100
that are bigoted and horrible.

01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:30.020
Rogan, when he's doing what he wants him to do,

01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:31.500
Alex would be like, he's so brave,

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.180
he's braver than Tucker Carlson.

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:34.980
When he doesn't, he'll bring up your kids

01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:36.460
and say he's gonna destroy you.

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:38.900
Cut you in half, bleed you like a pig.

01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:42.020
Consider this, this is how Alex operates.

01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:45.180
Yeah, I mean, so the thing is,

01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:49.260
he exists in this form of unreality that has to be total.

01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:52.300
You can't allow a single real thing

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.540
to come into the unreality bubble.

01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:56.380
Otherwise, the whole thing bursts.

01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:58.860
So just like if you're seeing your guy,

01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:00.420
Barr is doing something different.

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:03.820
Well, now I can't allow that into the bubble.

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:07.180
Well, it's the nuance that you introduce

01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:09.020
when you're like, why would Barr,

01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:11.820
if he's the kind of shithead I want him to be,

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:16.220
why would he not do this thing that I think he should do?

01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:17.780
You can't like...

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:19.100
Well, and not just that,

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:22.900
but you've painted the Democrats as total complete evil.

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:27.220
So any agreement with the Democrats means you're evil.

01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:28.060
You must be.

01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:29.020
You have to be.

01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:31.340
Otherwise, that introduces the possibility

01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:33.780
that not all Democrats are evil.

01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:34.620
And then everything falls apart.

01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:35.780
And then it's done.

01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:39.620
Now, I will say that Alex also played a lot

01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:44.620
of the Trump's speech, his 49-minute video that he put out.

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:46.020
Sure, great.

01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:48.300
And I don't have a lot of clips of it

01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:51.220
because Alex didn't editorialize on it all that much

01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:52.940
because it sounds like Alex.

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:53.940
It sounds exactly like Alex.

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:54.780
Yes.

01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:55.620
Yeah, it's word for word.

01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:56.620
It's scary as shit.

01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:57.900
And I want to make a point of this,

01:22:57.900 --> 01:22:59.340
like as we close the episode,

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:01.060
that like, yep, that was on his show.

01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:04.100
And it's scary as hell because Trump just sounds like Alex.

01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:06.540
It's fucking terrifying, full stop.

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:08.580
I don't know what else to say about it.

01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:11.580
I hope.

01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:14.820
You know, it's so weird to talk to my family now

01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:19.820
because it's like before, in the old times, you know,

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:22.260
they could be like, oh, we're just mainstream Republicans.

01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:24.260
We don't talk about that Alex Jones stuff.

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:26.700
And it's like, now you voted for Trump.

01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:27.820
This is what he's saying.

01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:30.180
You're in my world and you're wrong.

01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:31.060
That's it.

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:35.140
So if you want to, you can't argue with me, that's over.

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:35.980
The end.

01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:37.980
You believe this shit.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:38.820
Yeah.

01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:39.660
Done.

01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:42.420
And the thing that really bummed me out, I guess,

01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:44.420
and it doesn't bum me out, but it felt really weird.

01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:48.020
It's like, just because I listened to so much Alex,

01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:51.140
when people would say like, Trump sounds like Alex Jones,

01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:52.580
like, nah, not quite.

01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:54.100
There's some slight differences.

01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:54.940
Yeah.

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:58.780
Or it's like, that's not really what Alex's talking point is.

01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.700
You'd think it is, but that's,

01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:03.700
now I listen to the tapes of that

01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:05.460
and I was like, holy shit.

01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:06.300
No, Trump-

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:07.780
This is exactly the same as Alex's.

01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:10.820
Trump might as well like play that 90 second clip

01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:13.140
and be like, her name is this.

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:15.300
And it's, I wouldn't be surprised

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.820
if he starts doing that soon.

01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:18.620
Yeah, it's-

01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:19.740
It's crazy.

01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:23.100
Well, I mean, I think you just,

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:24.460
you take the support you got

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:28.620
and when shit's looking real bad like it is,

01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:31.220
what you got is Alex and Tom Papert.

01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:32.060
Yeah.

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:32.900
Good luck.

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.020
I just keep, like the thing that I keep thinking

01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:37.660
is just like, be wary, be wary.

01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:39.820
Because when these lawsuits and stuff,

01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:43.340
he's desperate now that when the lawsuits and stuff stop,

01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:47.060
does anybody really believe he's going to be like, well,

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:48.500
guess I lost this one.

01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:51.220
You know, when the lawsuits are done-

01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:52.060
Yeah.

01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:52.900
He's got to do something.

01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:53.740
I think he might-

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:54.580
Desperate.

01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:55.780
Well, no, I don't know.

01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:58.060
Oh, you think he might just give up?

01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:58.900
Yeah.

01:24:58.900 --> 01:24:59.740
Well, I mean-

01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:00.580
He made a bunch of money.

01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:02.020
Well, that's true.

01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:04.300
But he's never made, he doesn't make enough money.

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:05.700
None of these guys ever make,

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:06.540
I don't know.

01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:08.780
Why does Bezos need another $30 billion

01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:10.420
as everybody dies around him?

01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:11.260
He doesn't need it.

01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:12.140
Right, I don't know.

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:15.180
I don't know in like us war gaming,

01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:17.140
what we imagine he's going to do,

01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:17.980
like Trump is going to do.

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:18.820
Sure, no, I'm not war gaming.

01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.020
I'm just saying be wary.

01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:20.860
You know what I mean?

01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:21.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:24.300
But trying to predict, I've found is a useless use

01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:25.140
of my time.

01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:25.980
Totally.

01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:28.500
But being wary is always wise.

01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:30.900
I think being wary, a lot of people are just thinking

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:33.100
it's going to go away, and I'm just saying, be wary.

01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:34.140
Head on a swivel.

01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:34.980
Yes.

01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:35.820
Look around.

01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:36.660
Always.

01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:37.620
Yeah.

01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:38.700
Keep an eye out.

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:42.020
This is not the 79 days of hell,

01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:43.980
but it is the 79 days of hm?

01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:47.580
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, where are you?

01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:48.900
Easy.

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:50.620
79 days of careful.

01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:53.620
Careful, watch out, it's a wild animal

01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:56.580
and it's in a corner, just back slowly.

01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:58.420
So we will see what happens.

01:25:58.420 --> 01:25:59.260
But we'll be back.

01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:02.580
And maybe we'll do that Rogan episode sooner than later.

01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:07.380
Because it is a four hour like mystery box today.

01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:10.460
I did only make it through the first bit of it.

01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:13.460
It could be amazing once it gets rolling

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:16.140
or it could be continuing of that,

01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:19.060
just walking through fucking knee deep mud.

01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:22.260
Yeah, it has to be a disaster or something

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:25.700
to like sink your teeth into because that just,

01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:31.180
see one thing I like about smoking weed,

01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:32.820
yeah, Joe, we know.

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:33.900
Yeah, it's good.

01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:36.700
Yeah, great, great guys, come on now.

01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:38.100
So we will be back.

01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:39.580
But until then, we have a website.

01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:41.540
We do have a website, it's knowledgefight.com.

01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:43.060
Yep, we're also on Twitter.

01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:44.900
We are on Twitter, it's at Knowledge Underscore Fight

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:45.740
and I go to bed Jordan.

01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:46.580
We're also on Facebook.

01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:49.140
We are on Facebook, you tell us you're right.

01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:50.660
And if you could please find a local charity

01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:52.460
or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:53.780
doing God's work right now.

01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:54.620
Yeah, we will be back.

01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:57.060
But until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX Clark,

01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:57.900
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:26:57.900 --> 01:26:59.100
I didn't bring this up earlier,

01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:01.700
but I think it's really funny that at the time

01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:03.460
that we started recording this episode,

01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:06.540
I don't know if Rudy Giuliani actually has COVID.

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:07.380
Neither do I.

01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:09.620
Because the headline is just that Trump said he did.

01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:11.180
Trump said, I know, so who the fuck knows.

01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:14.340
I don't know if Trump actually is right about this or what.

01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:15.380
He might have just made it up.

01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:18.260
Anyway, that's pretty, pretty, I don't know,

01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:20.940
it's not a good place to be as a society.

01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:23.580
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:26.620
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller,

01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:28.260
I'm a huge fan, I love your work.

01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:38.260
I love you.
