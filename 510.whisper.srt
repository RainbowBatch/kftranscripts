7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,720
saying we are the bad guys

Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,680

Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,680
I'm Jordan

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,520
We're a couple dudes, I'd like to sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

25
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,720
Oh indeed we are, Dan

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,120
Jordan

27
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,520
Dan

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,000
Throw it in

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,960
I have a quick question for you

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,200
Sure

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,240
What's your bright spot today?

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,320
My bright spot today is a follow-up to our

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:12,800
Follow-up?

34
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,520
Yes, to our bonus episode that we put out on Wednesday

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,400
Indeed we did

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,000
People can find that over on patreon.com slash knowledgefight

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,880
You can just look at it

38
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,360
Sure, you don't have to be a subscriber or anything, it's free, it's public, but it's posted there

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,120
on that page and we had played a delightful game of Thomas Jefferson or not Thomas Jefferson quotes

40
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,600
Indeed

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,040
Um, and my bright spot is following up on some things from the Zeep mailbox

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,360
Okay

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,960
So Nick sent some chocolate and some of these little nanoblocks

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,960
Ah yes, yes, yeah

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,080
I have to say first of all that nanoblocks are the coolest, greatest thing

46
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:58,800
They are like little tiny Legos and I found building this pelican to be incredibly like a zen state

47
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,360
I just felt really good, I was relaxed building this because you do have to focus

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah

49
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,080
Put the piece in the right place

50
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,360
It was great, it was like a really, it really triggered a lot of those feelings that I had

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,960
that I loved about Legos and I appreciate that gift

52
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,120
And then also a follow-up on that chocolate

53
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,120
The fizzy jelly

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,280
Did you save any for me?

55
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,680
No

56
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,760
I did not think so and it was brutal because the moment you told me you liked it I was like

57
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,640
I would like to try it and I know I'm never going to get the chance

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,880
I will order a bar just so you can try it

59
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,840
Just so I can try it

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,960
It was so good

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,120
How was it good?

62
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,560
How was it good?

63
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,440
It was balanced

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,440
Was it gummy and chewy?

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,080
There were little bits of gummy but not like offensively so

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,560
Okay

67
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,080
Like it wasn't like there was a like gum in the middle of something

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,640
Okay, alright

69
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,160
And then there was like a fizziness, like pop rocks kind of thing

70
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,480
Really?

71
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,960
But it wasn't over the top fizzy

72
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,520
Okay

73
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,360
It was a nonsense game

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,240
Alright, okay

75
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,080
On paper it doesn't work but it was so good

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,800
This is one of those things where you're gonna have another one and you're gonna be like

77
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,640
You know what, I realize all I liked was the fact that these things don't happen to me before

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,320
and now that I've tried them again they're awful

79
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,360
There's a chance but as it stands now I ate the fucking shit out of that bar

80
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,560
I want to try it

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,640
I want to try it, you could have saved me a piece

82
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,040
Nope

83
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,440
Nope

84
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:21,680
Nope

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,440
So what's your bright spot?

86
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,840
Well my bright spot was going to be the piece of chocolate I was about to eat

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,400
Wow

88
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,040
Not gonna happen

89
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:29,920
No

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,880
You know who has it?

91
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
John Grand Prix has that chocolate

92
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,520
How's he doing?

93
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:33,920
Not good

94
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,280
My bright spot is a movie called Wild Mountain Time, I think is what it's called

95
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,520
And it is an inexplicable movie

96
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,800
I love it

97
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,440
You know those movies- The fizzy jelly candy of movies

98
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,480
A little bit, yeah

99
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,600
You know those movies where you're like this is not a good movie

100
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,200
This is not a bad movie

101
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,640
This movie just needed to exist where it didn't before

102
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,920
Like it's just a thing that you're like I'm glad that's there now

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,120
It wasn't

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,640
And it's my favorite type of story

105
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,960
I don't know exactly what you're talking about

106
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,040
It's my favorite type of story for two reasons

107
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,000
One, it opens up with Christopher Walken doing voiceover in a terrible Irish accent

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,800
That sounds like somebody doing an impression of Christopher Walken trying to do an Irish accent

109
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,120
Okay

110
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,840
It's fantastic

111
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,720
And you're like oh this is probably gonna stop

112
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,360
Nope

113
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,840
Keeps going

114
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,400
Keeps going

115
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,880
Oh yeah

116
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,720
This leads me to believe that it is a bad movie

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,840
No it's amazing

118
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,400
It's amazing

119
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,440
And it's also my favorite type of Irish story of which there are only two

120
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,360
There are two Irish stories in the world, Dan

121
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,040
There's Irish stories that go like this

122
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,080
Oh my god you're an outsider get the fuck away

123
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,040
And then over time they're like okay fine you can stay

124
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,080
But you know too much so you can never leave

125
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,800
Or the other kind where it's like ah get the fuck away from here

126
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,760
And then they leave

127
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,960
Like those are the only two types

128
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,320
If there's no story where the Irish people grow and change

129
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,800
Nuh-uh you're either in or out and that's it

130
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,200
Okay

131
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,120
And this is very much one of those stories

132
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,320
And then like the way it could be sold to you

133
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,440
The way that people are going to review it is there's like a twist at the end

134
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,960
There is not a twist

135
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,240
It's not a twist

136
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,600
It's just a reason and it's going to blow your fucking mind

137
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Okay I'm not gonna watch this movie but

138
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,400
You gotta see it

139
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay fine I'll watch it

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,840
Just because I want people to talk about it

141
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,280
I want more people to talk about it

142
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,480
I want to talk about this movie

143
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,880
You're gonna get some messages now from people who want to discuss

144
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,000
I can't wait

145
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,520
Rocky Mountain Fever whatever it's called

146
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,440
It's an insane movie I can't wait

147
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,840
All right

148
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,280
Jordan today we have an interesting episode to go over

149
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,480
My path was winding and rocky as I got to this episode

150
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,720
But I think we're gonna have some fun

151
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,240
And before we get into the episode itself let's take a little moment to say thank you

152
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,920
To some folks who've signed up and are supporting the show

153
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,880

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,740
I enjoy the show. I'd like to support these gents too. You can do that by going to our website

182
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,340
knowledgefight.com clicking the button says support the show or what you could do is you could take that

183
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,780
Generosity and you could just funnel it into some sort of creative spirit and it doesn't matter what it's about

184
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,020
It doesn't matter what it's about or whether or not it's good what it's about is getting it out there

185
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,940
So even if you're confused by your generous spirit put it out there

186
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,700
Take it to a local bail funder charity and I'll be goddamn if it's not better said in Ireland. So there you go

187
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,700
There you go

188
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,740
Landed it. Yeah. Thank you. So Jordan this episode today. We're gonna start

189
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,860
Where where I'm sort of going down this road

190
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,520
Starting with a little bit from Wednesday December 9th. Okay on Alex's show

191
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,820
He's he's in a weird headspace can just bragging

192
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,620
There's about a half hour at the beginning about a half hour bragging about half hour of him

193
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,500
Just talking about how he's like so popular

194
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,540
Everybody loves all right. I mean look

195
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,440
We've been taking off almost every box system that plugs into the internet and quote gives you cable

196
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,160
But cloud TV is owned by Patriots. They put us on two years ago

197
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,120
We're number one on cloud TV

198
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,740
And if you combine all news channels together including OAN or bigger than all of them Newsmax OAN all of them together

199
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,560
And again, they're kind of shocked by that

200
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,540
They even moved us used to we were at the top is whatever was number one

201
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,740
They put at the top they kind of move us the bottom like well

202
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,700
He just he just dominates too much

203
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,100
We kind of that sounds like like a good reason channels will get some more viewers

204
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,800
And I'm not in competition with those folks. I love OAN. I really like Newsmax

205
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:20,580
It's just that they won't play just funny because we have more viewers than all of them combined on cloud TV

206
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,480
Obviously OAN is on a much more cable systems and satellite systems, and I love it

207
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,980
And I hope OAN or Newsmax become the number one stations. I don't care. We're too popular. We're just so popular

208
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,780
We're too popular

209
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,060
They used to put us up at the top because we were so popular

210
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:38,460
But now they put us at the bottom so other channels have a chance. That really doesn't sound right that doesn't sound like good business logic

211
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:45,500
This goes on for so fucking long. I was getting so annoyed and then Alex was like not only am I the most popular thing

212
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
I'm also like super alpha

213
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,580
See, I'm an alpha male so when I was a kid I

214
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,500
Had the alpha genes I guess and I'd see a super like like Jason Jinko jeans

215
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,780
513 where guys coming in with a knife, and you don't fight back and you run you fall down and you plead

216
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:07,500
I thought that was fake. I've grown up now actually the average man or woman does fall down and starts groveling and

217
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,460
But now actually if Jason pulled a knife out the average liberal would run up and grab it and go I love you

218
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,340
I love you. This is good for me isn't in horror movies isn't the thing that people trip isn't that?

219
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,140
Yeah, no white women in a scary situation in a horror movie are going to fall

220
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,140
But even dudes too like you trip over your feet

221
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,060
It's the trope that sure yeah, I don't think that the people

222
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:38,100
I don't know. Maybe there are some horror movies where people intentionally fall down and then beg off with Jason

223
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,460
But I think it's mostly like they're trying to get away and then something happens. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know

224
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,940
I think we're doing their best. They weren't like oh shit

225
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:54,060
Maybe this monster will have mercy. Oh what I should have tried was groveling. Yeah, I don't know anyway

226
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,540
I just got so damn tired of this. Yeah. I was just like I need why?

227
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,160
I just needed something anything to go on and there was one talking point that was going on on Wednesday's show

228
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:16,740
Like I was trying to find like this something to pull out. Yeah. Yeah, this is this is something that is worth discussing

229
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,260
We've got a lot more here to cover but

230
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:26,660
FDA six people died during Pfizer COVID vaccine trial so we're gonna be talking about something else as a whole on today's episode

231
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,180
But I did want to bring this up

232
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,260
I think it's a

233
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:36,540
Important for us to cover this and probably the sooner the better because that feels like it's gonna become a big talking point

234
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,540
Yeah on his show this week

235
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,820
Alex has been repeating this particular headline with outrageous repetition over at infowars

236
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,740
You can find the headline quote FDA six people died during Pfizer COVID vaccine trial

237
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,740
The actual article covers some of the details of this story

238
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,460
But these details you don't really hear them when Alex covers it on the show because he just reads headlines then rants about what he?

239
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,820
Wants the story to be about it sounds scary that six people died in these trials

240
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,660
But in cases like this, it's crucially important to consult the actual information to see what the data says

241
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,100
If you go to the FDA's website

242
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,960
You can find the vaccines and related biological products advisory committee briefing document on the new Pfizer

243
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,280
vaccine if you read this document

244
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,000
You'll find that six participants in the trial are dead, but that number has to be understood in context

245
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,680
The first thing to consider is that there were forty three thousand two hundred fifty two participants enrolled in the study

246
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,120
Six out of that is a very low number

247
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,520
But even so if the vaccine killed six out of forty three thousand people that still might be a cause for concern

248
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,920
Well, I mean if there's three hundred and three thirty million people getting the vaccine, right?

249
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,520
Yes scale up and that could be a huge number it would you know?

250
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,360
So that's why you kind of need to look a little bit further in the text

251
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,040
If you do you'll find that four out of the six deaths were people who were in the placebo group

252
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,280
Which is to say that they didn't even get the vaccine that's being tested

253
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,600
These deaths are absolutely unrelated to the vaccine because they didn't get the vaccine

254
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,680
So that leaves us with two people in the experimental group who died one of whom was retroactively John F

255
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,000
Kennedy so we know why he went down his corpse

256
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,320
It didn't get COVID so these two individuals were both in the older group

257
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:22,920
Which means that they were over 55 years of age one experienced quote cardiac arrests 60 days after dose two and died

258
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,080
Three days later. This was a person who was in the trial, but two months afterwards had a heart attack

259
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,080
This is sad for that person, but almost certainly unrelated to the vaccine

260
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,720
The other person experienced quote arteriosclerosis and died three days after dose one

261
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,760
Arteriosclerosis is a gradual condition

262
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,720
And it's kind of absurd to imagine that it developed in three days because of a vaccine in this case

263
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,680
It seems almost certain that there was an underlying condition unrelated to the vaccine that precipitated the death

264
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,300
I thought it might be possible that you can make a study out of whether or not the vaccine could have

265
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,520
Exacerbated an existing arteriosclerosis, but that doesn't seem like it was a major concern of the authors doesn't seem like it was likely

266
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,080
So there were two deaths in the experimental group, but both are unlikely connected to the vaccine itself

267
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:13,400
But that report is being misrepresented and reported by people like Alex to be that six people died in the trial and you're gonna die

268
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:22,040
too I just it it seems like a very obvious oversight for any news organization not to at least be like

269
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,320
Six people died in the trial only to receive the vaccine in the headline

270
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,760
I'm not I'm not positive how any other outlet reported it so I can't speak to that. I do agree with you

271
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,240
Yeah, that seems that you gotta do that. It's an important detail. Yeah, you can't not do that

272
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
Four in the placebo group is very important

273
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,360
Yeah, when you're looking at that number if two-thirds of the number you're talking about exactly is in the placebo group

274
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:49,560
But I only know what how it was reported on info wars and of course their standard is lying

275
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,640
Yeah, a little bit of a different situation

276
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:59,600
yeah, the paper itself from the FDA explicitly lays this out quote the incidents of severe adverse events and deaths were low in the

277
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,760
context of the number of participants enrolled and

278
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,280
And comparable for experimental and placebo. Yeah, so

279
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,600
This is a disgusting lie on Alex's part

280
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,000
Which he's able to pass off by neglecting to inform his audience of what the headline he's reading actually means

281
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,080
He gives the audience the illusion that he's informing them of important stuff when he reports that six people died in the vaccine trial

282
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:27,560
But what he's actually doing is misinforming the flashy clickbait style headline is not necessarily untrue itself

283
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,280
But the conclusion that's meant to lead you to is a lie and a misrepresentation effects

284
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:40,280
So I got this and I just was like I'm not feeling it. Yeah got one thing. That's like, okay, that's important

285
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:46,920
Yeah, and it'll probably be something you hear about moving forward as more countries roll out of that

286
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,800
But I was like, I don't want to I don't want to I don't care

287
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,480
I don't want to listen to half an hour of Alex

288
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,240
Rambling about how great he is and then I started to think about it this weekend

289
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,600
Alex is supposed to go down to DC. Yeah, I'm supposed to go move to DC

290
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,160
Sure, and that means I got to write a song about yeah, that is true. That is true. You've got some work to do

291
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,080
Uh-huh. So I felt like my follow-ups don't equal the original Monday

292
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,720
We've got to get into like Alex going to DC and all that stuff

293
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,800
Yeah, have a little better idea of what happened with that protest. We have a responsibility, right?

294
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,680
so I was thinking we have a responsibility to do other things and

295
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,720
Maybe now is the best time. Oh, we're not gonna do Rogan are we but you take DMT with Joe Biden

296
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,880
Shit so we're gonna cover the

297
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:47,400
Last week, I think maybe I just recently Joe Rogan showed up in Alex's studio in Austin

298
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,720
And they did a four-hour interview, which I regretfully I have I have just one

299
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,160
I just one thing to say about the vaccine shit, which is that I I

300
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,880
Mean just to take one quick step back

301
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,960
It is amazing to me that they can turn six dead in this trial into a terrifying thing

302
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:13,440
Whenever like it went we went from a brand new disease to a vaccine in a year and a half

303
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,800
That's a fucking miracle. It's a year and a half. Yeah, it's a

304
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,600
miracle to have done that like not since

305
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,800
Like what like they did it one time faster in like the 1950s like it's in a crazy miracle

306
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:34,720
Yeah, and they're just like Oh six dead like wait 100 years ago. They would be like, this is the demon like this is incredible

307
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,880
Yeah, and I didn't read that entire FDA document

308
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:46,240
I was looking over the section about the severe and non severe adverse events and a lot of it didn't see it like

309
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,720
You know, they have to report everything. Sure. So like there's like stats for number of people who had like

310
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:59,020
The a rash. Yeah, exactly or like pain in the site of vaccination. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, all right

311
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,760
Information is there. Yeah, you know, it's there

312
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:09,140
Um, anyway, I agree. I agree. Yeah, but we have issues. We have issues to deal with. Okay

313
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,220
I want to be a globalist. How do I get in?

314
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,900
So we're really doing this, huh? Yeah, we're really gonna listen Joe Rogan talk shit

315
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,940
I'm about people infinitely smarter than I'm gonna say this ahead of time. I

316
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,860
Tried to steer away from conversation about how fucked up they are

317
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:35,220
Yes, because I think that's kind of boring and it's not really all that like I would if I were in a studio with Joe

318
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,700
Rogan, I'd probably be fucked up too. Yeah, it's kind of low-hanging fruit a little bit and it would become tires

319
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,700
I think we just put a disclaimer up top. These guys are fucked up. Yeah

320
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:51,980
Yeah, and I think that other like other people living their lives. I don't think there's anything wrong with being fucked up

321
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,940
No, I do think that there's something probably wrong about Alex

322
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:01,900
Presenting himself the way he does and then being super fucked up with Rogan and talking nonsense. Yeah. Yeah, whatever

323
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,100
I don't really care that much. Yeah, I'm not a square whatever

324
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,720
anyway, I

325
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
Look, it's not as good as

326
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,080
When he Alex was on Rogan, of course not because Alex isn't really trying to impress

327
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:22,100
exactly as much as he is just trying to like solidify the bond between the two of them and yeah and

328
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,620
Try and get whatever he can out of it

329
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,340
But there is still a number of things that I think are important teachable moment. Sure

330
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:35,120
I mean Rogan in Alex's studio isn't fun because at the it's like they're on more of an equal footing

331
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:42,820
Like not in any cool footing but Alex doesn't have to supplicate himself quite as much because when you would

332
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Know oh no

333
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,920
He really what do we start what a wine how dare you say you're an alpha

334
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,380
Why don't why don't we start and listen to this alpha?

335
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,700
Evil wars the most banned network in the world

336
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:05,300
Well, I gotta tell you I get bigger goosebumps with this guy on the air the one I've had Donald Trump on and this movie

337
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,500
Stars, no, seriously

338
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,820
I've known you for 22 years and you're a fun really smart amazing guy and you've put up a lot of my crap and

339
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:18,640
He's the number one not just podcaster but talk show host the world Joe Rogan my fellow Texan Alex Jones. Thanks for having me

340
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,700
Supplication. Oh boy, right out of the go boy. Did he learn that from Stevie P's that level of

341
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Sequience. Yeah, it must have rubbed off. Yeah

342
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,200
Over the years you just learn how to compliment people if you get your balls rubbed by Stevie P's enough

343
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,400
So there's a there's a constant consistent thing throughout this

344
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,240
Interview where Alex seems to want to hit a couple of points pretty hard

345
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,960
Yeah, one of them is why did you move from LA? Sure. Why like how is Spotify?

346
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:54,620
Tell me tell me everybody in LA is evil. Tell me Spotify is a great company to work with and they might be willing to

347
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,620
Pay me

348
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,440
Hey, they let me on the your show on Spotify, maybe they'll let my show on Spotify

349
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,400
Yeah, and you know just a couple of other like pointed things run throughout

350
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,740
Yeah, and so the Alex starts off with hey, man

351
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,520
Why'd you leave LA?

352
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,000
Mm-hmm

353
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,960
I really love Texas for so long and I always was attached to LA because the comedy store because of business and just doing stand

354
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,660
Up there and podcast there

355
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,660
But once they locked everything down

356
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,820
This was the logical place for me to move and and it for me it felt like I had a nice

357
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,540
Excuse to move here and just like I thought about moving here for a long time

358
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:40,380
But it didn't seem feasible and then as soon as the lockdowns happen and then the riots the looting and I was like I gotta

359
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,960
Get the fuck out of LA. I don't believe that for a second. Uh-uh. It's almost certainly tax-related. Yep

360
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,780
Just got a hundred million dollars and LA charges me a lot of money

361
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,500
It turns out and I understand that, you know, Joe would perform in LA and and shit

362
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,180
But like I don't think he lived in the city

363
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,620
Mm-hmm. I don't think he lived anywhere where let's say

364
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:09,360
Protests were no. No, there are so many looters and writers outside of Joe Rogan's neighborhood

365
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,280
Recent hundred millionaire. I know Rogan's mill. I just don't buy it

366
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,540
I find this brings artificial and false

367
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:23,620
But it is probably about the best thing you could do as opposed to saying like I'm fucking loaded now. Yeah, I

368
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,700
Don't need them anymore used to be rich

369
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,700
I

370
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,740
Could be comically rich anywhere

371
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:39,060
I want and it just so happens that Texas is the state where I can stay the most comically

372
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:45,260
I mean it was either Texas or moved to Miami and I don't think he's going to Miami. Yeah, so Alex also

373
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,660
in with his sort of Steve pochenik esque buttering

374
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,980
He's constantly asking Joe like why?

375
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,420
What's it like to be the most famous person in the world?

376
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:04,420
You were so successful early on in your career all this stuff. What's it like having the biggest dick anyone's ever seen

377
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,900
What is it like more or less?

378
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:12,140
Someone's said once a friend of mine said that I'm the bridge between the meatheads and the potheads

379
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,660
I'd like to look at it that well, that was kind of my next angle of my next question

380
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,300
I mean you've been doing podcasting over ten years, right?

381
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:24,180
It's yeah. Yeah 2009. So it's almost 11 years. It'd be 11 years in December

382
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,360
Away, I mean, I mean you've been big right away. You probably been no no

383
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,660
No, it wasn't big at all in the beginning like literally no one was watching

384
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:38,260
It was a it's part of the comedy show. We were watching we were watching Joe. Oh my god. Oh my god

385
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,400
Little brother vibe. This isn't the fucking today's show

386
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,380
Oh

387
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,380
Yeah, I'll tell you you were successful early on despite your yeah, let me

388
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,940
Tell you about your experience I know it better

389
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:00,900
Yeah, I was here. So four minutes in to this interview four minutes

390
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,460
They've had some pleasantries and it's like all just kind of like oh, yeah, you're so great

391
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:11,100
It's so great to have you here awesome. They start smoking weed four minutes in on air. Let's go back to that

392
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,660
That was my first question. How did you develop your worth at ethic and drive because I have some great tobacco

393
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,340
Absolutely. I'll take a pop ball

394
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,220
So they're good

395
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:29,180
they're smoking weed and there was a meme that went around or like a video that someone put together from the

396
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:34,660
Last time Alex was on Rogan and they spliced together things to make it sound like Alex wanted to have sex with Joe

397
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,820
Oh and sort of it went around on Twitter and stuff. Oh, so Alex is constantly

398
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,940
uh

399
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,220
Leaning into that sure sure hoping that someone else makes a video. Right? Right, right

400
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:52,260
It's really desperate and very pathetic right? Yeah, it's it's obnoxious. He's he's just

401
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,780
Outrageously desperate to get a meme. Yes. Yeah

402
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:02,580
I think that's what he wants more than even having Joe on is like somebody in Joe's audience will make something

403
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:08,940
That'll go viral. Yeah, that's that's kind of the goal. I'm looking for 20,000 likes on something

404
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,780
Yeah, and if you got to make fun of me, you got to make fun of me

405
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,140
Hey, well, that's how people have really embraced me because I love being made fun of. Yes

406
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,500
I don't get folks that don't like it. I love it. No you you get a kick out of him

407
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,740
There's a show he would love that

408
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,260
I have a podcast to recommend to him called fucking knowledge fight. I kind of enjoy it

409
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,460
I don't think he's very serious. No, I kind of think that he has very thin skin

410
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:40,060
I think he has a hair trigger as well. I think he might react negatively when he receives any criticism whatsoever

411
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:44,300
Yeah, that could be mm-hmm. Well, I could be wrong though. Maybe he's an avid fan

412
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,860
No, he does not like being made fun of but he likes to say that he likes being made fun of well

413
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,580
It makes him look cool

414
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,620
He kind of likes being made fun of in ways that are profitable to him though

415
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,860
Like so if someone makes a meme that's poking fun at him

416
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:59,980
He gets a ton of people and a ton of attention and his name is all over the place then he'll take it

417
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,900
Yeah, I'll accept being made fun of for profit, right?

418
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:10,100
Right, I will I will accept payment to be in the dunk tank. Yes, but I will not do it for fun. Yeah

419
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:16,800
Yeah, he's a sad clown. Yes in many ways, but you know, it was not Joe Rogan Joe Rogan is the most famous

420
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:23,780
He's the most famous person in the world. He is the Walter Cronkite of our time. Oh god

421
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,620
No

422
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:30,140
when did you realize that you were in the site guys because you were already in the site guys to hit TV shows and UFC and

423
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,580
You know big movies and you know the national champion

424
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,340
I mean you've had success since day one you had to fight hard for it. But what did you realize? Oh my god

425
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:42,860
I'm like a real superstar not of some just empty movie or an empty actor that reads off a

426
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,860
Teleprompter a script you get to be your own self and be the biggest that's that's that's very rare

427
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:54,660
The tobacco is kicking in. I I don't know if I ever realized it. I'm not sure if I still realize it

428
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,740
Come on, you got it. Like like what cuz I mean, I'm pretty super famous, too

429
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,460
One of the reasons why I like pot is it makes me think about much more interesting things

430
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:09,820
So like wolf, but I kind of respect that answer because it's a it's a really embarrassing question

431
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:14,980
It is and for Joe as like a person like the graceful

432
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:20,260
dignified way to respond to that is I don't think about that too much because

433
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:25,740
To imagine that you do think about it is is gross. Yeah. Yeah

434
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,380
Joe I have a quick question how often and

435
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:36,220
Strenuously, do you sniff your own farts and believe them to be amazing? Could you just tell me real quick?

436
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,140
Your farts don't stink obviously, sir, obviously, when did you first notice?

437
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,820
Well, I mean like what other answer could he give that doesn't make him look like a shithead the fuck

438
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,420
Well, I think it was about July

439
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,700
2014 that I realized that I was the king of the world

440
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:01,860
Isn't the great pothead meathead summit of 2016? Yeah, whatever I brought them to together. Yeah

441
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:09,140
No one thought that I could reach day talk between the two but much like Steve pochenik solving all the world conflicts

442
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,140
I solved the meathead jock

443
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,860
pothead

444
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,680
Conflict it turns out everybody likes doing nothing sometimes

445
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,460
So Alex tried to destroy Joe when Joe said that he couldn't be on his show

446
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:29,580
So as this goes yeah a couple times back when Alex was on he lied to Joe's face about Sandy Hook

447
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,660
He did do that. Yes

448
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,140
Yeah

449
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:37,820
And apparently Joe found out about this and it was right around when a lot of attention was going on with the Sandy Hook suit

450
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:42,100
might have been around the time Alex threatened to murder the opposing council or

451
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,260
I'm sorry put out a million-dollar hit Wow

452
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,620
What's a what's a million dollars between friends? Sure

453
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:53,700
Yeah, so Joe said that Alex couldn't be on his show for the time being so that was resolved

454
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,260
I said that Joe is a sneaky snake you that threatened to destroy him talking about his children

455
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,140
Yeah, you didn't threaten to kill his well, but he was talking about them in a way that is very inappropriate

456
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,380
I'm not happy for public discussion. No

457
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,660
um

458
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,420
Now looks kind of wants to say sorry about all that

459
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:16,020
Well, I'm gonna mea copa some before you know the hardcore issues here with you tonight. We appreciate you being her Joe and

460
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,500
That's that I've kind of gotten whacked out under all the pressure all the attacks

461
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,900
Yeah, we've been over this so many times the opposite of Fame though

462
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:29,620
It's like being I get Ellen is is is you almost start becoming the villain, but I just want to say the way you help man

463
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,020
I wrote that was a big help. Well, we just

464
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,900
I wrote for a long time and I think that's it's just a

465
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:43,900
It's really a microcosm of what is happening online with people is that they're not talking to each other

466
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:51,060
No, it's not. It is not a microcosm of what's going on with social media. No, no not communicating with each other

467
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:56,380
It's very much a case of Alex trying to ride your coattails

468
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,460
this is one of those things where I

469
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,660
Remember this quote from Sinbad and I will till a day. I die the sailor or the comedian

470
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,420
the comedian, okay

471
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,260
Comics are funnier when they ride the bus

472
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:17,260
Mmm, just that like simple like you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. You hundred millionaire dumbass

473
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:23,940
Yeah, what are you talking about? What's going on online right now? Yeah, your experience is stupid. Yeah, sure and

474
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,460
like Joe

475
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,700
I I don't know what the fuck he thinks Alex does for a living

476
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:38,140
Like I don't I don't know does he not know what Alex's show is about. He's never watched imagine

477
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:43,200
He doesn't have the time. Does he imagine that Alex is talking about like real conspiracies still? Yeah

478
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,640
cuz I

479
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,460
He can't possibly know the horrible things Alex said about him for days

480
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:57,020
Yeah, it's quite a bit. It's not just they needed to talk. Alex was turning their fight into content

481
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,220
Yeah, but he was monetizing fighting between the two of them

482
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:06,100
Yeah, if you were Joe's friend, wouldn't you be like hey, I saw I know you probably don't have time to see him for us

483
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:11,620
But I saw this online and it's this whole long series of things that Joe said or that Alex said directly about you

484
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,900
You should watch this and remember it forever

485
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:20,300
Let's say that you're a friend of mine and we have a falling out and like maybe you're a high-profile person, too

486
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,300
Mm-hmm. I wouldn't

487
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,620
Have the instinct to threaten to destroy you for attention. Yeah on air

488
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,220
Yeah, that's kind of in that's a bad person

489
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,860
Yeah

490
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,320
If I started my own show like we have a falling out and I start my own show and then all of a sudden

491
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:42,420
You just start going on. I'm gonna kill Jordan rants one. Your show would become far more popular sneaky

492
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,440
Too I would be very offended Dan. Yeah, that would hurt my feelings nonsense. Oh, we just needed to talk. Yeah

493
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,560
Anyway, Alex carries on this charade that like he actually knows anything about what he's talking about

494
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,000
And in this clip we kind of get the first

495
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:04,440
Real meaty thing that I think happens and that is like a full demonstration of why Joe Rogan cannot do the things he's doing

496
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,680
When I get into issues when I'm being serious

497
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,680
I mean, I'm yeah, you can differ on my interpretation

498
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,200
But if I'm saying I've got a clip or I've got something I've got it

499
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,440
Well, that's why I wanted to clear podcast really clearly and I think we accomplished a great job, by the way

500
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,560
I felt terrible that night you pat on the back. You said this will be the best one. You just got proven, right?

501
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,240
I'm surprised almost everything you said was a car

502
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,680
I thought if you there's been mistake and and and you were damn right

503
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,320
My buddy Pat Raleigh was there and he said that was your best podcast with Joe ever. I went home depressed

504
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,040
This is why Joe is not equipped to do the job that he's assigned for himself

505
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,520
Joe didn't fact-check Alex

506
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,320
But he gave just enough of the appearance of doing so to rationalize continuing his association with him

507
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:50,240
Joe could have and should have completely destroyed Alex's career on that podcast

508
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,600
but he didn't have the ammo that he needed to take that shot and because he didn't now that

509
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,560
Podcast gets to be pointed to as a time when Alex's beliefs were really put to the test and he was found

510
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,360
To be correct. Yep

511
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,440
It's just a pathetic display from all parties and I find it difficult to imagine that Joe doesn't have some awareness of what he's doing

512
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,800
And here's what makes me the most convinced of that on that last podcast that they did

513
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,040
Alex presented Joe with information that he was previously unaware of

514
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:23,180
The Rockefeller Foundation had a public plan called operation lockstep that is identical to the current kovat 19 response

515
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:30,400
According to Alex everything that's happening now is planned 10 years ago by these evil globalists and the documents are easily accessible to prove it

516
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:37,320
I do not believe that a sincere person would not finish the podcast and then immediately or at their first opportunity

517
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,320
Check that claim

518
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,320
Alex can either be right or wrong if he's wrong

519
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,280
Your friend is a liar and he's using your platform to spread misinformation

520
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,200
That's gonna get people killed and you're complicit in it if he's right

521
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,080
There's a very easily provable

522
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:57,120
Conspiracy to kill off the population using the illusion of an outbreak and it seems like knowing that for certain would be pretty important

523
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,720
The only thing that really makes sense here is if Joe is treating Alex like Eddie Bravo

524
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,160
It's fun to talk to him about the crazy bullshit

525
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,680
He believes but there's literally no reason to take any of it seriously or think about it for a second outside of his presence

526
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,440
Joe's not gonna dig into whether the earth is flat after hanging out with Eddie and he's not gonna research the fake

527
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,340
Operation lockstep after hanging out with Alex because he takes them equally seriously

528
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,740
Joe probably thinks that what he's doing is fine and innocent enough

529
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,640
But he's doing a lot of damage and doing a bad job while pretending to fact-check Alex

530
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:33,300
Yeah, if you just want to shoot the shit with your friend fine. Once you step into the game of like

531
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:38,800
Validating his conspiracies and pretending that you're doing some kind of rigor or due diligence on this

532
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:46,080
You're giving Alex all the carte blanche to your audience that he needs. Mm-hmm. You're basically selling your audience to him

533
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,680
Yeah, you can't I'd like the first sentence

534
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:54,520
He said is just like we can differ on interpretation and it's like you on some things you can

535
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,560
But there are things that are or are not it's not everything is not

536
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:05,800
Differable on interpretation and then second you always have the documents. Why why would you say that?

537
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,080
Why would you say he always has the documents luck? Is it the joke?

538
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,620
Yeah, I hate it. Yeah. No, it's it's sad. That's pathetic

539
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:19,320
So Alex is a gift for Joe not only the gift of ass kisser II and nonsense

540
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,680
He also has physical gifts. Okay, you've given me a lot of great UFC tickets

541
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,280
But really nice to me for 20 plus years and I've never really gotten you anything

542
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,520
And I've seen people give you gifts on the show using some PR thing that they're selling. I don't know any stock in this

543
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,600
It's a it's a great rifle. I really enjoy it

544
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,840
And so this is something where you can go get four or five grizzly bears

545
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,920
That's so Texas grizzly bears at the same time. What are these rounds? I'm gonna guys bring the rifle in here

546
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,720
So this is your gift along with that box of cigars. You very much. So I got him cigars and rifle like

547
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,860
It's just like a parody of masculinity. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's really that's really bad. Mm-hmm

548
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:00,500
That would be a little bit too on-the-nose in a movie. I would be like, okay guys, we get it

549
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:06,760
They're supposedly men your bros. Yeah. All right. Yeah. This is a man cave. I gotcha. All right

550
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,600
Here's where it gets easy to pull it back. Here's where it gets even worse now remember it

551
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:16,640
They're smoking weed and drinking booze and booze and he is just gifted Joe a rifle right and then Alex says this

552
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,240
It's really wild when you go pick up the rifle and try it out a little bit

553
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,840
Don't you pick try it out? You know what I mean? Just check it out. Let's just put it away

554
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,240
I know what a rifle is. I got a bunch of all right. How Texas is this? That is the right response

555
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,760
Yeah, yeah, that's a good response. I was very I was very afraid because generally whatever info wars

556
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:40,280
Hey pick up that rifle is a of course. I'll pick up that rifle Alex Jones the pinnacle of gun safety

557
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,280
Just the guy who loves the Second Amendment

558
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,480
Responsible gun ownership. Hey, don't shoot it. Don't shoot it. Hey, what are you test out that rifle?

559
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,000
No, give it a go. Give it a go inside. Don't shoot it though. Just swing it around Wow pointed at your friends

560
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,920
so they get to talking about like

561
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,960
sort of meds and medication and

562
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,920
Joe knows some people who have mixed drugs with meds and it's had a bad response. Oh

563
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,200
Some side effects there's different people with different side effects, you know

564
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,760
And and some people are seeing it with things and cocaine, you know, there's a lot of people that say that mixing it with cocaine

565
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,120
Turns you psychotic and oral heart makes life say Xanax. It's not

566
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,560
Terrible for you and a lot of people do it. It's terrible for you

567
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,440
They say don't drink on this people are yeah, okay, and they drink on it, right? The problem isn't the meds though

568
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,660
Yeah, it's yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's the one it's that it's the inverse of what you think is

569
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:43,600
Yeah, I can't do my coke on these meds. No, you're sir, sir. Let me back you up one step

570
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,780
That is what it does kind of seem to me that well, I can't stop doing

571
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,800
Free basin for ten years now and just cuz you want me to take this med. Oh my cholesterol is high

572
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,560
Yeah, fuck you. Mixing booze and Xanax is really dangerous. So people who are on Xanax

573
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,340
Who actually use it as prescribed

574
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:13,660
It's a little bit like you say no, I'm on booze. I'm taking Xanax. Okay, that's that's my recreation. It's very strange

575
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,740
Also, very strange to hear that Joe's position on marijuana is evolving a little bit

576
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:25,560
And I think that's probably good because I I think for everything I could tell there is a little bit of a cartoonish

577
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,140
pro marijuana cartoonish carte blanche of

578
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:36,180
Like like permissiveness to yeah, it's all good. Nothing bad can ever come of we yeah, I think that was kind of a position

579
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:42,540
He may have presented earlier on it's not addictive and you blow the smoke in your four-year-olds face. It's good stuff move on

580
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:49,140
He's now evolved a little bit into a position where it seems like he is is aware that sometimes it can have negative outcomes

581
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:53,140
You know, I've been more and more open over the last few years

582
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:58,940
Especially to recognize that pots not always safe and I don't think it's a good idea to tell everybody it's always safe

583
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:05,140
Well, they made it so strong that it's definitely been connected to increases in schizophrenia. I have no I don't know if it's from the

584
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:11,240
Potency perspective. I think maybe it's always happened and we just didn't

585
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,900
two people

586
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:20,980
Personally who were normal and started smoking a lot of pot and went crazy. I do as well including edibles

587
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:26,740
I know people who have them worked here. One of them started thinking that everyone was reptiles. Wait, that's David. I

588
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,520
Was saying that I got bad news for you

589
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,820
If those people worked it in for us previously, they weren't normal

590
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,700
They weren't starting from like really grounded place and then they started smoking weed

591
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,340
They started listening to me. Yeah. Yeah

592
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:52,000
Sign that this person had lost it is that they thought everyone was reptiles. Yeah when in reality everyone is

593
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,660
interdimensional demons, duh

594
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,660
What are you? What are you high? That's the difference between mental health

595
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:04,140
Losing it is do you think people are reptiles or do you think they're interdimensional demons?

596
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,780
You know what? I don't I don't understand why people would listen to this

597
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:12,980
I don't understand why people would listen to two people have the same dumb thoughts. You could already have at home

598
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,860
Oh, you know no totally like like this is dumb as hell

599
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,740
Like I have thoughts that you can think of at home

600
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:25,560
But it's interesting because you have knowledge and research and shit. Well now we're both just being like, hey

601
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,900
I half remember the content of this thing that I might have read one of the reasons

602
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:36,460
I ultimately decided to do this episode was because I'm looking forward to Monday and we have the

603
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,300
The trip to DC sure for the episode on Monday. Sure

604
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:45,700
I don't know when we'll have time to get to the Rogan episode if not now, of course, and then the other more

605
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:52,600
Motivating factor was that it is something that people are curious about people are curious about like what a four-hour

606
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:57,060
Fucking episode unreal and no one should have to listen to no one. It's so long

607
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:02,380
It's mean there were long stretches where I was listening to this and I'm just like I don't care

608
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:08,220
I don't care. No, cuz cuz there are parts that are just like, okay. This is just a stupid conversation

609
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,460
It's not really relevant

610
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:16,280
Yeah, it's it's not that entertaining just talking about like a fun time you all had or something like Joe

611
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,200
Rogan does like 10 minutes about how great Joey Diaz is as a comedian. He is great

612
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:37,140
There's so much there's like skip and so I'll save people the time I'll listen to it for you

613
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,660
Thank you, and we can just listen to the parts that are interesting like finding out the two of Alex

614
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,420
Oh, there's gonna be a short into the grass. Of course, then they lost their minds, right?

615
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,220
also

616
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:54,900
Alex thinks that he's interviewing Joe kinda. Uh-huh, but the tables turn. Oh, I talk about interdimensional things

617
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,840
That's what the globalists believe in. Have you ever had an interdimensional experience? Here we go

618
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,660
Well, I'm interviewing Joe Rogan

619
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:08,140
Why are we interviewing each other man? No, no, no, we're not I just want to get all the cool stuff out

620
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,180
Let's just talk. Okay, I'll tell you

621
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:17,940
So he did not want to answer that question. He wanted to dodge that if you were an interdimensional experience explain to me how that

622
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,740
Question can blow you away if it's like

623
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,340
I talk about interdimensional stuff. Of course. That's what the globalists believe. Have you ever had one?

624
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:33,020
Because if I say yes, then I would have to admit that I also believe in that shit

625
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,540
And that's kind of probably gonna sound bad

626
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:39,140
It sounds silly for me to say that's what the globalists believe if I've experienced it and I know it's real

627
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:44,140
It kind of makes me look like an idiot that if I say no, then the globalists are just a bunch of

628
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:50,020
Yeah, those who have beliefs that aren't true. Yep. What kind of power is there in that? Not a lot

629
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:55,620
Yeah, kind of a trap. Okay, so Alex doesn't really answer but then he does he does say this

630
00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:02,780
I don't want to make this about me, but I could actually shift into a psychic awareness a psychic awareness

631
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,140
Although the higher level how well do you think you'd do at rock-paper-scissors?

632
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,180
You know, we can joke about that probably pretty good

633
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:22,440
You better win every time exactly I'll give you a minute to shift into your psychic state and you better win

634
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,700
All right, that is full of shit that is huge

635
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,920
You I don't have to do any voices vibe out of this guy. Yes. Yeah, I

636
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,960
Can know I don't know about interdimensional experiences, but I can shift into a psychic state

637
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,440
Maybe I would hope so. Anyway, Alex has a good example of when he has done this in the past

638
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,220
No, but I know how to you know

639
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,500
I let's just say I I wouldn't call the exaggeration

640
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,780
It'll be accelerated to the next power where they claim

641
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:02,500
It's like actual projection or remote viewing right but but I can't control it had a lot of dreams to come exactly true later

642
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,700
And I've called a lot of things like two months for 9-11

643
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,620
I said they're gonna blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on been live what simple said

644
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,940
How did you know how to dream about it kept having a recurring dream? What? Yeah, did you talk about this Larry?

645
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:17,800
Yeah, there's videos over here. No. Yeah, so I can't really control it. Holy shit

646
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,980
So that's amazing. But that's only one data points. It's not amazing. No, it's not we've talked about we did

647
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,980
I think a whole episode about why it's not

648
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:31,140
But like that's that that's just one piece of data. What if he had a second dream that came?

649
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:36,660
Okay kept having this recurring dream of a guy in a pink and green striped sweater. Mm-hmm

650
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:42,260
When I walk around the side of a building attacking me with like a club Bill Gates and and and and as you wear

651
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:47,740
What is it Roger sweaters and we used to drive into town? It was like 15, but with older kids to get alcohol

652
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,620
He had to drive into downtown Dallas to get alcohol and weed

653
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,140
We got a like little crack houses, but we're buying weed on them

654
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:58,720
And then I was going around the side of all these buildings and it was a white crackhead and he tried to attack me

655
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,260
I'd have the exact dream a whole bunch of times and miss when he tried to club me in the head

656
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,980
So it was like it was like it was like my psychic understanding to get past that point

657
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,820
Happened like two months later. I kept having the dream of this guy

658
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:13,180
I'm all sudden walk around this house to buy some weed wasn't a big weed guy, but we're driving out again for girls

659
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:18,260
And this guy tries to club me in the head and crackhead and it's the same guy from the dream. Jesus Christ

660
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,980
Yeah those dreams so you've had two of those big ones. You've had a lot of other ones. Yeah a lot of them

661
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,240
Wow, these are the two examples that he uses though. Holy shit

662
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:31,580
So I guess maybe that was like he'd seen Nightmare on Elm Street

663
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,460
I guess like that's so that's so bullshit

664
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:41,660
Fuck don't I have one rule don't ever tell anybody about your dreams unless it's a sex dream with someone interesting

665
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:47,140
No one else. No one cares about anything else. Yeah, I'm positive that I could come up with some stories

666
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,520
Of dreams I had that I could make match things that happen. Yeah. Yeah

667
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:59,540
Anybody you can fudge the details cuz it's a dream, right? You don't perfectly remember any of this fuck off. Yeah

668
00:44:59,540 --> 00:44:59,860
Yeah

669
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:05,860
So this is the Alex gets back to the 9-eleven prediction and he says something that I actually think is a real problem

670
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,500
Well, there was a two-hour thing. I did it in July 25th

671
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:16,300
2001 I went ahead and went on air and they're gonna blow the World Trade Center blend on the CIS have been live then launch all

672
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:21,300
These wars and and I said, oh I just got this from analysis and information, but I kept having the dream

673
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,340
The towers smoking all the rest of it

674
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:30,300
So what I what I want to point out and take issue with here is that Alex admits that he lied

675
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:37,260
About what the information source was. Yeah, he is saying I said that it was based on analysis

676
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:42,420
But really it was the product of a prophetic dream that I had right because he knew in

677
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,980
2000 that he could not say I had a dream about this

678
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:54,180
That would be very very silly and I would suggest that if this is all true and Alex is being he's reporting

679
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:59,020
this accurately then what happened was he was listening to a ton of Bill Cooper and

680
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:03,900
Patriot ass radio back then and at that point in time it seeped into his subconscious

681
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:09,220
Bill Cooper was saying very similar things and that's why he was dreaming about it

682
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:14,180
Yeah, that's and you combine that with the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center

683
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:19,700
The feelings like bin Laden was somebody who was known at the time

684
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:25,500
Well, and he did say he was going to bomb the World Trade Center. There's that he was very explicit about it

685
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,380
Too like a long time in advance, right?

686
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:35,100
So like Alex's dreams about this or more likely the product of influences that he had sure and then he got on air and

687
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:40,980
Pretended that he was some kind of expert had some analysis and that's kind of a microcosm of his career

688
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,260
Yeah, yeah ending that he has information that he's just coming up with out of his fantasies

689
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:53,180
Yeah, I would say that what he's done is invalidate any time he's ever said that he predicted 9-eleven as being like a result of

690
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:58,420
Work. Yeah, so at best you had a dream you had a dream, right?

691
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:03,400
So then I will so then if you could your entire career is based on a lie

692
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:09,500
Unless you are selling yourself as a pure psychic who can predict things as opposed to analyze them

693
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,660
And it calls into question other times that he said he's analyzed things or he has information

694
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:17,100
Is he actually just lying about the dream? Yeah

695
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:25,140
How seriously should you take any information that he provides if he was willing to pass off a prediction about a terrorist attack as?

696
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:30,660
Analysis when it was actually a dream. Well, he did say Chicago was gonna be nuked. How are we doing? We're fine

697
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:36,140
Oh might have had a dream. Oh shit. We might still be fucked. But he had a dream. Yeah, that sounds about right

698
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,880
So look, this is an interview. Mm-hmm. They're gonna get down to the nitty-gritty

699
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:46,280
They're gonna get down and find out what the truth is unless Joe doesn't want to have an interview. Okay

700
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,360
So what are you in the comedy Oh

701
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,800
Alex this is so forced

702
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,080
What got me in the comedy it is not forced it is

703
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:02,640
Questions like we're doing an interview. No, I'm just because I actually but we're I can talk plenty. Look out. No, I know

704
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:08,080
Let's talk well you don't follow those if you were magically made ruler of the world

705
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,520
Oh, geez, what are three things you would do to change the world as it is?

706
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,040
Alex Jones never does this. I'm being different. I understand

707
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:20,420
I don't think the two of them want to are they're working on the exact same page here. I think no

708
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:28,720
Alex is kind of wanting to get something again. Joe just wants to have a conversation. It's still funny anymore

709
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:35,440
He's charismatic. Yeah, I mean I thought I would I would expect he would go for a joke every now and again

710
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,120
I think he comes off pretty well. Okay, at least all right, okay

711
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:44,200
I think he says a number of really stupid things sure, but at the same time like I you know watching this

712
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,200
I was thinking like I could probably

713
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,400
Hang out with Rogan Wow

714
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,720
I could probably get along with him as long as we didn't get into these sorts of topics. Sure

715
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,340
Sure, I think it might be fun. And as long as it wasn't like a show

716
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:00,240
I mean, I wouldn't want to do like I wouldn't want to be on his show. Yeah

717
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,080
Yeah, just hanging out socially having a conversation. I think he could probably probably be a lot of fun

718
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,120
Definitely hung out and had social conversations in green rooms with far worse people

719
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:16,040
He's able to like Alex you're forcing it why yeah asking a question

720
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:23,240
When did I get into comedy right like yeah that that is that's an indication at least on some level that he's willing to have

721
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:30,320
You know conversation that's not that's true boring. That's true. So but in terms of him being funny. I'm not I'm not a hundred percent sure

722
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,980
But Alex thinks he's funny. How about this kill fucker fight? Oh

723
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,520
Well, I don't want to kill him you're gonna fuck him and I don't want to fight him

724
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,480
I don't want to hurt him. It probably be the most gentle if I fuck him

725
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:53,520
All right, we don't like to keep him alive. No, that's rude that and then you're just making a mockery of it

726
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,520
Oh, you want a personal mama bill? Yes

727
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,520
I

728
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:04,000
You know, I'm trying to feed the memes right now. So desperate. Oh desperate. I get a meme going. That's really bad

729
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,840
Yeah, that's kind of heart-wrenching. Yeah, it's it's

730
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,400
Cringy, it's very cringy

731
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,760
Yeah, especially since he's he's trying to it seems like he's getting so much mileage out of just saying fuck

732
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:21,360
Just like kill fuck fight, you know, you want him to say that it's like it's like a family feud question

733
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,860
We're like you want grandma to say tits. We know it

734
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:30,600
Yeah, there's a little bit of a problem too in that like Joe doesn't seem to hate Bill Gates. Whereas Alex

735
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,480
It claims to know that he runs the world and wants to kill everyone sure

736
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,440
There is Alex doesn't challenge Joe on his non hatred of Bill Gates, which seems weird

737
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:49,600
I'm considering everything Alex says about Bill Gates all the time, but I would have said, you know, he's one of the 12

738
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,680
Maybe he's middle management

739
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,640
That's true when when Alex was on Joe's podcast last it was a disgraceful

740
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,780
Showing, you know, there were just tons and tons of things that were factually inaccurate

741
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,160
emotionally inaccurate

742
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:16,840
And manipulative at the very least. Yes, and you know, we did our episode about it and if anybody's interested they can find

743
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,520
cataloging of them there

744
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:25,400
But Joe seems to think that people were desperate to find something that Alex was wrong about

745
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,360
Let's go ahead and play it's Bill Gates himself saying that the vaccine made 80% of the people ill

746
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,640
Which is exactly what you said on the podcast and people were complaining and they were they were angry

747
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,560
They were trying to find something that you said that was wrong

748
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:46,000
It was so hard as we basically checked everything you said and all that proved to be accurate

749
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,480
so then we got to this part where you said 80% of the people that took the vaccine got sick and people are like he's

750
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:56,780
Spreading anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. So I said, okay. Listen, here's the video

751
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:01,560
We're not desperate to find things that Alex is wrong about it was not a struggle really. No

752
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:13,640
Oh, it's kind of a Google search honestly. Kind of exhausting. It's a bit of a Google search. It was an exhausting cataloging of things that he was wrong about that took for fucking ever

753
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:21,780
But Joe I don't understand how he can possibly not recognize that Alex was lying like that

754
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:27,960
Project lockstep operation lockstep thing is like so glaring that he should never talk to Alex ever again

755
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:35,000
But he seems to think that everybody was so desperate to find one the thing one place where Alex didn't dot his

756
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:42,540
Eye or cross his teeth see this this is a struggle because it does seem like he doesn't take Alex seriously

757
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,160
So, how can you also say that?

758
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,080
You know, that's the conflict that I have like he doesn't take this information seriously. Yeah, obviously

759
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:57,960
So, how can you say that it's proven and then not react to it really like it's a an issue

760
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:04,680
How can you go out of your way to rationalize Alex and sell him to your audience while at the same time?

761
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:12,520
Not taking a step and seeing if his fucking conspiracy about the plan to destroy everyone in the present

762
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,840
Yeah, using kovat 19 has any credence to it?

763
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,880
How could you be that not curious if you're willing to vouch for him? Oh

764
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:28,760
How how could you believe that that stuff has been proven and not use five of your hundred million dollars

765
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:36,240
To do something about it. Yeah yours. He's if you believe what Alex is saying then the elites are killing all of us

766
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,160
Murdering us all and you have a hundred million dollars. You should buy info. You could do something about it

767
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,840
How do you not make that just oh, I'm just a regular old guy just being trampled

768
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:52,600
Down to the machines. Yeah, fuck you. Well, I don't I don't know what his answer to that would be

769
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:58,240
And I don't understand how he can have this completely bizarre relationship with with Alex. Yeah, it's weird

770
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,720
It doesn't make any sense now

771
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:04,320
But I think one of the ways that he's able to play it publicly is to be like yeah

772
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:10,800
Everyone's just mad about things that you say because you're saying them. They're too attached to the messenger

773
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:18,000
Sure, people get trapped into the messenger. They get trapped into the messenger instead of listening to the information a

774
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:25,100
Fucking moron might have something important to say you never know when someone isn't. Thank you Joe

775
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:31,440
Not you, but if someone's an idiot at most things and they come to you with one fact someone could be a fucking liar

776
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:38,000
All the time, but then they come to you with one fact that they saw on TV, you know, get the fuck out of here

777
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,560
That's where crying wolf comes from right? Absolutely knows that a couple of did you learn the wrong lesson from the very story?

778
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,520
You just reference

779
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:45,800
Yeah

780
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:52,000
the lesson supposed to be like in that story is that when you cry wolf a bunch of times and there is no wolf people will

781
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Not believe you

782
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:01,720
The lesson of that story isn't that the people who stop believing someone who constantly lied about there being a wolf or wrong to

783
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,400
Not believe him the last time that's a completely bizarre

784
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:10,680
Interpretation of that story the takeaway is supposed to be that if you're a liar and the lies you're telling affect other people

785
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:15,440
You can cause serious damage to people with your lies because the time you're telling the truth about a threat

786
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:21,160
They might not believe you. Uh-huh. Alex is kind of the boy who cried wolf except in his version

787
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,540
There still isn't a wolf at the end

788
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:29,400
He's just continuing to lie and the boy is getting rich selling anti wolf pills to a particularly gullible set of people in town

789
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:35,880
Yeah, there's an issue there. Also. This is a critically important point Joe is saying that people cannot hear the things

790
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,520
Alex says and evaluate them on their merits because they're caught up in the messenger

791
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,020
They hate Alex and so he must be wrong about everything

792
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:48,560
This is exactly the problem with how Joe engages with Alex just in the reverse

793
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:55,080
It's Joe who's completely caught up on the messenger and refuses to accept the possibility that Alex is a malignant narcissist

794
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:01,680
Who is not his friend. I hate Alex Jones more than most people and I can easily separate my feelings about how repulsive

795
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,580
He is from whether or not specific claims he makes are based in reality

796
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:11,040
It's not a difficult exercise because I care because I believe that there's a reason that this matters

797
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:17,680
For all Joe's talk about ideas and good ideas beating bad ideas. He doesn't think any of this shit

798
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,080
He's talking about matters

799
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:24,040
He's trapped by the illusion in his head that he's created where Alex is a good guy who means well

800
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:29,880
Which he only believes because the two of them have gotten fucked up together a couple times and said offensive things to each other

801
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,720
Which is bonding I guess and Alex gave him a rifle cigars, too

802
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:38,840
I challenge Joe to take his own of advice and separate the messenger from the message

803
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:46,360
Start with operation lockstep and go from there and consider the possibility that this person you insist is your friend is actually a dangerous liar

804
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,640
Yeah, I do. I mean it to your point. Yeah. Okay, Joe

805
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,720
Then do you watch like the other conservative news networks whenever they say all that bullshit?

806
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,960
Do you go? Well, obviously I must believe them because it's true

807
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,920
That's the only because they're not that no that's that's so fucked up

808
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:10,600
He's absolutely tied to the to just I will defend Alex no matter what. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's

809
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,600
sucks

810
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:18,480
Well, I mean it kind of sucks, but it also is really gaslighting to say people who yeah like disagree

811
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:25,440
But can't possibly have substance-based reasons for disagreeing. We just hate Alex all about it's all about your feelings

812
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,160
It's always it's he's creating this archetype of like all criticism is coming from

813
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:38,060
SJW snowflakes who are all mad because Alex Jones is too manly or something sure and then like it that's so

814
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:44,540
Boring, you're like trafficking in this like fetishization of ideas and that's the idea you have

815
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:51,780
Well, what it is we've done 500 something episodes of this podcast about substance. Yeah, that's wrong with Alex Jones

816
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:58,020
It's not I don't I'm not just mad at him. Yeah, we would have stopped a long time ago. I was just mad at him

817
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,180
Yeah, yeah, it's such bullshit Joe

818
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:07,500
It's it's just like with Alex's fears of and then being like on the other side and he wants those things to happen

819
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:11,940
It's what he's afraid of is the things that he desires in the same way

820
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:16,740
Joe is what he's really expressing is I react to things based on how I feel

821
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:23,260
So I assume that others react to things based on how they feel. I can't imagine them

822
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:31,100
Breaking free of the the mold that I exist in because obviously if I have a hundred million dollars the things I think are important

823
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:38,100
They're not just feelings that I have or fucking fake prophetic ass dreams that I have that must be where their

824
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:44,880
Criticism comes from as well. Yeah, and I mean Joe even gets into this kind of thing a little bit later here

825
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,640
I'll even go to this. I'll jump forward a little bit because it's really relevant

826
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:53,400
I'll go to this clip here because he's talking about like how people shape their ideas

827
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:59,880
And I think that this might be how he has right or it feels like projecting

828
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:05,240
This is the thing. It's like like you you're allowed to have other ideas

829
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:09,800
But the whole idea of who you are and what life is is

830
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:15,040
Mostly shaped by what you think is gonna give you the least resistance from the people that are around

831
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:20,320
But that's the Liberals always liked was the fact that they were open and free and believed in speech

832
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:25,280
And even though I disagree with them on some points they agree with my overall freedom. I'm so high

833
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,880
I don't even know what I just said. You said something really smart

834
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:37,780
I agree. I'm a bullshitter. So I know that Joe's discounting his own point because he's all high and shit, but the the

835
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,040
Presumption that you mold your identity by with that which

836
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:51,080
Ideas these ideas that will cause the least tension with the people around you. Mm-hmm. That's not how everyone lives

837
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:56,480
No, that's not very much personal experience. A lot of times your personality is formed by conflict

838
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,080
It's formed by tension

839
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:04,960
with groups that you don't fit in with having to find new people that you get along with better because

840
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:12,680
That's that's nonsensical. Yeah. Yeah, I I can't handle this. I get it

841
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,640
There's ideas and you can look at things from a different way

842
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:20,640
But we also have to exist in a world where some things are and some things are not

843
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:27,280
Mm-hmm. Everything is not open to interpretation. No, it just can't be otherwise we get places where it's like

844
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,760
We think there's voter fraud

845
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:35,160
So there was no things at there at a certain point something is or is not we can't live in a no

846
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:40,680
This is just how I interpret things like that's just not how we can share a universe. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard

847
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:44,680
Yeah, but I will say that they're modeling it for us

848
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:51,040
Here with Alex and Joe. That's why it's so shitty. They're two completely different people and they're getting along

849
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:56,040
They voted for different people. Did you know that Rogan didn't vote for Trump? What?

850
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:01,840
Listen, I voted for Joe Jorgensen. I voted for the libertarian because I think we should probably

851
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,040
You know, I'm voting out of California

852
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:11,040
So I'm like we should support third-party candidates because that's one of the solutions. I'd love to grill him on Jorgensen's position

853
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:16,720
God, I want to slap him so bad. I kind of how fucking dare you

854
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,920
I mean, I guess it doesn't really matter since it's California

855
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,920
Yeah, I I would love to see how much he knows about Joe George totally

856
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,420
That's just some fake ass

857
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:33,360
Like I'm so I look I don't agree with what Trump does and I don't like the way he does it

858
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:40,560
But listen, I can't support the Democrats cuz I'm an iconoclast. I'm Joe fucking Rogan. You don't know shit

859
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:46,760
I would have voted Democrat if they got Tulsi Gabbard. Yeah, right fuck off you fucking screw you

860
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:53,620
So again, I often feel like we're gonna get hit with the DMCA complaint and have like copyright

861
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:57,880
Claims put on our episodes big in cyberpunk 2077

862
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:03,440
All right, people are saying that you have to turn DMCA music off. Otherwise the twitch will kick you off

863
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,340
Oh, no, you'll get kicked off, but we're fine. Oh are we so again?

864
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:11,780
Thanks for watching and back to this exclusive in-depth Joe Rogan interview

865
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:16,800
Which is free to air all you can re-upload it. You can clip it out. You can make memes out of it

866
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:22,200
It's all copyright free the Alex show show and everything we do at info Wars calm

867
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,680
See, this is the double-edged sword of his desperation for memeing

868
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:30,680
It is a little bit is that he has to give blanket permission to people like us to be

869
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:36,240
Easy so I guess we're safe. All right, buddy. Yeah, so that was from a little

870
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,340
commercial that Alex inserted in of course

871
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:46,600
Of course he did. Why wouldn't he you gotta make money? Yeah, I don't actually even remember what this is about

872
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,840
This next clip. I doubt they do either. Oh, no now I remember

873
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,200
So they're talking about Joe's dog and how great this golden retriever is. Oh my god

874
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:00,960
Is Alex gonna kill his dog on air? I was worried about that. The rifle is right there. I know! He's swinging it around!

875
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,200
The dog isn't there

876
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:10,480
But they talk about how great Joe's dog is and the dog smiles and loves Joe and Alex gets mad because he starts thinking

877
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:16,520
about how like, you know some animal psychologists will say like what you think of as

878
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,160
happiness in an animal isn't always

879
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:28,040
Happiness. Right. A smile on a dog isn't necessarily happiness in the same way it is for humans. Alex gets kind of mad about this

880
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:36,000
That is a microcosm of his relationship to animals is his relationship to people. I don't understand why you don't think me! You're all

881
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:43,140
You're all nature. None of its nurture. Well, but but that's then but then they say they are up here though

882
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:50,600
They have souls. They have minds. They have decisions. Just you don't. He's talking about like the elites of psychiatry and what have you.

883
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,160
And it's an ultimate. They're in the lower class. We're in the lower class.

884
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,640
Elitism. What existed before the Germans and then in modern psychiatry and psychology

885
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:04,400
200 years ago, and so that's what I'm coming at here is it doesn't mean that the things they've created the list

886
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,240
They've made aren't real human traits

887
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:12,600
But it's really a cult a gill blocking us from the larger issue because your dog is magic. Your dog does have a soul

888
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:19,120
It does have an energy. It is smiling. You are interfacing. Dogs are psychic buffers way more psychic than we are

889
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:25,900
And so I'm saying is your dog is is the example of what humanity is to go towards instead of somebody like Bill Gates

890
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:30,020
Yeah, we should be less like Bill Gates and more like Rogan's dog. Jesus

891
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:37,040
Just it's meaningful. It's meaningful stuff. Just scream out. I don't want to learn that

892
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:43,060
That how dare they say something different than me? Well, like I'm not threatened by

893
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:48,640
Someone telling me that my cat smiling doesn't mean she's happy. Oh shit. What is it? What does it mean?

894
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:55,400
I'm not next question. I'm not threatened by the idea that her purring isn't always like showing love or happiness

895
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,960
How can I make it better right and I also don't question

896
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:03,880
The bond that we have like I'm not tied up in

897
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:08,860
Nope, if a psychiatrist said that that cat doesn't feel everything you think it's feeling all the time

898
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:15,520
That's because you don't have a soul. I'm not invested in projecting my feelings on to my pet friend

899
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:22,660
Yeah, I don't understand why people I don't know. I don't care. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's it's a thing

900
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:29,420
So Joe has been pretty shitty so far about the idea that people have valid criticism

901
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:35,180
Criticism right about Alex right right and in this next clip. I think this is like I really resent this

902
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:39,220
Listen, Alex, you got to think of what it's like to be a 23 year old kid

903
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:44,820
Who is friends with a bunch of other 23 year old kids that espouse a very rigid?

904
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:48,860
Ideology and when someone deviates from this ideology

905
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:55,580
Ideology and says maybe the guy's not a bad guy. Maybe he had like a psychotic moment. Maybe he had a bad time

906
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:59,560
Maybe maybe he believed it because he's seen so much

907
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,740
Bullshit, he's seen so many lies and maybe went crazy

908
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:11,460
Maybe you went crazy cuz he's on his own and because nobody wants to stand up and say hey

909
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:14,060
He's right about a lot of shit. So

910
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:19,540
He seemed like the the thing that he's saying is like psychotic is like a sandy hook stuff

911
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:26,940
Yeah, but like what Joe is presenting is this idea that like the only people who are really critiquing Alex or?

912
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:32,980
23 year olds who are socially uncomfortable with the fear that they have of saying hey

913
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:35,580
Maybe Alex is right about something. Yeah, that's

914
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:40,560
Ridiculous. Yeah. Yeah, that's very frustrating and and angering and

915
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:48,540
almost suggests a sort of distance from what people really live that could only really come about through a

916
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,540
hundred million dollars

917
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:58,020
And it's straw man straw man techniques in terms of like this is why people have a problem with you

918
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:00,900
It's because all their 23 year old friends are in a rigid

919
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,980
ideology it's it's crazy how I'm not even going to mention that maybe

920
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:09,900
People of color or women might have critiques of you. It's actually

921
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,860
23 year old men who are

922
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:19,920
Scared hurting their friends feeling. Yeah. Yeah by saying fuck you Alex has all those it's all those non

923
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:26,420
alpha men who aren't carrying a gun right now and smoking cigars and whining about how people don't respect

924
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:32,260
everything that we believe without questioning us like alphas do and the real problem is

925
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,300
That Alex got left out in the wilderness

926
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:41,020
That's the real problem even if you're wrong rather about some things

927
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:44,860
I meant well, you're a human being and your perspective is valuable

928
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:49,900
And one of the reasons why you were wrong about such things is because you were abandoned

929
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:56,420
There was so many people that didn't want to hitch their car up to your train because they were scared

930
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:59,860
They would get caught in the 9-11 conspiracy in the Bohemian Grove

931
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:07,980
Conspiracy and the fucking Bilderberg conspiracy. There was so many different things that led people down uncomfortable moments and uncomfortable

932
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:12,860
Conversations, they didn't want to be a part of it. So they just left you alone and

933
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,500
when people get

934
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:19,760
Abandoned by all of the other people around them that may

935
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:26,060
Possibly have an inkling that you are correct. You start going fucking crazy

936
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:30,260
Yeah, that look on your face was amazing. I'm so fucking mad

937
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:35,740
I'm so mad at that this okay. Okay, fine. I get it

938
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:40,500
We've all seen Good Will Hunting, you know, it's great to give the pep talk speech

939
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:45,020
But you know that was that was fucking Matt Damon as like a underappreciate

940
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:50,700
This is like giving that same pep talk speech to John Wayne Gacy and being like look a lot of people just don't

941
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:57,860
Understand why you're doing what you're doing man, but they're just not ready to challenge themselves. I I disagree here

942
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:01,380
Here's what I think. Mm-hmm. It would be like John Wayne Gacy

943
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:07,520
I haven't killed all those people. Yes, and then someone his friend being like look, you know

944
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:12,620
The problem was that you didn't have friends around you telling you not to dress up like a clown

945
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,220
You were abandoned

946
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:22,100
Didn't have people around you telling you not to report on Sandy Hook like that

947
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:28,260
Even though we have I don't know a deposition of Paul Joseph Watson saying I told him not to do this

948
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:31,420
There was that yeah, this is there was that this is this some bullshit

949
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:35,580
We were trying to make it not Alex's fault. They had done every bad thing. He's done in his career

950
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,700
These are the people who bitch about

951
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,300
participation trophies

952
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:46,260
This is the most like hey look just cuz you failed a million times

953
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:53,700
Upwards to the tune of millions of dollars now doesn't mean you're not still great. It's participation trophies and personal

954
01:09:53,700 --> 01:10:01,100
responsibility and ideas like these people who think that's all they keep repeating and over and over and over again and

955
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:06,340
Here you have like Alex. It's not your fault. People just left you people just people left you on your own

956
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:11,480
And that's why you had to say that people were crisis actors who were grieving for their dead family members

957
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:15,660
yourself starting to think a lot of people's criticisms of

958
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:21,620
Entitled white men are right on. Yeah, but I'm probably just a 23 year old is worried

959
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:27,420
It could be that three-year-olds around me that it could be that you're right. Yeah, so when you are

960
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:33,060
Hearing something like Alex saying that he's not using Joe for exposure

961
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:36,060
How would you hear that?

962
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:39,340
Like a punch to the face and here's the deal

963
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:43,520
I'm not using you in this interview, but you're so big and the system

964
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:48,540
Likes wants to watch what you're doing so I can get messages through when you're on the show

965
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:50,860
so one of the things I wanted to say to the left is

966
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,220
I

967
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:56,040
Don't know about the left the average left person left us cool. I

968
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:59,620
Hear Alex say I'm not using you

969
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:06,140
But I know that more people will listen because you're here as him saying I'm using you now

970
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:11,700
I don't understand how you could be friends with Alex for this long without

971
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,480
Finding out his rhetorical trick of saying I'm not doing

972
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:22,840
But and then doing the thing yeah, because literally he does that every time Alex's son named his show

973
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,840
I'm not bragging as a joke

974
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:32,360
Exactly. I'm not doing this. I'm not using you. I'm doing this means. I'm using you

975
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:38,860
Yeah, every reason that I then explained. I don't hang out with him real life only on the context of this show

976
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:46,220
So occasionally yeah, uh and I picked up on that real fast, so I kept this clip in just because it's like

977
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,780
I think it's kind of indicative of

978
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:54,500
Some stretches of this episode where it's like what I was talking about earlier. It's like yeah, this is boring

979
01:11:54,580 --> 01:12:00,380
Yeah, this is just them having a conversation that I don't care about but it goes on

980
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,700
You ever have a Kopi luat coffee

981
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:06,780
No, oh my god

982
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,140
That's

983
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:13,860
Not even a real razorback though Kopi luat coffee is coffee that comes from a civet

984
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:17,860
So the civet eats the coffee bar craps and shits them out

985
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:21,860
And then people collect them and clean them up and then sell them

986
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:27,800
And it makes the best fucking coffee ever when you said about tried it. I've heard of it. It's so good

987
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:31,780
It's really good

988
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:37,500
Like it's it's a cat like a civet is kind of a cat. It's like real close

989
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:43,320
By the way do you have a photograph of a civet by the way you have a ragdoll catch

990
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,820
Yeah

991
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,820
Hold on. Let's look at a civet

992
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:54,900
Now I was trying to stalk you but but but I watched the show a lot today, and I'm going hey

993
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:59,460
You've got ragdoll catch tell Joe you've got him so I didn't know you had right this week this week

994
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:03,980
I was smart well. They're really relaxed pretty blue eyes. Yeah, there's your civet

995
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:08,180
yeah, so that animal shits out coffee beans and

996
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:16,460
Then it's super expensive. It's called Kopi luat. I've heard of it. Yeah, so is it really good

997
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:20,340
It's really good Wow

998
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:26,760
Great I've been on road trip. I've been on road trips with comics before yeah, and there is one

999
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:32,100
I will remember forever because the two people in the back just started having such a boring

1000
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:35,780
Conversation while I was driving. I drove so much faster

1001
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:39,260
Just cuz their conversation was boring

1002
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:47,260
That is the worst. I would I would literally stop being friends with people who had that conversation

1003
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:48,420
Yeah, I was listening to that

1004
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:53,780
And I just sort of whoa there was a couple points and that was one of them where I was just sort of like rubbing

1005
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:59,940
My temples Wow don't know what's going on. I got guys this this is what this is on purpose

1006
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,940
It's gonna stop the global

1007
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:05,460
You can edit things

1008
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:11,240
Well Joe has a big message that he wants to get across on this episode and that is that we need to get rid of

1009
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,700
tribalism and when he says tribalism

1010
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:18,340
He's talking about the idea of looking at everybody as teams like Democrats Republicans

1011
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:22,360
We need to get over that and start looking at each other as people who have ideas

1012
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:26,960
And look at the ideas that each other have and if I have a better idea than your idea

1013
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:32,360
Then my idea will win and you will then have my idea all I hear is I would like people to stop

1014
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,040
Criticizing rich white men maybe that could be it

1015
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:42,280
We are dealing with the remnants of a savage past when people kill people with stone

1016
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,600
Axe tools and now we do it with chemtrails and vaccines

1017
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:50,200
Slow down my point is

1018
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,560
Is

1019
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:55,480
We're connected with this idea that we have to

1020
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,160
absolutely have to

1021
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:04,700
Be in opposition with each other. I don't think I'm sure bloods. That's dumb. It's nonsense

1022
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,540
That's the weakness. The weakness is not like

1023
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,920
flip-flopping or

1024
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:16,640
Reconsidering your opinions. The real weakness is the really thinking that people that are just

1025
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:23,280
Marginally different from you in terms of the way they look at things that those people your enemy

1026
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,440
We have to stop seeing each other as the enemy, but that's what I want. Just

1027
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:30,120
Talk, do you know who you're talking to?

1028
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:36,800
Alex spends all of his time talking about how his imaginary enemies are like working for the literal devil

1029
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:44,800
Yeah, like this is a fine point that he's making but it's farcical to be making it while sitting next to Alex fucking Jones

1030
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:49,500
Like hey, you know what you should do after this. You should ask him what he thinks about Democrats

1031
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,360
What does he think?

1032
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:56,200
He thinks they're all demons. He thinks that they're literally possessed by demons

1033
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:03,960
Yep. Wow. Yeah Wow. Oh my god. I mean sure it's a it's a it's a fine thought the

1034
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,400
Alex does agree with him

1035
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,640
he would like that to be the

1036
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:14,300
Perfect world and it can only come about in an all-white nation

1037
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,820
It seems like that's kind of the tribalism that I would like to Christian. Yeah

1038
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:27,200
On those tribalism parts that he kind of focuses on maybe those tribalism parts are the worst ones

1039
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:31,280
No, we start with we have to overcome it though as Joe is

1040
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:37,860
Very repetitively pointing. Thanks. I think the thing that is

1041
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,860
most

1042
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,560
Difficult to overcome in our pursuit

1043
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:48,800
For the understanding of the reality of the universe white male hedge money behavior. Oh

1044
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:55,820
That there's a team that's in opposition to you and your beliefs which are righteous and true and good

1045
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:01,320
But if I don't have tribalism somebody's gonna overtake me so I don't like tribalism as a necessary evil

1046
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:08,640
Like I don't want a government that I need a strong enough government that has limited government to protect me from try radical governments, right? I understand

1047
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:16,220
I think maybe the solution is an understanding of tribalism and then an agreement to never engage in it and

1048
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:20,900
When people do engage in it, you should look at those people as being foolish

1049
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:25,740
I agree, so we need a lot of good versus bad. Yeah positive versus sin

1050
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:32,800
Look not the Christian cosmology of sin. What is a sin against humanity? I think lying I think being a chicken shit

1051
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:38,120
I think me a coward. Yeah. Yeah, so what's evil Alex?

1052
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:41,620
I find you guilty of your own sins against humanity

1053
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:46,660
You know what? I love to listen to two dumber people have a

1054
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:49,680
Conversation that was famous for happening

1055
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,680
2,500 years ago

1056
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,680
This is the exact... what are we doing?

1057
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:06,220
This is the problem with so much like online based discourse and like the the whole the sort of

1058
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:10,020
Debates that happen like among people who are self-taught

1059
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:10,420
Yeah

1060
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:15,480
Like she was good a lot of the times you don't realize that these ideas that you think are so

1061
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:19,080
Revolutionary are things you might encounter in your first year in college

1062
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:23,900
Yeah, like there is so much past these points that they're getting to where their minds are blown

1063
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:29,060
But also I mean like I would take Rogan like as a good faith actor sure

1064
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:32,780
Sure, and I would say that okay. Now. This is interesting. Okay now

1065
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:39,780
There we go Joe you are on the right track buddy

1066
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:44,740
Now what does it mean for you to say that we should disincentivize people to act tribally

1067
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:50,140
And then if people do begin to act tribally we should look at them as fools. Yes

1068
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:56,220
it means that how is society organized and what we need to do is

1069
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,140
Give people a fine

1070
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:04,100
For engaging in behavior with groups larger than a thousand wait wait

1071
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:07,620
So now we have to have a fine for being foolish for being a fool

1072
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:12,620
This is not enforceable in any way

1073
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:18,220
And if you tried it would get so out of hand

1074
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:23,260
It would be absolutely used to crack down on vulnerable populations trying to band together

1075
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:29,360
But they don't think about that because they've never been the vulnerable population getting cracked down on but they do think that they are of course

1076
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,380
They guess they're conservatives who are so fucking shadow banned

1077
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:38,860
You know the reason I used to here's what I used to think that has just been blown away by this very conversation

1078
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:44,580
the reason I thought people who have spent their entire lives studying this type of thing having a

1079
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:49,260
Conversation and that becoming popular the reason I thought the the thing that blocked that for me

1080
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:52,220
I thought was that it would be too dry. It would be too

1081
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:57,460
Boring, you know, but this conversation is more boring than anything I can think of

1082
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:05,060
Yeah, this is tragically boring and more people are gonna watch that then two people who've spent their entire life studying these questions

1083
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:10,380
Yeah, I have I don't know it's tough for me to say because I guess I'm not a normal person

1084
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,940
Necessarily and I am you know, 36

1085
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:18,100
I'm on a different period of my life is maybe the target demographic of Joe Rogan. Sure

1086
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:21,480
But like 23 year old meatheads, I suppose. Yeah

1087
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,540
Who are afraid of yeah

1088
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:30,440
I think a lot of people think of like college lectures and like academic conversation to be really boring

1089
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:37,640
But this is fucking boring. This is incredibly boring. Yes, and the difference is if you engage with the academic stuff

1090
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:41,440
You probably learn something. It's amazing. You're not gonna learn anything from this

1091
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:45,480
No other than I think Joe's a little bit disappointed in Alex

1092
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:45,720
Yeah

1093
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:50,280
because when when Joe's talking about this need to overcome tribalism and Alex is like

1094
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,480
I need my tribe to fight back against any other it try

1095
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:57,020
Yeah, I think there's a sense of Joe being like you don't get it

1096
01:20:57,020 --> 01:21:03,300
You don't get the higher-level thing that I'm imagining. Yeah granted what he's imagining is a stupid

1097
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:13,220
But he has no idea how to attain you just can't see my flying Pegasus world and it's disappointing to me

1098
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:14,740
Yeah, no

1099
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:19,820
But despite all that disappointment, I mean the two of them are friends and we can prove it

1100
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:23,980
Well, yeah, like two years later. We shot a video. Yeah during the contested election

1101
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:28,580
Making fun of the bushes. Well you and I dressed up I dressed up like

1102
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:35,460
See, I just have a junior junior senior. Yeah, and I was in a wheelchair and we

1103
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:38,100
Went running around

1104
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:45,060
Was the capital the capital and we smoked a little weed allegedly every single time these two talk this story comes up

1105
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:50,520
Wow, which leads me to suspect that maybe there aren't that many memories. Yeah, that kind of suggests maybe

1106
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,140
Maybe

1107
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,820
They got high and ran around the capital and masks

1108
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:55,460
You know

1109
01:21:55,460 --> 01:22:00,820
I think that the basis like the stories for any friendship and that you that you share

1110
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:07,520
Should not be I guess you had to be their stories, you know, because this story is one where I'm like, I

1111
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:11,980
Maybe if I was there it would be funny, but this is no

1112
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:17,340
I mean, I've seen it they videotaped it cool. I've watched it was still 20 years ago. Yeah. Yeah

1113
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:20,860
Oh, I mean I you've had experiences like that with friends

1114
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:27,200
You can extrapolate like how much fun that much sure sure and it was like, you know, 99 2000

1115
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,540
It's just you're free, you know, like it's such a different time

1116
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:35,460
Maybe a few years. Yeah, I

1117
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:43,020
Just think it's kind of depressing. Yeah, I've heard this on other podcasts to like people who only have one story

1118
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:49,540
Yeah, and every time this guest is on that story comes up. Yes. It's like, huh? Yeah get a new story guys live

1119
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:58,220
Stop talking and live. Yeah, so in this next clip we get again another thing another instance of this

1120
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:02,620
mentality that Alex has where he wants to be like

1121
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:07,860
Rogan with this like yeah, we need to get rid of all this tribalism stuff, but I also need mine

1122
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:15,680
Yeah, well, yeah, I don't have a hundred million dollars and and this is this is Alex expressing that like, you know

1123
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:18,180
His nationalism is basically a cult

1124
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:22,980
Yeah, but he needs that call well because he imagines that his enemies are also a cult

1125
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:26,660
Well, and so he needs his call to fight their call. But yeah, I'm

1126
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:30,140
Creating my own enemy in order to destroy myself

1127
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:35,820
I don't understand what you don't understand and I'm creating my own enemy to justify really fucked up things

1128
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:41,620
I want exactly we have to use our own nationalism which has failed and has problems and it's cultic

1129
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:47,300
But our cults better than their cult humans organizing cults. It's our nature. I agree. We should transcend it

1130
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:51,420
You're at that point Joe. I can see up on the mountain. I get where you're going

1131
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,900
I'm just saying well, you're in a crisis though

1132
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:54,940
It's like the lower brain

1133
01:23:54,940 --> 01:24:00,980
It is the nationalist called a free market money and family and God and runs and everything

1134
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:05,780
It's gonna counter the chai comms where man you work 18 hours a day if you complain your ass is dead

1135
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:08,500
yeah, because the global model is communist China and

1136
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:11,800
All I'm saying is they're taking over. So what do we do about that?

1137
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:21,620
Good response Joe first of all, whenever you're in a situation where you're coming at me

1138
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:24,740
for global advice

1139
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:31,860
We got real problems. I think there's a humility in Joe's response. I appreciate that, you know, like come on

1140
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:35,900
Why the fuck are you asking me for a solution now? Unfortunately?

1141
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:41,780
He does continue and give an idea. Well, I mean he can't not and he should have stopped it

1142
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:44,160
You shouldn't ask me because this is dumb

1143
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:48,640
But honestly, I do look at it like when you say like what do we do about it?

1144
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:52,740
If you could wave a magic wand

1145
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:58,340
You'd make them all do mushrooms all of them. Just all of them

1146
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:03,300
Everybody anybody in a position of power anybody locked into an ideology

1147
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:11,060
Anybody who believes nonsense anybody who believes things that they know aren't true clean

1148
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:16,820
But they'll fight for them. Do you know people that know that the things they believe aren't true? How dare you?

1149
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,940
They'll get angry you and how dare you there's a weird

1150
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:27,180
How fucking dare you that if more people took hallucinogens they would but but then someone go crazy someone go crazy

1151
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:34,260
Yeah, yeah, some kids break their legs. You see like an Islamic leader. You can tell they've never taken it. What? Wow

1152
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:39,820
What? Wow, what? Yeah, no, no Muslims have ever tripped or something

1153
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:46,740
This is I mean, this is embarrassing. That's spectacular. This is like Joe Rogan's like 50 no

1154
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:51,420
No, no, he is late 40s. He did somebody's got to be true

1155
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:59,300
He is something I never thought anyone could do which is he took the four ways to learn and really condensed it still further

1156
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:05,660
Down one one way fungus mushrooms. Yeah. All right. All right. So here's how we solve Israel, Palestine

1157
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:10,780
He's gonna be like great. That's gotta be like a joke. It's gotta be his brand. Yeah

1158
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:18,380
I mean, yeah, you could really know. No, he's just doing like I imagine if your job is to essentially be high all the time

1159
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:22,140
You know, yeah, you've got to lean into it, you know

1160
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:27,500
Benson didn't stop doing weed jokes just cuz he got to 50 plus right, you know

1161
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:32,500
I've done mushrooms and it is a fun experience, you know, and under the right circumstances

1162
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:37,180
Sure. I also know a lot of shitheads who've done a lot of mushrooms. Yes

1163
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:43,940
It doesn't it they are all for universal basic income. I don't know if they are it does not solve anything

1164
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:49,260
It's not a miracle cure. No, it's not like oh if you're living in a contradiction you take mushrooms. It's

1165
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:55,580
That's how it always works. Kind of hippie-dippie bullshit is every story that I've ever heard about

1166
01:26:56,300 --> 01:27:04,260
Hallucinogenics has been oh man. It's straightened out my political philosophy. Huh? That's what it did made sure all those

1167
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:09,300
Inconsistencies I had in my head just went away resolved everything

1168
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:16,980
Hey, what was the thing that I thought most on my trip was just like a progressive tax policy does work as intended

1169
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:22,880
I expect this like in a bong circle with a guy coming out of the mouth of someone wearing like

1170
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:25,460
blown glass necklace on a

1171
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:32,140
Braid, you know, that's what I expect. I don't expect this out of a hundred million mayor

1172
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:35,580
Yeah, yeah, who's almost 50 she's have some dignity

1173
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:41,420
What he didn't get to be a hundred millionaire by having dignity or learning things

1174
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:44,660
He got to a hundred million by being a guy who took shrooms

1175
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:57,060
Especially the people who believe things that aren't true like the person I'm sitting right next to why do we always make the people most?

1176
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:02,460
Deserving as of a slap to the face of the most famous and rich people available and good at martial arts

1177
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:10,040
This next clip Alex reveals that he's probably taken some hallucinogens

1178
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:17,060
He might have even done acid with Joey be a watch out or he got dosed by Joey Diaz and pissed his pants one

1179
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:22,380
Where the other one was that you have you invited me to in Houston like eight nine years ago with Joey Diaz

1180
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,840
Well, didn't you guys allegedly do acid allegedly?

1181
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,840
Well

1182
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:30,560
No, let's go back Joey Diaz

1183
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:35,340
Joey Diaz hands me a cookie in Houston

1184
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,500
Couldn't get out of the chair

1185
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,500
I'm sitting I'm watching the whole day

1186
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:58,420
That's where God did we go to dinner that night we did yeah, I was like crawling around the ground and you couldn't

1187
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:03,540
Pillar of Christianity

1188
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:09,760
Destroyer of globalists. Yep. I who got dosed by Joey Diaz and pissed his pants at a UFC fight

1189
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:12,000
Alex Jones

1190
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,320
See now that's where I would like to be

1191
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:22,360
I want to see Joey Diaz roast Alex while he's tripping. That would be hilarious

1192
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:28,700
I can't I can't provide that while he's tripping but there was a time like way back when Joey Diaz came to

1193
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:33,960
Infowars Studios with Rogan. I did not know that. Yeah, we can cover that in a future episode

1194
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:40,320
Like a good one. I like a good DS. It's really tough though because he's screaming at Alex. Well, that sounds right

1195
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,400
It's something that I've always thought about like, yeah, maybe we'll do that for an episode

1196
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:50,040
But I remember way back. I tried to prepare it and it was just like holy shit. This is incoherent

1197
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,920
But maybe

1198
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,560
My pants

1199
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:04,440
I dosed Alex with way too much THC and he smells like piss

1200
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:17,440
Anyway in this next clip Joe, this is this is another instance where I take him to task

1201
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:24,520
I think that this is him revealing what his goals were with having Alex on his podcast

1202
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:27,840
Mm-hmm, and I would say that this is not what he does

1203
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,960
One of the goals that and this is real

1204
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:34,840
one of the goals that what I wanted to achieve is

1205
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:41,680
To have people consider that there's people that have wildly different ideas that you do that may be good guys

1206
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:47,960
so there's maybe these people that have ideas of you and I wanted them to consider that maybe

1207
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:54,680
That's a good guy. And if you and Alex were hanging out with me and Eddie Bravo

1208
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:59,480
And we were all in a room together. We would be fucking laughing. We would be laughing hard

1209
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:04,400
We'd be having a lot of fun. We'd be it would be fun. It'd be ridiculous

1210
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:10,020
And if you're not in that room, it's easy to judge. Well, guess what guess who's not in that room

1211
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:14,960
The millions of people who are watching. Yeah, you're you're saying like oh, yeah

1212
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:20,080
I just wanted to show that it's a fun experience to hang out with Alex Jones. Mm-hmm. But meanwhile

1213
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,200
The people who are watching aren't gonna have that fun experience

1214
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:30,200
What they are going to see is me fumble and accidentally validate all of the lies that he's trying to disseminate

1215
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,640
Yeah, and hey, man

1216
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:36,760
Like I don't know I was Paul pot a fun guy to drink with could you have done a podcast with him?

1217
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:40,720
Like I know that's probably an extreme example, but like yeah, okay

1218
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:47,520
Yeah, you can get along with people who are like gerbils. Yeah fun. I don't know. I don't know

1219
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:50,760
Let's let's hope we never find out don't I don't think so

1220
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:55,600
I just don't think he was that kind of guy probably not but you know, what is a real Sudoku guy?

1221
01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:00,800
He wasn't really a hangout Joe is basically saying that his goal was to launder Alex

1222
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:05,200
To his audience by virtue of seeing how how much fun we can hang out with

1223
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:12,520
Furthermore. Hey, fuck you. How about fuck you you would have fun if you were in a room with me and Alex Jones and Eddie Bravo

1224
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:16,960
What if you were a fucking Muslim woman not much not much fun

1225
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,960
No to have the guy across from you who is saying shit like I want you to die

1226
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:26,040
Yeah a trans person. What if you were not a white guy? Yeah, huh? Well Eddie's a

1227
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:31,540
Person of color. Okay. Anyway, look, here's what I would say Eddie's Eddie

1228
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:33,940
Here's what I would say

1229
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:37,060
If this was your goal

1230
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:43,540
Then you have a responsibility to not allow Alex to talk about anything conspiracy related anything political on your show

1231
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:50,140
Yep, if your goal was just to talk about how fun Alex is you guys have an interview and a talk?

1232
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:55,460
We get drunk and talk about college football and high school and like talk about that stuff

1233
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:57,660
Yeah, you do not talk about the globalists

1234
01:32:57,660 --> 01:33:04,420
You don't talk about his bullshit because then that intersects with where his misinformation is and you especially don't turn it into a call back

1235
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:10,260
No, you can always go back to and say hey look we had him on our show and he checked out

1236
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:15,060
Mm-hmm. So if you if you think something's wrong, I'll tell you he checked out when I looked at you

1237
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:18,660
It's a perfect case of wanting to play both games at the same time

1238
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:24,020
yeah, it's like I wanted to show the world that you were fun by getting fucked up with you and

1239
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:27,100
and tacitly supporting your conspiracies

1240
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:28,580
like that's not that's not

1241
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:33,180
You can't pretend that you're fact-checking him and showing that he's fun because you're doing neither

1242
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:38,780
It's almost as though he grew up kind of choosing the path of least resistance

1243
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:44,060
You know to just kind of get along with everybody around him and just kind of not make

1244
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:48,020
Your identity that could be how you form your identity damn

1245
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:54,020
So I will say that Joe is not comfortable with how much Alex wants to talk about how famous he is

1246
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:56,180
What is it like to be?

1247
01:33:56,180 --> 01:34:01,560
You know the the main Oracle because you can say like, you know, Jimmy Carson was this guy

1248
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:04,800
I mean older Cronkite was that guy you're kind of that fuse together on a first

1249
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:08,180
You have the audience are bigger when every other media has been atomized

1250
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:11,900
But in force is a close second or whatever, but this matters not about that

1251
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:16,460
You're in the position of being the Oracle does that like an Oracle Adelphi right now?

1252
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:24,100
Well, you're definitely not helping me with your weird description of what I do cuz it's not accurate nor is it respectful

1253
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:30,460
It's ridiculous. He's a little bit more playful when he's saying it's it sounded like he was actually saying that's disrespect

1254
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:38,100
But he is uncomfortable and he should be that's fucking weird

1255
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:42,260
yeah, I would not be comfortable with that Joe interviews people and has

1256
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:46,340
In formal conversations that go too long and yeah

1257
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:50,500
You're the Oracle of Delphi. Yeah, you're basically Walter Cronkite and

1258
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:53,060
Jimmy Carson Oh

1259
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:57,060
Jimmy Carson. Oh, man. He had some of those great jokes

1260
01:34:57,060 --> 01:35:02,580
He used to wear a where a turban Joe Rogan actually was on Jimmy Carson. He got waved over to the love seat

1261
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:08,300
Made his career overnight success

1262
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:11,180
Oh, we got in at the store. Yeah

1263
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:16,020
Oh

1264
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:17,620
Jimmy Carson

1265
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:22,740
So one of the things that I think was a big point that I made early on in our podcast

1266
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:28,540
And I maybe make it less now because I don't like him nearly as much as I used to yeah

1267
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:32,580
Not to say that I used to like Alex, but I certainly dislike him more. Yes. Yes

1268
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:39,860
I actively dislike him a lot more. Yeah, but one thing that I still do believe but I think is probably less important

1269
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:45,220
Is that the role that he used to fill is kind of a good role in society?

1270
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:53,820
The kind of guy who will freak you out and maybe it's your brother's friend or something who tells you about the CIA

1271
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:59,700
Or whatever sure. Sure. Sure. That is a voice that there is a place for in society

1272
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:06,140
Mm-hmm a conspiracy theorist who you know doesn't behave the way that Alex does the guy who's not also

1273
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:13,180
Who can't hurt anybody a complete racist bigot monster and semi throwing around demon shit all the time

1274
01:36:13,420 --> 01:36:18,220
You know somebody without malice. Yeah. Yeah, there is a place for that

1275
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:22,740
Yeah, and I think Joe like he touches on like why?

1276
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:28,780
Alex has anything and it's because there was a place that he fit in before

1277
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:35,460
You've taught me a lot of things and this is very important. Like like I said earlier on the show about

1278
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:38,580
people using

1279
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:40,780
other

1280
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:43,180
Departments or other

1281
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:46,660
law enforcement or whatever to start smashing

1282
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:53,100
Polite protests and turning them into violent protests like until you showed me all that stuff about agent provocateurs

1283
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:58,340
I really had no idea that anybody would ever think like that. I had this naive perspective

1284
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:03,780
I think a lot of people have that people that are in government and people that are in

1285
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:09,180
Leadership they really just want the best for the citizens

1286
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:13,260
So there is there is a role that can be filled of like

1287
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:16,220
Discussing these kinds of topics. They often aren't

1288
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:21,540
necessarily front and center sure there there's a value to that

1289
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:27,460
Yeah, but unfortunately the double-edge of this clip is it so clearly demonstrates

1290
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:30,100
Why what Alex is doing nowadays is useless. Yeah

1291
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:36,780
Like yes in the 90s Alex woke you up to the idea of agent provocateurs, right?

1292
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:40,820
That is his niche, right? That's what he should be right? He

1293
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:47,020
Strayed too far and ended up being a guy who can shift into psychic spaces

1294
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:51,940
And his lore is a little too complicated now his skill set is absurd

1295
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:56,300
Yeah, he's a show that went on too long. He's ending the way Game of Thrones did

1296
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:59,860
I think he's a victim of his own success. Yeah, right like he

1297
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:06,700
Whatever the reason he got like millions of dollars and ended up in that flashy ass studio

1298
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:11,340
Mm-hmm. It's the detriment of his career. Like he could probably have lived out a pretty

1299
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:13,500
successful

1300
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:18,340
Making a good living being a conspiracy theory talk-show host

1301
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:23,340
But he got too big for his britches and now this is embarrassing. No comedians are funnier when they're on the bus

1302
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:27,060
I never I've never dreamt of being like famous

1303
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:32,700
I've always just wanted to be a comic who lived his life as like a comic like I want to live comic life

1304
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:34,700
I don't want to make a comic show

1305
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:39,940
I want to live comic life. I don't want millions. I don't I definitely don't want a hundred million enough. Yeah

1306
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:43,020
Yeah, having too much might end up being

1307
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:46,540
It might make you unable to do

1308
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:47,960
Whatever it is

1309
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:53,700
You need to do because once you start going down this road and you start worrying about like pill sales

1310
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:58,540
And all this you start to think about like what are the things that I'm doing that gets the most attention?

1311
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:05,560
For sure and then you know, it's no longer. Hey, here's a boring conversation about the reality of

1312
01:39:06,020 --> 01:39:11,020
Agent provocateurs and what you need to know about the history of this tactic, right?

1313
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:15,140
It now becomes everybody is pretending that they have relatives who have died

1314
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:19,200
Yeah, because it's exciting because it excites the internet and it gets a traffic

1315
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:26,540
Yeah, because your incentive is no longer to educate or whatever if that was his attention at the beginning

1316
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:32,500
I guess it's it's now a marketing base. Yeah, that's I mean, it's it's you know

1317
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:39,740
the idea of not trying to be a millionaire and doing every single possible step you can take to get there is a

1318
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:47,400
Radical socialist commie bullshit Dan and you're on my list fair enough. So whereas Alex

1319
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:53,340
30 years ago turned Joe on to agent provocateurs

1320
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:58,540
This is what he does now. I'm in Arizona three weeks ago. I got a call from the White House

1321
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:03,900
High level high level. Well, I mean, you know a Trump son

1322
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:09,380
Secret, I'll just say it's all about name dropping too late. Oh you need to look into

1323
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:14,940
Dominion and communist China and Switzerland all the stuff

1324
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:19,620
We'll call this guy. This guy calls me up from like this big company

1325
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:24,300
He tells me all this stuff. And so I hire a company look at it. We get all the SEC documents

1326
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:26,260
They're on him forwards all the news today

1327
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:28,740
And but this is I asked him I said

1328
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:32,800
Why are you telling me this and they all we've chosen you as the conduit?

1329
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:36,820
I'm almost like is that to discredit it because they've said I'm just right

1330
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:42,780
That's the thing like they can do that with someone so he that's full of shit that he just took that from

1331
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:46,360
Q and on yeah Twitter accounts and stuff. That was just a

1332
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:53,940
The conspiracy that he he laundered but it's interesting there at the end when he's talking about like are they doing this to discredit me?

1333
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:59,900
Yeah, that moment of self-reflection was very strange. Why would Trump's son do that?

1334
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:03,060
You forgot that you said that he was your source. Yeah

1335
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:08,420
It does make sense if you think that they're trying to discredit

1336
01:41:08,660 --> 01:41:14,620
He's just lying and telling these intriguing stories to Joe to keep his attention. Yeah, and he just keeps lying

1337
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:17,300
What are the what's the percentage of people that vote?

1338
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:24,660
Usually it's about 60% in a national election about 49% in an off-year election up down to 40

1339
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:31,100
But with the whole metric with Trump they had a overturn of about 90% Democrat how many percent Republican turn on?

1340
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:34,100
Yeah, how many what they had 9% Democrat turn 90?

1341
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:40,580
Never has been statistically fake. It's never happened. It's a 90% fraud proof though. They just used all Democrat voters, right?

1342
01:41:40,580 --> 01:41:42,580
But do you know that for a fact?

1343
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:45,420
Yes, they had like 87% of Democrats audio

1344
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:50,140
In the 2020 election there was a 66.7% voter turnout

1345
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:56,640
Alex is just making shit up and saying it confidently which allows him to lie to Joe's face and not get called on it

1346
01:41:56,860 --> 01:42:02,400
Because Joe is attached to the messenger and Alex knows that he's exploiting it

1347
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:08,100
Yeah, but the end goal is attention. The end goal is attention

1348
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:14,500
He lies to Joe in order to disseminate this information and because Joe doesn't have the wherewithal to push back on it

1349
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:17,060
Be like fuck yourself. There's no way there was a 90%

1350
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:20,380
Democrat turnout what the fuck are you talking about?

1351
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:24,500
Because he doesn't have that or maybe he doesn't want to cause conflict or whatever

1352
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:29,220
Whatever reason these talking points end up being laundered to Joe's audience

1353
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:36,300
Yep, if people look up to Joe and they respect him he's sitting there and he's allowing this point to stand tacit endorsement

1354
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:41,540
Yeah, exactly. But again, the goal is attention and you can see that very clearly

1355
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:43,740
in this clip

1356
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:49,340
Imagine being like the hot chick back in like 1963 the cum dump

1357
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:56,620
Well, let's look at it in a respectful way Alex the hot chick Christ back in 62

1358
01:42:57,340 --> 01:43:04,660
When there wasn't that many of them, you know, there wasn't no Instagram models Marilyn cum dump or uh, how dare you?

1359
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:06,660
You keep saying that

1360
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:14,700
The main goal there is let me on what's that? This is like the mean goal is beyond the mean gold, okay

1361
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:17,980
Well, that's the cringiest shit

1362
01:43:17,980 --> 01:43:24,740
I've ever heard just he's so tickled by the idea that him saying cum dump is gonna be mean gold

1363
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:31,900
Well, oh they're gonna be this so I can't think of it. I don't want you to play this on our show

1364
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:35,100
It's really discussed. It's disgusting. Yeah. Oh

1365
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:41,880
There's two different kinds of disgusting. There's the obvious disgusting. Oh, yeah, and then there's the disgusting of like

1366
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:43,900
how

1367
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:47,980
Transparently pathetic is this like how badly you want someone to make a meme?

1368
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:53,860
Yeah out of you so much to make a meme of all the times. He's desperately begging to have memes made. Okay

1369
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:56,420
Yeah, like cuz that's the reality of this

1370
01:43:56,420 --> 01:44:03,780
It's it's everything that he's saying that's like kind of gross and offensive is then tagged with I'm trying to get the memes going

1371
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:05,780
Yeah, so sad

1372
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:11,500
Also sad Alex makes a claim about something that Bill Gates said on Japanese TV

1373
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:15,740
Mm-hmm, and because they're doing this and then putting it out later

1374
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:18,660
Alex is able to drop in proof

1375
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:22,660
Okay of his claim. All right, which they do about four or five times

1376
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:27,340
None of it proves anything, but this is the most egregious example. Okay, this is

1377
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:33,460
Outrageous and Joe if you're listening, which I know you're not I would I would say listen to this

1378
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:37,820
Listen to the proof that Alex tagged on he had all the time in the world to find

1379
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:42,860
Edit it later. This is it back in this is what he chose. This is your guy

1380
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:47,940
No, he's Bill Gates said. Oh, don't worry. The Japanese TV goes this is gonna kill people

1381
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:50,700
He goes it's for the he goes it's for other countries now, you know

1382
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:55,820
The printer goes on why I don't know if exactly what you said is representative

1383
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:59,820
Yeah, how many times have I told you a

1384
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:02,020
lot

1385
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:05,620
But when you go down crazy town was on Japanese, you know, I don't have a map

1386
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:12,460
He said it more more defended. He goes. Yes, don't Japanese even they go, you know vaccine cause damage

1387
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:16,500
Oh people are like you about he's this man. You claim you want to be popular he goes

1388
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:23,820
Japan China the United States are not the target. We have special vaccines for other countries. He goes. Oh, yes

1389
01:45:23,820 --> 01:45:25,820
Oh, I mean it was like

1390
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:31,820
He said the deal. Yeah, do I see that? Can you show me that on this? I gotta pee again

1391
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:34,520
I don't think of this. I'll find it. We'll do it right now

1392
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:42,860
I'd say it's an ironic if you take somebody who's doing their best to get the world ready and you know putting in my case

1393
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:49,780
millions of dollars into these tools for infectious diseases and really trying to solve

1394
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:56,180
Broadly infectious diseases including those that can cause pandemics, but that you know

1395
01:45:56,700 --> 01:46:03,820
We're in a crazy situation. So there's going to be crazy rumors. I hope whether it's individuals or

1396
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:11,380
Countries then some ways that shows us how interdependent we are that to stop a a global pandemic

1397
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:18,900
we need to find whoever's the best whatever the best vaccine construct are the best drugs and we need to make it

1398
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:23,060
Without just focusing on one country. We need to make it for the entire world

1399
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:30,840
Including for countries that don't have the resources to pay for vaccine research or vaccine factories

1400
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:33,020
You know, they're actually

1401
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:38,700
Many ways should be the priority for what we do. That's the whole clip that Alex plays

1402
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:45,780
He played that clip to prove that Bill Gates went on Japanese TV and said Japan China US you guys get a different vaccine

1403
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:51,000
I really feel like that proved the opposite of what he was saying. It certainly didn't prove anything. It didn't prove anything

1404
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:51,540
No

1405
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:57,580
it kind of proved that Bill didn't say that it kind of proves that Alex makes shit up or he has such a

1406
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:04,220
Flimsy grasp on reality that he hears that clip and that's what he thinks Bill Gates is saying

1407
01:47:04,220 --> 01:47:07,100
He has to believe that that's like he's so smart

1408
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:11,980
He's reading him between the lines. I would assume that that's the most generous thing that makes sense

1409
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:17,260
Yes, because that literally says everyone should get the vaccine and we should focus on countries who can't make it for themselves

1410
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:22,660
Yeah, they should be a priority. Yeah, because it is also a global issue as opposed to yeah

1411
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:26,660
one country's problem to solve yeah, I don't like I

1412
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:32,480
Like to say I don't get it. I don't understand but like there are there are a limited number of

1413
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:38,240
Insertions. Yeah. Yeah. One is Alex is intentionally misleading. Mm-hmm

1414
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:45,560
The second is he is a consumer of bullshit news sites. Yeah, and he thinks he's never watched the clip

1415
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:49,240
He just has read a headline about it from National File or whatever

1416
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:55,920
And he thinks that's what it said or he watched it and that's what he interpreted it as and it's completely

1417
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:00,400
erroneous putting it in later, it's so it's so

1418
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:05,760
Sad. Confusing? It's not confusing. Why would you do that? You know, I don't know

1419
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,060
I mean

1420
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:07,200
I think that there are

1421
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:14,240
Some words that you can say that sound very similar sure and depending on what you think the word is is what you will hear

1422
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:21,440
That could be I think that Alex would probably assume that he's implanted the idea that that's what Bill Gates was saying

1423
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:24,640
Yeah, so if you hear that that's how if you think Alex knows shit

1424
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:29,360
That's all you'll be primed for the correct interpretation of his so that's what I assume

1425
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:31,360
he thinks it's almost like a

1426
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:33,760
fucking gaslighting

1427
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:40,400
Three-pointer, you know, it's like I'm going to tell you what you're about to hear doesn't say what you're about to hear

1428
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:47,160
Yeah, or you just think people just like not really pay attention. Yeah, that's probably like oh, there's he played a clip of Bill Gates

1429
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:50,720
It must have said Rogan's in the bathroom. I'll skip this part

1430
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:58,040
Listen Rogan's fans are the meatheads and the potheads like, you know, you can trick him. That's fair. That is fair

1431
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:03,760
That is fair. So once again Joe takes issue with people who critique his podcast

1432
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:08,440
Interview with Alex strange and this one is also not a good point

1433
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:10,800
Well, there was a lot of people that got tricked

1434
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:16,480
They got tricked into thinking that the podcast was something other than what it was and they they read some

1435
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:23,880
Someone else's description and more people did that then listen cuz well, you know, we did three hours plus right?

1436
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:30,660
How many how many did you do 20 or something like that? I'm crazy. There's no way they listened

1437
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:37,960
There's someone they don't like for three hours and 20 minutes. Like why would they do that? Yeah, why would we do that?

1438
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:45,520
All right, Joe, that's a personal insult yeah that that one that is that hurts at all

1439
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:47,640
personal

1440
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:51,920
That is not abroad. These liberals are doing that's you specifically Dan

1441
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:53,520
Why

1442
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:55,960
What's most tragic about that is I don't have a good answer

1443
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,680
Why would people listen to hours of someone they hate

1444
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:04,880
Mmm, that's a good question

1445
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:08,120
That's a good question. Also, you just described my job

1446
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:14,220
Don't you dare say 20 hours like oh, look at how much work we did screw you

1447
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:17,640
We put more time in talking about you dudes talk

1448
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:24,480
Yeah, but I mean I I do understand that deflection of like it was really long people couldn't have possibly listened to it

1449
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:29,380
I thought it was shit. Sure and like no, I mean, I'm more primed to listen to something that I think is shit

1450
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:31,380
Yeah, that's something that is

1451
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:37,960
Bad like this was way more painful than Joe's episode totally and granted him. This is four hours

1452
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:39,240
I was three and a half or whatever

1453
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:42,840
But like Alex was hot dogging on Joe's show

1454
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:49,800
Which at least makes some kind of an entertainment value and Joe knows that this is his platform and he has to have some

1455
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:57,000
Semblance of a shrine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and so like those dynamics played out on Joe's show, which made it a little bit more of

1456
01:50:57,680 --> 01:51:01,320
Interesting. Yeah than this which is long stretches of

1457
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,400
Nothing. No, this is two dudes and Alex being like you're so famous

1458
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:09,700
This is a two person make a mean is it a two-person smoke circle?

1459
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:14,960
And that's the worst to possibly be in Alex's how it doesn't have the showmanship chops

1460
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:21,460
To carry this as like a show so being on Alex's turf is a problem

1461
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:26,720
Hmm Joe is not as good as like when he's a guest

1462
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:32,480
yeah, as he is when he's on his own show because he'll just talk about how he ate or drank some coffee that a

1463
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:39,320
Shit it out. Do you get it? Isn't that gross? But it's good. How can that be? Yeah

1464
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:45,460
Yeah, I I just hmm. I feel like this must have been an apology like I something

1465
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:47,460
I feel like this has to be a thing where

1466
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:50,720
Rogan said you can't come on my yeah. Yeah

1467
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:57,520
I'll go on your place. Yeah, but I won't be on your actual show. We'll just get drunk and record something

1468
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:02,320
Yeah, I feel like it has to be something like that some kind of olive branch. Yeah, I don't know

1469
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:07,200
It's a real bummer. There is no point for this to exist other than for them to try and get attention

1470
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:12,160
Yeah, it's absurd unlike wild mountain time which exists only for itself to sure

1471
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:19,760
So we have one last clip and it's Alex really summing things up well, and I think Joe nails it all right well

1472
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:23,680
I've been on there 27 years and Joe Rogan. I want to thank you for everything

1473
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:30,280
I want to say this is the best four hours. I ever spent. Thank you so much. That's what's outrageous outrageous about this world

1474
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:33,280
That's what's outrageous. What is it this could be your best show?

1475
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:40,000
This was nonsense. It is nonsense. Yeah, that's fair. Yeah. Yeah, I like ideas man

1476
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:47,440
I do I like ideas. That's why I like listening to things that I don't agree with I like listening to Alex Jones because I like

1477
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:52,700
Finding I first of all I mean he says stupid things like Alex with guns and shit great

1478
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:55,720
There are certain things that just wouldn't normally come up in

1479
01:52:56,300 --> 01:53:01,640
Conversations of people I enjoy and I find interesting sure podcast that I would listen to for pleasure

1480
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:08,520
Certainly a lot of those things wouldn't be overlapping with Alex, right? That's why I listen to stuff like project Camelot

1481
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,520
Hmm, I like ideas yeah

1482
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:17,740
Weirdest and weirdest ideas that you can possibly get let's fly in the face of danger and see if something might be true

1483
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:23,160
What if you what if one thing is true Dan just like Joe was saying yeah?

1484
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:27,160
Just because he's lied a million times doesn't mean you won't find that one grain of gold

1485
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:32,560
I didn't know about that civic coffee. Yeah, there we go. We did it outside of that. I don't think there was any ideas

1486
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:36,640
That were interesting that were presented on this show. I think it was a disaster. I think it was stupid

1487
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:38,360
I

1488
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:44,800
Just I I here's a thought that I have never been able to escape ever since I was like really really young

1489
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:51,800
It's helped me so far if like whenever I was like 10 years old I remember hearing

1490
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:53,880
All of my friends have this

1491
01:53:53,880 --> 01:54:01,080
Conversation and I remember being in the middle of it talking about it and I remember thinking there's no possible way that ten-year-olds in

1492
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:04,520
1990 blue are

1493
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:09,240
Having a new or interesting thought so if I am having a conversation

1494
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:15,340
Think for a second did somebody have this conversation several thousand years ago, and then maybe just read

1495
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:22,160
Maybe read instead of being like so here's what I think about the universe and what we should do is we should give everybody

1496
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:24,160
But you know like we got

1497
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:29,560
Tribalism and we got to do shrooms and like hey, maybe somebody's fucking thought about it before. Yeah

1498
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:34,200
Yeah, that is that is a perspective that it's important to have. Yeah, I do agree with you on that

1499
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:36,680
I think that exploring ideas

1500
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:41,360
Conversationally is a fun pastime and I think that that's what what a lot of spring

1501
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:43,880
Do in college sure

1502
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:49,240
And I think that it's what people do socially. I think it's a fun thing to do with friends totally

1503
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:51,240
I don't know if it's always

1504
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:57,960
Productive. I certainly know from listening to this that it's not entertaining. Yes. That's a good one. I don't know. I

1505
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:03,880
Come away with this. I tried to like really distill down like the points

1506
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:08,280
Mm-hmm that run through this because there are trends and all I could come up with are

1507
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:16,100
Left versus right tribalism sure nonsense. Yeah, that seems to be a thing that Joe really wants to talk about all about interpretation

1508
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:22,780
There's no possible way that the somebody could be correct. You got to overcome tribalism Joe really wants to point that out

1509
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:28,400
Alex wants to talk about how famous Joe is. Mm-hmm and how great it is that he's on Spotify

1510
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:36,360
And then Alex just is too overt and too obvious about his wanting to be a nation. Yeah, it's just it's it's tragic

1511
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:37,680
it's it's

1512
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:42,800
Like I keep saying it's cringe-worthy, but that's the only thing that's the only way I can describe it. Yeah, it's

1513
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:49,960
Exposing his is vulnerable underbelly of desperation. I mean, what's what's wild to me is

1514
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:53,260
Ostensibly, these are two professional

1515
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:55,800
broadcasters

1516
01:55:55,800 --> 01:56:01,880
How can you have this boring of a conversation when you've been doing this or some?

1517
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:07,960
facsimile of this job this very job that you are doing for 20 or 30 years and you come up with

1518
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:13,280
This and this is what you've got and one of the people is the Jimmy Carson of our time

1519
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:19,840
Jimmy Carson of our times man, you're wasting it. The other one's a close second. Yeah, you are no Ed McMahon, sir

1520
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:24,020
No, yeah, so there you go folks. You got it. Yeah, there it is

1521
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:27,680
You got stuff like everybody should do shrooms. Yep

1522
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:32,600
I think I might have also only decided to do this episode because I came up with the title for it long in advance

1523
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:35,360
And I was fourth try not a charm nice

1524
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:37,160
I

1525
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:38,240
Stuck

1526
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:44,720
But we'll be back on Monday with a discussion of whether or not Alex moved to DC and is living in a tenement camp

1527
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:46,360
Let's hope he is

1528
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:50,720
Who fingers crossed? Yeah, that'll be good news. We'll be back then but tell them Jordan we have a website

1529
