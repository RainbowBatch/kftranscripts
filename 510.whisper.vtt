saying we are the bad guys

00:59.360 --> 01:01.280
Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan

01:01.280 --> 01:01.680
I'm Jordan

01:01.680 --> 01:05.520
We're a couple dudes, I'd like to sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:05.520 --> 01:06.720
Oh indeed we are, Dan

01:06.720 --> 01:07.120
Jordan

01:07.120 --> 01:07.520
Dan

01:07.520 --> 01:08.000
Throw it in

01:08.000 --> 01:08.960
I have a quick question for you

01:08.960 --> 01:09.200
Sure

01:09.200 --> 01:10.240
What's your bright spot today?

01:10.240 --> 01:12.320
My bright spot today is a follow-up to our

01:12.320 --> 01:12.800
Follow-up?

01:12.800 --> 01:15.520
Yes, to our bonus episode that we put out on Wednesday

01:15.520 --> 01:16.400
Indeed we did

01:16.400 --> 01:20.000
People can find that over on patreon.com slash knowledgefight

01:20.000 --> 01:20.880
You can just look at it

01:20.880 --> 01:25.360
Sure, you don't have to be a subscriber or anything, it's free, it's public, but it's posted there

01:25.360 --> 01:31.120
on that page and we had played a delightful game of Thomas Jefferson or not Thomas Jefferson quotes

01:31.120 --> 01:31.600
Indeed

01:31.600 --> 01:37.040
Um, and my bright spot is following up on some things from the Zeep mailbox

01:37.040 --> 01:37.360
Okay

01:37.920 --> 01:42.960
So Nick sent some chocolate and some of these little nanoblocks

01:42.960 --> 01:44.960
Ah yes, yes, yeah

01:44.960 --> 01:50.080
I have to say first of all that nanoblocks are the coolest, greatest thing

01:50.080 --> 01:58.800
They are like little tiny Legos and I found building this pelican to be incredibly like a zen state

01:58.800 --> 02:03.360
I just felt really good, I was relaxed building this because you do have to focus

02:03.360 --> 02:04.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah

02:04.400 --> 02:06.080
Put the piece in the right place

02:06.080 --> 02:11.360
It was great, it was like a really, it really triggered a lot of those feelings that I had

02:11.360 --> 02:14.960
that I loved about Legos and I appreciate that gift

02:14.960 --> 02:17.120
And then also a follow-up on that chocolate

02:17.680 --> 02:19.120
The fizzy jelly

02:19.120 --> 02:21.280
Did you save any for me?

02:21.280 --> 02:21.680
No

02:21.680 --> 02:25.760
I did not think so and it was brutal because the moment you told me you liked it I was like

02:25.760 --> 02:28.640
I would like to try it and I know I'm never going to get the chance

02:28.640 --> 02:30.880
I will order a bar just so you can try it

02:30.880 --> 02:31.840
Just so I can try it

02:31.840 --> 02:32.960
It was so good

02:34.400 --> 02:35.120
How was it good?

02:35.760 --> 02:36.560
How was it good?

02:36.560 --> 02:37.440
It was balanced

02:37.440 --> 02:39.440
Was it gummy and chewy?

02:39.440 --> 02:44.080
There were little bits of gummy but not like offensively so

02:44.080 --> 02:44.560
Okay

02:44.560 --> 02:48.080
Like it wasn't like there was a like gum in the middle of something

02:48.080 --> 02:48.640
Okay, alright

02:48.640 --> 02:52.160
And then there was like a fizziness, like pop rocks kind of thing

02:52.160 --> 02:52.480
Really?

02:52.480 --> 02:54.960
But it wasn't over the top fizzy

02:54.960 --> 02:55.520
Okay

02:55.520 --> 02:57.360
It was a nonsense game

02:57.360 --> 02:58.240
Alright, okay

02:59.360 --> 03:02.080
On paper it doesn't work but it was so good

03:02.080 --> 03:04.800
This is one of those things where you're gonna have another one and you're gonna be like

03:04.800 --> 03:08.640
You know what, I realize all I liked was the fact that these things don't happen to me before

03:08.640 --> 03:10.320
and now that I've tried them again they're awful

03:10.880 --> 03:17.360
There's a chance but as it stands now I ate the fucking shit out of that bar

03:17.360 --> 03:18.560
I want to try it

03:18.560 --> 03:20.640
I want to try it, you could have saved me a piece

03:20.640 --> 03:21.040
Nope

03:21.040 --> 03:21.440
Nope

03:21.440 --> 03:21.680
Nope

03:22.560 --> 03:23.440
So what's your bright spot?

03:24.800 --> 03:27.840
Well my bright spot was going to be the piece of chocolate I was about to eat

03:27.840 --> 03:28.400
Wow

03:28.400 --> 03:29.040
Not gonna happen

03:29.680 --> 03:29.920
No

03:29.920 --> 03:30.880
You know who has it?

03:30.880 --> 03:32.880
John Grand Prix has that chocolate

03:32.880 --> 03:33.520
How's he doing?

03:33.520 --> 03:33.920
Not good

03:36.400 --> 03:41.280
My bright spot is a movie called Wild Mountain Time, I think is what it's called

03:42.240 --> 03:45.520
And it is an inexplicable movie

03:45.520 --> 03:46.800
I love it

03:46.800 --> 03:49.440
You know those movies- The fizzy jelly candy of movies

03:49.440 --> 03:50.480
A little bit, yeah

03:50.480 --> 03:53.600
You know those movies where you're like this is not a good movie

03:53.600 --> 03:55.200
This is not a bad movie

03:55.200 --> 03:58.640
This movie just needed to exist where it didn't before

03:58.640 --> 04:01.920
Like it's just a thing that you're like I'm glad that's there now

04:01.920 --> 04:03.120
It wasn't

04:03.120 --> 04:04.640
And it's my favorite type of story

04:04.640 --> 04:06.960
I don't know exactly what you're talking about

04:06.960 --> 04:09.040
It's my favorite type of story for two reasons

04:09.040 --> 04:16.000
One, it opens up with Christopher Walken doing voiceover in a terrible Irish accent

04:16.000 --> 04:20.800
That sounds like somebody doing an impression of Christopher Walken trying to do an Irish accent

04:20.800 --> 04:21.120
Okay

04:21.120 --> 04:21.840
It's fantastic

04:22.560 --> 04:24.720
And you're like oh this is probably gonna stop

04:24.720 --> 04:25.360
Nope

04:25.360 --> 04:25.840
Keeps going

04:25.840 --> 04:26.400
Keeps going

04:26.400 --> 04:26.880
Oh yeah

04:26.880 --> 04:28.720
This leads me to believe that it is a bad movie

04:28.720 --> 04:29.840
No it's amazing

04:29.840 --> 04:30.400
It's amazing

04:30.400 --> 04:33.440
And it's also my favorite type of Irish story of which there are only two

04:33.440 --> 04:35.360
There are two Irish stories in the world, Dan

04:35.360 --> 04:37.040
There's Irish stories that go like this

04:38.000 --> 04:40.080
Oh my god you're an outsider get the fuck away

04:40.080 --> 04:43.040
And then over time they're like okay fine you can stay

04:43.040 --> 04:46.080
But you know too much so you can never leave

04:46.080 --> 04:48.800
Or the other kind where it's like ah get the fuck away from here

04:48.800 --> 04:49.760
And then they leave

04:49.760 --> 04:50.960
Like those are the only two types

04:50.960 --> 04:54.320
If there's no story where the Irish people grow and change

04:54.320 --> 04:56.800
Nuh-uh you're either in or out and that's it

04:56.800 --> 04:57.200
Okay

04:57.200 --> 04:59.120
And this is very much one of those stories

04:59.120 --> 05:02.320
And then like the way it could be sold to you

05:02.320 --> 05:05.440
The way that people are going to review it is there's like a twist at the end

05:05.440 --> 05:06.960
There is not a twist

05:06.960 --> 05:08.240
It's not a twist

05:08.240 --> 05:11.600
It's just a reason and it's going to blow your fucking mind

05:11.600 --> 05:13.600
Okay I'm not gonna watch this movie but

05:13.600 --> 05:14.400
You gotta see it

05:14.400 --> 05:16.000
Okay fine I'll watch it

05:16.000 --> 05:17.840
Just because I want people to talk about it

05:17.840 --> 05:19.280
I want more people to talk about it

05:19.280 --> 05:20.480
I want to talk about this movie

05:20.480 --> 05:22.880
You're gonna get some messages now from people who want to discuss

05:22.880 --> 05:24.000
I can't wait

05:24.000 --> 05:25.520
Rocky Mountain Fever whatever it's called

05:25.520 --> 05:27.440
It's an insane movie I can't wait

05:27.440 --> 05:27.840
All right

05:28.880 --> 05:31.280
Jordan today we have an interesting episode to go over

05:31.280 --> 05:36.480
My path was winding and rocky as I got to this episode

05:36.480 --> 05:38.720
But I think we're gonna have some fun

05:38.720 --> 05:42.240
And before we get into the episode itself let's take a little moment to say thank you

05:42.240 --> 05:43.920
To some folks who've signed up and are supporting the show

05:43.920 --> 05:44.880

06:27.420 --> 06:33.580
That's like that's Jimmy Carter's brother in the way. It's Vincent Van Gogh's brother like that kind of yeah makes sense

06:33.580 --> 06:35.860
Yeah, if you're out there listening and thinking hey

06:35.860 --> 06:38.740
I enjoy the show. I'd like to support these gents too. You can do that by going to our website

06:38.740 --> 06:43.340
knowledgefight.com clicking the button says support the show or what you could do is you could take that

06:43.660 --> 06:48.780
Generosity and you could just funnel it into some sort of creative spirit and it doesn't matter what it's about

06:48.900 --> 06:54.020
It doesn't matter what it's about or whether or not it's good what it's about is getting it out there

06:54.020 --> 06:57.940
So even if you're confused by your generous spirit put it out there

06:57.940 --> 07:03.700
Take it to a local bail funder charity and I'll be goddamn if it's not better said in Ireland. So there you go

07:03.700 --> 07:05.700
There you go

07:05.740 --> 07:10.740
Landed it. Yeah. Thank you. So Jordan this episode today. We're gonna start

07:11.380 --> 07:14.860
Where where I'm sort of going down this road

07:15.820 --> 07:20.520
Starting with a little bit from Wednesday December 9th. Okay on Alex's show

07:21.460 --> 07:24.820
He's he's in a weird headspace can just bragging

07:25.420 --> 07:29.620
There's about a half hour at the beginning about a half hour bragging about half hour of him

07:29.620 --> 07:32.500
Just talking about how he's like so popular

07:32.500 --> 07:35.540
Everybody loves all right. I mean look

07:36.180 --> 07:41.440
We've been taking off almost every box system that plugs into the internet and quote gives you cable

07:41.440 --> 07:45.160
But cloud TV is owned by Patriots. They put us on two years ago

07:45.300 --> 07:48.120
We're number one on cloud TV

07:48.120 --> 07:54.740
And if you combine all news channels together including OAN or bigger than all of them Newsmax OAN all of them together

07:55.380 --> 07:57.560
And again, they're kind of shocked by that

07:57.560 --> 08:00.540
They even moved us used to we were at the top is whatever was number one

08:00.540 --> 08:02.740
They put at the top they kind of move us the bottom like well

08:02.740 --> 08:04.700
He just he just dominates too much

08:04.700 --> 08:08.100
We kind of that sounds like like a good reason channels will get some more viewers

08:08.100 --> 08:12.800
And I'm not in competition with those folks. I love OAN. I really like Newsmax

08:14.060 --> 08:20.580
It's just that they won't play just funny because we have more viewers than all of them combined on cloud TV

08:20.860 --> 08:24.480
Obviously OAN is on a much more cable systems and satellite systems, and I love it

08:24.480 --> 08:29.980
And I hope OAN or Newsmax become the number one stations. I don't care. We're too popular. We're just so popular

08:29.980 --> 08:30.780
We're too popular

08:30.780 --> 08:33.060
They used to put us up at the top because we were so popular

08:33.060 --> 08:38.460
But now they put us at the bottom so other channels have a chance. That really doesn't sound right that doesn't sound like good business logic

08:38.460 --> 08:45.500
This goes on for so fucking long. I was getting so annoyed and then Alex was like not only am I the most popular thing

08:45.500 --> 08:47.500
I'm also like super alpha

08:48.020 --> 08:50.580
See, I'm an alpha male so when I was a kid I

08:52.020 --> 08:56.500
Had the alpha genes I guess and I'd see a super like like Jason Jinko jeans

08:56.500 --> 09:00.780
513 where guys coming in with a knife, and you don't fight back and you run you fall down and you plead

09:00.780 --> 09:07.500
I thought that was fake. I've grown up now actually the average man or woman does fall down and starts groveling and

09:09.340 --> 09:14.460
But now actually if Jason pulled a knife out the average liberal would run up and grab it and go I love you

09:14.460 --> 09:19.340
I love you. This is good for me isn't in horror movies isn't the thing that people trip isn't that?

09:20.660 --> 09:25.140
Yeah, no white women in a scary situation in a horror movie are going to fall

09:25.140 --> 09:27.140
But even dudes too like you trip over your feet

09:27.700 --> 09:32.060
It's the trope that sure yeah, I don't think that the people

09:32.060 --> 09:38.100
I don't know. Maybe there are some horror movies where people intentionally fall down and then beg off with Jason

09:38.100 --> 09:43.460
But I think it's mostly like they're trying to get away and then something happens. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know

09:43.460 --> 09:45.940
I think we're doing their best. They weren't like oh shit

09:47.220 --> 09:54.060
Maybe this monster will have mercy. Oh what I should have tried was groveling. Yeah, I don't know anyway

09:54.060 --> 09:58.540
I just got so damn tired of this. Yeah. I was just like I need why?

10:04.100 --> 10:10.160
I just needed something anything to go on and there was one talking point that was going on on Wednesday's show

10:10.580 --> 10:16.740
Like I was trying to find like this something to pull out. Yeah. Yeah, this is this is something that is worth discussing

10:17.260 --> 10:19.260
We've got a lot more here to cover but

10:19.260 --> 10:26.660
FDA six people died during Pfizer COVID vaccine trial so we're gonna be talking about something else as a whole on today's episode

10:26.780 --> 10:29.180
But I did want to bring this up

10:29.180 --> 10:30.260
I think it's a

10:30.260 --> 10:36.540
Important for us to cover this and probably the sooner the better because that feels like it's gonna become a big talking point

10:36.540 --> 10:38.540
Yeah on his show this week

10:38.720 --> 10:43.820
Alex has been repeating this particular headline with outrageous repetition over at infowars

10:43.820 --> 10:48.740
You can find the headline quote FDA six people died during Pfizer COVID vaccine trial

10:48.740 --> 10:51.740
The actual article covers some of the details of this story

10:51.740 --> 10:57.460
But these details you don't really hear them when Alex covers it on the show because he just reads headlines then rants about what he?

10:57.460 --> 11:01.820
Wants the story to be about it sounds scary that six people died in these trials

11:01.820 --> 11:06.660
But in cases like this, it's crucially important to consult the actual information to see what the data says

11:07.140 --> 11:09.100
If you go to the FDA's website

11:09.100 --> 11:14.960
You can find the vaccines and related biological products advisory committee briefing document on the new Pfizer

11:14.960 --> 11:18.280
vaccine if you read this document

11:18.280 --> 11:24.000
You'll find that six participants in the trial are dead, but that number has to be understood in context

11:24.220 --> 11:29.680
The first thing to consider is that there were forty three thousand two hundred fifty two participants enrolled in the study

11:29.960 --> 11:32.120
Six out of that is a very low number

11:32.120 --> 11:38.520
But even so if the vaccine killed six out of forty three thousand people that still might be a cause for concern

11:38.520 --> 11:42.920
Well, I mean if there's three hundred and three thirty million people getting the vaccine, right?

11:42.920 --> 11:46.520
Yes scale up and that could be a huge number it would you know?

11:46.520 --> 11:49.360
So that's why you kind of need to look a little bit further in the text

11:49.360 --> 11:54.040
If you do you'll find that four out of the six deaths were people who were in the placebo group

11:54.040 --> 11:57.280
Which is to say that they didn't even get the vaccine that's being tested

11:57.480 --> 12:01.600
These deaths are absolutely unrelated to the vaccine because they didn't get the vaccine

12:01.720 --> 12:07.680
So that leaves us with two people in the experimental group who died one of whom was retroactively John F

12:07.680 --> 12:10.000
Kennedy so we know why he went down his corpse

12:10.000 --> 12:15.320
It didn't get COVID so these two individuals were both in the older group

12:15.320 --> 12:22.920
Which means that they were over 55 years of age one experienced quote cardiac arrests 60 days after dose two and died

12:22.920 --> 12:28.080
Three days later. This was a person who was in the trial, but two months afterwards had a heart attack

12:28.280 --> 12:32.080
This is sad for that person, but almost certainly unrelated to the vaccine

12:32.360 --> 12:37.720
The other person experienced quote arteriosclerosis and died three days after dose one

12:37.720 --> 12:40.760
Arteriosclerosis is a gradual condition

12:40.760 --> 12:45.720
And it's kind of absurd to imagine that it developed in three days because of a vaccine in this case

12:45.720 --> 12:50.680
It seems almost certain that there was an underlying condition unrelated to the vaccine that precipitated the death

12:50.680 --> 12:55.300
I thought it might be possible that you can make a study out of whether or not the vaccine could have

12:55.680 --> 13:01.520
Exacerbated an existing arteriosclerosis, but that doesn't seem like it was a major concern of the authors doesn't seem like it was likely

13:01.880 --> 13:07.080
So there were two deaths in the experimental group, but both are unlikely connected to the vaccine itself

13:07.080 --> 13:13.400
But that report is being misrepresented and reported by people like Alex to be that six people died in the trial and you're gonna die

13:13.400 --> 13:22.040
too I just it it seems like a very obvious oversight for any news organization not to at least be like

13:22.680 --> 13:27.320
Six people died in the trial only to receive the vaccine in the headline

13:27.320 --> 13:32.760
I'm not I'm not positive how any other outlet reported it so I can't speak to that. I do agree with you

13:32.760 --> 13:37.240
Yeah, that seems that you gotta do that. It's an important detail. Yeah, you can't not do that

13:37.240 --> 13:39.240
Four in the placebo group is very important

13:39.240 --> 13:44.360
Yeah, when you're looking at that number if two-thirds of the number you're talking about exactly is in the placebo group

13:44.520 --> 13:49.560
But I only know what how it was reported on info wars and of course their standard is lying

13:49.560 --> 13:51.640
Yeah, a little bit of a different situation

13:51.640 --> 13:59.600
yeah, the paper itself from the FDA explicitly lays this out quote the incidents of severe adverse events and deaths were low in the

13:59.600 --> 14:01.760
context of the number of participants enrolled and

14:01.760 --> 14:05.280
And comparable for experimental and placebo. Yeah, so

14:06.320 --> 14:08.600
This is a disgusting lie on Alex's part

14:08.600 --> 14:14.000
Which he's able to pass off by neglecting to inform his audience of what the headline he's reading actually means

14:14.200 --> 14:20.080
He gives the audience the illusion that he's informing them of important stuff when he reports that six people died in the vaccine trial

14:20.080 --> 14:27.560
But what he's actually doing is misinforming the flashy clickbait style headline is not necessarily untrue itself

14:27.560 --> 14:32.280
But the conclusion that's meant to lead you to is a lie and a misrepresentation effects

14:32.520 --> 14:40.280
So I got this and I just was like I'm not feeling it. Yeah got one thing. That's like, okay, that's important

14:40.280 --> 14:46.920
Yeah, and it'll probably be something you hear about moving forward as more countries roll out of that

14:47.800 --> 14:50.800
But I was like, I don't want to I don't want to I don't care

14:50.800 --> 14:53.480
I don't want to listen to half an hour of Alex

14:53.480 --> 14:58.240
Rambling about how great he is and then I started to think about it this weekend

14:58.520 --> 15:02.600
Alex is supposed to go down to DC. Yeah, I'm supposed to go move to DC

15:02.600 --> 15:07.160
Sure, and that means I got to write a song about yeah, that is true. That is true. You've got some work to do

15:07.160 --> 15:12.080
Uh-huh. So I felt like my follow-ups don't equal the original Monday

15:12.160 --> 15:16.720
We've got to get into like Alex going to DC and all that stuff

15:16.720 --> 15:21.800
Yeah, have a little better idea of what happened with that protest. We have a responsibility, right?

15:21.800 --> 15:25.680
so I was thinking we have a responsibility to do other things and

15:27.000 --> 15:32.720
Maybe now is the best time. Oh, we're not gonna do Rogan are we but you take DMT with Joe Biden

15:37.880 --> 15:39.880
Shit so we're gonna cover the

15:41.080 --> 15:47.400
Last week, I think maybe I just recently Joe Rogan showed up in Alex's studio in Austin

15:47.400 --> 15:52.720
And they did a four-hour interview, which I regretfully I have I have just one

15:53.040 --> 15:57.160
I just one thing to say about the vaccine shit, which is that I I

15:57.960 --> 16:00.880
Mean just to take one quick step back

16:00.880 --> 16:06.960
It is amazing to me that they can turn six dead in this trial into a terrifying thing

16:07.160 --> 16:13.440
Whenever like it went we went from a brand new disease to a vaccine in a year and a half

16:13.440 --> 16:17.800
That's a fucking miracle. It's a year and a half. Yeah, it's a

16:18.320 --> 16:20.600
miracle to have done that like not since

16:21.040 --> 16:27.800
Like what like they did it one time faster in like the 1950s like it's in a crazy miracle

16:27.800 --> 16:34.720
Yeah, and they're just like Oh six dead like wait 100 years ago. They would be like, this is the demon like this is incredible

16:34.720 --> 16:38.880
Yeah, and I didn't read that entire FDA document

16:38.880 --> 16:46.240
I was looking over the section about the severe and non severe adverse events and a lot of it didn't see it like

16:46.240 --> 16:51.720
You know, they have to report everything. Sure. So like there's like stats for number of people who had like

16:52.440 --> 16:59.020
The a rash. Yeah, exactly or like pain in the site of vaccination. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, all right

17:00.440 --> 17:02.760
Information is there. Yeah, you know, it's there

17:02.760 --> 17:09.140
Um, anyway, I agree. I agree. Yeah, but we have issues. We have issues to deal with. Okay

17:09.140 --> 17:12.220
I want to be a globalist. How do I get in?

17:13.800 --> 17:19.900
So we're really doing this, huh? Yeah, we're really gonna listen Joe Rogan talk shit

17:19.900 --> 17:23.940
I'm about people infinitely smarter than I'm gonna say this ahead of time. I

17:24.660 --> 17:28.860
Tried to steer away from conversation about how fucked up they are

17:28.860 --> 17:35.220
Yes, because I think that's kind of boring and it's not really all that like I would if I were in a studio with Joe

17:35.220 --> 17:40.700
Rogan, I'd probably be fucked up too. Yeah, it's kind of low-hanging fruit a little bit and it would become tires

17:40.700 --> 17:43.700
I think we just put a disclaimer up top. These guys are fucked up. Yeah

17:44.780 --> 17:51.980
Yeah, and I think that other like other people living their lives. I don't think there's anything wrong with being fucked up

17:51.980 --> 17:54.940
No, I do think that there's something probably wrong about Alex

17:54.940 --> 18:01.900
Presenting himself the way he does and then being super fucked up with Rogan and talking nonsense. Yeah. Yeah, whatever

18:01.900 --> 18:05.100
I don't really care that much. Yeah, I'm not a square whatever

18:05.840 --> 18:07.720
anyway, I

18:07.720 --> 18:09.720
Look, it's not as good as

18:11.400 --> 18:16.080
When he Alex was on Rogan, of course not because Alex isn't really trying to impress

18:16.420 --> 18:22.100
exactly as much as he is just trying to like solidify the bond between the two of them and yeah and

18:22.100 --> 18:24.620
Try and get whatever he can out of it

18:24.620 --> 18:28.340
But there is still a number of things that I think are important teachable moment. Sure

18:28.340 --> 18:35.120
I mean Rogan in Alex's studio isn't fun because at the it's like they're on more of an equal footing

18:35.600 --> 18:42.820
Like not in any cool footing but Alex doesn't have to supplicate himself quite as much because when you would

18:43.500 --> 18:45.500
Know oh no

18:45.500 --> 18:50.920
He really what do we start what a wine how dare you say you're an alpha

18:50.920 --> 18:53.380
Why don't why don't we start and listen to this alpha?

18:54.660 --> 18:58.700
Evil wars the most banned network in the world

18:59.100 --> 19:05.300
Well, I gotta tell you I get bigger goosebumps with this guy on the air the one I've had Donald Trump on and this movie

19:05.300 --> 19:06.500
Stars, no, seriously

19:06.500 --> 19:11.820
I've known you for 22 years and you're a fun really smart amazing guy and you've put up a lot of my crap and

19:11.820 --> 19:18.640
He's the number one not just podcaster but talk show host the world Joe Rogan my fellow Texan Alex Jones. Thanks for having me

19:19.320 --> 19:24.700
Supplication. Oh boy, right out of the go boy. Did he learn that from Stevie P's that level of

19:25.400 --> 19:27.400
Sequience. Yeah, it must have rubbed off. Yeah

19:28.080 --> 19:33.200
Over the years you just learn how to compliment people if you get your balls rubbed by Stevie P's enough

19:33.200 --> 19:37.400
So there's a there's a constant consistent thing throughout this

19:37.400 --> 19:42.240
Interview where Alex seems to want to hit a couple of points pretty hard

19:42.240 --> 19:47.960
Yeah, one of them is why did you move from LA? Sure. Why like how is Spotify?

19:47.960 --> 19:54.620
Tell me tell me everybody in LA is evil. Tell me Spotify is a great company to work with and they might be willing to

19:54.620 --> 19:56.620
Pay me

19:58.960 --> 20:03.440
Hey, they let me on the your show on Spotify, maybe they'll let my show on Spotify

20:03.440 --> 20:09.400
Yeah, and you know just a couple of other like pointed things run throughout

20:09.400 --> 20:12.740
Yeah, and so the Alex starts off with hey, man

20:13.200 --> 20:14.520
Why'd you leave LA?

20:14.520 --> 20:15.000
Mm-hmm

20:15.000 --> 20:21.960
I really love Texas for so long and I always was attached to LA because the comedy store because of business and just doing stand

20:21.960 --> 20:23.660
Up there and podcast there

20:23.660 --> 20:25.660
But once they locked everything down

20:25.840 --> 20:30.820
This was the logical place for me to move and and it for me it felt like I had a nice

20:30.820 --> 20:34.540
Excuse to move here and just like I thought about moving here for a long time

20:34.540 --> 20:40.380
But it didn't seem feasible and then as soon as the lockdowns happen and then the riots the looting and I was like I gotta

20:40.380 --> 20:45.960
Get the fuck out of LA. I don't believe that for a second. Uh-uh. It's almost certainly tax-related. Yep

20:47.580 --> 20:51.780
Just got a hundred million dollars and LA charges me a lot of money

20:51.780 --> 20:56.500
It turns out and I understand that, you know, Joe would perform in LA and and shit

20:56.500 --> 20:59.180
But like I don't think he lived in the city

20:59.180 --> 21:02.620
Mm-hmm. I don't think he lived anywhere where let's say

21:03.540 --> 21:09.360
Protests were no. No, there are so many looters and writers outside of Joe Rogan's neighborhood

21:10.100 --> 21:14.280
Recent hundred millionaire. I know Rogan's mill. I just don't buy it

21:14.280 --> 21:16.540
I find this brings artificial and false

21:16.540 --> 21:23.620
But it is probably about the best thing you could do as opposed to saying like I'm fucking loaded now. Yeah, I

21:24.980 --> 21:27.700
Don't need them anymore used to be rich

21:27.700 --> 21:29.700
I

21:30.740 --> 21:32.740
Could be comically rich anywhere

21:32.740 --> 21:39.060
I want and it just so happens that Texas is the state where I can stay the most comically

21:39.060 --> 21:45.260
I mean it was either Texas or moved to Miami and I don't think he's going to Miami. Yeah, so Alex also

21:45.820 --> 21:49.660
in with his sort of Steve pochenik esque buttering

21:50.420 --> 21:53.980
He's constantly asking Joe like why?

21:53.980 --> 21:57.420
What's it like to be the most famous person in the world?

21:58.100 --> 22:04.420
You were so successful early on in your career all this stuff. What's it like having the biggest dick anyone's ever seen

22:04.900 --> 22:06.900
What is it like more or less?

22:07.340 --> 22:12.140
Someone's said once a friend of mine said that I'm the bridge between the meatheads and the potheads

22:13.020 --> 22:16.660
I'd like to look at it that well, that was kind of my next angle of my next question

22:16.660 --> 22:19.300
I mean you've been doing podcasting over ten years, right?

22:19.300 --> 22:24.180
It's yeah. Yeah 2009. So it's almost 11 years. It'd be 11 years in December

22:25.180 --> 22:28.360
Away, I mean, I mean you've been big right away. You probably been no no

22:28.360 --> 22:31.660
No, it wasn't big at all in the beginning like literally no one was watching

22:31.660 --> 22:38.260
It was a it's part of the comedy show. We were watching we were watching Joe. Oh my god. Oh my god

22:38.820 --> 22:42.400
Little brother vibe. This isn't the fucking today's show

22:43.060 --> 22:44.380
Oh

22:44.380 --> 22:49.380
Yeah, I'll tell you you were successful early on despite your yeah, let me

22:52.060 --> 22:54.940
Tell you about your experience I know it better

22:55.340 --> 23:00.900
Yeah, I was here. So four minutes in to this interview four minutes

23:01.140 --> 23:05.460
They've had some pleasantries and it's like all just kind of like oh, yeah, you're so great

23:05.460 --> 23:11.100
It's so great to have you here awesome. They start smoking weed four minutes in on air. Let's go back to that

23:11.100 --> 23:15.660
That was my first question. How did you develop your worth at ethic and drive because I have some great tobacco

23:16.340 --> 23:18.340
Absolutely. I'll take a pop ball

23:22.420 --> 23:23.220
So they're good

23:23.220 --> 23:29.180
they're smoking weed and there was a meme that went around or like a video that someone put together from the

23:29.380 --> 23:34.660
Last time Alex was on Rogan and they spliced together things to make it sound like Alex wanted to have sex with Joe

23:34.660 --> 23:39.820
Oh and sort of it went around on Twitter and stuff. Oh, so Alex is constantly

23:39.820 --> 23:40.940
uh

23:40.940 --> 23:45.220
Leaning into that sure sure hoping that someone else makes a video. Right? Right, right

23:45.220 --> 23:52.260
It's really desperate and very pathetic right? Yeah, it's it's obnoxious. He's he's just

23:52.900 --> 23:55.780
Outrageously desperate to get a meme. Yes. Yeah

23:55.780 --> 24:02.580
I think that's what he wants more than even having Joe on is like somebody in Joe's audience will make something

24:03.060 --> 24:08.940
That'll go viral. Yeah, that's that's kind of the goal. I'm looking for 20,000 likes on something

24:08.940 --> 24:11.780
Yeah, and if you got to make fun of me, you got to make fun of me

24:11.780 --> 24:16.140
Hey, well, that's how people have really embraced me because I love being made fun of. Yes

24:16.140 --> 24:19.500
I don't get folks that don't like it. I love it. No you you get a kick out of him

24:19.740 --> 24:21.740
There's a show he would love that

24:23.740 --> 24:28.260
I have a podcast to recommend to him called fucking knowledge fight. I kind of enjoy it

24:28.260 --> 24:32.460
I don't think he's very serious. No, I kind of think that he has very thin skin

24:32.460 --> 24:40.060
I think he has a hair trigger as well. I think he might react negatively when he receives any criticism whatsoever

24:40.060 --> 24:44.300
Yeah, that could be mm-hmm. Well, I could be wrong though. Maybe he's an avid fan

24:44.300 --> 24:48.860
No, he does not like being made fun of but he likes to say that he likes being made fun of well

24:48.860 --> 24:49.580
It makes him look cool

24:49.580 --> 24:52.620
He kind of likes being made fun of in ways that are profitable to him though

24:52.620 --> 24:54.860
Like so if someone makes a meme that's poking fun at him

24:54.860 --> 24:59.980
He gets a ton of people and a ton of attention and his name is all over the place then he'll take it

24:59.980 --> 25:03.900
Yeah, I'll accept being made fun of for profit, right?

25:03.900 --> 25:10.100
Right, I will I will accept payment to be in the dunk tank. Yes, but I will not do it for fun. Yeah

25:10.100 --> 25:16.800
Yeah, he's a sad clown. Yes in many ways, but you know, it was not Joe Rogan Joe Rogan is the most famous

25:17.500 --> 25:23.780
He's the most famous person in the world. He is the Walter Cronkite of our time. Oh god

25:23.780 --> 25:24.620
No

25:24.620 --> 25:30.140
when did you realize that you were in the site guys because you were already in the site guys to hit TV shows and UFC and

25:30.140 --> 25:32.580
You know big movies and you know the national champion

25:32.580 --> 25:37.340
I mean you've had success since day one you had to fight hard for it. But what did you realize? Oh my god

25:37.340 --> 25:42.860
I'm like a real superstar not of some just empty movie or an empty actor that reads off a

25:43.260 --> 25:47.860
Teleprompter a script you get to be your own self and be the biggest that's that's that's very rare

25:47.860 --> 25:54.660
The tobacco is kicking in. I I don't know if I ever realized it. I'm not sure if I still realize it

25:54.660 --> 25:57.740
Come on, you got it. Like like what cuz I mean, I'm pretty super famous, too

25:58.740 --> 26:03.460
One of the reasons why I like pot is it makes me think about much more interesting things

26:03.660 --> 26:09.820
So like wolf, but I kind of respect that answer because it's a it's a really embarrassing question

26:09.820 --> 26:14.980
It is and for Joe as like a person like the graceful

26:14.980 --> 26:20.260
dignified way to respond to that is I don't think about that too much because

26:20.580 --> 26:25.740
To imagine that you do think about it is is gross. Yeah. Yeah

26:27.340 --> 26:30.380
Joe I have a quick question how often and

26:31.540 --> 26:36.220
Strenuously, do you sniff your own farts and believe them to be amazing? Could you just tell me real quick?

26:37.060 --> 26:41.140
Your farts don't stink obviously, sir, obviously, when did you first notice?

26:41.140 --> 26:45.820
Well, I mean like what other answer could he give that doesn't make him look like a shithead the fuck

26:49.420 --> 26:51.420
Well, I think it was about July

26:52.740 --> 26:55.700
2014 that I realized that I was the king of the world

26:56.540 --> 27:01.860
Isn't the great pothead meathead summit of 2016? Yeah, whatever I brought them to together. Yeah

27:02.340 --> 27:09.140
No one thought that I could reach day talk between the two but much like Steve pochenik solving all the world conflicts

27:09.140 --> 27:11.140
I solved the meathead jock

27:11.620 --> 27:12.860
pothead

27:12.860 --> 27:15.680
Conflict it turns out everybody likes doing nothing sometimes

27:16.340 --> 27:21.460
So Alex tried to destroy Joe when Joe said that he couldn't be on his show

27:22.860 --> 27:29.580
So as this goes yeah a couple times back when Alex was on he lied to Joe's face about Sandy Hook

27:29.580 --> 27:30.660
He did do that. Yes

27:30.660 --> 27:31.140
Yeah

27:31.140 --> 27:37.820
And apparently Joe found out about this and it was right around when a lot of attention was going on with the Sandy Hook suit

27:37.820 --> 27:42.100
might have been around the time Alex threatened to murder the opposing council or

27:42.620 --> 27:45.260
I'm sorry put out a million-dollar hit Wow

27:46.060 --> 27:48.620
What's a what's a million dollars between friends? Sure

27:48.620 --> 27:53.700
Yeah, so Joe said that Alex couldn't be on his show for the time being so that was resolved

27:53.700 --> 27:59.260
I said that Joe is a sneaky snake you that threatened to destroy him talking about his children

27:59.580 --> 28:04.140
Yeah, you didn't threaten to kill his well, but he was talking about them in a way that is very inappropriate

28:04.140 --> 28:06.380
I'm not happy for public discussion. No

28:06.380 --> 28:07.660
um

28:07.660 --> 28:10.420
Now looks kind of wants to say sorry about all that

28:11.100 --> 28:16.020
Well, I'm gonna mea copa some before you know the hardcore issues here with you tonight. We appreciate you being her Joe and

28:17.220 --> 28:20.500
That's that I've kind of gotten whacked out under all the pressure all the attacks

28:20.500 --> 28:23.900
Yeah, we've been over this so many times the opposite of Fame though

28:23.900 --> 28:29.620
It's like being I get Ellen is is is you almost start becoming the villain, but I just want to say the way you help man

28:29.620 --> 28:32.020
I wrote that was a big help. Well, we just

28:32.020 --> 28:36.900
I wrote for a long time and I think that's it's just a

28:37.540 --> 28:43.900
It's really a microcosm of what is happening online with people is that they're not talking to each other

28:44.100 --> 28:51.060
No, it's not. It is not a microcosm of what's going on with social media. No, no not communicating with each other

28:51.780 --> 28:56.380
It's very much a case of Alex trying to ride your coattails

28:57.460 --> 28:59.460
this is one of those things where I

28:59.460 --> 29:04.660
Remember this quote from Sinbad and I will till a day. I die the sailor or the comedian

29:05.420 --> 29:07.420
the comedian, okay

29:08.260 --> 29:10.260
Comics are funnier when they ride the bus

29:10.740 --> 29:17.260
Mmm, just that like simple like you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. You hundred millionaire dumbass

29:17.260 --> 29:23.940
Yeah, what are you talking about? What's going on online right now? Yeah, your experience is stupid. Yeah, sure and

29:24.460 --> 29:26.460
like Joe

29:26.460 --> 29:31.700
I I don't know what the fuck he thinks Alex does for a living

29:31.940 --> 29:38.140
Like I don't I don't know does he not know what Alex's show is about. He's never watched imagine

29:38.140 --> 29:43.200
He doesn't have the time. Does he imagine that Alex is talking about like real conspiracies still? Yeah

29:43.940 --> 29:45.640
cuz I

29:45.640 --> 29:50.460
He can't possibly know the horrible things Alex said about him for days

29:50.460 --> 29:57.020
Yeah, it's quite a bit. It's not just they needed to talk. Alex was turning their fight into content

29:57.020 --> 30:00.220
Yeah, but he was monetizing fighting between the two of them

30:00.220 --> 30:06.100
Yeah, if you were Joe's friend, wouldn't you be like hey, I saw I know you probably don't have time to see him for us

30:06.100 --> 30:11.620
But I saw this online and it's this whole long series of things that Joe said or that Alex said directly about you

30:11.620 --> 30:13.900
You should watch this and remember it forever

30:14.260 --> 30:20.300
Let's say that you're a friend of mine and we have a falling out and like maybe you're a high-profile person, too

30:20.300 --> 30:22.300
Mm-hmm. I wouldn't

30:22.700 --> 30:27.620
Have the instinct to threaten to destroy you for attention. Yeah on air

30:27.620 --> 30:31.220
Yeah, that's kind of in that's a bad person

30:31.340 --> 30:31.860
Yeah

30:31.860 --> 30:36.320
If I started my own show like we have a falling out and I start my own show and then all of a sudden

30:36.660 --> 30:42.420
You just start going on. I'm gonna kill Jordan rants one. Your show would become far more popular sneaky

30:43.380 --> 30:48.440
Too I would be very offended Dan. Yeah, that would hurt my feelings nonsense. Oh, we just needed to talk. Yeah

30:48.440 --> 30:54.560
Anyway, Alex carries on this charade that like he actually knows anything about what he's talking about

30:54.560 --> 30:57.000
And in this clip we kind of get the first

30:57.600 --> 31:04.440
Real meaty thing that I think happens and that is like a full demonstration of why Joe Rogan cannot do the things he's doing

31:05.000 --> 31:07.680
When I get into issues when I'm being serious

31:08.400 --> 31:11.680
I mean, I'm yeah, you can differ on my interpretation

31:11.760 --> 31:15.200
But if I'm saying I've got a clip or I've got something I've got it

31:15.200 --> 31:20.440
Well, that's why I wanted to clear podcast really clearly and I think we accomplished a great job, by the way

31:20.440 --> 31:24.560
I felt terrible that night you pat on the back. You said this will be the best one. You just got proven, right?

31:24.560 --> 31:26.240
I'm surprised almost everything you said was a car

31:26.240 --> 31:28.680
I thought if you there's been mistake and and and you were damn right

31:29.040 --> 31:33.320
My buddy Pat Raleigh was there and he said that was your best podcast with Joe ever. I went home depressed

31:33.440 --> 31:37.040
This is why Joe is not equipped to do the job that he's assigned for himself

31:37.600 --> 31:39.520
Joe didn't fact-check Alex

31:39.520 --> 31:45.320
But he gave just enough of the appearance of doing so to rationalize continuing his association with him

31:45.560 --> 31:50.240
Joe could have and should have completely destroyed Alex's career on that podcast

31:50.240 --> 31:54.600
but he didn't have the ammo that he needed to take that shot and because he didn't now that

31:54.760 --> 31:59.560
Podcast gets to be pointed to as a time when Alex's beliefs were really put to the test and he was found

32:00.040 --> 32:01.360
To be correct. Yep

32:01.360 --> 32:07.440
It's just a pathetic display from all parties and I find it difficult to imagine that Joe doesn't have some awareness of what he's doing

32:07.440 --> 32:12.800
And here's what makes me the most convinced of that on that last podcast that they did

32:12.840 --> 32:16.040
Alex presented Joe with information that he was previously unaware of

32:16.720 --> 32:23.180
The Rockefeller Foundation had a public plan called operation lockstep that is identical to the current kovat 19 response

32:23.720 --> 32:30.400
According to Alex everything that's happening now is planned 10 years ago by these evil globalists and the documents are easily accessible to prove it

32:30.400 --> 32:37.320
I do not believe that a sincere person would not finish the podcast and then immediately or at their first opportunity

32:37.320 --> 32:39.320
Check that claim

32:39.400 --> 32:42.320
Alex can either be right or wrong if he's wrong

32:42.320 --> 32:45.280
Your friend is a liar and he's using your platform to spread misinformation

32:45.480 --> 32:49.200
That's gonna get people killed and you're complicit in it if he's right

32:49.200 --> 32:51.080
There's a very easily provable

32:51.080 --> 32:57.120
Conspiracy to kill off the population using the illusion of an outbreak and it seems like knowing that for certain would be pretty important

32:57.400 --> 33:01.720
The only thing that really makes sense here is if Joe is treating Alex like Eddie Bravo

33:01.880 --> 33:04.160
It's fun to talk to him about the crazy bullshit

33:04.160 --> 33:09.680
He believes but there's literally no reason to take any of it seriously or think about it for a second outside of his presence

33:10.160 --> 33:15.440
Joe's not gonna dig into whether the earth is flat after hanging out with Eddie and he's not gonna research the fake

33:15.520 --> 33:19.340
Operation lockstep after hanging out with Alex because he takes them equally seriously

33:19.740 --> 33:22.740
Joe probably thinks that what he's doing is fine and innocent enough

33:22.880 --> 33:27.640
But he's doing a lot of damage and doing a bad job while pretending to fact-check Alex

33:27.640 --> 33:33.300
Yeah, if you just want to shoot the shit with your friend fine. Once you step into the game of like

33:33.300 --> 33:38.800
Validating his conspiracies and pretending that you're doing some kind of rigor or due diligence on this

33:39.040 --> 33:46.080
You're giving Alex all the carte blanche to your audience that he needs. Mm-hmm. You're basically selling your audience to him

33:46.080 --> 33:48.680
Yeah, you can't I'd like the first sentence

33:48.680 --> 33:54.520
He said is just like we can differ on interpretation and it's like you on some things you can

33:54.520 --> 33:58.560
But there are things that are or are not it's not everything is not

33:58.560 --> 34:05.800
Differable on interpretation and then second you always have the documents. Why why would you say that?

34:06.080 --> 34:09.080
Why would you say he always has the documents luck? Is it the joke?

34:09.960 --> 34:13.620
Yeah, I hate it. Yeah. No, it's it's sad. That's pathetic

34:13.620 --> 34:19.320
So Alex is a gift for Joe not only the gift of ass kisser II and nonsense

34:19.320 --> 34:23.680
He also has physical gifts. Okay, you've given me a lot of great UFC tickets

34:23.680 --> 34:27.280
But really nice to me for 20 plus years and I've never really gotten you anything

34:27.280 --> 34:32.520
And I've seen people give you gifts on the show using some PR thing that they're selling. I don't know any stock in this

34:32.520 --> 34:34.600
It's a it's a great rifle. I really enjoy it

34:35.040 --> 34:38.840
And so this is something where you can go get four or five grizzly bears

34:38.840 --> 34:43.920
That's so Texas grizzly bears at the same time. What are these rounds? I'm gonna guys bring the rifle in here

34:43.920 --> 34:49.720
So this is your gift along with that box of cigars. You very much. So I got him cigars and rifle like

34:50.160 --> 34:55.860
It's just like a parody of masculinity. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's really that's really bad. Mm-hmm

34:55.860 --> 35:00.500
That would be a little bit too on-the-nose in a movie. I would be like, okay guys, we get it

35:00.500 --> 35:06.760
They're supposedly men your bros. Yeah. All right. Yeah. This is a man cave. I gotcha. All right

35:06.760 --> 35:10.600
Here's where it gets easy to pull it back. Here's where it gets even worse now remember it

35:10.600 --> 35:16.640
They're smoking weed and drinking booze and booze and he is just gifted Joe a rifle right and then Alex says this

35:17.120 --> 35:20.240
It's really wild when you go pick up the rifle and try it out a little bit

35:20.240 --> 35:23.840
Don't you pick try it out? You know what I mean? Just check it out. Let's just put it away

35:23.840 --> 35:29.240
I know what a rifle is. I got a bunch of all right. How Texas is this? That is the right response

35:29.240 --> 35:34.760
Yeah, yeah, that's a good response. I was very I was very afraid because generally whatever info wars

35:34.760 --> 35:40.280
Hey pick up that rifle is a of course. I'll pick up that rifle Alex Jones the pinnacle of gun safety

35:40.280 --> 35:42.280
Just the guy who loves the Second Amendment

35:43.080 --> 35:48.480
Responsible gun ownership. Hey, don't shoot it. Don't shoot it. Hey, what are you test out that rifle?

35:48.480 --> 35:55.000
No, give it a go. Give it a go inside. Don't shoot it though. Just swing it around Wow pointed at your friends

35:55.000 --> 35:57.920
so they get to talking about like

35:58.680 --> 36:00.960
sort of meds and medication and

36:02.520 --> 36:07.920
Joe knows some people who have mixed drugs with meds and it's had a bad response. Oh

36:08.680 --> 36:13.200
Some side effects there's different people with different side effects, you know

36:13.200 --> 36:19.760
And and some people are seeing it with things and cocaine, you know, there's a lot of people that say that mixing it with cocaine

36:19.760 --> 36:23.120
Turns you psychotic and oral heart makes life say Xanax. It's not

36:23.880 --> 36:26.560
Terrible for you and a lot of people do it. It's terrible for you

36:26.560 --> 36:32.440
They say don't drink on this people are yeah, okay, and they drink on it, right? The problem isn't the meds though

36:32.440 --> 36:37.660
Yeah, it's yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's the one it's that it's the inverse of what you think is

36:37.660 --> 36:43.600
Yeah, I can't do my coke on these meds. No, you're sir, sir. Let me back you up one step

36:43.600 --> 36:47.780
That is what it does kind of seem to me that well, I can't stop doing

36:51.200 --> 36:56.800
Free basin for ten years now and just cuz you want me to take this med. Oh my cholesterol is high

36:56.800 --> 37:02.560
Yeah, fuck you. Mixing booze and Xanax is really dangerous. So people who are on Xanax

37:03.340 --> 37:05.340
Who actually use it as prescribed

37:05.340 --> 37:13.660
It's a little bit like you say no, I'm on booze. I'm taking Xanax. Okay, that's that's my recreation. It's very strange

37:14.820 --> 37:19.740
Also, very strange to hear that Joe's position on marijuana is evolving a little bit

37:19.740 --> 37:25.560
And I think that's probably good because I I think for everything I could tell there is a little bit of a cartoonish

37:26.200 --> 37:29.140
pro marijuana cartoonish carte blanche of

37:29.140 --> 37:36.180
Like like permissiveness to yeah, it's all good. Nothing bad can ever come of we yeah, I think that was kind of a position

37:36.180 --> 37:42.540
He may have presented earlier on it's not addictive and you blow the smoke in your four-year-olds face. It's good stuff move on

37:42.540 --> 37:49.140
He's now evolved a little bit into a position where it seems like he is is aware that sometimes it can have negative outcomes

37:49.580 --> 37:53.140
You know, I've been more and more open over the last few years

37:53.140 --> 37:58.940
Especially to recognize that pots not always safe and I don't think it's a good idea to tell everybody it's always safe

37:58.940 --> 38:05.140
Well, they made it so strong that it's definitely been connected to increases in schizophrenia. I have no I don't know if it's from the

38:06.060 --> 38:11.240
Potency perspective. I think maybe it's always happened and we just didn't

38:12.460 --> 38:13.900
two people

38:13.900 --> 38:20.980
Personally who were normal and started smoking a lot of pot and went crazy. I do as well including edibles

38:20.980 --> 38:26.740
I know people who have them worked here. One of them started thinking that everyone was reptiles. Wait, that's David. I

38:26.740 --> 38:29.520
Was saying that I got bad news for you

38:30.940 --> 38:34.820
If those people worked it in for us previously, they weren't normal

38:35.880 --> 38:40.700
They weren't starting from like really grounded place and then they started smoking weed

38:42.060 --> 38:44.340
They started listening to me. Yeah. Yeah

38:46.060 --> 38:52.000
Sign that this person had lost it is that they thought everyone was reptiles. Yeah when in reality everyone is

38:52.660 --> 38:54.660
interdimensional demons, duh

38:54.660 --> 38:58.660
What are you? What are you high? That's the difference between mental health

38:59.780 --> 39:04.140
Losing it is do you think people are reptiles or do you think they're interdimensional demons?

39:04.140 --> 39:06.780
You know what? I don't I don't understand why people would listen to this

39:06.780 --> 39:12.980
I don't understand why people would listen to two people have the same dumb thoughts. You could already have at home

39:12.980 --> 39:16.860
Oh, you know no totally like like this is dumb as hell

39:16.860 --> 39:19.740
Like I have thoughts that you can think of at home

39:19.740 --> 39:25.560
But it's interesting because you have knowledge and research and shit. Well now we're both just being like, hey

39:25.560 --> 39:29.900
I half remember the content of this thing that I might have read one of the reasons

39:29.900 --> 39:36.460
I ultimately decided to do this episode was because I'm looking forward to Monday and we have the

39:36.780 --> 39:40.300
The trip to DC sure for the episode on Monday. Sure

39:40.300 --> 39:45.700
I don't know when we'll have time to get to the Rogan episode if not now, of course, and then the other more

39:45.700 --> 39:52.600
Motivating factor was that it is something that people are curious about people are curious about like what a four-hour

39:52.660 --> 39:57.060
Fucking episode unreal and no one should have to listen to no one. It's so long

39:57.060 --> 40:02.380
It's mean there were long stretches where I was listening to this and I'm just like I don't care

40:02.380 --> 40:08.220
I don't care. No, cuz cuz there are parts that are just like, okay. This is just a stupid conversation

40:08.220 --> 40:09.460
It's not really relevant

40:09.460 --> 40:16.280
Yeah, it's it's not that entertaining just talking about like a fun time you all had or something like Joe

40:16.280 --> 40:20.200
Rogan does like 10 minutes about how great Joey Diaz is as a comedian. He is great

40:31.820 --> 40:37.140
There's so much there's like skip and so I'll save people the time I'll listen to it for you

40:37.140 --> 40:41.660
Thank you, and we can just listen to the parts that are interesting like finding out the two of Alex

40:41.660 --> 40:45.420
Oh, there's gonna be a short into the grass. Of course, then they lost their minds, right?

40:46.840 --> 40:48.220
also

40:48.220 --> 40:54.900
Alex thinks that he's interviewing Joe kinda. Uh-huh, but the tables turn. Oh, I talk about interdimensional things

40:54.900 --> 40:58.840
That's what the globalists believe in. Have you ever had an interdimensional experience? Here we go

41:00.660 --> 41:02.660
Well, I'm interviewing Joe Rogan

41:02.660 --> 41:08.140
Why are we interviewing each other man? No, no, no, we're not I just want to get all the cool stuff out

41:08.180 --> 41:10.180
Let's just talk. Okay, I'll tell you

41:10.820 --> 41:17.940
So he did not want to answer that question. He wanted to dodge that if you were an interdimensional experience explain to me how that

41:18.980 --> 41:21.740
Question can blow you away if it's like

41:22.980 --> 41:27.340
I talk about interdimensional stuff. Of course. That's what the globalists believe. Have you ever had one?

41:27.340 --> 41:33.020
Because if I say yes, then I would have to admit that I also believe in that shit

41:33.020 --> 41:34.540
And that's kind of probably gonna sound bad

41:34.540 --> 41:39.140
It sounds silly for me to say that's what the globalists believe if I've experienced it and I know it's real

41:39.140 --> 41:44.140
It kind of makes me look like an idiot that if I say no, then the globalists are just a bunch of

41:44.660 --> 41:50.020
Yeah, those who have beliefs that aren't true. Yep. What kind of power is there in that? Not a lot

41:50.020 --> 41:55.620
Yeah, kind of a trap. Okay, so Alex doesn't really answer but then he does he does say this

41:55.620 --> 42:02.780
I don't want to make this about me, but I could actually shift into a psychic awareness a psychic awareness

42:02.780 --> 42:06.140
Although the higher level how well do you think you'd do at rock-paper-scissors?

42:06.980 --> 42:09.180
You know, we can joke about that probably pretty good

42:15.460 --> 42:22.440
You better win every time exactly I'll give you a minute to shift into your psychic state and you better win

42:22.440 --> 42:25.700
All right, that is full of shit that is huge

42:26.480 --> 42:31.920
You I don't have to do any voices vibe out of this guy. Yes. Yeah, I

42:32.560 --> 42:36.960
Can know I don't know about interdimensional experiences, but I can shift into a psychic state

42:40.640 --> 42:46.440
Maybe I would hope so. Anyway, Alex has a good example of when he has done this in the past

42:46.960 --> 42:49.220
No, but I know how to you know

42:49.220 --> 42:53.500
I let's just say I I wouldn't call the exaggeration

42:54.020 --> 42:56.780
It'll be accelerated to the next power where they claim

42:56.780 --> 43:02.500
It's like actual projection or remote viewing right but but I can't control it had a lot of dreams to come exactly true later

43:02.500 --> 43:05.700
And I've called a lot of things like two months for 9-11

43:05.700 --> 43:08.620
I said they're gonna blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on been live what simple said

43:08.620 --> 43:12.940
How did you know how to dream about it kept having a recurring dream? What? Yeah, did you talk about this Larry?

43:12.940 --> 43:17.800
Yeah, there's videos over here. No. Yeah, so I can't really control it. Holy shit

43:17.800 --> 43:22.980
So that's amazing. But that's only one data points. It's not amazing. No, it's not we've talked about we did

43:22.980 --> 43:24.980
I think a whole episode about why it's not

43:25.540 --> 43:31.140
But like that's that that's just one piece of data. What if he had a second dream that came?

43:31.180 --> 43:36.660
Okay kept having this recurring dream of a guy in a pink and green striped sweater. Mm-hmm

43:36.660 --> 43:42.260
When I walk around the side of a building attacking me with like a club Bill Gates and and and and as you wear

43:42.260 --> 43:47.740
What is it Roger sweaters and we used to drive into town? It was like 15, but with older kids to get alcohol

43:47.740 --> 43:50.620
He had to drive into downtown Dallas to get alcohol and weed

43:50.620 --> 43:53.140
We got a like little crack houses, but we're buying weed on them

43:53.140 --> 43:58.720
And then I was going around the side of all these buildings and it was a white crackhead and he tried to attack me

43:58.720 --> 44:02.260
I'd have the exact dream a whole bunch of times and miss when he tried to club me in the head

44:02.300 --> 44:05.980
So it was like it was like it was like my psychic understanding to get past that point

44:06.100 --> 44:08.820
Happened like two months later. I kept having the dream of this guy

44:08.820 --> 44:13.180
I'm all sudden walk around this house to buy some weed wasn't a big weed guy, but we're driving out again for girls

44:13.180 --> 44:18.260
And this guy tries to club me in the head and crackhead and it's the same guy from the dream. Jesus Christ

44:18.260 --> 44:22.980
Yeah those dreams so you've had two of those big ones. You've had a lot of other ones. Yeah a lot of them

44:22.980 --> 44:26.240
Wow, these are the two examples that he uses though. Holy shit

44:26.340 --> 44:31.580
So I guess maybe that was like he'd seen Nightmare on Elm Street

44:31.580 --> 44:35.460
I guess like that's so that's so bullshit

44:35.460 --> 44:41.660
Fuck don't I have one rule don't ever tell anybody about your dreams unless it's a sex dream with someone interesting

44:41.660 --> 44:47.140
No one else. No one cares about anything else. Yeah, I'm positive that I could come up with some stories

44:47.660 --> 44:51.520
Of dreams I had that I could make match things that happen. Yeah. Yeah

44:52.620 --> 44:59.540
Anybody you can fudge the details cuz it's a dream, right? You don't perfectly remember any of this fuck off. Yeah

44:59.540 --> 44:59.860
Yeah

44:59.860 --> 45:05.860
So this is the Alex gets back to the 9-eleven prediction and he says something that I actually think is a real problem

45:06.300 --> 45:10.500
Well, there was a two-hour thing. I did it in July 25th

45:11.380 --> 45:16.300
2001 I went ahead and went on air and they're gonna blow the World Trade Center blend on the CIS have been live then launch all

45:16.300 --> 45:21.300
These wars and and I said, oh I just got this from analysis and information, but I kept having the dream

45:22.300 --> 45:24.340
The towers smoking all the rest of it

45:24.340 --> 45:30.300
So what I what I want to point out and take issue with here is that Alex admits that he lied

45:30.620 --> 45:37.260
About what the information source was. Yeah, he is saying I said that it was based on analysis

45:37.260 --> 45:42.420
But really it was the product of a prophetic dream that I had right because he knew in

45:43.020 --> 45:46.980
2000 that he could not say I had a dream about this

45:46.980 --> 45:54.180
That would be very very silly and I would suggest that if this is all true and Alex is being he's reporting

45:54.180 --> 45:59.020
this accurately then what happened was he was listening to a ton of Bill Cooper and

45:59.860 --> 46:03.900
Patriot ass radio back then and at that point in time it seeped into his subconscious

46:04.340 --> 46:09.220
Bill Cooper was saying very similar things and that's why he was dreaming about it

46:09.460 --> 46:14.180
Yeah, that's and you combine that with the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center

46:14.620 --> 46:19.700
The feelings like bin Laden was somebody who was known at the time

46:19.700 --> 46:25.500
Well, and he did say he was going to bomb the World Trade Center. There's that he was very explicit about it

46:25.500 --> 46:27.380
Too like a long time in advance, right?

46:27.380 --> 46:35.100
So like Alex's dreams about this or more likely the product of influences that he had sure and then he got on air and

46:35.260 --> 46:40.980
Pretended that he was some kind of expert had some analysis and that's kind of a microcosm of his career

46:40.980 --> 46:45.260
Yeah, yeah ending that he has information that he's just coming up with out of his fantasies

46:45.260 --> 46:53.180
Yeah, I would say that what he's done is invalidate any time he's ever said that he predicted 9-eleven as being like a result of

46:53.780 --> 46:58.420
Work. Yeah, so at best you had a dream you had a dream, right?

46:58.420 --> 47:03.400
So then I will so then if you could your entire career is based on a lie

47:03.540 --> 47:09.500
Unless you are selling yourself as a pure psychic who can predict things as opposed to analyze them

47:09.500 --> 47:13.660
And it calls into question other times that he said he's analyzed things or he has information

47:13.660 --> 47:17.100
Is he actually just lying about the dream? Yeah

47:17.740 --> 47:25.140
How seriously should you take any information that he provides if he was willing to pass off a prediction about a terrorist attack as?

47:25.980 --> 47:30.660
Analysis when it was actually a dream. Well, he did say Chicago was gonna be nuked. How are we doing? We're fine

47:30.660 --> 47:36.140
Oh might have had a dream. Oh shit. We might still be fucked. But he had a dream. Yeah, that sounds about right

47:36.300 --> 47:39.880
So look, this is an interview. Mm-hmm. They're gonna get down to the nitty-gritty

47:39.880 --> 47:46.280
They're gonna get down and find out what the truth is unless Joe doesn't want to have an interview. Okay

47:46.280 --> 47:48.360
So what are you in the comedy Oh

47:49.800 --> 47:51.800
Alex this is so forced

47:52.640 --> 47:55.080
What got me in the comedy it is not forced it is

47:55.960 --> 48:02.640
Questions like we're doing an interview. No, I'm just because I actually but we're I can talk plenty. Look out. No, I know

48:02.640 --> 48:08.080
Let's talk well you don't follow those if you were magically made ruler of the world

48:08.080 --> 48:11.520
Oh, geez, what are three things you would do to change the world as it is?

48:12.800 --> 48:16.040
Alex Jones never does this. I'm being different. I understand

48:16.040 --> 48:20.420
I don't think the two of them want to are they're working on the exact same page here. I think no

48:22.040 --> 48:28.720
Alex is kind of wanting to get something again. Joe just wants to have a conversation. It's still funny anymore

48:28.720 --> 48:35.440
He's charismatic. Yeah, I mean I thought I would I would expect he would go for a joke every now and again

48:35.440 --> 48:39.120
I think he comes off pretty well. Okay, at least all right, okay

48:39.120 --> 48:44.200
I think he says a number of really stupid things sure, but at the same time like I you know watching this

48:44.200 --> 48:46.200
I was thinking like I could probably

48:46.680 --> 48:48.400
Hang out with Rogan Wow

48:48.400 --> 48:52.720
I could probably get along with him as long as we didn't get into these sorts of topics. Sure

48:52.720 --> 48:56.340
Sure, I think it might be fun. And as long as it wasn't like a show

48:56.340 --> 49:00.240
I mean, I wouldn't want to do like I wouldn't want to be on his show. Yeah

49:00.240 --> 49:05.080
Yeah, just hanging out socially having a conversation. I think he could probably probably be a lot of fun

49:06.320 --> 49:10.120
Definitely hung out and had social conversations in green rooms with far worse people

49:12.120 --> 49:16.040
He's able to like Alex you're forcing it why yeah asking a question

49:16.320 --> 49:23.240
When did I get into comedy right like yeah that that is that's an indication at least on some level that he's willing to have

49:23.240 --> 49:30.320
You know conversation that's not that's true boring. That's true. So but in terms of him being funny. I'm not I'm not a hundred percent sure

49:31.680 --> 49:35.980
But Alex thinks he's funny. How about this kill fucker fight? Oh

49:39.640 --> 49:43.520
Well, I don't want to kill him you're gonna fuck him and I don't want to fight him

49:43.520 --> 49:46.480
I don't want to hurt him. It probably be the most gentle if I fuck him

49:46.480 --> 49:53.520
All right, we don't like to keep him alive. No, that's rude that and then you're just making a mockery of it

49:53.520 --> 49:55.520
Oh, you want a personal mama bill? Yes

49:56.400 --> 49:57.520
I

49:57.520 --> 50:04.000
You know, I'm trying to feed the memes right now. So desperate. Oh desperate. I get a meme going. That's really bad

50:04.000 --> 50:06.840
Yeah, that's kind of heart-wrenching. Yeah, it's it's

50:07.520 --> 50:09.400
Cringy, it's very cringy

50:09.400 --> 50:14.760
Yeah, especially since he's he's trying to it seems like he's getting so much mileage out of just saying fuck

50:14.760 --> 50:21.360
Just like kill fuck fight, you know, you want him to say that it's like it's like a family feud question

50:21.360 --> 50:24.860
We're like you want grandma to say tits. We know it

50:24.860 --> 50:30.600
Yeah, there's a little bit of a problem too in that like Joe doesn't seem to hate Bill Gates. Whereas Alex

50:31.440 --> 50:36.480
It claims to know that he runs the world and wants to kill everyone sure

50:36.480 --> 50:42.440
There is Alex doesn't challenge Joe on his non hatred of Bill Gates, which seems weird

50:42.440 --> 50:49.600
I'm considering everything Alex says about Bill Gates all the time, but I would have said, you know, he's one of the 12

50:52.680 --> 50:54.680
Maybe he's middle management

50:55.680 --> 51:00.640
That's true when when Alex was on Joe's podcast last it was a disgraceful

51:01.520 --> 51:06.780
Showing, you know, there were just tons and tons of things that were factually inaccurate

51:08.160 --> 51:10.160
emotionally inaccurate

51:10.160 --> 51:16.840
And manipulative at the very least. Yes, and you know, we did our episode about it and if anybody's interested they can find

51:17.520 --> 51:19.520
cataloging of them there

51:19.520 --> 51:25.400
But Joe seems to think that people were desperate to find something that Alex was wrong about

51:26.000 --> 51:32.360
Let's go ahead and play it's Bill Gates himself saying that the vaccine made 80% of the people ill

51:32.360 --> 51:37.640
Which is exactly what you said on the podcast and people were complaining and they were they were angry

51:37.640 --> 51:40.560
They were trying to find something that you said that was wrong

51:40.560 --> 51:46.000
It was so hard as we basically checked everything you said and all that proved to be accurate

51:46.000 --> 51:51.480
so then we got to this part where you said 80% of the people that took the vaccine got sick and people are like he's

51:51.560 --> 51:56.780
Spreading anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. So I said, okay. Listen, here's the video

51:56.840 --> 52:01.560
We're not desperate to find things that Alex is wrong about it was not a struggle really. No

52:01.560 --> 52:13.640
Oh, it's kind of a Google search honestly. Kind of exhausting. It's a bit of a Google search. It was an exhausting cataloging of things that he was wrong about that took for fucking ever

52:15.120 --> 52:21.780
But Joe I don't understand how he can possibly not recognize that Alex was lying like that

52:22.240 --> 52:27.960
Project lockstep operation lockstep thing is like so glaring that he should never talk to Alex ever again

52:27.960 --> 52:35.000
But he seems to think that everybody was so desperate to find one the thing one place where Alex didn't dot his

52:35.360 --> 52:42.540
Eye or cross his teeth see this this is a struggle because it does seem like he doesn't take Alex seriously

52:43.840 --> 52:46.160
So, how can you also say that?

52:47.000 --> 52:53.080
You know, that's the conflict that I have like he doesn't take this information seriously. Yeah, obviously

52:53.080 --> 52:57.960
So, how can you say that it's proven and then not react to it really like it's a an issue

52:57.960 --> 53:04.680
How can you go out of your way to rationalize Alex and sell him to your audience while at the same time?

53:05.040 --> 53:12.520
Not taking a step and seeing if his fucking conspiracy about the plan to destroy everyone in the present

53:12.520 --> 53:15.840
Yeah, using kovat 19 has any credence to it?

53:15.840 --> 53:20.880
How could you be that not curious if you're willing to vouch for him? Oh

53:20.880 --> 53:28.760
How how could you believe that that stuff has been proven and not use five of your hundred million dollars

53:28.920 --> 53:36.240
To do something about it. Yeah yours. He's if you believe what Alex is saying then the elites are killing all of us

53:36.880 --> 53:42.160
Murdering us all and you have a hundred million dollars. You should buy info. You could do something about it

53:42.160 --> 53:46.840
How do you not make that just oh, I'm just a regular old guy just being trampled

53:46.840 --> 53:52.600
Down to the machines. Yeah, fuck you. Well, I don't I don't know what his answer to that would be

53:52.600 --> 53:58.240
And I don't understand how he can have this completely bizarre relationship with with Alex. Yeah, it's weird

53:58.240 --> 53:59.720
It doesn't make any sense now

53:59.720 --> 54:04.320
But I think one of the ways that he's able to play it publicly is to be like yeah

54:04.440 --> 54:10.800
Everyone's just mad about things that you say because you're saying them. They're too attached to the messenger

54:10.800 --> 54:18.000
Sure, people get trapped into the messenger. They get trapped into the messenger instead of listening to the information a

54:18.320 --> 54:25.100
Fucking moron might have something important to say you never know when someone isn't. Thank you Joe

54:25.160 --> 54:31.440
Not you, but if someone's an idiot at most things and they come to you with one fact someone could be a fucking liar

54:32.120 --> 54:38.000
All the time, but then they come to you with one fact that they saw on TV, you know, get the fuck out of here

54:38.000 --> 54:44.560
That's where crying wolf comes from right? Absolutely knows that a couple of did you learn the wrong lesson from the very story?

54:44.560 --> 54:45.520
You just reference

54:45.520 --> 54:45.800
Yeah

54:45.800 --> 54:52.000
the lesson supposed to be like in that story is that when you cry wolf a bunch of times and there is no wolf people will

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Not believe you

54:55.280 --> 55:01.720
The lesson of that story isn't that the people who stop believing someone who constantly lied about there being a wolf or wrong to

55:01.720 --> 55:04.400
Not believe him the last time that's a completely bizarre

55:04.400 --> 55:10.680
Interpretation of that story the takeaway is supposed to be that if you're a liar and the lies you're telling affect other people

55:10.680 --> 55:15.440
You can cause serious damage to people with your lies because the time you're telling the truth about a threat

55:15.440 --> 55:21.160
They might not believe you. Uh-huh. Alex is kind of the boy who cried wolf except in his version

55:21.160 --> 55:22.540
There still isn't a wolf at the end

55:22.540 --> 55:29.400
He's just continuing to lie and the boy is getting rich selling anti wolf pills to a particularly gullible set of people in town

55:29.400 --> 55:35.880
Yeah, there's an issue there. Also. This is a critically important point Joe is saying that people cannot hear the things

55:35.880 --> 55:39.520
Alex says and evaluate them on their merits because they're caught up in the messenger

55:39.560 --> 55:43.020
They hate Alex and so he must be wrong about everything

55:43.640 --> 55:48.560
This is exactly the problem with how Joe engages with Alex just in the reverse

55:48.840 --> 55:55.080
It's Joe who's completely caught up on the messenger and refuses to accept the possibility that Alex is a malignant narcissist

55:55.080 --> 56:01.680
Who is not his friend. I hate Alex Jones more than most people and I can easily separate my feelings about how repulsive

56:01.680 --> 56:05.580
He is from whether or not specific claims he makes are based in reality

56:05.600 --> 56:11.040
It's not a difficult exercise because I care because I believe that there's a reason that this matters

56:11.560 --> 56:17.680
For all Joe's talk about ideas and good ideas beating bad ideas. He doesn't think any of this shit

56:17.680 --> 56:19.080
He's talking about matters

56:19.080 --> 56:24.040
He's trapped by the illusion in his head that he's created where Alex is a good guy who means well

56:24.040 --> 56:29.880
Which he only believes because the two of them have gotten fucked up together a couple times and said offensive things to each other

56:29.880 --> 56:33.720
Which is bonding I guess and Alex gave him a rifle cigars, too

56:33.720 --> 56:38.840
I challenge Joe to take his own of advice and separate the messenger from the message

56:39.120 --> 56:46.360
Start with operation lockstep and go from there and consider the possibility that this person you insist is your friend is actually a dangerous liar

56:46.880 --> 56:50.640
Yeah, I do. I mean it to your point. Yeah. Okay, Joe

56:50.640 --> 56:55.720
Then do you watch like the other conservative news networks whenever they say all that bullshit?

56:55.720 --> 56:58.960
Do you go? Well, obviously I must believe them because it's true

56:59.840 --> 57:03.920
That's the only because they're not that no that's that's so fucked up

57:03.920 --> 57:10.600
He's absolutely tied to the to just I will defend Alex no matter what. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's

57:11.680 --> 57:12.600
sucks

57:12.600 --> 57:18.480
Well, I mean it kind of sucks, but it also is really gaslighting to say people who yeah like disagree

57:18.480 --> 57:25.440
But can't possibly have substance-based reasons for disagreeing. We just hate Alex all about it's all about your feelings

57:25.440 --> 57:30.160
It's always it's he's creating this archetype of like all criticism is coming from

57:30.840 --> 57:38.060
SJW snowflakes who are all mad because Alex Jones is too manly or something sure and then like it that's so

57:38.460 --> 57:44.540
Boring, you're like trafficking in this like fetishization of ideas and that's the idea you have

57:44.540 --> 57:51.780
Well, what it is we've done 500 something episodes of this podcast about substance. Yeah, that's wrong with Alex Jones

57:51.780 --> 57:58.020
It's not I don't I'm not just mad at him. Yeah, we would have stopped a long time ago. I was just mad at him

57:58.020 --> 58:00.180
Yeah, yeah, it's such bullshit Joe

58:00.180 --> 58:07.500
It's it's just like with Alex's fears of and then being like on the other side and he wants those things to happen

58:07.820 --> 58:11.940
It's what he's afraid of is the things that he desires in the same way

58:11.940 --> 58:16.740
Joe is what he's really expressing is I react to things based on how I feel

58:17.100 --> 58:23.260
So I assume that others react to things based on how they feel. I can't imagine them

58:24.100 --> 58:31.100
Breaking free of the the mold that I exist in because obviously if I have a hundred million dollars the things I think are important

58:31.100 --> 58:38.100
They're not just feelings that I have or fucking fake prophetic ass dreams that I have that must be where their

58:38.100 --> 58:44.880
Criticism comes from as well. Yeah, and I mean Joe even gets into this kind of thing a little bit later here

58:44.880 --> 58:48.640
I'll even go to this. I'll jump forward a little bit because it's really relevant

58:48.640 --> 58:53.400
I'll go to this clip here because he's talking about like how people shape their ideas

58:53.440 --> 58:59.880
And I think that this might be how he has right or it feels like projecting

59:00.120 --> 59:05.240
This is the thing. It's like like you you're allowed to have other ideas

59:05.240 --> 59:09.800
But the whole idea of who you are and what life is is

59:10.200 --> 59:15.040
Mostly shaped by what you think is gonna give you the least resistance from the people that are around

59:15.040 --> 59:20.320
But that's the Liberals always liked was the fact that they were open and free and believed in speech

59:20.320 --> 59:25.280
And even though I disagree with them on some points they agree with my overall freedom. I'm so high

59:25.280 --> 59:27.880
I don't even know what I just said. You said something really smart

59:27.880 --> 59:37.780
I agree. I'm a bullshitter. So I know that Joe's discounting his own point because he's all high and shit, but the the

59:39.520 --> 59:43.040
Presumption that you mold your identity by with that which

59:43.760 --> 59:51.080
Ideas these ideas that will cause the least tension with the people around you. Mm-hmm. That's not how everyone lives

59:51.080 --> 59:56.480
No, that's not very much personal experience. A lot of times your personality is formed by conflict

59:56.480 --> 59:58.080
It's formed by tension

59:58.080 --> 01:00:04.960
with groups that you don't fit in with having to find new people that you get along with better because

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:12.680
That's that's nonsensical. Yeah. Yeah, I I can't handle this. I get it

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.640
There's ideas and you can look at things from a different way

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:20.640
But we also have to exist in a world where some things are and some things are not

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:27.280
Mm-hmm. Everything is not open to interpretation. No, it just can't be otherwise we get places where it's like

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.760
We think there's voter fraud

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:35.160
So there was no things at there at a certain point something is or is not we can't live in a no

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:40.680
This is just how I interpret things like that's just not how we can share a universe. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:44.680
Yeah, but I will say that they're modeling it for us

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:51.040
Here with Alex and Joe. That's why it's so shitty. They're two completely different people and they're getting along

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:56.040
They voted for different people. Did you know that Rogan didn't vote for Trump? What?

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:01.840
Listen, I voted for Joe Jorgensen. I voted for the libertarian because I think we should probably

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.040
You know, I'm voting out of California

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:11.040
So I'm like we should support third-party candidates because that's one of the solutions. I'd love to grill him on Jorgensen's position

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:16.720
God, I want to slap him so bad. I kind of how fucking dare you

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.920
I mean, I guess it doesn't really matter since it's California

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.920
Yeah, I I would love to see how much he knows about Joe George totally

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.420
That's just some fake ass

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:33.360
Like I'm so I look I don't agree with what Trump does and I don't like the way he does it

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:40.560
But listen, I can't support the Democrats cuz I'm an iconoclast. I'm Joe fucking Rogan. You don't know shit

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:46.760
I would have voted Democrat if they got Tulsi Gabbard. Yeah, right fuck off you fucking screw you

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:53.620
So again, I often feel like we're gonna get hit with the DMCA complaint and have like copyright

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.880
Claims put on our episodes big in cyberpunk 2077

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:03.440
All right, people are saying that you have to turn DMCA music off. Otherwise the twitch will kick you off

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:07.340
Oh, no, you'll get kicked off, but we're fine. Oh are we so again?

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:11.780
Thanks for watching and back to this exclusive in-depth Joe Rogan interview

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:16.800
Which is free to air all you can re-upload it. You can clip it out. You can make memes out of it

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:22.200
It's all copyright free the Alex show show and everything we do at info Wars calm

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.680
See, this is the double-edged sword of his desperation for memeing

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:30.680
It is a little bit is that he has to give blanket permission to people like us to be

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:36.240
Easy so I guess we're safe. All right, buddy. Yeah, so that was from a little

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:39.340
commercial that Alex inserted in of course

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:46.600
Of course he did. Why wouldn't he you gotta make money? Yeah, I don't actually even remember what this is about

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.840
This next clip. I doubt they do either. Oh, no now I remember

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:55.200
So they're talking about Joe's dog and how great this golden retriever is. Oh my god

01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:00.960
Is Alex gonna kill his dog on air? I was worried about that. The rifle is right there. I know! He's swinging it around!

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.200
The dog isn't there

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:10.480
But they talk about how great Joe's dog is and the dog smiles and loves Joe and Alex gets mad because he starts thinking

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:16.520
about how like, you know some animal psychologists will say like what you think of as

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.160
happiness in an animal isn't always

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:28.040
Happiness. Right. A smile on a dog isn't necessarily happiness in the same way it is for humans. Alex gets kind of mad about this

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:36.000
That is a microcosm of his relationship to animals is his relationship to people. I don't understand why you don't think me! You're all

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:43.140
You're all nature. None of its nurture. Well, but but that's then but then they say they are up here though

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:50.600
They have souls. They have minds. They have decisions. Just you don't. He's talking about like the elites of psychiatry and what have you.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.160
And it's an ultimate. They're in the lower class. We're in the lower class.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.640
Elitism. What existed before the Germans and then in modern psychiatry and psychology

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:04.400
200 years ago, and so that's what I'm coming at here is it doesn't mean that the things they've created the list

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.240
They've made aren't real human traits

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:12.600
But it's really a cult a gill blocking us from the larger issue because your dog is magic. Your dog does have a soul

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:19.120
It does have an energy. It is smiling. You are interfacing. Dogs are psychic buffers way more psychic than we are

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:25.900
And so I'm saying is your dog is is the example of what humanity is to go towards instead of somebody like Bill Gates

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:30.020
Yeah, we should be less like Bill Gates and more like Rogan's dog. Jesus

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:37.040
Just it's meaningful. It's meaningful stuff. Just scream out. I don't want to learn that

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:43.060
That how dare they say something different than me? Well, like I'm not threatened by

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:48.640
Someone telling me that my cat smiling doesn't mean she's happy. Oh shit. What is it? What does it mean?

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:55.400
I'm not next question. I'm not threatened by the idea that her purring isn't always like showing love or happiness

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:58.960
How can I make it better right and I also don't question

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:03.880
The bond that we have like I'm not tied up in

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:08.860
Nope, if a psychiatrist said that that cat doesn't feel everything you think it's feeling all the time

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:15.520
That's because you don't have a soul. I'm not invested in projecting my feelings on to my pet friend

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:22.660
Yeah, I don't understand why people I don't know. I don't care. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's it's a thing

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:29.420
So Joe has been pretty shitty so far about the idea that people have valid criticism

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:35.180
Criticism right about Alex right right and in this next clip. I think this is like I really resent this

01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:39.220
Listen, Alex, you got to think of what it's like to be a 23 year old kid

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:44.820
Who is friends with a bunch of other 23 year old kids that espouse a very rigid?

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:48.860
Ideology and when someone deviates from this ideology

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:55.580
Ideology and says maybe the guy's not a bad guy. Maybe he had like a psychotic moment. Maybe he had a bad time

01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:59.560
Maybe maybe he believed it because he's seen so much

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.740
Bullshit, he's seen so many lies and maybe went crazy

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:11.460
Maybe you went crazy cuz he's on his own and because nobody wants to stand up and say hey

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:14.060
He's right about a lot of shit. So

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:19.540
He seemed like the the thing that he's saying is like psychotic is like a sandy hook stuff

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:26.940
Yeah, but like what Joe is presenting is this idea that like the only people who are really critiquing Alex or?

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:32.980
23 year olds who are socially uncomfortable with the fear that they have of saying hey

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.580
Maybe Alex is right about something. Yeah, that's

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:40.560
Ridiculous. Yeah. Yeah, that's very frustrating and and angering and

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:48.540
almost suggests a sort of distance from what people really live that could only really come about through a

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:50.540
hundred million dollars

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:58.020
And it's straw man straw man techniques in terms of like this is why people have a problem with you

01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:00.900
It's because all their 23 year old friends are in a rigid

01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:05.980
ideology it's it's crazy how I'm not even going to mention that maybe

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:09.900
People of color or women might have critiques of you. It's actually

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.860
23 year old men who are

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:19.920
Scared hurting their friends feeling. Yeah. Yeah by saying fuck you Alex has all those it's all those non

01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:26.420
alpha men who aren't carrying a gun right now and smoking cigars and whining about how people don't respect

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:32.260
everything that we believe without questioning us like alphas do and the real problem is

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.300
That Alex got left out in the wilderness

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:41.020
That's the real problem even if you're wrong rather about some things

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:44.860
I meant well, you're a human being and your perspective is valuable

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:49.900
And one of the reasons why you were wrong about such things is because you were abandoned

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:56.420
There was so many people that didn't want to hitch their car up to your train because they were scared

01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:59.860
They would get caught in the 9-11 conspiracy in the Bohemian Grove

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:07.980
Conspiracy and the fucking Bilderberg conspiracy. There was so many different things that led people down uncomfortable moments and uncomfortable

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:12.860
Conversations, they didn't want to be a part of it. So they just left you alone and

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.500
when people get

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:19.760
Abandoned by all of the other people around them that may

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:26.060
Possibly have an inkling that you are correct. You start going fucking crazy

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:30.260
Yeah, that look on your face was amazing. I'm so fucking mad

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:35.740
I'm so mad at that this okay. Okay, fine. I get it

01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:40.500
We've all seen Good Will Hunting, you know, it's great to give the pep talk speech

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:45.020
But you know that was that was fucking Matt Damon as like a underappreciate

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:50.700
This is like giving that same pep talk speech to John Wayne Gacy and being like look a lot of people just don't

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:57.860
Understand why you're doing what you're doing man, but they're just not ready to challenge themselves. I I disagree here

01:08:57.860 --> 01:09:01.380
Here's what I think. Mm-hmm. It would be like John Wayne Gacy

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:07.520
I haven't killed all those people. Yes, and then someone his friend being like look, you know

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:12.620
The problem was that you didn't have friends around you telling you not to dress up like a clown

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:17.220
You were abandoned

01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:22.100
Didn't have people around you telling you not to report on Sandy Hook like that

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:28.260
Even though we have I don't know a deposition of Paul Joseph Watson saying I told him not to do this

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:31.420
There was that yeah, this is there was that this is this some bullshit

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:35.580
We were trying to make it not Alex's fault. They had done every bad thing. He's done in his career

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:38.700
These are the people who bitch about

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.300
participation trophies

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:46.260
This is the most like hey look just cuz you failed a million times

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:53.700
Upwards to the tune of millions of dollars now doesn't mean you're not still great. It's participation trophies and personal

01:09:53.700 --> 01:10:01.100
responsibility and ideas like these people who think that's all they keep repeating and over and over and over again and

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:06.340
Here you have like Alex. It's not your fault. People just left you people just people left you on your own

01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:11.480
And that's why you had to say that people were crisis actors who were grieving for their dead family members

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:15.660
yourself starting to think a lot of people's criticisms of

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:21.620
Entitled white men are right on. Yeah, but I'm probably just a 23 year old is worried

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:27.420
It could be that three-year-olds around me that it could be that you're right. Yeah, so when you are

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:33.060
Hearing something like Alex saying that he's not using Joe for exposure

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.060
How would you hear that?

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:39.340
Like a punch to the face and here's the deal

01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:43.520
I'm not using you in this interview, but you're so big and the system

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:48.540
Likes wants to watch what you're doing so I can get messages through when you're on the show

01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:50.860
so one of the things I wanted to say to the left is

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:52.220
I

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:56.040
Don't know about the left the average left person left us cool. I

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:59.620
Hear Alex say I'm not using you

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:06.140
But I know that more people will listen because you're here as him saying I'm using you now

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:11.700
I don't understand how you could be friends with Alex for this long without

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:15.480
Finding out his rhetorical trick of saying I'm not doing

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:22.840
But and then doing the thing yeah, because literally he does that every time Alex's son named his show

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.840
I'm not bragging as a joke

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:32.360
Exactly. I'm not doing this. I'm not using you. I'm doing this means. I'm using you

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:38.860
Yeah, every reason that I then explained. I don't hang out with him real life only on the context of this show

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:46.220
So occasionally yeah, uh and I picked up on that real fast, so I kept this clip in just because it's like

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:48.780
I think it's kind of indicative of

01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:54.500
Some stretches of this episode where it's like what I was talking about earlier. It's like yeah, this is boring

01:11:54.580 --> 01:12:00.380
Yeah, this is just them having a conversation that I don't care about but it goes on

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.700
You ever have a Kopi luat coffee

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:06.780
No, oh my god

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.140
That's

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:13.860
Not even a real razorback though Kopi luat coffee is coffee that comes from a civet

01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:17.860
So the civet eats the coffee bar craps and shits them out

01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:21.860
And then people collect them and clean them up and then sell them

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:27.800
And it makes the best fucking coffee ever when you said about tried it. I've heard of it. It's so good

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.780
It's really good

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:37.500
Like it's it's a cat like a civet is kind of a cat. It's like real close

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:43.320
By the way do you have a photograph of a civet by the way you have a ragdoll catch

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.820
Yeah

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:47.820
Hold on. Let's look at a civet

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:54.900
Now I was trying to stalk you but but but I watched the show a lot today, and I'm going hey

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:59.460
You've got ragdoll catch tell Joe you've got him so I didn't know you had right this week this week

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:03.980
I was smart well. They're really relaxed pretty blue eyes. Yeah, there's your civet

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:08.180
yeah, so that animal shits out coffee beans and

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:16.460
Then it's super expensive. It's called Kopi luat. I've heard of it. Yeah, so is it really good

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:20.340
It's really good Wow

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:26.760
Great I've been on road trip. I've been on road trips with comics before yeah, and there is one

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:32.100
I will remember forever because the two people in the back just started having such a boring

01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:35.780
Conversation while I was driving. I drove so much faster

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:39.260
Just cuz their conversation was boring

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:47.260
That is the worst. I would I would literally stop being friends with people who had that conversation

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:48.420
Yeah, I was listening to that

01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:53.780
And I just sort of whoa there was a couple points and that was one of them where I was just sort of like rubbing

01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:59.940
My temples Wow don't know what's going on. I got guys this this is what this is on purpose

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:01.940
It's gonna stop the global

01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:05.460
You can edit things

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:11.240
Well Joe has a big message that he wants to get across on this episode and that is that we need to get rid of

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.700
tribalism and when he says tribalism

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:18.340
He's talking about the idea of looking at everybody as teams like Democrats Republicans

01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:22.360
We need to get over that and start looking at each other as people who have ideas

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.960
And look at the ideas that each other have and if I have a better idea than your idea

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:32.360
Then my idea will win and you will then have my idea all I hear is I would like people to stop

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:35.040
Criticizing rich white men maybe that could be it

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:42.280
We are dealing with the remnants of a savage past when people kill people with stone

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.600
Axe tools and now we do it with chemtrails and vaccines

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.200
Slow down my point is

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:51.560
Is

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:55.480
We're connected with this idea that we have to

01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:58.160
absolutely have to

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:04.700
Be in opposition with each other. I don't think I'm sure bloods. That's dumb. It's nonsense

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.540
That's the weakness. The weakness is not like

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.920
flip-flopping or

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:16.640
Reconsidering your opinions. The real weakness is the really thinking that people that are just

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:23.280
Marginally different from you in terms of the way they look at things that those people your enemy

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:26.440
We have to stop seeing each other as the enemy, but that's what I want. Just

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:30.120
Talk, do you know who you're talking to?

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:36.800
Alex spends all of his time talking about how his imaginary enemies are like working for the literal devil

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:44.800
Yeah, like this is a fine point that he's making but it's farcical to be making it while sitting next to Alex fucking Jones

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:49.500
Like hey, you know what you should do after this. You should ask him what he thinks about Democrats

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:51.360
What does he think?

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:56.200
He thinks they're all demons. He thinks that they're literally possessed by demons

01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:03.960
Yep. Wow. Yeah Wow. Oh my god. I mean sure it's a it's a it's a fine thought the

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.400
Alex does agree with him

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:09.640
he would like that to be the

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:14.300
Perfect world and it can only come about in an all-white nation

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.820
It seems like that's kind of the tribalism that I would like to Christian. Yeah

01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:27.200
On those tribalism parts that he kind of focuses on maybe those tribalism parts are the worst ones

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:31.280
No, we start with we have to overcome it though as Joe is

01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:37.860
Very repetitively pointing. Thanks. I think the thing that is

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:39.860
most

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.560
Difficult to overcome in our pursuit

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:48.800
For the understanding of the reality of the universe white male hedge money behavior. Oh

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:55.820
That there's a team that's in opposition to you and your beliefs which are righteous and true and good

01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:01.320
But if I don't have tribalism somebody's gonna overtake me so I don't like tribalism as a necessary evil

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:08.640
Like I don't want a government that I need a strong enough government that has limited government to protect me from try radical governments, right? I understand

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:16.220
I think maybe the solution is an understanding of tribalism and then an agreement to never engage in it and

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:20.900
When people do engage in it, you should look at those people as being foolish

01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:25.740
I agree, so we need a lot of good versus bad. Yeah positive versus sin

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:32.800
Look not the Christian cosmology of sin. What is a sin against humanity? I think lying I think being a chicken shit

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:38.120
I think me a coward. Yeah. Yeah, so what's evil Alex?

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.620
I find you guilty of your own sins against humanity

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:46.660
You know what? I love to listen to two dumber people have a

01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:49.680
Conversation that was famous for happening

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:52.680
2,500 years ago

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:54.680
This is the exact... what are we doing?

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:06.220
This is the problem with so much like online based discourse and like the the whole the sort of

01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:10.020
Debates that happen like among people who are self-taught

01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:10.420
Yeah

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:15.480
Like she was good a lot of the times you don't realize that these ideas that you think are so

01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:19.080
Revolutionary are things you might encounter in your first year in college

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:23.900
Yeah, like there is so much past these points that they're getting to where their minds are blown

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:29.060
But also I mean like I would take Rogan like as a good faith actor sure

01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:32.780
Sure, and I would say that okay. Now. This is interesting. Okay now

01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:39.780
There we go Joe you are on the right track buddy

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:44.740
Now what does it mean for you to say that we should disincentivize people to act tribally

01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:50.140
And then if people do begin to act tribally we should look at them as fools. Yes

01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:56.220
it means that how is society organized and what we need to do is

01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:59.140
Give people a fine

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:04.100
For engaging in behavior with groups larger than a thousand wait wait

01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:07.620
So now we have to have a fine for being foolish for being a fool

01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:12.620
This is not enforceable in any way

01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:18.220
And if you tried it would get so out of hand

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:23.260
It would be absolutely used to crack down on vulnerable populations trying to band together

01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:29.360
But they don't think about that because they've never been the vulnerable population getting cracked down on but they do think that they are of course

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:32.380
They guess they're conservatives who are so fucking shadow banned

01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:38.860
You know the reason I used to here's what I used to think that has just been blown away by this very conversation

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:44.580
the reason I thought people who have spent their entire lives studying this type of thing having a

01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:49.260
Conversation and that becoming popular the reason I thought the the thing that blocked that for me

01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:52.220
I thought was that it would be too dry. It would be too

01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:57.460
Boring, you know, but this conversation is more boring than anything I can think of

01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:05.060
Yeah, this is tragically boring and more people are gonna watch that then two people who've spent their entire life studying these questions

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:10.380
Yeah, I have I don't know it's tough for me to say because I guess I'm not a normal person

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:12.940
Necessarily and I am you know, 36

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:18.100
I'm on a different period of my life is maybe the target demographic of Joe Rogan. Sure

01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:21.480
But like 23 year old meatheads, I suppose. Yeah

01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:23.540
Who are afraid of yeah

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:30.440
I think a lot of people think of like college lectures and like academic conversation to be really boring

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:37.640
But this is fucking boring. This is incredibly boring. Yes, and the difference is if you engage with the academic stuff

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:41.440
You probably learn something. It's amazing. You're not gonna learn anything from this

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:45.480
No other than I think Joe's a little bit disappointed in Alex

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:45.720
Yeah

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:50.280
because when when Joe's talking about this need to overcome tribalism and Alex is like

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.480
I need my tribe to fight back against any other it try

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:57.020
Yeah, I think there's a sense of Joe being like you don't get it

01:20:57.020 --> 01:21:03.300
You don't get the higher-level thing that I'm imagining. Yeah granted what he's imagining is a stupid

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:13.220
But he has no idea how to attain you just can't see my flying Pegasus world and it's disappointing to me

01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:14.740
Yeah, no

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:19.820
But despite all that disappointment, I mean the two of them are friends and we can prove it

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:23.980
Well, yeah, like two years later. We shot a video. Yeah during the contested election

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:28.580
Making fun of the bushes. Well you and I dressed up I dressed up like

01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:35.460
See, I just have a junior junior senior. Yeah, and I was in a wheelchair and we

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:38.100
Went running around

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:45.060
Was the capital the capital and we smoked a little weed allegedly every single time these two talk this story comes up

01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:50.520
Wow, which leads me to suspect that maybe there aren't that many memories. Yeah, that kind of suggests maybe

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.140
Maybe

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:54.820
They got high and ran around the capital and masks

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:55.460
You know

01:21:55.460 --> 01:22:00.820
I think that the basis like the stories for any friendship and that you that you share

01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:07.520
Should not be I guess you had to be their stories, you know, because this story is one where I'm like, I

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:11.980
Maybe if I was there it would be funny, but this is no

01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:17.340
I mean, I've seen it they videotaped it cool. I've watched it was still 20 years ago. Yeah. Yeah

01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:20.860
Oh, I mean I you've had experiences like that with friends

01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:27.200
You can extrapolate like how much fun that much sure sure and it was like, you know, 99 2000

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:30.540
It's just you're free, you know, like it's such a different time

01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:35.460
Maybe a few years. Yeah, I

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:43.020
Just think it's kind of depressing. Yeah, I've heard this on other podcasts to like people who only have one story

01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:49.540
Yeah, and every time this guest is on that story comes up. Yes. It's like, huh? Yeah get a new story guys live

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:58.220
Stop talking and live. Yeah, so in this next clip we get again another thing another instance of this

01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:02.620
mentality that Alex has where he wants to be like

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:07.860
Rogan with this like yeah, we need to get rid of all this tribalism stuff, but I also need mine

01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:15.680
Yeah, well, yeah, I don't have a hundred million dollars and and this is this is Alex expressing that like, you know

01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:18.180
His nationalism is basically a cult

01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:22.980
Yeah, but he needs that call well because he imagines that his enemies are also a cult

01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:26.660
Well, and so he needs his call to fight their call. But yeah, I'm

01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:30.140
Creating my own enemy in order to destroy myself

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:35.820
I don't understand what you don't understand and I'm creating my own enemy to justify really fucked up things

01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:41.620
I want exactly we have to use our own nationalism which has failed and has problems and it's cultic

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:47.300
But our cults better than their cult humans organizing cults. It's our nature. I agree. We should transcend it

01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:51.420
You're at that point Joe. I can see up on the mountain. I get where you're going

01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:53.900
I'm just saying well, you're in a crisis though

01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:54.940
It's like the lower brain

01:23:54.940 --> 01:24:00.980
It is the nationalist called a free market money and family and God and runs and everything

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:05.780
It's gonna counter the chai comms where man you work 18 hours a day if you complain your ass is dead

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:08.500
yeah, because the global model is communist China and

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:11.800
All I'm saying is they're taking over. So what do we do about that?

01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:21.620
Good response Joe first of all, whenever you're in a situation where you're coming at me

01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:24.740
for global advice

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:31.860
We got real problems. I think there's a humility in Joe's response. I appreciate that, you know, like come on

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:35.900
Why the fuck are you asking me for a solution now? Unfortunately?

01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:41.780
He does continue and give an idea. Well, I mean he can't not and he should have stopped it

01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:44.160
You shouldn't ask me because this is dumb

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:48.640
But honestly, I do look at it like when you say like what do we do about it?

01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:52.740
If you could wave a magic wand

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:58.340
You'd make them all do mushrooms all of them. Just all of them

01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:03.300
Everybody anybody in a position of power anybody locked into an ideology

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:11.060
Anybody who believes nonsense anybody who believes things that they know aren't true clean

01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:16.820
But they'll fight for them. Do you know people that know that the things they believe aren't true? How dare you?

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:19.940
They'll get angry you and how dare you there's a weird

01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:27.180
How fucking dare you that if more people took hallucinogens they would but but then someone go crazy someone go crazy

01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:34.260
Yeah, yeah, some kids break their legs. You see like an Islamic leader. You can tell they've never taken it. What? Wow

01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:39.820
What? Wow, what? Yeah, no, no Muslims have ever tripped or something

01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:46.740
This is I mean, this is embarrassing. That's spectacular. This is like Joe Rogan's like 50 no

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:51.420
No, no, he is late 40s. He did somebody's got to be true

01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:59.300
He is something I never thought anyone could do which is he took the four ways to learn and really condensed it still further

01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:05.660
Down one one way fungus mushrooms. Yeah. All right. All right. So here's how we solve Israel, Palestine

01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:10.780
He's gonna be like great. That's gotta be like a joke. It's gotta be his brand. Yeah

01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:18.380
I mean, yeah, you could really know. No, he's just doing like I imagine if your job is to essentially be high all the time

01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:22.140
You know, yeah, you've got to lean into it, you know

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:27.500
Benson didn't stop doing weed jokes just cuz he got to 50 plus right, you know

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:32.500
I've done mushrooms and it is a fun experience, you know, and under the right circumstances

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:37.180
Sure. I also know a lot of shitheads who've done a lot of mushrooms. Yes

01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:43.940
It doesn't it they are all for universal basic income. I don't know if they are it does not solve anything

01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:49.260
It's not a miracle cure. No, it's not like oh if you're living in a contradiction you take mushrooms. It's

01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:55.580
That's how it always works. Kind of hippie-dippie bullshit is every story that I've ever heard about

01:26:56.300 --> 01:27:04.260
Hallucinogenics has been oh man. It's straightened out my political philosophy. Huh? That's what it did made sure all those

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:09.300
Inconsistencies I had in my head just went away resolved everything

01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:16.980
Hey, what was the thing that I thought most on my trip was just like a progressive tax policy does work as intended

01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:22.880
I expect this like in a bong circle with a guy coming out of the mouth of someone wearing like

01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:25.460
blown glass necklace on a

01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:32.140
Braid, you know, that's what I expect. I don't expect this out of a hundred million mayor

01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:35.580
Yeah, yeah, who's almost 50 she's have some dignity

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:41.420
What he didn't get to be a hundred millionaire by having dignity or learning things

01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:44.660
He got to a hundred million by being a guy who took shrooms

01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:57.060
Especially the people who believe things that aren't true like the person I'm sitting right next to why do we always make the people most?

01:27:57.060 --> 01:28:02.460
Deserving as of a slap to the face of the most famous and rich people available and good at martial arts

01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:10.040
This next clip Alex reveals that he's probably taken some hallucinogens

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:17.060
He might have even done acid with Joey be a watch out or he got dosed by Joey Diaz and pissed his pants one

01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:22.380
Where the other one was that you have you invited me to in Houston like eight nine years ago with Joey Diaz

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:24.840
Well, didn't you guys allegedly do acid allegedly?

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:26.840
Well

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.560
No, let's go back Joey Diaz

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.340
Joey Diaz hands me a cookie in Houston

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.500
Couldn't get out of the chair

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.500
I'm sitting I'm watching the whole day

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:58.420
That's where God did we go to dinner that night we did yeah, I was like crawling around the ground and you couldn't

01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:03.540
Pillar of Christianity

01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:09.760
Destroyer of globalists. Yep. I who got dosed by Joey Diaz and pissed his pants at a UFC fight

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:12.000
Alex Jones

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:16.320
See now that's where I would like to be

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:22.360
I want to see Joey Diaz roast Alex while he's tripping. That would be hilarious

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:28.700
I can't I can't provide that while he's tripping but there was a time like way back when Joey Diaz came to

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:33.960
Infowars Studios with Rogan. I did not know that. Yeah, we can cover that in a future episode

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:40.320
Like a good one. I like a good DS. It's really tough though because he's screaming at Alex. Well, that sounds right

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:44.400
It's something that I've always thought about like, yeah, maybe we'll do that for an episode

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:50.040
But I remember way back. I tried to prepare it and it was just like holy shit. This is incoherent

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.920
But maybe

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:56.560
My pants

01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:04.440
I dosed Alex with way too much THC and he smells like piss

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:17.440
Anyway in this next clip Joe, this is this is another instance where I take him to task

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:24.520
I think that this is him revealing what his goals were with having Alex on his podcast

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:27.840
Mm-hmm, and I would say that this is not what he does

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:30.960
One of the goals that and this is real

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:34.840
one of the goals that what I wanted to achieve is

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:41.680
To have people consider that there's people that have wildly different ideas that you do that may be good guys

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:47.960
so there's maybe these people that have ideas of you and I wanted them to consider that maybe

01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:54.680
That's a good guy. And if you and Alex were hanging out with me and Eddie Bravo

01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:59.480
And we were all in a room together. We would be fucking laughing. We would be laughing hard

01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:04.400
We'd be having a lot of fun. We'd be it would be fun. It'd be ridiculous

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:10.020
And if you're not in that room, it's easy to judge. Well, guess what guess who's not in that room

01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:14.960
The millions of people who are watching. Yeah, you're you're saying like oh, yeah

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:20.080
I just wanted to show that it's a fun experience to hang out with Alex Jones. Mm-hmm. But meanwhile

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:24.200
The people who are watching aren't gonna have that fun experience

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:30.200
What they are going to see is me fumble and accidentally validate all of the lies that he's trying to disseminate

01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:31.640
Yeah, and hey, man

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:36.760
Like I don't know I was Paul pot a fun guy to drink with could you have done a podcast with him?

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:40.720
Like I know that's probably an extreme example, but like yeah, okay

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:47.520
Yeah, you can get along with people who are like gerbils. Yeah fun. I don't know. I don't know

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:50.760
Let's let's hope we never find out don't I don't think so

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:55.600
I just don't think he was that kind of guy probably not but you know, what is a real Sudoku guy?

01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:00.800
He wasn't really a hangout Joe is basically saying that his goal was to launder Alex

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:05.200
To his audience by virtue of seeing how how much fun we can hang out with

01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:12.520
Furthermore. Hey, fuck you. How about fuck you you would have fun if you were in a room with me and Alex Jones and Eddie Bravo

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:16.960
What if you were a fucking Muslim woman not much not much fun

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:20.960
No to have the guy across from you who is saying shit like I want you to die

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:26.040
Yeah a trans person. What if you were not a white guy? Yeah, huh? Well Eddie's a

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:31.540
Person of color. Okay. Anyway, look, here's what I would say Eddie's Eddie

01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:33.940
Here's what I would say

01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:37.060
If this was your goal

01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:43.540
Then you have a responsibility to not allow Alex to talk about anything conspiracy related anything political on your show

01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:50.140
Yep, if your goal was just to talk about how fun Alex is you guys have an interview and a talk?

01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:55.460
We get drunk and talk about college football and high school and like talk about that stuff

01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:57.660
Yeah, you do not talk about the globalists

01:32:57.660 --> 01:33:04.420
You don't talk about his bullshit because then that intersects with where his misinformation is and you especially don't turn it into a call back

01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:10.260
No, you can always go back to and say hey look we had him on our show and he checked out

01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:15.060
Mm-hmm. So if you if you think something's wrong, I'll tell you he checked out when I looked at you

01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:18.660
It's a perfect case of wanting to play both games at the same time

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:24.020
yeah, it's like I wanted to show the world that you were fun by getting fucked up with you and

01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:27.100
and tacitly supporting your conspiracies

01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:28.580
like that's not that's not

01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:33.180
You can't pretend that you're fact-checking him and showing that he's fun because you're doing neither

01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:38.780
It's almost as though he grew up kind of choosing the path of least resistance

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:44.060
You know to just kind of get along with everybody around him and just kind of not make

01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:48.020
Your identity that could be how you form your identity damn

01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:54.020
So I will say that Joe is not comfortable with how much Alex wants to talk about how famous he is

01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:56.180
What is it like to be?

01:33:56.180 --> 01:34:01.560
You know the the main Oracle because you can say like, you know, Jimmy Carson was this guy

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:04.800
I mean older Cronkite was that guy you're kind of that fuse together on a first

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:08.180
You have the audience are bigger when every other media has been atomized

01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:11.900
But in force is a close second or whatever, but this matters not about that

01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:16.460
You're in the position of being the Oracle does that like an Oracle Adelphi right now?

01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:24.100
Well, you're definitely not helping me with your weird description of what I do cuz it's not accurate nor is it respectful

01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:30.460
It's ridiculous. He's a little bit more playful when he's saying it's it sounded like he was actually saying that's disrespect

01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:38.100
But he is uncomfortable and he should be that's fucking weird

01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:42.260
yeah, I would not be comfortable with that Joe interviews people and has

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:46.340
In formal conversations that go too long and yeah

01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:50.500
You're the Oracle of Delphi. Yeah, you're basically Walter Cronkite and

01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:53.060
Jimmy Carson Oh

01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:57.060
Jimmy Carson. Oh, man. He had some of those great jokes

01:34:57.060 --> 01:35:02.580
He used to wear a where a turban Joe Rogan actually was on Jimmy Carson. He got waved over to the love seat

01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:08.300
Made his career overnight success

01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:11.180
Oh, we got in at the store. Yeah

01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:16.020
Oh

01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:17.620
Jimmy Carson

01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:22.740
So one of the things that I think was a big point that I made early on in our podcast

01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:28.540
And I maybe make it less now because I don't like him nearly as much as I used to yeah

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:32.580
Not to say that I used to like Alex, but I certainly dislike him more. Yes. Yes

01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:39.860
I actively dislike him a lot more. Yeah, but one thing that I still do believe but I think is probably less important

01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:45.220
Is that the role that he used to fill is kind of a good role in society?

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:53.820
The kind of guy who will freak you out and maybe it's your brother's friend or something who tells you about the CIA

01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:59.700
Or whatever sure. Sure. Sure. That is a voice that there is a place for in society

01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:06.140
Mm-hmm a conspiracy theorist who you know doesn't behave the way that Alex does the guy who's not also

01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:13.180
Who can't hurt anybody a complete racist bigot monster and semi throwing around demon shit all the time

01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:18.220
You know somebody without malice. Yeah. Yeah, there is a place for that

01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:22.740
Yeah, and I think Joe like he touches on like why?

01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:28.780
Alex has anything and it's because there was a place that he fit in before

01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:35.460
You've taught me a lot of things and this is very important. Like like I said earlier on the show about

01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:38.580
people using

01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:40.780
other

01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:43.180
Departments or other

01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:46.660
law enforcement or whatever to start smashing

01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:53.100
Polite protests and turning them into violent protests like until you showed me all that stuff about agent provocateurs

01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:58.340
I really had no idea that anybody would ever think like that. I had this naive perspective

01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:03.780
I think a lot of people have that people that are in government and people that are in

01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:09.180
Leadership they really just want the best for the citizens

01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:13.260
So there is there is a role that can be filled of like

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:16.220
Discussing these kinds of topics. They often aren't

01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:21.540
necessarily front and center sure there there's a value to that

01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:27.460
Yeah, but unfortunately the double-edge of this clip is it so clearly demonstrates

01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:30.100
Why what Alex is doing nowadays is useless. Yeah

01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:36.780
Like yes in the 90s Alex woke you up to the idea of agent provocateurs, right?

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:40.820
That is his niche, right? That's what he should be right? He

01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:47.020
Strayed too far and ended up being a guy who can shift into psychic spaces

01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:51.940
And his lore is a little too complicated now his skill set is absurd

01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:56.300
Yeah, he's a show that went on too long. He's ending the way Game of Thrones did

01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:59.860
I think he's a victim of his own success. Yeah, right like he

01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:06.700
Whatever the reason he got like millions of dollars and ended up in that flashy ass studio

01:38:06.700 --> 01:38:11.340
Mm-hmm. It's the detriment of his career. Like he could probably have lived out a pretty

01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:13.500
successful

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:18.340
Making a good living being a conspiracy theory talk-show host

01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:23.340
But he got too big for his britches and now this is embarrassing. No comedians are funnier when they're on the bus

01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:27.060
I never I've never dreamt of being like famous

01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:32.700
I've always just wanted to be a comic who lived his life as like a comic like I want to live comic life

01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:34.700
I don't want to make a comic show

01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:39.940
I want to live comic life. I don't want millions. I don't I definitely don't want a hundred million enough. Yeah

01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:43.020
Yeah, having too much might end up being

01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:46.540
It might make you unable to do

01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:47.960
Whatever it is

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:53.700
You need to do because once you start going down this road and you start worrying about like pill sales

01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:58.540
And all this you start to think about like what are the things that I'm doing that gets the most attention?

01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:05.560
For sure and then you know, it's no longer. Hey, here's a boring conversation about the reality of

01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:11.020
Agent provocateurs and what you need to know about the history of this tactic, right?

01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:15.140
It now becomes everybody is pretending that they have relatives who have died

01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:19.200
Yeah, because it's exciting because it excites the internet and it gets a traffic

01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:26.540
Yeah, because your incentive is no longer to educate or whatever if that was his attention at the beginning

01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:32.500
I guess it's it's now a marketing base. Yeah, that's I mean, it's it's you know

01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:39.740
the idea of not trying to be a millionaire and doing every single possible step you can take to get there is a

01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:47.400
Radical socialist commie bullshit Dan and you're on my list fair enough. So whereas Alex

01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:53.340
30 years ago turned Joe on to agent provocateurs

01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:58.540
This is what he does now. I'm in Arizona three weeks ago. I got a call from the White House

01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:03.900
High level high level. Well, I mean, you know a Trump son

01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:09.380
Secret, I'll just say it's all about name dropping too late. Oh you need to look into

01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:14.940
Dominion and communist China and Switzerland all the stuff

01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:19.620
We'll call this guy. This guy calls me up from like this big company

01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:24.300
He tells me all this stuff. And so I hire a company look at it. We get all the SEC documents

01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:26.260
They're on him forwards all the news today

01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:28.740
And but this is I asked him I said

01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:32.800
Why are you telling me this and they all we've chosen you as the conduit?

01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:36.820
I'm almost like is that to discredit it because they've said I'm just right

01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:42.780
That's the thing like they can do that with someone so he that's full of shit that he just took that from

01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:46.360
Q and on yeah Twitter accounts and stuff. That was just a

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:53.940
The conspiracy that he he laundered but it's interesting there at the end when he's talking about like are they doing this to discredit me?

01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:59.900
Yeah, that moment of self-reflection was very strange. Why would Trump's son do that?

01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:03.060
You forgot that you said that he was your source. Yeah

01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:08.420
It does make sense if you think that they're trying to discredit

01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:14.620
He's just lying and telling these intriguing stories to Joe to keep his attention. Yeah, and he just keeps lying

01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:17.300
What are the what's the percentage of people that vote?

01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:24.660
Usually it's about 60% in a national election about 49% in an off-year election up down to 40

01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:31.100
But with the whole metric with Trump they had a overturn of about 90% Democrat how many percent Republican turn on?

01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:34.100
Yeah, how many what they had 9% Democrat turn 90?

01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:40.580
Never has been statistically fake. It's never happened. It's a 90% fraud proof though. They just used all Democrat voters, right?

01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:42.580
But do you know that for a fact?

01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:45.420
Yes, they had like 87% of Democrats audio

01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:50.140
In the 2020 election there was a 66.7% voter turnout

01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:56.640
Alex is just making shit up and saying it confidently which allows him to lie to Joe's face and not get called on it

01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:02.400
Because Joe is attached to the messenger and Alex knows that he's exploiting it

01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:08.100
Yeah, but the end goal is attention. The end goal is attention

01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:14.500
He lies to Joe in order to disseminate this information and because Joe doesn't have the wherewithal to push back on it

01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:17.060
Be like fuck yourself. There's no way there was a 90%

01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:20.380
Democrat turnout what the fuck are you talking about?

01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:24.500
Because he doesn't have that or maybe he doesn't want to cause conflict or whatever

01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:29.220
Whatever reason these talking points end up being laundered to Joe's audience

01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:36.300
Yep, if people look up to Joe and they respect him he's sitting there and he's allowing this point to stand tacit endorsement

01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:41.540
Yeah, exactly. But again, the goal is attention and you can see that very clearly

01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:43.740
in this clip

01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:49.340
Imagine being like the hot chick back in like 1963 the cum dump

01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:56.620
Well, let's look at it in a respectful way Alex the hot chick Christ back in 62

01:42:57.340 --> 01:43:04.660
When there wasn't that many of them, you know, there wasn't no Instagram models Marilyn cum dump or uh, how dare you?

01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:06.660
You keep saying that

01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:14.700
The main goal there is let me on what's that? This is like the mean goal is beyond the mean gold, okay

01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:17.980
Well, that's the cringiest shit

01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:24.740
I've ever heard just he's so tickled by the idea that him saying cum dump is gonna be mean gold

01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:31.900
Well, oh they're gonna be this so I can't think of it. I don't want you to play this on our show

01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:35.100
It's really discussed. It's disgusting. Yeah. Oh

01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:41.880
There's two different kinds of disgusting. There's the obvious disgusting. Oh, yeah, and then there's the disgusting of like

01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:43.900
how

01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:47.980
Transparently pathetic is this like how badly you want someone to make a meme?

01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:53.860
Yeah out of you so much to make a meme of all the times. He's desperately begging to have memes made. Okay

01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:56.420
Yeah, like cuz that's the reality of this

01:43:56.420 --> 01:44:03.780
It's it's everything that he's saying that's like kind of gross and offensive is then tagged with I'm trying to get the memes going

01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:05.780
Yeah, so sad

01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:11.500
Also sad Alex makes a claim about something that Bill Gates said on Japanese TV

01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:15.740
Mm-hmm, and because they're doing this and then putting it out later

01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:18.660
Alex is able to drop in proof

01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:22.660
Okay of his claim. All right, which they do about four or five times

01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:27.340
None of it proves anything, but this is the most egregious example. Okay, this is

01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:33.460
Outrageous and Joe if you're listening, which I know you're not I would I would say listen to this

01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:37.820
Listen to the proof that Alex tagged on he had all the time in the world to find

01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:42.860
Edit it later. This is it back in this is what he chose. This is your guy

01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:47.940
No, he's Bill Gates said. Oh, don't worry. The Japanese TV goes this is gonna kill people

01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:50.700
He goes it's for the he goes it's for other countries now, you know

01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:55.820
The printer goes on why I don't know if exactly what you said is representative

01:44:57.460 --> 01:44:59.820
Yeah, how many times have I told you a

01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:02.020
lot

01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:05.620
But when you go down crazy town was on Japanese, you know, I don't have a map

01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:12.460
He said it more more defended. He goes. Yes, don't Japanese even they go, you know vaccine cause damage

01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:16.500
Oh people are like you about he's this man. You claim you want to be popular he goes

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:23.820
Japan China the United States are not the target. We have special vaccines for other countries. He goes. Oh, yes

01:45:23.820 --> 01:45:25.820
Oh, I mean it was like

01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:31.820
He said the deal. Yeah, do I see that? Can you show me that on this? I gotta pee again

01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:34.520
I don't think of this. I'll find it. We'll do it right now

01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:42.860
I'd say it's an ironic if you take somebody who's doing their best to get the world ready and you know putting in my case

01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:49.780
millions of dollars into these tools for infectious diseases and really trying to solve

01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:56.180
Broadly infectious diseases including those that can cause pandemics, but that you know

01:45:56.700 --> 01:46:03.820
We're in a crazy situation. So there's going to be crazy rumors. I hope whether it's individuals or

01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:11.380
Countries then some ways that shows us how interdependent we are that to stop a a global pandemic

01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:18.900
we need to find whoever's the best whatever the best vaccine construct are the best drugs and we need to make it

01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:23.060
Without just focusing on one country. We need to make it for the entire world

01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:30.840
Including for countries that don't have the resources to pay for vaccine research or vaccine factories

01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:33.020
You know, they're actually

01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:38.700
Many ways should be the priority for what we do. That's the whole clip that Alex plays

01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:45.780
He played that clip to prove that Bill Gates went on Japanese TV and said Japan China US you guys get a different vaccine

01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:51.000
I really feel like that proved the opposite of what he was saying. It certainly didn't prove anything. It didn't prove anything

01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:51.540
No

01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:57.580
it kind of proved that Bill didn't say that it kind of proves that Alex makes shit up or he has such a

01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:04.220
Flimsy grasp on reality that he hears that clip and that's what he thinks Bill Gates is saying

01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:07.100
He has to believe that that's like he's so smart

01:47:07.100 --> 01:47:11.980
He's reading him between the lines. I would assume that that's the most generous thing that makes sense

01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:17.260
Yes, because that literally says everyone should get the vaccine and we should focus on countries who can't make it for themselves

01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:22.660
Yeah, they should be a priority. Yeah, because it is also a global issue as opposed to yeah

01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:26.660
one country's problem to solve yeah, I don't like I

01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:32.480
Like to say I don't get it. I don't understand but like there are there are a limited number of

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:38.240
Insertions. Yeah. Yeah. One is Alex is intentionally misleading. Mm-hmm

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:45.560
The second is he is a consumer of bullshit news sites. Yeah, and he thinks he's never watched the clip

01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:49.240
He just has read a headline about it from National File or whatever

01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:55.920
And he thinks that's what it said or he watched it and that's what he interpreted it as and it's completely

01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:00.400
erroneous putting it in later, it's so it's so

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:05.760
Sad. Confusing? It's not confusing. Why would you do that? You know, I don't know

01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:06.060
I mean

01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:07.200
I think that there are

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:14.240
Some words that you can say that sound very similar sure and depending on what you think the word is is what you will hear

01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:21.440
That could be I think that Alex would probably assume that he's implanted the idea that that's what Bill Gates was saying

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:24.640
Yeah, so if you hear that that's how if you think Alex knows shit

01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:29.360
That's all you'll be primed for the correct interpretation of his so that's what I assume

01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.360
he thinks it's almost like a

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:33.760
fucking gaslighting

01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:40.400
Three-pointer, you know, it's like I'm going to tell you what you're about to hear doesn't say what you're about to hear

01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:47.160
Yeah, or you just think people just like not really pay attention. Yeah, that's probably like oh, there's he played a clip of Bill Gates

01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:50.720
It must have said Rogan's in the bathroom. I'll skip this part

01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:58.040
Listen Rogan's fans are the meatheads and the potheads like, you know, you can trick him. That's fair. That is fair

01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:03.760
That is fair. So once again Joe takes issue with people who critique his podcast

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:08.440
Interview with Alex strange and this one is also not a good point

01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:10.800
Well, there was a lot of people that got tricked

01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:16.480
They got tricked into thinking that the podcast was something other than what it was and they they read some

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:23.880
Someone else's description and more people did that then listen cuz well, you know, we did three hours plus right?

01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:30.660
How many how many did you do 20 or something like that? I'm crazy. There's no way they listened

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:37.960
There's someone they don't like for three hours and 20 minutes. Like why would they do that? Yeah, why would we do that?

01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:45.520
All right, Joe, that's a personal insult yeah that that one that is that hurts at all

01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:47.640
personal

01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:51.920
That is not abroad. These liberals are doing that's you specifically Dan

01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:53.520
Why

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:55.960
What's most tragic about that is I don't have a good answer

01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:00.680
Why would people listen to hours of someone they hate

01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:04.880
Mmm, that's a good question

01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:08.120
That's a good question. Also, you just described my job

01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:14.220
Don't you dare say 20 hours like oh, look at how much work we did screw you

01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:17.640
We put more time in talking about you dudes talk

01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:24.480
Yeah, but I mean I I do understand that deflection of like it was really long people couldn't have possibly listened to it

01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:29.380
I thought it was shit. Sure and like no, I mean, I'm more primed to listen to something that I think is shit

01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:31.380
Yeah, that's something that is

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:37.960
Bad like this was way more painful than Joe's episode totally and granted him. This is four hours

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:39.240
I was three and a half or whatever

01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:42.840
But like Alex was hot dogging on Joe's show

01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:49.800
Which at least makes some kind of an entertainment value and Joe knows that this is his platform and he has to have some

01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:57.000
Semblance of a shrine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and so like those dynamics played out on Joe's show, which made it a little bit more of

01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:01.320
Interesting. Yeah than this which is long stretches of

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.400
Nothing. No, this is two dudes and Alex being like you're so famous

01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:09.700
This is a two person make a mean is it a two-person smoke circle?

01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:14.960
And that's the worst to possibly be in Alex's how it doesn't have the showmanship chops

01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:21.460
To carry this as like a show so being on Alex's turf is a problem

01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:26.720
Hmm Joe is not as good as like when he's a guest

01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:32.480
yeah, as he is when he's on his own show because he'll just talk about how he ate or drank some coffee that a

01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:39.320
Shit it out. Do you get it? Isn't that gross? But it's good. How can that be? Yeah

01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:45.460
Yeah, I I just hmm. I feel like this must have been an apology like I something

01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:47.460
I feel like this has to be a thing where

01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:50.720
Rogan said you can't come on my yeah. Yeah

01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:57.520
I'll go on your place. Yeah, but I won't be on your actual show. We'll just get drunk and record something

01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:02.320
Yeah, I feel like it has to be something like that some kind of olive branch. Yeah, I don't know

01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:07.200
It's a real bummer. There is no point for this to exist other than for them to try and get attention

01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:12.160
Yeah, it's absurd unlike wild mountain time which exists only for itself to sure

01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:19.760
So we have one last clip and it's Alex really summing things up well, and I think Joe nails it all right well

01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:23.680
I've been on there 27 years and Joe Rogan. I want to thank you for everything

01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:30.280
I want to say this is the best four hours. I ever spent. Thank you so much. That's what's outrageous outrageous about this world

01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:33.280
That's what's outrageous. What is it this could be your best show?

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:40.000
This was nonsense. It is nonsense. Yeah, that's fair. Yeah. Yeah, I like ideas man

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:47.440
I do I like ideas. That's why I like listening to things that I don't agree with I like listening to Alex Jones because I like

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:52.700
Finding I first of all I mean he says stupid things like Alex with guns and shit great

01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:55.720
There are certain things that just wouldn't normally come up in

01:52:56.300 --> 01:53:01.640
Conversations of people I enjoy and I find interesting sure podcast that I would listen to for pleasure

01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:08.520
Certainly a lot of those things wouldn't be overlapping with Alex, right? That's why I listen to stuff like project Camelot

01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:10.520
Hmm, I like ideas yeah

01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:17.740
Weirdest and weirdest ideas that you can possibly get let's fly in the face of danger and see if something might be true

01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:23.160
What if you what if one thing is true Dan just like Joe was saying yeah?

01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:27.160
Just because he's lied a million times doesn't mean you won't find that one grain of gold

01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:32.560
I didn't know about that civic coffee. Yeah, there we go. We did it outside of that. I don't think there was any ideas

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:36.640
That were interesting that were presented on this show. I think it was a disaster. I think it was stupid

01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:38.360
I

01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:44.800
Just I I here's a thought that I have never been able to escape ever since I was like really really young

01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:51.800
It's helped me so far if like whenever I was like 10 years old I remember hearing

01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:53.880
All of my friends have this

01:53:53.880 --> 01:54:01.080
Conversation and I remember being in the middle of it talking about it and I remember thinking there's no possible way that ten-year-olds in

01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:04.520
1990 blue are

01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:09.240
Having a new or interesting thought so if I am having a conversation

01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:15.340
Think for a second did somebody have this conversation several thousand years ago, and then maybe just read

01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:22.160
Maybe read instead of being like so here's what I think about the universe and what we should do is we should give everybody

01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:24.160
But you know like we got

01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:29.560
Tribalism and we got to do shrooms and like hey, maybe somebody's fucking thought about it before. Yeah

01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:34.200
Yeah, that is that is a perspective that it's important to have. Yeah, I do agree with you on that

01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:36.680
I think that exploring ideas

01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:41.360
Conversationally is a fun pastime and I think that that's what what a lot of spring

01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:43.880
Do in college sure

01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:49.240
And I think that it's what people do socially. I think it's a fun thing to do with friends totally

01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:51.240
I don't know if it's always

01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:57.960
Productive. I certainly know from listening to this that it's not entertaining. Yes. That's a good one. I don't know. I

01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:03.880
Come away with this. I tried to like really distill down like the points

01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:08.280
Mm-hmm that run through this because there are trends and all I could come up with are

01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:16.100
Left versus right tribalism sure nonsense. Yeah, that seems to be a thing that Joe really wants to talk about all about interpretation

01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:22.780
There's no possible way that the somebody could be correct. You got to overcome tribalism Joe really wants to point that out

01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:28.400
Alex wants to talk about how famous Joe is. Mm-hmm and how great it is that he's on Spotify

01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:36.360
And then Alex just is too overt and too obvious about his wanting to be a nation. Yeah, it's just it's it's tragic

01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:37.680
it's it's

01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:42.800
Like I keep saying it's cringe-worthy, but that's the only thing that's the only way I can describe it. Yeah, it's

01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:49.960
Exposing his is vulnerable underbelly of desperation. I mean, what's what's wild to me is

01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:53.260
Ostensibly, these are two professional

01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:55.800
broadcasters

01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:01.880
How can you have this boring of a conversation when you've been doing this or some?

01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:07.960
facsimile of this job this very job that you are doing for 20 or 30 years and you come up with

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:13.280
This and this is what you've got and one of the people is the Jimmy Carson of our time

01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:19.840
Jimmy Carson of our times man, you're wasting it. The other one's a close second. Yeah, you are no Ed McMahon, sir

01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:24.020
No, yeah, so there you go folks. You got it. Yeah, there it is

01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:27.680
You got stuff like everybody should do shrooms. Yep

01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:32.600
I think I might have also only decided to do this episode because I came up with the title for it long in advance

01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:35.360
And I was fourth try not a charm nice

01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:37.160
I

01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:38.240
Stuck

01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:44.720
But we'll be back on Monday with a discussion of whether or not Alex moved to DC and is living in a tenement camp

01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:46.360
Let's hope he is

01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:50.720
Who fingers crossed? Yeah, that'll be good news. We'll be back then but tell them Jordan we have a website

01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:53.080
We do have a website. It's knowledgefight.com. You bet it is

01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:55.720
We're also on Twitter. We are on Twitter

01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:29.880
