It's time to pray.

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,920
I have great respect for knowledge fight.

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Riddle her.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Riddle her.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Riddle her.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I need money.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Riddle her.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Riddle her.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Riddle her.

Andy and Kansas.

Andy and Kansas.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Stop it.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Andy and Kansas.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Andy and Kansas.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000

You're on the air.

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Thanks for holding us.

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hello, Alex.

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm a first time caller.

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm a huge fan.

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000

Hey, everybody.

36
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

37
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm Dan.

38
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm Jordan.

39
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We're a couple dudes.

40
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We like to sit around, take novelty beverages, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

41
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

42
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Jordan.

43
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Dan.

44
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Jordan.

45
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Quick question for you.

46
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What's up?

47
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What's your bright spot today?

48
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
My bright spot today is cereals.

49
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay.

50
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I have gone...

51
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Like the old radio cereals?

52
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Like the shadow?

53
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Like the...

54
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I wish that was what I was saying.

55
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No, I'm talking about breakfasts.

56
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh.

57
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,920
I mentioned to you that I have been exploring the world of ordering groceries for the sake

58
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
of safety.

59
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,920
COVID.

60
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,600
And one of the things that has led me to do is more browsing than maybe I'm used to at

61
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
a grocery store.

62
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Sure.

63
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Sure.

64
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,600
I kind of get in and get out at a grocery store, generally.

65
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Absolutely.

66
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,880
I kind of know what I'm looking for, and I don't eat that many different foods.

67
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,480
Wearing blinders at the grocery store.

68
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,480
Go to the frozen pizza section, kachunk, kachunk.

69
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
And go home.

70
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
Yes.

71
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
I'm browsing through.

72
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,400
I've noticed that there are a number of cereals now that really excite me, but also offend

73
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
me.

74
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Okay.

75
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
All right.

76
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
All right.

77
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,200
These are the cereals where everybody is playing each other's game.

78
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Okay.

79
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,400
Everyone is in each other's lanes, and I don't know what's going on.

80
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, do you mean like Kellogg's Rice Krispies will suddenly have like a peanut butter ball

81
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
version?

82
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes.

83
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes.

84
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And you're like, no, no, that's Reese's Puffs.

85
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You stay the fuck out of here, Rice Krispies.

86
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,320
And you have like Fruit Loops with marshmallows.

87
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,800
Yeah, and you're wrong.

88
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
You're working Lucky Chimes side of the street.

89
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,120
What are you doing here?

90
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
Yes.

91
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

92
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,280
And it's weird because when I was a kid, I probably would have loved this.

93
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
Oh, gone ape shit.

94
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,160
Yeah, but now as a 36-year-old man, I'm looking at this and I'm like, God, I gotta try it,

95
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
but I don't want to.

96
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,560
No, it's the worst.

97
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,200
Everybody's fighting on a corner war.

98
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
It's the drug war all over again.

99
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,880
One thing I was thinking about doing, but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to pull

100
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,820
it off because I don't know if I'll actually be able to get all of them.

101
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,280
And I don't know how many of these hybrids there are, but it seems like there's a bunch.

102
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,200
I was thinking about trying to get a bunch and seeing who steals other people's gimmicks

103
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
best.

104
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Okay.

105
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,600
All right.

106
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Does Frosted Flakes, is that improved with marshmallows?

107
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
I don't know how it would work.

108
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,120
I'll tell you, the Chocolate Frosted Flakes, I tried those, absolutely disgusting.

109
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,280
They're delicious for the first three bites and then you're like, I'm not four years

110
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,240
old anymore, so this much sugar is going to kill me.

111
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Yeah.

112
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
I'm going to go with a no.

113
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,040
I think that there's probably a lot of that in what I would find.

114
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:35,000
I did get the Lucky Charms, but with the regular pieces that aren't marshmallows are like

115
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
honey.

116
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, were those good?

117
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No.

118
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,360
Kind of just like, I like regular Lucky Charms.

119
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
They're good.

120
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
They're magically delicious.

121
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,640
I do like how many people are trying new stuff, whatever.

122
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,440
It's like, guys, I have been with Lucky Charms for four, it's like I've been smoking Newport

123
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,640
since I was nine years old and you guys are going to come up with some bullshit.

124
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,300
Like the camel crush, the first time the camel crush happened, I'm like, this is an affront

125
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,300
against God.

126
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,000
How dare you combine these two flavors?

127
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's wrong.

128
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But then.

129
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
They're great.

130
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah.

131
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So maybe you should try all these series.

132
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, I know you should.

133
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So what about you?

134
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,480
The next spot, Dan, is The Avalanche has released a new album.

135
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,400
The Avalanche has released two albums in one decade, Dan.

136
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
That's insane.

137
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Below in your mind, isn't it?

138
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,880
Yeah, I was like, wow, 15 years between Since I Left You and whatever they came out with

139
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
second.

140
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Yeah, Wildflower.

141
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Wow.

143
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,880
Yeah, yeah.

144
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,920
And then just now, We Will Always Love You released Friday, absolutely fantastic.

145
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,920
That's cool.

146
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,920
I don't want to be a hater, but I didn't really like their second album as much as I liked

147
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,280
Since I Left You back when I used to smoke a lot of weed when I was younger.

148
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,060
I mean, Since I Left You was kind of genre busting in that they really took sampling

149
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,060
too far.

150
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,060
Yeah.

151
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,060
They were like, hey, what if...

152
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,060
No, no, no.

153
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,860
I know you like the Amen break and we'll strengthen it.

154
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,560
What if instead we took 48 milliseconds and combined it with 48 milliseconds of 10 million

155
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
other songs?

156
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Yeah.

157
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,320
And like I was just the right age and like I said, smoking tons of weed and Frontier

158
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,240
Psychiatrist like blew my mind.

159
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,720
It blew everybody's mind.

160
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,440
How did you get that parent?

161
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

162
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,800
The music video of it was so bizarre.

163
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

164
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Totally.

165
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,800
I don't know how any other album they made could not kind of be a letdown based on the

166
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,840
experience of that at that time.

167
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Sure, sure.

168
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,520
But I'll try and have an open mind for this other one.

169
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,080
You know, in 2001 you thought they were mind-melting geniuses who were going to change music forever

170
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,600
and then their next album was a really good album if you were good producers, but it's

171
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,360
not, you know, genre-busting, era-defining stuff.

172
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,720
I think the problem is the decade in between.

173
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,120
Like if you put out a sophomore album that's just serviceable or just good the next year,

174
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,800
it's more understandable than like waiting for Chinese democracy and it just being, just

175
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
being eh.

176
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,640
You can't do that.

177
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
That is fair.

178
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
That's fair.

179
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
This one's really good though.

180
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
You can't live up to that hype.

181
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
It's tough.

182
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
This one's great.

183
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,920
They got a bunch of really good guests on it.

184
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,480
They do a lot of like classic trip-hop stuff.

185
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,040
It almost sounds a little Portishead-y.

186
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,200
They get tricky to do a verse.

187
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,600
Then they go full disco.

188
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,200
They got some disco and then they got some classic avalanches walking songs, which is

189
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,880
what the avalanches do best.

190
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,880
I'll check it out.

191
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,280
So, Jordan, today we've got an interesting episode to go over.

192
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,120
We're going to be talking about The Weeknd with the band.

193
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
The band?

194
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
Yes.

195
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
He's that guy.

196
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
Genre-busting!

197
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
He was!

198
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,680
Okay, back in 2007, whenever his first EP's dropped.

199
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,720
I don't know enough about The Weeknd.

200
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
I know quite a bit.

201
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,800
We're going to be talking about the day that was 12-12-2020.

202
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,740
The day out on DC's...

203
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,040
Alex didn't move to DC.

204
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,680
No, I didn't think so.

205
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,320
But he did go to DC.

206
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,720
I assumed he would go.

207
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,840
And so today we're going to be taking a look at some of the events on the nation's capital.

208
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Oh boy.

209
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,260
But first, before we get to that, let's take a moment, Jordan, to say thank you to some

210
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,800
folks who have signed up and are supporting the show.

211
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Oh, that's a great idea.

212
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,600
So first, Bamboozer, thank you so much.

213
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,680
You are now a policy wonk.

214
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,720
I'm a policy wonk.

215
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Thanks Bamboozer!

216
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Thank you.

217
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,800
Next, Jim F. thank you so much.

218
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,160
You are now a policy wonk.

219
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,320
I'm a policy wonk.

220
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Thanks Jim!

221
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Thank you!

222
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Next, Ryon H. thank you so much.

223
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,760
You are now a policy wonk.

224
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,880
I'm a policy wonk.

225
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,880
Thank you RyRy!

226
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,600
That's what I'm calling old Ryons come on.

227
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,320
Next, it could be Jel J-E-L-L-E.

228
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,660
I think it's probably Jel.

229
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,140
Thank you so much.

230
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,320
You are now a policy wonk.

231
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
I'm a policy wonk!

232
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
Thank you very much!

233
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,420
Could be a reference to Cats!

234
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,660
I'm gonna go with Jelle.

235
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,660
Could be a Jellicle.

236
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,660
I'm gonna go with Jelle.

237
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,300
This could be a Jellicle Wonk.

238
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,660
It could be a Jellicle Wonk.

239
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,300
I don't know if they had one of those in the original Cats, though.

240
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,540
Next, Kabir S. Thank you so much, you are now a Policy Wonk.

241
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,540
I'm a Policy Wonk!

242
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,540
Thanks Kabir!

243
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,540
Thank you!

244
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,460
Next, Will O. Thank you so much, you are now a Policy Wonk.

245
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,460
I'm a Policy Wonk!

246
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,460
Thanks Will!

247
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,460
Thank you!

248
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,460
Next, Rebecca O. Thank you so much.

249
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,460
No relation.

250
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,460
Okay.

251
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,460
Uh, thank you, you're a Policy Wonk.

252
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,460
I'm a Policy Wonk!

253
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,460
Thanks Rebecca!

254
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,460
Thank you!

255
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,860
Thank you to a couple of people who donated on Elevated Love and we appreciate that very

256
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,860
much.

257
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,460
So, Andy K. Thank you so much, you are now a Technocrat.

258
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,380
And it goes on.

259
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,300
Thank you so much, you are now a Technocrat.

260
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,300
I'm a Policy Wonk.

261
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,300
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic.

262
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Have yourself a brew.

263
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
How's your 401k doing, bro?

264
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,300
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

265
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,300
Let's just get down to business.

266
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,300
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

267
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,300
Why you pimps so good?

268
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,300
My neck is freakishly large.

269
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,300
I declare info war on you.

270
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
Thank you so much, Andy.

271
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
And thank you so much, Andy.

272
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,300
Thank you so much, Andy.

273
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,300
Thank you so much, Andy.

274
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Thank you so much, Andy.

275
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,980
Thank you so much, Andy, and thank you so much, and it goes on.

276
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,540
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

277
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,820
If you're out there listening and you're thinking, hey, I enjoy the show, I'd like to support

278
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,580
these gents too, you can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com, clicking

279
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,180
the button that says support the show, or...

280
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,020
Or what you could do is you could go to a record store, go back into the back part of

281
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,260
the record store, start searching through all your favorite bands, maybe some disco

282
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,820
bands, maybe some esoteric stuff that other people haven't seen, find some generosity

283
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,820
in there.

284
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,860
Get a little bits of the best generosity from each one of those little crates over there,

285
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,860
combine it together to make something amazingly generous, and take it to your local bail fund

286
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,860
or charity.

287
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,860
Bigging in the crates!

288
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,860
Yep.

289
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,860
Uh, great.

290
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,860
Yeah.

291
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,860
Thank you.

292
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,860
Yeah.

293
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,860
So, Jordan.

294
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
Yes, sir.

295
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,860
Today.

296
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,860
What about it?

297
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,060
We are going to be talking about the rallies that happened in DC over the weekend.

298
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,060
Yeah, they went great.

299
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,220
Now, one thing that's really difficult for me is I'm not going to be addressing, really,

300
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,860
the street violence.

301
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,860
Sure.

302
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,300
And I think that that is a failing of our show to an extent, and that is because I don't

303
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,340
have enough time to get into it.

304
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:38,900
Not on our show, I mean in terms of, like, cover it with the seriousness and the focus

305
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,740
that I think the topic deserves.

306
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,900
Sure, we're a silly show about Alex Jones.

307
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,900
Yes.

308
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:50,440
I don't want to give short shrift to that, but at the same time, it falls slightly outside

309
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,740
of what I have the time to cover.

310
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,500
As we've seen with Rogan, half-assing it is sometimes worse than doing anything at all.

311
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,140
Yes, but I did not want people to think that I turn a blind eye to that kind of thing,

312
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,800
or tacitly accept such, such.

313
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,700
So Jordan, on Saturday, there were multiple rallies that were happening in DC, surrounding

314
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,460
the idea that this election had been stolen.

315
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,460
Stop that steal.

316
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,460
You know what I'm saying?

317
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,460
Sure.

318
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,460
They were both about the same thing, had the same theme, and even featured some overlapping

319
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,460
speakers.

320
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,860
It was super confusing, but I think I know what was up.

321
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,700
One of the rallies was being held by the Women for America First, the group that formed out

322
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,100
of the Tea Party, which is trying to use these protests and some of this unrest to secure

323
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,220
more power for the Republican Party, while simultaneously trying to make the Republican

324
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,180
Party as weird as possible, like they did with the Tea Party.

325
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,180
Yes, correct.

326
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:46,780
The other rally was called the Jericho March, which made no secret about just being an overtly

327
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,780
Christian extremist rally with some really outrageous planned speakers.

328
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:57,020
Well, if I remember my story of Jericho well, I believe those people were the nice ones.

329
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:04,620
They decided to end the siege by negotiating, coming to a fair solution for both parties,

330
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,620
right?

331
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,620
Sure.

332
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,620
Yeah.

333
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,300
That Jericho March had Ali Alexander in the mix, a friend from Infowars.

334
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,860
They also had the Cowboys for Trump, and noted asshole slash Congress member Paul Gosar.

335
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,400
It's really hard for me to tell what exactly was going on, and I kind of don't think that

336
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,560
these two were opposing rallies per se.

337
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,060
Your instinct would be to think that the Jericho March was for the religious zealots, whereas

338
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,120
the Women for America First would be the more restrained one.

339
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,220
But honestly, the rallies were almost identical.

340
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,220
Yeah, they're both the same people.

341
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,220
I watched both of them.

342
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,320
Yeah, they're the same people.

343
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,300
Not all the same people, but it's the same vibe.

344
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I mean.

345
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,180
Yeah.

346
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,180
Both featured Mike Flynn giving the same speech, both had appearances from and got funding

347
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,840
from the MyPillow guy, and both were overwhelmingly religious.

348
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:58,420
Watching these rallies, one thing that's abundantly clear to me, and that's something that I think

349
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,220
is very important for us to bring up, is we're not dealing with politics here at all.

350
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,860
This is not politics.

351
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:10,220
This is a cult with some interest in politics as a means to gaining and retaining power,

352
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,180
and I don't really know how to talk about that without, like, I don't know.

353
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,660
I don't know how to engage with the ideas of a cult.

354
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:24,360
Um, I mean, I think the best way to engage with the ideas of cult is on a grand scale,

355
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,540
and what we should do to stimulate the economy is train 50% of the country in cult deprogramming

356
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,780
to help them with the other 50%.

357
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,780
That's a new deal.

358
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,900
I think that's a good way to do it.

359
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,820
It's like the Works Progress Administration.

360
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Sure.

361
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,820
Yeah.

362
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,380
It's just, it's really difficult because it comes off, or it can be, like, misconstrued

363
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,140
as attacking religion to attack this kind of thing that's going on, and I don't have

364
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,940
any interest in attacking religion or Christianity, I have a problem with what this is.

365
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,940
Yeah.

366
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,940
And that's tough.

367
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,100
Because when we hear a person say that Bill Gates said X, Y, or Z in an interview, it's

368
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,020
really easy to go find that interview and discuss what's going on.

369
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,380
When we hear that same person say that God has chosen Donald Trump to be president, it's

370
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,260
not too difficult to say that they're a bit of a fanatic, and they're probably unwell.

371
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:15,980
The difficulty comes when there are two multi-hour rallies attended by thousands of people where

372
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,860
the speakers repeatedly and incessantly insist that God has chosen Trump to be president,

373
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,060
and everyone cheers.

374
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,060
Mm-hmm.

375
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,060
That's tough.

376
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,060
Yeah.

377
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,060
That is really fucked up.

378
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,060
Yeah.

379
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,700
We know where Alex is at, we know where his head is, we know what he's up to, and so I

380
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,660
thought maybe a good use of our time today would be to look at these rallies themselves,

381
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,300
and try and assess where we're at with all this, and see if it's something that we can

382
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,740
learn to talk about a little bit better, and see if there's anybody who pops up who is

383
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,300
a particularly good crazy.

384
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,300
Oh, good.

385
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,700
Maybe there'll be somebody who's like... If this is-

386
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,340
I don't think Hamamoto's coming back.

387
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,340
No.

388
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
No.

389
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,340
No.

390
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,340
I don't think Hamamoto got his invite for this one.

391
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,340
Daryl is on the outs.

392
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,340
I think we can let that one go.

393
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,340
Yeah.

394
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,100
He's still yelling at Linda Katehi out at UC Davis.

395
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
Okay.

396
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:11,580
No, but I figure like, hey, you've got one... I think each rally was at least four hours

397
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,580
long.

398
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,580
Jesus.

399
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,580
You've got a lot of speakers.

400
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,580
Yeah.

401
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,900
Maybe somebody is going to be like, all right, you got something, or maybe you got a weirdness,

402
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,780
I'm going to be interested in looking into.

403
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,780
All right.

404
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,660
So maybe that's worth our time.

405
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,680
So we're going to start here, Jordan, with the Jericho March.

406
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,020
This was hosted by Eric Mataxas.

407
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,460
I'm kind of aware of who this guy is.

408
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:37,660
He's like a Christian writer and a radio host, but I really don't know a ton about him.

409
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,780
And based on his work emceeing this event, that will probably be the way it stays, because

410
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,700
this dude is straight up boring as hell.

411
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Oh, come on, man.

412
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,660
A whole lot of awful stage patter type material, and then just calls to praise the Lord.

413
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,660
Oh, boy.

414
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,660
Okay.

415
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,660
Yeah.

416
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,980
So we're starting with the one that's more explicitly religious, and you get that right

417
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,980
from the job.

418
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,660
So we're going to get some Ace Freely band talk, and then we're going to smooth into

419
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,660
the...

420
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,660
First of all, it's Paul Stanley.

421
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,660
Whatever.

422
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,660
How dare you.

423
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,660
Whatever.

424
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,660
Yes.

425
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,460
Eric Mataxas does have some things he needs to get off his chest.

426
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,460
Okay, there we go.

427
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,460
He comes in, he's like, hey, what's up, DC?

428
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,300
I heard y'all like the taste of alcohol.

429
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,900
All right.

430
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,500
Let's overthrow democracy forever.

431
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,900
All right, let's move on.

432
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,020
Who out there is drinking screwdrivers?

433
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:34,100
It doesn't start with that, it starts very religious.

434
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,240
We are here because we love the God of the Bible.

435
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,340
We are here because we believe he is the God of history.

436
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:52,620
We're here because we know that he is the God who does real miracles.

437
00:15:52,620 --> 00:16:00,660
When his remnant cries out to him in humility and love and says, Abba, Father.

438
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,660
We need you, Abba, Father.

439
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:12,000
We are here today to cry out to the God of heaven, to ask him to have mercy on the greatest

440
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,420
nation in the history of the world.

441
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,860
So it's pretty overtly religious.

442
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,540
Yeah, that one's a little bit on the nose.

443
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,060
That's like maybe 15 seconds into the rally.

444
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,580
I'm glad we got the tone set.

445
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,460
We were worshipping the God of history.

446
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,460
All right.

447
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,460
All right.

448
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,460
Yikes.

449
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:37,420
So this rally itself, this Jericho march, was the product apparently of two people who

450
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,860
had a vision.

451
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,020
And Eric Metaxas is going to discuss that here.

452
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,020
Oh boy.

453
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:49,620
Now the man and the woman who didn't know each other until a little while ago, Rob Weaver

454
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:56,620
and Irina Grossu, okay, each of them independently, in case you didn't know the story, each of

455
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,020
them had an insane vision from God.

456
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,700
How would we know the story?

457
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,600
Rob Weaver told me this story a few nights ago.

458
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,420
He says he doesn't normally get visions like this and the Lord woke him up.

459
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:21,660
It's a dramatic story and he had this insane open vision of people gathered blowing shofars.

460
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,580
There were nuns there when he described it to me exactly.

461
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:30,500
The bad news is it looked nothing like this and you guys need to leave right now.

462
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
I was kidding.

463
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
That was a joke.

464
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,020
He had a vision from God.

465
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,840
When God gives you a vision, you don't need to know anything else.

466
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,460
You just praise him that he cares enough to show you what he is doing.

467
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,260
I have vision questions too.

468
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,740
We'll learn more about this vision later.

469
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,940
But the thing that I think is interesting is that is a terrible joke.

470
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,620
I would have to go with yes, that is a terrible joke.

471
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,420
But at the same time, that's what he's doing.

472
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:04,100
And I think actually, if I were the promoter or the booker of this, he's a perfect host.

473
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,220
No, he's doing a great job for what he's doing.

474
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,680
He comes off slightly charismatic.

475
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,740
It's not offensive, but you can still tell it's an attempt at humor.

476
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,460
He's personable to the audience that's the target of this rally.

477
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,460
But it's also trash.

478
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,200
Yeah, but it's unmemorably a bad joke where you're like, joke registered.

479
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,700
You know what, I'm not going to hold it against you.

480
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,700
We're just going to move on.

481
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,340
It does feel like somebody who's there for a check.

482
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,020
Who's like, I'll get paid.

483
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,020
Gotta clock in.

484
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,820
Yeah, I've done those gigs before.

485
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,340
It's almost a cut and paste kind of host joke.

486
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,860
And I think you see a lot of that if you do enough stand up and you can kind of get that

487
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,860
vibe from him.

488
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,940
But at the same time, I kind of prefer that to someone who's maybe taken too big a swing.

489
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,740
Sometimes that goes really badly.

490
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:57,100
I would give a lot of money to see this guy try and do crowd work at one of these rallies.

491
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,420
That would be brutal.

492
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,500
So we got these two people, they had a vision.

493
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,740
One is Rob Weaver.

494
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,960
He is an evangelical Christian.

495
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,180
And then Aria Grosu, who is a Catholic.

496
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:13,300
And so the two of them both had a vision and the, uh, yeah, we'll, we'll meet them a little

497
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,060
bit later, but that's why this is happening.

498
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,060
All right.

499
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:21,260
So this is happening because the evangelical Christians and the Catholics have finally

500
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,100
both received the independent message from God that they were looking for in order to

501
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:33,180
combine and put aside their previous doctrinal differences in order to take back Trump's

502
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,180
presidency.

503
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,180
Right.

504
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:40,780
Your whole fucking religion boils down to Trump, you pathetic shitbags.

505
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,420
That's the part that I really have trouble with is like, I have nothing against religion.

506
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,940
I have nothing against Christianity.

507
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,020
I have a real problem with the way in which there be like Christianity and Trump are being

508
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,020
melded.

509
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,020
Yeah.

510
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,220
I mean, when we're talking about this religion, I'm not going to shit on Christianity as a

511
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,020
as like quote unquote concept or religion as a whole.

512
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:07,080
But I will say that it is eminently reasonable to shit on your religion.

513
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,660
If you think that your ultimate battle of good and evil involves Donald fucking Trump,

514
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,660
that is tough to wrestle with.

515
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,660
Yeah.

516
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,120
Your religion is so tiny and weak and meaningless.

517
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,540
If that's, if that's what it is, yeah.

518
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,300
If it relies on Donald Trump, uh, yeah.

519
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:31,760
And when you hear things like this and it's just like, what we are, what God is doing

520
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,340
in the United States today by his grace.

521
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,820
And today we're going to see heaven move.

522
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,860
Heaven is going to move.

523
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,560
Thank you, Jesus.

524
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,380
Thank you, Jesus.

525
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:52,760
Before I introduce my friend Mike Lindell, who's going to tell you to use the discount

526
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,060
code Eric because I would never do that.

527
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:00,420
That would be self serving before I introduced Mike Lindell.

528
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,220
I'd like to lead you in the pledge of allegiance.

529
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:08,580
So like he's talking about how God is going to make heaven move and then immediately he's

530
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,260
going to introduce the MyPillow guy and he gives a promo code.

531
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,980
God does not give promo codes.

532
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,980
Mike Lindell does.

533
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,980
Yeah, I get that.

534
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,360
But if you're at a religious rally and somebody gives you a promo code, then leave.

535
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,820
One of the problems that I find with both of these rallies is they are very clearly

536
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,820
funded by MyPillow.

537
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,860
He's very clearly.

538
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,860
It's spawncon?

539
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,100
Is this spawncon?

540
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,100
Is that what we're doing?

541
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,100
I think it might be.

542
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,860
At your religious rally, there's sponsored content.

543
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,860
Okay.

544
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,860
Fuck off.

545
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,300
I'm a bit worried that that is the case.

546
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,380
And that means that he gets to speak.

547
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,380
He gets a walk on roll.

548
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,380
You get to buy your way in.

549
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,380
Yeah.

550
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,380
So MyPillow guy.

551
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,700
Nothing says Jesus more than buying five minutes of stage time.

552
00:21:52,700 --> 00:22:00,900
So right before this event, there had been that Supreme Court had thrown out the case

553
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,900
in Pennsylvania.

554
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,140
Yeah, they screamed it was too legally good.

555
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,140
Yes.

556
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,740
And the MyPillow guy has some news about this that he received.

557
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,060
First of all, he says that Sidney Powell called him at two in the morning to give him some

558
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,060
news.

559
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,060
Good.

560
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,060
Why is she calling you at two in the morning?

561
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,500
He's the MyPillow guy, Dan.

562
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,460
He's the front coordinator.

563
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,780
I got problems with this story.

564
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,900
Hello, everyone.

565
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,940
I'm going to start off by bringing you some hope.

566
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:34,420
Last night, about two in the morning, I got a text from Sidney Powell's team, and the

567
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:40,220
Texas lawsuits had nothing to do with what she's been working hard on.

568
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:49,500
And she filed her lawsuits with the Supreme Court for Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, and

569
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,460
Arizona.

570
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,020
And everything that I've been telling you for three weeks now is true.

571
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,420
I have seen it.

572
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:09,100
The fraud is 100%, and Donald Trump will be our president for four more years.

573
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,420
By a pillow.

574
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,420
Wow.

575
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,420
Wow.

576
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,420
Yeah.

577
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,420
So sorry, I said Pennsylvania.

578
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,660
I meant that Texas space.

579
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
Yeah.

580
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,900
All these sad attempts to overturn the election mixed up.

581
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:27,740
But yeah, I like the idea that Sidney Powell texted him and was like, hey, that had nothing

582
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,740
to do with me.

583
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,740
Don't worry about me.

584
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,740
Don't worry about me.

585
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,880
I'm on crazy adventure number four over here.

586
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,140
This looks like a big setback, but that was not our deal.

587
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,260
Hold on.

588
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,260
I'm not even there.

589
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,260
Watch out.

590
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,580
I got to watch this guy rip a heart out of another dude.

591
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,600
I like that.

592
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:51,900
And it does set the tone, kind of, for the event, and that is everybody is joyous.

593
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,220
Turns out that there was this big setback where Texas and, you know, like all these

594
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:02,380
people had signed on, all these Republican members of the House had signed on with this

595
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,740
and then it didn't work.

596
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:11,460
It seemed like, hey, that was kind of almost like Ron Paul winning the Iowa caucus of this

597
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,500
cycle.

598
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,260
There's that moment of hope and then it's gone, but no, my pillow guy says Sidney Powell

599
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,100
texted him at two in the morning and said, hey, be cool.

600
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,100
So wild.

601
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,100
Yeah.

602
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:26,380
So I would buy this making sense if I knew that all of the rich Republicans and business

603
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:31,220
owners and all that stuff were all like buying a lot of property in a different country right

604
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,260
now and all of them slowly moving all of their stuff away.

605
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:40,220
So I get all this like edging with the lawsuits is them buying time to make good their escape

606
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,820
before they pull the trigger and everybody explodes, you know, but otherwise this doesn't

607
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,820
make any sense.

608
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,860
What are you doing?

609
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,340
My pillow, you're wasting a lot of money.

610
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,740
He must be making a lot too though.

611
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,740
He must be.

612
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,740
Yeah.

613
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,540
But they're not going to, they don't make any sense.

614
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,540
They're all magic.

615
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,540
Yeah.

616
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,540
I don't know.

617
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:05,140
But also when you consider, I mean, not, you know, this guy, the my pillow guy is out there,

618
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,140
man.

619
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,140
Yeah.

620
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,140
I can see that.

621
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,660
And basically you listen to him talk for like two minutes and you're like, Oh yeah, I get

622
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,140
why you'd make bad business decisions.

623
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,480
Yeah, that's fair.

624
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,060
Here he discusses in a rambling way, his story of having a prophetic dream about how he was

625
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,060
going to meet.

626
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,060
Why does everybody got dreams all of a sudden?

627
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,060
Everyone.

628
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,060
I'm sick of dreams.

629
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:29,180
So he has a dream about how he's going to meet Trump and then he, he, he does.

630
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,560
And look, I, and also I want to say really quick, he talks a bunch about how he's a recovering

631
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,980
crack addict and I'm not beaten up on that.

632
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,580
You're not making fun of that at all is just sort of background dressing to this story

633
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,580
that's important.

634
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,580
Good for you.

635
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,160
I got up to 2015 and I had a dream.

636
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,460
I get these dreams, these, these prophetic dreams.

637
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,160
And one of them was that I would meet Donald Trump in a room and I'm going, why would I,

638
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,780
why would I be meeting with Donald Trump in a room or whatever?

639
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,260
I was just some, some guy from Minnesota.

640
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,260
Right?

641
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,000
Well, and two things in the summer, buying appointments kept happened to me.

642
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,460
I was invited to the national prayer breakfast when, when Ben Carson was still running for

643
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:15,700
president randomly picked out of 12 people to pray with him in a room and I wasn't even

644
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,700
saved yet.

645
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,700
I'm going in.

646
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,700
I don't know how to pray.

647
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,700
I don't know.

648
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,900
You know, I was all nervous, but that was set up by God, you know, and, and then there

649
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:31,180
were these things kept happening to the summer of 2016 and I'm on a plane to, to California

650
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:36,840
and, and I'm, I'm sitting in the bulkhead and I opened this magazine that was about

651
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
Donald Trump.

652
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,660
And I said, you know, of course it was August or the late July of 2016.

653
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,620
And I said, God, I said, if I'm supposed to be Donald Trump and be part of this, whatever's

654
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,180
going on in our country, I need to know right now.

655
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:56,100
And at that moment in time, my phone dinged and it was an email, Mike, will you, this

656
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,100
is Donald Trump.

657
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,520
Will you meet me in New York city at Trump tower?

658
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,220
I go, God, you know, I don't believe that story.

659
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,380
I don't believe a word of that bullshit.

660
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,700
Not for one second.

661
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Yeah.

662
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,700
Jesus Christ.

663
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Yeah.

664
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,700
I'm, I'm, I'm not buying it.

665
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,700
No.

666
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,700
Uh, but it's fun.

667
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
And the crowd will like it.

668
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,700
Uh, yeah.

669
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:20,460
But I just, this story is, is, is I just was listening to this, I'm like, Hey man, is this

670
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
an event?

671
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,460
Jesse Ventura character.

672
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,900
It kind of feels fucking, this is Minnesota stuff, man.

673
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,940
That's, that's what I'm saying is these dudes sound like Minnesota.

674
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,940
It must be if they sound almost exactly the same.

675
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,300
So many vocal similarities.

676
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,300
Yeah.

677
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,300
That's fair.

678
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,300
That's fair.

679
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,300
That's fair.

680
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,300
I don't know.

681
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,740
I, we need to move the pressure now up back onto religious people.

682
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,900
You know, it used to be that when you were shitting on religion, that was like, that

683
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,660
was often a discriminatory or being mean.

684
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,380
Now we've got to push the responsibility back on there.

685
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,820
Religious people, if you don't want to be made fun of, don't listen to the, my pillow

686
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,820
guy.

687
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,820
That's on you now.

688
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,260
But the problem is he has so much money.

689
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,260
Yeah.

690
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,980
See, that's still on you.

691
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,620
All religion jokes are fine.

692
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,800
They are non-discriminatory until the majority of religious people are like, let's not do

693
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,880
my pillow guy.

694
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
I don't agree.

695
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
I don't agree with that.

696
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
Uh, axiom.

697
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,580
I don't believe I don't agree with that.

698
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:24,300
Uh, but that the issue comes down to like religion is fine, but this isn't about religion.

699
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,900
This is about wanting a Christian nation.

700
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,260
And my pillow guy is pretty clear about that.

701
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,900
This has been a spiritual battle in our country for decades.

702
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:38,060
This is a spiritual battle and we are in the, we're going to, this is the start of the greatest

703
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:42,620
revival in history for one nation under God.

704
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,020
And that God is Jesus.

705
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,020
Amen.

706
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,020
God bless you all.

707
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,820
Jesus wouldn't even say, and we're going to look back and we're going to say that all

708
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,500
had to happen in the name of Jesus.

709
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
God bless you.

710
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Wow.

711
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,500
Hallelujah.

712
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,540
I love you, Mikey.

713
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,940
You know, you want to know miracle of God.

714
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,900
He went 60 seconds short.

715
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,900
Haha.

716
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,900
Good job.

717
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,900
Whoa boy.

718
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,300
Um, that guy is killing it.

719
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,300
Yeah.

720
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,780
I mean, almost everything that Mike is saying, uh, my pillow guy is saying is like, okay,

721
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,780
yeah.

722
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,180
I mean, if that was just at a, like a church revival or something like that, I don't think

723
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,700
I'd have any issue with it.

724
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,440
Like there's an awakening coming and you know, like God is, uh, you know, so important in

725
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
our life.

726
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,020
The problem is this is a political rally.

727
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:32,020
You know, I know it's of a religious character, but like the reason you're having this rally

728
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,620
is because Trump lost an election.

729
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,620
Yeah.

730
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,920
You're not having this because of like, no, no, he had a prophetic dream.

731
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,260
It's the combination of the two.

732
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,540
That's just fucking, uh, it's, uh, it's terrifying.

733
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,540
Yeah.

734
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:50,980
I think probably one of the reasons that I would have an easier time, like suggesting

735
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:58,880
that this was, I suppose non-religious is just cause I know too much about how Christianity

736
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,420
is supposed to work according to that book they say they like a lot.

737
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,540
I've read a little bit of it.

738
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,540
Yeah.

739
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,060
I know too much about it and all of this stuff is like, we're Christians and we want a Christian

740
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,060
nation.

741
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,040
And I'm like, have you motherfuckers even opened it?

742
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,620
And also here's a promo code from my pillow.

743
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,620
Exactly.

744
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,620
Exactly.

745
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:23,140
And the thing that makes me even more scared really when I think about it is that, you

746
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,740
know, there's this combination of this stuff, this Christian nationalism, and then it's

747
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:34,060
also intersecting with this deification, uh, admiration and, and, and, and just love of

748
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:41,460
not only Trump, but also general Flynn, who is somebody who's a hero, the QAnon folk and

749
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,420
has been, uh, uh, Q, QE himself.

750
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:50,380
And I hear Eric Metaxas, uh, teases, uh, Flynn's appearance in a little bit.

751
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,340
We have general Michael Flynn is coming.

752
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:00,220
Oh, Oh, then you've heard of him.

753
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,100
Oh, I'm so impressed.

754
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,100
Very good.

755
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,540
You guys, uh, that's awesome.

756
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,140
He is such a hero.

757
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,220
He has been such hell.

758
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,740
He's a Patriot.

759
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,380
He believes in the Lord of the Bible.

760
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,380
All right.

761
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,660
A lot of the people, the center of this administration love Jesus.

762
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,660
Don't you find that ironic?

763
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,100
I don't know what he's even saying.

764
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,820
I don't know what that's supposed to mean at all.

765
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,420
No, but that's the, you, you asked for like, why is he hero?

766
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,500
And then Metaxas told you because he believes in the God of the Bible.

767
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,620
I really don't feel like that's enough.

768
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,180
That's what, I mean, that's what they're saying.

769
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,300
I think another problem I have is that they are cheering for thoroughly fictitious people.

770
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,300
Flynn, the imaginary Flynn.

771
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,300
Yeah.

772
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,460
The imaginary Flynn is who they are cheering for.

773
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,220
Michael Flynn has no resemblance to that character whatsoever.

774
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,220
Yeah.

775
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,340
He's a shit bag from way before if they knew his history, they would, if I were him, I

776
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,940
would lean into the fan fiction way more than way more of the fan fiction.

777
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,940
Yeah.

778
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,940
Yeah.

779
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,340
Your actual track record is fucking evil.

780
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,340
Yeah.

781
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:04,140
So now Metaxas brings out, uh, Rob Weaver and Irina Grossu, who are the, uh, the, uh,

782
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,420
evangelical and the Catholic dreamers.

783
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:13,500
And, uh, Rob, I would say his description of this vision that he had is a little bit

784
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,500
lackluster.

785
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,340
Um, this event will be going on for the next few hours, lots of speakers, more music.

786
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:23,980
Um, but I want to tell you about how it started on November 5th, I was really, um, troubled

787
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,980
by the election and what I knew was wrong.

788
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,300
I think everybody in this country knows that something is wrong.

789
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,900
Can I get an amen anyone?

790
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:38,660
So I just call, I called out to God and I literally felt something pushing in my side

791
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,660
in the morning.

792
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,900
Quite frankly, I thought it was a remote, but it wasn't, you know, I, somebody, something

793
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,900
was pushing.

794
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,740
I heard a voice that said, it's not over.

795
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:52,300
So can I hear it's not over because God said it's not over and the, and the next part of

796
00:32:52,300 --> 00:33:01,520
the vision, I sat down and I literally saw this and I saw marches going around the Capitol.

797
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,000
I saw marches going around all six of the swing States that are also going on today.

798
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So hello.

799
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
If you guys can hear us there.

800
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,600
Um, so every one of them, let's, let's, let's give them a shout.

801
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,380
So this was birthed from a vision or a miracle.

802
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,940
That's not much of a vision.

803
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,940
Wow.

804
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,940
Yeah.

805
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,060
So does that mean that, uh, God was poking him?

806
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:31,100
Well, does that mean that for like, say the women's March was that inspired by God?

807
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,100
Must've been.

808
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,700
Or did, did, did the devil send that dream?

809
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,700
Devil probably.

810
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,700
Are God and the devil only sending competing dreams for rallies and shit now?

811
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:45,040
Devil's clearly a better organizer too because the turnouts have been much larger to the

812
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:50,060
point where, uh, these MAGA folk will just post pictures of left wing marches.

813
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,060
Their marches.

814
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,060
Yeah.

815
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,060
It does seem strange.

816
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,060
Yeah.

817
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,940
They should, they should get in contact with the devil.

818
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,940
He knows what's up.

819
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,940
Yeah.

820
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,940
He has a good street team.

821
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,940
Yeah.

822
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:05,700
The, the, uh, Robin arena are, are just there and you know, they had their vision.

823
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,700
Hooray.

824
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,700
Good for them.

825
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,460
I had a dream of people walking around DC, which could never have been given to me from

826
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,100
any other source other than God.

827
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,100
And he got poked.

828
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,560
Um, so that's true.

829
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,020
Then they have a prayer.

830
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,700
There's a lot of praying on this that I will, a lot of people through both of these rallies,

831
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,880
everybody wants to get up there and do the Lord's blood to do a good prayer.

832
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:33,220
You know, like how in the book it said, make sure that you pray loudly and performatively

833
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,380
for others and not for God.

834
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:42,240
It reminds me of like, okay, so like in early times, uh, in wrestling, you didn't want in

835
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,740
your first match someone to go through a table, let's say, because then if you want to do

836
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:53,020
that in the, the headline of the match, I feel like everybody is not respecting that

837
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,900
in terms of the Lord's prayer.

838
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,300
Like everyone's doing it, but everyone wants to, can you, I don't know.

839
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,500
It's just, it feels less, save your Lord's prayer for the end of the show.

840
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,500
Right.

841
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
Or Flynn.

842
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,900
I mean, he's clearly the headliner.

843
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,940
It's his to do or not do.

844
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
Right.

845
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,940
I don't know.

846
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,940
Anyway.

847
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,380
Uh, they pray and uh, we get a prayer that Steve Pechenik would be very proud of.

848
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,860
And then the stage gets interrupted.

849
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:23,600
Father, I pray a special blessing on Melania Trump, one of the best first ladies we've

850
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,180
ever had in history.

851
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,720
And I'm so tired of people coming against her father.

852
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
So go on.

853
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Why?

854
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,500
I pray and her children and all the children in Jesus mighty name.

855
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,500
Thank you Lord.

856
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,500
Amen.

857
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Thank you guys.

858
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:43,520
Oh, actually we want to introduce these Ollie Alexander from stop the seal.

859
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,220
So Ali had sort of walked out on stage prayer.

860
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,600
See the devil's a way better organizer.

861
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:57,660
So Ali walks out along with Ed Martin of the Phyllis Schlafly Eagle Forum and they are

862
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,740
apparently partnered with the, uh, the Jericho March.

863
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,100
And that's kind of interesting.

864
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:08,300
Um, because Ali starts talking about like, you know, Hey, we got, we got a lot of fun

865
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
things coming up.

866
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,300
We got general Flynn.

867
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,660
Then he says something that really struck my ears.

868
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,100
Today is going to be historic.

869
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,100
We have general Flynn.

870
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,660
We'll have the president of the sky or on the road and we got a couple of other characters

871
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,620
in a spirit of unification.

872
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,620
Thank y'all.

873
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,340
You got a couple of other characters in the spirit of unification.

874
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,820
That's very strange.

875
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,820
Also the presidents in the sky, they, uh, they have, uh, been promoting that Trump is

876
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,980
going to fly over in a Marine one.

877
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,980
Great.

878
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,500
Uh, and I think he does show up like during Flynn's speech, maybe.

879
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
I don't know.

880
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,060
Uh, there was a helicopter flying over at some point.

881
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,060
Straight up.

882
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:48,180
We're doing straight up fascist Nazi imagery.

883
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,700
I honestly don't know if Trump was even in it.

884
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,060
No, I doubt he was.

885
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,060
Why would you?

886
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,060
You wouldn't need to be.

887
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,060
Yeah.

888
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,460
They'll just see the helicopter and be like, eh, the president's in there.

889
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,460
Why would you actually go?

890
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,460
Symbol of president.

891
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,100
What is he going to wave out the helicopter window?

892
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,700
Get the fuck out of here.

893
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,020
So Ed Martin of the Eagle forum, the Schleifly Eagles.

894
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,020
Yes.

895
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,020
Yeah.

896
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,020
Yeah.

897
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,860
He wants, while he's up on stage, he's a magnanimous type.

898
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,860
Oh, of course.

899
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,980
And he wants to give it up to the good media.

900
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,740
Oh, Hey guys, we're gonna, we're gonna right now.

901
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,400
I'd ask you to join me in prayer if you don't mind before we do, I want to say thank you

902
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:29,180
to the Epic times for helping stream so much of this live Josh and, and RSBN bar, the brothers

903
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,220
at RSBN brothers and sisters.

904
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,020
Thank you for what you do to make it so people, yeah.

905
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,220
And victory, victory TV and one America news.

906
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,580
I mean, go down the list, right?

907
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:43,820
And I just want to say when we gathered at the Capitol the other day around the world

908
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:48,380
in Japan and China and Taiwan around the world, they're looking at America because we're a

909
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:52,620
beacon on the Hill and we can't let the light go out.

910
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,820
There cannot be the light going out for the world and for each other.

911
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,820
Let's pray.

912
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:03,260
One name conspicuous in its absence on that list, especially considering this dude standing

913
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:12,440
right next to Ali Alexander, who's constantly on info, all these great media outlets really

914
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,860
doing everything for it.

915
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,620
I just, I can't get to them all.

916
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,060
I'm going to name as many as I can.

917
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,060
Epic is great.

918
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,060
One American news.

919
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,380
Look, I'm running out of time.

920
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,380
I can't name anymore.

921
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,020
I just want to say, you know, yeah.

922
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:32,580
So look, they may not plug in for wars, but they are willing to let Alex give a little

923
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,580
speech.

924
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,580
Okay.

925
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,140
And so at this point, the mission impossible theme plays.

926
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,140
Oh no.

927
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,140
Here it comes.

928
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:45,460
Folks in the spirit of unity, I'd like to bring out my new friend, Alex Jones.

929
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:53,260
Is it, I think his name is Alex Jones.

930
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,780
Can't believe that many people cheer for him.

931
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:06,340
You know, see this makes sense though.

932
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,700
It does like as a wrestling, this is a wrestling show.

933
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,700
This is what you want.

934
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,780
You bring, you bring Alexander to be like, yeah, that's what you want.

935
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,460
And that's why people are cheering.

936
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,460
He is a star.

937
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,460
He's a show.

938
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,460
Yeah.

939
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,460
Yeah.

940
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,380
You want to hear Rob and Irena Grosu talk about their lackluster dream.

941
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,780
I had a dream that people would be here.

942
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,980
How excited are you going to get for the MyPillow guy telling a long story about his dream?

943
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:35,580
I think it was, I think it was December 20th, 19th, no, this was November 11th.

944
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:39,060
No, this was December 20th at 4.50 p.m.

945
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:44,120
Eric Matexis is a good host or whatever to keep the thing moving along, but he's not

946
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,700
going to get you riled up.

947
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,700
No.

948
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,700
Alex fucking Jones is.

949
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,700
That's what he's going to do.

950
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,700
Yeah.

951
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,700
That's what he's there for.

952
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,700
Yeah, exactly.

953
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,700
Now it's embarrassing.

954
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,700
Very.

955
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,700
Didn't even get your name.

956
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:59,060
Your rally is now the one that allowed Alex to speak at it.

957
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,740
So congratulations for that.

958
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,740
Yep.

959
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,960
But Alex does what Alex does.

960
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,660
And that is more or less just yell his ass off about nonsense.

961
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,660
Like what they want.

962
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,660
Applause line.

963
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,660
Exactly.

964
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,660
Applause line.

965
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,660
Applause line.

966
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,660
And Jesus Christ is King!

967
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:25,940
Not David Rockefeller, not Bill Gates, not Barack Obama, not Joe Biden, but Jesus Christ

968
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,940
is King!

969
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:35,740
And God gave us and rose up Donald Trump to stand against the enemy and draw out the enemy.

970
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:41,420
So as dark as some of these days are, understand, this is the beginning of the great revival

971
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,460
before the Antichrist comes!

972
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,460
Two quick points.

973
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,180
That's not how it works in the Bible!

974
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,180
Two quick points.

975
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,940
I thought Obama was the Antichrist, Alex.

976
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,940
Don't worry about it.

977
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,260
And the second point, I believe on our last episode, he was calling Marilyn Monroe a cum

978
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,260
dump.

979
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,260
He was doing that.

980
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,260
Yeah, yeah.

981
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,260
Where are we?

982
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,260
There's a little bit going on.

983
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,260
What are we doing?

984
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:07,620
I like the idea of Jesus standing next to Alex Jones giving him that, hey, but I'm about

985
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,620
peace.

986
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,780
I was going to feed all these people.

987
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,580
Okay, well, let's just skip past that part then.

988
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,980
Let's just get to the Book of Revelations.

989
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,020
You realize there isn't a revival before-

990
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,020
Hey, Jesus.

991
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,020
No.

992
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,020
Do you understand?

993
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,580
I'm even going to blow your mind a little bit more with this.

994
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,580
Jesus.

995
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,580
Jesus.

996
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,580
No one's going to clap for that weak shit.

997
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:31,020
The Antichrist convinces almost all Christians to believe in him over-

998
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,140
We got a blowout sale.

999
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:38,820
It's actually almost like, so they would focus on a single person instead of the Lord and

1000
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:44,780
really be like, this person is the true leader and we're going to give all of our allegiances

1001
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,300
to him without thinking about it.

1002
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,300
And then because of that-

1003
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,300
You sound like a damn globalist.

1004
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,300
You know what?

1005
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,300
You're right.

1006
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,300
I'm going to have to go.

1007
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,420
So it turns out we're in Revelation, according to Alex.

1008
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,340
And again, this is all just applause lines.

1009
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:05,340
World government, implantable microchips, Satanism, it's out of the open, the Bible

1010
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:13,140
is fulfilled, Revelation is fulfilled, Jesus Christ is fulfilled, God Almighty is in charge,

1011
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,260
and we follow that mighty God.

1012
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,260
Is this who?

1013
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:24,620
You look at the miserable globalist, you look at people like Bill Gates, and you look at

1014
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:32,220
people like Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of them, they are miserable slaves of Satan.

1015
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:38,420
And we pray for them and hope that the Holy Spirit can still touch their soul.

1016
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,500
Like this is embarrassing, but you get why people enjoy this.

1017
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Oh yeah, this is great.

1018
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,780
It's incredibly dumb.

1019
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,780
This is what you go for.

1020
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,780
It's exciting.

1021
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1022
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,780
This is star quality.

1023
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,780
Totally.

1024
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,780
Whatever it is.

1025
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,760
But you can also tell if you watch this that it really takes a lot out of him.

1026
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:00,300
Like you can tell that he's pushing to get all this yelling going.

1027
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,300
His voice is-

1028
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,300
He's exhausted.

1029
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1030
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,300
This is difficult.

1031
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,300
Yeah.

1032
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,300
He's not a young man anymore.

1033
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,640
No, but you got to do it.

1034
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:19,520
We pray for President Donald John Trump in this incredibly serious moment.

1035
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,700
And we pray for all the women in America who the system's trying to lie to to kill their

1036
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,700
babies.

1037
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:31,500
And we say, don't kill your babies.

1038
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,780
The enemy has been forced out in the open.

1039
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,060
World government is here.

1040
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:42,900
And the system is publicly stealing this election from the biggest landslide and the biggest

1041
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,100
political realignment since 1776.

1042
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,660
I mean, just every single line.

1043
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:58,460
He knows how to frame a sentence in a way that will end with like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1044
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:03,180
Not in like a necessarily bad way, but like, you know, you see comedians who like, you

1045
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:08,580
know, structuring a line, you know, like, oh, what you're saying is funny, but the way

1046
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:12,260
you've written that or the way you're saying that is not funny.

1047
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,860
It doesn't lead people to the reaction that you're looking for.

1048
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:21,180
Whereas Alex, every single sentence that he's saying is specifically meant to make people

1049
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,060
yell at the end of it.

1050
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:29,220
And that's, I mean, don't do this in the middle of your event.

1051
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,940
I don't think it's a good idea.

1052
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,620
Like you're going to make everyone else look like trash.

1053
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,140
It's poor, it's poor quality.

1054
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,180
Just don't let him on your show at all.

1055
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:45,420
How is it that I could, I could run a better fucking rally just using the same principles

1056
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,940
of booking a show, a comedy show.

1057
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,140
I bet you, I bet you couldn't though, cause you'd have no idea who any of these people

1058
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,140
are.

1059
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,140
Oh, that's true.

1060
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,140
I wouldn't have them at my rally.

1061
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,540
You'd see a bunch of random names on a list like, what, I don't know what this person's

1062
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,540
like.

1063
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,540
I wonder if I could do that.

1064
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,540
That would be an interesting challenge.

1065
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,420
I'll take maybe 10 seconds of each of these people speaking and I'll see if I can't make

1066
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,420
a lineup out of them that would make more sense.

1067
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,820
That would be a great idea.

1068
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,820
Wouldn't that be a fun game?

1069
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,820
Yeah.

1070
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,820
Yeah.

1071
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,820
I might try and put that together.

1072
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:12,820
That'd be fun.

1073
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,820
All right.

1074
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:18,540
So anyway, the big problem that I see with all of this, and I'm going to keep stressing

1075
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:24,300
this, is the insistence on what you describe as like Christian nationalism and the idea

1076
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:30,220
that your God is the only real God and you know, like just imagining being someone who

1077
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:38,220
is not a, you know, a Christian of this stripe in the audience and think about how uncomfortable

1078
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,760
you'd be.

1079
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,420
Our God is the God of the universe.

1080
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:51,420
Our God is the God of strength and honor and will and God is in control and God is on our

1081
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,180
side.

1082
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:58,420
Because it's not like, it's the Jericho march and you know, there is a religious character

1083
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:03,700
to it, but it's also partnered with Ali Alexander in Stop the Steal and the Phyllis Schlafly

1084
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,700
Eagle Forum.

1085
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,500
You know, like it's not just, it's just, it's terrifying.

1086
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,660
I mean, everything that they're saying though is screaming out a different form of we cannot

1087
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,700
coexist.

1088
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,780
We will not accept coexisting.

1089
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,380
It's us or nothing.

1090
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,380
That's it.

1091
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,380
Yeah.

1092
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:25,900
There is a, and to be fair, so far the main speakers that we've heard are the MyPillowGuy

1093
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:26,900
and Alex.

1094
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,900
Sure.

1095
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:33,900
And it's not, you know, to be indicative of like everybody is unable to coexist.

1096
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,460
These voices that are being welcomed here are fucked.

1097
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,460
Yeah.

1098
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,660
I mean, but even then, like the best you could say for so many of these people would be like,

1099
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:47,340
Hey, hey, we can coexist so long as you stay under my boot, then we'll be fine.

1100
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,340
Yeah.

1101
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:53,760
So many people who have no idea about anything that has to do with the religion of Christianity

1102
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,420
think that the crucifixion was a bad thing.

1103
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,300
You know, like, Oh no, if only we could have stopped it.

1104
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,900
No, that's not how it works.

1105
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:02,900
No, no.

1106
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,900
It was almost like crucial.

1107
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,900
Yeah.

1108
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:10,860
No one really thinks that, you know, it was necessary for the atonement and it was almost

1109
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,540
preordained if you will.

1110
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,540
Yeah.

1111
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,300
So, but Alex also understands this.

1112
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,300
Okay.

1113
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,300
Good.

1114
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,460
He's not, he's not one of these guys who would have like tackled the Romans or something.

1115
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,860
So Judas is a good guy then.

1116
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:21,860
I don't know.

1117
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:22,860
Okay.

1118
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,900
Christ's crucifixion was not our defeat.

1119
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:30,340
It was our greatest victory.

1120
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:38,300
When he rose again on the third day, he broke the chains of hell and death.

1121
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,300
We have the deed to this planet.

1122
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:49,260
We have the deed to eternal life and we praise Jesus Christ and the father.

1123
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,260
Wow.

1124
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,260
That's scary.

1125
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,260
Yeah.

1126
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,260
That's terrifying.

1127
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,260
He has the deed to the planet.

1128
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,260
Yeah.

1129
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,620
I don't think that somebody could scream at me.

1130
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,620
No.

1131
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:01,580
So in this next clip, Alex gets into the first amendment and you know, stuff about like freedom

1132
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,220
of religion.

1133
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,860
But he's also gone too fast.

1134
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,220
He's, he's, he's burned a lot of gas.

1135
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,220
Yeah.

1136
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,220
He's, he's out of it.

1137
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,220
Yeah.

1138
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,220
And so he has a little trouble.

1139
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:18,080
Congress shall make no law, establishing the establishment of religion or prohibiting the

1140
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:25,540
free exercise thereof, all Congress shall make no law, respecting the establishment

1141
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,780
of religion or the free exercise thereof.

1142
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:34,020
Our forebearers did not have separation of church and state as they spin it.

1143
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:38,700
It means the state has no jurisdiction over any of us.

1144
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,700
That's not true.

1145
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:46,500
That's quite, quite an extension of the, uh, the, the state has no jurisdiction over any

1146
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,500
of us.

1147
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,860
I'm pretty sure they weren't, I'm pretty sure they weren't like Congress shall make no law

1148
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:57,220
respect with respect to the free exercise of religion.

1149
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,060
But what that actually means is Christians are free of laws.

1150
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,220
We get to live however we want to.

1151
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,220
Yeah.

1152
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:10,460
If you can just create an excuse that's religiously based in heavy quotes, then the state can't

1153
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,100
do anything like you can kill for your religion.

1154
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,100
Yeah.

1155
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,100
Yeah.

1156
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,100
I don't, uh, I don't know.

1157
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,060
I feel like that's what he's saying pretty much.

1158
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,060
Yeah.

1159
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:22,940
But also it's like these thoughts are not fleshed out.

1160
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,940
It's just yelling.

1161
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,940
Yeah.

1162
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,940
And they're there for people to scream.

1163
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:26,940
Hooray.

1164
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,940
Yeah, you bet.

1165
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:28,940
Yeah, you bet.

1166
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,700
And here was Alex's lightning rod that he put out in order to get attention.

1167
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,700
Okay.

1168
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:38,940
So I don't know who's going to the white house in 38 days, but I sure know this Joe Biden

1169
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:44,860
is a globalist and Joe Biden will be removed one way or another.

1170
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,860
Nice.

1171
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,180
Cause that was the clip that got the big amount of attention on the internet because people

1172
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,820
fairly accurately interpret that as a veiled threat towards Joe Biden.

1173
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:53,820
Oh, why is that?

1174
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:58,060
I get that response, but it's also exactly why Alex said what he said.

1175
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:01,780
It's almost certainly not legally actionable as a threat and if the secret service end

1176
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,980
up talking to him about it, that's even better.

1177
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,140
That's super cool for him.

1178
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,140
Yeah.

1179
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,140
Alex would love that.

1180
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,220
I got a visit from the secret service, so you know that what I said was powerful.

1181
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:11,220
Yup.

1182
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,220
They're scared of me.

1183
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,220
Yup.

1184
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,100
Honestly, when I heard that, I thought it was pretty tame for Alex.

1185
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:19,140
And considering how up in arms people were like, there are articles written about it.

1186
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,660
Like, yeah, I guess it takes on a slightly different character when he's yelling those

1187
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,440
things in front of a crowd who then cheer.

1188
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,580
But if you heard Alex say this and you think that's him crossing a line, all that means

1189
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,340
is that you never listened to it.

1190
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,340
Yeah.

1191
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:36,040
I was, I was going to say, I saw his name in the news and I was like, well, can't check

1192
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:42,020
on that, but if that's what it was for, Dan, I have surprising news for a lot of people.

1193
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,020
Yeah.

1194
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,300
And that line there is an attention trap.

1195
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,300
Yeah.

1196
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,820
That is a trap that people fall into.

1197
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,060
And I understand why they do.

1198
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:55,340
And I honestly don't know if the best thing to do is ignore it, but if you pay attention

1199
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,700
to it, that gives him free press.

1200
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:03,780
And that's why he implied on a stage that Biden would be removed one way or another.

1201
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,780
Right.

1202
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:10,360
I mean, I guess with Alex, the reality is he has nothing to back that thread up with

1203
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,740
at all.

1204
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:15,380
And all he gets from it is attention for making that threat.

1205
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:20,940
And you know, I understand why you'd be like, Hey, what the fuck is going on here?

1206
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:26,780
But at the same time, it's like, Alex is going, Alex makes money because he says stupid shit

1207
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,780
like that.

1208
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,980
And you go, Oh my God, no.

1209
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,700
And then we do it all in two months.

1210
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,700
Yeah.

1211
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,700
Yeah.

1212
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:33,700
I mean, that's kind of the theme of the show.

1213
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,100
Yeah.

1214
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:39,980
So Alex slows down a little bit and wants to talk about my man, G-dubs, George Washington.

1215
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:46,140
Oh, our, our great first president, we literally are here on his farm.

1216
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,260
That's where we're at.

1217
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:53,500
George Washington didn't want to be king and every serve two terms that set that precedent.

1218
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,500
He left.

1219
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,500
He was a very quiet man.

1220
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:59,820
I didn't talk about his beliefs when he was a Christian, but those that knew him privately

1221
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:03,420
knew, he knew God controlled battlefields.

1222
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,060
God controlled governments.

1223
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:12,780
God controls the games and all his success was because of his love of God.

1224
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:17,380
So this rally is being held on the national mall in Washington, DC, George Washington's

1225
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:21,880
farm is now a national landmark called Mount Vernon, which is about 16 miles South and

1226
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,880
in the state of Virginia.

1227
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,900
Nah, come on now.

1228
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,580
As for Washington's religious beliefs, that's actually a matter that even scholars in the

1229
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:30,500
field of George Washington studies aren't fully settled on.

1230
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,500
Yeah.

1231
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,500
Mostly because of what Alex brings up.

1232
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,220
He is correct, like Washington was really private about his beliefs.

1233
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:40,660
The point is Alex can make that claim about Washington knowing that God runs everything

1234
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:44,900
and all this and the seriousness of his beliefs, but Alex could never back that up.

1235
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,900
He could never prove that.

1236
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:47,900
Why would you?

1237
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,540
Yeah, you just make that claim and it's good.

1238
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:54,380
I mean, that's good for him because like, you know, even if he were talking to a Washington

1239
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:58,820
scholar, they would be able to tease out more nuance to his beliefs.

1240
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,580
They wouldn't be able to be like, you're lying.

1241
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,580
Yeah.

1242
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:07,580
I mean, looking at what they do with a guy who is alive and real and how they've created

1243
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:13,620
a false story for him, we have no chance of them not trying to claim the founding father

1244
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,220
said fucking whatever it is they want, you know?

1245
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,220
True.

1246
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,820
So Alex gets back to talking about how his God is the real God.

1247
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:20,820
Sure.

1248
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:26,740
So never forget, we worship the true God that created the universe and all of us.

1249
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:32,820
And the satanic globalist trying to take control of us and trying to play God are fallen and

1250
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:33,820
are failed.

1251
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:39,800
And we need to just keep our eyes on Christ and never back down and never surrender.

1252
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,940
Keep your eyes on Christ and away from politics.

1253
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:47,420
Like he said, you remember how he said that.

1254
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,500
Also get ready to overthrow the government.

1255
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,500
Yeah, exactly.

1256
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:55,400
I don't recall him being like, Hey, render unto Caesar what Caesar's cause we're going

1257
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,800
to fuck him up later.

1258
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,260
So you were making a joke about Jesus standing next to Alex on stage.

1259
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,260
He's not there.

1260
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,260
He's not there.

1261
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,260
But somebody is.

1262
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,260
And that's Owen Schroyer.

1263
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,260
Okay.

1264
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,260
Slight downgrade.

1265
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,260
A little bit down.

1266
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,260
A little bit down.

1267
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:13,340
Owen Schroyer is standing there on stage and Alex hands the mic off to him.

1268
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:14,340
Oh no.

1269
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,340
Now listen to this clip.

1270
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,340
Oh no, Owen.

1271
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:20,140
Listen to this clip of Alex saying, Oh, he's going to let Owen talk because it sounds like

1272
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,460
he's going to do a fucking ad.

1273
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,460
Okay.

1274
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,380
He doesn't, but it sounds like he's about to do an ad.

1275
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,140
I'm going to turn this over to my buddy for two minutes.

1276
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:34,020
My great co-hosted in full wars.com, Owen Schroyer, and then the next great, the next

1277
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:38,340
great guests are coming up here, but remember this, it really sounds like the next great

1278
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,340
guest.

1279
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,340
Yeah.

1280
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,660
It sounds like he's about to remember this self-prostate guard.

1281
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:48,060
We are having our Easter sale in December.

1282
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:52,540
So Alex finishes up his stuff before he ends off the baton to Owen.

1283
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,780
You know how 666 is the devil's number?

1284
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:56,780
Sure.

1285
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:57,780
Why not?

1286
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,780
1776.

1287
00:54:58,780 --> 00:54:59,780
That's God's number.

1288
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,780
Yeah.

1289
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,780
It doesn't sound right.

1290
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:06,860
God ordained this Republic to stand against the satanic empires, the Nazis and the communists

1291
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,420
and others.

1292
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:16,940
And so 1776 is God's number of victory over the satanic 1984.

1293
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:19,300
God bless you all.

1294
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,300
And I salute you.

1295
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,140
Thank you, Jesus.

1296
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,160
And that's, uh, that's Alex's speech.

1297
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,100
So important numbers to God.

1298
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,100
Yeah.

1299
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,100
He's a real numbers guy.

1300
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,100
Uh huh.

1301
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:33,380
1776 is God's number because the United States was ordained by God to stand up to Nazis.

1302
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:34,380
Yep.

1303
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,380
I remember that.

1304
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,580
There's a little complexity to that.

1305
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:37,580
Uh huh.

1306
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:41,820
I mean, so what happened then whenever we grabbed all their scientists and didn't, and

1307
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,620
then weren't like, Hey, could you guys quit being Nazi?

1308
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,980
And we're just like, eh, you guys are great.

1309
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:49,860
Can you phrase that question in number form?

1310
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,260
1944?

1311
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,620
So Owen, he's not great after that.

1312
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:56,620
Cause how could you be?

1313
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,620
Sure.

1314
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,540
I mean, Alex just yelled the applause line after applause line.

1315
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:04,380
He's worn out the audience for like excitement.

1316
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,580
So Owen, like this is so great.

1317
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,540
God, what a sad man.

1318
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:12,080
Boy, look at what we have here today.

1319
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:18,380
What started with one man on public access television is now millions of Americans in

1320
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,660
the streets of DC.

1321
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,660
So many problems.

1322
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,820
Started with one man on local access television.

1323
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:29,420
He's pretending that Alex did all of this.

1324
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,960
Like he created this entire event.

1325
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,760
They're only all there for him.

1326
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:37,260
And then he's also saying that there's millions of people there, which there are not.

1327
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,260
Oh boy.

1328
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,260
There are not.

1329
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,260
There are too many.

1330
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,260
Owen, Owen, Owen.

1331
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,260
Yeah.

1332
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,260
Oh boy.

1333
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,940
So we got to do a little admin at this point.

1334
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:50,260
Eric Metaxas comes out and he's got to maybe, you know, reset the room a little bit.

1335
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,620
People got a little bit too excited.

1336
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:55,580
It's like at the dance hall, the DJ can only play so many bangers in a row before you got

1337
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:59,220
to have one where everybody gets to sit down and maybe slow dance, you know, that kind

1338
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,220
of thing.

1339
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:04,100
I think people got too excited and they're whipping their flags all around and it's a

1340
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,100
problem.

1341
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,060
I've got a little housekeeping.

1342
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:11,700
They said to me that these flags in the front, when there, when there's a speaker, they're

1343
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:16,540
blocking the video and this is being live streamed all over the place.

1344
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:21,220
So if you could just drop the flags whenever the speaker is speaking or the prayer is praying,

1345
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,620
dropping them means taking them down.

1346
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:26,020
You probably don't realize the term drop means down with the flag.

1347
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,300
Could you do that?

1348
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,300
Flags is what is that?

1349
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,300
A Korean flag.

1350
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,780
Bring that down.

1351
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,780
What is that?

1352
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,780
A Kung Fu martial arts flag.

1353
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,780
Bring that down.

1354
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,780
Come on.

1355
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,780
Seriously.

1356
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,780
Cause we want everybody.

1357
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:37,780
There's a lot of people who couldn't be here.

1358
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:38,780
They're watching this on live stream.

1359
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,780
Yeah.

1360
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,820
Put these flags down.

1361
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:45,900
That's a weird, that's a weird little bit of just tossed off.

1362
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,180
I don't know what's going on.

1363
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,180
Yeah.

1364
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,180
Yeah.

1365
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,200
I don't know what that flag he's referring to is.

1366
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:57,940
And also there is a brown station wagon with its horns going off right now.

1367
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:58,940
Could somebody please?

1368
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:04,100
It's a brown station wagon license plate CE 9429.

1369
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,100
Yeah.

1370
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,980
So, uh, he gets, he gets these flags down right in time.

1371
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:14,220
For the man, the myth, Ali Alexander to come out and give a little bit of a speech.

1372
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:19,980
And he's, he's basically out here saying, Hey man, look, now is the time that moral

1373
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:25,660
people, moral people are deciding whether or not this presidency and this government

1374
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,300
itself is legit.

1375
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,300
Great.

1376
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,140
I think that we are making history.

1377
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:37,180
I think that today, today is when moral Americans are deciding whether our government is legitimate

1378
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,700
or illegitimate.

1379
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:44,520
I think that this is a signal to the deep state that we're not going to tolerate a Joe

1380
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,520
Biden presidency.

1381
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,180
I'm going to tolerate it.

1382
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,180
Yeah.

1383
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:52,220
So he's saying essentially that all of us are going to determine whether or not this

1384
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:56,900
is a legitimate government and the deciding thing will be whether or not Trump is installed

1385
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:57,900
again.

1386
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,620
And great.

1387
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,060
Ali is a little threatening.

1388
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:07,620
There's an interesting thing that I noticed through these two rallies.

1389
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:14,340
The one with the women for Trump is largely not about destroying the GOP.

1390
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:15,340
Sure.

1391
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,540
Ali is threatening the GOP.

1392
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,540
I like it.

1393
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:24,900
I don't know if every speaker here is interested in destroying the Republican party, but Ali,

1394
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:29,460
who's one of the organizers of this, is definitely open to that discussion.

1395
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,540
I think it's a great discussion to have.

1396
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:37,580
So not only will he destroy the GOP, he will also shut down all of the cities in this country.

1397
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,920
All of them, Ali.

1398
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,340
Our truckers will shut down the city.

1399
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,340
Unionize!

1400
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,340
Why isn't anybody clapping?

1401
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:50,860
We will build and occupy DC full of patriots here, won't we?

1402
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:57,260
We can do all things through Christ who strengthens us.

1403
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:02,340
So to my Republican colleagues, put down those flags so that they can stream.

1404
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,340
Please.

1405
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,340
Dude.

1406
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,340
Yes, you.

1407
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,340
Thank you.

1408
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:09,620
Really hung up on those flags.

1409
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:14,940
How can you want to be led by such whiners like these people?

1410
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:15,940
Very soft.

1411
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,660
They're such whiners.

1412
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:23,640
So Ali, he's gonna shut everything down and he's gonna do this with the help of cool media

1413
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,640
outlets.

1414
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,780
A few shout out to RSBN.

1415
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:28,780
Whoa.

1416
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:29,780
RSBN.

1417
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,660
And One American News.

1418
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,380
One American News.

1419
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,380
And Newsmax.

1420
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,380
Newsmax.

1421
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,460
That was loud.

1422
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:39,460
Epic Time.

1423
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,500
Epic Time.

1424
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,500
NTDTV.

1425
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:46,000
Never heard of it.

1426
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,500
We don't need Fox News anymore, do we?

1427
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,500
No.

1428
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,500
No Infowars.

1429
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:55,140
You just had Alex Jones up here.

1430
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:56,460
You basically work there.

1431
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,220
Why didn't you say Infowars?

1432
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:02,620
Alex's whole premise is like, no one will say Infowars because we're too dangerous.

1433
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,620
You have Ali Alexander.

1434
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:09,860
You guys won't say Infowars because you're too toxic.

1435
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,700
That is something that is very consistent.

1436
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,700
That is so funny.

1437
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:19,300
He is still on the outside, even with this completely wacky media landscape.

1438
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:23,460
So Ali is really thrilled about this guy named Mo Brooks, who apparently has come out, he's

1439
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:29,240
a member of Congress in the House, and he's said that, hey, look, even if the Electoral

1440
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:34,100
College comes back and says, hey, Biden's the president, I'm gonna object.

1441
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,980
You got it, man.

1442
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:36,980
You took him down.

1443
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,900
Ali is excited.

1444
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:42,860
Thank God for Congressman Mo Brooks.

1445
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:50,780
He has said that he will object to the House certification on January 6th.

1446
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:54,740
And we need some of his colleagues to join him, don't we?

1447
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:59,260
We expect them to join him, don't we?

1448
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:02,860
Or we will throw them out of office.

1449
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:03,860
Good luck.

1450
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:04,860
Yeah.

1451
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:05,940
But it doesn't stop there.

1452
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:10,180
The threats against the Republicans who don't support Mo Brooks.

1453
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,180
Threaten them.

1454
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:16,940
Let me tell the Republican Party that if one of these senators do not join Mo Brooks, we

1455
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:21,100
will burn the Republican Party down and we will make something new.

1456
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,100
Oh, no.

1457
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,100
Yeah, you're so threatening.

1458
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:34,820
I mean, look, I would say that that response is a little bit not good that we have.

1459
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:39,860
And that is because, like, well, in 2009, some of the similar rhetoric was flying around

1460
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:44,140
at early Tea Party rallies, and it would have been very easy to be like, yes, destroy the

1461
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:45,140
Republican Party.

1462
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:53,180
But you see that when that effort happens, it's not like it cripples the party.

1463
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:59,580
It ends up pushing extreme voices closer to the mainstream, or the mainstream goes towards

1464
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:04,020
the crazy voices, as is more often the case, and we end up where we are now.

1465
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:09,080
So I don't think that they're going to be capable of doing this, but encouraging this

1466
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:16,300
sort of inner GOP fighting, I don't know if it's great.

1467
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:23,100
Because it does also lead to the possibility of people like Ali or Nick Fuentes or Alex

1468
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:28,020
Jones coming into a more relevant position than they would be otherwise.

1469
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:34,260
I think you're right, presupposing that we do nothing, which is what happened with the

1470
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:35,300
Tea Party.

1471
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:41,060
We all sat by and laughed as they fought and we were like, ha ha ha, let them fight, instead

1472
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:48,700
of using this as an opportunity to sabotage both wings and fuck them up together.

1473
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:55,220
Like what we're doing is watching, like what they have done so successfully is constantly

1474
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:58,940
push a wedge between the left and the center and the Democratic Party.

1475
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:02,800
That's the best thing that the Republicans know how to do, is whenever there's the internecine

1476
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:08,020
squabbles from the Democrats, the Republicans jump in and start throwing shit at the wall

1477
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:12,740
too, to see if they can cause more conflagrations in between us.

1478
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:16,380
And every time this happens on the right, the Democrats look back and they're like,

1479
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:20,260
well, I bet the reasonable head shall prevail this time.

1480
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,260
And it's insane.

1481
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:26,500
Yeah, yeah, that does seem to be, I don't know, it's tough because I do want to laugh

1482
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,500
also.

1483
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,500
Yeah, me too, it's so funny.

1484
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:33,980
I'd like to find a way to use this as a politically useful moment, but also laugh.

1485
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:39,980
Well, I mean, I think the thing that, like I feel for these idiots kind of in a way,

1486
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,940
not the leaders, I mean the people at the rally.

1487
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:48,060
I feel for people's aunts and uncles and grandparents, like I feel for them.

1488
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:49,060
Sure.

1489
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,060
I don't feel for Ali.

1490
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,060
No, no, absolutely not.

1491
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:56,300
No, I mean the people in the rally, because they are being told, don't feel for Ali, feel

1492
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,300
for the rally.

1493
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,300
Yes.

1494
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:04,540
No, I mean the thing that I want to scream at all of these people is, look, if you want

1495
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:08,900
what they are telling you you want to get, then you have to start a shooting war.

1496
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,460
Those are your options.

1497
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:13,060
None of this shit that they're selling you is real.

1498
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:14,420
They're wasting your time.

1499
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:19,300
So if you really want to balls up, then start a shooting war or stop going to these dumb

1500
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,300
ass rallies.

1501
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:24,540
The people who are taking the rhetoric that you are digesting seriously are beating up

1502
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,820
people on the streets.

1503
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:26,820
Exactly.

1504
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:32,420
And that is the unfortunate reality of the rhetoric and what you are acclimating yourself

1505
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:33,420
to.

1506
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:34,420
Exactly.

1507
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:36,980
Yeah, that would be worthwhile for them to realize.

1508
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:44,060
And the fruition of specifically what this type of rally is about, you get your goals,

1509
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:47,120
you end up in a Christian theocracy.

1510
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:52,940
And I don't think that anybody, I don't think most people really actually want that.

1511
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:53,940
No.

1512
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:58,500
There's all those people who love Christianity and they're super religious, but then they

1513
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:01,420
get into those situations where they have to apply it and they're like, well, maybe

1514
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,860
not this time.

1515
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:03,860
You know what?

1516
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:07,220
I'm still a morally good person, but this time I'm not going to act in this way.

1517
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:10,300
You know, tonight I'm going to go out and get drunk and I'm going to have a really good

1518
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,300
night.

1519
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,840
And instead in a Christian theocracy, you're fucking killed for it.

1520
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:14,840
You know, like it's that kind of shit.

1521
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:20,420
Let's say you're a pastor and you marry, you know, you're already married and then you

1522
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:25,620
end up banging around with the secretary at your church and then, you know, I mean, under

1523
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:30,980
a Christian theocracy, you will not do as well as you do under a liberal republic.

1524
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:33,300
A little bit different.

1525
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:37,060
You know how rich Christians still seem to get all the abortions that they want to get?

1526
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,060
It is weird.

1527
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,060
It is weird.

1528
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:44,140
So Ali Alexander, he thinks he's a mastermind.

1529
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:49,660
And I got to say this next clip just sounds like he thinks he's a Bond villain and he's

1530
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:53,540
coming out to this, this rally and like, here is our grand plan.

1531
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:54,540
Oh boy.

1532
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:55,540
So he's role playing it.

1533
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:56,540
Yeah.

1534
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,540
Yeah.

1535
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:58,540
It's, it's a little cringy.

1536
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:03,340
So the plan in January is to start organizing y'all.

1537
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:07,740
We are going to go into the county parties, we are going to go into the district parties

1538
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:11,340
and we are going to go to the state conventions of the Republican party and we're taking over

1539
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:14,620
all 50 states.

1540
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:16,820
We are going to work with the Jericho march.

1541
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:18,700
We are going to work with Alex Jones.

1542
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:23,300
We are going to work with anyone who will work with us, aren't we?

1543
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:27,260
And let me just tell you how deep this goes cause I've been in this business for 14 years

1544
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:29,740
and finally the movement has a strategist.

1545
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:35,540
I sat across and I'm not going to say his name, a state party chair and I said, Hey

1546
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:37,180
buddy, we've known each other for 12 years.

1547
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,180
You're up for reelection in May.

1548
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,260
I'm going to flood your state convention.

1549
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:45,260
And then after we take over all of the positions, we're then going to call a quorum and then

1550
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:49,220
we're going to impeach the rest of the officers, aren't we?

1551
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:52,660
I'm a dangerous black man who knows Robert's rules of order.

1552
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:53,660
Wow.

1553
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:59,060
So the Republican party, I just want them to hear this message.

1554
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:01,300
Look at this crowd.

1555
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:07,280
We are the people that you must represent or we're going to replace you with Patriots.

1556
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,280
That's called voting.

1557
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:12,060
Yeah, I think he's basically, did he just discover voting?

1558
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:14,140
I think he discovered community organizing.

1559
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,140
I think so.

1560
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:20,240
The thing that they have decried the left doing hate it so much cause it's cheating.

1561
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,180
Focusing on local politics.

1562
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:23,180
Yeah.

1563
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:24,180
Yeah.

1564
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:26,180
Oh, scary.

1565
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:27,180
Yeah.

1566
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:30,300
See, this is why it's hard to take Alex's threat seriously.

1567
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:33,620
Like we're going to kill Joe Biden immediately following.

1568
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:41,180
Like what we're going to do is we're going to go, we're going to call a quorum for everyone.

1569
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:42,300
What are we talking about?

1570
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,180
I know Robert's rules of order.

1571
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:45,180
What?

1572
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:46,420
God damn it.

1573
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:47,420
I bet he doesn't.

1574
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:52,620
I'm going to, I'm going to follow Patton into battle if he gives a speech like Robert's

1575
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:56,620
rules of order are dangerous in the wrong hands.

1576
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:59,620
Patton is actually on my mind quite a bit throughout this.

1577
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:02,620
And I think it's probably because General Flynn, I watched him give the same speech

1578
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:03,620
twice.

1579
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:07,840
I just kept thinking like, this is not Patton.

1580
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:08,940
This is bad.

1581
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:09,940
That's what I keep hearing.

1582
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:13,340
When you hear nationalist propaganda, you want it to be Patton, right?

1583
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:18,180
Well, I mean, that's what Alex is trying to be and a lot of these people are just absolutely

1584
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:19,180
whiffing.

1585
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:20,180
Yeah, not good.

1586
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:27,580
Granted, they're still bad and scary, but anyway, Ali ends his speech by talking a little

1587
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,940
bit about how God is giving him science.

1588
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,660
This is upsetting.

1589
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:35,840
The last thing I'll say, and I'll probably be back up on stage later, is that we have

1590
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,740
God's favor.

1591
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:41,180
One day I'm going to tell you guys all the stories, but this, the sun coming out like

1592
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:44,380
this, this is God.

1593
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,220
He has gone ahead of us.

1594
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:51,660
I have been to 10 different states and it's not rained once.

1595
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:52,660
Get the fuck out.

1596
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:53,660
To God be the glory.

1597
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:54,660
Get the fuck out.

1598
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:55,660
No.

1599
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:56,660
No.

1600
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:57,660
I've been to...

1601
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,660
God damn it.

1602
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:04,580
Have you ever been to 10 states and it didn't rain once?

1603
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:05,580
Can you say that?

1604
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:06,580
I guess I can't.

1605
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:07,580
Ha.

1606
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:08,580
Or maybe I can.

1607
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,580
I don't know.

1608
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:10,580
Does flying count?

1609
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:13,060
I flew over 10 states and it didn't rain once.

1610
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,060
Does that count?

1611
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:15,060
Were you above the rain?

1612
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:16,620
What counts?

1613
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:19,300
God damn it.

1614
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:23,200
This is how I feel every time somebody tells me about ghosts.

1615
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,780
Every time somebody's like, oh, you don't believe in ghosts?

1616
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,780
I've got a ghost story.

1617
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:30,860
I'm like, tell me about how the sun shined for 10 states.

1618
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:31,860
Fuck you.

1619
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:32,860
It didn't rain.

1620
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:33,860
God, it's a ghost.

1621
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:34,860
Didn't rain.

1622
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:35,860
Didn't rain.

1623
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:36,860
Oh, ghosts are real.

1624
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:37,860
Sure.

1625
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:38,860
Didn't rain.

1626
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,860
Yeah, okay.

1627
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,260
I'm going to reverse Douglas Adams, rain god.

1628
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:43,400
Get the fuck out of here.

1629
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:50,020
So after Ali gets done, they have another speaker and this is a guy by the name of Leon

1630
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:51,020
Benjamin.

1631
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:52,020
Okay.

1632
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:54,820
Who is a bishop, but I should also tell you that this year...

1633
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:55,820
A bishop of what?

1634
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:56,820
Uh, at a church.

1635
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:57,820
Okay.

1636
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:01,300
This year, he also lost the race for the fourth district of Virginia seat in the house.

1637
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:02,300
Oh, that's a bummer.

1638
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,300
House of Representatives.

1639
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,300
That's a bummer.

1640
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:08,220
He also probably would have lost in the primary, like all the ding-dongs that we talk about

1641
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:13,860
on this show, but he ran unopposed until the general election, and then he lost by quite

1642
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:14,860
a margin.

1643
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:15,860
Quite a margin.

1644
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:16,860
Quite a margin.

1645
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:17,860
What are you saying?

1646
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:18,860
What are you saying?

1647
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:19,860
38 to 61, I think.

1648
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:20,860
38 to 61?

1649
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,260
That's not as big a margin as I would hope.

1650
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:23,260
No.

1651
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,260
It never is, is it, Dan?

1652
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:25,260
But it's still pretty big.

1653
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,300
Yeah, it is still pretty big, but it's never big enough.

1654
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,300
Yeah.

1655
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:37,300
So Eric Metaxas brings Bishop Leon Benjamin up, and man, I gotta say, I thought that maybe

1656
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:41,180
this was a racist event, but man, this cleared it up.

1657
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:49,340
I heard, I keep hearing that we're all racists, and yet every now and again, I bump into a

1658
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:50,960
black man at these events.

1659
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,580
What is happening?

1660
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:54,320
What is happening?

1661
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,320
Every now and again, is it?

1662
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,320
That's not supposed to be the narrative.

1663
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,320
What are you talking about?

1664
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:00,100
Aren't we supposed to be all about white nationalism?

1665
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:03,260
I keep reading that, and you're screwing that up.

1666
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:06,820
This is Bishop Leon Benjamin.

1667
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:13,300
He's got a shofar at the end of what he says he's gonna play the flight of the bumblebee.

1668
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,300
Don't miss it.

1669
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,300
Another bad joke.

1670
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,300
Wow.

1671
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:17,300
Yeah.

1672
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,300
Well, they're not racist.

1673
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,300
That's cool.

1674
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:20,300
Anyway, Leon-

1675
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,900
Did he just make a minstrel joke while saying he wasn't being racist?

1676
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,980
It might be on the cusp, I'm not entirely sure.

1677
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:30,500
So Leon is really into Christian nationalism.

1678
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,540
There are walls that must come down.

1679
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:33,540
This is history.

1680
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:37,280
This is December 12th, 12th, the number for government.

1681
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:40,660
That means a fresh anointing is about to come on this nation-

1682
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:41,660
That was the number for government?

1683
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:47,780
An anointing that we have never felt before, an anointing we have never seen before.

1684
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:57,180
Jesus is the lion of the tribe of Judah, and he will rule in America.

1685
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:58,180
Man.

1686
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:59,180
Man.

1687
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,180
Yeah.

1688
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:06,580
And the Nationalists just really miss out on a lot of great black preachers, you know?

1689
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,620
So it's nice that they get this one, but-

1690
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:11,260
Well, that's the advantage of Christian nationalism.

1691
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:12,260
I guess.

1692
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:17,780
Yeah, you still get a few good talkers here and there.

1693
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:23,940
So Jordan, I know that we've heard a lot about wee-etches over the course of the time of

1694
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:24,940
doing this show.

1695
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:25,940
They're fucking everywhere.

1696
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:26,940
It's true.

1697
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:31,540
They've not really gotten any good advice about what to do about them, or like-

1698
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:32,540
That's true.

1699
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:33,540
How do you talk to a wee-etch?

1700
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:35,380
How do you deal with wee-etches?

1701
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:39,480
This is what I learned about witchcraft.

1702
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,380
You gotta tell a witch, you gotta look them right in the eye and say, I'm coming after

1703
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:44,380
you.

1704
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:45,620
This is your last day.

1705
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:47,340
This is your last time.

1706
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:52,380
Every curse you cursed against our president and against our nation is gonna double fold

1707
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,220
back on your head.

1708
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:57,580
You have to be direct with witches, you understand?

1709
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:58,580
That's the advice.

1710
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:06,780
I just, I just, I'm just, all I'm thinking is Wizard of Oz, Dorothy wakes up, Glenda

1711
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:10,900
the Good Witch shows up and she's just like, you get the fuck out of my face!

1712
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,700
I will come and kill you!

1713
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:17,220
You listen to me, I'm going back to Kansas.

1714
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,220
That's how you deal with wee-etches.

1715
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,340
That's how you deal with witches.

1716
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:25,740
So Leon scares the hell out of me, quite frankly, because he says stuff like this.

1717
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:32,140
But when you shout, just understand, you're shouting for not only this generation, but

1718
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:35,780
you're shouting a legacy for the next generation.

1719
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:41,260
Because the demons we kill now, our children will not have to fight these devils!

1720
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:44,900
These are our devils, and we will kill them now!

1721
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:48,580
They will not fight our children!

1722
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:49,580
Just...

1723
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:50,580
Man!

1724
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:56,020
I understand that there's some, like, rhetorical license that you're not maybe intending to

1725
01:14:56,020 --> 01:15:02,620
talk about killing humans and your political enemies, but you're at a political rally,

1726
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:07,180
and you're talking about these demons and these devils that we're up against, and the

1727
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:12,540
conversation very easily, it could be understood as people who wear black and are, like, you

1728
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,100
think they're an antifa?

1729
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:16,460
Maybe someone at a Black Lives Matter rally?

1730
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:19,380
Maybe these are the demons that you don't want your children to have to fight.

1731
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:22,380
Everyone you get rid of is one your children doesn't have to fight.

1732
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:28,220
Right, I don't think that, you know, you could make a legally reasonable case that this is

1733
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:33,980
somebody threatening or inciting people to kill other people, but it's reckless.

1734
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:38,580
It's recklessly expressed ideas, and I can't...

1735
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:45,380
That's a great speech if it's 1977 and you're talking about climate change.

1736
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:50,860
Every bit of greenhouse gas that we get rid of is one that our kids don't have to deal

1737
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:51,860
with.

1738
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:52,860
Exactly.

1739
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:53,860
If you kind of put it that way...

1740
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:54,860
Then it makes great sense.

1741
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:56,100
It's a good thing to do, in fact.

1742
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:57,100
Somewhat.

1743
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:58,100
Yeah.

1744
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:06,100
So Alex Jones gave his speech, and then a little video came out of him backstage as

1745
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,780
he ran into General Flynn.

1746
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:09,900
And this is really, really funny.

1747
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:10,900
I had some words.

1748
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:14,700
I recommend people go find this video, since we're an audio podcast, I'll play the audio

1749
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,620
and then I'll explain what happened.

1750
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:19,180
Crazy day, huh?

1751
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:21,180
It isn't crazy.

1752
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:23,180
Are you scared?

1753
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,180
We're gonna win.

1754
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,180
What?

1755
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:29,180
You don't want me to get scared?

1756
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:31,260
You guys are funny, man.

1757
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:34,580
General Flynn did not want to talk to Alex at all.

1758
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:35,700
I don't know why!

1759
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:40,140
Alex comes up and he's like, crazy day, and General Flynn does not turn to him.

1760
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:43,460
He kind of like turns his head, but not his body, and he's like, yeah, it is a crazy day.

1761
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:45,780
He's like, ah, we're gonna win.

1762
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:47,780
And then he's like, are you scared?

1763
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:48,780
You scared?

1764
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:49,780
And Flynn's like, what?

1765
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:52,460
He's like, are you scared to shake my hand?

1766
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:58,340
And then Alex kind of gets this like, someone else kind of walks up and Alex gets the sense

1767
01:16:58,340 --> 01:16:59,340
of like, I gotta leave.

1768
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:00,340
Oh, wow.

1769
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:01,340
And so he walks off.

1770
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:06,980
And the camera pans over and Owen Troyer's standing a ways back.

1771
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:10,780
So there's the reveal of Owen Troyer, just in the corner watching?

1772
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:14,460
Yeah, like keeping his distance because he knows like, oh, this isn't gonna go well.

1773
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:15,460
This isn't for me.

1774
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:16,980
I'm not supposed to be there.

1775
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:21,220
And then Alex tries to save face with like, ah, you guys are funny.

1776
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:26,580
No, Flynn either knows who you are and doesn't want to be associated with you or has no idea

1777
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:27,580
who you are.

1778
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:28,580
Oh, man.

1779
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:30,180
Either way, it does not work well for his brand.

1780
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:35,340
Yeah, you should not meet your heroes that you created fictional versions of, assuming

1781
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:37,500
that the fictional version will greet you warmly.

1782
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,500
Yeah.

1783
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,500
Yeah, it's an issue.

1784
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:47,620
So Flynn, he gives a speech, gets up at this Jericho rally, and man, what a fucking beginning

1785
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:48,620
to this speech.

1786
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:49,620
Just awe-inspiring.

1787
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:57,180
You know, I was gonna end with a prayer, but maybe we'll start with a prayer.

1788
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:58,460
This sounds planned.

1789
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:03,500
I told Mike Lindell as he was walking and we bumped into each other, I actually had

1790
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,540
the first good sleep of my life last night.

1791
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:12,340
So mypillow.com, I'll give him a commercial.

1792
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:16,260
Mike fucking Flynn starts a speech with a plug for MyPillow.

1793
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:19,260
Oh my God.

1794
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:23,420
He must be throwing around cash at MyPillow guy.

1795
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:29,940
On this, our safe Christmas day, I must remind you, we happy few.

1796
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:33,260
How much fucking money is that guy making?

1797
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:35,860
There is a 5% discount.

1798
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:36,860
Did he find...

1799
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:39,660
On straw beds when we return home heroes!

1800
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:46,420
Did he find like a cache of Krugerands or something, like he find pirate gold?

1801
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:49,620
How is he throwing around all this money at a pillow company?

1802
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:52,780
I don't know, but Flynn's got that pillow cache.

1803
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:53,780
God.

1804
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:58,460
Anyway, so I know in Dune, I know people love Dune Talk, right?

1805
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,220
People love Dune Talk.

1806
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:02,900
They love it.

1807
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,740
Fear is the mind killer.

1808
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:05,740
Fear is the mind killer.

1809
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:06,740
Is that correct?

1810
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:07,740
That is correct.

1811
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:08,740
You tell me a little bit about this.

1812
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:09,740
Fear is the mind killer.

1813
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:13,220
It is the little death that, man, now that I'm on the...

1814
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,660
No, the petite moor is an orgasm.

1815
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:15,920
No, no, no.

1816
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:16,920
Fear is the...

1817
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,980
No, it's part of the litany against fear, Dan.

1818
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:19,980
Oh.

1819
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:21,980
It's something that the Bene Gesserit teach you to say whenever you're afraid.

1820
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,980
Does this have anything to do with Muad'Dib?

1821
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:28,020
Muad'Dib did learn the litany against fear and used it many a time in order to calm himself

1822
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:29,700
and bring himself into a more stable state.

1823
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:32,260
How does this relate to Duncan, Idaho?

1824
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:34,720
Duncan, Idaho learned the litany against fear.

1825
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:40,500
His mother was a Bene Gesserit, and so he was aware of all of that stuff.

1826
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,740
However, he was never trained in the ways of the Bene Gesserit because men children

1827
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:44,740
were not allowed.

1828
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:49,700
Only the Kwisatz Haderach, Dan.

1829
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:51,900
And were sandworms Bene Gesserits?

1830
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:52,900
Yes.

1831
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:55,020
Sandworms are not Bene Gesserits.

1832
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:57,740
They were actually God himself, Shai-Hulud.

1833
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:59,060
Fear is the mind killer.

1834
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:00,060
Fear is the mind killer.

1835
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:01,740
Sandworm, body killer.

1836
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:04,020
Sandworms kill everybody, but they are also God.

1837
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:06,660
They are also the devil, Shaitan.

1838
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:12,820
I wanted to discuss this a little bit because as Mike Flynn was talking, I was like, are

1839
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:14,200
you going to get into fear?

1840
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,200
He's talking about fear.

1841
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:18,180
I was like, oh, is he going to say that fear is the mind killer?

1842
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,180
He's very close.

1843
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:20,180
This is very close.

1844
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:21,180
I want him to do it.

1845
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:29,060
In our minds, in our minds, that's where we find fear because fear is a mental thing.

1846
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:33,740
It's something that you have in your minds and you fear things because your mind says,

1847
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:36,220
I'm afraid of that or I'm afraid of this.

1848
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:38,040
But it's in our hearts.

1849
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:42,900
It's in our hearts where we truly know what is right.

1850
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:48,900
Because in our hearts, that's where we differentiate between good and bad, right?

1851
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:53,060
Where we differentiate between darkness and light.

1852
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:54,060
And we know that.

1853
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:55,380
We know that in our heart.

1854
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:58,400
It's that gut feeling, but it's actually your heart.

1855
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,080
It's your heart talking to you.

1856
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:04,020
Not in your mind because your mind is going to say, I'm afraid.

1857
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:05,740
So fear is the mind killer.

1858
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:09,780
Trust your gut because your weird feelings are actually your heart, which is clearer

1859
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:11,540
because your heart is free of fear.

1860
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:18,540
The only thing we have to fear is fear because it comes from inside you, but it's also part

1861
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:22,260
of your heart and you can't listen to it, but it's not part of your heart because it's

1862
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:24,560
what you're afraid of and it's in your head.

1863
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,060
And fear is what we fear the most itself.

1864
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:29,060
Yeah.

1865
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:31,500
And it's a pattern.

1866
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,500
Yeah.

1867
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,380
A lot of great speakers in history.

1868
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:36,380
Not one of them.

1869
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:37,380
No.

1870
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:42,820
I realized as he was speaking that I don't think I've ever heard a full speech of his.

1871
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:43,820
Me neither.

1872
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:44,980
And I found it underwhelming.

1873
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:47,860
I found that to be incredibly terrible.

1874
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:50,860
So one thing I'm afraid of is helicopters.

1875
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:53,020
That's not actually true, but it's a good segue.

1876
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:54,020
Nice.

1877
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:55,660
One thing I'm afraid of is Segues.

1878
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,500
Well, we're both terrified.

1879
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:00,140
While Flynn is on stage, that's when the flyover happens.

1880
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:00,780
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1881
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:04,300
And this is just depressing.

1882
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,420
Imagine being able to just jump in a helicopter

1883
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:08,420
and go for a joy ride around Washington, DC.

1884
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:08,900
I love it.

1885
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:11,060
I love the fact that he does that.

1886
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:14,620
That's what he does, because he knows

1887
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:17,500
that the people that he can trust

1888
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,460
are people that he's never met.

1889
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:21,400
And that's you.

1890
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,660
I mean, he's never met.

1891
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:26,700
Look at the millions and millions of people, right?

1892
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:27,580
He trusts you.

1893
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:31,500
He trusts you because he knows you know what's going on,

1894
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,180
and you will not allow what's happening

1895
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:34,300
to happen in our country.

1896
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:35,440
None of us will.

1897
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,640
It's just not going to happen.

1898
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:39,240
I will tell you one more time, because I've been asked,

1899
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,940
on a scale of 1 to 10, who will be the next president

1900
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:47,460
of the United States, and I say Donald Trump, 10, a 10.

1901
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:50,820
You know, that moment there where he's like, first of all,

1902
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:53,660
the idea that Trump can trust you people who he doesn't know

1903
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:54,500
is very sad.

1904
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,460
So sad.

1905
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:58,340
But when Flynn is like, he trusts you because you're

1906
01:22:58,340 --> 01:22:59,740
the ones who know what's going on,

1907
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:01,980
you're not going to allow what's happening to happen,

1908
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:04,260
makes me think of that Andy Daly character, who's

1909
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:07,500
like the stand-up comic who says nothing.

1910
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:08,740
Like, what else is in the news?

1911
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:09,540
Can you believe this?

1912
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:10,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1913
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:11,420
Another?

1914
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:12,940
I mean, come on.

1915
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:14,500
What is going on with one of these?

1916
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:15,300
What's with this?

1917
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:16,300
Come on.

1918
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,340
I mean, not when I was.

1919
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:20,460
Not if I have anything to say about it.

1920
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:23,420
When this goes down, oh boy.

1921
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:24,380
Yeah.

1922
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:27,180
Trump trusts you because you know what's going on

1923
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:29,300
and you're not going to let what happens happen.

1924
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:29,780
Wow.

1925
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:32,860
Just fucking say that you wanted everyone

1926
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:36,540
to incite an installing of an unelected president.

1927
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:39,300
It just punctures so much of that.

1928
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:43,620
Like, it is one of those things that you don't really,

1929
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:45,620
it doesn't always hit you until it does.

1930
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:47,260
Like, how much you've been fucked up

1931
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:50,140
by movies and TV and culture and all that shit.

1932
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:55,460
Because you just hear General and you

1933
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:59,580
like see his military record and all of these war,

1934
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:00,540
like all of this shit.

1935
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:02,580
And he rose to this high rank and you're like,

1936
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:04,460
that's the fucking guy?

1937
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:08,420
Yeah, you kind of think of no-nonsense, stern sort

1938
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:13,140
of men-a-few-words, stiff upper lip kind of, yeah.

1939
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,420
And that's not the vibe Flynn gives.

1940
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:17,740
Actually, he's the brown-nosing toady

1941
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:21,660
who politicked his way up into the military, high ranks.

1942
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:22,620
He's a fucking dick.

1943
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:24,620
There's another guy who's like from Vets

1944
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:27,500
for Trump who gives a speech that is fairly uneventful

1945
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,860
and I don't have any clips of it.

1946
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:31,180
But he was far more like what you're talking about,

1947
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:32,060
what you would expect.

1948
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:34,500
Like a guy who's like, oh, you're terrified.

1949
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're dark.

1950
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:37,220
You're dark.

1951
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:38,220
Yeah, you're a dark man.

1952
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:39,740
You seem like an archetype of someone

1953
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:42,740
who's seen some shit.

1954
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:47,700
So this, I got to say, the Jericho rally drags at this point.

1955
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:48,300
I believe it.

1956
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,500
And I'm done with it.

1957
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,300
We're not going to talk about any more of it

1958
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,620
because it just ends up deteriorating into a thing

1959
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:56,060
where like there's a guy from Bikers for Trump

1960
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:59,620
and he ends up talking about how they formed this group, right?

1961
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:02,020
They formed this group because they wanted to stop Antifa

1962
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:04,860
from throwing dog poop at Trump supporters who are waiting

1963
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:05,980
in line to get into events.

1964
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,980
You said that in front of people.

1965
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:10,060
Yeah, he said that in an interview on the TV.

1966
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:10,660
Wow.

1967
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:12,820
There's also some more religious weirdos.

1968
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:16,980
And you know, I just, I lost it.

1969
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:17,980
I couldn't.

1970
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:20,380
I mean, there was also a couple other Infowars characters,

1971
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:22,620
but they were like kind of really adjacent people.

1972
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:25,100
Like Jason Jones, the guy who hosts The Fourth Hour

1973
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:29,540
sometimes, like he was there and he gave an interview.

1974
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:32,300
It was just kind of like, this is too much.

1975
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:36,100
And again, I think the problem is that Alex was kind of early.

1976
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:36,620
Yeah.

1977
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:39,220
It really took so much steam out of him.

1978
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,660
None of these other people could reach the heights of that.

1979
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:45,140
Like, you know, I don't know of any actual comedian who

1980
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,460
talks about laughs per minute, but I've heard the idea

1981
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:49,340
discussed.

1982
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:53,140
And applause lines per minute, Alex just wrecked shop.

1983
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:56,140
Like no one is going to be able to recover from that.

1984
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:57,060
He scorched earth it.

1985
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:58,100
Yeah, yeah.

1986
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:59,980
And so I.

1987
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:02,300
Which I imagine he did on purpose, honestly.

1988
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:02,700
Yeah.

1989
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:05,300
Because I've been under, I've been

1990
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:08,380
put where I wasn't supposed to go in the lineup before.

1991
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:11,660
And I made it very clear I wasn't supposed to go there.

1992
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:12,140
Yeah.

1993
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:12,500
You know?

1994
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:12,980
Yeah.

1995
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:14,940
I'm going to bury whoever comes up next.

1996
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:17,100
I'm going to bury your headliners so far

1997
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:17,900
into the ground.

1998
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:18,860
It's going to be brutal.

1999
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:21,780
It's also notable that Alex and Mike Flynn

2000
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:24,700
both come out to the Mission Impossible theme.

2001
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:28,300
Like Alex might have stolen Mike Flynn's intro music.

2002
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:31,100
Now that's some petty shit that I'm here for.

2003
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:31,620
Yes.

2004
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:33,340
I am here for that pettiness all day.

2005
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:36,140
I think there might be something there.

2006
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:40,940
So I watched a bunch more of this.

2007
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:42,820
But I lost my patience for it.

2008
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:45,500
Because I mean like how much, what else are we going to find?

2009
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,260
More examples of people saying the exact same Christian

2010
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:49,540
nationalist shit?

2011
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:50,060
Who cares?

2012
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:51,620
God, kill everybody.

2013
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:52,180
We got it.

2014
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:52,740
Moving on.

2015
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:55,700
But there was another rally that day.

2016
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:59,300
And this was the Women for America First rally.

2017
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:02,740
This was being held pretty close nearby around the same time.

2018
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:04,780
There's some particularly fun footage also

2019
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:06,540
that's going around on Twitter, which

2020
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:10,140
is of Alex trying to bum rush the stage at the Women

2021
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:11,060
for Trump rally.

2022
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:14,780
That sounds like a metaphor I'm able to understand clearly.

2023
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:15,940
Very unsuccessful.

2024
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:35,740
Maybe I just got a little enthusiastic, but we're going to do it, because Trump won't stop coming.

2025
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:42,740
We're not allowed to be here, we're not allowed to be here.

2026
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:51,420
Yes, yes, that is how you get escorted out.

2027
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:19,080
This is a family show, Alex.

2028
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:24,360
My first thought when I watched that was that Alex seems like he's on stimulants.

2029
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,580
He seems amped the fuck up.

2030
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:27,580
Red eyes.

2031
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:32,340
Yeah, and like grinding his mouth and like ready to fight with a security guard who won't

2032
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,340
let him through.

2033
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:34,340
Yeah.

2034
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:38,520
Feels like he clearly thinks he's entitled to get up there and get on stage at an event

2035
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:42,360
where the security guard is like, you're not welcome here.

2036
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:47,760
But I think about it and I'm like, well, honestly, he probably is coming over there right after

2037
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,300
he yelled at the other crowd.

2038
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:51,140
I would assume he was, he thought he was welcome.

2039
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:54,220
He's probably jacked as fuck off the adrenaline of that.

2040
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:55,220
Totally.

2041
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:56,220
Maybe also some stimulants, who knows.

2042
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:57,220
Yeah, why not?

2043
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:58,220
He's an older man.

2044
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:04,060
Yeah, so there, he got shut down from going to the Women for America First rally and you

2045
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:09,420
can tell that that's that rally because you can hear the guy in the background talking

2046
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:14,780
about the March for Trump, which was the bus tour that led to and culminated with this

2047
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:18,100
Women for Trump America First rally.

2048
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:21,540
I didn't hear him whining about flags either, so I assumed it was a...

2049
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:22,540
Wait for it.

2050
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:23,980
Oh no!

2051
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:31,020
So this rally was a much, it's much less relevant to our focus since there's less direct Infowars

2052
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:32,020
connections.

2053
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:36,740
Alex wasn't allowed at this one, he was allowed at the other show and they even let Owen Schroyer

2054
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:37,740
on stage.

2055
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:38,740
Yeah, that's weird.

2056
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:41,980
Alexander was one of the organizers of the Jericho rally and like I said, there were

2057
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:45,720
a couple other Infowars people that you could find hanging around.

2058
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:49,340
In contrast, this Women for America First rally felt like people who were a bit more

2059
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:51,700
interested in being taken seriously.

2060
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:56,100
The thing that I take issue with is that I can only find two real differences between

2061
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,100
them.

2062
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:01,580
One is that Alex was not allowed at the Women for America First one and they also seem to

2063
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:06,220
mention political issues a little more than the Jericho one.

2064
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:10,460
That was pretty solidly focused on demanding Christian nationalism, whereas this one is

2065
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:13,720
hiding a little bit in conservative politics.

2066
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:17,460
Big difference between the middle and far right wings of the Republican party.

2067
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:22,860
And desperately trying to appear somewhat credible with their booking choices.

2068
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:26,380
So they have like Katrina Pearson and Seb Gorka.

2069
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:28,260
Yes, very credible.

2070
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:29,260
Well, comparatively.

2071
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:31,140
Yeah, well I mean I guess.

2072
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:33,020
I guess they're bigger names maybe?

2073
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:36,940
Like Sebastian Gorka has a show that's syndicated.

2074
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:37,940
Okay that's fair.

2075
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:40,020
Alex is on Genesis Communications.

2076
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:43,600
Still amazing to me that Seb Gorka is just allowed to roam free.

2077
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:44,600
It is.

2078
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:48,420
And, shockingly, I texted you about this last night while I was.

2079
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:50,740
I texted you that he seems like a character.

2080
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:52,940
Like a sketch character.

2081
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:56,860
Like I had not also heard much Sebastian Gorka.

2082
01:30:56,860 --> 01:31:01,980
Except for maybe like little clips or honestly a Domian doing an impression of him.

2083
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:02,980
Yeah.

2084
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:03,980
But you've played for me.

2085
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:04,980
Way less.

2086
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:09,780
I honestly felt like watching that, I was like Sebastian Gorka's leaning into the bit.

2087
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:16,180
It felt like he was becoming the parodies of himself.

2088
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:17,180
That sounds right.

2089
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:22,900
Or maybe the parodies are just that good that like they really nail it because he seems

2090
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,700
like a farce of a person.

2091
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:25,700
Yeah.

2092
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:33,380
Like whenever your front lines are run by a hair dye bleeding Rudy Giuliani in front

2093
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:34,900
of a landscaping company.

2094
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:35,900
Hey man.

2095
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:39,260
Your parodies are gonna be just straight impressions.

2096
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:41,500
Rudy's the guy who hits the barbed wire.

2097
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:48,140
So Jordan, I originally intended that we would cover the entire rally of the Women for America

2098
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:49,140
first.

2099
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:50,140
Sure.

2100
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:51,140
Just like the Jericho one.

2101
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:52,140
Yeah.

2102
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,660
But the more I thought about it, the less that seemed compatible with my goal of creating

2103
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:56,700
a decent show that people can enjoy.

2104
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:59,500
Yeah, we could have just done rallies that were terrible.

2105
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:04,420
Mike Flynn and the My Pillow guy basically give the exact same speeches at both rallies

2106
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:09,060
and the whole thing just drags on way too long much like the other one with people just

2107
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,300
basically saying nothing.

2108
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:11,300
Yeah.

2109
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:12,820
Like it's really, it's really vapid.

2110
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:14,740
Well it has to be.

2111
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:15,740
Yeah.

2112
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,740
They have no actual substance.

2113
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:20,580
It's mostly getting people to chant about loving Trump and you know, whatever.

2114
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:23,340
Yeah, it's fucking straight up Nazi shit.

2115
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:28,500
I decided that possibly a better way to approach the Women for America First rally was to hand

2116
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,460
out some awards, some superlatives.

2117
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:31,460
Okay.

2118
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:35,660
As if this lineup was a bunch of matriculating, graduating seniors in high school.

2119
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:36,660
Love it.

2120
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:40,220
So the first, the first title I'd like to bestow on someone is...

2121
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:41,700
Most likely to secede?

2122
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:42,700
No.

2123
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:43,700
Hey.

2124
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:44,700
Not bad.

2125
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:45,700
Not bad.

2126
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:46,700
All of them.

2127
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:47,700
All right.

2128
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:48,700
Most confusing breath of fresh air.

2129
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:49,700
Okay.

2130
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:50,700
What's up DC?

2131
01:32:50,700 --> 01:33:00,940
How was General Flynn you guys, was that amazing or what?

2132
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:09,460
That man and his family have laid it on the line for our country over and over and over

2133
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:13,380
again and we can't show them enough gratitude.

2134
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:15,540
This guy is very clearly drunk.

2135
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:16,540
Yeah.

2136
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:21,620
He used to be in his late 30s, early 40s and is wearing what appears to be a red sequined

2137
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:22,620
smoking jacket.

2138
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:24,100
All right, now I like him.

2139
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,220
Now I'm back on board.

2140
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:26,260
He's got a beard.

2141
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:31,940
He seems fucking day drunk at like noon or one.

2142
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,780
There but for the grace of God go I, Dan.

2143
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:39,500
He is absolutely out of place at this rally and as the kids say, I was here for it.

2144
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:42,340
Also, I have no idea who he is.

2145
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:43,340
He never says his name.

2146
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:44,340
Yes.

2147
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:45,340
No one says his name.

2148
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:46,340
Yes.

2149
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:47,340
I don't know who he is.

2150
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:48,780
I tried to find out.

2151
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:49,780
I could not find out.

2152
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:51,860
I looked at the comments of the YouTube video.

2153
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:54,180
I Googled lineup of event.

2154
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:55,180
I couldn't find it.

2155
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:58,940
He was standing next to Alex when the security guard stopped him and he was like, I'm going

2156
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:00,580
to go all through then.

2157
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:05,320
But unfortunately, like all things we discuss on this show that are kind of fun, he ended

2158
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:09,780
up revealing himself to be a piece of shit, but also in the same clip that he says something

2159
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:12,140
that I was really tickled by.

2160
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:14,620
There's three parts to my message.

2161
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:19,220
I'm alarmed I lost all my guns, a tragic boating accident.

2162
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:20,220
What?

2163
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:21,220
What just happened?

2164
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:22,220
You guys have been.

2165
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:24,820
What did you just say to me?

2166
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:25,820
Second part.

2167
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:26,820
No, you stop about that.

2168
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:30,220
I want to know the first part of the ability.

2169
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:32,860
Something that we have to deal a lot with with the Kung flu.

2170
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:34,860
Oh, come on.

2171
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:35,860
Damn it, man.

2172
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:36,860
Disappointing.

2173
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:38,020
Oh, we were doing so good.

2174
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:39,940
We even got tragic boating accident.

2175
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:41,060
I wasn't expecting that.

2176
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:43,580
I'm not sure if that is a joke.

2177
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:48,340
Or if he actually had a boating accident and lost his guns.

2178
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:50,100
Why would you say tragic boating accident?

2179
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,260
That seems specific.

2180
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:57,020
It's either pretty funny as a joke, like I don't have any guns, I lost them in a tragic

2181
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,020
boating accident.

2182
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:00,140
See, now that's something that I would toss off if I was emceeing somewhere.

2183
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:02,540
I'd just be like, ah, I lost them in a tragic boating accident.

2184
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:03,540
Everybody moves on.

2185
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:05,060
Yeah, not a bad throwaway line.

2186
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:06,500
Yeah, a little toss.

2187
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,540
Also could be real, and I want to know the story.

2188
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:09,540
It could be real.

2189
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:14,700
Why was he specifically just telling me that he lost all of his guns in a tragic boating

2190
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:15,700
accident?

2191
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:17,460
Either way, I find him to be an engaging presence.

2192
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:23,380
He's got this weird red sequence-smoking jacket and he's fucked up.

2193
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:26,280
Why did you have to say that fucking racist flu stuff?

2194
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:33,780
It's a little bit like a racist right-winger played by Kyle Kinane, you know?

2195
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:36,140
I had no idea what is going on.

2196
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:37,380
I don't know who he is.

2197
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:39,460
He doesn't introduce himself.

2198
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:40,740
No one says.

2199
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:43,740
He's on the TV stream of it.

2200
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:45,640
There's no name on the chyron.

2201
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:46,640
No idea.

2202
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:47,640
He might have just shown up.

2203
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:48,820
He might have just wandered on there.

2204
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:49,820
I have no idea.

2205
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:55,260
But while he's on stage, he introduces a person who has the same name as a big celebrity,

2206
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:57,600
but does not appear to be that celebrity.

2207
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:03,900
You will never stand for it, and we're going to keep coming back until it's known, and

2208
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:10,180
our president, the greatest president ever, is where he's supposed to be.

2209
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:12,740
I fucking love this guy.

2210
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:13,740
He's great.

2211
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:16,140
I made sure this was an amazing woman.

2212
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:18,020
I told her I'd keep it brief.

2213
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:19,700
I don't want to get in trouble.

2214
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:24,980
So Jennifer Lawrence, come up and talk to everybody.

2215
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:28,860
It is not Jennifer Lawrence.

2216
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:31,660
I don't know who this Jennifer Lawrence is either.

2217
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:36,340
I thought maybe if I figured out who she is, it would help me find out who he is, and it

2218
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:37,340
did not.

2219
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:38,820
I still have no idea who anybody is.

2220
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:43,340
Is this like when that couple crashed a White House party and everybody was like, holy shit,

2221
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:44,340
how did they get in there?

2222
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:46,660
If it is, I love it.

2223
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:49,780
So Jennifer Lawrence is unfortunately a Christian nationalist.

2224
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:50,780
Well, that sounds-

2225
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:55,740
Those people on that hill over there need to remember that they work for us.

2226
01:36:55,740 --> 01:37:00,260
We the people, we don't work for them.

2227
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:04,500
We answer to God, not government, and God is going to tell us who's going to be the

2228
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:09,060
president, and God is going to tell us how this country is going to go, and we are going

2229
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:10,060
to fight.

2230
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:11,060
Okay.

2231
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:12,060
Thank you, Jennifer Lawrence.

2232
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:19,460
So then even if you get your president, you're still not going to do what the government

2233
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:20,460
says?

2234
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:21,460
I guess not.

2235
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:25,340
Anyway, congratulations to clearly day drunk guy in a sequined smoking jacket.

2236
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:30,460
You have won the very coveted title of most confusing breath of fresh air at that rally.

2237
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:37,020
I was a little bit hoping that somebody out of... What if JB Smoove did five minutes?

2238
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:41,060
That's what I was hoping the super surprising confusing breath of fresh air was.

2239
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:44,520
No, it's day drunk guy in a sequined red coat.

2240
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:45,980
Pretty close to JB Smoove.

2241
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:46,980
Yeah.

2242
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:50,860
So the next award that I'm going to give out, the next superlative, is the best integration

2243
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:53,740
of promotional messaging into a stump speech.

2244
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:55,380
My pillow, my pillow.

2245
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:56,380
Nope.

2246
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:57,380
Oh.

2247
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:58,380
Well, my pillow might be involved.

2248
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:59,380
Okay.

2249
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:06,180
But this award goes to radio show host David J. Harris, and let me say, it's not even close.

2250
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:07,180
Okay.

2251
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:08,180
All right.

2252
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:09,180
He ran away with this thing.

2253
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:10,180
Okay.

2254
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:15,220
And a special thank you to the co-sponsor that really helped fund a lot of this, Mr.

2255
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:21,940
My Pillow himself, Mike Lindell.

2256
01:38:21,940 --> 01:38:27,260
Amazing patriot, loves this country, loves us, loves the president, and the president

2257
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:28,260
loves him.

2258
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:30,540
And I got to tell you, I love his codes, right?

2259
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:36,460
I love his pillows, I love his sheets, I love his mattress topper, and I love his codes

2260
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:37,460
because you know what?

2261
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:38,460
The Kraken has been released.

2262
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:42,620
You are part of the Kraken.

2263
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:48,900
So for the best deals to support this patriot, use the code Kraken at mypillow.com.

2264
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,020
Amazing.

2265
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:51,020
Just amazing.

2266
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:52,020
Just amazing.

2267
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:53,020
Just amazing.

2268
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:57,400
I can't say enough how not smooth that was.

2269
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:59,020
That is really, really bad.

2270
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:02,740
But David doesn't just stop with my pillow codes.

2271
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:06,380
He also throws out like, hey, I'm big on social media.

2272
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:15,020
I've worked hard over the last few years to try to bring you real honest news at davidharrisjr.com.

2273
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:19,540
I've got 2.3 million followers on Facebook, 1.1 on Instagram.

2274
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:24,860
You can plug in his website, his social media, and that's great, but that is all just in

2275
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:31,220
order to prepare you for another plug, which is the solution to Facebook.

2276
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:32,220
Oh, okay.

2277
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:33,220
I hear people talking about Parler.

2278
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:34,220
Parler's amazing.

2279
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:38,980
It's a great alternative to Twitter, but we need an alternative to Facebook.

2280
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:43,300
Something that works and operates like Facebook, and I've found it, I'm going to be talking

2281
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,300
about it loud.

2282
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:47,320
I've got a lot of my friends are going to be talking about it loud.

2283
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:54,020
It's called Spreely, stands for Speak Freely, and here's where you can download it, S-P-R-E-E-L-Y.

2284
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:58,620
Spreely, you're going to hear a lot about that, and they're going to dominate Facebook.

2285
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:03,780
I'm going to guess they're not, but all of these people, like a lot of them seem to be

2286
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:06,680
pushing internet startups.

2287
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:10,580
Like there was that Ian Rakelin guy who came to Alex's CPAC thing, and he was trying to

2288
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:11,900
push a search engine.

2289
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:18,780
I think that they're really trying to make a little bit of a fast cash on the conservative

2290
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:22,540
agreement over social media market.

2291
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:27,260
This is what I'm saying when I say I feel for these idiots in the crowd here.

2292
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:33,220
You guys are being sold the idea that you can legally just get whatever you want, so

2293
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:39,580
long as they'll fire lawsuits and then we'll get whatever we want, because we're right.

2294
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:45,260
They're selling you all of this like, and when this happens, which we totally know it's

2295
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:50,260
going to, it will keep us from having to do the one thing that we know is the only way

2296
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:54,460
to get what we want to achieve and we're trying to avoid, and it's like you're just being

2297
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:58,760
taken along by these guys who are selling you on Spreely.

2298
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:00,460
No one's going to go on Spreely.

2299
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:01,460
No!

2300
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:02,460
Yeah.

2301
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:11,440
He also has perfected this technique that David Harris has of protected prayer, he does

2302
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:15,580
the Lord's Prayer, but he wants to really take every line of it and think about what

2303
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:16,580
does it mean.

2304
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:17,580
Oh no.

2305
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:18,580
Yeah.

2306
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:19,580
Are we going to get a commentary?

2307
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:20,580
No, we're not going to listen to all of it.

2308
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:21,580
We're not going to get an abridged version?

2309
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:22,580
It's so long.

2310
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:23,580
It's like six minutes.

2311
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:24,580
Jesus!

2312
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:25,580
Yeah.

2313
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:29,300
But this is the end of it and how smoothly it transitions into a plug.

2314
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:30,300
Oh wow.

2315
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:39,020
Give us a greater understanding, Father, of your love for us as the individual son, as

2316
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:40,660
an individual daughter.

2317
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:47,060
Give us a greater revelation, Father, of your love for us and let us be that catalyst and

2318
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:49,780
that change in our country.

2319
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:53,540
In Jesus' name, amen?

2320
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:54,860
Amen!

2321
01:41:54,860 --> 01:42:00,340
I truly believe we're going to win.

2322
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:03,420
I truly believe the fraud is going to be exposed.

2323
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:05,720
The Kraken has been released.

2324
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:12,060
We the people will not be denied seeing another four years of the amazing presidency of Donald

2325
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:13,060
J. Trump.

2326
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:14,060
God bless you.

2327
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:22,020
I think we're going to hear this and still 45.

2328
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:25,140
We're going to hear that again.

2329
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:28,620
So please visit davidharrisjr.com.

2330
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:32,260
Help me fight these suckers that are just constantly on me.

2331
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:34,740
Gotta fight these suckers that are on me.

2332
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:35,740
Wow.

2333
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:36,740
Wow.

2334
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:37,740
Quite a ride.

2335
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:44,180
And Jesus overturned those money changers tables and said, follow me at at jesus underscore

2336
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:45,180
magic.

2337
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:46,180
Help me fight these suckers?

2338
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:47,180
Yeah.

2339
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:56,260
Yeah, I found his speech to be laden with a promotion to a point where it was distracting.

2340
01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:57,260
It was a little distracting.

2341
01:42:57,260 --> 01:43:00,180
Granted, I have no idea who this guy is.

2342
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:03,220
So I can't judge his body of work.

2343
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:07,300
I can only watch this and say it was a little much.

2344
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:08,300
Yikes.

2345
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:15,220
So Jordan, our next category is the most graceful exit from someone who clearly did not want

2346
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:17,300
to be there.

2347
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:19,980
This award goes to someone we know, actually.

2348
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:22,100
He's a guy who promoted pizza gate quite heavily.

2349
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:23,100
Oh no.

2350
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:24,100
Jack.

2351
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:25,100
Oh, God damn it.

2352
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:27,740
They said that I could have longer time up here today, but I said, I want to give my

2353
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:28,820
time up.

2354
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:38,020
I want to give my time up to a whistleblower, a courageous whistleblower who saw something

2355
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:41,580
and decided to say something and stand up.

2356
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:46,740
So ladies and gentlemen, all the way from Michigan, Melissa Carone, who's going to come

2357
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:49,820
up and tell you what she saw.

2358
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:56,060
So that's the lady who appeared to be drunk with Rudy Giuliani in that video that everyone

2359
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:57,060
loved so much.

2360
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:58,060
Yeah, there it is.

2361
01:43:58,060 --> 01:44:01,340
Yeah, so Jack clearly, I got the vibe that he was, because that's like a minute into

2362
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:02,340
his being married.

2363
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:03,340
Yeah, that's great.

2364
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:04,340
He's just like, I'm out of here.

2365
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:05,340
That's great.

2366
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:06,340
That is good stuff.

2367
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:09,180
They would have given Melissa Carone a speaking spot if she'd asked.

2368
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:10,180
Totally.

2369
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:12,140
And I was like, yeah, I don't really want to do this.

2370
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:13,140
I don't want to do it.

2371
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:14,140
No.

2372
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:15,140
But I do want my name there.

2373
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:16,500
Yeah, just in case.

2374
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:17,500
I would like my attention.

2375
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:18,500
Yes.

2376
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:19,980
But I do not want to do the work for it.

2377
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:20,980
Thank you.

2378
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:21,980
Yeah.

2379
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:23,620
So congratulations, Jack.

2380
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:24,620
You made a graceful exit.

2381
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:25,620
That's well done.

2382
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:26,620
Yeah, that's well done.

2383
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:28,740
There's a, oh, there's a late entry.

2384
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:29,740
What's that?

2385
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:31,820
There's actually an escalation of this category.

2386
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:32,820
Oh no.

2387
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:36,900
Now we have to give out the award for the person who made the most graceful, I'm not

2388
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:39,140
even showing up.

2389
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:40,140
This award goes to Dinesh D'Souza.

2390
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:41,140
Now it's my honor to introduce another young lady.

2391
01:44:41,140 --> 01:44:42,140
You know her father, Dinesh D'Souza.

2392
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:43,140
You see him all over TV.

2393
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:44,140
He couldn't join us today, but Danielle D'Souza's here.

2394
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:45,140
She's a strong pro-life young woman, the author of the book, The Choice.

2395
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:46,140
And I'm proud to introduce her to you today here in Washington, D.C., Danielle D'Souza.

2396
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:47,140
Dinesh D'Souza was invited.

2397
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:48,140
He said, fuck no, I'm sending my daughter.

2398
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:49,140
I'll send my daughter.

2399
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:50,140
Dinesh D'Souza.

2400
01:44:50,140 --> 01:44:51,140
Dinesh D'Souza.

2401
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:52,140
Dinesh D'Souza.

2402
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:53,140
Dinesh D'Souza.

2403
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:54,140
Dinesh D'Souza.

2404
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:55,140
Dinesh D'Souza.

2405
01:44:55,140 --> 01:45:16,060
Wow, wow, Jack, you didn't know you could half-ass it still further.

2406
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:17,060
Yeah.

2407
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:18,060
Lazy.

2408
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:19,060
Yep, so.

2409
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:23,460
Why did you not just say, why didn't you send in a video message announcing Melissa Carbone

2410
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:24,460
or whatever?

2411
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:26,020
Well, you know who did send in a video message?

2412
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:27,020
Dinesh D'Souza?

2413
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:29,020
No, Marjorie Greene, the QAnon person in Congress.

2414
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:33,180
Oh, the crazy person, yeah, yeah, yeah, all right, good for her, good for her.

2415
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:36,500
That was one of those, like, real curveballs in terms of, like, their booking.

2416
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,500
Yeah.

2417
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:43,460
I feel like you guys are trying to have an air of not out there too far.

2418
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:46,500
So we got the craziest Congressperson we could find.

2419
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:48,660
Well, and she only sent in a video.

2420
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:50,300
Yeah, that's not good.

2421
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:51,300
That's not good.

2422
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:52,300
It could be better.

2423
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:56,380
I think democracy is not always the most popular thing to do, and I've seen that.

2424
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:57,380
It's true.

2425
01:45:57,380 --> 01:45:58,380
Yeah.

2426
01:45:58,380 --> 01:46:02,100
So the next category, Jordan, is the second most likely day drunk person after the guy

2427
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:03,220
in a sequined shirt.

2428
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:04,540
Ooh, he's 100%.

2429
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:06,180
Yes, there's no competition.

2430
01:46:06,180 --> 01:46:09,020
Yeah, no, that one's all the way up to full.

2431
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:14,540
Second place, however, second most likely, that honor goes to Boris Epstein, who I should

2432
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:20,660
remind you, the guy from Sinclair Media, I should remind you, tested positive for COVID-19

2433
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:21,940
on November 26th.

2434
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:25,860
Anyway, he showed up and he seemed drunk.

2435
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:29,740
Hello, America.

2436
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:35,860
I was told I shouldn't take the mic off, but I'm going to do it anyway.

2437
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:36,860
Right?

2438
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:37,860
Right.

2439
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:38,860
Who do we love?

2440
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:39,860
Who do we love?

2441
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:40,860
We love Trump.

2442
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:41,860
We love Trump.

2443
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:42,860
Why?

2444
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:43,860
Why?

2445
01:46:43,860 --> 01:46:44,860
We love Trump.

2446
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:45,860
We love Trump.

2447
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:46,860
We love Trump.

2448
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:47,860
We love Trump.

2449
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:48,860
We love Trump.

2450
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:55,260
Get the flags higher.

2451
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:56,980
We love Trump.

2452
01:46:56,980 --> 01:46:58,700
We love Trump.

2453
01:46:58,700 --> 01:47:00,020
We love Trump.

2454
01:47:00,020 --> 01:47:05,780
I love that Boris is like, apparently didn't hear everyone yelling to put the flags down.

2455
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:06,780
Nope.

2456
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:07,780
Get those flags up.

2457
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:08,780
Get those flags up.

2458
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:10,780
Get the flags in the air.

2459
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:14,540
At two different events, people have been saying, put the flags down so we could stream

2460
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:16,380
and Boris is like, ah, fuck that.

2461
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:17,380
I don't know.

2462
01:47:17,380 --> 01:47:18,480
I don't know if he's actually drunk.

2463
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:23,480
It's really tough to tell because it also, I realized as I was watching this, it's hard

2464
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:28,820
to tell the difference between like maybe kind of day drunk buzzed and sort of just

2465
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:35,100
jacked up off of being in front of a crowd this big and maybe doing those like standard

2466
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:37,500
get the crowd pumped up kind of things.

2467
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,620
Like those sound crazy if you do that.

2468
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:40,620
You know?

2469
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:41,620
Yeah.

2470
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:43,700
And those are the kinds of things that you instinctually do and you're drunk.

2471
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:47,060
Like getting a crowd to chant USA is really fun when you're drunk.

2472
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:48,060
Yeah, that's true.

2473
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:49,060
Yeah.

2474
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:50,060
USA.

2475
01:47:50,060 --> 01:47:54,780
I can't, that's, this is maybe the largest disconnect more than our politics even.

2476
01:47:54,780 --> 01:48:02,480
The idea, any politician, the idea of saying, if me chanting, we love blank politician,

2477
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:03,480
fuck that.

2478
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:04,480
It seems weird.

2479
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,480
Period.

2480
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:06,480
Yeah.

2481
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:10,160
I think AOC is incredible.

2482
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:13,160
I'm not going to chant, we love AOC.

2483
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,160
Fuck that.

2484
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:19,320
I would tell myself that I think I would be just as like put off by seeing large crowds

2485
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:21,880
chanting we love Obama back in 2008.

2486
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:22,880
Oh, creepy.

2487
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,060
But maybe I wouldn't have been.

2488
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:25,640
Maybe that's a bias on my part.

2489
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:26,640
I don't know.

2490
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:27,880
I like to think that I would be.

2491
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:28,880
Sure.

2492
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:29,880
But I'm not certain I would.

2493
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:35,240
I mean we were much younger then and you know, Obama was coming out after the previous worst

2494
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:37,040
president in American history.

2495
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:42,280
I like to think that I would respond the same, it'd be like weird.

2496
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:46,480
But I wonder if I would see that and I would give the like, sort of like, oh, they're not

2497
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,940
in a cult of personality.

2498
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:49,720
This is just expressing their political.

2499
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:50,720
Sure, sure.

2500
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:51,720
I wonder.

2501
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:52,720
I like to think.

2502
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:55,640
I mean, I wouldn't, I don't know Obama, Jordan.

2503
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:57,680
That was significantly long ago.

2504
01:48:57,680 --> 01:49:03,000
I would say the most recent is obviously the Bernie Sanders campaign in the primary in

2505
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,040
2016 whenever he had those massive rallies.

2506
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,440
But even then, I don't remember people screaming like.

2507
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:10,760
People are chanting like feel the Bern.

2508
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:11,760
Something like that.

2509
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:16,640
And then it's like, yeah, it's like a weird all in this together, not like, we love you.

2510
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:17,880
You know, like that's creepy.

2511
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:20,080
His slogan was not me, us.

2512
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:21,080
Yeah, exactly.

2513
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:22,080
Exactly.

2514
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:23,080
Yeah.

2515
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:24,080
We love us.

2516
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:25,480
I would be fine with chanting that.

2517
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:27,680
Yeah, I don't know.

2518
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,680
It's tough.

2519
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:29,960
I know that I don't like looking at it here.

2520
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:30,960
Oh, no.

2521
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:36,880
And I like to think that maybe even if I had turned a blind eye to it before, I would now

2522
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:40,240
look upon people chanting like, let's say, I love AOC.

2523
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:41,240
Yeah.

2524
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:43,040
And I would look at that much differently.

2525
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,040
Don't.

2526
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:45,720
So maybe this has given me an illuminating moment.

2527
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:46,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2528
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:51,360
So we have another superlative, another title.

2529
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:54,640
Person who's putting the most direct.

2530
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:57,040
I didn't prepare this title.

2531
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,040
Oh, okay.

2532
01:49:58,040 --> 01:49:59,680
This one's a little bit off the dome-y.

2533
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:03,000
Person who's putting the most effort into getting people killed.

2534
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Okay.

2535
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,760
That goes to, I don't remember his name, but he's that gym owner in New Jersey who refuses

2536
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:08,760
to stay closed.

2537
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:09,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2538
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:15,280
If you would have asked me back in February, if I thought that one person could make a

2539
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:18,000
difference, I would have laughed and said, hell no.

2540
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,700
But here I am today.

2541
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:25,280
One man, a part of a team of two guys who stood up to a governor and told him, no, we

2542
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,280
will not listen.

2543
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:32,160
And it's starting a movement across the country.

2544
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:36,640
They're trying that second wave that they've been predicting for so long and more and more

2545
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:39,200
businesses are staying open.

2546
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:44,160
And I'm here to advocate every single freedom loving American to go out and support these

2547
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:46,160
small businesses.

2548
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:54,480
And I'm going to give you a way how we created a directory, a nationwide directory of businesses

2549
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:59,120
that are staying open, thinking of it as a Yelp for freedom loving Americans who won't

2550
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:01,600
listen to COVID restrictions.

2551
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:03,240
I have a flaw in that plan.

2552
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:05,520
So go out there and support.

2553
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:10,480
That is www.stayopenstayfree.com.

2554
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:11,480
Check it out.

2555
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:14,940
Go encourage businesses to sign up and go support them.

2556
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:18,360
Because the more that do, the quicker this thing will fall apart, I promise you.

2557
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:21,800
This works equally well as a registry of businesses to avoid.

2558
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:22,800
Yeah.

2559
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:23,800
Yep.

2560
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:24,800
Yep.

2561
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:25,800
Wow.

2562
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:26,800
Yeah.

2563
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,440
I didn't think that one man could make a difference.

2564
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:36,040
But now look at me, the horsemen of plague, spreading COVID to all who come near me.

2565
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:37,040
Yeah.

2566
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:38,040
Jesus Christ, King Midas.

2567
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:39,880
That might not age well.

2568
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:40,880
Yeah.

2569
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:46,120
So I went and I looked at this guy's registry and I looked for Chicago and there's exactly

2570
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:50,400
one business in the city of Chicago and it is an apartment building.

2571
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:54,640
Which is just like, all right, I guess.

2572
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:57,120
I guess if that's where you want to promote.

2573
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:58,120
Yeah.

2574
01:51:58,120 --> 01:51:59,120
Yeah.

2575
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:00,120
Seems silly.

2576
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:01,120
Okay.

2577
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:02,120
It's a Gold Coast apartment.

2578
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:03,120
Well, that doesn't surprise me.

2579
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:04,120
Yeah.

2580
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:06,480
If it was going to be anywhere, Gold Coast is where...

2581
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:08,120
I don't know if this is what that was for.

2582
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:10,240
I think this is more about like, retail, right?

2583
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:12,040
Yeah, I was thinking so.

2584
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:13,040
Yeah.

2585
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:14,040
I don't know.

2586
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:15,040
Cool.

2587
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:17,160
So next apartment of Jordan is actually a tie.

2588
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:18,160
Yes, sir.

2589
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:19,160
This is very shocking.

2590
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:20,160
Okay.

2591
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:21,160
Most insane preacher.

2592
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,160
Ooh, there's two.

2593
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:23,160
Two.

2594
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:24,160
It's a tie.

2595
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:30,880
This one goes to Reverend Locke out of Tennessee.

2596
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:37,320
If you're glad to be on the winning side, let's make some noise, DC!

2597
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:40,960
I read the back of the book and it doesn't end with, oh me, it ends with, amen, and this

2598
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,040
thing is going to turn out all right.

2599
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:47,280
We're not going to back up, we're not going to pack up, we're not going to slack up, and

2600
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:51,760
we're not going to shut up till we've been taken up by the glory of God, and I am convinced

2601
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:54,800
that Donald J. Trump is going to remain the President of the United States.

2602
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:57,680
Do you believe that this afternoon, patriots?

2603
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:58,680
Have you met my snakes?

2604
01:52:58,680 --> 01:52:59,680
Oh my God.

2605
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:00,680
Yeah.

2606
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:01,680
Dude.

2607
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:02,680
Dude.

2608
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:03,680
We've got a revival preacher on our hands.

2609
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:04,680
Come on, buddy.

2610
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:10,560
We're getting a lot of different particular flavors of exciting preachers, and that's

2611
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:14,360
why it has to be a tie, is because these guys have completely different styles.

2612
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:15,360
Okay.

2613
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:18,320
But Reverend Locke, or Pastor Locke, who knows.

2614
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:19,320
Whatever.

2615
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:23,040
He does not ask permission when he wants to tell the devil that the devil is on notice.

2616
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:24,040
I think he should.

2617
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:27,360
No, I didn't ask permission, for I said it and never do, but let me tell you something,

2618
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:29,240
I serve notice on the devil.

2619
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:30,880
This guy is an auctioneer.

2620
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,720
I was actually thinking that exact same thing.

2621
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:36,600
I was like, man, you have a gift for saying words fast and dumb.

2622
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:38,640
Do not do this job.

2623
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:40,640
He's very exciting, verbally.

2624
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:41,640
Yeah.

2625
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:42,640
And that's why, yeah.

2626
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:47,120
I never asked the devil for a goddamn piece of permission, but I will tell you this right

2627
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:52,840
now, everybody, we see five over there, and now it's ten over there, ten, I have twenty

2628
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:56,720
over there, twenty, twenty over there, all right, and the Lord says so.

2629
01:53:56,720 --> 01:54:01,800
That's where it's functional, but unfortunately, he uses his gifts to yell about how everyone

2630
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:04,040
will be forced to bow in front of Jesus.

2631
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:05,040
That's not good.

2632
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:09,680
That in the name of Jesus, every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth

2633
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:15,560
and things under the earth, and that every, I said that, every Republican, every Democrat

2634
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:21,680
shall bow and with their voice proclaim him Lord of Lords to the glory of God the Father.

2635
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:26,760
So you have a choice, and the choice is clear.

2636
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:32,560
We can declare Jesus Lord of our life right now because we want to, or we can declare

2637
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:36,960
Jesus Christ Lord of our life in the day of judgment because we have to.

2638
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:41,400
But make no mistake, Jesus Christ is Lord.

2639
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:46,880
And I want you to chant, King of Kings, King of Kings.

2640
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:54,480
Yeah, so that guy is scary in many ways, but the vocal patterns are fun, so I'll get him

2641
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:55,480
mad.

2642
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:56,480
King of Kings.

2643
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:57,480
Yeah.

2644
01:54:57,480 --> 01:54:58,480
Oh boy.

2645
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:02,760
So the next guy who's tied here for this most insane preacher is a guy named Brian Gibson,

2646
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:04,520
and I actually found this kind of endearing.

2647
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:05,520
Okay.

2648
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:10,760
His wife brings him up, introduces him on stage, and you don't know that it's his wife

2649
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:17,160
initially because she's just like, this next speaker is just my favorite person, he's my

2650
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:18,160
husband.

2651
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:19,560
Oh, that's cute.

2652
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:20,560
It's adorable.

2653
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:21,560
All right.

2654
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:25,720
And then Brian Gibson, Pastor Brian Gibson, complains about how his Easter service didn't

2655
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:26,720
work.

2656
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:27,720
I hate my wife.

2657
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:28,720
No, it didn't work.

2658
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:29,720
His Easter service didn't work out.

2659
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:30,720
He was going to try and give eggs to children.

2660
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:31,720
Okay.

2661
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:34,440
On Easter Sunday, I blew a fuse.

2662
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:37,020
I put together an Easter egg giveaway.

2663
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:40,440
We were going to give some kids an egg in the name of Jesus.

2664
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:45,360
The health department called me, said if I gave those eggs away, that they would shut

2665
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:49,460
down the church of the Lord Jesus Christ.

2666
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:51,200
You keep those fucking eggs.

2667
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:54,320
The health department is accused to not give up those eggs.

2668
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:58,060
I swear to God, that's your bitching.

2669
01:55:58,060 --> 01:55:59,320
That's what you're complaining about.

2670
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:00,320
You keep those eggs.

2671
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:01,320
Wow.

2672
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:06,080
And I'm going to tell you, no one has the authority to shut down the church of the Lord

2673
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:10,880
Jesus Christ, except Jesus Christ himself, when he returns to church.

2674
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:14,640
Come on, give God a hand clap, if you believe it out there.

2675
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:17,080
Give God a hand clap.

2676
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:19,200
Does God need applause?

2677
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:20,200
Yes.

2678
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:22,840
I organized a parking lot communion service.

2679
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:24,920
I called all of the press.

2680
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:30,520
I said, come out, tell the governor I'm distributing communion elements and they can come arrest

2681
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:35,160
me because I'd love to go to jail for the preaching of the gospel.

2682
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:36,760
That's not what you would be going to jail for, sir.

2683
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:38,760
You were not actually preaching gospel.

2684
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:41,600
Used to every time I got drunk and coked up, I got arrested.

2685
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,600
What's up with that?

2686
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:43,600
What is up with that?

2687
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:44,600
What is up with that?

2688
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:45,600
Yeah.

2689
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:46,600
What is up with that?

2690
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,440
Now I can't get arrested for preaching?

2691
01:56:48,440 --> 01:56:49,440
No.

2692
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:50,440
Wow.

2693
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:51,440
Oh boy.

2694
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:52,440
Kind of a little bit telling there.

2695
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:53,440
A little bit there.

2696
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:59,840
Anyway, he would not make the cut if it weren't for his just extreme Christian nationalist

2697
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:00,840
leanings.

2698
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:08,800
Let me say this, America did not birth the church.

2699
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:14,320
America did not birth the church, but the church birthed America.

2700
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:15,320
Not true, sir.

2701
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:16,320
Sir, sir.

2702
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:17,320
Excuse me.

2703
01:57:17,320 --> 01:57:23,240
And the only thing that will save America is the same thing that birthed America, the

2704
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:25,080
church of the Lord Jesus Christ.

2705
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:26,080
So yeah, I mean this is just-

2706
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:29,720
I was going to go with King George, but I guess I was wrong.

2707
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:30,720
Nope.

2708
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:31,720
I guess I was wrong.

2709
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:32,720
I guess I was way off.

2710
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:34,840
What about that whole no taxation without representation thing?

2711
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:35,840
Wasn't that really important?

2712
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:36,840
Or was it-

2713
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:37,840
Church.

2714
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:38,840
Is it just church?

2715
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:39,840
Church.

2716
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:40,840
All right.

2717
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:41,840
Okay.

2718
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:42,840
You realize that the Puritans were kicked out-

2719
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:43,840
Church.

2720
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:44,840
Because they hated them.

2721
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:45,840
Church.

2722
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:46,840
Because everybody hated them.

2723
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:47,840
Again-

2724
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:48,840
Because they're the worst.

2725
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:54,280
These two preachers are at the one that is not the more religiously branded one.

2726
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:55,280
Wow.

2727
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:56,280
Jesus.

2728
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:57,960
They're at the one that wasn't the product of a vision.

2729
01:57:57,960 --> 01:57:58,960
Yeah.

2730
01:57:58,960 --> 01:57:59,960
Yep.

2731
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:02,920
I'm trying to tell you that all of this is-

2732
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:10,060
You know, I want to say, I want to say, religious people, come get your guys or you get what

2733
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:12,060
you get, man.

2734
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:13,060
That's mockery?

2735
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:14,060
That's mockery.

2736
01:58:14,060 --> 01:58:15,060
Oh.

2737
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:16,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2738
01:58:16,060 --> 01:58:18,040
I don't blame decent religious people for this.

2739
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:20,560
I blame religion for this.

2740
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,920
That's an interesting conversation I don't want to have right now.

2741
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:23,920
Fair.

2742
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:24,920
Fair point.

2743
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:25,920
I do want to give out the next award.

2744
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:26,920
Okay.

2745
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:27,920
And this is the last award.

2746
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:28,920
All right.

2747
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:31,800
It's a bewildering transition between speakers.

2748
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:32,800
Okay.

2749
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:38,000
This begins with a woman whose name is either Anna Kate or Anna K. It's hard to tell from

2750
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,000
the intro.

2751
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Okay.

2752
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,000
The intro is a guy named Matt Couch.

2753
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Sure, sure.

2754
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Who's giving her the intro.

2755
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,000
He's a guy-

2756
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
From mycouch.com.

2757
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
No, no.

2758
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,000
There's a great promo code.

2759
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:50,520
He's a dude who really did some damage to the Rich family, the Seth Rich conspiracy

2760
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:51,520
shit.

2761
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:52,520
Oh, he did.

2762
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:55,040
I don't know what the fuck anyone's doing ever letting him speak in public again.

2763
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:56,040
Wow.

2764
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:57,040
Fuck me.

2765
01:58:57,040 --> 01:59:01,840
She's giving the intro to either Anna Kate or Anna K. No idea.

2766
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:08,020
She's a very devout Trump worshiper who's apparently been in prayer for 40 days straight,

2767
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:11,280
and I guess she's breaking that now to give the people of this rally an update.

2768
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,500
How dare you fucking lie like that?

2769
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:15,160
You lie piece of shit.

2770
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:20,760
She says that prophecy has promised that Trump will be given two consecutive terms, so therefore

2771
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:22,400
he must have won.

2772
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:26,400
After saying this, she's got a message for the devil.

2773
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:32,340
The second message is for the devil and his minions and all the wizards and witches that

2774
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:36,200
are watching right now all over the world.

2775
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:37,200
This is for you.

2776
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:38,200
We're going to do a chant right now.

2777
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:39,200
It's for me?

2778
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:41,200
We're going to do a chant because it's awesome to exalt Trump.

2779
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:42,200
Oh, no.

2780
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:43,200
You're going to chant?

2781
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:44,200
Trump is our anointed one.

2782
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:45,200
He's your anointed one.

2783
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:46,560
To bring justice back into this country.

2784
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:47,560
Not justice.

2785
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:49,720
I do worry that I'm one of the wizards.

2786
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:51,440
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you're a wizard.

2787
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:52,440
Yeah.

2788
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:53,440
Yeah, without question.

2789
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:56,360
I think that no matter what the reality is, I would be looked upon as a wizard.

2790
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:57,360
Totally.

2791
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:58,360
Totally.

2792
01:59:58,360 --> 01:59:59,360
No, it doesn't matter.

2793
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:02,720
Honestly, even if there was no religion, I'm still looking at you just going like, you

2794
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:04,560
got a real Lord of the Ringsy vibe to you.

2795
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:07,480
I've been forced into the role of a wizard.

2796
02:00:07,480 --> 02:00:09,080
I mean, you leaned into it though.

2797
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:15,620
You're erudite, you're obsessive, you live on the third floor, you're in a tower, if

2798
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:16,620
you will.

2799
02:00:16,620 --> 02:00:17,620
Come on, buddy.

2800
02:00:17,620 --> 02:00:19,400
You're John D reincarnated.

2801
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:20,400
All right.

2802
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:21,400
Fine.

2803
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:22,400
I'm a wizard.

2804
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:25,040
Anyway, this lady chants for Jesus.

2805
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:27,000
She wants to chant Jesus' name.

2806
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,160
Is the devil weak to chants?

2807
02:00:29,160 --> 02:00:30,160
Yes.

2808
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:31,160
Oh, okay.

2809
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:32,160
Shit.

2810
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:33,840
I know that because I'm a wizard.

2811
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:38,880
So they chant Jesus and then she repents for abortion, which is apparently a blood sacrifice

2812
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:39,880
to Baal.

2813
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:40,880
Sure.

2814
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:44,240
Count of three, we're going to chant Jesus because this was a vision I had a few weeks

2815
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:48,560
ago because it's shifting in the atmosphere now in Jesus' name.

2816
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:49,560
Lord, we repent.

2817
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:54,440
Before we chant his name, Lord, we repent for all the blood sacrifice that has been

2818
02:00:54,440 --> 02:00:55,960
poured out in this nation, Lord.

2819
02:00:55,960 --> 02:00:58,600
We repent for abortion, Lord God.

2820
02:00:58,600 --> 02:00:59,760
The sacrifice is to Baal.

2821
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:00,760
We exult you, Lord.

2822
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:03,440
So yeah, and then they start chanting Jesus.

2823
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:10,560
Now, Jordan, here is the transition that is outrageous and made me laugh out loud while

2824
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,760
hours into watching these stupid rallies.

2825
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:14,360
This is your second rally?

2826
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:15,360
Yes.

2827
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:16,360
Oh boy.

2828
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:19,360
And I loved this moment more than I can really put into words.

2829
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:24,000
So mic down for this, enjoy this minute and 15 second ride.

2830
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Jesus.

2831
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Jesus.

2832
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Jesus.

2833
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Jesus.

2834
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Jesus.

2835
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Glory to God.

2836
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,000
We're going to see a miracle.

2837
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Amen.

2838
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Amazing.

2839
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Right?

2840
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:50,800
Hey guys, right here in the middle, if we could keep the flags down, we have some guys

2841
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:54,480
at RSPN who have been with us the whole way.

2842
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:55,480
They're amazing.

2843
02:01:55,480 --> 02:02:00,040
Let's block at the shot and we want to make sure people at home can enjoy it too.

2844
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:02,040
Thank you guys.

2845
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:03,480
Yeah.

2846
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:07,000
Just right here in the center between us and the cameras, everybody else.

2847
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:13,200
We love you guys as flags are amazing and we love RSPN because you guys need to be watching

2848
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:14,200
them.

2849
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:17,840
All right, next up, we're going to mix it up.

2850
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:28,080
We're going to bring some amazing artists out here, Bryce and Graham, 4G out of Blow.

2851
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:33,080
Y'all ready to turn up?

2852
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:36,120
It's hard for me to move around with this mic though.

2853
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:37,240
All right.

2854
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:43,300
So what's happened here is that we started with the lady chanting Jesus who had a message

2855
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:48,000
for the devil and the wizards, and then my drunk friend comes back out.

2856
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:52,680
He tells people to keep those flags down, a little bit more admin, a little bit of business,

2857
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:55,600
and then he introduces a rap act.

2858
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:58,880
There's a rap concert.

2859
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:02,760
It was easier to have religious epiphanies before technology, I imagine.

2860
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:09,060
No point during the sermon on the Mount was Peter like, hey guys, guys, we are leaving

2861
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:11,720
too much bread around.

2862
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:16,680
There is a lot of bread going around on the floors, it is attracting too many birds, birds

2863
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:18,040
are getting in the shot.

2864
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:19,600
This is not hitchhock.

2865
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:21,560
And now a rap concert on the Mount.

2866
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:24,000
And now a rap concert on the Mount.

2867
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:28,160
So yeah, this guy named Bryson Gray comes out to do a little rap set.

2868
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:29,160
All right.

2869
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:30,160
He has a couple albums that he's put out.

2870
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:31,160
All right.

2871
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:33,240
One's called Maga Season, spelled S-Z-N.

2872
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:35,120
Oh, he's hot.

2873
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:38,520
Another one, another album called Maga Christmas.

2874
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:49,880
Another, another album called Maga Ain't Got No Color, and his other album, Can't Cancel

2875
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:50,880
God.

2876
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:56,320
So, was it his label who wanted the Christmas album or was it?

2877
02:03:56,320 --> 02:04:01,420
So I went and I listened to a little bit of his stuff and I got to say he's serviceable

2878
02:04:01,420 --> 02:04:03,280
as an actual rapper.

2879
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:04,920
He's not good.

2880
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:05,920
As a lyricist?

2881
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:06,920
Yes.

2882
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:12,680
And as someone who's delivering words over beats, he's not as bad as a lot of people

2883
02:04:12,680 --> 02:04:13,680
I've heard.

2884
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:14,680
I will say that.

2885
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:17,560
And I think he's just not, he's not anything interesting.

2886
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:19,720
I don't find anything compelling about it.

2887
02:04:19,720 --> 02:04:24,720
It's largely just like rapping, you know, sort of conspiracy talking points and Trump

2888
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:25,720
shit.

2889
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:26,720
I don't really care.

2890
02:04:26,720 --> 02:04:29,440
But I went and I actually found a review of one of his albums.

2891
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:32,640
It was shocking because like the review really agreed with me.

2892
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:36,680
Like he's not terrible, but this is boring.

2893
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:40,600
I like that because it was like, yeah, this review isn't insulting him.

2894
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:42,920
It's not like saying he's a shitty rapper.

2895
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:44,920
It's like, you're not doing anything interesting.

2896
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:46,680
It's kind of uncompelling.

2897
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:48,680
You have some skill or whatever.

2898
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:49,680
Oh man.

2899
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:50,680
No, you hate my politics.

2900
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:55,280
Honestly, your politics, I do hate them, but we're talking about the music here, buddy.

2901
02:04:55,280 --> 02:05:02,180
If you could deliver your politics in an interesting artistic way, I might still appreciate what

2902
02:05:02,180 --> 02:05:06,440
you make, even if I disagree with what you're putting out, possibly.

2903
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:08,920
I might be able to get there, but you're just boring as hell.

2904
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:11,360
Look, everybody knows Cecil DeMille, okay?

2905
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:12,360
We get it.

2906
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,360
Yeah.

2907
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:19,560
So he comes out with another rapper whose name I forget because I don't care, but they

2908
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:23,560
have some tech issues at the beginning and so they have to vamp for a little bit.

2909
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:24,560
Of course they have to vamp.

2910
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:25,560
And then the music starts.

2911
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:29,600
And this is the last clip because what ends up happening is just perfect.

2912
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:31,600
It could not be more perfect.

2913
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:33,280
I think that this sums up everything.

2914
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:37,320
Who out here is disappointed in the Supreme court decision yesterday?

2915
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:41,200
God, God told the Patriots.

2916
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:45,160
They thought they was going to kill our spirit, but we still out here and we still live Trump

2917
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:46,160
2020 on a gang.

2918
02:05:46,160 --> 02:05:51,520
Y'all got to say I'm working.

2919
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:52,520
I heard the play.

2920
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:53,520
Did you hear?

2921
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:54,520
Oh, here we go.

2922
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:55,520
I love the second amendment.

2923
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:56,520
Y'all ready?

2924
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:57,520
God gave it to me.

2925
02:05:57,520 --> 02:06:13,240
Not one politician.

2926
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:35,840
God told him Bible reading, God believe in truth, speaking American, it's magazines and

2927
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:36,840
Democrats.

2928
02:06:36,840 --> 02:07:02,360
They go away from the rap concert to do a MyPillow commercial.

2929
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:03,360
Wow.

2930
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:08,520
Uh, guys, guys, you were supposed to get the, uh, you were supposed to get the version without

2931
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:09,520
the lyrics.

2932
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:13,360
I just wanted to the instrumental guys, guys, the instrumental it's rapping with me.

2933
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:14,360
Yeah.

2934
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:15,360
It's rapping with me.

2935
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:16,440
Mostly the track.

2936
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:18,360
I'm supposed to, what is this riff raff?

2937
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:20,120
I'm supposed to actually perform.

2938
02:07:20,120 --> 02:07:21,120
Yeah.

2939
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:23,720
One of the things that I found really interesting too, is if you watch this video, there's a

2940
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:26,560
guy who looks like Napoleon dynamite on stage.

2941
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:27,560
Wow.

2942
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:28,560
Gotta have him.

2943
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:29,560
I don't know what this dude is doing.

2944
02:07:29,560 --> 02:07:35,840
I can't tell if he's with them and there as a visual joke that he's dancing along with

2945
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:40,640
them or whatever, or if he's like from some other outlet cause he's carrying like a stick

2946
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:41,640
mic.

2947
02:07:41,640 --> 02:07:42,640
Sure, sure.

2948
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:43,640
Of course.

2949
02:07:43,640 --> 02:07:44,640
I don't, I have no idea what's going on.

2950
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,640
It's bewildering.

2951
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:46,640
It's modern Forrest Gump.

2952
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:50,320
We're going to find a movie about that guy 20 years from now and he's going to be everywhere.

2953
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:51,420
It's outrageous.

2954
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:53,840
He will have inserted himself into the Vietnam war.

2955
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:59,080
I can't tell you how like weird, like obviously we're recording this on Sunday and this was

2956
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:00,240
all happening on Saturday.

2957
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:04,600
And so in order to make this really work, it ended up like I had a really late night

2958
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:05,660
last night.

2959
02:08:05,660 --> 02:08:12,040
And so I'm like, you know, late into the evening watching these banal speeches and then hearing

2960
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:18,760
this lady being like, we must chant Jesus name and then a rap concert break it out.

2961
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:21,440
I was so amused by it.

2962
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:25,880
And then the fact that the broadcast goes straight to a MyPillow commercial in the middle

2963
02:08:25,880 --> 02:08:31,560
of maybe the most energetic thing they had on their stage the entire time.

2964
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:35,800
It just was kind of disrespectful to this very serviceable rapper.

2965
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:36,800
Jesus.

2966
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:38,360
Jesus Christ.

2967
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:39,360
Indeed.

2968
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:43,760
That is, that has got to be the most surreal night I can think of.

2969
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:50,040
Like to go that, so just to ride that all the way through to like three.

2970
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:53,520
See now if you were just watching one rally, no big deal.

2971
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:54,520
Sure.

2972
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:56,560
No big deal, no big cuts, but you, you listen to Alex Jones.

2973
02:08:56,560 --> 02:08:57,560
Yeah.

2974
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:58,560
I have a high tolerance.

2975
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:01,440
But you're watching seven straight hours of rallies.

2976
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,560
At least.

2977
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:08,080
Seven straight hours of rallies on after a long day into the wee hours of the morning.

2978
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:09,080
Yep.

2979
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:13,360
And at a certain point, didn't you have to just have a complete break from reality?

2980
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:17,320
I kind of did think at a certain point I was making up what was happening.

2981
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:21,560
It feels like you, that must have been, that's how I would feel if you're telling me this

2982
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:22,560
happened.

2983
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:23,560
It was surreal.

2984
02:09:23,560 --> 02:09:24,760
I was doing it by myself.

2985
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:25,760
Do you know what I mean?

2986
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:26,760
Yeah.

2987
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:32,000
There were, there were a couple points where I thought like, this is self parody.

2988
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Yeah.

2989
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:37,400
There, there is no way Mike Flynn's speech started with a MyPillow ad.

2990
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:38,400
It can't be.

2991
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:40,880
Why is this guy giving out MyPillow codes?

2992
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:41,880
It can't be.

2993
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:42,880
This is nonsense.

2994
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:44,600
This cannot be as a thing.

2995
02:09:44,600 --> 02:09:50,640
It's, it's so tough to like really put your hands on what this is.

2996
02:09:50,640 --> 02:09:51,640
Yeah.

2997
02:09:51,640 --> 02:10:00,920
It's, it's simultaneously a terrifying display of different levels of explicitness about

2998
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:03,040
a desire to live in a Christian theocracy.

2999
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:04,040
Yeah.

3000
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:10,400
You know, it's not about, um, standing up for your right to be able to practice your

3001
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:11,400
religion.

3002
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:15,160
It's about enforcing your religious beliefs onto the government, making the government

3003
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:20,600
adhere to your religious beliefs at the expense of everyone else who does not share your beliefs.

3004
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:21,600
You got it.

3005
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:22,600
It's horrifying.

3006
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:23,600
Horrifying.

3007
02:10:23,600 --> 02:10:28,640
Because you have the, you know, the, the Jericho March, which is maybe, you know, obviously

3008
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:31,320
more upfront about it.

3009
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:33,320
It's called the Jericho.

3010
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:37,560
But it shares overlap in funding and speakers with the same other March.

3011
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:43,360
And quite honestly, I think that the people that I heard on the other March, the women

3012
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:48,480
for Trump or women for America first, there was more Christian nationalism probably on

3013
02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:49,480
display there.

3014
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:50,480
Yeah.

3015
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:53,320
They, they did, they didn't have someone like Leon Benjamin saying, we got to kill the devil

3016
02:10:53,320 --> 02:10:54,320
so our kids don't have to.

3017
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:55,320
There was that one.

3018
02:10:55,320 --> 02:11:02,760
There was a little bit more speak freely going on over there, but I, I think I'm more scared

3019
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:07,540
of the women for America first rally, honestly, because they're smart enough to not allow

3020
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:08,540
Alex there.

3021
02:11:08,540 --> 02:11:09,540
Right.

3022
02:11:09,540 --> 02:11:13,280
It's, it's fascism packaged by Coca-Cola.

3023
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:19,840
Like it is, it is so much, and well, yeah, I mean, that's that like tying together of

3024
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:31,260
just base base commerce, just fucking promo code level commerce with fucking your ostensible

3025
02:11:31,260 --> 02:11:34,720
belief system, which we all know is complete bullshit.

3026
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:40,160
If you, if you think anything that those rallies had to do, those rallies had zero to do with

3027
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:41,160
Christianity.

3028
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:42,160
I agree.

3029
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:43,160
Zero.

3030
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:45,320
It's a mask that's being worn.

3031
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:46,320
100%.

3032
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:49,800
And one of the things that's really difficult is that like, I don't, I'm not saying that

3033
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:52,680
of everybody who's in the crowd again.

3034
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:57,920
Like I think that there's probably maybe some sincere and misled people who are there.

3035
02:11:57,920 --> 02:11:58,920
Sure.

3036
02:11:58,920 --> 02:11:59,920
I don't know.

3037
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:00,920
I can't, I can't say.

3038
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:01,920
Yeah.

3039
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:08,120
But I don't think that, I can't imagine that the people who are putting this on are motivated

3040
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:11,240
by a sincere spirituality.

3041
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:12,240
Absolutely not.

3042
02:12:12,240 --> 02:12:16,140
It's very difficult for me to accept that and maybe it feels that way to them.

3043
02:12:16,140 --> 02:12:17,140
I'm not sure.

3044
02:12:17,140 --> 02:12:18,140
It's very difficult to judge.

3045
02:12:18,140 --> 02:12:23,920
I wrestle with this because it's something that's so intimate and personal within someone

3046
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:30,520
like true religious feelings and whenever you sort of criticize somebody about their

3047
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:37,200
sincerity or lack thereof, it kind of comes off as if, oh, you think you have sincere

3048
02:12:37,200 --> 02:12:38,200
beliefs.

3049
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:39,200
No.

3050
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:41,960
And I don't, I don't want to get into that kind of an argument, but this is gross.

3051
02:12:41,960 --> 02:12:45,960
Here's, here's what I would say about that.

3052
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:54,160
If your beliefs are sincere and you're looking for Christ and all that stuff, go read the

3053
02:12:54,160 --> 02:13:00,060
Way of the Pilgrim and really, really like meditate on Thessalonians and the idea of

3054
02:13:00,060 --> 02:13:05,080
praying every day and every moment and what that actually means.

3055
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:09,160
Or you could go to a rally and try and overthrow a nation and kill a bunch of people.

3056
02:13:09,160 --> 02:13:10,160
Yeah.

3057
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:16,480
The novelty that I have is the combination of both of these rallies being so explicitly

3058
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:26,120
like Christian nationalist in character, so overt about it and both of them being so crass.

3059
02:13:26,120 --> 02:13:32,000
Like the joke, like we're laughing our asses off at all the MyPillow stuff, but like that's

3060
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,640
it both of these rallies.

3061
02:13:33,640 --> 02:13:35,040
It's happening at both of them.

3062
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:36,040
So fucked.

3063
02:13:36,040 --> 02:13:43,880
And the parody level of the like praying and chanting Jesus into a drunk guy introducing

3064
02:13:43,880 --> 02:13:44,880
a rap act.

3065
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:45,880
Just ridiculous.

3066
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:46,880
Like it's bizarre.

3067
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:47,880
It's surreal.

3068
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:53,800
And I don't know what to do with it, but I do think that like Alex Jones got a lot of

3069
02:13:53,800 --> 02:13:58,400
headlines out of crashing that Jericho March one.

3070
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:00,340
And so it does come into our view.

3071
02:14:00,340 --> 02:14:04,720
And I think that one of the things that's important, I guess, is to take what we know

3072
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:09,760
about Alex and what we understand about that and glimpse the external world a little bit

3073
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:16,640
when there is a chance to, and quite honestly, looking at these people, some of whom I'm

3074
02:14:16,640 --> 02:14:21,140
aware of, some of whom I'm not, who are chosen by these people who are organizing these rallies

3075
02:14:21,140 --> 02:14:25,560
to give these speeches, I don't see a lot of difference between what they're putting

3076
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:27,400
out there and what Alex does.

3077
02:14:27,400 --> 02:14:28,400
Nope.

3078
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:34,040
And that is not how I felt even like, even when we look back at like 2009, like even

3079
02:14:34,040 --> 02:14:38,640
when the Tea Party was going on, there were still substantive differences between the

3080
02:14:38,640 --> 02:14:40,520
Tea Party and Alex Jones.

3081
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:41,960
Alex was more severe.

3082
02:14:41,960 --> 02:14:42,960
Yeah.

3083
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:49,380
He may be more severe than some of these people and more extreme, but like these rallies,

3084
02:14:49,380 --> 02:14:55,480
I don't understand why, except for bad press, they would not let Alex speak at both of them.

3085
02:14:55,480 --> 02:14:56,480
I don't know.

3086
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:57,480
I don't get it.

3087
02:14:57,480 --> 02:14:58,480
I don't know.

3088
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:01,480
I don't get why they have to parade around even at the Jericho March with the code.

3089
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:02,480
Pretending that he's not there.

3090
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:08,040
And the code of like in the spirit of inclusion and you know, like all that, like go fuck

3091
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:09,040
yourself.

3092
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:11,800
He's right on board with exactly what you're, he's doing what you're doing better.

3093
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:12,800
Yeah.

3094
02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:19,720
The idea that they are still allowed to, like that was Alex's role for Fox News and the

3095
02:15:19,720 --> 02:15:23,580
Rush Limbaugh's and the Glenn Beck's is for them to be like, hey, at least we're not like

3096
02:15:23,580 --> 02:15:24,580
Alex Jones.

3097
02:15:24,580 --> 02:15:25,580
Right.

3098
02:15:25,580 --> 02:15:29,240
They're all like that and they're still trying to act like by saying, hey, at least we're

3099
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:33,880
not Alex Jones in Info Wars, we still get a, we still get that difference.

3100
02:15:33,880 --> 02:15:35,400
You're not, there's no difference.

3101
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:36,400
There's no difference.

3102
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:37,400
No.

3103
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:40,240
Well, I mean, so how dare you act like you're too good for Alex.

3104
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:44,100
If there is, I'm mad on it, I'm mad on his behalf.

3105
02:15:44,100 --> 02:15:45,100
Don't feel that way.

3106
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:46,100
I don't.

3107
02:15:46,100 --> 02:15:50,120
But I think, I think that, you know, I can see where that thought comes from.

3108
02:15:50,120 --> 02:15:51,120
Yeah, of course.

3109
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:57,240
It largely comes from the reality that if you watch that rally, you'll see a difference

3110
02:15:57,240 --> 02:16:00,920
in competence from Alex and the rest of the speakers.

3111
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:01,920
Yep.

3112
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:06,880
If the, if the goal is to rile up this crowd, God damn it does Alex do a better job than

3113
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:07,880
any of the rest of them.

3114
02:16:07,880 --> 02:16:13,720
Even at that point when he's like getting not allowed on stage, he gets the crowd to

3115
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:14,720
chant his name.

3116
02:16:14,720 --> 02:16:15,720
People are still chanting, we love Alex.

3117
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:16,720
Yeah.

3118
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:17,720
Yeah, totally.

3119
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:20,360
Gets on the bullhorn and yells 1776 and people start chanting his name.

3120
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:21,720
And that's how you fucking do it.

3121
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:22,720
Right.

3122
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:27,120
He can do all this better than all of you, but unfortunately his brand is so toxic that

3123
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:31,000
no one, even Ali Alexander wants to admit that he basically works for Infowars.

3124
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Yeah, no kidding.

3125
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:35,280
So, I mean, it's kind of like, I don't know.

3126
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:40,760
I think that this kind of sums up what I think is one of the main problems.

3127
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:45,120
Who's had it with these fact checkers?

3128
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:47,720
Haven't you had it with these fact checkers?

3129
02:16:47,720 --> 02:16:50,200
That could almost be the big problem.

3130
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:51,960
That's probably a better way of putting it.

3131
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:52,960
Yeah.

3132
02:16:52,960 --> 02:16:55,880
I think, I think when you cheer for fuck fact checkers.

3133
02:16:55,880 --> 02:16:57,280
Who's up with all this reality?

3134
02:16:57,280 --> 02:16:58,280
Yeah.

3135
02:16:58,280 --> 02:17:01,320
Who's up here with, I'm sick of it, I'm sick of it.

3136
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:02,320
Let's live in a dream world.

3137
02:17:02,320 --> 02:17:03,320
Let's live in a dream world.

3138
02:17:03,320 --> 02:17:05,320
Who wants to live in a dream world?

3139
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:06,320
Boo.

3140
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:08,480
Hey, who likes to confirm things?

3141
02:17:08,480 --> 02:17:09,480
Boo.

3142
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:10,480
Boo.

3143
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:12,080
Read a book.

3144
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:13,920
The mind is the fear killer.

3145
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:16,280
Fear, fear, mind killer.

3146
02:17:16,280 --> 02:17:17,280
Boo.

3147
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:18,280
Yeah.

3148
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:24,320
So I thought this was an interesting exploration, a little bit sort of, not fully outside of

3149
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:27,200
our realm but sort of to the side of it a tiny bit.

3150
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:28,200
Sure, sure.

3151
02:17:28,200 --> 02:17:35,400
And it bummed me out more than usual just because it's like, oh, all these people chanting

3152
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:40,360
and cheering and all these speakers sounding very similar to Alex.

3153
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:44,320
It's a bummer and I think we have a very large problem in front of us that I do not know

3154
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:45,320
how to deal with.

3155
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:46,320
Yeah.

3156
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:53,440
And I think that it's important to recognize that one of the major problems is the blurring

3157
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:54,680
here.

3158
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:56,120
This is not political.

3159
02:17:56,120 --> 02:17:57,320
This isn't about politics.

3160
02:17:57,320 --> 02:18:00,200
This is not about policies.

3161
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:01,760
This is something else altogether.

3162
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:07,920
And trying to approach it from the standpoint of arguing or politics, it's not gonna work.

3163
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:09,560
It's absolutely not gonna work.

3164
02:18:09,560 --> 02:18:11,200
Here's my pitch, all right?

3165
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:18,920
Now I think one of the speakers did point out that the nation was created and now he

3166
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:25,400
said it was created by God and I would argue that it was created because of King George

3167
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:27,600
and the like and his ilk.

3168
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:29,240
Who's had it with these fact checkers?

3169
02:18:29,240 --> 02:18:30,240
All right.

3170
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:36,040
But maybe we should learn something from King George, Dan, okay?

3171
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:37,040
What did King George do?

3172
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:39,280
I already dispute your premise because I hate fact checkers.

3173
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:44,500
What did King George do or what did the king do when faced with Puritans?

3174
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:50,600
They were causing a ruckus and then he was like, get the fuck out, and then they all

3175
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:51,600
left.

3176
02:18:51,600 --> 02:18:52,600
Yeah, I know.

3177
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:53,860
So we shoot him to the moon, Dan.

3178
02:18:53,860 --> 02:18:59,440
This seems too much like those mentalities that I find kind of noxious, which are the

3179
02:18:59,440 --> 02:19:00,440
like, you don't like it, get out.

3180
02:19:00,440 --> 02:19:01,440
I was being facetious about this.

3181
02:19:01,440 --> 02:19:02,440
I was being facetious about this.

3182
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:05,520
I know, but even as a joke, I don't really like it because it sounds so much like the,

3183
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:08,080
you know, you hear this rhetoric from Trump people.

3184
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:11,800
You know, like Trump being the president, get out.

3185
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:14,560
And I just don't think that's a good solution either.

3186
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:15,560
Sure.

3187
02:19:15,560 --> 02:19:16,560
I don't know.

3188
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:17,560
I don't know.

3189
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:21,040
It's a, it's a tough time to be in the middle of this because I don't really know how the

3190
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:22,040
ball breaks.

3191
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:25,400
Well, steadfast tolerance of intolerance clearly isn't working.

3192
02:19:25,400 --> 02:19:26,840
No, I would agree with that.

3193
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:27,840
Kicking people out.

3194
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:29,880
That's not a great solution.

3195
02:19:29,880 --> 02:19:31,880
Didn't work last time.

3196
02:19:31,880 --> 02:19:33,480
No.

3197
02:19:33,480 --> 02:19:34,680
Violence doesn't work.

3198
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:36,360
Violence doesn't do it.

3199
02:19:36,360 --> 02:19:39,760
Maybe we should try using like those.

3200
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:41,760
So it's like 2020, right?

3201
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:49,240
And that means that before 2020, there was like a bunch of years and humans and they've

3202
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:51,960
probably dealt with some shit like this before.

3203
02:19:51,960 --> 02:19:53,240
We should probably try smarts.

3204
02:19:53,240 --> 02:20:00,160
Well, I wish that I had this clip because actually a really great general, Michael Flynn,

3205
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:01,160
you might've heard of him.

3206
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:02,160
I've heard of him.

3207
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:03,160
Yeah.

3208
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:05,160
In his speech, he discusses how this has never happened in human history before.

3209
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:06,160
It's never happened.

3210
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:07,520
So actually we can't learn anything from history.

3211
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:10,080
It's a completely new and unique situation.

3212
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:15,600
It's really convenient how we can't know anything about this because it's never happened before.

3213
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:17,320
So unfortunately you're wrong.

3214
02:20:17,320 --> 02:20:19,920
All those book learning idiots, this has never happened before.

3215
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:20,920
Don't listen to them.

3216
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:22,520
Yeah, they're a bunch of dumb fact checkers.

3217
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:23,520
Fuck them.

3218
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:24,520
Fuck them.

3219
02:20:24,520 --> 02:20:25,520
God damn it.

3220
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:26,520
I don't know.

3221
02:20:26,520 --> 02:20:30,280
Anyway, we'll be back on our next episode talking more specifically about Alex Jones,

3222
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:32,840
but I don't know.

3223
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:33,840
These rallies sucked.

3224
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:34,840
They sucked.

3225
02:20:34,840 --> 02:20:35,840
Anyway, we'll be back.

3226
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:37,800
But until then, we have a website.

3227
02:20:37,800 --> 02:20:38,800
We do have a website.

3228
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:39,800
It's knowledgefight.com.

3229
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:40,800
Yep.

3230
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:41,800
We're also on Twitter.

3231
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:42,800
We are on Twitter.

3232
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:43,800
It's at Knowledge Fight.

3233
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:44,800
Now go to Ben Jordan.

3234
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:45,800
We're also on Facebook.

3235
02:20:45,800 --> 02:20:46,800
We are on Facebook.

3236
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:49,720
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

3237
02:20:49,720 --> 02:20:50,720
doing God's work.

3238
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:51,720
Yes.

3239
02:20:51,720 --> 02:20:52,720
We'll be back.

3240
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:53,720
But until then, I'm Neo.

3241
02:20:53,720 --> 02:20:54,720
I'm Leo.

3242
02:20:54,720 --> 02:20:55,720
I'm DZX Clark.

3243
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:56,720
I'm Daryl Rundis.

3244
02:20:56,720 --> 02:20:59,680
I am about to go buy a red sequin smoking jacket.

3245
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:00,680
Andy in Kansas.

3246
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:01,680
You're on the air.

3247
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:02,680
Thanks for holding.

3248
02:21:02,680 --> 02:21:03,680
Hello, Alex.

3249
