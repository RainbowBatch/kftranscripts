00:12.960 --> 00:18.040
Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am sweating.

00:18.040 --> 00:20.480
N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight dot com.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.480
It's time to pray.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.920
I have great respect for knowledge fight.

00:23.920 --> 00:24.920
Knowledge fight.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
Knowledge fight.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Dan and Jordan.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Knowledge fight.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Riddle her.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Riddle her.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Riddle her.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
I need money.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Riddle her.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Riddle her.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Riddle her.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Andy and Kansas.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Andy and Kansas.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Stop it.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Andy and Kansas.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Andy and Kansas.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
It's time to pray.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Andy and Kansas.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
You're on the air.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Thanks for holding us.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Hello, Alex.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
I'm a first time caller.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
I'm a huge fan.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
I love your room.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I love you.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Hey, everybody.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm Dan.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm Jordan.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
We're a couple dudes.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
We like to sit around, take novelty beverages, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Jordan.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Dan.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Jordan.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Quick question for you.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
What's up?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
What's your bright spot today?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
My bright spot today is cereals.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Okay.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
I have gone...

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Like the old radio cereals?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Like the shadow?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Like the...

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
I wish that was what I was saying.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
No, I'm talking about breakfasts.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Oh.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.920
I mentioned to you that I have been exploring the world of ordering groceries for the sake

01:28.920 --> 01:29.920
of safety.

01:29.920 --> 01:30.920
COVID.

01:30.920 --> 01:35.600
And one of the things that has led me to do is more browsing than maybe I'm used to at

01:35.600 --> 01:36.600
a grocery store.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.600
Sure.

01:37.600 --> 01:38.600
Sure.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.600
I kind of get in and get out at a grocery store, generally.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.600
Absolutely.

01:41.600 --> 01:45.880
I kind of know what I'm looking for, and I don't eat that many different foods.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.480
Wearing blinders at the grocery store.

01:47.480 --> 01:50.480
Go to the frozen pizza section, kachunk, kachunk.

01:50.480 --> 01:51.480
And go home.

01:51.480 --> 01:52.480
Yes.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.480
I'm browsing through.

01:53.480 --> 01:59.400
I've noticed that there are a number of cereals now that really excite me, but also offend

01:59.400 --> 02:00.400
me.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.400
Okay.

02:01.400 --> 02:02.400
All right.

02:02.400 --> 02:03.400
All right.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.200
These are the cereals where everybody is playing each other's game.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.200
Okay.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.400
Everyone is in each other's lanes, and I don't know what's going on.

02:09.400 --> 02:16.000
Oh, do you mean like Kellogg's Rice Krispies will suddenly have like a peanut butter ball

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
version?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Yes.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Yes.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
And you're like, no, no, that's Reese's Puffs.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
You stay the fuck out of here, Rice Krispies.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.320
And you have like Fruit Loops with marshmallows.

02:22.320 --> 02:23.800
Yeah, and you're wrong.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.800
You're working Lucky Chimes side of the street.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.120
What are you doing here?

02:27.120 --> 02:28.120
Yes.

02:28.120 --> 02:29.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.280
And it's weird because when I was a kid, I probably would have loved this.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.280
Oh, gone ape shit.

02:32.280 --> 02:38.160
Yeah, but now as a 36-year-old man, I'm looking at this and I'm like, God, I gotta try it,

02:38.160 --> 02:39.160
but I don't want to.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.560
No, it's the worst.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.200
Everybody's fighting on a corner war.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.000
It's the drug war all over again.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.880
One thing I was thinking about doing, but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to pull

02:47.880 --> 02:51.820
it off because I don't know if I'll actually be able to get all of them.

02:51.820 --> 02:56.280
And I don't know how many of these hybrids there are, but it seems like there's a bunch.

02:56.280 --> 03:01.200
I was thinking about trying to get a bunch and seeing who steals other people's gimmicks

03:01.200 --> 03:02.200
best.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.200
Okay.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.600
All right.

03:04.600 --> 03:09.600
Does Frosted Flakes, is that improved with marshmallows?

03:09.600 --> 03:10.600
I don't know how it would work.

03:10.600 --> 03:15.120
I'll tell you, the Chocolate Frosted Flakes, I tried those, absolutely disgusting.

03:15.120 --> 03:19.280
They're delicious for the first three bites and then you're like, I'm not four years

03:19.280 --> 03:21.240
old anymore, so this much sugar is going to kill me.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.240
Yeah.

03:22.240 --> 03:23.240
I'm going to go with a no.

03:23.240 --> 03:26.040
I think that there's probably a lot of that in what I would find.

03:26.040 --> 03:35.000
I did get the Lucky Charms, but with the regular pieces that aren't marshmallows are like

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
honey.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Oh, were those good?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
No.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.360
Kind of just like, I like regular Lucky Charms.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.360
They're good.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.360
They're magically delicious.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.640
I do like how many people are trying new stuff, whatever.

03:49.640 --> 03:54.440
It's like, guys, I have been with Lucky Charms for four, it's like I've been smoking Newport

03:54.440 --> 03:57.640
since I was nine years old and you guys are going to come up with some bullshit.

03:57.640 --> 04:01.300
Like the camel crush, the first time the camel crush happened, I'm like, this is an affront

04:01.300 --> 04:02.300
against God.

04:02.300 --> 04:05.000
How dare you combine these two flavors?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
It's wrong.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
But then.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
They're great.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
So maybe you should try all these series.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah, I know you should.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
So what about you?

04:12.000 --> 04:15.480
The next spot, Dan, is The Avalanche has released a new album.

04:15.480 --> 04:19.400
The Avalanche has released two albums in one decade, Dan.

04:19.400 --> 04:20.400
That's insane.

04:20.400 --> 04:21.400
Below in your mind, isn't it?

04:21.400 --> 04:26.880
Yeah, I was like, wow, 15 years between Since I Left You and whatever they came out with

04:26.880 --> 04:27.880
second.

04:27.880 --> 04:28.880
Yeah, Wildflower.

04:28.880 --> 04:29.880
Yeah, yeah.

04:29.880 --> 04:30.880
Wow.

04:30.880 --> 04:31.880
Yeah, yeah.

04:31.880 --> 04:36.920
And then just now, We Will Always Love You released Friday, absolutely fantastic.

04:36.920 --> 04:37.920
That's cool.

04:37.920 --> 04:41.920
I don't want to be a hater, but I didn't really like their second album as much as I liked

04:41.920 --> 04:45.280
Since I Left You back when I used to smoke a lot of weed when I was younger.

04:45.280 --> 04:50.060
I mean, Since I Left You was kind of genre busting in that they really took sampling

04:50.060 --> 04:51.060
too far.

04:51.060 --> 04:52.060
Yeah.

04:52.060 --> 04:53.060
They were like, hey, what if...

04:53.060 --> 04:54.060
No, no, no.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.860
I know you like the Amen break and we'll strengthen it.

04:55.860 --> 05:01.560
What if instead we took 48 milliseconds and combined it with 48 milliseconds of 10 million

05:01.560 --> 05:02.560
other songs?

05:02.560 --> 05:03.560
Yeah.

05:03.560 --> 05:07.320
And like I was just the right age and like I said, smoking tons of weed and Frontier

05:07.320 --> 05:09.240
Psychiatrist like blew my mind.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.720
It blew everybody's mind.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.440
How did you get that parent?

05:12.440 --> 05:13.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.800
The music video of it was so bizarre.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.280
Totally.

05:18.280 --> 05:22.800
I don't know how any other album they made could not kind of be a letdown based on the

05:22.800 --> 05:24.840
experience of that at that time.

05:24.840 --> 05:25.840
Sure, sure.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.520
But I'll try and have an open mind for this other one.

05:28.520 --> 05:34.080
You know, in 2001 you thought they were mind-melting geniuses who were going to change music forever

05:34.080 --> 05:38.600
and then their next album was a really good album if you were good producers, but it's

05:38.600 --> 05:42.360
not, you know, genre-busting, era-defining stuff.

05:42.360 --> 05:45.720
I think the problem is the decade in between.

05:45.720 --> 05:52.120
Like if you put out a sophomore album that's just serviceable or just good the next year,

05:52.120 --> 05:57.800
it's more understandable than like waiting for Chinese democracy and it just being, just

05:57.800 --> 05:58.800
being eh.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.640
You can't do that.

06:00.640 --> 06:01.640
That is fair.

06:01.640 --> 06:02.640
That's fair.

06:02.640 --> 06:03.640
This one's really good though.

06:03.640 --> 06:04.640
You can't live up to that hype.

06:04.640 --> 06:05.640
It's tough.

06:05.640 --> 06:06.640
This one's great.

06:06.640 --> 06:07.920
They got a bunch of really good guests on it.

06:07.920 --> 06:10.480
They do a lot of like classic trip-hop stuff.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.040
It almost sounds a little Portishead-y.

06:12.040 --> 06:14.200
They get tricky to do a verse.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.600
Then they go full disco.

06:16.600 --> 06:20.200
They got some disco and then they got some classic avalanches walking songs, which is

06:20.200 --> 06:21.880
what the avalanches do best.

06:21.880 --> 06:22.880
I'll check it out.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.280
So, Jordan, today we've got an interesting episode to go over.

06:25.280 --> 06:28.120
We're going to be talking about The Weeknd with the band.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.120
The band?

06:29.120 --> 06:30.120
Yes.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.120
He's that guy.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.120
Genre-busting!

06:32.120 --> 06:33.120
He was!

06:33.120 --> 06:36.680
Okay, back in 2007, whenever his first EP's dropped.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.720
I don't know enough about The Weeknd.

06:38.720 --> 06:39.720
I know quite a bit.

06:39.720 --> 06:45.800
We're going to be talking about the day that was 12-12-2020.

06:45.800 --> 06:48.740
The day out on DC's...

06:48.740 --> 06:50.040
Alex didn't move to DC.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.680
No, I didn't think so.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.320
But he did go to DC.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.720
I assumed he would go.

06:54.720 --> 06:59.840
And so today we're going to be taking a look at some of the events on the nation's capital.

06:59.840 --> 07:00.840
Oh boy.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.260
But first, before we get to that, let's take a moment, Jordan, to say thank you to some

07:03.260 --> 07:04.800
folks who have signed up and are supporting the show.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.800
Oh, that's a great idea.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.600
So first, Bamboozer, thank you so much.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.680
You are now a policy wonk.

07:08.680 --> 07:09.720
I'm a policy wonk.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.720
Thanks Bamboozer!

07:10.720 --> 07:11.720
Thank you.

07:11.720 --> 07:12.800
Next, Jim F. thank you so much.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.160
You are now a policy wonk.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.320
I'm a policy wonk.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.320
Thanks Jim!

07:16.320 --> 07:17.320
Thank you!

07:17.320 --> 07:18.320
Next, Ryon H. thank you so much.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.760
You are now a policy wonk.

07:19.760 --> 07:20.880
I'm a policy wonk.

07:20.880 --> 07:21.880
Thank you RyRy!

07:21.880 --> 07:23.600
That's what I'm calling old Ryons come on.

07:23.600 --> 07:28.320
Next, it could be Jel J-E-L-L-E.

07:28.320 --> 07:29.660
I think it's probably Jel.

07:29.660 --> 07:31.140
Thank you so much.

07:31.140 --> 07:32.320
You are now a policy wonk.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.320
I'm a policy wonk!

07:33.320 --> 07:34.320
Thank you very much!

07:34.320 --> 07:35.420
Could be a reference to Cats!

07:35.420 --> 07:36.660
I'm gonna go with Jelle.

07:36.660 --> 07:37.660
Could be a Jellicle.

07:37.660 --> 07:38.660
I'm gonna go with Jelle.

07:38.660 --> 07:40.300
This could be a Jellicle Wonk.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.660
It could be a Jellicle Wonk.

07:41.660 --> 07:44.300
I don't know if they had one of those in the original Cats, though.

07:44.300 --> 07:47.540
Next, Kabir S. Thank you so much, you are now a Policy Wonk.

07:47.540 --> 07:48.540
I'm a Policy Wonk!

07:48.540 --> 07:49.540
Thanks Kabir!

07:49.540 --> 07:50.540
Thank you!

07:50.540 --> 07:52.460
Next, Will O. Thank you so much, you are now a Policy Wonk.

07:52.460 --> 07:53.460
I'm a Policy Wonk!

07:53.460 --> 07:54.460
Thanks Will!

07:54.460 --> 07:55.460
Thank you!

07:55.460 --> 07:56.460
Next, Rebecca O. Thank you so much.

07:56.460 --> 07:57.460
No relation.

07:57.460 --> 07:58.460
Okay.

07:58.460 --> 07:59.460
Uh, thank you, you're a Policy Wonk.

07:59.460 --> 08:00.460
I'm a Policy Wonk!

08:00.460 --> 08:01.460
Thanks Rebecca!

08:01.460 --> 08:02.460
Thank you!

08:02.460 --> 08:05.860
Thank you to a couple of people who donated on Elevated Love and we appreciate that very

08:05.860 --> 08:06.860
much.

08:06.860 --> 08:08.460
So, Andy K. Thank you so much, you are now a Technocrat.

08:08.460 --> 08:10.380
And it goes on.

08:10.380 --> 08:12.300
Thank you so much, you are now a Technocrat.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.300
I'm a Policy Wonk.

08:13.300 --> 08:14.300
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.300
Have yourself a brew.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.300
How's your 401k doing, bro?

08:16.300 --> 08:17.300
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

08:17.300 --> 08:18.300
Let's just get down to business.

08:18.300 --> 08:19.300
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.300
Why you pimps so good?

08:20.300 --> 08:21.300
My neck is freakishly large.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.300
I declare info war on you.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.300
Thank you so much, Andy.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.300
And thank you so much, Andy.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.300
Thank you so much, Andy.

08:25.300 --> 08:26.300
Thank you so much, Andy.

08:26.300 --> 08:27.300
Thank you so much, Andy.

08:27.300 --> 08:32.980
Thank you so much, Andy, and thank you so much, and it goes on.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.540
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

08:34.540 --> 08:36.820
If you're out there listening and you're thinking, hey, I enjoy the show, I'd like to support

08:36.820 --> 08:39.580
these gents too, you can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com, clicking

08:39.580 --> 08:41.180
the button that says support the show, or...

08:41.180 --> 08:45.020
Or what you could do is you could go to a record store, go back into the back part of

08:45.020 --> 08:49.260
the record store, start searching through all your favorite bands, maybe some disco

08:49.260 --> 08:53.820
bands, maybe some esoteric stuff that other people haven't seen, find some generosity

08:53.820 --> 08:54.820
in there.

08:54.820 --> 08:58.860
Get a little bits of the best generosity from each one of those little crates over there,

08:58.860 --> 09:03.860
combine it together to make something amazingly generous, and take it to your local bail fund

09:03.860 --> 09:04.860
or charity.

09:04.860 --> 09:05.860
Bigging in the crates!

09:05.860 --> 09:06.860
Yep.

09:06.860 --> 09:07.860
Uh, great.

09:07.860 --> 09:08.860
Yeah.

09:08.860 --> 09:09.860
Thank you.

09:09.860 --> 09:10.860
Yeah.

09:10.860 --> 09:11.860
So, Jordan.

09:11.860 --> 09:12.860
Yes, sir.

09:12.860 --> 09:13.860
Today.

09:13.860 --> 09:14.860
What about it?

09:14.860 --> 09:17.060
We are going to be talking about the rallies that happened in DC over the weekend.

09:17.060 --> 09:18.060
Yeah, they went great.

09:18.060 --> 09:23.220
Now, one thing that's really difficult for me is I'm not going to be addressing, really,

09:23.220 --> 09:24.860
the street violence.

09:24.860 --> 09:25.860
Sure.

09:25.860 --> 09:29.300
And I think that that is a failing of our show to an extent, and that is because I don't

09:29.300 --> 09:32.340
have enough time to get into it.

09:32.340 --> 09:38.900
Not on our show, I mean in terms of, like, cover it with the seriousness and the focus

09:38.900 --> 09:40.740
that I think the topic deserves.

09:40.740 --> 09:42.900
Sure, we're a silly show about Alex Jones.

09:42.900 --> 09:43.900
Yes.

09:43.900 --> 09:50.440
I don't want to give short shrift to that, but at the same time, it falls slightly outside

09:50.440 --> 09:52.740
of what I have the time to cover.

09:52.740 --> 09:56.500
As we've seen with Rogan, half-assing it is sometimes worse than doing anything at all.

09:56.500 --> 10:01.140
Yes, but I did not want people to think that I turn a blind eye to that kind of thing,

10:01.140 --> 10:06.800
or tacitly accept such, such.

10:06.800 --> 10:11.700
So Jordan, on Saturday, there were multiple rallies that were happening in DC, surrounding

10:11.700 --> 10:14.460
the idea that this election had been stolen.

10:14.460 --> 10:15.460
Stop that steal.

10:15.460 --> 10:16.460
You know what I'm saying?

10:16.460 --> 10:17.460
Sure.

10:17.460 --> 10:20.460
They were both about the same thing, had the same theme, and even featured some overlapping

10:20.460 --> 10:21.460
speakers.

10:21.460 --> 10:24.860
It was super confusing, but I think I know what was up.

10:24.860 --> 10:28.700
One of the rallies was being held by the Women for America First, the group that formed out

10:28.700 --> 10:33.100
of the Tea Party, which is trying to use these protests and some of this unrest to secure

10:33.100 --> 10:37.220
more power for the Republican Party, while simultaneously trying to make the Republican

10:37.220 --> 10:40.180
Party as weird as possible, like they did with the Tea Party.

10:40.180 --> 10:41.180
Yes, correct.

10:41.180 --> 10:46.780
The other rally was called the Jericho March, which made no secret about just being an overtly

10:46.780 --> 10:50.780
Christian extremist rally with some really outrageous planned speakers.

10:50.780 --> 10:57.020
Well, if I remember my story of Jericho well, I believe those people were the nice ones.

10:57.020 --> 11:04.620
They decided to end the siege by negotiating, coming to a fair solution for both parties,

11:04.620 --> 11:05.620
right?

11:05.620 --> 11:06.620
Sure.

11:06.620 --> 11:07.620
Yeah.

11:07.620 --> 11:11.300
That Jericho March had Ali Alexander in the mix, a friend from Infowars.

11:11.300 --> 11:17.860
They also had the Cowboys for Trump, and noted asshole slash Congress member Paul Gosar.

11:17.860 --> 11:21.400
It's really hard for me to tell what exactly was going on, and I kind of don't think that

11:21.400 --> 11:24.560
these two were opposing rallies per se.

11:24.560 --> 11:28.060
Your instinct would be to think that the Jericho March was for the religious zealots, whereas

11:28.060 --> 11:32.120
the Women for America First would be the more restrained one.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.220
But honestly, the rallies were almost identical.

11:34.220 --> 11:35.220
Yeah, they're both the same people.

11:35.220 --> 11:36.220
I watched both of them.

11:36.220 --> 11:38.320
Yeah, they're the same people.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.300
Not all the same people, but it's the same vibe.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I mean.

11:42.180 --> 11:43.180
Yeah.

11:43.180 --> 11:47.180
Both featured Mike Flynn giving the same speech, both had appearances from and got funding

11:47.180 --> 11:52.840
from the MyPillow guy, and both were overwhelmingly religious.

11:52.840 --> 11:58.420
Watching these rallies, one thing that's abundantly clear to me, and that's something that I think

11:58.420 --> 12:03.220
is very important for us to bring up, is we're not dealing with politics here at all.

12:03.220 --> 12:04.860
This is not politics.

12:04.860 --> 12:10.220
This is a cult with some interest in politics as a means to gaining and retaining power,

12:10.220 --> 12:15.180
and I don't really know how to talk about that without, like, I don't know.

12:15.180 --> 12:18.660
I don't know how to engage with the ideas of a cult.

12:18.660 --> 12:24.360
Um, I mean, I think the best way to engage with the ideas of cult is on a grand scale,

12:24.360 --> 12:29.540
and what we should do to stimulate the economy is train 50% of the country in cult deprogramming

12:29.540 --> 12:31.780
to help them with the other 50%.

12:31.780 --> 12:32.780
That's a new deal.

12:32.780 --> 12:33.900
I think that's a good way to do it.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.820
It's like the Works Progress Administration.

12:35.820 --> 12:36.820
Sure.

12:36.820 --> 12:37.820
Yeah.

12:37.820 --> 12:42.380
It's just, it's really difficult because it comes off, or it can be, like, misconstrued

12:42.380 --> 12:47.140
as attacking religion to attack this kind of thing that's going on, and I don't have

12:47.140 --> 12:51.940
any interest in attacking religion or Christianity, I have a problem with what this is.

12:51.940 --> 12:52.940
Yeah.

12:52.940 --> 12:53.940
And that's tough.

12:53.940 --> 12:58.100
Because when we hear a person say that Bill Gates said X, Y, or Z in an interview, it's

12:58.100 --> 13:02.020
really easy to go find that interview and discuss what's going on.

13:02.020 --> 13:06.380
When we hear that same person say that God has chosen Donald Trump to be president, it's

13:06.380 --> 13:10.260
not too difficult to say that they're a bit of a fanatic, and they're probably unwell.

13:10.260 --> 13:15.980
The difficulty comes when there are two multi-hour rallies attended by thousands of people where

13:15.980 --> 13:20.860
the speakers repeatedly and incessantly insist that God has chosen Trump to be president,

13:20.860 --> 13:22.060
and everyone cheers.

13:22.060 --> 13:23.060
Mm-hmm.

13:23.060 --> 13:24.060
That's tough.

13:24.060 --> 13:25.060
Yeah.

13:25.060 --> 13:26.060
That is really fucked up.

13:26.060 --> 13:27.060
Yeah.

13:27.060 --> 13:30.700
We know where Alex is at, we know where his head is, we know what he's up to, and so I

13:30.700 --> 13:35.660
thought maybe a good use of our time today would be to look at these rallies themselves,

13:35.660 --> 13:40.300
and try and assess where we're at with all this, and see if it's something that we can

13:40.300 --> 13:45.740
learn to talk about a little bit better, and see if there's anybody who pops up who is

13:45.740 --> 13:47.300
a particularly good crazy.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.300
Oh, good.

13:48.300 --> 13:51.700
Maybe there'll be somebody who's like... If this is-

13:51.700 --> 13:53.340
I don't think Hamamoto's coming back.

13:53.340 --> 13:54.340
No.

13:54.340 --> 13:55.340
No.

13:55.340 --> 13:56.340
No.

13:56.340 --> 13:57.340
I don't think Hamamoto got his invite for this one.

13:57.340 --> 13:58.340
Daryl is on the outs.

13:58.340 --> 13:59.340
I think we can let that one go.

13:59.340 --> 14:00.340
Yeah.

14:00.340 --> 14:04.100
He's still yelling at Linda Katehi out at UC Davis.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.100
Okay.

14:05.100 --> 14:11.580
No, but I figure like, hey, you've got one... I think each rally was at least four hours

14:11.580 --> 14:12.580
long.

14:12.580 --> 14:13.580
Jesus.

14:13.580 --> 14:14.580
You've got a lot of speakers.

14:14.580 --> 14:15.580
Yeah.

14:15.580 --> 14:19.900
Maybe somebody is going to be like, all right, you got something, or maybe you got a weirdness,

14:19.900 --> 14:21.780
I'm going to be interested in looking into.

14:21.780 --> 14:22.780
All right.

14:22.780 --> 14:24.660
So maybe that's worth our time.

14:24.660 --> 14:27.680
So we're going to start here, Jordan, with the Jericho March.

14:27.680 --> 14:30.020
This was hosted by Eric Mataxas.

14:30.020 --> 14:32.460
I'm kind of aware of who this guy is.

14:32.460 --> 14:37.660
He's like a Christian writer and a radio host, but I really don't know a ton about him.

14:37.660 --> 14:41.780
And based on his work emceeing this event, that will probably be the way it stays, because

14:41.780 --> 14:43.700
this dude is straight up boring as hell.

14:43.700 --> 14:44.700
Oh, come on, man.

14:44.700 --> 14:49.660
A whole lot of awful stage patter type material, and then just calls to praise the Lord.

14:49.660 --> 14:50.660
Oh, boy.

14:50.660 --> 14:51.660
Okay.

14:51.660 --> 14:52.660
Yeah.

14:52.660 --> 14:57.980
So we're starting with the one that's more explicitly religious, and you get that right

14:57.980 --> 14:58.980
from the job.

14:58.980 --> 15:02.660
So we're going to get some Ace Freely band talk, and then we're going to smooth into

15:02.660 --> 15:03.660
the...

15:03.660 --> 15:04.660
First of all, it's Paul Stanley.

15:04.660 --> 15:05.660
Whatever.

15:05.660 --> 15:06.660
How dare you.

15:06.660 --> 15:07.660
Whatever.

15:07.660 --> 15:08.660
Yes.

15:08.660 --> 15:11.460
Eric Mataxas does have some things he needs to get off his chest.

15:11.460 --> 15:12.460
Okay, there we go.

15:12.460 --> 15:14.460
He comes in, he's like, hey, what's up, DC?

15:14.460 --> 15:18.300
I heard y'all like the taste of alcohol.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.900
All right.

15:20.900 --> 15:22.500
Let's overthrow democracy forever.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.900
All right, let's move on.

15:23.900 --> 15:28.020
Who out there is drinking screwdrivers?

15:28.020 --> 15:34.100
It doesn't start with that, it starts very religious.

15:34.100 --> 15:39.240
We are here because we love the God of the Bible.

15:39.240 --> 15:44.340
We are here because we believe he is the God of history.

15:44.340 --> 15:52.620
We're here because we know that he is the God who does real miracles.

15:52.620 --> 16:00.660
When his remnant cries out to him in humility and love and says, Abba, Father.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.660
We need you, Abba, Father.

16:02.660 --> 16:12.000
We are here today to cry out to the God of heaven, to ask him to have mercy on the greatest

16:12.000 --> 16:14.420
nation in the history of the world.

16:14.420 --> 16:16.860
So it's pretty overtly religious.

16:16.860 --> 16:18.540
Yeah, that one's a little bit on the nose.

16:18.540 --> 16:22.060
That's like maybe 15 seconds into the rally.

16:22.060 --> 16:25.580
I'm glad we got the tone set.

16:25.580 --> 16:27.460
We were worshipping the God of history.

16:27.460 --> 16:28.460
All right.

16:28.460 --> 16:29.460
All right.

16:29.460 --> 16:30.460
Yikes.

16:30.460 --> 16:37.420
So this rally itself, this Jericho march, was the product apparently of two people who

16:37.420 --> 16:38.860
had a vision.

16:38.860 --> 16:41.020
And Eric Metaxas is going to discuss that here.

16:41.020 --> 16:42.020
Oh boy.

16:42.020 --> 16:49.620
Now the man and the woman who didn't know each other until a little while ago, Rob Weaver

16:49.620 --> 16:56.620
and Irina Grossu, okay, each of them independently, in case you didn't know the story, each of

16:56.620 --> 17:01.020
them had an insane vision from God.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.700
How would we know the story?

17:02.700 --> 17:06.600
Rob Weaver told me this story a few nights ago.

17:06.600 --> 17:11.420
He says he doesn't normally get visions like this and the Lord woke him up.

17:11.420 --> 17:21.660
It's a dramatic story and he had this insane open vision of people gathered blowing shofars.

17:21.660 --> 17:24.580
There were nuns there when he described it to me exactly.

17:24.580 --> 17:30.500
The bad news is it looked nothing like this and you guys need to leave right now.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.500
I was kidding.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.500
That was a joke.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.020
He had a vision from God.

17:34.020 --> 17:38.840
When God gives you a vision, you don't need to know anything else.

17:38.840 --> 17:43.460
You just praise him that he cares enough to show you what he is doing.

17:43.460 --> 17:46.260
I have vision questions too.

17:46.260 --> 17:48.740
We'll learn more about this vision later.

17:48.740 --> 17:51.940
But the thing that I think is interesting is that is a terrible joke.

17:51.940 --> 17:55.620
I would have to go with yes, that is a terrible joke.

17:55.620 --> 17:58.420
But at the same time, that's what he's doing.

17:58.420 --> 18:04.100
And I think actually, if I were the promoter or the booker of this, he's a perfect host.

18:04.100 --> 18:07.220
No, he's doing a great job for what he's doing.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.680
He comes off slightly charismatic.

18:09.680 --> 18:13.740
It's not offensive, but you can still tell it's an attempt at humor.

18:13.740 --> 18:18.460
He's personable to the audience that's the target of this rally.

18:18.460 --> 18:19.460
But it's also trash.

18:19.460 --> 18:24.200
Yeah, but it's unmemorably a bad joke where you're like, joke registered.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.700
You know what, I'm not going to hold it against you.

18:25.700 --> 18:26.700
We're just going to move on.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.340
It does feel like somebody who's there for a check.

18:29.340 --> 18:32.020
Who's like, I'll get paid.

18:32.020 --> 18:33.020
Gotta clock in.

18:33.020 --> 18:35.820
Yeah, I've done those gigs before.

18:35.820 --> 18:38.340
It's almost a cut and paste kind of host joke.

18:38.340 --> 18:42.860
And I think you see a lot of that if you do enough stand up and you can kind of get that

18:42.860 --> 18:43.860
vibe from him.

18:43.860 --> 18:48.940
But at the same time, I kind of prefer that to someone who's maybe taken too big a swing.

18:48.940 --> 18:51.740
Sometimes that goes really badly.

18:51.740 --> 18:57.100
I would give a lot of money to see this guy try and do crowd work at one of these rallies.

18:57.100 --> 18:58.420
That would be brutal.

18:58.420 --> 19:00.500
So we got these two people, they had a vision.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.740
One is Rob Weaver.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.960
He is an evangelical Christian.

19:03.960 --> 19:08.180
And then Aria Grosu, who is a Catholic.

19:08.180 --> 19:13.300
And so the two of them both had a vision and the, uh, yeah, we'll, we'll meet them a little

19:13.300 --> 19:16.060
bit later, but that's why this is happening.

19:16.060 --> 19:17.060
All right.

19:17.060 --> 19:21.260
So this is happening because the evangelical Christians and the Catholics have finally

19:21.260 --> 19:26.100
both received the independent message from God that they were looking for in order to

19:26.100 --> 19:33.180
combine and put aside their previous doctrinal differences in order to take back Trump's

19:33.180 --> 19:34.180
presidency.

19:34.180 --> 19:35.180
Right.

19:35.180 --> 19:40.780
Your whole fucking religion boils down to Trump, you pathetic shitbags.

19:40.780 --> 19:45.420
That's the part that I really have trouble with is like, I have nothing against religion.

19:45.420 --> 19:46.940
I have nothing against Christianity.

19:46.940 --> 19:52.020
I have a real problem with the way in which there be like Christianity and Trump are being

19:52.020 --> 19:53.020
melded.

19:53.020 --> 19:54.020
Yeah.

19:54.020 --> 19:58.220
I mean, when we're talking about this religion, I'm not going to shit on Christianity as a

19:58.220 --> 20:02.020
as like quote unquote concept or religion as a whole.

20:02.020 --> 20:07.080
But I will say that it is eminently reasonable to shit on your religion.

20:07.080 --> 20:12.660
If you think that your ultimate battle of good and evil involves Donald fucking Trump,

20:12.660 --> 20:14.660
that is tough to wrestle with.

20:14.660 --> 20:15.660
Yeah.

20:15.660 --> 20:19.120
Your religion is so tiny and weak and meaningless.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.540
If that's, if that's what it is, yeah.

20:21.540 --> 20:25.300
If it relies on Donald Trump, uh, yeah.

20:25.300 --> 20:31.760
And when you hear things like this and it's just like, what we are, what God is doing

20:31.760 --> 20:35.340
in the United States today by his grace.

20:35.340 --> 20:39.820
And today we're going to see heaven move.

20:39.820 --> 20:42.860
Heaven is going to move.

20:42.860 --> 20:44.560
Thank you, Jesus.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.380
Thank you, Jesus.

20:46.380 --> 20:52.760
Before I introduce my friend Mike Lindell, who's going to tell you to use the discount

20:52.760 --> 20:55.060
code Eric because I would never do that.

20:55.060 --> 21:00.420
That would be self serving before I introduced Mike Lindell.

21:00.420 --> 21:03.220
I'd like to lead you in the pledge of allegiance.

21:03.220 --> 21:08.580
So like he's talking about how God is going to make heaven move and then immediately he's

21:08.580 --> 21:12.260
going to introduce the MyPillow guy and he gives a promo code.

21:12.260 --> 21:14.980
God does not give promo codes.

21:14.980 --> 21:15.980
Mike Lindell does.

21:15.980 --> 21:16.980
Yeah, I get that.

21:16.980 --> 21:21.360
But if you're at a religious rally and somebody gives you a promo code, then leave.

21:21.360 --> 21:25.820
One of the problems that I find with both of these rallies is they are very clearly

21:25.820 --> 21:27.820
funded by MyPillow.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.860
He's very clearly.

21:30.860 --> 21:31.860
It's spawncon?

21:31.860 --> 21:33.100
Is this spawncon?

21:33.100 --> 21:34.100
Is that what we're doing?

21:34.100 --> 21:35.100
I think it might be.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.860
At your religious rally, there's sponsored content.

21:37.860 --> 21:38.860
Okay.

21:38.860 --> 21:39.860
Fuck off.

21:39.860 --> 21:42.300
I'm a bit worried that that is the case.

21:42.300 --> 21:45.380
And that means that he gets to speak.

21:45.380 --> 21:46.380
He gets a walk on roll.

21:46.380 --> 21:47.380
You get to buy your way in.

21:47.380 --> 21:48.380
Yeah.

21:48.380 --> 21:49.380
So MyPillow guy.

21:49.380 --> 21:52.700
Nothing says Jesus more than buying five minutes of stage time.

21:52.700 --> 22:00.900
So right before this event, there had been that Supreme Court had thrown out the case

22:00.900 --> 22:01.900
in Pennsylvania.

22:01.900 --> 22:04.140
Yeah, they screamed it was too legally good.

22:04.140 --> 22:05.140
Yes.

22:05.140 --> 22:08.740
And the MyPillow guy has some news about this that he received.

22:08.740 --> 22:13.060
First of all, he says that Sidney Powell called him at two in the morning to give him some

22:13.060 --> 22:14.060
news.

22:14.060 --> 22:15.060
Good.

22:15.060 --> 22:16.060
Why is she calling you at two in the morning?

22:16.060 --> 22:18.500
He's the MyPillow guy, Dan.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.460
He's the front coordinator.

22:20.460 --> 22:22.780
I got problems with this story.

22:22.780 --> 22:24.900
Hello, everyone.

22:24.900 --> 22:28.940
I'm going to start off by bringing you some hope.

22:28.940 --> 22:34.420
Last night, about two in the morning, I got a text from Sidney Powell's team, and the

22:34.420 --> 22:40.220
Texas lawsuits had nothing to do with what she's been working hard on.

22:40.220 --> 22:49.500
And she filed her lawsuits with the Supreme Court for Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, and

22:49.500 --> 22:54.460
Arizona.

22:54.460 --> 22:59.020
And everything that I've been telling you for three weeks now is true.

22:59.020 --> 23:00.420
I have seen it.

23:00.420 --> 23:09.100
The fraud is 100%, and Donald Trump will be our president for four more years.

23:09.100 --> 23:10.420
By a pillow.

23:10.420 --> 23:11.420
Wow.

23:11.420 --> 23:12.420
Wow.

23:12.420 --> 23:13.420
Yeah.

23:13.420 --> 23:14.420
So sorry, I said Pennsylvania.

23:14.420 --> 23:15.660
I meant that Texas space.

23:15.660 --> 23:16.660
Yeah.

23:16.660 --> 23:20.900
All these sad attempts to overturn the election mixed up.

23:20.900 --> 23:27.740
But yeah, I like the idea that Sidney Powell texted him and was like, hey, that had nothing

23:27.740 --> 23:28.740
to do with me.

23:28.740 --> 23:29.740
Don't worry about me.

23:29.740 --> 23:30.740
Don't worry about me.

23:30.740 --> 23:32.880
I'm on crazy adventure number four over here.

23:32.880 --> 23:36.140
This looks like a big setback, but that was not our deal.

23:36.140 --> 23:37.260
Hold on.

23:37.260 --> 23:38.260
I'm not even there.

23:38.260 --> 23:39.260
Watch out.

23:39.260 --> 23:42.580
I got to watch this guy rip a heart out of another dude.

23:42.580 --> 23:44.600
I like that.

23:44.600 --> 23:51.900
And it does set the tone, kind of, for the event, and that is everybody is joyous.

23:51.900 --> 23:56.220
Turns out that there was this big setback where Texas and, you know, like all these

23:56.220 --> 24:02.380
people had signed on, all these Republican members of the House had signed on with this

24:02.380 --> 24:03.740
and then it didn't work.

24:03.740 --> 24:11.460
It seemed like, hey, that was kind of almost like Ron Paul winning the Iowa caucus of this

24:11.460 --> 24:12.500
cycle.

24:12.500 --> 24:16.260
There's that moment of hope and then it's gone, but no, my pillow guy says Sidney Powell

24:16.260 --> 24:19.100
texted him at two in the morning and said, hey, be cool.

24:19.100 --> 24:20.100
So wild.

24:20.100 --> 24:21.100
Yeah.

24:21.100 --> 24:26.380
So I would buy this making sense if I knew that all of the rich Republicans and business

24:26.380 --> 24:31.220
owners and all that stuff were all like buying a lot of property in a different country right

24:31.220 --> 24:34.260
now and all of them slowly moving all of their stuff away.

24:34.260 --> 24:40.220
So I get all this like edging with the lawsuits is them buying time to make good their escape

24:40.220 --> 24:44.820
before they pull the trigger and everybody explodes, you know, but otherwise this doesn't

24:44.820 --> 24:45.820
make any sense.

24:45.820 --> 24:46.860
What are you doing?

24:46.860 --> 24:49.340
My pillow, you're wasting a lot of money.

24:49.340 --> 24:51.740
He must be making a lot too though.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.740
He must be.

24:52.740 --> 24:53.740
Yeah.

24:53.740 --> 24:55.540
But they're not going to, they don't make any sense.

24:55.540 --> 24:56.540
They're all magic.

24:56.540 --> 24:57.540
Yeah.

24:57.540 --> 24:58.540
I don't know.

24:58.540 --> 25:05.140
But also when you consider, I mean, not, you know, this guy, the my pillow guy is out there,

25:05.140 --> 25:06.140
man.

25:06.140 --> 25:07.140
Yeah.

25:07.140 --> 25:08.140
I can see that.

25:08.140 --> 25:11.660
And basically you listen to him talk for like two minutes and you're like, Oh yeah, I get

25:11.660 --> 25:13.140
why you'd make bad business decisions.

25:13.140 --> 25:14.480
Yeah, that's fair.

25:14.480 --> 25:20.060
Here he discusses in a rambling way, his story of having a prophetic dream about how he was

25:20.060 --> 25:21.060
going to meet.

25:21.060 --> 25:23.060
Why does everybody got dreams all of a sudden?

25:23.060 --> 25:24.060
Everyone.

25:24.060 --> 25:25.060
I'm sick of dreams.

25:25.060 --> 25:29.180
So he has a dream about how he's going to meet Trump and then he, he, he does.

25:29.180 --> 25:33.560
And look, I, and also I want to say really quick, he talks a bunch about how he's a recovering

25:33.560 --> 25:35.980
crack addict and I'm not beaten up on that.

25:35.980 --> 25:40.580
You're not making fun of that at all is just sort of background dressing to this story

25:40.580 --> 25:41.580
that's important.

25:41.580 --> 25:42.580
Good for you.

25:42.580 --> 25:45.160
I got up to 2015 and I had a dream.

25:45.160 --> 25:48.460
I get these dreams, these, these prophetic dreams.

25:48.460 --> 25:53.160
And one of them was that I would meet Donald Trump in a room and I'm going, why would I,

25:53.160 --> 25:56.780
why would I be meeting with Donald Trump in a room or whatever?

25:56.780 --> 25:59.260
I was just some, some guy from Minnesota.

25:59.260 --> 26:00.260
Right?

26:00.260 --> 26:04.000
Well, and two things in the summer, buying appointments kept happened to me.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.460
I was invited to the national prayer breakfast when, when Ben Carson was still running for

26:08.460 --> 26:15.700
president randomly picked out of 12 people to pray with him in a room and I wasn't even

26:15.700 --> 26:16.700
saved yet.

26:16.700 --> 26:17.700
I'm going in.

26:17.700 --> 26:18.700
I don't know how to pray.

26:18.700 --> 26:19.700
I don't know.

26:19.700 --> 26:23.900
You know, I was all nervous, but that was set up by God, you know, and, and then there

26:23.900 --> 26:31.180
were these things kept happening to the summer of 2016 and I'm on a plane to, to California

26:31.180 --> 26:36.840
and, and I'm, I'm sitting in the bulkhead and I opened this magazine that was about

26:36.840 --> 26:37.840
Donald Trump.

26:37.840 --> 26:43.660
And I said, you know, of course it was August or the late July of 2016.

26:43.660 --> 26:48.620
And I said, God, I said, if I'm supposed to be Donald Trump and be part of this, whatever's

26:48.620 --> 26:52.180
going on in our country, I need to know right now.

26:52.180 --> 26:56.100
And at that moment in time, my phone dinged and it was an email, Mike, will you, this

26:56.100 --> 26:57.100
is Donald Trump.

26:57.100 --> 26:59.520
Will you meet me in New York city at Trump tower?

26:59.520 --> 27:02.220
I go, God, you know, I don't believe that story.

27:02.220 --> 27:05.380
I don't believe a word of that bullshit.

27:05.380 --> 27:06.700
Not for one second.

27:06.700 --> 27:07.700
Yeah.

27:07.700 --> 27:08.700
Jesus Christ.

27:08.700 --> 27:09.700
Yeah.

27:09.700 --> 27:10.700
I'm, I'm, I'm not buying it.

27:10.700 --> 27:11.700
No.

27:11.700 --> 27:12.700
Uh, but it's fun.

27:12.700 --> 27:13.700
And the crowd will like it.

27:13.700 --> 27:14.700
Uh, yeah.

27:14.700 --> 27:20.460
But I just, this story is, is, is I just was listening to this, I'm like, Hey man, is this

27:20.460 --> 27:21.460
an event?

27:21.460 --> 27:22.460
Jesse Ventura character.

27:22.460 --> 27:26.900
It kind of feels fucking, this is Minnesota stuff, man.

27:26.900 --> 27:31.940
That's, that's what I'm saying is these dudes sound like Minnesota.

27:31.940 --> 27:35.940
It must be if they sound almost exactly the same.

27:35.940 --> 27:37.300
So many vocal similarities.

27:37.300 --> 27:38.300
Yeah.

27:38.300 --> 27:39.300
That's fair.

27:39.300 --> 27:40.300
That's fair.

27:40.300 --> 27:41.300
That's fair.

27:41.300 --> 27:42.300
I don't know.

27:42.300 --> 27:45.740
I, we need to move the pressure now up back onto religious people.

27:45.740 --> 27:49.900
You know, it used to be that when you were shitting on religion, that was like, that

27:49.900 --> 27:53.660
was often a discriminatory or being mean.

27:53.660 --> 27:56.380
Now we've got to push the responsibility back on there.

27:56.380 --> 27:59.820
Religious people, if you don't want to be made fun of, don't listen to the, my pillow

27:59.820 --> 28:00.820
guy.

28:00.820 --> 28:01.820
That's on you now.

28:01.820 --> 28:03.260
But the problem is he has so much money.

28:03.260 --> 28:04.260
Yeah.

28:04.260 --> 28:05.980
See, that's still on you.

28:05.980 --> 28:07.620
All religion jokes are fine.

28:07.620 --> 28:11.800
They are non-discriminatory until the majority of religious people are like, let's not do

28:11.800 --> 28:12.880
my pillow guy.

28:12.880 --> 28:13.880
I don't agree.

28:13.880 --> 28:14.880
I don't agree with that.

28:14.880 --> 28:15.880
Uh, axiom.

28:15.880 --> 28:17.580
I don't believe I don't agree with that.

28:17.580 --> 28:24.300
Uh, but that the issue comes down to like religion is fine, but this isn't about religion.

28:24.300 --> 28:26.900
This is about wanting a Christian nation.

28:26.900 --> 28:29.260
And my pillow guy is pretty clear about that.

28:29.260 --> 28:32.900
This has been a spiritual battle in our country for decades.

28:32.900 --> 28:38.060
This is a spiritual battle and we are in the, we're going to, this is the start of the greatest

28:38.060 --> 28:42.620
revival in history for one nation under God.

28:42.620 --> 28:44.020
And that God is Jesus.

28:44.020 --> 28:45.020
Amen.

28:45.020 --> 28:46.020
God bless you all.

28:46.020 --> 28:50.820
Jesus wouldn't even say, and we're going to look back and we're going to say that all

28:50.820 --> 28:53.500
had to happen in the name of Jesus.

28:53.500 --> 28:54.500
God bless you.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.500
Wow.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.500
Hallelujah.

28:56.500 --> 28:59.540
I love you, Mikey.

28:59.540 --> 29:01.940
You know, you want to know miracle of God.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.900
He went 60 seconds short.

29:03.900 --> 29:04.900
Haha.

29:04.900 --> 29:05.900
Good job.

29:05.900 --> 29:06.900
Whoa boy.

29:06.900 --> 29:08.300
Um, that guy is killing it.

29:08.300 --> 29:09.300
Yeah.

29:09.300 --> 29:13.780
I mean, almost everything that Mike is saying, uh, my pillow guy is saying is like, okay,

29:13.780 --> 29:14.780
yeah.

29:14.780 --> 29:18.180
I mean, if that was just at a, like a church revival or something like that, I don't think

29:18.180 --> 29:19.700
I'd have any issue with it.

29:19.700 --> 29:24.440
Like there's an awakening coming and you know, like God is, uh, you know, so important in

29:24.440 --> 29:25.440
our life.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.020
The problem is this is a political rally.

29:27.020 --> 29:32.020
You know, I know it's of a religious character, but like the reason you're having this rally

29:32.020 --> 29:33.620
is because Trump lost an election.

29:33.620 --> 29:34.620
Yeah.

29:34.620 --> 29:38.920
You're not having this because of like, no, no, he had a prophetic dream.

29:38.920 --> 29:40.260
It's the combination of the two.

29:40.260 --> 29:43.540
That's just fucking, uh, it's, uh, it's terrifying.

29:43.540 --> 29:44.540
Yeah.

29:44.540 --> 29:50.980
I think probably one of the reasons that I would have an easier time, like suggesting

29:50.980 --> 29:58.880
that this was, I suppose non-religious is just cause I know too much about how Christianity

29:58.880 --> 30:02.420
is supposed to work according to that book they say they like a lot.

30:02.420 --> 30:03.540
I've read a little bit of it.

30:03.540 --> 30:04.540
Yeah.

30:04.540 --> 30:09.060
I know too much about it and all of this stuff is like, we're Christians and we want a Christian

30:09.060 --> 30:10.060
nation.

30:10.060 --> 30:13.040
And I'm like, have you motherfuckers even opened it?

30:13.040 --> 30:15.620
And also here's a promo code from my pillow.

30:15.620 --> 30:16.620
Exactly.

30:16.620 --> 30:17.620
Exactly.

30:17.620 --> 30:23.140
And the thing that makes me even more scared really when I think about it is that, you

30:23.140 --> 30:26.740
know, there's this combination of this stuff, this Christian nationalism, and then it's

30:26.740 --> 30:34.060
also intersecting with this deification, uh, admiration and, and, and, and just love of

30:34.060 --> 30:41.460
not only Trump, but also general Flynn, who is somebody who's a hero, the QAnon folk and

30:41.460 --> 30:45.420
has been, uh, uh, Q, QE himself.

30:45.420 --> 30:50.380
And I hear Eric Metaxas, uh, teases, uh, Flynn's appearance in a little bit.

30:50.380 --> 30:55.340
We have general Michael Flynn is coming.

30:55.340 --> 31:00.220
Oh, Oh, then you've heard of him.

31:00.220 --> 31:02.100
Oh, I'm so impressed.

31:02.100 --> 31:03.100
Very good.

31:03.100 --> 31:04.540
You guys, uh, that's awesome.

31:04.540 --> 31:06.140
He is such a hero.

31:06.140 --> 31:08.220
He has been such hell.

31:08.220 --> 31:09.740
He's a Patriot.

31:09.740 --> 31:12.380
He believes in the Lord of the Bible.

31:12.380 --> 31:13.380
All right.

31:13.380 --> 31:18.660
A lot of the people, the center of this administration love Jesus.

31:18.660 --> 31:19.660
Don't you find that ironic?

31:19.660 --> 31:21.100
I don't know what he's even saying.

31:21.100 --> 31:22.820
I don't know what that's supposed to mean at all.

31:22.820 --> 31:26.420
No, but that's the, you, you asked for like, why is he hero?

31:26.420 --> 31:29.500
And then Metaxas told you because he believes in the God of the Bible.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.620
I really don't feel like that's enough.

31:31.620 --> 31:33.180
That's what, I mean, that's what they're saying.

31:33.180 --> 31:37.300
I think another problem I have is that they are cheering for thoroughly fictitious people.

31:37.300 --> 31:39.300
Flynn, the imaginary Flynn.

31:39.300 --> 31:40.300
Yeah.

31:40.300 --> 31:41.460
The imaginary Flynn is who they are cheering for.

31:41.460 --> 31:44.220
Michael Flynn has no resemblance to that character whatsoever.

31:44.220 --> 31:45.220
Yeah.

31:45.220 --> 31:50.340
He's a shit bag from way before if they knew his history, they would, if I were him, I

31:50.340 --> 31:53.940
would lean into the fan fiction way more than way more of the fan fiction.

31:53.940 --> 31:54.940
Yeah.

31:54.940 --> 31:55.940
Yeah.

31:55.940 --> 31:57.340
Your actual track record is fucking evil.

31:57.340 --> 31:58.340
Yeah.

31:58.340 --> 32:04.140
So now Metaxas brings out, uh, Rob Weaver and Irina Grossu, who are the, uh, the, uh,

32:04.140 --> 32:07.420
evangelical and the Catholic dreamers.

32:07.420 --> 32:13.500
And, uh, Rob, I would say his description of this vision that he had is a little bit

32:13.500 --> 32:14.500
lackluster.

32:14.500 --> 32:18.340
Um, this event will be going on for the next few hours, lots of speakers, more music.

32:18.340 --> 32:23.980
Um, but I want to tell you about how it started on November 5th, I was really, um, troubled

32:23.980 --> 32:25.980
by the election and what I knew was wrong.

32:25.980 --> 32:29.300
I think everybody in this country knows that something is wrong.

32:29.300 --> 32:32.900
Can I get an amen anyone?

32:32.900 --> 32:38.660
So I just call, I called out to God and I literally felt something pushing in my side

32:38.660 --> 32:39.660
in the morning.

32:39.660 --> 32:42.900
Quite frankly, I thought it was a remote, but it wasn't, you know, I, somebody, something

32:42.900 --> 32:43.900
was pushing.

32:43.900 --> 32:45.740
I heard a voice that said, it's not over.

32:45.740 --> 32:52.300
So can I hear it's not over because God said it's not over and the, and the next part of

32:52.300 --> 33:01.520
the vision, I sat down and I literally saw this and I saw marches going around the Capitol.

33:01.520 --> 33:06.000
I saw marches going around all six of the swing States that are also going on today.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
So hello.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
If you guys can hear us there.

33:08.000 --> 33:15.600
Um, so every one of them, let's, let's, let's give them a shout.

33:15.600 --> 33:20.380
So this was birthed from a vision or a miracle.

33:20.380 --> 33:21.940
That's not much of a vision.

33:21.940 --> 33:22.940
Wow.

33:22.940 --> 33:23.940
Yeah.

33:23.940 --> 33:27.060
So does that mean that, uh, God was poking him?

33:27.060 --> 33:31.100
Well, does that mean that for like, say the women's March was that inspired by God?

33:31.100 --> 33:32.100
Must've been.

33:32.100 --> 33:34.700
Or did, did, did the devil send that dream?

33:34.700 --> 33:35.700
Devil probably.

33:35.700 --> 33:39.700
Are God and the devil only sending competing dreams for rallies and shit now?

33:39.700 --> 33:45.040
Devil's clearly a better organizer too because the turnouts have been much larger to the

33:45.040 --> 33:50.060
point where, uh, these MAGA folk will just post pictures of left wing marches.

33:50.060 --> 33:51.060
Their marches.

33:51.060 --> 33:52.060
Yeah.

33:52.060 --> 33:53.060
It does seem strange.

33:53.060 --> 33:54.060
Yeah.

33:54.060 --> 33:55.940
They should, they should get in contact with the devil.

33:55.940 --> 33:56.940
He knows what's up.

33:56.940 --> 33:57.940
Yeah.

33:57.940 --> 33:58.940
He has a good street team.

33:58.940 --> 33:59.940
Yeah.

33:59.940 --> 34:05.700
The, the, uh, Robin arena are, are just there and you know, they had their vision.

34:05.700 --> 34:06.700
Hooray.

34:06.700 --> 34:07.700
Good for them.

34:07.700 --> 34:12.460
I had a dream of people walking around DC, which could never have been given to me from

34:12.460 --> 34:15.100
any other source other than God.

34:15.100 --> 34:16.100
And he got poked.

34:16.100 --> 34:17.560
Um, so that's true.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.020
Then they have a prayer.

34:19.020 --> 34:23.700
There's a lot of praying on this that I will, a lot of people through both of these rallies,

34:23.700 --> 34:26.880
everybody wants to get up there and do the Lord's blood to do a good prayer.

34:26.880 --> 34:33.220
You know, like how in the book it said, make sure that you pray loudly and performatively

34:33.220 --> 34:36.380
for others and not for God.

34:36.380 --> 34:42.240
It reminds me of like, okay, so like in early times, uh, in wrestling, you didn't want in

34:42.240 --> 34:46.740
your first match someone to go through a table, let's say, because then if you want to do

34:46.740 --> 34:53.020
that in the, the headline of the match, I feel like everybody is not respecting that

34:53.020 --> 34:54.900
in terms of the Lord's prayer.

34:54.900 --> 34:59.300
Like everyone's doing it, but everyone wants to, can you, I don't know.

34:59.300 --> 35:03.500
It's just, it feels less, save your Lord's prayer for the end of the show.

35:03.500 --> 35:04.500
Right.

35:04.500 --> 35:05.500
Or Flynn.

35:05.500 --> 35:06.900
I mean, he's clearly the headliner.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.940
It's his to do or not do.

35:08.940 --> 35:09.940
Right.

35:09.940 --> 35:10.940
I don't know.

35:10.940 --> 35:11.940
Anyway.

35:11.940 --> 35:15.380
Uh, they pray and uh, we get a prayer that Steve Pechenik would be very proud of.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.860
And then the stage gets interrupted.

35:17.860 --> 35:23.600
Father, I pray a special blessing on Melania Trump, one of the best first ladies we've

35:23.600 --> 35:25.180
ever had in history.

35:25.180 --> 35:27.720
And I'm so tired of people coming against her father.

35:27.720 --> 35:28.720
So go on.

35:28.720 --> 35:29.720
Why?

35:29.720 --> 35:33.500
I pray and her children and all the children in Jesus mighty name.

35:33.500 --> 35:34.500
Thank you Lord.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.500
Amen.

35:35.500 --> 35:36.500
Thank you guys.

35:36.500 --> 35:43.520
Oh, actually we want to introduce these Ollie Alexander from stop the seal.

35:43.520 --> 35:48.220
So Ali had sort of walked out on stage prayer.

35:48.220 --> 35:51.600
See the devil's a way better organizer.

35:51.600 --> 35:57.660
So Ali walks out along with Ed Martin of the Phyllis Schlafly Eagle Forum and they are

35:57.660 --> 36:01.740
apparently partnered with the, uh, the Jericho March.

36:01.740 --> 36:04.100
And that's kind of interesting.

36:04.100 --> 36:08.300
Um, because Ali starts talking about like, you know, Hey, we got, we got a lot of fun

36:08.300 --> 36:09.300
things coming up.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.300
We got general Flynn.

36:10.300 --> 36:13.660
Then he says something that really struck my ears.

36:13.660 --> 36:15.100
Today is going to be historic.

36:15.100 --> 36:16.100
We have general Flynn.

36:16.100 --> 36:20.660
We'll have the president of the sky or on the road and we got a couple of other characters

36:20.660 --> 36:22.620
in a spirit of unification.

36:22.620 --> 36:23.620
Thank y'all.

36:23.620 --> 36:26.340
You got a couple of other characters in the spirit of unification.

36:26.340 --> 36:27.820
That's very strange.

36:27.820 --> 36:32.820
Also the presidents in the sky, they, uh, they have, uh, been promoting that Trump is

36:32.820 --> 36:35.980
going to fly over in a Marine one.

36:35.980 --> 36:36.980
Great.

36:36.980 --> 36:40.500
Uh, and I think he does show up like during Flynn's speech, maybe.

36:40.500 --> 36:41.500
I don't know.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.060
Uh, there was a helicopter flying over at some point.

36:44.060 --> 36:45.060
Straight up.

36:45.060 --> 36:48.180
We're doing straight up fascist Nazi imagery.

36:48.180 --> 36:50.700
I honestly don't know if Trump was even in it.

36:50.700 --> 36:52.060
No, I doubt he was.

36:52.060 --> 36:53.060
Why would you?

36:53.060 --> 36:54.060
You wouldn't need to be.

36:54.060 --> 36:55.060
Yeah.

36:55.060 --> 36:57.460
They'll just see the helicopter and be like, eh, the president's in there.

36:57.460 --> 36:58.460
Why would you actually go?

36:58.460 --> 36:59.460
Symbol of president.

36:59.460 --> 37:02.100
What is he going to wave out the helicopter window?

37:02.100 --> 37:03.700
Get the fuck out of here.

37:03.700 --> 37:07.020
So Ed Martin of the Eagle forum, the Schleifly Eagles.

37:07.020 --> 37:08.020
Yes.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.020
Yeah.

37:09.020 --> 37:10.020
Yeah.

37:10.020 --> 37:11.860
He wants, while he's up on stage, he's a magnanimous type.

37:11.860 --> 37:12.860
Oh, of course.

37:12.860 --> 37:14.980
And he wants to give it up to the good media.

37:14.980 --> 37:17.740
Oh, Hey guys, we're gonna, we're gonna right now.

37:17.740 --> 37:21.400
I'd ask you to join me in prayer if you don't mind before we do, I want to say thank you

37:21.400 --> 37:29.180
to the Epic times for helping stream so much of this live Josh and, and RSBN bar, the brothers

37:29.180 --> 37:31.220
at RSBN brothers and sisters.

37:31.220 --> 37:34.020
Thank you for what you do to make it so people, yeah.

37:34.020 --> 37:37.220
And victory, victory TV and one America news.

37:37.220 --> 37:38.580
I mean, go down the list, right?

37:38.580 --> 37:43.820
And I just want to say when we gathered at the Capitol the other day around the world

37:43.820 --> 37:48.380
in Japan and China and Taiwan around the world, they're looking at America because we're a

37:48.380 --> 37:52.620
beacon on the Hill and we can't let the light go out.

37:52.620 --> 37:55.820
There cannot be the light going out for the world and for each other.

37:55.820 --> 37:56.820
Let's pray.

37:56.820 --> 38:03.260
One name conspicuous in its absence on that list, especially considering this dude standing

38:03.260 --> 38:12.440
right next to Ali Alexander, who's constantly on info, all these great media outlets really

38:12.440 --> 38:13.860
doing everything for it.

38:13.860 --> 38:15.620
I just, I can't get to them all.

38:15.620 --> 38:18.060
I'm going to name as many as I can.

38:18.060 --> 38:19.060
Epic is great.

38:19.060 --> 38:20.060
One American news.

38:20.060 --> 38:21.380
Look, I'm running out of time.

38:21.380 --> 38:22.380
I can't name anymore.

38:22.380 --> 38:25.020
I just want to say, you know, yeah.

38:25.020 --> 38:32.580
So look, they may not plug in for wars, but they are willing to let Alex give a little

38:32.580 --> 38:33.580
speech.

38:33.580 --> 38:34.580
Okay.

38:34.580 --> 38:36.140
And so at this point, the mission impossible theme plays.

38:36.140 --> 38:37.140
Oh no.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.140
Here it comes.

38:39.140 --> 38:45.460
Folks in the spirit of unity, I'd like to bring out my new friend, Alex Jones.

38:45.460 --> 38:53.260
Is it, I think his name is Alex Jones.

38:53.260 --> 38:55.780
Can't believe that many people cheer for him.

38:55.780 --> 39:06.340
You know, see this makes sense though.

39:06.340 --> 39:09.700
It does like as a wrestling, this is a wrestling show.

39:09.700 --> 39:10.700
This is what you want.

39:10.700 --> 39:14.780
You bring, you bring Alexander to be like, yeah, that's what you want.

39:14.780 --> 39:16.460
And that's why people are cheering.

39:16.460 --> 39:17.460
He is a star.

39:17.460 --> 39:18.460
He's a show.

39:18.460 --> 39:19.460
Yeah.

39:19.460 --> 39:20.460
Yeah.

39:20.460 --> 39:23.380
You want to hear Rob and Irena Grosu talk about their lackluster dream.

39:23.380 --> 39:25.780
I had a dream that people would be here.

39:25.780 --> 39:29.980
How excited are you going to get for the MyPillow guy telling a long story about his dream?

39:29.980 --> 39:35.580
I think it was, I think it was December 20th, 19th, no, this was November 11th.

39:35.580 --> 39:39.060
No, this was December 20th at 4.50 p.m.

39:39.060 --> 39:44.120
Eric Matexis is a good host or whatever to keep the thing moving along, but he's not

39:44.120 --> 39:45.700
going to get you riled up.

39:45.700 --> 39:46.700
No.

39:46.700 --> 39:47.700
Alex fucking Jones is.

39:47.700 --> 39:48.700
That's what he's going to do.

39:48.700 --> 39:49.700
Yeah.

39:49.700 --> 39:50.700
That's what he's there for.

39:50.700 --> 39:51.700
Yeah, exactly.

39:51.700 --> 39:52.700
Now it's embarrassing.

39:52.700 --> 39:53.700
Very.

39:53.700 --> 39:54.700
Didn't even get your name.

39:54.700 --> 39:59.060
Your rally is now the one that allowed Alex to speak at it.

39:59.060 --> 40:00.740
So congratulations for that.

40:00.740 --> 40:01.740
Yep.

40:01.740 --> 40:02.960
But Alex does what Alex does.

40:02.960 --> 40:08.660
And that is more or less just yell his ass off about nonsense.

40:08.660 --> 40:09.660
Like what they want.

40:09.660 --> 40:10.660
Applause line.

40:10.660 --> 40:11.660
Exactly.

40:11.660 --> 40:12.660
Applause line.

40:12.660 --> 40:13.660
Applause line.

40:13.660 --> 40:14.660
And Jesus Christ is King!

40:14.660 --> 40:25.940
Not David Rockefeller, not Bill Gates, not Barack Obama, not Joe Biden, but Jesus Christ

40:25.940 --> 40:26.940
is King!

40:26.940 --> 40:35.740
And God gave us and rose up Donald Trump to stand against the enemy and draw out the enemy.

40:35.740 --> 40:41.420
So as dark as some of these days are, understand, this is the beginning of the great revival

40:41.420 --> 40:44.460
before the Antichrist comes!

40:44.460 --> 40:45.460
Two quick points.

40:45.460 --> 40:47.180
That's not how it works in the Bible!

40:47.180 --> 40:48.180
Two quick points.

40:48.180 --> 40:50.940
I thought Obama was the Antichrist, Alex.

40:50.940 --> 40:51.940
Don't worry about it.

40:51.940 --> 40:55.260
And the second point, I believe on our last episode, he was calling Marilyn Monroe a cum

40:55.260 --> 40:56.260
dump.

40:56.260 --> 40:57.260
He was doing that.

40:57.260 --> 40:58.260
Yeah, yeah.

40:58.260 --> 40:59.260
Where are we?

40:59.260 --> 41:00.260
There's a little bit going on.

41:00.260 --> 41:01.260
What are we doing?

41:01.260 --> 41:07.620
I like the idea of Jesus standing next to Alex Jones giving him that, hey, but I'm about

41:07.620 --> 41:08.620
peace.

41:08.620 --> 41:10.780
I was going to feed all these people.

41:10.780 --> 41:14.580
Okay, well, let's just skip past that part then.

41:14.580 --> 41:15.980
Let's just get to the Book of Revelations.

41:15.980 --> 41:18.020
You realize there isn't a revival before-

41:18.020 --> 41:19.020
Hey, Jesus.

41:19.020 --> 41:20.020
No.

41:20.020 --> 41:21.020
Do you understand?

41:21.020 --> 41:22.580
I'm even going to blow your mind a little bit more with this.

41:22.580 --> 41:23.580
Jesus.

41:23.580 --> 41:24.580
Jesus.

41:24.580 --> 41:25.580
No one's going to clap for that weak shit.

41:25.580 --> 41:31.020
The Antichrist convinces almost all Christians to believe in him over-

41:31.020 --> 41:33.140
We got a blowout sale.

41:33.140 --> 41:38.820
It's actually almost like, so they would focus on a single person instead of the Lord and

41:38.820 --> 41:44.780
really be like, this person is the true leader and we're going to give all of our allegiances

41:44.780 --> 41:47.300
to him without thinking about it.

41:47.300 --> 41:48.300
And then because of that-

41:48.300 --> 41:50.300
You sound like a damn globalist.

41:50.300 --> 41:51.300
You know what?

41:51.300 --> 41:52.300
You're right.

41:52.300 --> 41:53.300
I'm going to have to go.

41:53.300 --> 41:56.420
So it turns out we're in Revelation, according to Alex.

41:56.420 --> 41:59.340
And again, this is all just applause lines.

41:59.340 --> 42:05.340
World government, implantable microchips, Satanism, it's out of the open, the Bible

42:05.340 --> 42:13.140
is fulfilled, Revelation is fulfilled, Jesus Christ is fulfilled, God Almighty is in charge,

42:13.140 --> 42:16.260
and we follow that mighty God.

42:16.260 --> 42:18.260
Is this who?

42:18.260 --> 42:24.620
You look at the miserable globalist, you look at people like Bill Gates, and you look at

42:24.620 --> 42:32.220
people like Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of them, they are miserable slaves of Satan.

42:32.220 --> 42:38.420
And we pray for them and hope that the Holy Spirit can still touch their soul.

42:38.420 --> 42:41.500
Like this is embarrassing, but you get why people enjoy this.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.500
Oh yeah, this is great.

42:43.500 --> 42:44.780
It's incredibly dumb.

42:44.780 --> 42:45.780
This is what you go for.

42:45.780 --> 42:46.780
It's exciting.

42:46.780 --> 42:47.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:47.780 --> 42:48.780
This is star quality.

42:48.780 --> 42:49.780
Totally.

42:49.780 --> 42:50.780
Whatever it is.

42:50.780 --> 42:54.760
But you can also tell if you watch this that it really takes a lot out of him.

42:54.760 --> 43:00.300
Like you can tell that he's pushing to get all this yelling going.

43:00.300 --> 43:01.300
His voice is-

43:01.300 --> 43:02.300
He's exhausted.

43:02.300 --> 43:03.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:03.300 --> 43:04.300
This is difficult.

43:04.300 --> 43:05.300
Yeah.

43:05.300 --> 43:06.300
He's not a young man anymore.

43:06.300 --> 43:08.640
No, but you got to do it.

43:08.640 --> 43:19.520
We pray for President Donald John Trump in this incredibly serious moment.

43:19.520 --> 43:24.700
And we pray for all the women in America who the system's trying to lie to to kill their

43:24.700 --> 43:25.700
babies.

43:25.700 --> 43:31.500
And we say, don't kill your babies.

43:31.500 --> 43:34.780
The enemy has been forced out in the open.

43:34.780 --> 43:37.060
World government is here.

43:37.060 --> 43:42.900
And the system is publicly stealing this election from the biggest landslide and the biggest

43:42.900 --> 43:46.100
political realignment since 1776.

43:46.100 --> 43:49.660
I mean, just every single line.

43:49.660 --> 43:58.460
He knows how to frame a sentence in a way that will end with like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:58.460 --> 44:03.180
Not in like a necessarily bad way, but like, you know, you see comedians who like, you

44:03.180 --> 44:08.580
know, structuring a line, you know, like, oh, what you're saying is funny, but the way

44:08.580 --> 44:12.260
you've written that or the way you're saying that is not funny.

44:12.260 --> 44:15.860
It doesn't lead people to the reaction that you're looking for.

44:15.860 --> 44:21.180
Whereas Alex, every single sentence that he's saying is specifically meant to make people

44:21.180 --> 44:23.060
yell at the end of it.

44:23.060 --> 44:29.220
And that's, I mean, don't do this in the middle of your event.

44:29.220 --> 44:30.940
I don't think it's a good idea.

44:30.940 --> 44:33.620
Like you're going to make everyone else look like trash.

44:33.620 --> 44:36.140
It's poor, it's poor quality.

44:36.140 --> 44:38.180
Just don't let him on your show at all.

44:38.180 --> 44:45.420
How is it that I could, I could run a better fucking rally just using the same principles

44:45.420 --> 44:47.940
of booking a show, a comedy show.

44:47.940 --> 44:51.140
I bet you, I bet you couldn't though, cause you'd have no idea who any of these people

44:51.140 --> 44:52.140
are.

44:52.140 --> 44:53.140
Oh, that's true.

44:53.140 --> 44:54.140
I wouldn't have them at my rally.

44:54.140 --> 44:57.540
You'd see a bunch of random names on a list like, what, I don't know what this person's

44:57.540 --> 44:58.540
like.

44:58.540 --> 44:59.540
I wonder if I could do that.

44:59.540 --> 45:00.540
That would be an interesting challenge.

45:00.540 --> 45:04.420
I'll take maybe 10 seconds of each of these people speaking and I'll see if I can't make

45:04.420 --> 45:06.420
a lineup out of them that would make more sense.

45:06.420 --> 45:07.820
That would be a great idea.

45:07.820 --> 45:08.820
Wouldn't that be a fun game?

45:08.820 --> 45:09.820
Yeah.

45:09.820 --> 45:10.820
Yeah.

45:10.820 --> 45:11.820
I might try and put that together.

45:11.820 --> 45:12.820
That'd be fun.

45:12.820 --> 45:13.820
All right.

45:13.820 --> 45:18.540
So anyway, the big problem that I see with all of this, and I'm going to keep stressing

45:18.540 --> 45:24.300
this, is the insistence on what you describe as like Christian nationalism and the idea

45:24.300 --> 45:30.220
that your God is the only real God and you know, like just imagining being someone who

45:30.220 --> 45:38.220
is not a, you know, a Christian of this stripe in the audience and think about how uncomfortable

45:38.220 --> 45:39.760
you'd be.

45:39.760 --> 45:42.420
Our God is the God of the universe.

45:42.420 --> 45:51.420
Our God is the God of strength and honor and will and God is in control and God is on our

45:51.420 --> 45:54.180
side.

45:54.180 --> 45:58.420
Because it's not like, it's the Jericho march and you know, there is a religious character

45:58.420 --> 46:03.700
to it, but it's also partnered with Ali Alexander in Stop the Steal and the Phyllis Schlafly

46:03.700 --> 46:04.700
Eagle Forum.

46:04.700 --> 46:08.500
You know, like it's not just, it's just, it's terrifying.

46:08.500 --> 46:12.660
I mean, everything that they're saying though is screaming out a different form of we cannot

46:12.660 --> 46:14.700
coexist.

46:14.700 --> 46:16.780
We will not accept coexisting.

46:16.780 --> 46:18.380
It's us or nothing.

46:18.380 --> 46:19.380
That's it.

46:19.380 --> 46:20.380
Yeah.

46:20.380 --> 46:25.900
There is a, and to be fair, so far the main speakers that we've heard are the MyPillowGuy

46:25.900 --> 46:26.900
and Alex.

46:26.900 --> 46:27.900
Sure.

46:27.900 --> 46:33.900
And it's not, you know, to be indicative of like everybody is unable to coexist.

46:33.900 --> 46:37.460
These voices that are being welcomed here are fucked.

46:37.460 --> 46:38.460
Yeah.

46:38.460 --> 46:42.660
I mean, but even then, like the best you could say for so many of these people would be like,

46:42.660 --> 46:47.340
Hey, hey, we can coexist so long as you stay under my boot, then we'll be fine.

46:47.340 --> 46:48.340
Yeah.

46:48.340 --> 46:53.760
So many people who have no idea about anything that has to do with the religion of Christianity

46:53.760 --> 46:57.420
think that the crucifixion was a bad thing.

46:57.420 --> 47:00.300
You know, like, Oh no, if only we could have stopped it.

47:00.300 --> 47:01.900
No, that's not how it works.

47:01.900 --> 47:02.900
No, no.

47:02.900 --> 47:03.900
It was almost like crucial.

47:03.900 --> 47:04.900
Yeah.

47:04.900 --> 47:10.860
No one really thinks that, you know, it was necessary for the atonement and it was almost

47:10.860 --> 47:12.540
preordained if you will.

47:12.540 --> 47:13.540
Yeah.

47:13.540 --> 47:15.300
So, but Alex also understands this.

47:15.300 --> 47:16.300
Okay.

47:16.300 --> 47:17.300
Good.

47:17.300 --> 47:19.460
He's not, he's not one of these guys who would have like tackled the Romans or something.

47:19.460 --> 47:20.860
So Judas is a good guy then.

47:20.860 --> 47:21.860
I don't know.

47:21.860 --> 47:22.860
Okay.

47:22.860 --> 47:25.900
Christ's crucifixion was not our defeat.

47:25.900 --> 47:30.340
It was our greatest victory.

47:30.340 --> 47:38.300
When he rose again on the third day, he broke the chains of hell and death.

47:38.300 --> 47:41.300
We have the deed to this planet.

47:41.300 --> 47:49.260
We have the deed to eternal life and we praise Jesus Christ and the father.

47:49.260 --> 47:50.260
Wow.

47:50.260 --> 47:51.260
That's scary.

47:51.260 --> 47:52.260
Yeah.

47:52.260 --> 47:53.260
That's terrifying.

47:53.260 --> 47:54.260
He has the deed to the planet.

47:54.260 --> 47:55.260
Yeah.

47:55.260 --> 47:56.620
I don't think that somebody could scream at me.

47:56.620 --> 47:57.620
No.

47:57.620 --> 48:01.580
So in this next clip, Alex gets into the first amendment and you know, stuff about like freedom

48:01.580 --> 48:03.220
of religion.

48:03.220 --> 48:05.860
But he's also gone too fast.

48:05.860 --> 48:08.220
He's, he's, he's burned a lot of gas.

48:08.220 --> 48:09.220
Yeah.

48:09.220 --> 48:10.220
He's, he's out of it.

48:10.220 --> 48:11.220
Yeah.

48:11.220 --> 48:13.220
And so he has a little trouble.

48:13.220 --> 48:18.080
Congress shall make no law, establishing the establishment of religion or prohibiting the

48:18.080 --> 48:25.540
free exercise thereof, all Congress shall make no law, respecting the establishment

48:25.540 --> 48:29.780
of religion or the free exercise thereof.

48:29.780 --> 48:34.020
Our forebearers did not have separation of church and state as they spin it.

48:34.020 --> 48:38.700
It means the state has no jurisdiction over any of us.

48:38.700 --> 48:39.700
That's not true.

48:39.700 --> 48:46.500
That's quite, quite an extension of the, uh, the, the state has no jurisdiction over any

48:46.500 --> 48:47.500
of us.

48:47.500 --> 48:51.860
I'm pretty sure they weren't, I'm pretty sure they weren't like Congress shall make no law

48:51.860 --> 48:57.220
respect with respect to the free exercise of religion.

48:57.220 --> 49:00.060
But what that actually means is Christians are free of laws.

49:00.060 --> 49:02.220
We get to live however we want to.

49:02.220 --> 49:03.220
Yeah.

49:03.220 --> 49:10.460
If you can just create an excuse that's religiously based in heavy quotes, then the state can't

49:10.460 --> 49:13.100
do anything like you can kill for your religion.

49:13.100 --> 49:14.100
Yeah.

49:14.100 --> 49:15.100
Yeah.

49:15.100 --> 49:16.100
I don't, uh, I don't know.

49:16.100 --> 49:18.060
I feel like that's what he's saying pretty much.

49:18.060 --> 49:19.060
Yeah.

49:19.060 --> 49:22.940
But also it's like these thoughts are not fleshed out.

49:22.940 --> 49:23.940
It's just yelling.

49:23.940 --> 49:24.940
Yeah.

49:24.940 --> 49:25.940
And they're there for people to scream.

49:25.940 --> 49:26.940
Hooray.

49:26.940 --> 49:27.940
Yeah, you bet.

49:27.940 --> 49:28.940
Yeah, you bet.

49:28.940 --> 49:31.700
And here was Alex's lightning rod that he put out in order to get attention.

49:31.700 --> 49:32.700
Okay.

49:32.700 --> 49:38.940
So I don't know who's going to the white house in 38 days, but I sure know this Joe Biden

49:38.940 --> 49:44.860
is a globalist and Joe Biden will be removed one way or another.

49:44.860 --> 49:45.860
Nice.

49:45.860 --> 49:49.180
Cause that was the clip that got the big amount of attention on the internet because people

49:49.180 --> 49:52.820
fairly accurately interpret that as a veiled threat towards Joe Biden.

49:52.820 --> 49:53.820
Oh, why is that?

49:53.820 --> 49:58.060
I get that response, but it's also exactly why Alex said what he said.

49:58.060 --> 50:01.780
It's almost certainly not legally actionable as a threat and if the secret service end

50:01.780 --> 50:03.980
up talking to him about it, that's even better.

50:03.980 --> 50:05.140
That's super cool for him.

50:05.140 --> 50:06.140
Yeah.

50:06.140 --> 50:07.140
Alex would love that.

50:07.140 --> 50:10.220
I got a visit from the secret service, so you know that what I said was powerful.

50:10.220 --> 50:11.220
Yup.

50:11.220 --> 50:12.220
They're scared of me.

50:12.220 --> 50:13.220
Yup.

50:13.220 --> 50:15.100
Honestly, when I heard that, I thought it was pretty tame for Alex.

50:15.100 --> 50:19.140
And considering how up in arms people were like, there are articles written about it.

50:19.140 --> 50:22.660
Like, yeah, I guess it takes on a slightly different character when he's yelling those

50:22.660 --> 50:25.440
things in front of a crowd who then cheer.

50:25.440 --> 50:29.580
But if you heard Alex say this and you think that's him crossing a line, all that means

50:29.580 --> 50:31.340
is that you never listened to it.

50:31.340 --> 50:32.340
Yeah.

50:32.340 --> 50:36.040
I was, I was going to say, I saw his name in the news and I was like, well, can't check

50:36.040 --> 50:42.020
on that, but if that's what it was for, Dan, I have surprising news for a lot of people.

50:42.020 --> 50:43.020
Yeah.

50:43.020 --> 50:45.300
And that line there is an attention trap.

50:45.300 --> 50:46.300
Yeah.

50:46.300 --> 50:48.820
That is a trap that people fall into.

50:48.820 --> 50:50.060
And I understand why they do.

50:50.060 --> 50:55.340
And I honestly don't know if the best thing to do is ignore it, but if you pay attention

50:55.340 --> 50:57.700
to it, that gives him free press.

50:57.700 --> 51:03.780
And that's why he implied on a stage that Biden would be removed one way or another.

51:03.780 --> 51:04.780
Right.

51:04.780 --> 51:10.360
I mean, I guess with Alex, the reality is he has nothing to back that thread up with

51:10.360 --> 51:11.740
at all.

51:11.740 --> 51:15.380
And all he gets from it is attention for making that threat.

51:15.380 --> 51:20.940
And you know, I understand why you'd be like, Hey, what the fuck is going on here?

51:20.940 --> 51:26.780
But at the same time, it's like, Alex is going, Alex makes money because he says stupid shit

51:26.780 --> 51:27.780
like that.

51:27.780 --> 51:28.980
And you go, Oh my God, no.

51:28.980 --> 51:30.700
And then we do it all in two months.

51:30.700 --> 51:31.700
Yeah.

51:31.700 --> 51:32.700
Yeah.

51:32.700 --> 51:33.700
I mean, that's kind of the theme of the show.

51:33.700 --> 51:35.100
Yeah.

51:35.100 --> 51:39.980
So Alex slows down a little bit and wants to talk about my man, G-dubs, George Washington.

51:39.980 --> 51:46.140
Oh, our, our great first president, we literally are here on his farm.

51:46.140 --> 51:47.260
That's where we're at.

51:47.260 --> 51:53.500
George Washington didn't want to be king and every serve two terms that set that precedent.

51:53.500 --> 51:54.500
He left.

51:54.500 --> 51:55.500
He was a very quiet man.

51:55.500 --> 51:59.820
I didn't talk about his beliefs when he was a Christian, but those that knew him privately

51:59.820 --> 52:03.420
knew, he knew God controlled battlefields.

52:03.420 --> 52:05.060
God controlled governments.

52:05.060 --> 52:12.780
God controls the games and all his success was because of his love of God.

52:12.780 --> 52:17.380
So this rally is being held on the national mall in Washington, DC, George Washington's

52:17.380 --> 52:21.880
farm is now a national landmark called Mount Vernon, which is about 16 miles South and

52:21.880 --> 52:22.880
in the state of Virginia.

52:22.880 --> 52:23.900
Nah, come on now.

52:23.900 --> 52:27.580
As for Washington's religious beliefs, that's actually a matter that even scholars in the

52:27.580 --> 52:30.500
field of George Washington studies aren't fully settled on.

52:30.500 --> 52:31.500
Yeah.

52:31.500 --> 52:32.500
Mostly because of what Alex brings up.

52:32.500 --> 52:36.220
He is correct, like Washington was really private about his beliefs.

52:36.220 --> 52:40.660
The point is Alex can make that claim about Washington knowing that God runs everything

52:40.660 --> 52:44.900
and all this and the seriousness of his beliefs, but Alex could never back that up.

52:44.900 --> 52:46.900
He could never prove that.

52:46.900 --> 52:47.900
Why would you?

52:47.900 --> 52:49.540
Yeah, you just make that claim and it's good.

52:49.540 --> 52:54.380
I mean, that's good for him because like, you know, even if he were talking to a Washington

52:54.380 --> 52:58.820
scholar, they would be able to tease out more nuance to his beliefs.

52:58.820 --> 53:00.580
They wouldn't be able to be like, you're lying.

53:00.580 --> 53:01.580
Yeah.

53:01.580 --> 53:07.580
I mean, looking at what they do with a guy who is alive and real and how they've created

53:07.580 --> 53:13.620
a false story for him, we have no chance of them not trying to claim the founding father

53:13.620 --> 53:16.220
said fucking whatever it is they want, you know?

53:16.220 --> 53:17.220
True.

53:17.220 --> 53:19.820
So Alex gets back to talking about how his God is the real God.

53:19.820 --> 53:20.820
Sure.

53:20.820 --> 53:26.740
So never forget, we worship the true God that created the universe and all of us.

53:26.740 --> 53:32.820
And the satanic globalist trying to take control of us and trying to play God are fallen and

53:32.820 --> 53:33.820
are failed.

53:33.820 --> 53:39.800
And we need to just keep our eyes on Christ and never back down and never surrender.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.940
Keep your eyes on Christ and away from politics.

53:42.940 --> 53:47.420
Like he said, you remember how he said that.

53:47.420 --> 53:49.500
Also get ready to overthrow the government.

53:49.500 --> 53:50.500
Yeah, exactly.

53:50.500 --> 53:55.400
I don't recall him being like, Hey, render unto Caesar what Caesar's cause we're going

53:55.400 --> 53:56.800
to fuck him up later.

53:56.800 --> 54:01.260
So you were making a joke about Jesus standing next to Alex on stage.

54:01.260 --> 54:02.260
He's not there.

54:02.260 --> 54:03.260
He's not there.

54:03.260 --> 54:04.260
But somebody is.

54:04.260 --> 54:05.260
And that's Owen Schroyer.

54:05.260 --> 54:06.260
Okay.

54:06.260 --> 54:07.260
Slight downgrade.

54:07.260 --> 54:08.260
A little bit down.

54:08.260 --> 54:09.260
A little bit down.

54:09.260 --> 54:13.340
Owen Schroyer is standing there on stage and Alex hands the mic off to him.

54:13.340 --> 54:14.340
Oh no.

54:14.340 --> 54:15.340
Now listen to this clip.

54:15.340 --> 54:16.340
Oh no, Owen.

54:16.340 --> 54:20.140
Listen to this clip of Alex saying, Oh, he's going to let Owen talk because it sounds like

54:20.140 --> 54:21.460
he's going to do a fucking ad.

54:21.460 --> 54:22.460
Okay.

54:22.460 --> 54:25.380
He doesn't, but it sounds like he's about to do an ad.

54:25.380 --> 54:28.140
I'm going to turn this over to my buddy for two minutes.

54:28.140 --> 54:34.020
My great co-hosted in full wars.com, Owen Schroyer, and then the next great, the next

54:34.020 --> 54:38.340
great guests are coming up here, but remember this, it really sounds like the next great

54:38.340 --> 54:39.340
guest.

54:39.340 --> 54:40.340
Yeah.

54:40.340 --> 54:42.660
It sounds like he's about to remember this self-prostate guard.

54:42.660 --> 54:48.060
We are having our Easter sale in December.

54:48.060 --> 54:52.540
So Alex finishes up his stuff before he ends off the baton to Owen.

54:52.540 --> 54:55.780
You know how 666 is the devil's number?

54:55.780 --> 54:56.780
Sure.

54:56.780 --> 54:57.780
Why not?

54:57.780 --> 54:58.780
1776.

54:58.780 --> 54:59.780
That's God's number.

54:59.780 --> 55:00.780
Yeah.

55:00.780 --> 55:01.780
It doesn't sound right.

55:01.780 --> 55:06.860
God ordained this Republic to stand against the satanic empires, the Nazis and the communists

55:06.860 --> 55:08.420
and others.

55:08.420 --> 55:16.940
And so 1776 is God's number of victory over the satanic 1984.

55:16.940 --> 55:19.300
God bless you all.

55:19.300 --> 55:20.300
And I salute you.

55:20.300 --> 55:22.140
Thank you, Jesus.

55:22.140 --> 55:24.160
And that's, uh, that's Alex's speech.

55:24.160 --> 55:26.100
So important numbers to God.

55:26.100 --> 55:27.100
Yeah.

55:27.100 --> 55:28.100
He's a real numbers guy.

55:28.100 --> 55:29.100
Uh huh.

55:29.100 --> 55:33.380
1776 is God's number because the United States was ordained by God to stand up to Nazis.

55:33.380 --> 55:34.380
Yep.

55:34.380 --> 55:35.380
I remember that.

55:35.380 --> 55:36.580
There's a little complexity to that.

55:36.580 --> 55:37.580
Uh huh.

55:37.580 --> 55:41.820
I mean, so what happened then whenever we grabbed all their scientists and didn't, and

55:41.820 --> 55:44.620
then weren't like, Hey, could you guys quit being Nazi?

55:44.620 --> 55:45.980
And we're just like, eh, you guys are great.

55:45.980 --> 55:49.860
Can you phrase that question in number form?

55:49.860 --> 55:52.260
1944?

55:52.260 --> 55:55.620
So Owen, he's not great after that.

55:55.620 --> 55:56.620
Cause how could you be?

55:56.620 --> 55:57.620
Sure.

55:57.620 --> 56:00.540
I mean, Alex just yelled the applause line after applause line.

56:00.540 --> 56:04.380
He's worn out the audience for like excitement.

56:04.380 --> 56:06.580
So Owen, like this is so great.

56:06.580 --> 56:08.540
God, what a sad man.

56:08.540 --> 56:12.080
Boy, look at what we have here today.

56:12.080 --> 56:18.380
What started with one man on public access television is now millions of Americans in

56:18.380 --> 56:21.660
the streets of DC.

56:21.660 --> 56:22.660
So many problems.

56:22.660 --> 56:25.820
Started with one man on local access television.

56:25.820 --> 56:29.420
He's pretending that Alex did all of this.

56:29.420 --> 56:30.960
Like he created this entire event.

56:30.960 --> 56:32.760
They're only all there for him.

56:32.760 --> 56:37.260
And then he's also saying that there's millions of people there, which there are not.

56:37.260 --> 56:38.260
Oh boy.

56:38.260 --> 56:39.260
There are not.

56:39.260 --> 56:40.260
There are too many.

56:40.260 --> 56:41.260
Owen, Owen, Owen.

56:41.260 --> 56:42.260
Yeah.

56:42.260 --> 56:43.260
Oh boy.

56:43.260 --> 56:44.940
So we got to do a little admin at this point.

56:44.940 --> 56:50.260
Eric Metaxas comes out and he's got to maybe, you know, reset the room a little bit.

56:50.260 --> 56:51.620
People got a little bit too excited.

56:51.620 --> 56:55.580
It's like at the dance hall, the DJ can only play so many bangers in a row before you got

56:55.580 --> 56:59.220
to have one where everybody gets to sit down and maybe slow dance, you know, that kind

56:59.220 --> 57:00.220
of thing.

57:00.220 --> 57:04.100
I think people got too excited and they're whipping their flags all around and it's a

57:04.100 --> 57:05.100
problem.

57:05.100 --> 57:07.060
I've got a little housekeeping.

57:07.060 --> 57:11.700
They said to me that these flags in the front, when there, when there's a speaker, they're

57:11.700 --> 57:16.540
blocking the video and this is being live streamed all over the place.

57:16.540 --> 57:21.220
So if you could just drop the flags whenever the speaker is speaking or the prayer is praying,

57:21.220 --> 57:22.620
dropping them means taking them down.

57:22.620 --> 57:26.020
You probably don't realize the term drop means down with the flag.

57:26.020 --> 57:27.300
Could you do that?

57:27.300 --> 57:28.300
Flags is what is that?

57:28.300 --> 57:29.300
A Korean flag.

57:29.300 --> 57:30.780
Bring that down.

57:30.780 --> 57:31.780
What is that?

57:31.780 --> 57:32.780
A Kung Fu martial arts flag.

57:32.780 --> 57:33.780
Bring that down.

57:33.780 --> 57:34.780
Come on.

57:34.780 --> 57:35.780
Seriously.

57:35.780 --> 57:36.780
Cause we want everybody.

57:36.780 --> 57:37.780
There's a lot of people who couldn't be here.

57:37.780 --> 57:38.780
They're watching this on live stream.

57:38.780 --> 57:39.780
Yeah.

57:39.780 --> 57:41.820
Put these flags down.

57:41.820 --> 57:45.900
That's a weird, that's a weird little bit of just tossed off.

57:45.900 --> 57:47.180
I don't know what's going on.

57:47.180 --> 57:48.180
Yeah.

57:48.180 --> 57:49.180
Yeah.

57:49.180 --> 57:51.200
I don't know what that flag he's referring to is.

57:51.200 --> 57:57.940
And also there is a brown station wagon with its horns going off right now.

57:57.940 --> 57:58.940
Could somebody please?

57:58.940 --> 58:04.100
It's a brown station wagon license plate CE 9429.

58:04.100 --> 58:05.100
Yeah.

58:05.100 --> 58:08.980
So, uh, he gets, he gets these flags down right in time.

58:08.980 --> 58:14.220
For the man, the myth, Ali Alexander to come out and give a little bit of a speech.

58:14.220 --> 58:19.980
And he's, he's basically out here saying, Hey man, look, now is the time that moral

58:19.980 --> 58:25.660
people, moral people are deciding whether or not this presidency and this government

58:25.660 --> 58:27.300
itself is legit.

58:27.300 --> 58:28.300
Great.

58:28.300 --> 58:30.140
I think that we are making history.

58:30.140 --> 58:37.180
I think that today, today is when moral Americans are deciding whether our government is legitimate

58:37.180 --> 58:39.700
or illegitimate.

58:39.700 --> 58:44.520
I think that this is a signal to the deep state that we're not going to tolerate a Joe

58:44.520 --> 58:45.520
Biden presidency.

58:45.520 --> 58:47.180
I'm going to tolerate it.

58:47.180 --> 58:48.180
Yeah.

58:48.180 --> 58:52.220
So he's saying essentially that all of us are going to determine whether or not this

58:52.220 --> 58:56.900
is a legitimate government and the deciding thing will be whether or not Trump is installed

58:56.900 --> 58:57.900
again.

58:57.900 --> 58:59.620
And great.

58:59.620 --> 59:02.060
Ali is a little threatening.

59:02.060 --> 59:07.620
There's an interesting thing that I noticed through these two rallies.

59:07.620 --> 59:14.340
The one with the women for Trump is largely not about destroying the GOP.

59:14.340 --> 59:15.340
Sure.

59:15.340 --> 59:17.540
Ali is threatening the GOP.

59:17.540 --> 59:18.540
I like it.

59:18.540 --> 59:24.900
I don't know if every speaker here is interested in destroying the Republican party, but Ali,

59:24.900 --> 59:29.460
who's one of the organizers of this, is definitely open to that discussion.

59:29.460 --> 59:31.540
I think it's a great discussion to have.

59:31.540 --> 59:37.580
So not only will he destroy the GOP, he will also shut down all of the cities in this country.

59:37.580 --> 59:38.920
All of them, Ali.

59:38.920 --> 59:42.340
Our truckers will shut down the city.

59:42.340 --> 59:43.340
Unionize!

59:43.340 --> 59:44.340
Why isn't anybody clapping?

59:44.340 --> 59:50.860
We will build and occupy DC full of patriots here, won't we?

59:50.860 --> 59:57.260
We can do all things through Christ who strengthens us.

59:57.260 --> 01:00:02.340
So to my Republican colleagues, put down those flags so that they can stream.

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:03.340
Please.

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:04.340
Dude.

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.340
Yes, you.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:06.340
Thank you.

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:09.620
Really hung up on those flags.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:14.940
How can you want to be led by such whiners like these people?

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:15.940
Very soft.

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:17.660
They're such whiners.

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:23.640
So Ali, he's gonna shut everything down and he's gonna do this with the help of cool media

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.640
outlets.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:27.780
A few shout out to RSBN.

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:28.780
Whoa.

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:29.780
RSBN.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:31.660
And One American News.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.380
One American News.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.380
And Newsmax.

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:35.380
Newsmax.

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.460
That was loud.

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:39.460
Epic Time.

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.500
Epic Time.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.500
NTDTV.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:46.000
Never heard of it.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.500
We don't need Fox News anymore, do we?

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.500
No.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.500
No Infowars.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:55.140
You just had Alex Jones up here.

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:56.460
You basically work there.

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:59.220
Why didn't you say Infowars?

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:02.620
Alex's whole premise is like, no one will say Infowars because we're too dangerous.

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.620
You have Ali Alexander.

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:09.860
You guys won't say Infowars because you're too toxic.

01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:11.700
That is something that is very consistent.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:12.700
That is so funny.

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:19.300
He is still on the outside, even with this completely wacky media landscape.

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:23.460
So Ali is really thrilled about this guy named Mo Brooks, who apparently has come out, he's

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:29.240
a member of Congress in the House, and he's said that, hey, look, even if the Electoral

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:34.100
College comes back and says, hey, Biden's the president, I'm gonna object.

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.980
You got it, man.

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:36.980
You took him down.

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.900
Ali is excited.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:42.860
Thank God for Congressman Mo Brooks.

01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:50.780
He has said that he will object to the House certification on January 6th.

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:54.740
And we need some of his colleagues to join him, don't we?

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:59.260
We expect them to join him, don't we?

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:02.860
Or we will throw them out of office.

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:03.860
Good luck.

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:04.860
Yeah.

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:05.940
But it doesn't stop there.

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:10.180
The threats against the Republicans who don't support Mo Brooks.

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.180
Threaten them.

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:16.940
Let me tell the Republican Party that if one of these senators do not join Mo Brooks, we

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:21.100
will burn the Republican Party down and we will make something new.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.100
Oh, no.

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.100
Yeah, you're so threatening.

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:34.820
I mean, look, I would say that that response is a little bit not good that we have.

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:39.860
And that is because, like, well, in 2009, some of the similar rhetoric was flying around

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:44.140
at early Tea Party rallies, and it would have been very easy to be like, yes, destroy the

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:45.140
Republican Party.

01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:53.180
But you see that when that effort happens, it's not like it cripples the party.

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:59.580
It ends up pushing extreme voices closer to the mainstream, or the mainstream goes towards

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:04.020
the crazy voices, as is more often the case, and we end up where we are now.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:09.080
So I don't think that they're going to be capable of doing this, but encouraging this

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:16.300
sort of inner GOP fighting, I don't know if it's great.

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:23.100
Because it does also lead to the possibility of people like Ali or Nick Fuentes or Alex

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:28.020
Jones coming into a more relevant position than they would be otherwise.

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:34.260
I think you're right, presupposing that we do nothing, which is what happened with the

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.300
Tea Party.

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:41.060
We all sat by and laughed as they fought and we were like, ha ha ha, let them fight, instead

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:48.700
of using this as an opportunity to sabotage both wings and fuck them up together.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:55.220
Like what we're doing is watching, like what they have done so successfully is constantly

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:58.940
push a wedge between the left and the center and the Democratic Party.

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:02.800
That's the best thing that the Republicans know how to do, is whenever there's the internecine

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:08.020
squabbles from the Democrats, the Republicans jump in and start throwing shit at the wall

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:12.740
too, to see if they can cause more conflagrations in between us.

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:16.380
And every time this happens on the right, the Democrats look back and they're like,

01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:20.260
well, I bet the reasonable head shall prevail this time.

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:21.260
And it's insane.

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:26.500
Yeah, yeah, that does seem to be, I don't know, it's tough because I do want to laugh

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.500
also.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:28.500
Yeah, me too, it's so funny.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:33.980
I'd like to find a way to use this as a politically useful moment, but also laugh.

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:39.980
Well, I mean, I think the thing that, like I feel for these idiots kind of in a way,

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:42.940
not the leaders, I mean the people at the rally.

01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:48.060
I feel for people's aunts and uncles and grandparents, like I feel for them.

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.060
Sure.

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.060
I don't feel for Ali.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.060
No, no, absolutely not.

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:56.300
No, I mean the people in the rally, because they are being told, don't feel for Ali, feel

01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.300
for the rally.

01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:58.300
Yes.

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:04.540
No, I mean the thing that I want to scream at all of these people is, look, if you want

01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:08.900
what they are telling you you want to get, then you have to start a shooting war.

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:10.460
Those are your options.

01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:13.060
None of this shit that they're selling you is real.

01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:14.420
They're wasting your time.

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:19.300
So if you really want to balls up, then start a shooting war or stop going to these dumb

01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:20.300
ass rallies.

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:24.540
The people who are taking the rhetoric that you are digesting seriously are beating up

01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.820
people on the streets.

01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:26.820
Exactly.

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:32.420
And that is the unfortunate reality of the rhetoric and what you are acclimating yourself

01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:33.420
to.

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:34.420
Exactly.

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:36.980
Yeah, that would be worthwhile for them to realize.

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:44.060
And the fruition of specifically what this type of rally is about, you get your goals,

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:47.120
you end up in a Christian theocracy.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:52.940
And I don't think that anybody, I don't think most people really actually want that.

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:53.940
No.

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:58.500
There's all those people who love Christianity and they're super religious, but then they

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:01.420
get into those situations where they have to apply it and they're like, well, maybe

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.860
not this time.

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:03.860
You know what?

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:07.220
I'm still a morally good person, but this time I'm not going to act in this way.

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:10.300
You know, tonight I'm going to go out and get drunk and I'm going to have a really good

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.300
night.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.840
And instead in a Christian theocracy, you're fucking killed for it.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.840
You know, like it's that kind of shit.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:20.420
Let's say you're a pastor and you marry, you know, you're already married and then you

01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:25.620
end up banging around with the secretary at your church and then, you know, I mean, under

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:30.980
a Christian theocracy, you will not do as well as you do under a liberal republic.

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:33.300
A little bit different.

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:37.060
You know how rich Christians still seem to get all the abortions that they want to get?

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.060
It is weird.

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.060
It is weird.

01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:44.140
So Ali Alexander, he thinks he's a mastermind.

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:49.660
And I got to say this next clip just sounds like he thinks he's a Bond villain and he's

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:53.540
coming out to this, this rally and like, here is our grand plan.

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:54.540
Oh boy.

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:55.540
So he's role playing it.

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:56.540
Yeah.

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:57.540
Yeah.

01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:58.540
It's, it's a little cringy.

01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:03.340
So the plan in January is to start organizing y'all.

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:07.740
We are going to go into the county parties, we are going to go into the district parties

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:11.340
and we are going to go to the state conventions of the Republican party and we're taking over

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:14.620
all 50 states.

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:16.820
We are going to work with the Jericho march.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:18.700
We are going to work with Alex Jones.

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:23.300
We are going to work with anyone who will work with us, aren't we?

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:27.260
And let me just tell you how deep this goes cause I've been in this business for 14 years

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.740
and finally the movement has a strategist.

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:35.540
I sat across and I'm not going to say his name, a state party chair and I said, Hey

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.180
buddy, we've known each other for 12 years.

01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:39.180
You're up for reelection in May.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.260
I'm going to flood your state convention.

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:45.260
And then after we take over all of the positions, we're then going to call a quorum and then

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:49.220
we're going to impeach the rest of the officers, aren't we?

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:52.660
I'm a dangerous black man who knows Robert's rules of order.

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:53.660
Wow.

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:59.060
So the Republican party, I just want them to hear this message.

01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:01.300
Look at this crowd.

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:07.280
We are the people that you must represent or we're going to replace you with Patriots.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.280
That's called voting.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:12.060
Yeah, I think he's basically, did he just discover voting?

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:14.140
I think he discovered community organizing.

01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:15.140
I think so.

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:20.240
The thing that they have decried the left doing hate it so much cause it's cheating.

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.180
Focusing on local politics.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:23.180
Yeah.

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:24.180
Yeah.

01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.180
Oh, scary.

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:27.180
Yeah.

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:30.300
See, this is why it's hard to take Alex's threat seriously.

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:33.620
Like we're going to kill Joe Biden immediately following.

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:41.180
Like what we're going to do is we're going to go, we're going to call a quorum for everyone.

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:42.300
What are we talking about?

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.180
I know Robert's rules of order.

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.180
What?

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:46.420
God damn it.

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:47.420
I bet he doesn't.

01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:52.620
I'm going to, I'm going to follow Patton into battle if he gives a speech like Robert's

01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:56.620
rules of order are dangerous in the wrong hands.

01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:59.620
Patton is actually on my mind quite a bit throughout this.

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:02.620
And I think it's probably because General Flynn, I watched him give the same speech

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:03.620
twice.

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:07.840
I just kept thinking like, this is not Patton.

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:08.940
This is bad.

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:09.940
That's what I keep hearing.

01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:13.340
When you hear nationalist propaganda, you want it to be Patton, right?

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:18.180
Well, I mean, that's what Alex is trying to be and a lot of these people are just absolutely

01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:19.180
whiffing.

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:20.180
Yeah, not good.

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:27.580
Granted, they're still bad and scary, but anyway, Ali ends his speech by talking a little

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.940
bit about how God is giving him science.

01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:32.660
This is upsetting.

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:35.840
The last thing I'll say, and I'll probably be back up on stage later, is that we have

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.740
God's favor.

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:41.180
One day I'm going to tell you guys all the stories, but this, the sun coming out like

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:44.380
this, this is God.

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.220
He has gone ahead of us.

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:51.660
I have been to 10 different states and it's not rained once.

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:52.660
Get the fuck out.

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:53.660
To God be the glory.

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:54.660
Get the fuck out.

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:55.660
No.

01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:56.660
No.

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:57.660
I've been to...

01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:58.660
God damn it.

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:04.580
Have you ever been to 10 states and it didn't rain once?

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:05.580
Can you say that?

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:06.580
I guess I can't.

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:07.580
Ha.

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.580
Or maybe I can.

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:09.580
I don't know.

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:10.580
Does flying count?

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:13.060
I flew over 10 states and it didn't rain once.

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:14.060
Does that count?

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.060
Were you above the rain?

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.620
What counts?

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:19.300
God damn it.

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:23.200
This is how I feel every time somebody tells me about ghosts.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.780
Every time somebody's like, oh, you don't believe in ghosts?

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:26.780
I've got a ghost story.

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:30.860
I'm like, tell me about how the sun shined for 10 states.

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:31.860
Fuck you.

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:32.860
It didn't rain.

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:33.860
God, it's a ghost.

01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:34.860
Didn't rain.

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:35.860
Didn't rain.

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:36.860
Oh, ghosts are real.

01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:37.860
Sure.

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:38.860
Didn't rain.

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:39.860
Yeah, okay.

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:42.260
I'm going to reverse Douglas Adams, rain god.

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:43.400
Get the fuck out of here.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:50.020
So after Ali gets done, they have another speaker and this is a guy by the name of Leon

01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:51.020
Benjamin.

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.020
Okay.

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:54.820
Who is a bishop, but I should also tell you that this year...

01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:55.820
A bishop of what?

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:56.820
Uh, at a church.

01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:57.820
Okay.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:01.300
This year, he also lost the race for the fourth district of Virginia seat in the house.

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:02.300
Oh, that's a bummer.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.300
House of Representatives.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.300
That's a bummer.

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:08.220
He also probably would have lost in the primary, like all the ding-dongs that we talk about

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:13.860
on this show, but he ran unopposed until the general election, and then he lost by quite

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:14.860
a margin.

01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:15.860
Quite a margin.

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:16.860
Quite a margin.

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:17.860
What are you saying?

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:18.860
What are you saying?

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:19.860
38 to 61, I think.

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:20.860
38 to 61?

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:22.260
That's not as big a margin as I would hope.

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:23.260
No.

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:24.260
It never is, is it, Dan?

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:25.260
But it's still pretty big.

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:27.300
Yeah, it is still pretty big, but it's never big enough.

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.300
Yeah.

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:37.300
So Eric Metaxas brings Bishop Leon Benjamin up, and man, I gotta say, I thought that maybe

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:41.180
this was a racist event, but man, this cleared it up.

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:49.340
I heard, I keep hearing that we're all racists, and yet every now and again, I bump into a

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:50.960
black man at these events.

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.580
What is happening?

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.320
What is happening?

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.320
Every now and again, is it?

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.320
That's not supposed to be the narrative.

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.320
What are you talking about?

01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:00.100
Aren't we supposed to be all about white nationalism?

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:03.260
I keep reading that, and you're screwing that up.

01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:06.820
This is Bishop Leon Benjamin.

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:13.300
He's got a shofar at the end of what he says he's gonna play the flight of the bumblebee.

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.300
Don't miss it.

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:15.300
Another bad joke.

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.300
Wow.

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:17.300
Yeah.

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:18.300
Well, they're not racist.

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:19.300
That's cool.

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:20.300
Anyway, Leon-

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:21.900
Did he just make a minstrel joke while saying he wasn't being racist?

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.980
It might be on the cusp, I'm not entirely sure.

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:30.500
So Leon is really into Christian nationalism.

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:32.540
There are walls that must come down.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:33.540
This is history.

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:37.280
This is December 12th, 12th, the number for government.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.660
That means a fresh anointing is about to come on this nation-

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:41.660
That was the number for government?

01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:47.780
An anointing that we have never felt before, an anointing we have never seen before.

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:57.180
Jesus is the lion of the tribe of Judah, and he will rule in America.

01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:58.180
Man.

01:12:58.180 --> 01:12:59.180
Man.

01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:00.180
Yeah.

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:06.580
And the Nationalists just really miss out on a lot of great black preachers, you know?

01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:08.620
So it's nice that they get this one, but-

01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:11.260
Well, that's the advantage of Christian nationalism.

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:12.260
I guess.

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:17.780
Yeah, you still get a few good talkers here and there.

01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:23.940
So Jordan, I know that we've heard a lot about wee-etches over the course of the time of

01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:24.940
doing this show.

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:25.940
They're fucking everywhere.

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:26.940
It's true.

01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:31.540
They've not really gotten any good advice about what to do about them, or like-

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.540
That's true.

01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:33.540
How do you talk to a wee-etch?

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:35.380
How do you deal with wee-etches?

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:39.480
This is what I learned about witchcraft.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:43.380
You gotta tell a witch, you gotta look them right in the eye and say, I'm coming after

01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:44.380
you.

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:45.620
This is your last day.

01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:47.340
This is your last time.

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:52.380
Every curse you cursed against our president and against our nation is gonna double fold

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.220
back on your head.

01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:57.580
You have to be direct with witches, you understand?

01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:58.580
That's the advice.

01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:06.780
I just, I just, I'm just, all I'm thinking is Wizard of Oz, Dorothy wakes up, Glenda

01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:10.900
the Good Witch shows up and she's just like, you get the fuck out of my face!

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:12.700
I will come and kill you!

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:17.220
You listen to me, I'm going back to Kansas.

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.220
That's how you deal with wee-etches.

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.340
That's how you deal with witches.

01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:25.740
So Leon scares the hell out of me, quite frankly, because he says stuff like this.

01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:32.140
But when you shout, just understand, you're shouting for not only this generation, but

01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:35.780
you're shouting a legacy for the next generation.

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:41.260
Because the demons we kill now, our children will not have to fight these devils!

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:44.900
These are our devils, and we will kill them now!

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:48.580
They will not fight our children!

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:49.580
Just...

01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:50.580
Man!

01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:56.020
I understand that there's some, like, rhetorical license that you're not maybe intending to

01:14:56.020 --> 01:15:02.620
talk about killing humans and your political enemies, but you're at a political rally,

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:07.180
and you're talking about these demons and these devils that we're up against, and the

01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:12.540
conversation very easily, it could be understood as people who wear black and are, like, you

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:14.100
think they're an antifa?

01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:16.460
Maybe someone at a Black Lives Matter rally?

01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:19.380
Maybe these are the demons that you don't want your children to have to fight.

01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:22.380
Everyone you get rid of is one your children doesn't have to fight.

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:28.220
Right, I don't think that, you know, you could make a legally reasonable case that this is

01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:33.980
somebody threatening or inciting people to kill other people, but it's reckless.

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:38.580
It's recklessly expressed ideas, and I can't...

01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:45.380
That's a great speech if it's 1977 and you're talking about climate change.

01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:50.860
Every bit of greenhouse gas that we get rid of is one that our kids don't have to deal

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:51.860
with.

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:52.860
Exactly.

01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:53.860
If you kind of put it that way...

01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:54.860
Then it makes great sense.

01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:56.100
It's a good thing to do, in fact.

01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:57.100
Somewhat.

01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:58.100
Yeah.

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:06.100
So Alex Jones gave his speech, and then a little video came out of him backstage as

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.780
he ran into General Flynn.

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:09.900
And this is really, really funny.

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:10.900
I had some words.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:14.700
I recommend people go find this video, since we're an audio podcast, I'll play the audio

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.620
and then I'll explain what happened.

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:19.180
Crazy day, huh?

01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:21.180
It isn't crazy.

01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:23.180
Are you scared?

01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:25.180
We're gonna win.

01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:26.180
What?

01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:29.180
You don't want me to get scared?

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:31.260
You guys are funny, man.

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:34.580
General Flynn did not want to talk to Alex at all.

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:35.700
I don't know why!

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:40.140
Alex comes up and he's like, crazy day, and General Flynn does not turn to him.

01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:43.460
He kind of like turns his head, but not his body, and he's like, yeah, it is a crazy day.

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:45.780
He's like, ah, we're gonna win.

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.780
And then he's like, are you scared?

01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:48.780
You scared?

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:49.780
And Flynn's like, what?

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:52.460
He's like, are you scared to shake my hand?

01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:58.340
And then Alex kind of gets this like, someone else kind of walks up and Alex gets the sense

01:16:58.340 --> 01:16:59.340
of like, I gotta leave.

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:00.340
Oh, wow.

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:01.340
And so he walks off.

01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:06.980
And the camera pans over and Owen Troyer's standing a ways back.

01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:10.780
So there's the reveal of Owen Troyer, just in the corner watching?

01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:14.460
Yeah, like keeping his distance because he knows like, oh, this isn't gonna go well.

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:15.460
This isn't for me.

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:16.980
I'm not supposed to be there.

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:21.220
And then Alex tries to save face with like, ah, you guys are funny.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:26.580
No, Flynn either knows who you are and doesn't want to be associated with you or has no idea

01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.580
who you are.

01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:28.580
Oh, man.

01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:30.180
Either way, it does not work well for his brand.

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:35.340
Yeah, you should not meet your heroes that you created fictional versions of, assuming

01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:37.500
that the fictional version will greet you warmly.

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.500
Yeah.

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:39.500
Yeah, it's an issue.

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:47.620
So Flynn, he gives a speech, gets up at this Jericho rally, and man, what a fucking beginning

01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:48.620
to this speech.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:49.620
Just awe-inspiring.

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:57.180
You know, I was gonna end with a prayer, but maybe we'll start with a prayer.

01:17:57.180 --> 01:17:58.460
This sounds planned.

01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:03.500
I told Mike Lindell as he was walking and we bumped into each other, I actually had

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:06.540
the first good sleep of my life last night.

01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:12.340
So mypillow.com, I'll give him a commercial.

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:16.260
Mike fucking Flynn starts a speech with a plug for MyPillow.

01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:19.260
Oh my God.

01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:23.420
He must be throwing around cash at MyPillow guy.

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:29.940
On this, our safe Christmas day, I must remind you, we happy few.

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:33.260
How much fucking money is that guy making?

01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:35.860
There is a 5% discount.

01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:36.860
Did he find...

01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:39.660
On straw beds when we return home heroes!

01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:46.420
Did he find like a cache of Krugerands or something, like he find pirate gold?

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:49.620
How is he throwing around all this money at a pillow company?

01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:52.780
I don't know, but Flynn's got that pillow cache.

01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:53.780
God.

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:58.460
Anyway, so I know in Dune, I know people love Dune Talk, right?

01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:00.220
People love Dune Talk.

01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.900
They love it.

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:04.740
Fear is the mind killer.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:05.740
Fear is the mind killer.

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:06.740
Is that correct?

01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:07.740
That is correct.

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:08.740
You tell me a little bit about this.

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:09.740
Fear is the mind killer.

01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:13.220
It is the little death that, man, now that I'm on the...

01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:14.660
No, the petite moor is an orgasm.

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:15.920
No, no, no.

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.920
Fear is the...

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.980
No, it's part of the litany against fear, Dan.

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:19.980
Oh.

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:21.980
It's something that the Bene Gesserit teach you to say whenever you're afraid.

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:23.980
Does this have anything to do with Muad'Dib?

01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:28.020
Muad'Dib did learn the litany against fear and used it many a time in order to calm himself

01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:29.700
and bring himself into a more stable state.

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:32.260
How does this relate to Duncan, Idaho?

01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:34.720
Duncan, Idaho learned the litany against fear.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:40.500
His mother was a Bene Gesserit, and so he was aware of all of that stuff.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:43.740
However, he was never trained in the ways of the Bene Gesserit because men children

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:44.740
were not allowed.

01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:49.700
Only the Kwisatz Haderach, Dan.

01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:51.900
And were sandworms Bene Gesserits?

01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:52.900
Yes.

01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:55.020
Sandworms are not Bene Gesserits.

01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:57.740
They were actually God himself, Shai-Hulud.

01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:59.060
Fear is the mind killer.

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.060
Fear is the mind killer.

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.740
Sandworm, body killer.

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:04.020
Sandworms kill everybody, but they are also God.

01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:06.660
They are also the devil, Shaitan.

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:12.820
I wanted to discuss this a little bit because as Mike Flynn was talking, I was like, are

01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:14.200
you going to get into fear?

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.200
He's talking about fear.

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:18.180
I was like, oh, is he going to say that fear is the mind killer?

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.180
He's very close.

01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:20.180
This is very close.

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:21.180
I want him to do it.

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:29.060
In our minds, in our minds, that's where we find fear because fear is a mental thing.

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:33.740
It's something that you have in your minds and you fear things because your mind says,

01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:36.220
I'm afraid of that or I'm afraid of this.

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:38.040
But it's in our hearts.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:42.900
It's in our hearts where we truly know what is right.

01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:48.900
Because in our hearts, that's where we differentiate between good and bad, right?

01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:53.060
Where we differentiate between darkness and light.

01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:54.060
And we know that.

01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:55.380
We know that in our heart.

01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:58.400
It's that gut feeling, but it's actually your heart.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.080
It's your heart talking to you.

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:04.020
Not in your mind because your mind is going to say, I'm afraid.

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:05.740
So fear is the mind killer.

01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:09.780
Trust your gut because your weird feelings are actually your heart, which is clearer

01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:11.540
because your heart is free of fear.

01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:18.540
The only thing we have to fear is fear because it comes from inside you, but it's also part

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:22.260
of your heart and you can't listen to it, but it's not part of your heart because it's

01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:24.560
what you're afraid of and it's in your head.

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:28.060
And fear is what we fear the most itself.

01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:29.060
Yeah.

01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:31.500
And it's a pattern.

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.500
Yeah.

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:35.380
A lot of great speakers in history.

01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.380
Not one of them.

01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:37.380
No.

01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:42.820
I realized as he was speaking that I don't think I've ever heard a full speech of his.

01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:43.820
Me neither.

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:44.980
And I found it underwhelming.

01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:47.860
I found that to be incredibly terrible.

01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:50.860
So one thing I'm afraid of is helicopters.

01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:53.020
That's not actually true, but it's a good segue.

01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:54.020
Nice.

01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:55.660
One thing I'm afraid of is Segues.

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:57.500
Well, we're both terrified.

01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:00.140
While Flynn is on stage, that's when the flyover happens.

01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:00.780
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:04.300
And this is just depressing.

01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:06.420
Imagine being able to just jump in a helicopter

01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:08.420
and go for a joy ride around Washington, DC.

01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:08.900
I love it.

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:11.060
I love the fact that he does that.

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:14.620
That's what he does, because he knows

01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:17.500
that the people that he can trust

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:20.460
are people that he's never met.

01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:21.400
And that's you.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.660
I mean, he's never met.

01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:26.700
Look at the millions and millions of people, right?

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:27.580
He trusts you.

01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:31.500
He trusts you because he knows you know what's going on,

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:33.180
and you will not allow what's happening

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:34.300
to happen in our country.

01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:35.440
None of us will.

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:36.640
It's just not going to happen.

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:39.240
I will tell you one more time, because I've been asked,

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:41.940
on a scale of 1 to 10, who will be the next president

01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:47.460
of the United States, and I say Donald Trump, 10, a 10.

01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:50.820
You know, that moment there where he's like, first of all,

01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:53.660
the idea that Trump can trust you people who he doesn't know

01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:54.500
is very sad.

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:55.460
So sad.

01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:58.340
But when Flynn is like, he trusts you because you're

01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.740
the ones who know what's going on,

01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.980
you're not going to allow what's happening to happen,

01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:04.260
makes me think of that Andy Daly character, who's

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:07.500
like the stand-up comic who says nothing.

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:08.740
Like, what else is in the news?

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:09.540
Can you believe this?

01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:10.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:11.420
Another?

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:12.940
I mean, come on.

01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:14.500
What is going on with one of these?

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.300
What's with this?

01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:16.300
Come on.

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:18.340
I mean, not when I was.

01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:20.460
Not if I have anything to say about it.

01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:23.420
When this goes down, oh boy.

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:24.380
Yeah.

01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:27.180
Trump trusts you because you know what's going on

01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:29.300
and you're not going to let what happens happen.

01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:29.780
Wow.

01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:32.860
Just fucking say that you wanted everyone

01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:36.540
to incite an installing of an unelected president.

01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:39.300
It just punctures so much of that.

01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:43.620
Like, it is one of those things that you don't really,

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:45.620
it doesn't always hit you until it does.

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.260
Like, how much you've been fucked up

01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:50.140
by movies and TV and culture and all that shit.

01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:55.460
Because you just hear General and you

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:59.580
like see his military record and all of these war,

01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:00.540
like all of this shit.

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.580
And he rose to this high rank and you're like,

01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:04.460
that's the fucking guy?

01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:08.420
Yeah, you kind of think of no-nonsense, stern sort

01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:13.140
of men-a-few-words, stiff upper lip kind of, yeah.

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:15.420
And that's not the vibe Flynn gives.

01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:17.740
Actually, he's the brown-nosing toady

01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:21.660
who politicked his way up into the military, high ranks.

01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:22.620
He's a fucking dick.

01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:24.620
There's another guy who's like from Vets

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:27.500
for Trump who gives a speech that is fairly uneventful

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:28.860
and I don't have any clips of it.

01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:31.180
But he was far more like what you're talking about,

01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:32.060
what you would expect.

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:34.500
Like a guy who's like, oh, you're terrified.

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:36.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're dark.

01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:37.220
You're dark.

01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:38.220
Yeah, you're a dark man.

01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:39.740
You seem like an archetype of someone

01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:42.740
who's seen some shit.

01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:47.700
So this, I got to say, the Jericho rally drags at this point.

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:48.300
I believe it.

01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:49.500
And I'm done with it.

01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:51.300
We're not going to talk about any more of it

01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:53.620
because it just ends up deteriorating into a thing

01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:56.060
where like there's a guy from Bikers for Trump

01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:59.620
and he ends up talking about how they formed this group, right?

01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:02.020
They formed this group because they wanted to stop Antifa

01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:04.860
from throwing dog poop at Trump supporters who are waiting

01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:05.980
in line to get into events.

01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:07.980
You said that in front of people.

01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:10.060
Yeah, he said that in an interview on the TV.

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:10.660
Wow.

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:12.820
There's also some more religious weirdos.

01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:16.980
And you know, I just, I lost it.

01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:17.980
I couldn't.

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:20.380
I mean, there was also a couple other Infowars characters,

01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:22.620
but they were like kind of really adjacent people.

01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:25.100
Like Jason Jones, the guy who hosts The Fourth Hour

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:29.540
sometimes, like he was there and he gave an interview.

01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:32.300
It was just kind of like, this is too much.

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:36.100
And again, I think the problem is that Alex was kind of early.

01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:36.620
Yeah.

01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:39.220
It really took so much steam out of him.

01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:41.660
None of these other people could reach the heights of that.

01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:45.140
Like, you know, I don't know of any actual comedian who

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:48.460
talks about laughs per minute, but I've heard the idea

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:49.340
discussed.

01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:53.140
And applause lines per minute, Alex just wrecked shop.

01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:56.140
Like no one is going to be able to recover from that.

01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:57.060
He scorched earth it.

01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:58.100
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:58.100 --> 01:25:59.980
And so I.

01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:02.300
Which I imagine he did on purpose, honestly.

01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:02.700
Yeah.

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:05.300
Because I've been under, I've been

01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:08.380
put where I wasn't supposed to go in the lineup before.

01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:11.660
And I made it very clear I wasn't supposed to go there.

01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:12.140
Yeah.

01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:12.500
You know?

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:12.980
Yeah.

01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:14.940
I'm going to bury whoever comes up next.

01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:17.100
I'm going to bury your headliners so far

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:17.900
into the ground.

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:18.860
It's going to be brutal.

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:21.780
It's also notable that Alex and Mike Flynn

01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:24.700
both come out to the Mission Impossible theme.

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:28.300
Like Alex might have stolen Mike Flynn's intro music.

01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:31.100
Now that's some petty shit that I'm here for.

01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:31.620
Yes.

01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:33.340
I am here for that pettiness all day.

01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:36.140
I think there might be something there.

01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:40.940
So I watched a bunch more of this.

01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:42.820
But I lost my patience for it.

01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:45.500
Because I mean like how much, what else are we going to find?

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:48.260
More examples of people saying the exact same Christian

01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:49.540
nationalist shit?

01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:50.060
Who cares?

01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:51.620
God, kill everybody.

01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:52.180
We got it.

01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:52.740
Moving on.

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:55.700
But there was another rally that day.

01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:59.300
And this was the Women for America First rally.

01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:02.740
This was being held pretty close nearby around the same time.

01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:04.780
There's some particularly fun footage also

01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:06.540
that's going around on Twitter, which

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:10.140
is of Alex trying to bum rush the stage at the Women

01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:11.060
for Trump rally.

01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:14.780
That sounds like a metaphor I'm able to understand clearly.

01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:15.940
Very unsuccessful.

01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:35.740
Maybe I just got a little enthusiastic, but we're going to do it, because Trump won't stop coming.

01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:42.740
We're not allowed to be here, we're not allowed to be here.

01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:51.420
Yes, yes, that is how you get escorted out.

01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:19.080
This is a family show, Alex.

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:24.360
My first thought when I watched that was that Alex seems like he's on stimulants.

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.580
He seems amped the fuck up.

01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:27.580
Red eyes.

01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:32.340
Yeah, and like grinding his mouth and like ready to fight with a security guard who won't

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:33.340
let him through.

01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:34.340
Yeah.

01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:38.520
Feels like he clearly thinks he's entitled to get up there and get on stage at an event

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:42.360
where the security guard is like, you're not welcome here.

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:47.760
But I think about it and I'm like, well, honestly, he probably is coming over there right after

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.300
he yelled at the other crowd.

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.140
I would assume he was, he thought he was welcome.

01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:54.220
He's probably jacked as fuck off the adrenaline of that.

01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:55.220
Totally.

01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:56.220
Maybe also some stimulants, who knows.

01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:57.220
Yeah, why not?

01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:58.220
He's an older man.

01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:04.060
Yeah, so there, he got shut down from going to the Women for America First rally and you

01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:09.420
can tell that that's that rally because you can hear the guy in the background talking

01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:14.780
about the March for Trump, which was the bus tour that led to and culminated with this

01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:18.100
Women for Trump America First rally.

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:21.540
I didn't hear him whining about flags either, so I assumed it was a...

01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:22.540
Wait for it.

01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:23.980
Oh no!

01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:31.020
So this rally was a much, it's much less relevant to our focus since there's less direct Infowars

01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:32.020
connections.

01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:36.740
Alex wasn't allowed at this one, he was allowed at the other show and they even let Owen Schroyer

01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:37.740
on stage.

01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:38.740
Yeah, that's weird.

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:41.980
Alexander was one of the organizers of the Jericho rally and like I said, there were

01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:45.720
a couple other Infowars people that you could find hanging around.

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:49.340
In contrast, this Women for America First rally felt like people who were a bit more

01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:51.700
interested in being taken seriously.

01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:56.100
The thing that I take issue with is that I can only find two real differences between

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:57.100
them.

01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:01.580
One is that Alex was not allowed at the Women for America First one and they also seem to

01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:06.220
mention political issues a little more than the Jericho one.

01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:10.460
That was pretty solidly focused on demanding Christian nationalism, whereas this one is

01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:13.720
hiding a little bit in conservative politics.

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:17.460
Big difference between the middle and far right wings of the Republican party.

01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:22.860
And desperately trying to appear somewhat credible with their booking choices.

01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:26.380
So they have like Katrina Pearson and Seb Gorka.

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:28.260
Yes, very credible.

01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:29.260
Well, comparatively.

01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:31.140
Yeah, well I mean I guess.

01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:33.020
I guess they're bigger names maybe?

01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:36.940
Like Sebastian Gorka has a show that's syndicated.

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:37.940
Okay that's fair.

01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:40.020
Alex is on Genesis Communications.

01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:43.600
Still amazing to me that Seb Gorka is just allowed to roam free.

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:44.600
It is.

01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:48.420
And, shockingly, I texted you about this last night while I was.

01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:50.740
I texted you that he seems like a character.

01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:52.940
Like a sketch character.

01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:56.860
Like I had not also heard much Sebastian Gorka.

01:30:56.860 --> 01:31:01.980
Except for maybe like little clips or honestly a Domian doing an impression of him.

01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:02.980
Yeah.

01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:03.980
But you've played for me.

01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:04.980
Way less.

01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:09.780
I honestly felt like watching that, I was like Sebastian Gorka's leaning into the bit.

01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:16.180
It felt like he was becoming the parodies of himself.

01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:17.180
That sounds right.

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:22.900
Or maybe the parodies are just that good that like they really nail it because he seems

01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:24.700
like a farce of a person.

01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:25.700
Yeah.

01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:33.380
Like whenever your front lines are run by a hair dye bleeding Rudy Giuliani in front

01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:34.900
of a landscaping company.

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:35.900
Hey man.

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:39.260
Your parodies are gonna be just straight impressions.

01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:41.500
Rudy's the guy who hits the barbed wire.

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:48.140
So Jordan, I originally intended that we would cover the entire rally of the Women for America

01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:49.140
first.

01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:50.140
Sure.

01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:51.140
Just like the Jericho one.

01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:52.140
Yeah.

01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:54.660
But the more I thought about it, the less that seemed compatible with my goal of creating

01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:56.700
a decent show that people can enjoy.

01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:59.500
Yeah, we could have just done rallies that were terrible.

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:04.420
Mike Flynn and the My Pillow guy basically give the exact same speeches at both rallies

01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:09.060
and the whole thing just drags on way too long much like the other one with people just

01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:10.300
basically saying nothing.

01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:11.300
Yeah.

01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:12.820
Like it's really, it's really vapid.

01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:14.740
Well it has to be.

01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:15.740
Yeah.

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:16.740
They have no actual substance.

01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:20.580
It's mostly getting people to chant about loving Trump and you know, whatever.

01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:23.340
Yeah, it's fucking straight up Nazi shit.

01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:28.500
I decided that possibly a better way to approach the Women for America First rally was to hand

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:30.460
out some awards, some superlatives.

01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:31.460
Okay.

01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:35.660
As if this lineup was a bunch of matriculating, graduating seniors in high school.

01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:36.660
Love it.

01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:40.220
So the first, the first title I'd like to bestow on someone is...

01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:41.700
Most likely to secede?

01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:42.700
No.

01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:43.700
Hey.

01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:44.700
Not bad.

01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:45.700
Not bad.

01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:46.700
All of them.

01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:47.700
All right.

01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:48.700
Most confusing breath of fresh air.

01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:49.700
Okay.

01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:50.700
What's up DC?

01:32:50.700 --> 01:33:00.940
How was General Flynn you guys, was that amazing or what?

01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:09.460
That man and his family have laid it on the line for our country over and over and over

01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:13.380
again and we can't show them enough gratitude.

01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:15.540
This guy is very clearly drunk.

01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:16.540
Yeah.

01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:21.620
He used to be in his late 30s, early 40s and is wearing what appears to be a red sequined

01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:22.620
smoking jacket.

01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:24.100
All right, now I like him.

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:25.220
Now I'm back on board.

01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:26.260
He's got a beard.

01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:31.940
He seems fucking day drunk at like noon or one.

01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:33.780
There but for the grace of God go I, Dan.

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:39.500
He is absolutely out of place at this rally and as the kids say, I was here for it.

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:42.340
Also, I have no idea who he is.

01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:43.340
He never says his name.

01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:44.340
Yes.

01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:45.340
No one says his name.

01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:46.340
Yes.

01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:47.340
I don't know who he is.

01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:48.780
I tried to find out.

01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:49.780
I could not find out.

01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:51.860
I looked at the comments of the YouTube video.

01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:54.180
I Googled lineup of event.

01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:55.180
I couldn't find it.

01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:58.940
He was standing next to Alex when the security guard stopped him and he was like, I'm going

01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:00.580
to go all through then.

01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:05.320
But unfortunately, like all things we discuss on this show that are kind of fun, he ended

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:09.780
up revealing himself to be a piece of shit, but also in the same clip that he says something

01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:12.140
that I was really tickled by.

01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:14.620
There's three parts to my message.

01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:19.220
I'm alarmed I lost all my guns, a tragic boating accident.

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:20.220
What?

01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:21.220
What just happened?

01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:22.220
You guys have been.

01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:24.820
What did you just say to me?

01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:25.820
Second part.

01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:26.820
No, you stop about that.

01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:30.220
I want to know the first part of the ability.

01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:32.860
Something that we have to deal a lot with with the Kung flu.

01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:34.860
Oh, come on.

01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:35.860
Damn it, man.

01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:36.860
Disappointing.

01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:38.020
Oh, we were doing so good.

01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:39.940
We even got tragic boating accident.

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:41.060
I wasn't expecting that.

01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:43.580
I'm not sure if that is a joke.

01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:48.340
Or if he actually had a boating accident and lost his guns.

01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:50.100
Why would you say tragic boating accident?

01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:51.260
That seems specific.

01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:57.020
It's either pretty funny as a joke, like I don't have any guns, I lost them in a tragic

01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:58.020
boating accident.

01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.140
See, now that's something that I would toss off if I was emceeing somewhere.

01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:02.540
I'd just be like, ah, I lost them in a tragic boating accident.

01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:03.540
Everybody moves on.

01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:05.060
Yeah, not a bad throwaway line.

01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:06.500
Yeah, a little toss.

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:08.540
Also could be real, and I want to know the story.

01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:09.540
It could be real.

01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:14.700
Why was he specifically just telling me that he lost all of his guns in a tragic boating

01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:15.700
accident?

01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:17.460
Either way, I find him to be an engaging presence.

01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:23.380
He's got this weird red sequence-smoking jacket and he's fucked up.

01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:26.280
Why did you have to say that fucking racist flu stuff?

01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:33.780
It's a little bit like a racist right-winger played by Kyle Kinane, you know?

01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:36.140
I had no idea what is going on.

01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:37.380
I don't know who he is.

01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:39.460
He doesn't introduce himself.

01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:40.740
No one says.

01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:43.740
He's on the TV stream of it.

01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:45.640
There's no name on the chyron.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:46.640
No idea.

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:47.640
He might have just shown up.

01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:48.820
He might have just wandered on there.

01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:49.820
I have no idea.

01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:55.260
But while he's on stage, he introduces a person who has the same name as a big celebrity,

01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:57.600
but does not appear to be that celebrity.

01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:03.900
You will never stand for it, and we're going to keep coming back until it's known, and

01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:10.180
our president, the greatest president ever, is where he's supposed to be.

01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:12.740
I fucking love this guy.

01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:13.740
He's great.

01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:16.140
I made sure this was an amazing woman.

01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:18.020
I told her I'd keep it brief.

01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:19.700
I don't want to get in trouble.

01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:24.980
So Jennifer Lawrence, come up and talk to everybody.

01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:28.860
It is not Jennifer Lawrence.

01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:31.660
I don't know who this Jennifer Lawrence is either.

01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:36.340
I thought maybe if I figured out who she is, it would help me find out who he is, and it

01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:37.340
did not.

01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:38.820
I still have no idea who anybody is.

01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:43.340
Is this like when that couple crashed a White House party and everybody was like, holy shit,

01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:44.340
how did they get in there?

01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:46.660
If it is, I love it.

01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:49.780
So Jennifer Lawrence is unfortunately a Christian nationalist.

01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:50.780
Well, that sounds-

01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:55.740
Those people on that hill over there need to remember that they work for us.

01:36:55.740 --> 01:37:00.260
We the people, we don't work for them.

01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:04.500
We answer to God, not government, and God is going to tell us who's going to be the

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:09.060
president, and God is going to tell us how this country is going to go, and we are going

01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:10.060
to fight.

01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:11.060
Okay.

01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:12.060
Thank you, Jennifer Lawrence.

01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:19.460
So then even if you get your president, you're still not going to do what the government

01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:20.460
says?

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:21.460
I guess not.

01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:25.340
Anyway, congratulations to clearly day drunk guy in a sequined smoking jacket.

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:30.460
You have won the very coveted title of most confusing breath of fresh air at that rally.

01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:37.020
I was a little bit hoping that somebody out of... What if JB Smoove did five minutes?

01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:41.060
That's what I was hoping the super surprising confusing breath of fresh air was.

01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:44.520
No, it's day drunk guy in a sequined red coat.

01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:45.980
Pretty close to JB Smoove.

01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:46.980
Yeah.

01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:50.860
So the next award that I'm going to give out, the next superlative, is the best integration

01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:53.740
of promotional messaging into a stump speech.

01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:55.380
My pillow, my pillow.

01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:56.380
Nope.

01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:57.380
Oh.

01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:58.380
Well, my pillow might be involved.

01:37:58.380 --> 01:37:59.380
Okay.

01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:06.180
But this award goes to radio show host David J. Harris, and let me say, it's not even close.

01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:07.180
Okay.

01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:08.180
All right.

01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:09.180
He ran away with this thing.

01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:10.180
Okay.

01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:15.220
And a special thank you to the co-sponsor that really helped fund a lot of this, Mr.

01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:21.940
My Pillow himself, Mike Lindell.

01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:27.260
Amazing patriot, loves this country, loves us, loves the president, and the president

01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:28.260
loves him.

01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:30.540
And I got to tell you, I love his codes, right?

01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:36.460
I love his pillows, I love his sheets, I love his mattress topper, and I love his codes

01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:37.460
because you know what?

01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:38.460
The Kraken has been released.

01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:42.620
You are part of the Kraken.

01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:48.900
So for the best deals to support this patriot, use the code Kraken at mypillow.com.

01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:50.020
Amazing.

01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:51.020
Just amazing.

01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:52.020
Just amazing.

01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:53.020
Just amazing.

01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:57.400
I can't say enough how not smooth that was.

01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.020
That is really, really bad.

01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:02.740
But David doesn't just stop with my pillow codes.

01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:06.380
He also throws out like, hey, I'm big on social media.

01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:15.020
I've worked hard over the last few years to try to bring you real honest news at davidharrisjr.com.

01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:19.540
I've got 2.3 million followers on Facebook, 1.1 on Instagram.

01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:24.860
You can plug in his website, his social media, and that's great, but that is all just in

01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:31.220
order to prepare you for another plug, which is the solution to Facebook.

01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:32.220
Oh, okay.

01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:33.220
I hear people talking about Parler.

01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:34.220
Parler's amazing.

01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:38.980
It's a great alternative to Twitter, but we need an alternative to Facebook.

01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:43.300
Something that works and operates like Facebook, and I've found it, I'm going to be talking

01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:44.300
about it loud.

01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:47.320
I've got a lot of my friends are going to be talking about it loud.

01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:54.020
It's called Spreely, stands for Speak Freely, and here's where you can download it, S-P-R-E-E-L-Y.

01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:58.620
Spreely, you're going to hear a lot about that, and they're going to dominate Facebook.

01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:03.780
I'm going to guess they're not, but all of these people, like a lot of them seem to be

01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:06.680
pushing internet startups.

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:10.580
Like there was that Ian Rakelin guy who came to Alex's CPAC thing, and he was trying to

01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:11.900
push a search engine.

01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:18.780
I think that they're really trying to make a little bit of a fast cash on the conservative

01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:22.540
agreement over social media market.

01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:27.260
This is what I'm saying when I say I feel for these idiots in the crowd here.

01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:33.220
You guys are being sold the idea that you can legally just get whatever you want, so

01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:39.580
long as they'll fire lawsuits and then we'll get whatever we want, because we're right.

01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:45.260
They're selling you all of this like, and when this happens, which we totally know it's

01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:50.260
going to, it will keep us from having to do the one thing that we know is the only way

01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:54.460
to get what we want to achieve and we're trying to avoid, and it's like you're just being

01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:58.760
taken along by these guys who are selling you on Spreely.

01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.460
No one's going to go on Spreely.

01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:01.460
No!

01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:02.460
Yeah.

01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:11.440
He also has perfected this technique that David Harris has of protected prayer, he does

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:15.580
the Lord's Prayer, but he wants to really take every line of it and think about what

01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:16.580
does it mean.

01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:17.580
Oh no.

01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:18.580
Yeah.

01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:19.580
Are we going to get a commentary?

01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:20.580
No, we're not going to listen to all of it.

01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:21.580
We're not going to get an abridged version?

01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:22.580
It's so long.

01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:23.580
It's like six minutes.

01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:24.580
Jesus!

01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:25.580
Yeah.

01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:29.300
But this is the end of it and how smoothly it transitions into a plug.

01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:30.300
Oh wow.

01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:39.020
Give us a greater understanding, Father, of your love for us as the individual son, as

01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:40.660
an individual daughter.

01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:47.060
Give us a greater revelation, Father, of your love for us and let us be that catalyst and

01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:49.780
that change in our country.

01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:53.540
In Jesus' name, amen?

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:54.860
Amen!

01:41:54.860 --> 01:42:00.340
I truly believe we're going to win.

01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:03.420
I truly believe the fraud is going to be exposed.

01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:05.720
The Kraken has been released.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:12.060
We the people will not be denied seeing another four years of the amazing presidency of Donald

01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:13.060
J. Trump.

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:14.060
God bless you.

01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:22.020
I think we're going to hear this and still 45.

01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:25.140
We're going to hear that again.

01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:28.620
So please visit davidharrisjr.com.

01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:32.260
Help me fight these suckers that are just constantly on me.

01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:34.740
Gotta fight these suckers that are on me.

01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:35.740
Wow.

01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:36.740
Wow.

01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:37.740
Quite a ride.

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:44.180
And Jesus overturned those money changers tables and said, follow me at at jesus underscore

01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:45.180
magic.

01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:46.180
Help me fight these suckers?

01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:47.180
Yeah.

01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:56.260
Yeah, I found his speech to be laden with a promotion to a point where it was distracting.

01:42:56.260 --> 01:42:57.260
It was a little distracting.

01:42:57.260 --> 01:43:00.180
Granted, I have no idea who this guy is.

01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:03.220
So I can't judge his body of work.

01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:07.300
I can only watch this and say it was a little much.

01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:08.300
Yikes.

01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:15.220
So Jordan, our next category is the most graceful exit from someone who clearly did not want

01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:17.300
to be there.

01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:19.980
This award goes to someone we know, actually.

01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:22.100
He's a guy who promoted pizza gate quite heavily.

01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:23.100
Oh no.

01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:24.100
Jack.

01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:25.100
Oh, God damn it.

01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:27.740
They said that I could have longer time up here today, but I said, I want to give my

01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:28.820
time up.

01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:38.020
I want to give my time up to a whistleblower, a courageous whistleblower who saw something

01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:41.580
and decided to say something and stand up.

01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:46.740
So ladies and gentlemen, all the way from Michigan, Melissa Carone, who's going to come

01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:49.820
up and tell you what she saw.

01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:56.060
So that's the lady who appeared to be drunk with Rudy Giuliani in that video that everyone

01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:57.060
loved so much.

01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:58.060
Yeah, there it is.

01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:01.340
Yeah, so Jack clearly, I got the vibe that he was, because that's like a minute into

01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:02.340
his being married.

01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:03.340
Yeah, that's great.

01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:04.340
He's just like, I'm out of here.

01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:05.340
That's great.

01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:06.340
That is good stuff.

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:09.180
They would have given Melissa Carone a speaking spot if she'd asked.

01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:10.180
Totally.

01:44:10.180 --> 01:44:12.140
And I was like, yeah, I don't really want to do this.

01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:13.140
I don't want to do it.

01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:14.140
No.

01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:15.140
But I do want my name there.

01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:16.500
Yeah, just in case.

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:17.500
I would like my attention.

01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:18.500
Yes.

01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:19.980
But I do not want to do the work for it.

01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:20.980
Thank you.

01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:21.980
Yeah.

01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:23.620
So congratulations, Jack.

01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:24.620
You made a graceful exit.

01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:25.620
That's well done.

01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:26.620
Yeah, that's well done.

01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:28.740
There's a, oh, there's a late entry.

01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:29.740
What's that?

01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:31.820
There's actually an escalation of this category.

01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:32.820
Oh no.

01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:36.900
Now we have to give out the award for the person who made the most graceful, I'm not

01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:39.140
even showing up.

01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:40.140
This award goes to Dinesh D'Souza.

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.140
Now it's my honor to introduce another young lady.

01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:42.140
You know her father, Dinesh D'Souza.

01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:43.140
You see him all over TV.

01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:44.140
He couldn't join us today, but Danielle D'Souza's here.

01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:45.140
She's a strong pro-life young woman, the author of the book, The Choice.

01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:46.140
And I'm proud to introduce her to you today here in Washington, D.C., Danielle D'Souza.

01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:47.140
Dinesh D'Souza was invited.

01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:48.140
He said, fuck no, I'm sending my daughter.

01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:49.140
I'll send my daughter.

01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:50.140
Dinesh D'Souza.

01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:51.140
Dinesh D'Souza.

01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:52.140
Dinesh D'Souza.

01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:53.140
Dinesh D'Souza.

01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:54.140
Dinesh D'Souza.

01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:55.140
Dinesh D'Souza.

01:44:55.140 --> 01:45:16.060
Wow, wow, Jack, you didn't know you could half-ass it still further.

01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:17.060
Yeah.

01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:18.060
Lazy.

01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:19.060
Yep, so.

01:45:19.060 --> 01:45:23.460
Why did you not just say, why didn't you send in a video message announcing Melissa Carbone

01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:24.460
or whatever?

01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:26.020
Well, you know who did send in a video message?

01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:27.020
Dinesh D'Souza?

01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:29.020
No, Marjorie Greene, the QAnon person in Congress.

01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:33.180
Oh, the crazy person, yeah, yeah, yeah, all right, good for her, good for her.

01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:36.500
That was one of those, like, real curveballs in terms of, like, their booking.

01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:37.500
Yeah.

01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:43.460
I feel like you guys are trying to have an air of not out there too far.

01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:46.500
So we got the craziest Congressperson we could find.

01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:48.660
Well, and she only sent in a video.

01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:50.300
Yeah, that's not good.

01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:51.300
That's not good.

01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:52.300
It could be better.

01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:56.380
I think democracy is not always the most popular thing to do, and I've seen that.

01:45:56.380 --> 01:45:57.380
It's true.

01:45:57.380 --> 01:45:58.380
Yeah.

01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:02.100
So the next category, Jordan, is the second most likely day drunk person after the guy

01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:03.220
in a sequined shirt.

01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:04.540
Ooh, he's 100%.

01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:06.180
Yes, there's no competition.

01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:09.020
Yeah, no, that one's all the way up to full.

01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:14.540
Second place, however, second most likely, that honor goes to Boris Epstein, who I should

01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:20.660
remind you, the guy from Sinclair Media, I should remind you, tested positive for COVID-19

01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:21.940
on November 26th.

01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:25.860
Anyway, he showed up and he seemed drunk.

01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:29.740
Hello, America.

01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:35.860
I was told I shouldn't take the mic off, but I'm going to do it anyway.

01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:36.860
Right?

01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:37.860
Right.

01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:38.860
Who do we love?

01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:39.860
Who do we love?

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:40.860
We love Trump.

01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:41.860
We love Trump.

01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:42.860
Why?

01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:43.860
Why?

01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:44.860
We love Trump.

01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:45.860
We love Trump.

01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:46.860
We love Trump.

01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:47.860
We love Trump.

01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:48.860
We love Trump.

01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:55.260
Get the flags higher.

01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:56.980
We love Trump.

01:46:56.980 --> 01:46:58.700
We love Trump.

01:46:58.700 --> 01:47:00.020
We love Trump.

01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:05.780
I love that Boris is like, apparently didn't hear everyone yelling to put the flags down.

01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:06.780
Nope.

01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:07.780
Get those flags up.

01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:08.780
Get those flags up.

01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:10.780
Get the flags in the air.

01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:14.540
At two different events, people have been saying, put the flags down so we could stream

01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:16.380
and Boris is like, ah, fuck that.

01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:17.380
I don't know.

01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:18.480
I don't know if he's actually drunk.

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:23.480
It's really tough to tell because it also, I realized as I was watching this, it's hard

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:28.820
to tell the difference between like maybe kind of day drunk buzzed and sort of just

01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:35.100
jacked up off of being in front of a crowd this big and maybe doing those like standard

01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:37.500
get the crowd pumped up kind of things.

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.620
Like those sound crazy if you do that.

01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:40.620
You know?

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:41.620
Yeah.

01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:43.700
And those are the kinds of things that you instinctually do and you're drunk.

01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:47.060
Like getting a crowd to chant USA is really fun when you're drunk.

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:48.060
Yeah, that's true.

01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:49.060
Yeah.

01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:50.060
USA.

01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:54.780
I can't, that's, this is maybe the largest disconnect more than our politics even.

01:47:54.780 --> 01:48:02.480
The idea, any politician, the idea of saying, if me chanting, we love blank politician,

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:03.480
fuck that.

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.480
It seems weird.

01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:05.480
Period.

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:06.480
Yeah.

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:10.160
I think AOC is incredible.

01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:13.160
I'm not going to chant, we love AOC.

01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:14.160
Fuck that.

01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:19.320
I would tell myself that I think I would be just as like put off by seeing large crowds

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:21.880
chanting we love Obama back in 2008.

01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:22.880
Oh, creepy.

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:24.060
But maybe I wouldn't have been.

01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:25.640
Maybe that's a bias on my part.

01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:26.640
I don't know.

01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:27.880
I like to think that I would be.

01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:28.880
Sure.

01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:29.880
But I'm not certain I would.

01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:35.240
I mean we were much younger then and you know, Obama was coming out after the previous worst

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:37.040
president in American history.

01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:42.280
I like to think that I would respond the same, it'd be like weird.

01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:46.480
But I wonder if I would see that and I would give the like, sort of like, oh, they're not

01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:47.940
in a cult of personality.

01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:49.720
This is just expressing their political.

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:50.720
Sure, sure.

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:51.720
I wonder.

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:52.720
I like to think.

01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:55.640
I mean, I wouldn't, I don't know Obama, Jordan.

01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:57.680
That was significantly long ago.

01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:03.000
I would say the most recent is obviously the Bernie Sanders campaign in the primary in

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.040
2016 whenever he had those massive rallies.

01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:08.440
But even then, I don't remember people screaming like.

01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.760
People are chanting like feel the Bern.

01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:11.760
Something like that.

01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:16.640
And then it's like, yeah, it's like a weird all in this together, not like, we love you.

01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:17.880
You know, like that's creepy.

01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:20.080
His slogan was not me, us.

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:21.080
Yeah, exactly.

01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.080
Exactly.

01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:23.080
Yeah.

01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.080
We love us.

01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:25.480
I would be fine with chanting that.

01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:27.680
Yeah, I don't know.

01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:28.680
It's tough.

01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:29.960
I know that I don't like looking at it here.

01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:30.960
Oh, no.

01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:36.880
And I like to think that maybe even if I had turned a blind eye to it before, I would now

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:40.240
look upon people chanting like, let's say, I love AOC.

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:41.240
Yeah.

01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:43.040
And I would look at that much differently.

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.040
Don't.

01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:45.720
So maybe this has given me an illuminating moment.

01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:46.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:51.360
So we have another superlative, another title.

01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:54.640
Person who's putting the most direct.

01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:57.040
I didn't prepare this title.

01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:58.040
Oh, okay.

01:49:58.040 --> 01:49:59.680
This one's a little bit off the dome-y.

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:03.000
Person who's putting the most effort into getting people killed.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Okay.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.760
That goes to, I don't remember his name, but he's that gym owner in New Jersey who refuses

01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:08.760
to stay closed.

01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:09.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:15.280
If you would have asked me back in February, if I thought that one person could make a

01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:18.000
difference, I would have laughed and said, hell no.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.700
But here I am today.

01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:25.280
One man, a part of a team of two guys who stood up to a governor and told him, no, we

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:27.280
will not listen.

01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:32.160
And it's starting a movement across the country.

01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:36.640
They're trying that second wave that they've been predicting for so long and more and more

01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:39.200
businesses are staying open.

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:44.160
And I'm here to advocate every single freedom loving American to go out and support these

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:46.160
small businesses.

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:54.480
And I'm going to give you a way how we created a directory, a nationwide directory of businesses

01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:59.120
that are staying open, thinking of it as a Yelp for freedom loving Americans who won't

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:01.600
listen to COVID restrictions.

01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:03.240
I have a flaw in that plan.

01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:05.520
So go out there and support.

01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:10.480
That is www.stayopenstayfree.com.

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:11.480
Check it out.

01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:14.940
Go encourage businesses to sign up and go support them.

01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:18.360
Because the more that do, the quicker this thing will fall apart, I promise you.

01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:21.800
This works equally well as a registry of businesses to avoid.

01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:22.800
Yeah.

01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:23.800
Yep.

01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:24.800
Yep.

01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:25.800
Wow.

01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:26.800
Yeah.

01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:28.440
I didn't think that one man could make a difference.

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:36.040
But now look at me, the horsemen of plague, spreading COVID to all who come near me.

01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:37.040
Yeah.

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:38.040
Jesus Christ, King Midas.

01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:39.880
That might not age well.

01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:40.880
Yeah.

01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:46.120
So I went and I looked at this guy's registry and I looked for Chicago and there's exactly

01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:50.400
one business in the city of Chicago and it is an apartment building.

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:54.640
Which is just like, all right, I guess.

01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:57.120
I guess if that's where you want to promote.

01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:58.120
Yeah.

01:51:58.120 --> 01:51:59.120
Yeah.

01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:00.120
Seems silly.

01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:01.120
Okay.

01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:02.120
It's a Gold Coast apartment.

01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:03.120
Well, that doesn't surprise me.

01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:04.120
Yeah.

01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:06.480
If it was going to be anywhere, Gold Coast is where...

01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:08.120
I don't know if this is what that was for.

01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:10.240
I think this is more about like, retail, right?

01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:12.040
Yeah, I was thinking so.

01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:13.040
Yeah.

01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:14.040
I don't know.

01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:15.040
Cool.

01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:17.160
So next apartment of Jordan is actually a tie.

01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:18.160
Yes, sir.

01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:19.160
This is very shocking.

01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:20.160
Okay.

01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:21.160
Most insane preacher.

01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.160
Ooh, there's two.

01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:23.160
Two.

01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:24.160
It's a tie.

01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:30.880
This one goes to Reverend Locke out of Tennessee.

01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:37.320
If you're glad to be on the winning side, let's make some noise, DC!

01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:40.960
I read the back of the book and it doesn't end with, oh me, it ends with, amen, and this

01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:43.040
thing is going to turn out all right.

01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:47.280
We're not going to back up, we're not going to pack up, we're not going to slack up, and

01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:51.760
we're not going to shut up till we've been taken up by the glory of God, and I am convinced

01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:54.800
that Donald J. Trump is going to remain the President of the United States.

01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:57.680
Do you believe that this afternoon, patriots?

01:52:57.680 --> 01:52:58.680
Have you met my snakes?

01:52:58.680 --> 01:52:59.680
Oh my God.

01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:00.680
Yeah.

01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:01.680
Dude.

01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:02.680
Dude.

01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:03.680
We've got a revival preacher on our hands.

01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:04.680
Come on, buddy.

01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:10.560
We're getting a lot of different particular flavors of exciting preachers, and that's

01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:14.360
why it has to be a tie, is because these guys have completely different styles.

01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:15.360
Okay.

01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:18.320
But Reverend Locke, or Pastor Locke, who knows.

01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:19.320
Whatever.

01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:23.040
He does not ask permission when he wants to tell the devil that the devil is on notice.

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:24.040
I think he should.

01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:27.360
No, I didn't ask permission, for I said it and never do, but let me tell you something,

01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:29.240
I serve notice on the devil.

01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:30.880
This guy is an auctioneer.

01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:32.720
I was actually thinking that exact same thing.

01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:36.600
I was like, man, you have a gift for saying words fast and dumb.

01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:38.640
Do not do this job.

01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:40.640
He's very exciting, verbally.

01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:41.640
Yeah.

01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:42.640
And that's why, yeah.

01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:47.120
I never asked the devil for a goddamn piece of permission, but I will tell you this right

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:52.840
now, everybody, we see five over there, and now it's ten over there, ten, I have twenty

01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:56.720
over there, twenty, twenty over there, all right, and the Lord says so.

01:53:56.720 --> 01:54:01.800
That's where it's functional, but unfortunately, he uses his gifts to yell about how everyone

01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:04.040
will be forced to bow in front of Jesus.

01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:05.040
That's not good.

01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:09.680
That in the name of Jesus, every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth

01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:15.560
and things under the earth, and that every, I said that, every Republican, every Democrat

01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:21.680
shall bow and with their voice proclaim him Lord of Lords to the glory of God the Father.

01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:26.760
So you have a choice, and the choice is clear.

01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:32.560
We can declare Jesus Lord of our life right now because we want to, or we can declare

01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:36.960
Jesus Christ Lord of our life in the day of judgment because we have to.

01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:41.400
But make no mistake, Jesus Christ is Lord.

01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:46.880
And I want you to chant, King of Kings, King of Kings.

01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:54.480
Yeah, so that guy is scary in many ways, but the vocal patterns are fun, so I'll get him

01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:55.480
mad.

01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:56.480
King of Kings.

01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:57.480
Yeah.

01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:58.480
Oh boy.

01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:02.760
So the next guy who's tied here for this most insane preacher is a guy named Brian Gibson,

01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:04.520
and I actually found this kind of endearing.

01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:05.520
Okay.

01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:10.760
His wife brings him up, introduces him on stage, and you don't know that it's his wife

01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:17.160
initially because she's just like, this next speaker is just my favorite person, he's my

01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:18.160
husband.

01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:19.560
Oh, that's cute.

01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:20.560
It's adorable.

01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:21.560
All right.

01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:25.720
And then Brian Gibson, Pastor Brian Gibson, complains about how his Easter service didn't

01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:26.720
work.

01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:27.720
I hate my wife.

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:28.720
No, it didn't work.

01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:29.720
His Easter service didn't work out.

01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:30.720
He was going to try and give eggs to children.

01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:31.720
Okay.

01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:34.440
On Easter Sunday, I blew a fuse.

01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:37.020
I put together an Easter egg giveaway.

01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:40.440
We were going to give some kids an egg in the name of Jesus.

01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:45.360
The health department called me, said if I gave those eggs away, that they would shut

01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:49.460
down the church of the Lord Jesus Christ.

01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:51.200
You keep those fucking eggs.

01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:54.320
The health department is accused to not give up those eggs.

01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:58.060
I swear to God, that's your bitching.

01:55:58.060 --> 01:55:59.320
That's what you're complaining about.

01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:00.320
You keep those eggs.

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:01.320
Wow.

01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:06.080
And I'm going to tell you, no one has the authority to shut down the church of the Lord

01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:10.880
Jesus Christ, except Jesus Christ himself, when he returns to church.

01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:14.640
Come on, give God a hand clap, if you believe it out there.

01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:17.080
Give God a hand clap.

01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:19.200
Does God need applause?

01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:20.200
Yes.

01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:22.840
I organized a parking lot communion service.

01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:24.920
I called all of the press.

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:30.520
I said, come out, tell the governor I'm distributing communion elements and they can come arrest

01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:35.160
me because I'd love to go to jail for the preaching of the gospel.

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:36.760
That's not what you would be going to jail for, sir.

01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:38.760
You were not actually preaching gospel.

01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:41.600
Used to every time I got drunk and coked up, I got arrested.

01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:42.600
What's up with that?

01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:43.600
What is up with that?

01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:44.600
What is up with that?

01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:45.600
Yeah.

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:46.600
What is up with that?

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:48.440
Now I can't get arrested for preaching?

01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:49.440
No.

01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:50.440
Wow.

01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:51.440
Oh boy.

01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:52.440
Kind of a little bit telling there.

01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:53.440
A little bit there.

01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:59.840
Anyway, he would not make the cut if it weren't for his just extreme Christian nationalist

01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:00.840
leanings.

01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:08.800
Let me say this, America did not birth the church.

01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:14.320
America did not birth the church, but the church birthed America.

01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:15.320
Not true, sir.

01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:16.320
Sir, sir.

01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:17.320
Excuse me.

01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:23.240
And the only thing that will save America is the same thing that birthed America, the

01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:25.080
church of the Lord Jesus Christ.

01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:26.080
So yeah, I mean this is just-

01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:29.720
I was going to go with King George, but I guess I was wrong.

01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:30.720
Nope.

01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:31.720
I guess I was wrong.

01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:32.720
I guess I was way off.

01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:34.840
What about that whole no taxation without representation thing?

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:35.840
Wasn't that really important?

01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:36.840
Or was it-

01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:37.840
Church.

01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:38.840
Is it just church?

01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:39.840
Church.

01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:40.840
All right.

01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:41.840
Okay.

01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:42.840
You realize that the Puritans were kicked out-

01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:43.840
Church.

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:44.840
Because they hated them.

01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:45.840
Church.

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:46.840
Because everybody hated them.

01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:47.840
Again-

01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:48.840
Because they're the worst.

01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:54.280
These two preachers are at the one that is not the more religiously branded one.

01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:55.280
Wow.

01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:56.280
Jesus.

01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:57.960
They're at the one that wasn't the product of a vision.

01:57:57.960 --> 01:57:58.960
Yeah.

01:57:58.960 --> 01:57:59.960
Yep.

01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:02.920
I'm trying to tell you that all of this is-

01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:10.060
You know, I want to say, I want to say, religious people, come get your guys or you get what

01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:12.060
you get, man.

01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:13.060
That's mockery?

01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:14.060
That's mockery.

01:58:14.060 --> 01:58:15.060
Oh.

01:58:15.060 --> 01:58:16.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:18.040
I don't blame decent religious people for this.

01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:20.560
I blame religion for this.

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:22.920
That's an interesting conversation I don't want to have right now.

01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:23.920
Fair.

01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:24.920
Fair point.

01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:25.920
I do want to give out the next award.

01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:26.920
Okay.

01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:27.920
And this is the last award.

01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:28.920
All right.

01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:31.800
It's a bewildering transition between speakers.

01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:32.800
Okay.

01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:38.000
This begins with a woman whose name is either Anna Kate or Anna K. It's hard to tell from

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.000
the intro.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Okay.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000
The intro is a guy named Matt Couch.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Sure, sure.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Who's giving her the intro.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000
He's a guy-

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.000
From mycouch.com.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:46.000
No, no.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.000
There's a great promo code.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:50.520
He's a dude who really did some damage to the Rich family, the Seth Rich conspiracy

01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:51.520
shit.

01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:52.520
Oh, he did.

01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:55.040
I don't know what the fuck anyone's doing ever letting him speak in public again.

01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:56.040
Wow.

01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:57.040
Fuck me.

01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:01.840
She's giving the intro to either Anna Kate or Anna K. No idea.

01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:08.020
She's a very devout Trump worshiper who's apparently been in prayer for 40 days straight,

01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:11.280
and I guess she's breaking that now to give the people of this rally an update.

01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:13.500
How dare you fucking lie like that?

01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:15.160
You lie piece of shit.

01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:20.760
She says that prophecy has promised that Trump will be given two consecutive terms, so therefore

01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:22.400
he must have won.

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:26.400
After saying this, she's got a message for the devil.

01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:32.340
The second message is for the devil and his minions and all the wizards and witches that

01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:36.200
are watching right now all over the world.

01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:37.200
This is for you.

01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:38.200
We're going to do a chant right now.

01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:39.200
It's for me?

01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:41.200
We're going to do a chant because it's awesome to exalt Trump.

01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:42.200
Oh, no.

01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:43.200
You're going to chant?

01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:44.200
Trump is our anointed one.

01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:45.200
He's your anointed one.

01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:46.560
To bring justice back into this country.

01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:47.560
Not justice.

01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:49.720
I do worry that I'm one of the wizards.

01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:51.440
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you're a wizard.

01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:52.440
Yeah.

01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:53.440
Yeah, without question.

01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:56.360
I think that no matter what the reality is, I would be looked upon as a wizard.

01:59:56.360 --> 01:59:57.360
Totally.

01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:58.360
Totally.

01:59:58.360 --> 01:59:59.360
No, it doesn't matter.

01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:02.720
Honestly, even if there was no religion, I'm still looking at you just going like, you

02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:04.560
got a real Lord of the Ringsy vibe to you.

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:07.480
I've been forced into the role of a wizard.

02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:09.080
I mean, you leaned into it though.

02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:15.620
You're erudite, you're obsessive, you live on the third floor, you're in a tower, if

02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:16.620
you will.

02:00:16.620 --> 02:00:17.620
Come on, buddy.

02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:19.400
You're John D reincarnated.

02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:20.400
All right.

02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:21.400
Fine.

02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:22.400
I'm a wizard.

02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:25.040
Anyway, this lady chants for Jesus.

02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:27.000
She wants to chant Jesus' name.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.160
Is the devil weak to chants?

02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:30.160
Yes.

02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:31.160
Oh, okay.

02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:32.160
Shit.

02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:33.840
I know that because I'm a wizard.

02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:38.880
So they chant Jesus and then she repents for abortion, which is apparently a blood sacrifice

02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:39.880
to Baal.

02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:40.880
Sure.

02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:44.240
Count of three, we're going to chant Jesus because this was a vision I had a few weeks

02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:48.560
ago because it's shifting in the atmosphere now in Jesus' name.

02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:49.560
Lord, we repent.

02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:54.440
Before we chant his name, Lord, we repent for all the blood sacrifice that has been

02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:55.960
poured out in this nation, Lord.

02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:58.600
We repent for abortion, Lord God.

02:00:58.600 --> 02:00:59.760
The sacrifice is to Baal.

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:00.760
We exult you, Lord.

02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:03.440
So yeah, and then they start chanting Jesus.

02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:10.560
Now, Jordan, here is the transition that is outrageous and made me laugh out loud while

02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:12.760
hours into watching these stupid rallies.

02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:14.360
This is your second rally?

02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:15.360
Yes.

02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:16.360
Oh boy.

02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:19.360
And I loved this moment more than I can really put into words.

02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:24.000
So mic down for this, enjoy this minute and 15 second ride.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Jesus.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Jesus.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Jesus.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Jesus.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Jesus.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Glory to God.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.000
We're going to see a miracle.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Amen.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Amazing.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Right?

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:50.800
Hey guys, right here in the middle, if we could keep the flags down, we have some guys

02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:54.480
at RSPN who have been with us the whole way.

02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:55.480
They're amazing.

02:01:55.480 --> 02:02:00.040
Let's block at the shot and we want to make sure people at home can enjoy it too.

02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:02.040
Thank you guys.

02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:03.480
Yeah.

02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:07.000
Just right here in the center between us and the cameras, everybody else.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:13.200
We love you guys as flags are amazing and we love RSPN because you guys need to be watching

02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:14.200
them.

02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:17.840
All right, next up, we're going to mix it up.

02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:28.080
We're going to bring some amazing artists out here, Bryce and Graham, 4G out of Blow.

02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:33.080
Y'all ready to turn up?

02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:36.120
It's hard for me to move around with this mic though.

02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:37.240
All right.

02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:43.300
So what's happened here is that we started with the lady chanting Jesus who had a message

02:02:43.300 --> 02:02:48.000
for the devil and the wizards, and then my drunk friend comes back out.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.680
He tells people to keep those flags down, a little bit more admin, a little bit of business,

02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:55.600
and then he introduces a rap act.

02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:58.880
There's a rap concert.

02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:02.760
It was easier to have religious epiphanies before technology, I imagine.

02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:09.060
No point during the sermon on the Mount was Peter like, hey guys, guys, we are leaving

02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:11.720
too much bread around.

02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:16.680
There is a lot of bread going around on the floors, it is attracting too many birds, birds

02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:18.040
are getting in the shot.

02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:19.600
This is not hitchhock.

02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:21.560
And now a rap concert on the Mount.

02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:24.000
And now a rap concert on the Mount.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.160
So yeah, this guy named Bryson Gray comes out to do a little rap set.

02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:29.160
All right.

02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:30.160
He has a couple albums that he's put out.

02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:31.160
All right.

02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:33.240
One's called Maga Season, spelled S-Z-N.

02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:35.120
Oh, he's hot.

02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:38.520
Another one, another album called Maga Christmas.

02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:49.880
Another, another album called Maga Ain't Got No Color, and his other album, Can't Cancel

02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:50.880
God.

02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:56.320
So, was it his label who wanted the Christmas album or was it?

02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:01.420
So I went and I listened to a little bit of his stuff and I got to say he's serviceable

02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:03.280
as an actual rapper.

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:04.920
He's not good.

02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:05.920
As a lyricist?

02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:06.920
Yes.

02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:12.680
And as someone who's delivering words over beats, he's not as bad as a lot of people

02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:13.680
I've heard.

02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:14.680
I will say that.

02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:17.560
And I think he's just not, he's not anything interesting.

02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:19.720
I don't find anything compelling about it.

02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:24.720
It's largely just like rapping, you know, sort of conspiracy talking points and Trump

02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:25.720
shit.

02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:26.720
I don't really care.

02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:29.440
But I went and I actually found a review of one of his albums.

02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:32.640
It was shocking because like the review really agreed with me.

02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:36.680
Like he's not terrible, but this is boring.

02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:40.600
I like that because it was like, yeah, this review isn't insulting him.

02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:42.920
It's not like saying he's a shitty rapper.

02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:44.920
It's like, you're not doing anything interesting.

02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:46.680
It's kind of uncompelling.

02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:48.680
You have some skill or whatever.

02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:49.680
Oh man.

02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:50.680
No, you hate my politics.

02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:55.280
Honestly, your politics, I do hate them, but we're talking about the music here, buddy.

02:04:55.280 --> 02:05:02.180
If you could deliver your politics in an interesting artistic way, I might still appreciate what

02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:06.440
you make, even if I disagree with what you're putting out, possibly.

02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:08.920
I might be able to get there, but you're just boring as hell.

02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:11.360
Look, everybody knows Cecil DeMille, okay?

02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:12.360
We get it.

02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:13.360
Yeah.

02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:19.560
So he comes out with another rapper whose name I forget because I don't care, but they

02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:23.560
have some tech issues at the beginning and so they have to vamp for a little bit.

02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:24.560
Of course they have to vamp.

02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:25.560
And then the music starts.

02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:29.600
And this is the last clip because what ends up happening is just perfect.

02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:31.600
It could not be more perfect.

02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:33.280
I think that this sums up everything.

02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:37.320
Who out here is disappointed in the Supreme court decision yesterday?

02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:41.200
God, God told the Patriots.

02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:45.160
They thought they was going to kill our spirit, but we still out here and we still live Trump

02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:46.160
2020 on a gang.

02:05:46.160 --> 02:05:51.520
Y'all got to say I'm working.

02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:52.520
I heard the play.

02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:53.520
Did you hear?

02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:54.520
Oh, here we go.

02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:55.520
I love the second amendment.

02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:56.520
Y'all ready?

02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:57.520
God gave it to me.

02:05:57.520 --> 02:06:13.240
Not one politician.

02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:35.840
God told him Bible reading, God believe in truth, speaking American, it's magazines and

02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:36.840
Democrats.

02:06:36.840 --> 02:07:02.360
They go away from the rap concert to do a MyPillow commercial.

02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:03.360
Wow.

02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:08.520
Uh, guys, guys, you were supposed to get the, uh, you were supposed to get the version without

02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:09.520
the lyrics.

02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:13.360
I just wanted to the instrumental guys, guys, the instrumental it's rapping with me.

02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:14.360
Yeah.

02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:15.360
It's rapping with me.

02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:16.440
Mostly the track.

02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:18.360
I'm supposed to, what is this riff raff?

02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:20.120
I'm supposed to actually perform.

02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:21.120
Yeah.

02:07:21.120 --> 02:07:23.720
One of the things that I found really interesting too, is if you watch this video, there's a

02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:26.560
guy who looks like Napoleon dynamite on stage.

02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:27.560
Wow.

02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:28.560
Gotta have him.

02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:29.560
I don't know what this dude is doing.

02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:35.840
I can't tell if he's with them and there as a visual joke that he's dancing along with

02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:40.640
them or whatever, or if he's like from some other outlet cause he's carrying like a stick

02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:41.640
mic.

02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:42.640
Sure, sure.

02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:43.640
Of course.

02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:44.640
I don't, I have no idea what's going on.

02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:45.640
It's bewildering.

02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:46.640
It's modern Forrest Gump.

02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:50.320
We're going to find a movie about that guy 20 years from now and he's going to be everywhere.

02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:51.420
It's outrageous.

02:07:51.420 --> 02:07:53.840
He will have inserted himself into the Vietnam war.

02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:59.080
I can't tell you how like weird, like obviously we're recording this on Sunday and this was

02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:00.240
all happening on Saturday.

02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:04.600
And so in order to make this really work, it ended up like I had a really late night

02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:05.660
last night.

02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:12.040
And so I'm like, you know, late into the evening watching these banal speeches and then hearing

02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:18.760
this lady being like, we must chant Jesus name and then a rap concert break it out.

02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:21.440
I was so amused by it.

02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:25.880
And then the fact that the broadcast goes straight to a MyPillow commercial in the middle

02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:31.560
of maybe the most energetic thing they had on their stage the entire time.

02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:35.800
It just was kind of disrespectful to this very serviceable rapper.

02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:36.800
Jesus.

02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:38.360
Jesus Christ.

02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:39.360
Indeed.

02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:43.760
That is, that has got to be the most surreal night I can think of.

02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:50.040
Like to go that, so just to ride that all the way through to like three.

02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:53.520
See now if you were just watching one rally, no big deal.

02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:54.520
Sure.

02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:56.560
No big deal, no big cuts, but you, you listen to Alex Jones.

02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:57.560
Yeah.

02:08:57.560 --> 02:08:58.560
I have a high tolerance.

02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:01.440
But you're watching seven straight hours of rallies.

02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.560
At least.

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:08.080
Seven straight hours of rallies on after a long day into the wee hours of the morning.

02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:09.080
Yep.

02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:13.360
And at a certain point, didn't you have to just have a complete break from reality?

02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:17.320
I kind of did think at a certain point I was making up what was happening.

02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:21.560
It feels like you, that must have been, that's how I would feel if you're telling me this

02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:22.560
happened.

02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:23.560
It was surreal.

02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:24.760
I was doing it by myself.

02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:25.760
Do you know what I mean?

02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:26.760
Yeah.

02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:32.000
There were, there were a couple points where I thought like, this is self parody.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Yeah.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:37.400
There, there is no way Mike Flynn's speech started with a MyPillow ad.

02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:38.400
It can't be.

02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:40.880
Why is this guy giving out MyPillow codes?

02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:41.880
It can't be.

02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:42.880
This is nonsense.

02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:44.600
This cannot be as a thing.

02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:50.640
It's, it's so tough to like really put your hands on what this is.

02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:51.640
Yeah.

02:09:51.640 --> 02:10:00.920
It's, it's simultaneously a terrifying display of different levels of explicitness about

02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:03.040
a desire to live in a Christian theocracy.

02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:04.040
Yeah.

02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:10.400
You know, it's not about, um, standing up for your right to be able to practice your

02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:11.400
religion.

02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:15.160
It's about enforcing your religious beliefs onto the government, making the government

02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:20.600
adhere to your religious beliefs at the expense of everyone else who does not share your beliefs.

02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:21.600
You got it.

02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:22.600
It's horrifying.

02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:23.600
Horrifying.

02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:28.640
Because you have the, you know, the, the Jericho March, which is maybe, you know, obviously

02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:31.320
more upfront about it.

02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:33.320
It's called the Jericho.

02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:37.560
But it shares overlap in funding and speakers with the same other March.

02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:43.360
And quite honestly, I think that the people that I heard on the other March, the women

02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:48.480
for Trump or women for America first, there was more Christian nationalism probably on

02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:49.480
display there.

02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:50.480
Yeah.

02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:53.320
They, they did, they didn't have someone like Leon Benjamin saying, we got to kill the devil

02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:54.320
so our kids don't have to.

02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:55.320
There was that one.

02:10:55.320 --> 02:11:02.760
There was a little bit more speak freely going on over there, but I, I think I'm more scared

02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:07.540
of the women for America first rally, honestly, because they're smart enough to not allow

02:11:07.540 --> 02:11:08.540
Alex there.

02:11:08.540 --> 02:11:09.540
Right.

02:11:09.540 --> 02:11:13.280
It's, it's fascism packaged by Coca-Cola.

02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:19.840
Like it is, it is so much, and well, yeah, I mean, that's that like tying together of

02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:31.260
just base base commerce, just fucking promo code level commerce with fucking your ostensible

02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:34.720
belief system, which we all know is complete bullshit.

02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:40.160
If you, if you think anything that those rallies had to do, those rallies had zero to do with

02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:41.160
Christianity.

02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:42.160
I agree.

02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:43.160
Zero.

02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:45.320
It's a mask that's being worn.

02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:46.320
100%.

02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:49.800
And one of the things that's really difficult is that like, I don't, I'm not saying that

02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:52.680
of everybody who's in the crowd again.

02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:57.920
Like I think that there's probably maybe some sincere and misled people who are there.

02:11:57.920 --> 02:11:58.920
Sure.

02:11:58.920 --> 02:11:59.920
I don't know.

02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:00.920
I can't, I can't say.

02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:01.920
Yeah.

02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:08.120
But I don't think that, I can't imagine that the people who are putting this on are motivated

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:11.240
by a sincere spirituality.

02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:12.240
Absolutely not.

02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:16.140
It's very difficult for me to accept that and maybe it feels that way to them.

02:12:16.140 --> 02:12:17.140
I'm not sure.

02:12:17.140 --> 02:12:18.140
It's very difficult to judge.

02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:23.920
I wrestle with this because it's something that's so intimate and personal within someone

02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:30.520
like true religious feelings and whenever you sort of criticize somebody about their

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:37.200
sincerity or lack thereof, it kind of comes off as if, oh, you think you have sincere

02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:38.200
beliefs.

02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:39.200
No.

02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:41.960
And I don't, I don't want to get into that kind of an argument, but this is gross.

02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:45.960
Here's, here's what I would say about that.

02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:54.160
If your beliefs are sincere and you're looking for Christ and all that stuff, go read the

02:12:54.160 --> 02:13:00.060
Way of the Pilgrim and really, really like meditate on Thessalonians and the idea of

02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:05.080
praying every day and every moment and what that actually means.

02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:09.160
Or you could go to a rally and try and overthrow a nation and kill a bunch of people.

02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:10.160
Yeah.

02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:16.480
The novelty that I have is the combination of both of these rallies being so explicitly

02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:26.120
like Christian nationalist in character, so overt about it and both of them being so crass.

02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:32.000
Like the joke, like we're laughing our asses off at all the MyPillow stuff, but like that's

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.640
it both of these rallies.

02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:35.040
It's happening at both of them.

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:36.040
So fucked.

02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:43.880
And the parody level of the like praying and chanting Jesus into a drunk guy introducing

02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:44.880
a rap act.

02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:45.880
Just ridiculous.

02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:46.880
Like it's bizarre.

02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:47.880
It's surreal.

02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:53.800
And I don't know what to do with it, but I do think that like Alex Jones got a lot of

02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:58.400
headlines out of crashing that Jericho March one.

02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:00.340
And so it does come into our view.

02:14:00.340 --> 02:14:04.720
And I think that one of the things that's important, I guess, is to take what we know

02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:09.760
about Alex and what we understand about that and glimpse the external world a little bit

02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:16.640
when there is a chance to, and quite honestly, looking at these people, some of whom I'm

02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:21.140
aware of, some of whom I'm not, who are chosen by these people who are organizing these rallies

02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:25.560
to give these speeches, I don't see a lot of difference between what they're putting

02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:27.400
out there and what Alex does.

02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:28.400
Nope.

02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:34.040
And that is not how I felt even like, even when we look back at like 2009, like even

02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:38.640
when the Tea Party was going on, there were still substantive differences between the

02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:40.520
Tea Party and Alex Jones.

02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:41.960
Alex was more severe.

02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:42.960
Yeah.

02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:49.380
He may be more severe than some of these people and more extreme, but like these rallies,

02:14:49.380 --> 02:14:55.480
I don't understand why, except for bad press, they would not let Alex speak at both of them.

02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:56.480
I don't know.

02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:57.480
I don't get it.

02:14:57.480 --> 02:14:58.480
I don't know.

02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:01.480
I don't get why they have to parade around even at the Jericho March with the code.

02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:02.480
Pretending that he's not there.

02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:08.040
And the code of like in the spirit of inclusion and you know, like all that, like go fuck

02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:09.040
yourself.

02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:11.800
He's right on board with exactly what you're, he's doing what you're doing better.

02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:12.800
Yeah.

02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:19.720
The idea that they are still allowed to, like that was Alex's role for Fox News and the

02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:23.580
Rush Limbaugh's and the Glenn Beck's is for them to be like, hey, at least we're not like

02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:24.580
Alex Jones.

02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:25.580
Right.

02:15:25.580 --> 02:15:29.240
They're all like that and they're still trying to act like by saying, hey, at least we're

02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:33.880
not Alex Jones in Info Wars, we still get a, we still get that difference.

02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:35.400
You're not, there's no difference.

02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:36.400
There's no difference.

02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:37.400
No.

02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:40.240
Well, I mean, so how dare you act like you're too good for Alex.

02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:44.100
If there is, I'm mad on it, I'm mad on his behalf.

02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:45.100
Don't feel that way.

02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:46.100
I don't.

02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:50.120
But I think, I think that, you know, I can see where that thought comes from.

02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:51.120
Yeah, of course.

02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:57.240
It largely comes from the reality that if you watch that rally, you'll see a difference

02:15:57.240 --> 02:16:00.920
in competence from Alex and the rest of the speakers.

02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:01.920
Yep.

02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:06.880
If the, if the goal is to rile up this crowd, God damn it does Alex do a better job than

02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:07.880
any of the rest of them.

02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:13.720
Even at that point when he's like getting not allowed on stage, he gets the crowd to

02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:14.720
chant his name.

02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:15.720
People are still chanting, we love Alex.

02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:16.720
Yeah.

02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:17.720
Yeah, totally.

02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:20.360
Gets on the bullhorn and yells 1776 and people start chanting his name.

02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:21.720
And that's how you fucking do it.

02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:22.720
Right.

02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:27.120
He can do all this better than all of you, but unfortunately his brand is so toxic that

02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:31.000
no one, even Ali Alexander wants to admit that he basically works for Infowars.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Yeah, no kidding.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:35.280
So, I mean, it's kind of like, I don't know.

02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:40.760
I think that this kind of sums up what I think is one of the main problems.

02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:45.120
Who's had it with these fact checkers?

02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:47.720
Haven't you had it with these fact checkers?

02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:50.200
That could almost be the big problem.

02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:51.960
That's probably a better way of putting it.

02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:52.960
Yeah.

02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:55.880
I think, I think when you cheer for fuck fact checkers.

02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:57.280
Who's up with all this reality?

02:16:57.280 --> 02:16:58.280
Yeah.

02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:01.320
Who's up here with, I'm sick of it, I'm sick of it.

02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:02.320
Let's live in a dream world.

02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:03.320
Let's live in a dream world.

02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:05.320
Who wants to live in a dream world?

02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:06.320
Boo.

02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:08.480
Hey, who likes to confirm things?

02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:09.480
Boo.

02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:10.480
Boo.

02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:12.080
Read a book.

02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:13.920
The mind is the fear killer.

02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:16.280
Fear, fear, mind killer.

02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:17.280
Boo.

02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:18.280
Yeah.

02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:24.320
So I thought this was an interesting exploration, a little bit sort of, not fully outside of

02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:27.200
our realm but sort of to the side of it a tiny bit.

02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:28.200
Sure, sure.

02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:35.400
And it bummed me out more than usual just because it's like, oh, all these people chanting

02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:40.360
and cheering and all these speakers sounding very similar to Alex.

02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:44.320
It's a bummer and I think we have a very large problem in front of us that I do not know

02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:45.320
how to deal with.

02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:46.320
Yeah.

02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:53.440
And I think that it's important to recognize that one of the major problems is the blurring

02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:54.680
here.

02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:56.120
This is not political.

02:17:56.120 --> 02:17:57.320
This isn't about politics.

02:17:57.320 --> 02:18:00.200
This is not about policies.

02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:01.760
This is something else altogether.

02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:07.920
And trying to approach it from the standpoint of arguing or politics, it's not gonna work.

02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:09.560
It's absolutely not gonna work.

02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:11.200
Here's my pitch, all right?

02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:18.920
Now I think one of the speakers did point out that the nation was created and now he

02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:25.400
said it was created by God and I would argue that it was created because of King George

02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:27.600
and the like and his ilk.

02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:29.240
Who's had it with these fact checkers?

02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:30.240
All right.

02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:36.040
But maybe we should learn something from King George, Dan, okay?

02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:37.040
What did King George do?

02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:39.280
I already dispute your premise because I hate fact checkers.

02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:44.500
What did King George do or what did the king do when faced with Puritans?

02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:50.600
They were causing a ruckus and then he was like, get the fuck out, and then they all

02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:51.600
left.

02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:52.600
Yeah, I know.

02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:53.860
So we shoot him to the moon, Dan.

02:18:53.860 --> 02:18:59.440
This seems too much like those mentalities that I find kind of noxious, which are the

02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:00.440
like, you don't like it, get out.

02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:01.440
I was being facetious about this.

02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:02.440
I was being facetious about this.

02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:05.520
I know, but even as a joke, I don't really like it because it sounds so much like the,

02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:08.080
you know, you hear this rhetoric from Trump people.

02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:11.800
You know, like Trump being the president, get out.

02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:14.560
And I just don't think that's a good solution either.

02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:15.560
Sure.

02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:16.560
I don't know.

02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:17.560
I don't know.

02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:21.040
It's a, it's a tough time to be in the middle of this because I don't really know how the

02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:22.040
ball breaks.

02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:25.400
Well, steadfast tolerance of intolerance clearly isn't working.

02:19:25.400 --> 02:19:26.840
No, I would agree with that.

02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:27.840
Kicking people out.

02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:29.880
That's not a great solution.

02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:31.880
Didn't work last time.

02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:33.480
No.

02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:34.680
Violence doesn't work.

02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:36.360
Violence doesn't do it.

02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:39.760
Maybe we should try using like those.

02:19:39.760 --> 02:19:41.760
So it's like 2020, right?

02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:49.240
And that means that before 2020, there was like a bunch of years and humans and they've

02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:51.960
probably dealt with some shit like this before.

02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:53.240
We should probably try smarts.

02:19:53.240 --> 02:20:00.160
Well, I wish that I had this clip because actually a really great general, Michael Flynn,

02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:01.160
you might've heard of him.

02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:02.160
I've heard of him.

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:03.160
Yeah.

02:20:03.160 --> 02:20:05.160
In his speech, he discusses how this has never happened in human history before.

02:20:05.160 --> 02:20:06.160
It's never happened.

02:20:06.160 --> 02:20:07.520
So actually we can't learn anything from history.

02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:10.080
It's a completely new and unique situation.

02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:15.600
It's really convenient how we can't know anything about this because it's never happened before.

02:20:15.600 --> 02:20:17.320
So unfortunately you're wrong.

02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:19.920
All those book learning idiots, this has never happened before.

02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:20.920
Don't listen to them.

02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:22.520
Yeah, they're a bunch of dumb fact checkers.

02:20:22.520 --> 02:20:23.520
Fuck them.

02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:24.520
Fuck them.

02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:25.520
God damn it.

02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:26.520
I don't know.

02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:30.280
Anyway, we'll be back on our next episode talking more specifically about Alex Jones,

02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:32.840
but I don't know.

02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:33.840
These rallies sucked.

02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:34.840
They sucked.

02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:35.840
Anyway, we'll be back.

02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:37.800
But until then, we have a website.

02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:38.800
We do have a website.

02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:39.800
It's knowledgefight.com.

02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:40.800
Yep.

02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:41.800
We're also on Twitter.

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:42.800
We are on Twitter.

02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:43.800
It's at Knowledge Fight.

02:20:43.800 --> 02:20:44.800
Now go to Ben Jordan.

02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:45.800
We're also on Facebook.

02:20:45.800 --> 02:20:46.800
We are on Facebook.

02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:49.720
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

02:20:49.720 --> 02:20:50.720
doing God's work.

02:20:50.720 --> 02:20:51.720
Yes.

02:20:51.720 --> 02:20:52.720
We'll be back.

02:20:52.720 --> 02:20:53.720
But until then, I'm Neo.

02:20:53.720 --> 02:20:54.720
I'm Leo.

02:20:54.720 --> 02:20:55.720
I'm DZX Clark.

02:20:55.720 --> 02:20:56.720
I'm Daryl Rundis.

02:20:56.720 --> 02:20:59.680
I am about to go buy a red sequin smoking jacket.

02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:00.680
Andy in Kansas.

02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:01.680
You're on the air.

02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:02.680
Thanks for holding.

02:21:02.680 --> 02:21:03.680
Hello, Alex.

02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:04.680
I'm a first time caller.

02:21:04.680 --> 02:21:05.680
I'm a huge fan.

02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:06.680
I love your work.

02:21:06.680 --> 02:21:35.680
I love you.
