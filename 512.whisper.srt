00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,040
Damn and Jordan, I am sweating

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,400
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,880
I have great respect for knowledgefight

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,160
knowledgefight

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,400
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,920
saying we are the bad guys

00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,200
Damn and Jordan, knowledgefight

Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,480
I need, I need money

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,320
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,160
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,720
Stop it, Andy and, Andy and Kansas

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,120
Andy, Andy, it's time to pray

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,400
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding me

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,800
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm with your Japan

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,000
I love your room

Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,760
I'm Jordan

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,440
We're couple dudes, I can sit around, drink knowledge

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,280
beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,400
Oh indeed we are Dan

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,840
Jordan

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,160
Dan

29
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,480
Jordan

30
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
I have a quick question for you

31
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:08,920
Yes sir

32
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,720
What's your bright spot today?

33
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,880
My bright spot today is, you know, just the recognition

34
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,440
that, you know, decades from now, centuries from now

35
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,760
this will be looked upon as the week of too much of you and me

36
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,080
Quite a week of too much of us

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,560
Dan, I think that you are underestimating exactly how much more we're going to do in the weeks to come

38
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:43,280
This is an extensive week of programming between our episode on our Patreon

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,960
our little bonus episode and then also thank you to Robert and Sophie

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,160
Yes, huge thanks to Robert and Sophie

41
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,480
Behind the Bastards and I got to bring up something, I got to bring information to the table

42
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,200
that everyone is unaware of

43
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,640
Yes

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,160
About invention from Goldwater

45
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,480
Yes, I do recall that

46
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,880
Yeah

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,280
Yes

48
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,200
That's something we've talked about on this show but apparently was new to the proceedings

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,680
I would say that you were so excited to

50
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,440
Very excited

51
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,480
You were incredibly excited, you were shivering and shaking almost as though there was

52
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,280
like a bug in my pants

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,840
You know, it's just something I couldn't feel but it was there

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,160
So yeah, I guess that's my bright spot, too much of us

55
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,480
Yeah

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,120
How about you?

57
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,040
My bright spot is Dan Taylor Swift

58
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,880
Taylor Swift is my bright spot because you're so mad

59
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,200
I was worried about this

60
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,600
No, yeah, I decided to start listening to every Taylor Swift

61
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,720
I've never listened to Taylor Swift at all

62
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,280
You've never been to a Walgreens?

63
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,000
On purpose or in full, is that a better way of putting it?

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,440
So I've never done that before and then I was, I've really been struggling to come up

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,040
with a project since the book ended and I've just been like throwing shit at the wall and

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,000
it's not been going well

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,240
Well, here comes another piece of spaghetti

68
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,360
For some reason I was like, you know what, now I'm going to do it so I've decided to

69
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,520
listen to every one of Taylor Swift's albums in a row, chronological order and review each

70
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,040
one

71
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,000
We talked about this a little bit and I resent you for this because I think it's going to

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,520
have a really negative tone

73
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Oh man, is it dark

74
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:20,960
Yeah

75
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,480
It is very fun to be incredibly mean to a seventeen year old who is going to go on to

76
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,320
be a billionaire

77
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:33,120
Yeah, but I also resent that at this point you're still at a point where I can't really

78
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,360
rebut anything you're saying

79
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,640
Of course

80
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
I don't know anything about Taylor Swift's first album

81
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,480
Sure, sure, sure

82
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,440
But if you start getting real shitty about some of those later albums we might have words

83
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,280
I think if you read it you will find that I am very complimentary towards things that

84
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,960
deserve complimenting

85
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,080
And I am hyperbolically incredibly cruel to things that are just meh

86
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,520
Okay

87
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,320
You know, that's kind of how I like to do it

88
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,760
I'll check it out, where can people find this?

89
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,320
People can find it on a friend of the show Matthias Drufki's website fancyboysclub.com

90
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,600
I'll be posting those probably once a week or until I get really pissed off at Taylor

91
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,280
Swift and decide never to do this again

92
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,560
And if I get bored enough I will write scheming rebuttals

93
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
I think that would be fun

94
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,840
But there will be only personally attacking you

95
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,680
Yes, I would love that

96
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,160
There's nothing to do with the music, just personally attacking you

97
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,000
What you should do is do the exact same thing but for each chapter of my book

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,400
Right

99
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,160
Every week we'll just hate each other

100
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,440
Has Jordan ever written a pop masterpiece?

101
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,320
No

102
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,240
Absolutely not

103
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,800
Alright, well Jordan today we've got an interesting episode to go over

104
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,840
We're going to be talking about December 16th and 17th, 2020

105
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,920
I'm Dan, this is 2020

106
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,200
Hooray!

107
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,760
Shit got interesting and weird this week so we're going to have a little bit of a, I don't

108
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,160
know, memento style

109
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,520
We're going to start with December 17th

110
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,120
And then we're going to go back

111
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,720
I've heard some news

112
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,520
Yeah

113
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,200
So before we get to the episode, let's take a little moment to say thank you to some folks

114
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,800
who have signed up and are supporting the show

115
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,320

Next, Jonathan T, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

132
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm a policy wonk

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,720
Thank you very much JT

134
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,040
And...

135
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,560
Hmm?

136
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,200
What?

137
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,120
Triple T?

138
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
Are you talking about home improvement?

139
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,120
Couple JTTs?

140
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
No.

141
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,120
And finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on an elevated

142
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
level.

143
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
We appreciate that very much.

144
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,600
So, Big Easy Blasphemy, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

145
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
And Cory S, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

146
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
I'm a policy wonk.

147
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic.

148
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Have yourself a brew.

149
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
How's your 401k doing, bro?

150
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,000
All right, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,500
Let's just get down to business.

152
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,560
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

153
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,500
Why you pimps so good?

154
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,140
My neck is freakishly large.

155
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,840
I declare info war on you.

156
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,360
Thank you so much, Big Easy Blasphemy, and thank you so much, Cory.

157
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,840
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

158
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,400
If you're out there listening and you're thinking, hey, I enjoy this show, I'd like to support

159
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,240
what these gents do, you can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com, clicking

160
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,920
the button that says support the show, or...

161
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,240
What you could do is create some sort of tortured analogy towards trying to find writing something

162
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,760
about Taylor Swift into a generosity thing.

163
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,440
But I would just suggest that you guys go to your local charity or bail fund and support

164
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
people that way.

165
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,400
Go to the easy road on this show.

166
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,840
Man, it was just gonna be, I was thinking about it on the way here.

167
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,560
You were trying to get a little too meta with it right there.

168
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
I was trying to, yeah, yeah, yeah.

169
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
It was tough.

170
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
It's a tough one.

171
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Yeah, that's all right.

172
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,480
So, I wanted to play The Sound of Silence to start this episode, but that would be very

173
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,000
hacky, so I decided not to.

174
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh, well, real quick, I have one piece of business, just real quick, right off the top.

175
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Somebody reached out to me.

176
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,120
Nothing to do with The Sound of Silence.

177
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,320
Nothing to do with The Sound of Silence, completely unrelated.

178
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:12,160
Somebody reached out to me, and she asked me politely if we would wish her partner a

179
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,920
happy birthday.

180
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,760
His name is Joe, and I was told that the way to identify him was that he skips over our

181
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
theme song.

182
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
Oh, shit.

183
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,880
Yeah, which then made me be like, am I even gonna fucking do this now?

184
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,880
There we go.

185
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,880
We're gonna play it again.

186
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
That's what's gonna happen.

187
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Take that.

188
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,880
Yes, yes.

189
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
Happy birthday, Joe.

190
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,880
Happy birthday, Joe.

191
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,600
I hope you have a good one.

192
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,880
It's been a tough year for everybody, you know, everybody who had a birthday this year,

193
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,880
wasn't their favorite birthday, I'm sure.

194
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,880
Totally.

195
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,880
Mine wasn't.

196
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
Nope.

197
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
Nope.

198
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
And hey, here's the other thing.

199
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
What's up?

200
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,280
If you are dating a Joe, or married to a Joe, or whatever with a Joe who also skips over

201
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,720
the theme song, tell them it was you.

202
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Tell them it was you.

203
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
We won't tell.

204
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Totally.

205
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
I'm not saying anything.

206
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
I'm not gonna follow up on that shit.

207
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
We're not snitches.

208
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
I'm sorry to lie to your partner.

209
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,840
I built a strong relationship.

210
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,880
And now, back to The Sound of Silence.

211
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,880
Yes, indeed.

212
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,520
Hello Darkness, my old friend.

213
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,840
I couldn't help but like find, I was, look, okay.

214
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,640
Beginning of the week, we had the rallies in DC, and then I was kind of planning on

215
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:28,280
this episode to like cover the very predictable and obvious reactions Alex would have to it.

216
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,400
But then, today, Thursday, as it was getting game time to do this episode, we got hit with

217
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
some big news.

218
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,960
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

219
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:43,720
At Libertyterion on Twitter, the one person at Infowars who has managed to duck getting

220
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,160
banned because he's too boring for anyone to notice is there, David Knight announced

221
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,760
that he was fired, effective immediately, from Infowars.

222
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Oh boy.

223
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,320
Stevie P's got to him in the end, huh?

224
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't know if that's the case.

225
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,840
That is the obvious thing that you would think, because David Knight has been on a bit of

226
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,960
a public vendetta against Steve Pachanik, who has been trying to convince people at

227
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:14,120
Infowars that the election was a grand sting operation, and David Knight's not having any

228
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
of that bullshit.

229
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,640
David Knight fired for being inexplicably a half-truth teller.

230
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,480
To his credit, he responded appropriately to that.

231
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,680
Although to not his credit, he also, you know, the last time he had Steve on, he said, yes,

232
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,440
I believe Sandy Hook was a false flag, but I will not agree with you about Las Vegas.

233
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,880
So I don't know where his line is.

234
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,120
He's a half-truth teller.

235
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,480
Yeah, and this big, this big news, and I don't want to shit on somebody when they're down

236
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,160
or like make fun of it, but I mean, like, it's relevant to our interests.

237
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,800
David Knight has been there forever.

238
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,120
He's been there 10 years, probably?

239
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Something like that.

240
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Totally.

241
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,800
He has always been there through the thick and thin of so much horrible bullshit.

242
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,440
Went along with Alex as he got into Trump.

243
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,620
Maybe Alex just remembered that David Knight was there, and he was like, shit, I meant

244
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,120
to fire him five years ago, and then I just forgot.

245
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,400
He's just so boring.

246
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,600
I don't know.

247
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,120
I'm actually kind of conflicted.

248
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,660
I'm not entirely sure what I think the case is here, and I think we'll discuss this as

249
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,660
we go through the episode.

250
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,280
So we're going to start with the 17th, and we're going to start with Alex's conversation

251
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,920
about, because I think he knew he needed to get ahead of this.

252
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,800
And so he has fired David at this point.

253
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
We're past it.

254
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Yes.

255
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,720
And so Thursday's show, he's going to deal with some housekeeping business for a little

256
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
bit.

257
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,640
First thing I want to say, the tank was a good idea.

258
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
It was a good idea.

259
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
Solid investment.

260
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,280
It was a good investment.

261
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,600
Anyways, we have lost some personnel.

262
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,960
The tank brings in more money than David Knight, sells more pills.

263
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,800
So we're going to look at that, and then we're going to flash back to the 16th, and we're

264
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,680
just going to discuss what kind of content was going on there, because I got just bored

265
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,800
as hell after Alex stopped talking about current events of his own issues.

266
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,600
So here's an out of context drop from today's show.

267
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Now I don't want to liken myself to a US president, but this job is about as close as it gets.

268
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Okay.

269
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
All right.

270
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
I mean, currently, maybe.

271
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Maybe.

272
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,840
Look, I talk shit and vaguely read headlines.

273
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,640
I'm basically the president.

274
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,200
Pretty close.

275
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,800
Pretty close when you get down to it.

276
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,760
I get lied to by weirdos as a profession.

277
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
Yeah.

278
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,240
I too like Stephen Miller.

279
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,400
So I kind of had a sense that it was going to be something that Alex has to bring up,

280
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,360
because David Knight has made this public.

281
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,600
He's come out with it.

282
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:53,520
So Alex frames things this way when he gets going on the show on the 17th and he was late.

283
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
He was late for the show.

284
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:00,040
There was some special reports at the beginning, and I've got a really huge announcement coming

285
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,280
up at the bottom of the hour about the future of info Wars and about this organization and

286
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,160
a restructuring we're going to be doing that'll be announced today.

287
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,600
I've waited long enough and I've told folks about how we're under attack and what's going

288
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,480
on with info Wars, and I don't think people take that serious sometimes.

289
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,960
But info Wars is fighting for its life, just like the rest of the country and the rest

290
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
of the world is.

291
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
We don't get globalist money.

292
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,920
We didn't get the $10.6 million that black lives matter got from the new world order.

293
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
And the only money we get is from you.

294
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,600
And we can't fight if you don't support us.

295
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
We'll be right back.

296
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Stay with us.

297
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,560
So there's restructuring going on in the info war.

298
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
Yes.

299
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,560
There's demotions.

300
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,560
Clearly.

301
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Yeah.

302
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
There's nothing really specific yet at this point.

303
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,720
There's just kind of like the insinuation that we're going to talk about what the future

304
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,280
is going to look like around here.

305
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
Yeah.

306
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,280
Yeah.

307
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Yeah.

308
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
And I podcasts.

309
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
They're the future.

310
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,120
I grow weary of this quite honestly, because we've been, we've been on this track before

311
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,560
we've, we've done some laps around this, uh, granted the move of firing David Knight.

312
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,080
That one wasn't really big.

313
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
That's a big one.

314
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
Yeah.

315
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,280
That one's tough to, to undersell.

316
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,240
That's, that's tough to look at as like, Oh, you're just blowing smoke.

317
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Yeah.

318
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
There's something there.

319
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,760
Now, whether it's like a resources are tight.

320
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,720
I got a call from Melania and she said, get rid of David Knight.

321
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Sure.

322
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,760
Is it the Steve situation or is it a money?

323
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
Yeah.

324
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
I don't know.

325
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
Could be.

326
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
I don't know.

327
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
I can't tell.

328
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
So, uh, I was like, what else is going on here?

329
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,240
Alex got anything to talk about other than your own dumb bullshit.

330
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,920
Trump tried to turn our economy back on, get us out of the global system.

331
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,240
He did really a splendid job on many fronts, made some big mistakes and still with 34 days

332
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
left.

333
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,960
If he levels with the American people in resolute desk speeches and asked for 10 million Americans

334
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,360
to March on Washington peacefully, but to March on all our other capitals, to demonstrate

335
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,600
that we know there's massive election fraud and that we repudiate the globalist corporate

336
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,500
media, the NWL has a very good chance of folding up and backing down.

337
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,640
Because then the justice department and others will have the courage to do the right thing

338
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
and prosecute.

339
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:19,680
So Alex is pretending that bunch of people could go March and then the new world order

340
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,000
would be like, Oh no.

341
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah.

342
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah.

343
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What about plan B?

344
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Nah, it's a show of force.

345
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What about plan B?

346
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What about plan B?

347
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah.

348
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
There's 10 million people in one spot.

349
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,120
You can't do plan B when they're all there.

350
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
That would be perfect.

351
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
That's when you gas them all.

352
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
There's too many.

353
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,480
That's when you hit the bio weapon.

354
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,920
That's what plan B is.

355
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,480
There's not enough bio weapon, it would be too diffuse and everybody would get a little

356
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
sick.

357
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,480
That's not how a bio weapon works.

358
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,040
This is a super bio weapon.

359
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,280
You forgot that plan B is a super bio weapon.

360
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,760
Yeah, a super bio weapon hits 5 million people in one place max.

361
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
That's twice as many.

362
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,720
I just, I just can't, I can't get it up for this kind of thing.

363
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
No, this is sad.

364
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
He doesn't even believe it.

365
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
No.

366
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,520
I can't, I can't handle the guy trying to tell me that like, Oh, we just need a bunch

367
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,520
of people to March and then maybe the cabal of people who've been planning this for thousands

368
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,360
of years will be like, Oh no, people, when Alex has already said that there's a plan

369
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,420
B, if all of, if they manage to like, even if they get Trump back in office, there's

370
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,840
a plan B that's just everyone dies, but it's a little less organized.

371
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
Yeah.

372
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Like I don't, I don't, how, how, why, what does this matter?

373
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
I don't know.

374
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:31,220
But the idea of the devil who has been with humanity since there were two and now there

375
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,660
are several billion of us for him to be like, Whoa, 10 million is just too much for me to

376
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,660
look.

377
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,400
I got to tell the NWO to back off.

378
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,800
That's just mathematically a little bit problematic because you have to assume that the new world

379
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,080
order would be doing the devil's bidding.

380
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
They would have to.

381
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
Right.

382
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,880
The only reason that they're doing the things that they're doing is because the devil has

383
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,600
told them that they should.

384
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Right.

385
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,800
And I mean, yeah, if the devil is like, who cares about 10 million people marching, it's

386
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
no big deal.

387
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,760
You'd assume they would just keep going with their plans.

388
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,880
Does the devil phone or does he appear?

389
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
I don't know.

390
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,400
He seems really interested in domestic politics.

391
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
He really does.

392
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,400
I feel like he should get a phone.

393
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,720
It's a whole big world out there for the devil.

394
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Does the devil email?

395
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,880
Cause if he's appearing everywhere, this is, this is, this is stupid and it feels trivial

396
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,360
even within Alex's own conspiracies.

397
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
I just don't care.

398
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
No, this is dumb.

399
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,000
So how about you get back to your bullshit, Alex, I want to hear more about your, your

400
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
situation.

401
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,600
And info wars, I'm giving you the good news.

402
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,880
Info wars has three to five times the audience on a day-to-day basis that we've ever had

403
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,680
except for right around the last election.

404
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,960
And that's despite all the de-platforming.

405
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,160
What we do not have is the funding we had then.

406
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,720
And so I'm the type of guy that has kept everybody employed, kept the shows going, kept us in

407
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,400
the, in the field, kept funding everything, mortgaged my house a year ago to be able to

408
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:03,720
have emergency funding, to, to, to run this operation, to, to take care of shortfalls.

409
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,760
But I can look at the other things I have as, as an emergency backup, and it wouldn't

410
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,760
fund this place for a month if I had to liquidate everything I've got.

411
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Cause this is a big operation, our own satellites, our own IT, our own feeds, our own everything,

412
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,480
all the DNC lawsuits against us, everything.

413
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
Wait, wait, wait, the DNC lawsuits?

414
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
DNC?

415
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
DNC lawsuits?

416
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Uh, I don't know about that.

417
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
What are the DNC doing?

418
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,240
Uh, also I think that's called being overextended.

419
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,240
Yeah.

420
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

421
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
That's, um...

422
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,040
You could, you could also put that thusly, um, we should have scaled back.

423
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
Mm-hmm.

424
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Mm-hmm.

425
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
Long time ago.

426
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Yeah.

427
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
No reason to not have.

428
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,040
Mm-hmm.

429
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,360
That tank was a bad purchase.

430
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,600
No need for that tank.

431
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,000
Um, this studio looks great.

432
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It looks amazing.

433
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,440
Completely pointless.

434
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,240
Maybe too big for just one person to sit there.

435
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Yeah.

436
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Yeah.

437
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Could be too big.

438
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
Maybe a little ostentatious.

439
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Ostentatious.

440
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
Oh, ooh.

441
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,880
The stumble upon a pun that Ralphie May made years ago with the name of one of his specials.

442
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Yeah.

443
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
I don't like that.

444
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
I remember that.

445
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
Mm-hmm.

446
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,400
Anyway, uh, look, you need to buy his products cause Alex needs money.

447
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Sure.

448
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
And you know what?

449
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
You need them too.

450
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
You need the products too.

451
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,360
I had one of the crew members over here, tore his leg, had some medical stuff, went to the

452
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
doctor.

453
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,040
They wanted to put him on stuff for his low, low T. He didn't do it.

454
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Got tested again.

455
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,200
He came in on Monday or Tuesday, he said, look at this, I got tested, started taking

456
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,120
super male vitality and look at my numbers.

457
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
It was incredible.

458
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
I had to check with lawyers.

459
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
We can even show you this stuff.

460
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
There's the other system.

461
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,780
So you're not supposed to know what herbs can do, but that's the type of things that

462
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,520
are happening and that are going on.

463
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,320
And I'm just here to tell you, and you've come through over and over again.

464
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,360
I keep telling you, we can't keep operating.

465
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,120
We can't keep doing it at this level.

466
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,240
If you don't support us, if you don't pray for us, if you don't spread the word, we're

467
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,800
way more hardcore than Newsmax, OAN, everybody else.

468
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,880
And I love them.

469
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,840
I hope they get more hardcore than I am.

470
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,840
And I like OAN.

471
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,160
You know, we're on cloud TV.

472
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,160
Number one.

473
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,120
OAN and Newsmax are the worst thing that could happen for Alex.

474
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

475
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,660
The fact that those two outlets are doing slick shit, they have some sort of financing

476
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,880
from some mysterious source, I'm sure.

477
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,800
They have better than 19 year olds working in their rooms.

478
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,160
They have the ability to pretend that they're news.

479
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,160
They don't act like Alex screaming about the devil.

480
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,480
They say the same shit.

481
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,480
Absolutely.

482
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
They get to...

483
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
They have...

484
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
They're like all David Knights.

485
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
Yeah.

486
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,120
They have the editorial standards of Alex, but the appearance of a news thing.

487
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
Yeah.

488
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
It's the worst thing ever for Alex.

489
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,040
He has no place in the market anymore, unless he does something different.

490
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:56,080
He has to pivot, or else it will just be, I'm another one of them that no one will plug

491
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,960
because I suck, because I'm so toxic.

492
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
It's funny.

493
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,960
I kind of think Alex is confused by that, because I really do think that when he sees

494
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,600
his set and the way his show runs, he's like, this looks like a news organization.

495
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Yeah.

496
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
You know?

497
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
He totally thinks that.

498
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Yep.

499
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,160
So how can he look at OAN and Newsmax and be like, they're just like me.

500
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
You know?

501
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
Isn't that wild?

502
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,200
I don't think he watches anything other than...

503
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Oh, that's fair.

504
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,480
I bet he doesn't have the time for it, nor the interest.

505
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
That's fair.

506
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,720
I think it's actually kind of interesting that because those things exist, things like

507
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,440
Newsmax or OAN, David Knight could easily get a job at either of them.

508
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,640
They've accidentally created employability for the people that work for Alex.

509
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
Right.

510
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,160
Who art Alex?

511
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,080
They've created a situation where he can't hold people hostage working at Infowars anymore.

512
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,040
If you have aspirations to be a right-wing shit journalist, there are other options now.

513
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Yeah.

514
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Yeah.

515
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Alex.

516
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Oh, God.

517
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,460
I think the good news is Schroyer's not going anywhere.

518
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,480
I don't think so.

519
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,380
Even after, you know?

520
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,800
Nobody's hiring...

521
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,640
Even Newsmax is going to see OAN Schroyer walk in and be like, and you may turn around

522
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
now?

523
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,280
I can't tell exactly from listening to this, but it does appear that OAN is the only other

524
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,680
person who survived the axe.

525
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,960
Oh, shit.

526
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,120
The axe.

527
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,520
Like straight up axe.

528
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
We'll get to it.

529
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Oh, boy.

530
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
Now I'm excited.

531
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
I might have shown my cards too early.

532
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
You might have shown too many cards.

533
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,640
But we should know that Alex is being very clear that he's not quitting.

534
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
Okay.

535
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,560
And so, you know, I said on Joe Rogan's show five weeks ago, I said, I've thought about

536
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:42,080
retiring and the media thought that was just, you know, Jones trying to act like he's this

537
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,080
reluctant hero.

538
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,600
But that's not what it is.

539
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Reluctant hero?

540
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,840
I only dream about this stuff 90% of the time, used to 5% of the time.

541
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,400
I have basically no life other than this.

542
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,720
That's all I do and I still feel like I'm not doing enough, but I'm not going to quit.

543
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,240
I can't imagine it being his life and him being so bad at this.

544
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Yeah.

545
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,800
What are you putting time into?

546
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
I don't know.

547
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
I don't know.

548
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,820
What could he possibly be?

549
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,040
In regards to the show, okay, you've dedicated your life to this show.

550
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:21,240
You talk for three to four hours for being a very generous day.

551
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,240
Yeah.

552
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
Or someone cancels.

553
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Right.

554
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,240
Right.

555
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,240
Right.

556
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,000
And you read and I think something happens while you are holding a thing.

557
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,060
He reads headlines.

558
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,560
There are words that he sees that then become brain thoughts, but I don't know what reading

559
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
would be for him.

560
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,820
The only thing I can imagine that would take a lot of time is maybe it requires like extensive

561
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:49,200
meditation or yoga in order to get into his like prophetic psychic trance or whatever

562
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,000
that he says he can kick himself into.

563
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Okay.

564
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,360
So he reads headlines and then like gets into some kind of a weird trance state.

565
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,360
Sure.

566
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,440
And then he reports on what the trance showed him about this headline as opposed to reading

567
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
the article.

568
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
Yeah.

569
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
Yeah.

570
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
Because that would take too much time.

571
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
Do you know what his mantra is?

572
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
What's that?

573
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,440
Soros.

574
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Soros.

575
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,440
Soros.

576
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,440
Soros.

577
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,440
I can't.

578
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,440
I just can't imagine it.

579
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,800
Like because he doesn't need to practice talking shit.

580
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,880
He's really good at it.

581
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,080
No, he's ecstatic at it.

582
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,080
Yeah.

583
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,720
He doesn't take time is preparing and he clearly doesn't do that.

584
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,160
So I don't know.

585
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,480
Anyway, this is not the end.

586
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,520
It is a new chapter.

587
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,600
So it's been the greatest pleasure of my life, 27 years on air, knowing all of you and fighting

588
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,240
the new world order and doing all of this.

589
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,200
And I'm not going anywhere yet, but you need to know a new chapters here.

590
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,560
You know, when I tell you that the CIA follows us around and the FBI and the secret service

591
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,640
now, and they come and sit down next to us at the restaurants and tell us that they come

592
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,600
visit us at the hotel and turn our cell phones off so we can't videotape them.

593
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,880
And that, you know, the former director of the CIA comes out and says he wants me arrested

594
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
on Twitter.

595
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,420
That isn't me scared.

596
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,640
That's not me afraid.

597
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
It's me lying.

598
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,760
That's just InfoWars entering a new chapter of life.

599
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,200
Embellishing probably more than lying because Michael Hayden did tweet an agreement with

600
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,240
somebody who tweeted that Alex should be arrested for his statement about Biden at that rally

601
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
over the weekend.

602
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,240
Yeah.

603
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:27,440
Um, yeah, I, I don't know the new chapter, what is a new chapter?

604
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
What does that mean?

605
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
What does that entail?

606
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,960
And I, I, you can sum it up with a song title, no more, mr nice guy.

607
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,440
And so I'm here to tell you that I'm not going to back down and I'm going to do exactly what

608
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,280
I think is the most moral and best thing to do.

609
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:55,360
And that starts with not being a nice guy anymore, not, not, not being delusional about

610
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,920
where we stand and what we can do and the fact that I have this tendency to never even

611
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:12,520
shake up things in my own operations because I'm so loyal, even though to the point of

612
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,440
their operation, not being able to function.

613
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,880
So up to this point, you'd been an mr nice guy.

614
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,880
That speech.

615
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,640
I can only hear that, like imagining him just giving it directly to the mirror as he's putting

616
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,220
the joker makeup on, you know, like he's, he's just given this like, no more mr nice

617
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
guy.

618
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,220
All right.

619
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,220
Put a little bit more rouge.

620
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,400
The problem with me and the reason I've gotten to this point is I'm too loyal, too loyal.

621
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,640
I've never met Wolfgang never met anybody.

622
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,640
He's the crack.

623
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
And who's cracking.

624
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
We changed the crack.

625
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,640
But Donnie didn't work here.

626
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,640
I don't know that guy.

627
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,640
Never heard of him.

628
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Never met him.

629
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,480
So look, a lot of people are gone.

630
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,600
And without mentioning David Knight by name, of course, there's some other people that

631
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,880
you might've gotten used to seeing it in for us that aren't around anymore.

632
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,080
And so I pledge to you that I'm going to work harder in the fight against the new world

633
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080
order.

634
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,800
And I'm asking you to fight harder against the globalist, but I've already explained

635
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,600
to you, we had to let Caitlin Bennett go.

636
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,400
Cause we couldn't pay her anymore.

637
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,920
We had to let Millie Weaver go and, and God bless Caitlin.

638
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,440
She hasn't made up a bunch of stuff about us as we let her go.

639
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,920
You've seen what Milly's done.

640
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
God bless her.

641
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
It's okay.

642
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
She did a lot of great work in the past.

643
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
No, she did not.

644
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
No, no, no.

645
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,120
I like the idea that Alex is trying to pretend that he didn't fire her for shadow gate.

646
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
That's fun.

647
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
Yeah.

648
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,620
How could she make up all of this stuff?

649
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,120
When I literally said, I don't get into that stuff.

650
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
It's too scary.

651
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,540
This is the gate of yeah.

652
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:43,280
That weirdo guy from your film showed up at my studio and then was talking about Roger

653
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,760
Stone in ways that I don't appreciate.

654
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
You're fired.

655
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
You're fired.

656
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
You're fired.

657
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,760
Oh, it was finances.

658
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,760
Sure.

659
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,520
I hate that she's making up that stuff.

660
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
Yeah.

661
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,040
But like, because of things in finances and the difficulties that Alex is in, the situation,

662
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,680
he's had to cut back a whole bunch, you know, like there were people like Millie, there

663
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,000
were people like Caitlin Bennett that he was funding and now he can't, he can't do that

664
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
anymore.

665
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,320
But three, four years ago, when I still had plenty of money, I was funding dozens of organizations,

666
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,040
dozens of groups that were doing great work.

667
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,780
I was taking the money you sent us buying products and sending it out where I thought

668
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,500
it was key to fight the new world order.

669
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:27,640
I'm down to funding three or four organizations outside of our own operation now I've been

670
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,440
cut back to a hill I'm on and I'll die on this hill.

671
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,040
But everybody sits here and hears me say that you don't think I'm serious.

672
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,940
So we're going to have to reorganize and we're going to have to rethink what we're doing.

673
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,740
I'm going to stay on the air four hours a day.

674
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,080
So was on for three hours a day.

675
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,240
I've got a council, the nighttime election countdown show, just because there's not the

676
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,240
crew.

677
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
There's not the funds.

678
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
There's not the money.

679
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,540
And we're going to reorganize some of the other shows and then revamp them and relaunch

680
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:03,680
them because I never give up, but I can give out second old horse, you know, horses will

681
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,520
run and run and run until their heart blows up.

682
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
Yeah.

683
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,480
He's like a, he's like a horse, uh, with his, uh, with his heart, um, about to blow up.

684
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
Yeah.

685
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
Run, run faster.

686
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Keep going.

687
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,480
So, um, from that clip, what I take away is the election countdown with Deanna Lorraine

688
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,480
and Robert Barnes over.

689
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
That's gone.

690
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
There's no staff for that.

691
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,480
Fuck it.

692
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
Sorry.

693
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
Barnes.

694
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
Alex is going to be on still and Owen.

695
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
Yeah.

696
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,040
Conspicuous in its absence from that list is the only other show and that's the David Knight

697
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
show.

698
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
Well, there's that one.

699
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,920
So you're going to retool and revamp these shows, but obviously the, you know, according

700
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,320
to David Knight's Twitter, he got fired.

701
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,800
So you're going to revamp it with somebody else, I guess.

702
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Uh, yeah, probably.

703
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,760
Uh, he wants to bring in a younger crowd.

704
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,880
So, you know, 11 or 12 year old video game streamer is probably who he's going to hit

705
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,880
things with hammers.

706
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
Exactly.

707
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,880
Yeah.

708
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
Yeah.

709
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
He's electric.

710
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,200
Harrison Smith is probably the best they have there.

711
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
And that's bad.

712
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Yeah.

713
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,200
That's not good.

714
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
Really bad.

715
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
No, no, no.

716
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
No, no, no.

717
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Uh, you can wear shades.

718
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,520
Uh, you don't need to actually.

719
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:15,240
So, um, like, uh, I, I think that this metaphor too is a little bit rough and I don't appreciate

720
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
it.

721
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,520
Alex talking about, you know, you can, you're a horse and you're just running until your

722
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
heart gives out.

723
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,480
David Knight had a heart attack last year and then he came back to work because he was

724
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,040
so passionate about this shit.

725
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,040
That's very funny.

726
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,120
Like, like I don't look, I don't want to be this guy.

727
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
Sure.

728
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,400
Like giving a shit when it's not my time to give a shit.

729
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,400
Sure.

730
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,080
But like David Knight gave a lot to this.

731
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,080
He did.

732
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,040
And we are now a couple of weeks before Christmas.

733
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
Uh huh.

734
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,760
Alex is fucking firing him.

735
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,760
Yeah, absolutely.

736
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
That's so bad.

737
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
Ah, come on.

738
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,760
That's so shitty.

739
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Come on.

740
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,080
Everybody was like, Oh, feel bad for Bob Cratchit.

741
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,400
What did, when did they think about how Scrooge was like a fucking horse who was going to

742
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,200
steal everybody's money until his heart gave out?

743
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,160
Nobody's thinking about Scrooge here.

744
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
Okay.

745
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
This is dirty man.

746
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,840
He's doing him dirty.

747
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,960
He couldn't wait until the new year.

748
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,960
What?

749
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,840
God, I just, I just want, I just hope that David Knight is overwhelmed by not like sadness

750
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:22,520
or regret or like anything other than just like, I am so stupid for coming back after

751
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
that fucking heart attack.

752
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
Well.

753
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,720
I should never have fucking done that.

754
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,320
I have a slightly different hope and that is that I hope it gets ugly.

755
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
Like yeah, I do too.

756
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,680
Not for his like, uh, like nothing negative for him or anything, but like, I hope he kept

757
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
some receipts.

758
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,680
Oh yeah.

759
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
For sure.

760
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,360
I hope there's some, uh, real fun.

761
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
Oh yeah.

762
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:47,040
Uh, but hey, look, uh, Alex is this horse and he's running and he needs a break.

763
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,840
Any good horse will run till its heart blows.

764
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
It won't stop.

765
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,520
You keep running a horse, it'll go till it dies.

766
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:59,600
And um, you know, I've met a physically, but also physically got to that point.

767
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,240
I can't stop working.

768
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,520
I've got to take a week off.

769
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,040
I've got to turn everything off.

770
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,000
I've got to do it.

771
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,240
And it doesn't matter where the middle of the shine battle because I know when smokes

772
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,000
coming out of the race car engine, you got to pull over and get it, get it, get it oil

773
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
put in there.

774
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah.

775
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You got to put some oil in there.

776
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Sure.

777
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Yeah.

778
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You got to take a week off Alex.

779
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
We got to put oil in the horse.

780
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You just went to DC.

781
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,800
You just took a, took a trip to DC.

782
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
That was work.

783
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
That was work.

784
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
That was work related.

785
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Yeah.

786
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,360
I mean, he stayed in a nice hotel and ate really well, but he should have gone with

787
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,360
Owen on the caravan.

788
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,360
That would have been a fun road trip.

789
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,360
That would have been a nice time.

790
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
That would have been a nice time.

791
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
That would have been a nice time.

792
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
That would have been a nice time.

793
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,360
You guys could have bro-ed out.

794
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,360
Work-cation.

795
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,360
Bonded.

796
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
Yeah.

797
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,360
The whole thing.

798
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,360
Yeah.

799
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,360
Uh, take a, take a week off Alex, please.

800
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,360
Yeah.

801
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,240
Uh, so I was wondering like, what's the, this clip confused the hell out of me because Alex

802
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,600
describes what his last straw was.

803
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
Okay.

804
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
And it's something that doesn't make any sense.

805
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,480
And so I thank you all for your support and I love you and I appreciate you.

806
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,940
Uh, and I, and I, the last straw was this morning I got up and I saw this number, black

807
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,320
lives matter raised 10.6 billion since may.

808
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,600
When you go in a coffee shop like Starbucks or anywhere and they say, give it a black

809
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
lives matter.

810
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,400
That's just the communists and the globalists and Soros collecting money.

811
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,000
The DNC on record got 4 billion out of it.

812
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,720
Of the 10 billion last time I checked, look how much the DNC got of that.

813
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,040
That was a few months ago.

814
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,440
That was 4 billion that I'd read.

815
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,360
They'd gotten who knows what it is now.

816
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,280
Um, that's all just miss, uh, misinterpretations of the act blue stuff.

817
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,440
But um, yeah, I don't know why black lives matter getting a certain amount of money would

818
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,880
be the last straw for him in cause it doesn't materially affect what he's doing at all.

819
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,680
No, if I understand correctly, I wrote this down as I was tracking the thought.

820
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
All right.

821
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:54,280
So I wrote down first BLM raised 10 billion and then so I fired David Knight.

822
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,440
Is that the, is that the if then statement that I think we're going for here?

823
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,240
Cause I feel like that's what he's saying.

824
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,200
There's a weird feeling of it, but I think if you distill it down even more, it's like,

825
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,580
I saw that black lives matter made $10 billion and I'm not making close to that and it pisses

826
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,580
me off.

827
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,580
Yeah.

828
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:16,800
So I'm going to fire David Knight and uh, Deanna Lorraine and well, she might've been

829
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,040
like, I always got the sense that she was just kind of like a temp.

830
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
She's an independent contractor.

831
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,440
She was there on a little bit of a assignment or whatever.

832
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,440
She got a cup of coffee.

833
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Yeah.

834
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,760
She wasn't there for any kind of long term thing.

835
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,120
I just, uh, yeah, I don't know.

836
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,120
I'm very conflicted because there's two sides of this that I think of.

837
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,540
One is like the, uh, David Knight had run afoul of Steve Pachannik in a very serious

838
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,540
way.

839
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,000
And that is something that is hard to have in house.

840
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Right.

841
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,280
If you have somebody who is your intro show on your network right before you, who's saying

842
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,680
that one of your experts is a piece of shit liar, that's hard.

843
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,840
That's going to be tough to maintain the status quo.

844
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Right.

845
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,340
And you're a media outlet that is built entirely around bombast.

846
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:11,120
So it seems fairly simple to be like, okay, well we've got the most boring man ever and

847
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,320
we've got the most bombastic liar ever.

848
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,520
I think we're going to go with the most bombastic liar.

849
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,520
Yeah.

850
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,520
Yeah.

851
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:24,440
I think we're going to really have a whole lot of stability in, um, uh, keeping th keeping

852
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:32,040
people in like unengaged, I guess, engaged, unengaged because you want people actively

853
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,200
consuming your material, but you don't want them engaging with it.

854
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Right.

855
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,040
And having David Knight be like, uh, Steve Pachannik's a fucking liar.

856
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Yeah.

857
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
Then you have to stop.

858
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,320
Why does, why does David Knight think that he's a liar?

859
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Yeah.

860
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,160
And you can't, but why doesn't Alex not?

861
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:54,200
You know, it's too complicated and you run the risk of, uh, uh, kickstarting, like critical

862
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
thinking in your listeners.

863
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,200
And that's no good.

864
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Yeah.

865
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Yeah.

866
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
I can't have that.

867
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Absolutely not.

868
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Stick with Pachannik.

869
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
But it does seem like that was a little bit ago.

870
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
That was a couple of weeks ago.

871
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,040
Like I don't, I don't know if I could draw a causal link here.

872
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,640
And Alex is saying that it's because of money.

873
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
Sure.

874
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:17,120
Now the only things that are gone are the, uh, night show, which obviously sucked the

875
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,180
evening show that no one cared about.

876
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,640
They canceled when Alex went to DC because they didn't have the crew to run it anyway.

877
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,340
That was already like a secondary tertiary thought for them.

878
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:34,840
And then David Knight's show, it very easily could be monetary budget constraints, but

879
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,920
I can also see a possible world where Alex was like, fuck, I got to get rid of David

880
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,920
Knight.

881
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,920
It's just not working out.

882
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,920
This is an untenable situation.

883
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,720
How can we fundraise on that?

884
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,800
How can I drive sales with getting rid of David Knight?

885
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
I don't know.

886
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,080
I can't, I have no fucking idea.

887
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,660
None of it seems good.

888
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,200
Like none of it seems like this is a, no, I wouldn't look at any of these circumstances

889
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,920
and be like, I'm going to invest in this business.

890
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,560
This business's model looks good.

891
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,720
I'm going to wait until it hits rock bottom first, then I might invest in it.

892
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,240
But right now it's only going down.

893
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,560
Well that might be soon.

894
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:17,880
That's unclear because a last clip here from the 17th, Alex kind of implies that the Christmas

895
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,360
sale will determine the future of InfoWars.

896
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:27,640
Just do your Christmas shopping at infoawarsstore.com and we'll expand, but if you don't, we'll contract.

897
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:33,800
And so we're reassessing right now and InfoWars is contracting ahead of a big offensive.

898
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,640
Now I'm going to decide whether it's our big last offensive or just the next of many, but

899
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,960
I promise you this, we'll go out in a fiery inferno of liberty in a peaceful operation

900
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
of total victory.

901
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
Peaceful.

902
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
Peaceful.

903
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Peaceful.

904
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,140
I did say offensive a couple of times there in a fiery blaze of, but it's peaceful.

905
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,140
It's all peaceful.

906
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,140
Don't worry.

907
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:02,320
I would like one last image of InfoWars to be Alex standing in the studio as everything

908
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,160
burns around him with his arms outstretched, his head facing and screaming into the sky.

909
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,960
I think that's how he's got to go out.

910
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,960
Sure.

911
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
Right?

912
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,960
That last image.

913
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,960
I don't want him to actually be burnt alive.

914
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
Like in a movie.

915
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
Yeah.

916
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
Like in a movie.

917
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
It would be a fitting arc.

918
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,520
Like Gary Oldman in The Professional whenever his eyes are all bloodshot and he's screaming

919
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,520
to this guy.

920
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,520
Yeah.

921
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,920
So actually I'm going to play this last clip here from the 17th.

922
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,540
I have one more, but it's just sort of like indicative of like me losing my patience with

923
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:37,040
Alex and why we're going to now jump back to the 16th to see what things were like 24

924
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,440
hours prior to Alex spending the beginning of his show talking about how dire shit is

925
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,540
and David Knight's fired.

926
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:49,300
So I like Andres Manuel Lopez Ormidor.

927
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:54,240
He's a socialist, but he is a real socialist.

928
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,800
And by that, I mean, he's a popular socialist and is actually trying to get higher wages

929
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,400
for people and trying to get corporations to actually not be tax exempt.

930
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,880
I don't agree with that model long term, but so Alex, what the fuck does that mean?

931
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,220
Alex has decided that he likes the president of Mexico because there were some comments

932
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,320
about COVID precautions that Alex enjoyed.

933
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,680
And so now I like him now.

934
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,840
He's a socialist, but he's a real socialist.

935
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
Whatever.

936
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,840
You should hate him more.

937
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
Fuck off.

938
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
You should hate him more.

939
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
That's the thing that you hate most.

940
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,640
You hate people who don't understand socialism, who think that, God, I hate it.

941
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,040
You hate people who you decide are socialists.

942
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
Exactly.

943
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,040
Yeah.

944
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,840
And so we jumped back to the 16th to see like, are there any signs?

945
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,080
Are there any indications that we can get from the 16th that like just a day later?

946
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,000
Hey, everybody, it's December 16th.

947
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I gotta be honest.

948
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,760
We've never had more money than we have right now.

949
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,320
We're just so fucking flush.

950
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,660
Anyways, we'll see how it goes tomorrow.

951
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:56,800
So we start with Alex, the exciting and interesting source.

952
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,160
America and the rest of the world is under globalist, big tech siege, a corporate planetary

953
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,840
takeover to replace humans and to make us obsolete.

954
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:14,280
The Von Mies Institute is highly respected.

955
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,240
With some of the top academics, researchers, economists in the world, they've come out

956
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:28,480
with a big article that's on Infowars.com where they say this is a dystopic, big tech

957
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,040
bio slash digital technocracy.

958
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,240
The Mies Institute is not a super well respected.

959
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,600
They're like hardcore libertarian.

960
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
No, no, no.

961
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,720
We've talked about the Mies Institute in the past and if I recall, my feeling on them was

962
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
they're great.

963
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,240
One of the articles that I covered from their website was a defense of not feeding your

964
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,760
children because you don't have positive responsibilities towards people.

965
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,760
Exactly.

966
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,760
It's like, oh, great.

967
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
Yeah.

968
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
They're also libertarians.

969
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,760
Yeah.

970
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,760
They're also that kind of libertarian that's just a shit head.

971
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,460
Like if you're writing the in defense of not feeding your own kids, you're just a shit

972
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,460
head.

973
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,460
Get out of this Mies Institute bullshit.

974
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,960
You're also not going to not feed your child.

975
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Of course not.

976
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
You're doing this as some kind of a weird mental intellectual masturbation.

977
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,960
Yeah.

978
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,960
It's a shit head thing to do.

979
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,960
Yeah.

980
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Totally.

981
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Totally.

982
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,360
But Alex, not too long ago, was talking about how being a libertarian was the stupidest

983
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,360
thing he's ever done.

984
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,360
The dumbest thing you could do.

985
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
And now he's citing the Mies Institute.

986
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,720
Well, they're great, but they're real libertarians, Dan, and that's the smartest thing you can

987
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
be.

988
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Anyway, Barnes.

989
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,480
His show is canceled now.

990
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Good.

991
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,480
But, Alex-

992
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,480
24 hours earlier-

993
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,560
We have constitutional lawyer, Robert Barnes, who will shoot you straight on where Trump

994
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
really stands.

995
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,280
I can tell you he's in liaison with the White House, even though he doesn't want that known.

996
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,800
I can tell you that.

997
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,200
Why can you tell me that?

998
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,880
Because separately, I know the White House doesn't even care now.

999
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,000
The White House doesn't care.

1000
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
That's why.

1001
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,680
If he doesn't want that known-

1002
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,320
Yeah.

1003
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,720
Why would you tell me that?

1004
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,480
Hey, look, this is private, but Barnes is working with the President.

1005
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,480
He told me not to tell you.

1006
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,480
He doesn't want me to tell you.

1007
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,800
But the White House is- okay, so the White House is finally- but you know Barnes.

1008
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,280
And he personally asked you.

1009
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,560
And now there's no show.

1010
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,660
The Evening Countdown show is canceled.

1011
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:19,200
But there's no indication of that from Alex on the 16th.

1012
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,600
There is no sense that, like, Barnes has been doing this show, it's gonna come to an end.

1013
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
Sure.

1014
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
It seems abrupt.

1015
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
Yeah, it does seem pretty abrupt.

1016
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,960
It seems abrupt.

1017
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,800
Speaking of which, this seemed abrupt.

1018
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,800
But here's the big news we're gonna cover at the start of the next segment.

1019
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,920
Mitch McConnell and his wife, like a lot of Republicans, have been on the Communist Chinese

1020
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,200
payroll for a long time.

1021
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,200
Oh no.

1022
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,200
Sure.

1023
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Sure.

1024
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,640
Let's remember that Mitch McConnell's bad finally.

1025
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,000
It's been so long since we've remembered how many people are bad, Dan.

1026
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,240
Yep, Mitch McConnell has recognized that Biden won the election, and now-

1027
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,000
So it turns out I remember all these things about him.

1028
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,920
Or I'm just gonna make out that he's a Chinese agent.

1029
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,920
Yeah, well.

1030
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,920
Yeah.

1031
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,920
Yeah, so that's great.

1032
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,920
That's great stuff.

1033
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
Now he's a villain.

1034
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,920
I like it.

1035
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,920
Absolutely, Alex.

1036
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,920
McConnell is a villain.

1037
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,920
Go after him!

1038
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,440
So the knives are out, folks, and- Hell yeah!

1039
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,240
There's no doubt that Mitch McConnell is a super bad dude.

1040
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,720
A bad bad- Get him!

1041
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,440
And we told you Amy Cohen, Barrett, and we told you Kavanaugh, and we told you all that

1042
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,040
they were going to betray us.

1043
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,520
What?

1044
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,920
Because they come out of the swamp.

1045
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,920
What?

1046
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
What?

1047
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,920
Yep.

1048
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,400
You told them that the only reason to stick with Trump was so he could get those people

1049
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
in.

1050
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,400
Yeah.

1051
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,400
Why didn't you bring up Gorsuch?

1052
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,040
Also- Oh, Gorsuch is too long ago.

1053
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,320
Alex was like crying- And that one's still stolen.

1054
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,320
About Kavanaugh.

1055
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,680
He was all about Kavanaugh.

1056
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,840
This is the moment we've been waiting for.

1057
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,720
Alex was so in favor of that, as if he was Squee himself.

1058
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,720
This is the culmination of everything we've worked for.

1059
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:59,040
It was a little more confusing, the Barrett nomination, because you did have Barnes coming

1060
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,340
in and saying, this is a really bad idea, they shouldn't go this route, and Alex having

1061
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,960
to dance around, but he did support her nomination.

1062
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,960
Yeah.

1063
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,960
He was in favor of it.

1064
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,960
We like Catholics.

1065
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,960
No, we don't like Catholics.

1066
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,240
Oh, well, I guess we don't like Catholics.

1067
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,000
Somebody else is like, I think she's great, and Alex is like, ah, I think she's great

1068
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
too.

1069
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Moving on.

1070
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But they're all villains now, man.

1071
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Yeah.

1072
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Good.

1073
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
We got a lot of new villains for Alex.

1074
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Love it.

1075
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,960
Fight amongst yourselves, I want to make you hurt each other more.

1076
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:29,400
So Roger Stone, not too long ago, came on and broke some gigantic news.

1077
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,400
Yeah.

1078
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,400
North Korea.

1079
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,400
Yeah.

1080
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,400
Boats.

1081
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,400
Yep.

1082
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Maine.

1083
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
Boats, from North Korea.

1084
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,400
Arrived.

1085
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,400
With ballots.

1086
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,400
Sailed, with ballots, to Maine.

1087
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,400
Arrived in Maine.

1088
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,400
Maine?

1089
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,400
United States, Maine.

1090
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,800
Apparently there's a different situation.

1091
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,640
Oh, did something else happen?

1092
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:51,720
McConnell warns GOP of electoral college brawl in Congress.

1093
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,360
Trump's got his electors.

1094
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,360
They've seated theirs.

1095
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,440
They lock the real electors out of the state houses.

1096
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,400
We're just supposed to just go along with this and not let the president and the voters

1097
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,480
of America press their attacks.

1098
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,680
Yes, they've gotten screwed to legislatures.

1099
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,760
Yes, they've been screwed so far by most of the governors because they're all a bunch

1100
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,760
of cowards.

1101
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,800
But when you get down to the brass tacks, you see mathematics that are impossible in

1102
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,580
all those states where Trump's winning by two, three, four, five, six points.

1103
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:22,800
And then as soon as they, quote, close the polls, all these trucks pull up, food delivery

1104
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
vehicles, you name it.

1105
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,800
Chinese men mainly run in with these big containers of ballots.

1106
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,520
And then inside we have the footage of the workers and they're cramming it in as fast

1107
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,520
as they can.

1108
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,200
And then you have the Chinese government planes landing the day of.

1109
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,200
Wait, what now?

1110
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,200
You have the charter numbers.

1111
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:43,480
I mean, private jets flying out of China, landing men running in with big boxes of ballots.

1112
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:49,000
So now the Chinese government is sending their own planes with charter numbers and arriving

1113
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,120
with ballots on election day.

1114
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,600
So is this an addition to the North Korean boats?

1115
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,600
Okay.

1116
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,960
So is the North Korean boat like a backup?

1117
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,960
Could be.

1118
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:03,720
You know, like they're like, okay, we'll send the boats in like March of this year and China's

1119
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,840
going to have the plan to airlift them in and everything.

1120
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,960
But when, but hey, worst comes to worst, the boats will be in Maine in November.

1121
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,080
Here's what I'm thinking.

1122
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,960
I'm thinking that the Chinese planes brought in ballots, like boxes of ballots for Biden,

1123
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,960
right?

1124
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,960
Okay.

1125
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,920
Now the North Korean boats were rogue.

1126
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,920
They were crazy.

1127
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,920
They were for Jorgensen.

1128
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,920
Jorgensen.

1129
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,920
Okay.

1130
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,920
It's all Jorgensen?

1131
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,920
They were going libertarian.

1132
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,320
Straight libertarian, down ballot.

1133
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:35,560
Are we sure these weren't ballots for the 2016 election and the North Koreans just got

1134
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,560
to Maine?

1135
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,560
That would make more sense.

1136
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,560
Is it all for Ron Johnson?

1137
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,560
Yeah.

1138
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,760
That would make more sense.

1139
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,040
That would make more sense.

1140
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:48,880
So yeah, I just feel like this is silly and I'm going to need a lot more proof of this,

1141
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,760
which Alex is not forthcoming with.

1142
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,760
That's unsurprising.

1143
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,840
But something that is also not surprising.

1144
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,840
What's that?

1145
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,840
Alex wants a do-over.

1146
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:02,360
Second Senator leans towards objecting to Electoral College certification.

1147
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,360
Yes.

1148
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:09,320
Told you Rand Paul's a man of honor.

1149
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,680
That's what we need for president in four years.

1150
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,400
Get the fuck out of here.

1151
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,880
Pence, Paul, Paul, Pence ticket will be good.

1152
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,880
Okay.

1153
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,880
All right.

1154
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,880
Wow.

1155
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,880
Yeah.

1156
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,880
Wow.

1157
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,880
Paul Pence.

1158
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,880
Paul Pence.

1159
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,880
That would really inspire the masses.

1160
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,880
Those two boring ass...

1161
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,880
Those two dim shits.

1162
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,880
Yeah.

1163
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,880
Oh my God.

1164
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,880
Yeah.

1165
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,880
You want Rand Paul back.

1166
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,880
Oh, how fun.

1167
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,880
How interesting.

1168
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,360
Pence can't be president because nobody wants to live in a world where we have to call his

1169
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,880
wife the first mother.

1170
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,120
That's just not happening.

1171
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,120
It's just not happening.

1172
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,640
And Rand Paul, like you had your chance, Alex.

1173
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,320
You turned your back on him for Trump.

1174
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,320
You know that.

1175
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,320
Yep.

1176
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,320
It's over.

1177
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,320
We all watched that happen.

1178
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,320
Oh yeah.

1179
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,000
Rand isn't like Joe Rogan where you can turn your back on him and he'll accept you once

1180
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
more.

1181
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,280
No, I know because he refuses to debate me and that's the only thing that makes sense.

1182
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:04,600
So Robert Barnes, a host for another couple hours of the election countdown is on and

1183
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,600
he wants you to know that he also thinks that Mitch McConnell is a traitor.

1184
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:13,360
So the fact is it leads an inference that well, all along, these were people who were

1185
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:18,440
undermining the president and now it's like the Godfather line when the Marlon Brando's

1186
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,540
character says he should have seen it was that one guy all along.

1187
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:25,740
It was Mitch McConnell all along betraying and undermining and sabotaging the president.

1188
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,740
It's not a coincidence.

1189
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:31,800
It was his attorney general in Kentucky who was the only one to refuse to speak out or

1190
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,540
join the Texas lawsuit.

1191
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,560
So now the president knows that these were traitors in his own house all along.

1192
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,240
Trump's called basically for the arrest of the governor of Georgia.

1193
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,240
I mean these people are criminals.

1194
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,240
We need to get...

1195
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,240
Yeah, I want that too.

1196
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,240
Let's talk about Trump.

1197
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,160
What Trump should do, where Trump's really at, where we're at.

1198
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,960
So Mitch McConnell was screwing it up the whole time.

1199
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,560
He was the, uh, the, uh, the, the traitor behind the scenes.

1200
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,560
Okay.

1201
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,560
All right.

1202
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:00,440
If you want to try and pull that now after this long, after this long, then either you

1203
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,640
have to shut up forever because everything that you've told me, if Mitch McConnell's

1204
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:10,080
the secret bad guy the whole time, he was there, right there, he's there, he's right

1205
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,080
there.

1206
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,080
There's no deep state.

1207
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,080
He was, he's in your face.

1208
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,080
Yeah.

1209
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,080
You know?

1210
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,080
Yeah.

1211
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,240
And it's, um, I don't know.

1212
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:22,480
It's trying too hard to make an interesting plot twist, I think, and I am not going to

1213
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:28,240
go along for this, this ride and I pity, I pity anybody who does, but you see this, like

1214
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:34,840
there are just like shoring up of ranks of like the people who are, uh, blindly willing

1215
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:39,680
to just completely throw away any kind of semblance of dignity that they have for Trump.

1216
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,680
Yeah.

1217
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,680
They're good.

1218
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,680
Yeah.

1219
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,680
Everybody else.

1220
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,680
Oh, they were secretly villains.

1221
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,680
Evil.

1222
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,680
And I have bad news for you.

1223
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,680
What's that?

1224
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,680
That Pence-Paul ticket might not be happening after all.

1225
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,680
Oh no.

1226
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,600
It's not that Pence is truly loyal to Trump during Access Hollywood, Pence was trying

1227
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:58,060
to navigate Trump out so that he could be top of the ticket in 2016.

1228
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,720
It was Pence who helped drive Flynn out.

1229
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:06,680
It was Pence who helped negotiate with Ecuador to get Julian Assange arrested and extradited.

1230
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:11,020
So Pence has not been a real Trump ally in a lot of the never Trumpers and problem people

1231
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:15,080
have come from Pence's group of people and his staff in the white house.

1232
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,400
Oh, it looks like Pence is an enemy too.

1233
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,400
Good.

1234
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,400
Good.

1235
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,400
Yeah.

1236
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,400
They're all enemies.

1237
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:27,240
Arrest the governor of Georgia, veto the defense bill, tear this whole place down around your

1238
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,240
ears.

1239
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,240
No, let's not do that.

1240
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,000
It's just a little much.

1241
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,080
It's a little much.

1242
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:40,080
It's a little cartoonish the way they're like defining good and bad people now.

1243
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:47,320
I think it's, it's really just sad though, because it's, it's like you, you obviously

1244
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,360
weren't actually fooled.

1245
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,760
There's no possible way that you could be fooled by that shit.

1246
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,000
You had to have known that they were lying the whole time and that they didn't really

1247
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,720
like Trump because Trump's a fucking lunatic and they're all career politicians.

1248
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,720
Right.

1249
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,720
Right?

1250
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,720
Yeah.

1251
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,720
But this is the payoff of that.

1252
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:10,320
If you don't know that, then, oh, that's just so sad, especially because I've been telling

1253
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,400
you that for my entire life.

1254
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,440
And it is, it's, it's, it's really interesting for me in particular to see like the, the

1255
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,920
turning on people so bluntly and so stupidly, like Bill Barr was, he went back and forth

1256
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,920
a number of times.

1257
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,920
Oh yeah.

1258
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,000
And now we have Barnes coming in here saying that everyone's an enemy.

1259
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah, yeah.

1260
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,560
Bill Barr was a, Bill Barr was a yo-yo for a while and now he's permanently walking the

1261
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,560
dog.

1262
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,560
Yeah, he's out.

1263
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,560
Yup.

1264
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:42,000
So on the 17th we learned that, that Barnes show is gone.

1265
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
But does Barnes know now?

1266
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:55,800
On the 16th, So on the 16th, he's promoting the show as

1267
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,840
Barnes is back.

1268
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,640
He's been too busy, but now he's back.

1269
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,640
Very funny.

1270
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,640
Next day, gone.

1271
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,640
That's very funny.

1272
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,640
Yeah.

1273
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,640
I think, I think you're right.

1274
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,960
I do kind of feel for David Knight a little bit.

1275
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,840
He's losing his job right before Christmas.

1276
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,840
I get it.

1277
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,880
That's fucking tough.

1278
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,400
I enjoy seeing bad things happen to Robert Barnes in a different way.

1279
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:18,080
And I know that if he doesn't have his fucking moonlighting gig at Infowars, he's going to

1280
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:21,320
be fine scamming other people with fake constitutional lawsuits.

1281
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,680
I think he has, I just enjoy watching him get beat.

1282
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:29,360
I think he has like a newsletter on Dave Rubin's Kickstarter or Patreon clone.

1283
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,360
He's going to land five.

1284
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,400
He's doing all right.

1285
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,340
So Alex says farewell to Barnes, say we'll see you on the evening show that won't exist

1286
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,340
in a day.

1287
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,340
Yes.

1288
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:43,160
And now I must get to another guest and it is a guest that I got the privilege of hanging

1289
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:47,280
out with in DC when I was there yelling and all this shit.

1290
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,280
Oh no.

1291
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,480
Someone who had the best speech.

1292
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,480
Oh no.

1293
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:57,400
Well, there were a lot of powerful messages at the second million manga march.

1294
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,640
This one was about a third as big as the gigantic one.

1295
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,000
It was a month ago.

1296
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,680
There were still hundreds of thousands of people total, five or six different events

1297
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,680
going on.

1298
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,520
And last time I had the most powerful message of, we're not going to back down to the globalist,

1299
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:15,400
the new world order Biden's a chai comm agent, Nick Foyntas had the most powerful message

1300
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,920
at these events.

1301
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,240
The crowds were screaming for, he couldn't even hardly give a speech.

1302
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,240
Yeah.

1303
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,560
So Nick Foyntas had the best, I thought it was going to be for sure.

1304
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,200
It's interesting because I watched hours of these rallies.

1305
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,200
Nick Foyntas did not speak at either of the rallies that I watched.

1306
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,800
He was clearly speaking in some impromptu fashion.

1307
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,080
He was speaking in the beer hall punch?

1308
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,400
Is that what's going on there?

1309
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,600
He was speaking into a bullhorn on the street.

1310
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,600
Something.

1311
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,600
Yeah.

1312
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,600
He was not at these events.

1313
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,880
And there might've been like a third event that I would just don't even know about.

1314
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:49,880
A Klan meeting?

1315
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,440
I only have so much time in my life.

1316
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,240
I can only watch so many of these rallies.

1317
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,240
That is fair.

1318
00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:02,100
Um, so you know, McConnell, Barrett, uh, Kavanaugh, Pence, they're all the enemy now.

1319
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,100
The GOP is the enemy.

1320
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,100
Yeah, of course it is.

1321
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,800
You know, I said Sunday when I had had a chance to see Saturday speeches by Foyntas on my

1322
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,800
Sunday show.

1323
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,800
I said, I think Foyntas is right.

1324
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:16,680
The Republican party, the establishment are the enemies, but we have to make sure that

1325
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,160
doesn't get Democrats elected.

1326
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,600
We have to make sure we target, uh, neo cons and others to get them out and put populace

1327
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,600
in America.

1328
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,600
Ferchers in.

1329
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,640
But now you see McConnell saying, Oh, we need to be nice to Democrats.

1330
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,540
That's how we're going to win Georgia and let them engage in fraud.

1331
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,680
He's definitely working for the other side than a shy comm operative.

1332
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,960
That's not what McConnell's saying.

1333
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,920
He said, he's saying that, uh, you know, insisting on denying reality is probably going to hurt

1334
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,120
our electoral chances.

1335
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:46,840
Hey, you guys, you know how you're screaming that all elections are frauds and that you

1336
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,440
shouldn't vote.

1337
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,640
That's going to hurt us in the elections where we need you to vote.

1338
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,640
Yeah.

1339
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,720
Um, no, you're a Chinese agent.

1340
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,040
Oh, damn it.

1341
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,440
Maybe I've gone too far.

1342
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,480
I'm Mitch McConnell, so I will learn the error of my ways.

1343
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,480
Nope.

1344
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,480
No.

1345
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,760
You will end up having the people that you have inspired and enabled and facilitated

1346
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,280
now screaming at rallies about how we need to destroy you.

1347
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,280
Excellent.

1348
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,560
But first here's one of the eclipse of Nick Foyntez laying out the future and the future

1349
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,160
battle plan at the second big March in DC.

1350
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:25,160
And the first million MAGA March, we promised that if the GOP would not do everything in

1351
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:37,560
their power to keep Trump in office, then we would destroy the GOP for a second million

1352
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,560
MAGA March.

1353
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,560
We're done making promises.

1354
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,560
It has to happen now.

1355
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,560
We are going to destroy the GOP.

1356
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:55,160
There's 50 of us.

1357
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,160
Destroy the GOP!

1358
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,160
Destroy the GOP!

1359
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,160
Destroy the GOP!

1360
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,160
Is there anything you won't chant?

1361
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,160
Destroy the GOP!

1362
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,160
They love chants.

1363
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,160
They fucking chant all the goddamn time.

1364
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,160
It's fun.

1365
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,160
Eh, that's fair.

1366
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,240
Um, so Alex is like, I think he sees that video and he remembers like being in DC and

1367
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,440
he remembers like kind of mad at those women for America first people.

1368
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:16,920
I don't like how they organize these rallies and then don't let me speak at them because

1369
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,040
I'm entitled to.

1370
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,440
This is a parallel or an allegory or like a gauge on a submarine or a battleship or

1371
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,160
an army tanker, a truck.

1372
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,320
You have these women that are neo cons and I'm not going to attack them, but the point

1373
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,480
is they get all the permits, they take control of the thing.

1374
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,320
And then when you hear the speakers they've got, it is just people are falling asleep

1375
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:40,880
and then I show up with a bullhorn and Nick shows up and you get, you know, out of the

1376
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,560
a hundred thousand people, 20,000 that here you run over and they're all cheering.

1377
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,380
And then it gets 5 million, 10 million views.

1378
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:52,500
And then the poor Republicans with kind of a mainline rhino, a little Trump type deal,

1379
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,820
they get 20,000 views.

1380
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:54,960
It's not popular.

1381
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,960
It's not constitutional.

1382
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:01,380
It's not what made America, but everyone's always running away from what victory is.

1383
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,920
So Alex, I don't think is wrong.

1384
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,800
I mean, he's exaggerating stuff, but like, yeah, a lot of those other speakers were a

1385
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,800
snooze and Alex yelling has some kind of star quality to him.

1386
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,800
He gets people to chant.

1387
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:17,360
But he's also sort of misunderstanding, like spectacle for substance.

1388
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,360
Yeah.

1389
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:23,360
Like I don't think that there's anything like him being able to draw a crowd of 10,000,

1390
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,160
let's say, isn't an indication that he knows the constitution.

1391
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:31,240
I don't think there's a difference for him between substance and spectacle.

1392
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:35,280
You know, it's not that he understands or misunderstands it or it's just that it doesn't

1393
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,280
exist to him.

1394
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,280
Yeah.

1395
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,160
You know, like 5 million views means 500 million people love this, right?

1396
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,160
That's how it works.

1397
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,160
Yeah.

1398
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,160
That's the only thing that makes sense.

1399
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,560
Also, I'd like to clarify one thing.

1400
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,980
These people starting these rallies and organizing them and getting the permits does mean that

1401
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,120
they can choose who speaks at it and who doesn't.

1402
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,920
Well, I feel like I'm missing the part where he's going to say like, so next time we're

1403
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,440
going to get the permit.

1404
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,440
No.

1405
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,440
He's not going to say that?

1406
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,440
No.

1407
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,520
Well see, cause it feels like that's the real complaint here.

1408
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,320
And he's just whining that he's not the winner.

1409
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,400
He's too busy with all the work.

1410
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,560
He is not.

1411
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,680
Psychic trances take a while.

1412
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,680
You know what?

1413
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,680
I know somebody who just lost his job and is free.

1414
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,660
I don't think he's going to fill those shoes.

1415
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:26,320
So Nick Fuentes has an interesting idea for the way forward for these weirdo conservatives.

1416
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,320
You know, it's interesting.

1417
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,820
There were a lot of Democrats that were saying, destroy the GOP.

1418
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,360
This is a message I could get behind.

1419
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,640
But of course, that's only the first half of the message.

1420
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,680
Destroy the GOP as it exists.

1421
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,520
Destroy the GOP establishment.

1422
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:44,000
And what we have to do now is replace it with a GOP that truly represents the American people.

1423
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,920
We have to destroy the fake GOP establishment headed by Mitch McConnell that puts America

1424
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,920
last.

1425
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,040
We have to primary all those people, replace them in the House, in the Senate and the state

1426
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,040
governments.

1427
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,560
And we have to replace them with people that truly believe in America first, truly believe

1428
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:04,920
in the kind of conservatism that President Trump pushed when he ran in 2016.

1429
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,720
Look, Nick Fuentes is like 14 years old.

1430
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,160
So I'm going to forgive him for not remembering that they did this already.

1431
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,440
Yeah, it was called the Tea Party.

1432
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:18,240
This is the crazier version that you guys wanted last time.

1433
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,040
Yeah, this already happened.

1434
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,880
We're in another cycle of this, like, oh, it's not the real whatever.

1435
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,880
Who cares?

1436
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,960
I'm going to forgive that.

1437
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,900
What I'm not going to forgive is the fact that he doesn't remember they did that this

1438
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:30,900
year.

1439
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,900
Yes, they did do that this year as well.

1440
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,320
Laura Loeber was running.

1441
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,320
All these other people.

1442
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,240
Enrique Tarrio was going to run.

1443
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:42,120
Everybody lost their fucking primaries because the people that you end up attracting are

1444
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,400
not not no, no, no.

1445
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,520
It's just because it's just because the GOP people in the primary thought they were voting

1446
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,760
for a GOP candidate because they've been in there for a while, but they were actually

1447
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,560
voting for a traitor.

1448
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,560
Right.

1449
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,560
Okay.

1450
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,560
Got to go.

1451
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,560
There we go.

1452
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,560
No, I think we should all be screaming.

1453
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,560
I apologize.

1454
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,640
I believe Loomer did win her primary.

1455
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,640
That's true.

1456
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,480
That is, she lost in the general, but a lot of those other folks lost in primaries.

1457
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,480
Yeah.

1458
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,480
No, I think we should all be...

1459
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,880
And did the wars employ Deanna Lorraine?

1460
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,120
Yes, she might have won.

1461
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,520
She did.

1462
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:20,080
I think we should all be screaming at establishment Republicans that the only way the GOP survives

1463
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,160
is if they all band together and crush the extreme right wing, and I think we tell the

1464
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:28,300
extreme right wing that the only way the GOP survives is if they band together and crush

1465
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,960
the establishment Republicans.

1466
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,400
I get the sense that at least half of that's going to happen on its own.

1467
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,400
That's probably true.

1468
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,560
That's why we got to make sure both happens, because if one half happens, we're going to

1469
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,240
get to the Tea Party and then double it.

1470
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,240
Yeah.

1471
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:50,640
I don't know if that's avoidable, but interestingly, Nick Fuentes and Alex have slightly different

1472
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,480
strategies about what they should do in Georgia.

1473
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:59,560
I'm of the belief that the first blow that we have to strike against the Republican Party

1474
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:03,920
is withholding our votes in Georgia, withholding our votes in the Senate runoff and preventing

1475
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,880
them from reclaiming control of the Senate.

1476
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,880
Now that's where I may disagree with you.

1477
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:08,880
Do it.

1478
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,880
Do it.

1479
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:10,880
Do it.

1480
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,880
Do it.

1481
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:12,880
Do it.

1482
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,880
Do it.

1483
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,880
Do it.

1484
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,880
Do it.

1485
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,880
Do it.

1486
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,880
Alex is not into that.

1487
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,880
He's like, nah, I don't know about that.

1488
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,800
He's primarily some Republican, you know, with a crazy person.

1489
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,800
Yeah.

1490
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,800
Great.

1491
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,800
I'm all for that.

1492
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,800
Yeah.

1493
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,720
But torpedoing the election and letting a Democrat win, I don't know.

1494
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:36,360
Whereas Nick Fuentes is, we need to punish the Republican Party, withhold our votes.

1495
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:43,280
He's very much like accelerationist towards this thing, and Alex is more like, I don't

1496
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,280
know.

1497
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,280
These people disgust me.

1498
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,280
Yes.

1499
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:53,360
And I'm like, wait up, how fucking cruel are you to me to be like, we're gonna kill everybody

1500
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:58,280
with Trump as the king of God and the good Lord and Jesus Christ.

1501
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,660
And after losing the election, what we need to do is we need to focus on small elections

1502
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,280
and we need to primary the Republican.

1503
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,280
Fuck you.

1504
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,280
Yeah.

1505
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,200
The Lord chose Trump, but the Lord also needs primaries from time to time.

1506
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,200
Fuck off.

1507
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:17,440
But the, what the Satan made God forget was county seats.

1508
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,440
Yeah.

1509
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,440
What?

1510
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,440
What are we doing?

1511
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,440
Yeah.

1512
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,560
So Nick has an interesting angle on QAnon.

1513
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,660
What I like about the QAnon stuff is that it gets a lot of people to believe the right

1514
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:32,640
things, although it gets them to believe the right things for the wrong reasons.

1515
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,200
It gets them to start thinking about connections between global special interests.

1516
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,760
It gets them to ask the right questions about pedophiles and satanic elites and things like

1517
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:45,040
that, largely for the wrong reasons, but it does get them to some of the right places.

1518
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:51,600
I do appreciate the hubris of all of these idiots who are like, you know what?

1519
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:57,400
What we need to do is get the swirling masses to believe something similar to what I believe

1520
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,800
and then I'll be able to control it.

1521
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,240
It doesn't quite work that way usually.

1522
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,240
No, it doesn't.

1523
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,240
No.

1524
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,240
Sorry Fuentes.

1525
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:10,720
But I will say again, I'm going to give Nick a pass on this because he is a wee baby, but

1526
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:15,800
he seems to be patting himself on the back a little bit for discovering the concept of

1527
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,800
local politics.

1528
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,800
Of course.

1529
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,280
You know, Trump launched this hostile takeover of the top of the party, I mean literally

1530
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:26,400
becoming the president, and now we have to wage a war for everything beneath the presidency.

1531
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,280
We have to wage a war to primary, House Republicans, Senate Republicans.

1532
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,260
We have to run in state races and local races.

1533
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:36,200
We have to take over the RNC and the party apparatus.

1534
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,200
So I'm actually more energized.

1535
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,160
General Fuentes, I've not heard it better said.

1536
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,680
That was perfectly said.

1537
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,760
It's so trite.

1538
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:50,480
I have in 2018, I have in 2016, I have in 2014, I have in 2012.

1539
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,600
This is not revolutionary stuff.

1540
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,780
This is very bland.

1541
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:58,200
And that's kind of one of the things that I think is interesting and a little bit scary

1542
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:04,080
about Nick is that beneath this there's also an obsession with the idea of fighting against

1543
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:12,700
amnesty and identity and America, like all this stuff, but it is also like, okay, yeah,

1544
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:18,120
you're talking about running for a local election.

1545
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:23,520
You're running for the school president or whatever.

1546
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:29,240
That's the banality, the minutia, the boringness of it with the evilness hidden behind it is

1547
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,240
kind of scary.

1548
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:36,640
Oh, Biden is stealing the election and he's killing all of us with the fucking globalists.

1549
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:41,360
And that is why I'm going to vote no on the expansion of that road.

1550
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,960
Route six stays the same length.

1551
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,960
Yeah.

1552
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,960
So Nick, Nick's out of there.

1553
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,840
Uh, in and out, in and out.

1554
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,840
Got to destroy the GOP.

1555
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,840
Got it.

1556
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,480
Um, now we're going to play a new game on this show.

1557
01:03:52,480 --> 01:04:00,200
Uh, I'm going to play, uh, an angry clip from Alex Jones without who it's targeted at.

1558
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,200
Okay.

1559
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,480
And you have to guess who is he yelling about?

1560
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,480
Okay.

1561
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,480
I like this game.

1562
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:11,080
Uh, this is called guess who Alex is telling to burn in hell, burn in hell, you little

1563
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:16,920
Satanist on a power trip about how great you are and how amazing you are and how, how ascended

1564
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,240
you are as you bring in global collapse and extermination burn in hell.

1565
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,240
Who is Alex?

1566
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,720
No, no, no, no, no.

1567
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,720
It's little.

1568
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:29,320
I thought the little, you can ask me, I can ask you two questions.

1569
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,320
Two questions.

1570
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,320
All right.

1571
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,320
Rich or no?

1572
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,320
Very.

1573
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,320
Very rich.

1574
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,320
Very rich.

1575
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,320
Obscenely rich.

1576
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,320
I don't know if I want to say obscenely, but quite rich.

1577
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,320
Quite rich.

1578
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,320
Yes.

1579
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,320
All right.

1580
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,320
I'm going to give you five questions.

1581
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,740
I wish I had, I wish I had asked a more specific question because very rich is a, is a more

1582
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:45,920
subjective question that I think I want.

1583
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,920
Super rich.

1584
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,920
Billion or higher?

1585
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,920
Probably.

1586
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:49,920
I don't know.

1587
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,440
I, I have a really hard time.

1588
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:57,880
So not one of our major, it's not Soros, it's not Spiros, it's not that, oh.

1589
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:58,880
Out of five.

1590
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,880
Out of five.

1591
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:05,160
Um, have we mocked his or her appearance?

1592
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,160
No.

1593
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,160
What?

1594
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,520
No, no, no.

1595
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,520
Not us.

1596
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,520
Oh.

1597
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,520
I meant Alex.

1598
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,520
I don't know why I'm saying we.

1599
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,520
No.

1600
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,520
Alex hasn't mocked their appearance?

1601
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,520
I don't think so.

1602
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,520
Well then it's definitely not Stelter.

1603
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,760
I'm not sure I've heard Alex bring this person up before.

1604
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,760
Well this is unfair.

1605
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,760
Yup.

1606
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,760
Little person who thinks there's a AOC.

1607
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,760
I'm going to go with AOC.

1608
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,120
He brings her up all the time.

1609
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,120
Oh shit, that's right.

1610
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,120
That's four.

1611
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,120
What was I thinking?

1612
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,120
God damn it.

1613
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,120
What was I thinking?

1614
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,760
You have all the pieces you need.

1615
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,760
Ugh.

1616
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,760
Um.

1617
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,000
Bezos' wife.

1618
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
No.

1619
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Oh, okay.

1620
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Tom Cruise.

1621
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,960
Oh, because of the clip of him yelling about COVID, god damn it.

1622
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:54,360
Oh, Dan, you threw, you played the player.

1623
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:55,360
Well done.

1624
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,360
That's why we play the game.

1625
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,080
That's a good one to open with, yeah.

1626
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:06,560
So, um, Nick Fuentes is gone, Barnes has come on, there's no indication of anything, trouble

1627
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:11,360
in paradise as it were, and I get a little bit bored, honestly, listening to this episode

1628
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:16,600
now, because like, listen to this, this is 30 seconds, this is what Alex thinks has substance

1629
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,600
to it.

1630
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,880
This is what he thinks his job is.

1631
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:26,920
Pompeo tests negative for COVID-19, will quarantine, oh my gosh, oh it's so scary, even though

1632
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:32,360
it has a death rate of like 0.00 or whatever, it's all just an excuse for Tom Cruise and

1633
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:36,800
Nancy Pelosi to just act arrogant and scream at people and do whatever they want.

1634
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:40,920
Over the counter home test for COVID-19, it's US Green Line, so we can have more hysteria,

1635
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:47,400
more fear, Kansas mayor resigns over violent threats for backing mask mandate, I don't

1636
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,740
feel safe anymore, we'll move to North Korea, you witch.

1637
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:52,740
That's it?

1638
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:55,200
Like this is the substance of his news breakdown.

1639
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:02,400
Like it's kind of like a dishy insult after reading the headline, it's like what is this?

1640
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,400
This is bad.

1641
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,280
And also, Cruise didn't need that shit.

1642
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,860
He gets to act like he owns everything and runs the place because he's the figurehead

1643
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:10,860
of a religion.

1644
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:15,480
I also find it strange that Alex isn't taking issue with the Scientology aspect.

1645
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,480
No, no problem there.

1646
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,480
No.

1647
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,640
Well, that makes perfect sense though.

1648
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:25,520
So Alex has been dealing with Hayden, General Hayden, saying on Twitter that he agreed with

1649
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:30,360
someone else who tweeted that Alex should be arrested and Alex is pumped.

1650
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,360
Of course he is.

1651
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:40,840
Well, yesterday, I was getting more emails and more calls about CNN and all these publications

1652
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,560
saying Alex Jones may be arrested.

1653
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:48,760
On Saturday, there were a lot of publications that said, and I gave a speech in DC, did

1654
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,480
Jones threaten to kill Biden?

1655
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:55,600
And then by Sunday, calls for Jones to be arrested for threatening to kill Joe Biden.

1656
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:59,920
And then by Monday, Alex Jones to be arrested for threatening to kill Joe Biden.

1657
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,360
That's how the media works, how they're gaslighting and fraud works.

1658
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:04,880
Alex is so excited about this.

1659
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,480
Yeah, that's got to give him a huge boner, totally.

1660
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:13,400
Michael Hayden is paying attention to him in a way that he probably would never...

1661
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,680
I got months out of, yeah.

1662
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,960
So now Alex is going to imply that maybe Michael Hayden's a pedophile.

1663
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,920
I mean, this is a stolen valor monster.

1664
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:27,240
He also is involved with some very mysterious international orphanages and transfer of children.

1665
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,320
I can tell you that's being looked into already.

1666
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:33,000
I got contacted by some folks, I'll just leave it at that.

1667
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,600
And that's why I said he looks like a child molester.

1668
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:39,280
I'm not saying he's a child molester, I'm just saying Brian Stelter looks about as creepy

1669
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,280
as you'd get.

1670
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,280
You're not going to want any babysitting kids.

1671
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,360
But Hayden's own Twitter photo is the creepiest photo of him.

1672
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,280
Please pull up Michael T. Hayden's Twitter photo, I just want to show people.

1673
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:50,760
He's like in a Steelers cap on a mountain top.

1674
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,720
It's not that creepy.

1675
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,720
Sometimes I'm just not sure if things are real.

1676
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,720
No.

1677
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,720
It's very weird.

1678
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:01,000
I was listening to that in my head, just part of this being like, is this real?

1679
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Am I dreaming?

1680
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
What's happening?

1681
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
What's going on?

1682
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
It's pretty strange.

1683
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,560
It's like, ah, this guy has tweeted something I dislike.

1684
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,200
I am going to accuse him of stealing children from an orphanage.

1685
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,200
Yeah.

1686
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,560
Because he looks creepy to me.

1687
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:14,560
Yeah.

1688
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,560
It's very weird.

1689
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,800
But Alex has a gotcha.

1690
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:21,480
And he got this gotcha from, I don't know, I guess Harrison Smith probably, someone who

1691
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:27,640
works at Infowars, scrolled through Hayden's Twitter timeline and found some things to

1692
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,640
get upset about.

1693
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,400
These guys are great researchers.

1694
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:36,040
He put out a bunch of tweets saying pro-life about Trump, thank you Amy Covid Barrett for

1695
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,840
groundbreaking decision.

1696
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:45,800
So what this is, is he had tweeted a picture of like graves and it was from another account.

1697
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:49,960
He had retweeted it with a quote tweet saying pro-life question mark.

1698
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:50,960
Right.

1699
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,960
So that's the first tweet.

1700
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,960
Sure.

1701
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:53,960
Sure, sure, sure.

1702
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:59,240
And then they put out, it's a joke account, an image of a mass grave implying that Trump's

1703
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:03,560
killing everybody because the Supreme Court ruled churches could be opened.

1704
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,020
That's unconstitutional to close them.

1705
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:11,800
But then literally days later, this is November 26th, go to his Twitter and show people this

1706
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,800
guys.

1707
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,880
He puts out a Pittsburgh Steelers.

1708
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,600
That's November 26th.

1709
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:23,800
On November 27th, he tweets, let's do some football, Pittsburgh proud, happy birthday,

1710
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:28,080
no social distancing, NFL game.

1711
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,120
Now folks, again, imagine the irony of this.

1712
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,680
He's saying Trump is mass graving people.

1713
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:39,240
Trump is murdering people because a Baptist or Catholic church or Buddhist temple or mosque

1714
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,480
can be opened with 10 people, a thousand, whatever.

1715
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,720
Walmart can be opened.

1716
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,080
Target can be opened.

1717
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,480
Disneyland can be opened, but your churches can't.

1718
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,160
Liquor stores are open.

1719
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,840
All this is going on, but he's a big Pittsburgh Steelers fan.

1720
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,400
They actually work with Pittsburgh Steelers.

1721
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,800
I'm, I'm, oh, I'm stalking you Hayden.

1722
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,960
Open source, baby.

1723
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,280
Open source, baby.

1724
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,280
Wow.

1725
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:06,760
So that gif that he tweeted was from last season in the football, back when there were

1726
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:13,000
huge crowds for sporting events, it's just a gif of Steelers fans putting their towels

1727
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
in the air.

1728
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Great.

1729
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Yeah.

1730
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
It's not a gotcha.

1731
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,960
It's not a, no, it's, it's a, it's an old picture.

1732
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,800
Now, the only thing sadder than reading those tweets is scrolling through his timeline to

1733
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,000
find those tweets.

1734
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Yeah.

1735
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,400
And then Alex thinking that this is like an own.

1736
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,400
Yeah.

1737
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,400
I gotcha.

1738
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,400
I gotcha Hayden.

1739
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,400
Open source, baby.

1740
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,400
Yeah.

1741
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,400
That's, that's not good.

1742
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,400
Log off the internet.

1743
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,400
Get off the internet.

1744
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:39,880
I mean, when you read, when you read too much about tweets, you know, you, you can read

1745
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,640
everybody, reading one tweet is too many tweets, but when you read about tweets, now we're

1746
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,960
in real, get off the internet.

1747
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,880
That's what a whole lot of like national file articles are about.

1748
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,400
They're just about someone's tweets.

1749
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,600
So fucking crazy.

1750
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,600
Yeah.

1751
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,600
It seems trivial.

1752
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,600
Yeah.

1753
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,160
So I was getting a little bit like, I don't know.

1754
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,240
I feel untethered.

1755
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:57,640
I don't know what's going on here.

1756
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:02,760
I, you know, I feel like it's really important that, uh, Alex is downsizing.

1757
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,040
Well I've got bad news for you.

1758
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,040
Effective immediately, Dan.

1759
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,040
Oh no.

1760
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,040
You are fired.

1761
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,040
That's all right.

1762
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,040
Sorry.

1763
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,120
Uh, I doesn't feel like at all, like anything's going on here on the 16th.

1764
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,560
It seems very much just business as usual.

1765
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,560
Right.

1766
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,760
And it kind of was boring me.

1767
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:17,760
Yeah.

1768
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,080
It's just Nick Fuentes has a great idea to destroy the GOP, but also I don't want to

1769
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:24,600
do what Nick Fuentes has suggested in order to destroy the GOP.

1770
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,600
Yeah.

1771
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,600
Yeah.

1772
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,600
I don't like that.

1773
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,600
I don't like that.

1774
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:32,000
Um, and I just kind of like, I don't know.

1775
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,800
And then Patrick, I can't remember his last name.

1776
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,800
It'll come to me later.

1777
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,800
Dempsey.

1778
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:41,920
No, he's the guy who's the overstock CEO who was dating that Russian spy.

1779
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:42,920
Oh yeah.

1780
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:43,920
Yeah.

1781
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,920
Yeah.

1782
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:45,920
Yeah.

1783
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,920
Marina Abramovich.

1784
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:47,920
Bettina.

1785
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,920
Bettina.

1786
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:49,920
That's right.

1787
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,920
Yeah.

1788
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:51,920
Yeah.

1789
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,920
He's back and he has an interesting story to tell.

1790
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:57,600
He and the MyPillow guy should have a tag team wrestling team, like something.

1791
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,400
I didn't bring this up.

1792
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:04,160
This guy, Patrick, the overstock CEO introduced Michael Flynn at the rally.

1793
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,160
Of course he did.

1794
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,160
Yeah.

1795
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,420
Why wouldn't I, why wouldn't I know that?

1796
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,640
Why wouldn't I just agree with that?

1797
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,840
I didn't bring that up on the show cause his speech was kind of like, I don't care.

1798
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:12,840
Of course.

1799
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:18,560
But he is back with Alex and man, he has got a big old story to tell.

1800
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,560
I believe your story.

1801
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,680
I know there were a lot of stings on Hillary.

1802
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,960
She was very arrogant.

1803
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,720
She was taking over what, $2 billion from different governments, individuals, anybody

1804
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,920
that would give her money, she'd give them access.

1805
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:32,840
That's what the email server shows out of the Southern district has been investigating

1806
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,840
her.

1807
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,840
I know they've been investigating Hunter.

1808
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:38,220
When you came out and said this, and I saw the video yesterday, I said, that's the same

1809
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:42,280
stuff I got told that there were successful stings on Hillary, but then when they thought

1810
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:46,960
she was going to win, that all got scrubbed and that the justice department has all that

1811
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,280
info has been protecting her.

1812
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,520
So thanks for joining us.

1813
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,040
We've got the floor here to give us the latest.

1814
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:59,000
So Alex has played a clip of Patrick from another show and he's telling this story that

1815
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,880
he got approached by the FBI to facilitate a sting operation on Hillary Clinton.

1816
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,600
And then eventually they're like, yeah, we're not going to do anything.

1817
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:12,440
We got her, you know, giving up, taking a bribe from a foreign country, but we're not

1818
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,920
going to do anything about it.

1819
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,480
And then Patrick didn't say anything about it until four years or whatever.

1820
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,080
So he seems credible.

1821
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,080
That sounds right.

1822
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,080
Yeah.

1823
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,080
I wondered as you were playing that, why have me on?

1824
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,080
You just play.

1825
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,160
I told the story in another show, but I'll give you some more detail.

1826
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,160
This is true.

1827
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,600
By the way, I'm in an incredibly precarious situation.

1828
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,560
Well, I've already, no, I want you to want to know why you did it.

1829
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,560
I have a good idea.

1830
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,560
The country's in trouble.

1831
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,320
It's time for us all to give our maximum.

1832
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,320
Yeah.

1833
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,320
I mean, the hell with it.

1834
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:43,720
I I've, I've been getting myself an ulcer for two years wanting to come out, but being told

1835
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,560
trust the process, trust the process, trust the process.

1836
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:54,080
I, about a year ago, there was a conversation or communication between myself and the powers

1837
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:58,080
that be that said, I'm not comfortable being part of a coverup.

1838
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:02,680
And they said, you're, you wait until after the election, after the election, you can

1839
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,200
say whatever the hell you want to say, tell the whole story.

1840
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:10,640
So I waited to the election and I couldn't live with myself if I'm not coming out about

1841
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,640
it now.

1842
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,640
So he's got it.

1843
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,720
He's got to tell his story now because the election's over.

1844
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,480
He's free to, uh, to tell it all.

1845
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,680
Throw tomatoes at this man.

1846
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:25,560
So tomatoes at this man, he, in 2015, December, 2015, coming up on five years, right?

1847
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,100
He was approached, approached by the FBI, of course.

1848
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:33,040
And they said in December of 2015, we need you.

1849
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,040
This is word for word.

1850
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,480
I have something called an eidetic memory.

1851
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,960
When I tell you something's word for word, it's word for word.

1852
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:47,000
They came back and said, this part of the FBI is asking for your help again, the there.

1853
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,680
There are two groups investigating the FBI in the FBI, investigating Hillary Clinton,

1854
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,680
Patrick.

1855
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,240
One is the email group.

1856
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:58,320
And we know that's a whitewash, but there's a group in New York who really wants to put

1857
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,240
her ass in stir.

1858
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:03,320
They're going after financials, the Clinton financials.

1859
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:09,320
Comey has been blocking them, uh, from acting saying there wasn't enough to justify them

1860
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:12,680
going aggressive in their investigative techniques.

1861
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:19,500
I don't know if, uh, it, it should be seen as like normal that an investigation starts

1862
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,560
with wanting to incarcerate somebody.

1863
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,560
Yeah.

1864
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,560
That's probably not good.

1865
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,840
It seems like that's a tainted investigation.

1866
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:31,000
It's almost like one that wouldn't really hold up upon, uh, and it seems like if any

1867
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,960
of this is true, which I don't think any of it is, uh, Comey might have been coming from

1868
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:39,640
a position of there's no reason to engage in an investigation like this.

1869
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:44,320
It could be a cover up or it could also be, you guys are telling me that you want to talk

1870
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:49,200
to the CEO of overstock.com to try and sting Hillary Clinton.

1871
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:50,760
Guess who doesn't get to do that?

1872
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,180
You guys go away now.

1873
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:54,880
Can I show all of my cards?

1874
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,680
Sure.

1875
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:59,040
I don't believe any of this.

1876
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,360
I will, I will say this.

1877
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,680
I believe the CEO is making this shit up.

1878
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:03,680
Right off the bat.

1879
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:09,000
The only thing idetic about this guy's memory is that he was able to able to remember the

1880
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
word idetic.

1881
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
He did memorize that.

1882
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,200
That is bullshit.

1883
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,440
So here's the deal.

1884
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:18,140
Turkey has already bribed Hillary Clinton, uh, for $20 million.

1885
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,140
Well, sure.

1886
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:22,600
So now we just need to get Patrick to facilitate another bribe.

1887
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:23,600
Okay.

1888
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,420
So they were saying that Comey had been saying up to that point, there was not enough predicate

1889
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:30,200
information to justify a sting.

1890
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:35,040
However, Patrick, they told me information has come in and Hillary's accepted a bribe.

1891
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:41,600
She took a $20 million bribe from Turkey and that information has come in and the group

1892
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:48,480
in New York has now used that as leverage to force Comey to sign off on a sting and

1893
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:52,820
he has approved a sting and the New York group is sending to you for you to help and you're

1894
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:54,520
going to facilitate a bribe.

1895
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:59,440
And there's another government that was known to want to bribe Hillary.

1896
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,440
It's an idetic memory.

1897
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,240
You're going to befriend that government.

1898
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:06,480
You're going to befriend the bag man in that government and somewhere, and it's going to

1899
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:11,280
happen in the next two months, Patrick, somewhere, there's going to be a room and Hillary Clinton

1900
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,280
walks into that room.

1901
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,280
There's going to be a room.

1902
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,280
It's very formulaic.

1903
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:19,160
Well, it was a very specific thing.

1904
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:22,360
They told me that there's going to be a room she's going to come in for 10 minutes.

1905
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,000
The bag man is going to be in for 10 minutes.

1906
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,640
They're going to be there alone.

1907
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,640
And that's it.

1908
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,640
That's your assignment.

1909
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:32,840
He's got to find, he's got to befriend this government, some unnamed other government

1910
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:39,420
and insinuate himself in such a way that he can be a go-between between the bag man and

1911
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:44,960
Hillary Clinton to get this, by the way.

1912
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:49,520
I'm just going to throw this out there as like a huge question for this story.

1913
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:54,560
I'm just going to go out and say, why did they come to him?

1914
01:18:54,560 --> 01:19:00,720
Does he have experience cozying up to governments or in any sort of like, he did date that Russian

1915
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,720
spy.

1916
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:06,640
I think that might be a bigger red flag here.

1917
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,880
He started overstock.

1918
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:09,880
Yeah.

1919
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:10,880
Yeah.

1920
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,880
Okay.

1921
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,880
So yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't buy any of this.

1922
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:17,360
It's so complicated and I can't, I just can't imagine any of this.

1923
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:23,120
We know you're dating a compromised agent of a foreign government.

1924
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,160
I don't know the timeline on that.

1925
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,160
I don't know the timeline on that.

1926
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,640
It might've been at a different point in his life.

1927
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:34,160
That said, this is also a sting on that bag man because that other government isn't going,

1928
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,000
they think that this is a real, no, no, no.

1929
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,040
They're going along with the whole, no, the whole sting is planned.

1930
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,360
The bag man is not in on it.

1931
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:44,300
So now the foreign government is trying to entrap Hillary Clinton along with the help

1932
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,300
of the FBI?

1933
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,300
Probably.

1934
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,300
I don't think so.

1935
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,720
I think the only people that aren't interested is Turkey.

1936
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,720
They want their money back.

1937
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:50,720
I guess that's it.

1938
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:53,320
Give me the overstock guy.

1939
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:58,000
So look, I think that Patrick had a really reasonable response to this and it's that,

1940
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,840
Hey man, if I do this, I'm going to commit crimes.

1941
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,200
You better not arrest me for those crimes I commit in order to set this up.

1942
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,520
I need immunity.

1943
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:11,640
This sounds like somebody writing a much better movie where they didn't commit all the crimes

1944
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,640
that they did.

1945
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,560
Instead they were not crimes.

1946
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,080
This is, this is the clip where it really turned for me too.

1947
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:22,340
From a like, ah, story to a ooh.

1948
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:26,040
They gave me that and it was up to me how to create that event.

1949
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,040
So it's all up to me.

1950
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,920
And I told them, look, to make that happen, there's going to be some bribing and stuff.

1951
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:35,520
And I need a, I need something called an acts otherwise illegal letter, which is a letter

1952
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,480
they can give you when they're asking you to do something like this, like get involved

1953
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:41,000
in a federal election and bribe someone.

1954
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,120
And they went back and I see the time I'll finish this in 45 seconds and then we'll continue

1955
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,120
the story.

1956
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,120
I'll finish this part.

1957
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,480
And they, they said, we'll have to go back to the office and discuss it.

1958
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:53,720
They came back in two days and said, word for word now, we've been told to tell you

1959
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:57,960
we can't give you a letter, but if you'll come to DC, the director says you can be shown

1960
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:58,960
a letter.

1961
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,280
And I said, oh, this is coming from director Comey.

1962
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:08,480
And two federal agents looked me in the eye and said, and, and I said, oh, this is coming

1963
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,880
from director Comey and the president.

1964
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:16,880
And two federal agents looked me in the eye and said, and I said, well, you can tell director

1965
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,800
Comey and president Obama that from them is good enough for me.

1966
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,800
Consider Hillary bride.

1967
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:22,800
Come back.

1968
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:23,800
You'll be right back.

1969
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:24,800
Oh, so it's Obama's right.

1970
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,520
If this one is just so big, we know the Obamas and the Clintons don't like each other.

1971
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,520
Stay with us.

1972
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,520
Holy shit.

1973
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:31,520
Okay.

1974
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,520
Holy shit.

1975
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,520
Okay.

1976
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,520
Okay.

1977
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,520
So this is, wow.

1978
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,520
This is 2015.

1979
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:37,520
Wow.

1980
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,520
Obama is like, it's time to take Hill down.

1981
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,520
It's time to take her down.

1982
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,240
I had her as secretary of state for long enough and now we just got to get rid of her.

1983
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:50,360
Well, it starts to make sense when they come back from break and they lay out more of what

1984
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,860
the conspiracy is here.

1985
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:57,520
But yes, it is a little bit hard to put your head around like, ah, yes, Obama is trying

1986
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,520
to sting Hillary.

1987
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:02,780
Also, also stop, stop me real quick.

1988
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:04,840
If I, cause I could be wrong.

1989
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:12,500
Is it regular practice for the FBI to clandestinely come to you and say, we need you to sting

1990
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:18,880
the most famous woman in the world.

1991
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,880
And let me tell you this, we've got no ideas.

1992
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,080
Go for it, buddy.

1993
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:27,160
However you think you can make this sting happen.

1994
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,920
We're not even giving you help.

1995
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:35,400
You're basically MacGyver and look, you know what to do.

1996
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:39,520
Look, we, we here at the FBI don't like to micromanage.

1997
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,520
Yes.

1998
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:55,560
Comey said, Comey said, do your thing, Obama famously lacks secret super spy guy from Overstock.

1999
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,800
Sell me on this story more, give me more.

2000
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,720
I'm imagining this guy just like coming in from the ceiling on wires.

2001
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,440
That's my only image of spy work.

2002
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,440
Yeah, basically.

2003
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:05,440
Yeah.

2004
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:09,440
Um, so Patrick, they come back from break and he says something really interesting that

2005
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:15,160
makes me think like, Oh, he might know more about Alex than he's letting on.

2006
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:19,120
When all, when the dust settles, everyone's going to see the mainstream press.

2007
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,320
There are the kooks that they are, they're trying to, they're part of this.

2008
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:26,480
They're trying to keep people from understanding what they're seeing in front of them and good

2009
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,480
for you.

2010
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,480
So respect.

2011
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:33,000
I'm trying to say in a graceful way, I don't know about your past beliefs, respect.

2012
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,880
The only thing is I want to be clear, I have nothing to do with white, anything white identitarianism

2013
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:43,120
is true, anything racist, I assume you're on the same, well, I mean, the media says

2014
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,120
Trump's a Nazi.

2015
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,120
I wouldn't support Trump if he was.

2016
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,120
It's all pure crap.

2017
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:49,640
Why, why, why did you need to bring that up?

2018
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:50,640
Apropos of nothing.

2019
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:54,880
I am just going to be here on Info Wars saying that I don't believe in any of this white

2020
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:58,200
identitarian nonsense just in case anyone asks.

2021
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,200
Yeah.

2022
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,200
I don't know.

2023
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:06,520
I, I, granted I have not taken as many media appearances as some, I've never found that

2024
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:12,080
I needed to distance myself from white identitarianism in any appearances.

2025
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:16,160
Seems like if you do that, that kind of is because you know that the person you're talking

2026
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:18,520
to might have some leanings in that direction.

2027
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,520
Or maybe you're just sitting there thinking like, oh, I'm being interviewed after Nick

2028
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,520
Fuentes.

2029
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:23,520
Oh shit.

2030
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,520
Yeah.

2031
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:27,480
I mean, this is a really complicated kind of situation.

2032
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:31,040
Look, before we go any further, I just want to let you know that I do not support the

2033
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:34,560
actions of the Thuggee cult from Temple of Doom.

2034
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,000
I don't support that.

2035
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,120
I don't know why I need to say that here.

2036
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,480
Apropos of nothing.

2037
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,040
Raises questions.

2038
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,720
So the sting, it works.

2039
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:43,720
Yeah.

2040
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:44,720
They succeed.

2041
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:45,720
They pull it off.

2042
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,720
I forgot.

2043
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,720
This ends with a success.

2044
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:49,720
Yes.

2045
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:50,720
Yeah.

2046
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:51,720
And then the cover up.

2047
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,720
Oh, it was so good.

2048
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:53,720
Yeah.

2049
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:54,720
Yeah.

2050
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:55,720
Okay.

2051
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:56,720
I got you.

2052
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:57,720
Patrick pulled off probably the best sting since the sting.

2053
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:58,720
That sounds right.

2054
01:24:58,720 --> 01:24:59,720
That sounds right.

2055
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,720
And then things fell apart.

2056
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,720
Oh no.

2057
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:05,920
So back to the, let me, I don't want to skip the punchline on all this.

2058
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,680
So they told me I needed to forget it.

2059
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,680
And I said, why?

2060
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,800
And they said, look, it's been decided at the top.

2061
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,760
We've realized there's no side Hillary.

2062
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,840
Nothing's going to stop Hillary Clinton from being president now.

2063
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,960
And the day she's president, she's going to send her men over the FBI, her people over

2064
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:24,760
the FBI and ask who was part of investigating Hillary and everyone who was part of this.

2065
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:28,040
Patrick, we're all going to be destroyed from the top to the bottom.

2066
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,320
And this includes you, Patrick.

2067
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:33,880
So it's been decided at the very top, this mission has been scrubbed and we mean it.

2068
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:37,520
You have to wipe every moment of this from your memory.

2069
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:38,520
Wow.

2070
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,520
But it's eidetic.

2071
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,520
He can't.

2072
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,520
Yes, sir.

2073
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,520
I understand.

2074
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:48,040
I don't believe any of this, none of it, but I want to be clear about something.

2075
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:53,760
If you make a claim like this, what we should do as a society is immediately put you in

2076
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:58,680
front of like the most serious court that is imaginable produce evidence because the

2077
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,520
stakes of this are way too high.

2078
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,520
Crazy.

2079
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:06,520
And telling the truth, the stakes and the importance for the public good is so important

2080
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,920
that you cannot not prove it.

2081
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:09,920
Yes, absolutely.

2082
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:14,420
If you are lying, you need to go to prison because the stakes are so serious in that

2083
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:15,420
side too.

2084
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:20,500
You can't be allowed to make these sorts of claims that are about like international espionage

2085
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:25,560
and like plots against society and just do it with impunity.

2086
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:29,260
If you can't prove this, you can't make claims like this.

2087
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:31,600
That's how I would like to see things shake up.

2088
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:36,240
I imagine a system of pneumatic tubes where you make a claim like this and then all of

2089
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:40,840
a sudden, and then you're in the court and you're like, whoa, whoa, what just happened?

2090
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:46,240
But it should not be a situation where, you know, like you're punished.

2091
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:50,320
It shouldn't be punitive unless you're clearly making this shit up.

2092
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,320
Yeah.

2093
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:52,320
Yeah.

2094
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,320
Yeah.

2095
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,320
It's just too serious.

2096
01:26:54,320 --> 01:27:00,900
And I think with swings this big, we're not dealing with quite as much nuance in the law.

2097
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:01,900
You know?

2098
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:03,740
This seems like it would be incredibly easy to prove.

2099
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:04,920
Very simple.

2100
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,800
Very simple.

2101
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:10,480
If he's telling the truth, there'd be so much documentation.

2102
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,800
I don't care about him saying like, oh, you have to wipe it from your memory.

2103
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,800
Well, guess what?

2104
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,540
Hillary didn't become president.

2105
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:21,800
So all that fear of her like reprising against people didn't come to pass.

2106
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:26,200
There'd probably be tons of people within the FBI who would corroborate your story.

2107
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,200
Sure.

2108
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,460
I'm going to guess that you remember the bag man's name.

2109
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,460
You would think.

2110
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:32,800
Maybe the country that bribed Hillary.

2111
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:33,800
I don't know.

2112
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,620
This is so offensive to me.

2113
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:40,040
So if I understand correctly, the timeline of the story goes thus, all right?

2114
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,040
Yes.

2115
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,040
December 2015.

2116
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,040
December 2015.

2117
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,040
All right.

2118
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:49,320
He kicks ass on the sting, gets all the way to somewhere in 2015 where everybody in the

2119
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:52,640
2016, they decided that Hillary is going to win.

2120
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:53,640
All right.

2121
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:54,640
So they've just decided that it's over.

2122
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:55,640
Right.

2123
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,240
And then Hillary doesn't win.

2124
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,360
And I believe that was the same year.

2125
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,360
Correct?

2126
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:01,360
Yeah.

2127
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,400
And then there was the new president on 2017.

2128
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,400
Yeah.

2129
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,400
Yeah.

2130
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,400
January.

2131
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:15,360
Now, if, if I were somebody who had just successfully executed a sting operation on Hillary Clinton.

2132
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,360
Right.

2133
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:17,520
Who was not president.

2134
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:23,520
Someone who is famous, not just not president, but someone who lost to the guy who screamed,

2135
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,520
lock her up.

2136
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:25,520
Oh yeah.

2137
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,920
And like the whole, whole big crowds of people chanting.

2138
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:33,560
I wouldn't wait until after he had lost his election to tell people I would go to him.

2139
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:34,560
Yeah.

2140
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,560
Yeah.

2141
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:44,280
If you, if you were inclined to take the gigantic risks involved in that kind of espionage sting

2142
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:45,280
operation.

2143
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:48,800
Why again, Hillary Clinton.

2144
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,000
Involving a foreign government.

2145
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Yes.

2146
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Yeah.

2147
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,680
If you're willing to take those kinds of risks, I would assume, yeah, once Trump won, you'd

2148
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:58,480
be like, I got to get in a room.

2149
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,000
Now we get to do this whole thing.

2150
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,560
Now we get to, now I get to arrest Hillary Clinton.

2151
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,900
I did all the work.

2152
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,000
It wasn't for nothing.

2153
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,400
They probably will let me do it.

2154
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,960
Like I'll put the handcuffs on her.

2155
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:12,720
I think that that didn't happen because it didn't happen.

2156
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,960
I'm going to go with that one.

2157
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:14,960
Yeah.

2158
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:15,960
That's reasonable.

2159
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:20,680
So I was kind of confused about the idea that Obama was behind this, but Patrick does clear

2160
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,560
that up here.

2161
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:28,800
And after some hemming and hawing, eventually the following story was expressed to me.

2162
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:35,180
And it runs like this, Patrick, what you need to understand, so this is late January, 2016.

2163
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:36,180
You might need to check your notes.

2164
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:39,880
What you need to understand is President Obama, and this is word for word, from there's really

2165
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:44,820
four federal people of different types involved, and this is word for word, Patrick, you need

2166
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:49,400
to understand that at this point, President Obama has his people across the federal bureaucracy,

2167
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:53,600
but especially in the Department of Justice, Hillary Clinton is going to be president for

2168
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,120
eight years and nothing is going to change that, but think of it this way.

2169
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:03,720
Think of there as being a Bunsen burner within the Department of Justice, and on that Bunsen

2170
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:08,720
burner, that information about the two bribes you were part of gathering, that'll be sitting

2171
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:09,720
there.

2172
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:13,120
But the hand on the Bunsen burner is going to be one of Barack Obama's people.

2173
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:17,400
If Hillary Clinton is a good girl and defends Obamacare and such, that flame stays low.

2174
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:22,080
If she's a bad girl and gets thinking for herself, that flame gets turned up.

2175
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:26,360
And that way, Barack Obama's going to manage Hillary Clinton for eight years, she's president.

2176
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:28,360
Well, that's exactly what the feds have tried to do.

2177
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:29,360
No, no, no.

2178
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,360
You don't want to step on the line.

2179
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,360
You don't want to step on this line, Alex.

2180
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:33,360
You want to hear-

2181
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,360
Okay, so back to the Bunsen burner.

2182
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,960
Two or three more sentences.

2183
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:39,380
Hey, the story's too good, Alex, you're interrupting.

2184
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:44,160
Do you know how many times people with an eidetic memory say, and this is word for word,

2185
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:45,160
remind you.

2186
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:46,160
They do say that a lot, I would imagine.

2187
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,160
I don't know.

2188
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:48,160
They say it-

2189
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,160
But also-

2190
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,160
They say it initially?

2191
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,160
One time.

2192
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,160
He-

2193
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,160
And then you're like, oh shit, you're telling the truth.

2194
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:57,120
They don't repeat it over and over and over again in the same story.

2195
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,120
Yeah.

2196
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,040
So Obama was going to manage Hillary.

2197
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:01,040
Yeah.

2198
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:07,280
Because he had this leverage on her with this bribe that the Overstock CEO managed to pull

2199
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,280
off.

2200
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:09,280
Right.

2201
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,280
Yeah.

2202
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,280
Here's what Alex stepped on.

2203
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:15,280
Two or three more sentences.

2204
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:18,240
That way, Barack Obama, for the whole time Hillary Clinton is president, Barack Obama's

2205
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:22,400
going to be managing her, and she's going to step down, and Michelle's going to run,

2206
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,520
and Patrick, that's the plan.

2207
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,520
Still?

2208
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:26,520
Wow.

2209
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,040
Say that again, because I did mess up the bunch line.

2210
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,480
The Bunsen burner can be turned up, it can be turned down.

2211
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:37,000
It gets down, and that way, Barack Obama's going to manage Hillary Clinton for the eight

2212
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,880
years she's president, then she's going to step down, and Michelle's going to run, and

2213
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,640
Patrick, that's the plan.

2214
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:43,640
Wow.

2215
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,840
That makes perfect sense with Biden being an Obama-

2216
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:46,840
Yes, it does.

2217
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:47,840
Literal zombie.

2218
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:48,840
Yeah.

2219
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:49,840
It makes so much sense.

2220
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:50,840
It makes perfect sense.

2221
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:56,720
This ridiculous story that this dude is telling on your show, you just take without any kind

2222
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:57,720
of critical-

2223
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:58,720
So much sense.

2224
01:31:58,720 --> 01:31:59,720
That just makes so much sense.

2225
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:02,960
No real follow-up questions as to, what the fuck are you talking about?

2226
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:03,960
Nothing like that.

2227
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:04,960
No.

2228
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:05,960
He gets to the end of the story.

2229
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:11,400
Obama set up so he could blackmail Hillary, and then eight years, he'd be the shadow president

2230
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:16,160
behind Hillary, and then his wife would be president after that.

2231
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,720
This is just absurd.

2232
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:19,720
Yeah.

2233
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:20,720
Yeah.

2234
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:21,940
Oh, boy.

2235
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:23,320
But kind of fun.

2236
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:24,320
It is kind of fun.

2237
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:25,320
A little fun.

2238
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:30,240
I do like that he thinks that it's such a great punchline, that it's Michelle that's

2239
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,240
going to run.

2240
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2241
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:38,560
I do understand that we on Infowars have been screaming about Michelle Obama becoming president

2242
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,200
since 2009, buddy.

2243
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,440
We're fine.

2244
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:44,040
They've been on that train for a while.

2245
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:47,520
You are not going to blow my mind with a, Michelle is the secret at the end of this

2246
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,520
conspiracy.

2247
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:49,520
Right.

2248
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:56,900
I also just don't think that there's a good use for this conspiracy, because it takes

2249
01:32:56,900 --> 01:33:01,760
some of the agency away from their biggest bad person, which is the Clintons.

2250
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:02,760
No.

2251
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:06,360
It's like McConnell, the secret one was Obama, it's double Obama.

2252
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:10,480
No, Hillary is like the devil that you have to be afraid of.

2253
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:15,900
It doesn't make sense for her to then be a patsy of Obama.

2254
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:19,440
It's emotionally unsatisfying for the Infowars universe.

2255
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:23,240
Also, just prove any of this, dick.

2256
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:27,360
I think it's a fun shit-talking story, and if he wrote this down and he was like, I'm

2257
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:32,800
going to try and sell this to people, one, he needs to get better at his delivery, because

2258
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,680
I don't buy this shit at all.

2259
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:38,480
This delivery doesn't matter how bad it is with Alex, he's going to believe him.

2260
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:46,080
And three, Patrick says he has two more bombshells that are coming eventually, so we may have

2261
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:52,800
even bigger swings coming in the future, but we're going to have to wait for those.

2262
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:58,360
I would love for you to release your next bombshells next Monday, if you'd like, or

2263
01:33:58,360 --> 01:33:59,680
whenever you'd like, here on air.

2264
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:03,480
We appreciate you, we appreciate your time, and thank you so much for coming on on short

2265
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:04,480
notice.

2266
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:08,560
Inshallah, Alex, and if I'm still alive, I'll come back on Monday and tell you a little

2267
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,560
bit more.

2268
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:12,720
All right, me too, I hear you.

2269
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:13,720
You'll be fine.

2270
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:19,320
This just reminds me of the Jerome Corsi might die over the weekend, he's got a dead man

2271
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,320
switch.

2272
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,840
Yeah, oh man.

2273
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:26,020
No I can't come back on Monday, Alex, it's going to take me at least another week to

2274
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:27,020
write the...

2275
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:34,040
I mean, I can't remember, oh no, I have an eidetic memory, I mean, it's, oooh, vacation!

2276
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,040
Smoke bomb.

2277
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:39,320
Yeah, so that was an interesting kind of, I don't know, change of pace.

2278
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:40,320
Little jaunt.

2279
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:41,320
Yeah, jaunt is good.

2280
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:42,320
Yeah, it was a nice little jaunt.

2281
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,040
Yeah, I found that to be just...

2282
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:48,760
I feel like I got took down the garden path for a nice little walk, and now we've come

2283
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,800
back to the house and we shall return.

2284
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:57,600
I also like the idea, too, that this Patrick guy is clearly someone who has some status,

2285
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,680
at least in his own mind.

2286
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:04,600
He'll tell Alex, you stepped on my punchline, I'm going to say these things.

2287
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:05,880
Like he's not, he's...

2288
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:06,960
I've made a lot of money.

2289
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:10,640
He has a little bit of flex on him, which is kind of fun.

2290
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,640
That is.

2291
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:16,860
But I also was thinking, like, all right, this guy's clearly a little nutty.

2292
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:19,660
Is he the new Larry?

2293
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:21,300
Is he the new Larry Nichols?

2294
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:22,680
He's got a Clinton conspiracy.

2295
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:23,680
That would be good.

2296
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:24,680
Yeah.

2297
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,640
I wonder, here's what I wonder.

2298
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:29,720
Wait, Stevie Pease wasn't on today, right?

2299
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:30,720
No.

2300
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:31,720
No.

2301
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:34,520
I'm wondering when exactly Stevie Pease is coming back.

2302
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,120
Probably tomorrow, I don't know.

2303
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,320
No, that's what I'm saying.

2304
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:41,280
What if there's a larger thing going on between Stevie and David Knight?

2305
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,280
There may be.

2306
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:45,480
And now Steve's not even going to be coming back for a little while, so we got Overstock

2307
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:49,520
guy to try and thread the needle of a Steve and a David Knight.

2308
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:50,520
Oh my God.

2309
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,960
He has so much of the Steve and so much of the Larry.

2310
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:53,960
Exactly.

2311
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:54,960
All in one.

2312
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:55,960
Yep.

2313
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:56,960
Put them in one.

2314
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:57,960
Yeah, I don't know.

2315
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:02,520
It's tough for me because, you know, we get blindsided by this news about the David Knight.

2316
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:07,040
And then, you know, as I look into the episode itself, you know, you find that, oh, maybe

2317
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,300
there's massive downsizing.

2318
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:17,280
Or maybe this is yet again Alex overplaying some kind of desperation in order to move

2319
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,280
product.

2320
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:19,280
Who knows?

2321
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,280
I don't know.

2322
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:21,280
I have no idea what's going on there.

2323
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,360
Things don't look good.

2324
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:28,920
And it makes me even more suspicious when the day before, there's really no indication

2325
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:29,920
of anything.

2326
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:30,920
Yeah.

2327
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:31,920
There's no trouble.

2328
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:32,920
Yeah.

2329
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:37,840
He's promoting the countdown, election countdown show that now apparently can't continue.

2330
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:38,840
Yeah.

2331
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:39,840
It's weird.

2332
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,360
It's, it's a, it's a little bit out of nowhere.

2333
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:46,640
Here's my, here's my pitch on, here's my conspiracy now.

2334
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:48,880
This is what I've got for you on this whole thing.

2335
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:49,880
All right.

2336
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:52,840
Uh, Info Wars, not doing great right now.

2337
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,640
Not going to go out of business, but they're not doing great right now.

2338
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:56,640
Sure.

2339
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:57,640
Okay.

2340
01:36:57,640 --> 01:37:00,660
And these months, uh, this, this little couple of weeks, you know what, everybody takes a

2341
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:02,560
Christmas vacation.

2342
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:06,840
And if you took a Christmas vacation, that wouldn't be that exciting.

2343
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:10,520
We're in the middle of fighting the goddamn Info War, you know, you can't just go out

2344
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:11,520
on vacation.

2345
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:12,520
I see what you're doing.

2346
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:15,320
So what we do is we say, we got to let you go.

2347
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:19,280
I save money on overhead costs for a couple of weeks.

2348
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:23,400
After the big Christmas sale, we get all, oh, for sure.

2349
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,540
After the big Christmas sale, we get all the money in.

2350
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:29,520
And then I'm like, guys, we're bringing David Knight back!

2351
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:31,280
And we've retooled his show.

2352
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,280
Exactly.

2353
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:33,280
Huh?

2354
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:34,280
Yeah.

2355
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:35,280
That would be interesting.

2356
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,280
That would be interesting.

2357
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,280
That would be interesting either.

2358
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,280
Yeah.

2359
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:42,320
I am interested to see what ends up happening, uh, but not that interested.

2360
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,320
Sure.

2361
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:44,320
I'm torn.

2362
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:47,040
I want them to do some work to make me interested in it.

2363
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,040
Yes.

2364
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,040
Yeah.

2365
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,040
Make me care.

2366
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,040
Make me care.

2367
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:52,040
Fight.

2368
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:53,040
Do something for my amusement.

2369
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:56,920
The other thing too that I think is really key is that, like, Alex is about to enter

2370
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:02,320
a very profitable space, which is returning to the attacking the GOP.

2371
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,320
Right.

2372
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:10,320
His purity in the GOP kind of thing is a really, really profitable sector for, like, right-wing

2373
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:11,320
talk shows.

2374
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:12,320
Oh yeah.

2375
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:13,320
It's worked for millions of years.

2376
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:14,320
Right.

2377
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:22,320
But he also has never had to do it while there were large funded, uh, competitors.

2378
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,320
Yeah.

2379
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:26,520
And I don't know if he can, uh, beat OAM.

2380
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:27,520
Yeah.

2381
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:32,760
It's difficult whenever you also have, like, because before you had Fox News crashing the

2382
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:38,040
Tea Party wing, just like, fuck yeah, let's ride or die on killing everybody.

2383
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:42,920
But Alex even then still got to exist in that space of, like, everybody sucks and I hate

2384
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:46,560
them all, but Obama's the devil and, you know, that whole thing.

2385
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,360
But Fox News wasn't also hating Mitch McConnell at the time.

2386
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:55,560
No, they did have Glenn Beck being a little nutty, a little conspiracy-ish, but, like-

2387
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:59,400
But Glenn Beck didn't have two networks that they were competing, you know, you know what

2388
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:00,400
I'm saying?

2389
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:01,400
Right, right.

2390
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,400
Yeah.

2391
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:06,400
There was some competition in the form of Glenn Beck, but Alex was still, like, he would

2392
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,520
say a lot of shit that Glenn Beck probably wouldn't.

2393
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:09,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2394
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,080
And so, I don't know.

2395
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:16,960
I don't know substantially what he can do to differentiate himself from the competitors

2396
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,360
now, but- A good job I think is the only thing he could

2397
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,160
do and I don't think he's capable of that.

2398
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:22,160
Don't think it's possible.

2399
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:23,160
No.

2400
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:25,360
Based on this interview with the Overstock guy, I don't think it's possible.

2401
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,240
I don't think we're seeing that kind of turnaround.

2402
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:28,240
Certainly not.

2403
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:29,240
It's a Christmas miracle!

2404
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:30,240
No.

2405
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:31,240
Uh, we'll be back, folks.

2406
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,440
But until then, we have a website.

2407
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:34,440
We do have a website.

2408
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:35,440
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,440

01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:37,440

01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:39,440

01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:41,440
We are Facebook.

2415
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,800
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out those doing

2416
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:45,800
God's work right now.

2417
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:46,800
Yeah, we'll be back.

2418
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:47,800
But until then, I'm Neo.

2419
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:48,800
I'm Leo.

2420
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:49,800
I'm DZXClark.

2421
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:50,800
I'm Daryl Rundis.

2422
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,400
I'm more like out of stock.com.

2423
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:54,400
Andy in Kansas.

2424
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:55,400
You're on the air.

2425
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:56,400
Thanks for holding.

2426
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:57,400
Hello, Alex.

2427
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:58,400
I'm a first time caller.

2428
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,400
I'm a huge fan.

2429
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:00,400
I love your work.

2430
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:01,400
I love you.
