N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:18.040
Damn and Jordan, I am sweating

00:18.040 --> 00:21.400
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

00:21.400 --> 00:23.880
I have great respect for knowledgefight

00:23.880 --> 00:25.160
knowledgefight

00:25.160 --> 00:27.400
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

00:27.400 --> 00:28.920
saying we are the bad guys

00:28.920 --> 00:30.040
knowledgefight

00:30.040 --> 00:32.200
Damn and Jordan, knowledgefight

00:32.200 --> 00:34.400
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

00:34.400 --> 00:36.480
I need, I need money

00:36.480 --> 00:39.320
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

00:39.320 --> 00:42.160
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and

00:42.160 --> 00:44.720
Stop it, Andy and, Andy and Kansas

00:44.720 --> 00:47.120
Andy, Andy, it's time to pray

00:47.120 --> 00:49.400
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding me

00:49.400 --> 00:51.800
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm with your Japan

00:51.800 --> 00:53.000
I love your room

00:57.040 --> 00:59.200
I love you

00:59.200 --> 01:01.160
Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan

01:01.160 --> 01:01.760
I'm Jordan

01:01.760 --> 01:03.440
We're couple dudes, I can sit around, drink knowledge

01:03.440 --> 01:05.280
beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:05.280 --> 01:06.400
Oh indeed we are Dan

01:06.400 --> 01:06.840
Jordan

01:06.840 --> 01:07.160
Dan

01:07.160 --> 01:07.480
Jordan

01:07.480 --> 01:08.480
I have a quick question for you

01:08.480 --> 01:08.920
Yes sir

01:08.920 --> 01:09.720
What's your bright spot today?

01:09.720 --> 01:13.880
My bright spot today is, you know, just the recognition

01:13.880 --> 01:18.440
that, you know, decades from now, centuries from now

01:18.440 --> 01:21.760
this will be looked upon as the week of too much of you and me

01:21.760 --> 01:28.080
Quite a week of too much of us

01:28.080 --> 01:35.560
Dan, I think that you are underestimating exactly how much more we're going to do in the weeks to come

01:35.560 --> 01:43.280
This is an extensive week of programming between our episode on our Patreon

01:43.280 --> 01:46.960
our little bonus episode and then also thank you to Robert and Sophie

01:46.960 --> 01:49.160
Yes, huge thanks to Robert and Sophie

01:49.160 --> 01:54.480
Behind the Bastards and I got to bring up something, I got to bring information to the table

01:54.480 --> 01:56.200
that everyone is unaware of

01:56.200 --> 01:56.640
Yes

01:56.640 --> 02:00.160
About invention from Goldwater

02:00.160 --> 02:02.480
Yes, I do recall that

02:02.480 --> 02:02.880
Yeah

02:02.880 --> 02:03.280
Yes

02:03.280 --> 02:07.200
That's something we've talked about on this show but apparently was new to the proceedings

02:07.200 --> 02:09.680
I would say that you were so excited to

02:09.680 --> 02:10.440
Very excited

02:10.440 --> 02:15.480
You were incredibly excited, you were shivering and shaking almost as though there was

02:15.480 --> 02:19.280
like a bug in my pants

02:19.280 --> 02:21.840
You know, it's just something I couldn't feel but it was there

02:21.840 --> 02:24.160
So yeah, I guess that's my bright spot, too much of us

02:24.160 --> 02:24.480
Yeah

02:24.480 --> 02:26.120
How about you?

02:26.120 --> 02:30.040
My bright spot is Dan Taylor Swift

02:30.040 --> 02:33.880
Taylor Swift is my bright spot because you're so mad

02:33.880 --> 02:36.200
I was worried about this

02:36.200 --> 02:40.600
No, yeah, I decided to start listening to every Taylor Swift

02:40.600 --> 02:43.720
I've never listened to Taylor Swift at all

02:43.720 --> 02:46.280
You've never been to a Walgreens?

02:46.280 --> 02:50.000
On purpose or in full, is that a better way of putting it?

02:50.000 --> 02:54.440
So I've never done that before and then I was, I've really been struggling to come up

02:54.440 --> 03:00.040
with a project since the book ended and I've just been like throwing shit at the wall and

03:00.040 --> 03:01.000
it's not been going well

03:01.000 --> 03:03.240
Well, here comes another piece of spaghetti

03:03.240 --> 03:07.360
For some reason I was like, you know what, now I'm going to do it so I've decided to

03:07.360 --> 03:12.520
listen to every one of Taylor Swift's albums in a row, chronological order and review each

03:12.520 --> 03:13.040
one

03:13.040 --> 03:17.000
We talked about this a little bit and I resent you for this because I think it's going to

03:17.000 --> 03:18.520
have a really negative tone

03:18.520 --> 03:20.520
Oh man, is it dark

03:20.520 --> 03:20.960
Yeah

03:20.960 --> 03:26.480
It is very fun to be incredibly mean to a seventeen year old who is going to go on to

03:26.480 --> 03:27.320
be a billionaire

03:27.320 --> 03:33.120
Yeah, but I also resent that at this point you're still at a point where I can't really

03:33.120 --> 03:34.360
rebut anything you're saying

03:34.360 --> 03:34.640
Of course

03:34.640 --> 03:36.640
I don't know anything about Taylor Swift's first album

03:36.640 --> 03:37.480
Sure, sure, sure

03:37.480 --> 03:42.440
But if you start getting real shitty about some of those later albums we might have words

03:42.440 --> 03:48.280
I think if you read it you will find that I am very complimentary towards things that

03:48.280 --> 03:49.960
deserve complimenting

03:49.960 --> 03:54.080
And I am hyperbolically incredibly cruel to things that are just meh

03:54.080 --> 03:54.520
Okay

03:54.520 --> 03:56.320
You know, that's kind of how I like to do it

03:56.320 --> 03:57.760
I'll check it out, where can people find this?

03:57.760 --> 04:04.320
People can find it on a friend of the show Matthias Drufki's website fancyboysclub.com

04:04.320 --> 04:09.600
I'll be posting those probably once a week or until I get really pissed off at Taylor

04:09.600 --> 04:11.280
Swift and decide never to do this again

04:11.280 --> 04:15.560
And if I get bored enough I will write scheming rebuttals

04:15.560 --> 04:16.560
I think that would be fun

04:16.560 --> 04:18.840
But there will be only personally attacking you

04:18.840 --> 04:19.680
Yes, I would love that

04:19.680 --> 04:22.160
There's nothing to do with the music, just personally attacking you

04:22.160 --> 04:26.000
What you should do is do the exact same thing but for each chapter of my book

04:26.000 --> 04:26.400
Right

04:26.400 --> 04:28.160
Every week we'll just hate each other

04:28.160 --> 04:31.440
Has Jordan ever written a pop masterpiece?

04:31.440 --> 04:32.320
No

04:32.320 --> 04:34.240
Absolutely not

04:34.240 --> 04:36.800
Alright, well Jordan today we've got an interesting episode to go over

04:36.800 --> 04:39.840
We're going to be talking about December 16th and 17th, 2020

04:39.840 --> 04:40.920
I'm Dan, this is 2020

04:40.920 --> 04:42.200
Hooray!

04:42.200 --> 04:46.760
Shit got interesting and weird this week so we're going to have a little bit of a, I don't

04:46.760 --> 04:48.160
know, memento style

04:48.160 --> 04:51.520
We're going to start with December 17th

04:51.520 --> 04:53.120
And then we're going to go back

04:53.120 --> 04:54.720
I've heard some news

04:54.720 --> 04:55.520
Yeah

04:55.520 --> 04:59.200
So before we get to the episode, let's take a little moment to say thank you to some folks

04:59.200 --> 05:00.800
who have signed up and are supporting the show

05:00.800 --> 05:04.320

05:14.920 --> 05:15.920

05:28.840 --> 05:31.800
Next, Jonathan T, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:31.800 --> 05:33.000
I'm a policy wonk

05:33.000 --> 05:34.720
Thank you very much JT

05:34.720 --> 05:36.040
And...

05:36.040 --> 05:36.560
Hmm?

05:36.560 --> 05:37.200
What?

05:37.200 --> 05:38.120
Triple T?

05:38.120 --> 05:39.120
Are you talking about home improvement?

05:39.120 --> 05:40.120
Couple JTTs?

05:40.120 --> 05:41.120
No.

05:41.120 --> 05:44.120
And finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on an elevated

05:44.120 --> 05:45.120
level.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.120
We appreciate that very much.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.600
So, Big Easy Blasphemy, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.600
And Cory S, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.600
I'm a policy wonk.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.600
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.600
Have yourself a brew.

05:54.600 --> 05:55.600
How's your 401k doing, bro?

05:55.600 --> 06:00.000
All right, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.500
Let's just get down to business.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.560
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.500
Why you pimps so good?

06:05.500 --> 06:07.140
My neck is freakishly large.

06:07.140 --> 06:09.840
I declare info war on you.

06:09.840 --> 06:12.360
Thank you so much, Big Easy Blasphemy, and thank you so much, Cory.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.840
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.400
If you're out there listening and you're thinking, hey, I enjoy this show, I'd like to support

06:16.400 --> 06:19.240
what these gents do, you can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com, clicking

06:19.240 --> 06:20.920
the button that says support the show, or...

06:20.920 --> 06:26.240
What you could do is create some sort of tortured analogy towards trying to find writing something

06:26.240 --> 06:28.760
about Taylor Swift into a generosity thing.

06:28.760 --> 06:34.440
But I would just suggest that you guys go to your local charity or bail fund and support

06:34.440 --> 06:35.440
people that way.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.400
Go to the easy road on this show.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.840
Man, it was just gonna be, I was thinking about it on the way here.

06:40.840 --> 06:42.560
You were trying to get a little too meta with it right there.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.560
I was trying to, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:44.560 --> 06:45.560
It was tough.

06:45.560 --> 06:46.560
It's a tough one.

06:46.560 --> 06:47.560
Yeah, that's all right.

06:47.560 --> 06:52.480
So, I wanted to play The Sound of Silence to start this episode, but that would be very

06:52.480 --> 06:55.000
hacky, so I decided not to.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
Oh, well, real quick, I have one piece of business, just real quick, right off the top.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Somebody reached out to me.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.120
Nothing to do with The Sound of Silence.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.320
Nothing to do with The Sound of Silence, completely unrelated.

07:04.320 --> 07:12.160
Somebody reached out to me, and she asked me politely if we would wish her partner a

07:12.160 --> 07:13.920
happy birthday.

07:13.920 --> 07:18.760
His name is Joe, and I was told that the way to identify him was that he skips over our

07:18.760 --> 07:19.760
theme song.

07:19.760 --> 07:20.760
Oh, shit.

07:20.760 --> 07:24.880
Yeah, which then made me be like, am I even gonna fucking do this now?

07:24.880 --> 07:25.880
There we go.

07:25.880 --> 07:26.880
We're gonna play it again.

07:26.880 --> 07:27.880
That's what's gonna happen.

07:27.880 --> 07:28.880
Take that.

07:28.880 --> 07:29.880
Yes, yes.

07:29.880 --> 07:30.880
Happy birthday, Joe.

07:30.880 --> 07:31.880
Happy birthday, Joe.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.600
I hope you have a good one.

07:34.600 --> 07:39.880
It's been a tough year for everybody, you know, everybody who had a birthday this year,

07:39.880 --> 07:41.880
wasn't their favorite birthday, I'm sure.

07:41.880 --> 07:42.880
Totally.

07:42.880 --> 07:43.880
Mine wasn't.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.880
Nope.

07:44.880 --> 07:45.880
Nope.

07:45.880 --> 07:46.880
And hey, here's the other thing.

07:46.880 --> 07:47.880
What's up?

07:47.880 --> 07:53.280
If you are dating a Joe, or married to a Joe, or whatever with a Joe who also skips over

07:53.280 --> 07:55.720
the theme song, tell them it was you.

07:55.720 --> 07:56.720
Tell them it was you.

07:56.720 --> 07:57.720
We won't tell.

07:57.720 --> 07:58.720
Totally.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.720
I'm not saying anything.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.720
I'm not gonna follow up on that shit.

08:00.720 --> 08:01.720
We're not snitches.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.720
I'm sorry to lie to your partner.

08:02.720 --> 08:06.840
I built a strong relationship.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.880
And now, back to The Sound of Silence.

08:08.880 --> 08:09.880
Yes, indeed.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.520
Hello Darkness, my old friend.

08:12.520 --> 08:16.840
I couldn't help but like find, I was, look, okay.

08:16.840 --> 08:21.640
Beginning of the week, we had the rallies in DC, and then I was kind of planning on

08:21.640 --> 08:28.280
this episode to like cover the very predictable and obvious reactions Alex would have to it.

08:28.280 --> 08:34.400
But then, today, Thursday, as it was getting game time to do this episode, we got hit with

08:34.400 --> 08:35.400
some big news.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.960
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:36.960 --> 08:43.720
At Libertyterion on Twitter, the one person at Infowars who has managed to duck getting

08:43.720 --> 08:49.160
banned because he's too boring for anyone to notice is there, David Knight announced

08:49.160 --> 08:53.760
that he was fired, effective immediately, from Infowars.

08:53.760 --> 08:54.760
Oh boy.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.320
Stevie P's got to him in the end, huh?

08:56.320 --> 08:59.000
I don't know if that's the case.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.840
That is the obvious thing that you would think, because David Knight has been on a bit of

09:02.840 --> 09:07.960
a public vendetta against Steve Pachanik, who has been trying to convince people at

09:07.960 --> 09:14.120
Infowars that the election was a grand sting operation, and David Knight's not having any

09:14.120 --> 09:15.120
of that bullshit.

09:15.120 --> 09:19.640
David Knight fired for being inexplicably a half-truth teller.

09:19.640 --> 09:23.480
To his credit, he responded appropriately to that.

09:23.480 --> 09:29.680
Although to not his credit, he also, you know, the last time he had Steve on, he said, yes,

09:29.680 --> 09:34.440
I believe Sandy Hook was a false flag, but I will not agree with you about Las Vegas.

09:34.440 --> 09:35.880
So I don't know where his line is.

09:35.880 --> 09:37.120
He's a half-truth teller.

09:37.120 --> 09:42.480
Yeah, and this big, this big news, and I don't want to shit on somebody when they're down

09:42.480 --> 09:47.160
or like make fun of it, but I mean, like, it's relevant to our interests.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.800
David Knight has been there forever.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.120
He's been there 10 years, probably?

09:52.120 --> 09:53.120
Something like that.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.120
Totally.

09:54.120 --> 09:59.800
He has always been there through the thick and thin of so much horrible bullshit.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.440
Went along with Alex as he got into Trump.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.620
Maybe Alex just remembered that David Knight was there, and he was like, shit, I meant

10:06.620 --> 10:09.120
to fire him five years ago, and then I just forgot.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.400
He's just so boring.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.600
I don't know.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.120
I'm actually kind of conflicted.

10:13.120 --> 10:18.660
I'm not entirely sure what I think the case is here, and I think we'll discuss this as

10:18.660 --> 10:19.660
we go through the episode.

10:19.660 --> 10:23.280
So we're going to start with the 17th, and we're going to start with Alex's conversation

10:23.280 --> 10:27.920
about, because I think he knew he needed to get ahead of this.

10:27.920 --> 10:31.800
And so he has fired David at this point.

10:31.800 --> 10:32.800
We're past it.

10:32.800 --> 10:33.800
Yes.

10:33.800 --> 10:38.720
And so Thursday's show, he's going to deal with some housekeeping business for a little

10:38.720 --> 10:39.720
bit.

10:39.720 --> 10:42.640
First thing I want to say, the tank was a good idea.

10:42.640 --> 10:43.640
It was a good idea.

10:43.640 --> 10:44.640
Solid investment.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.280
It was a good investment.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.600
Anyways, we have lost some personnel.

10:48.600 --> 10:55.960
The tank brings in more money than David Knight, sells more pills.

10:55.960 --> 11:00.800
So we're going to look at that, and then we're going to flash back to the 16th, and we're

11:00.800 --> 11:04.680
just going to discuss what kind of content was going on there, because I got just bored

11:04.680 --> 11:09.800
as hell after Alex stopped talking about current events of his own issues.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.600
So here's an out of context drop from today's show.

11:11.600 --> 11:16.600
Now I don't want to liken myself to a US president, but this job is about as close as it gets.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.600
Okay.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.600
All right.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.600
I mean, currently, maybe.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.600
Maybe.

11:21.600 --> 11:25.840
Look, I talk shit and vaguely read headlines.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.640
I'm basically the president.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.200
Pretty close.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.800
Pretty close when you get down to it.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.760
I get lied to by weirdos as a profession.

11:33.760 --> 11:34.760
Yeah.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.240
I too like Stephen Miller.

11:36.240 --> 11:42.400
So I kind of had a sense that it was going to be something that Alex has to bring up,

11:42.400 --> 11:45.360
because David Knight has made this public.

11:45.360 --> 11:46.600
He's come out with it.

11:46.600 --> 11:53.520
So Alex frames things this way when he gets going on the show on the 17th and he was late.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.520
He was late for the show.

11:54.520 --> 12:00.040
There was some special reports at the beginning, and I've got a really huge announcement coming

12:00.040 --> 12:06.280
up at the bottom of the hour about the future of info Wars and about this organization and

12:06.280 --> 12:10.160
a restructuring we're going to be doing that'll be announced today.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.600
I've waited long enough and I've told folks about how we're under attack and what's going

12:13.600 --> 12:17.480
on with info Wars, and I don't think people take that serious sometimes.

12:17.480 --> 12:22.960
But info Wars is fighting for its life, just like the rest of the country and the rest

12:22.960 --> 12:23.960
of the world is.

12:23.960 --> 12:24.960
We don't get globalist money.

12:24.960 --> 12:29.920
We didn't get the $10.6 million that black lives matter got from the new world order.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.920
And the only money we get is from you.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.600
And we can't fight if you don't support us.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.600
We'll be right back.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.600
Stay with us.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.560
So there's restructuring going on in the info war.

12:38.560 --> 12:39.560
Yes.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.560
There's demotions.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.560
Clearly.

12:41.560 --> 12:42.560
Yeah.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.560
There's nothing really specific yet at this point.

12:44.560 --> 12:47.720
There's just kind of like the insinuation that we're going to talk about what the future

12:47.720 --> 12:49.280
is going to look like around here.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.280
Yeah.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.280
Yeah.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.280
Yeah.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.280
And I podcasts.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.280
They're the future.

12:54.280 --> 12:59.120
I grow weary of this quite honestly, because we've been, we've been on this track before

12:59.120 --> 13:05.560
we've, we've done some laps around this, uh, granted the move of firing David Knight.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.080
That one wasn't really big.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.080
That's a big one.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.080
Yeah.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.280
That one's tough to, to undersell.

13:10.280 --> 13:14.240
That's, that's tough to look at as like, Oh, you're just blowing smoke.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.240
Yeah.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.240
There's something there.

13:16.240 --> 13:19.760
Now, whether it's like a resources are tight.

13:19.760 --> 13:23.720
I got a call from Melania and she said, get rid of David Knight.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.720
Sure.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.760
Is it the Steve situation or is it a money?

13:26.760 --> 13:27.760
Yeah.

13:27.760 --> 13:28.760
I don't know.

13:28.760 --> 13:29.760
Could be.

13:29.760 --> 13:30.760
I don't know.

13:30.760 --> 13:31.760
I can't tell.

13:31.760 --> 13:32.760
So, uh, I was like, what else is going on here?

13:32.760 --> 13:36.240
Alex got anything to talk about other than your own dumb bullshit.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.920
Trump tried to turn our economy back on, get us out of the global system.

13:38.920 --> 13:45.240
He did really a splendid job on many fronts, made some big mistakes and still with 34 days

13:45.240 --> 13:46.240
left.

13:46.240 --> 13:52.960
If he levels with the American people in resolute desk speeches and asked for 10 million Americans

13:52.960 --> 13:58.360
to March on Washington peacefully, but to March on all our other capitals, to demonstrate

13:58.360 --> 14:02.600
that we know there's massive election fraud and that we repudiate the globalist corporate

14:02.600 --> 14:08.500
media, the NWL has a very good chance of folding up and backing down.

14:08.500 --> 14:12.640
Because then the justice department and others will have the courage to do the right thing

14:12.640 --> 14:13.640
and prosecute.

14:13.640 --> 14:19.680
So Alex is pretending that bunch of people could go March and then the new world order

14:19.680 --> 14:21.000
would be like, Oh no.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Yeah.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
What about plan B?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Nah, it's a show of force.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
What about plan B?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
What about plan B?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Yeah.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
There's 10 million people in one spot.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.120
You can't do plan B when they're all there.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.120
That would be perfect.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.120
That's when you gas them all.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.120
There's too many.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.480
That's when you hit the bio weapon.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.920
That's what plan B is.

14:35.920 --> 14:40.480
There's not enough bio weapon, it would be too diffuse and everybody would get a little

14:40.480 --> 14:41.480
sick.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.480
That's not how a bio weapon works.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.040
This is a super bio weapon.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.280
You forgot that plan B is a super bio weapon.

14:46.280 --> 14:49.760
Yeah, a super bio weapon hits 5 million people in one place max.

14:49.760 --> 14:50.760
That's twice as many.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.720
I just, I just can't, I can't get it up for this kind of thing.

14:53.720 --> 14:54.720
No, this is sad.

14:54.720 --> 14:55.720
He doesn't even believe it.

14:55.720 --> 14:56.720
No.

14:56.720 --> 15:00.520
I can't, I can't handle the guy trying to tell me that like, Oh, we just need a bunch

15:00.520 --> 15:05.520
of people to March and then maybe the cabal of people who've been planning this for thousands

15:05.520 --> 15:10.360
of years will be like, Oh no, people, when Alex has already said that there's a plan

15:10.360 --> 15:15.420
B, if all of, if they manage to like, even if they get Trump back in office, there's

15:15.420 --> 15:19.840
a plan B that's just everyone dies, but it's a little less organized.

15:19.840 --> 15:20.840
Yeah.

15:20.840 --> 15:24.840
Like I don't, I don't, how, how, why, what does this matter?

15:24.840 --> 15:25.840
I don't know.

15:25.840 --> 15:31.220
But the idea of the devil who has been with humanity since there were two and now there

15:31.220 --> 15:35.660
are several billion of us for him to be like, Whoa, 10 million is just too much for me to

15:35.660 --> 15:36.660
look.

15:36.660 --> 15:38.400
I got to tell the NWO to back off.

15:38.400 --> 15:42.800
That's just mathematically a little bit problematic because you have to assume that the new world

15:42.800 --> 15:45.080
order would be doing the devil's bidding.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.080
They would have to.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.080
Right.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.880
The only reason that they're doing the things that they're doing is because the devil has

15:48.880 --> 15:50.600
told them that they should.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.600
Right.

15:51.600 --> 15:55.800
And I mean, yeah, if the devil is like, who cares about 10 million people marching, it's

15:55.800 --> 15:56.800
no big deal.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.760
You'd assume they would just keep going with their plans.

15:58.760 --> 16:02.880
Does the devil phone or does he appear?

16:02.880 --> 16:03.880
I don't know.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.400
He seems really interested in domestic politics.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.400
He really does.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.400
I feel like he should get a phone.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.720
It's a whole big world out there for the devil.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.720
Does the devil email?

16:12.720 --> 16:17.880
Cause if he's appearing everywhere, this is, this is, this is stupid and it feels trivial

16:17.880 --> 16:20.360
even within Alex's own conspiracies.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.360
I just don't care.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.360
No, this is dumb.

16:22.360 --> 16:26.000
So how about you get back to your bullshit, Alex, I want to hear more about your, your

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
situation.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.600
And info wars, I'm giving you the good news.

16:30.600 --> 16:36.880
Info wars has three to five times the audience on a day-to-day basis that we've ever had

16:36.880 --> 16:38.680
except for right around the last election.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.960
And that's despite all the de-platforming.

16:40.960 --> 16:44.160
What we do not have is the funding we had then.

16:44.160 --> 16:50.720
And so I'm the type of guy that has kept everybody employed, kept the shows going, kept us in

16:50.720 --> 16:57.400
the, in the field, kept funding everything, mortgaged my house a year ago to be able to

16:57.400 --> 17:03.720
have emergency funding, to, to, to run this operation, to, to take care of shortfalls.

17:03.720 --> 17:09.760
But I can look at the other things I have as, as an emergency backup, and it wouldn't

17:09.760 --> 17:14.760
fund this place for a month if I had to liquidate everything I've got.

17:14.760 --> 17:19.760
Cause this is a big operation, our own satellites, our own IT, our own feeds, our own everything,

17:19.760 --> 17:21.480
all the DNC lawsuits against us, everything.

17:21.480 --> 17:22.480
Wait, wait, wait, the DNC lawsuits?

17:22.480 --> 17:23.480
DNC?

17:23.480 --> 17:24.480
DNC lawsuits?

17:24.480 --> 17:25.480
Uh, I don't know about that.

17:25.480 --> 17:26.480
What are the DNC doing?

17:26.480 --> 17:29.240
Uh, also I think that's called being overextended.

17:29.240 --> 17:30.240
Yeah.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:31.240 --> 17:32.240
That's, um...

17:32.240 --> 17:38.040
You could, you could also put that thusly, um, we should have scaled back.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.040
Mm-hmm.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.040
Mm-hmm.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.040
Long time ago.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.040
Yeah.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.040
No reason to not have.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.040
Mm-hmm.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.360
That tank was a bad purchase.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.600
No need for that tank.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.000
Um, this studio looks great.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
It looks amazing.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.440
Completely pointless.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.240
Maybe too big for just one person to sit there.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.240
Yeah.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.240
Yeah.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.240
Could be too big.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.240
Maybe a little ostentatious.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.240
Ostentatious.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.240
Oh, ooh.

18:00.240 --> 18:03.880
The stumble upon a pun that Ralphie May made years ago with the name of one of his specials.

18:03.880 --> 18:04.880
Yeah.

18:04.880 --> 18:05.880
I don't like that.

18:05.880 --> 18:06.880
I remember that.

18:06.880 --> 18:07.880
Mm-hmm.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.400
Anyway, uh, look, you need to buy his products cause Alex needs money.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.400
Sure.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.400
And you know what?

18:12.400 --> 18:13.400
You need them too.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.400
You need the products too.

18:14.400 --> 18:21.360
I had one of the crew members over here, tore his leg, had some medical stuff, went to the

18:21.360 --> 18:22.360
doctor.

18:22.360 --> 18:27.040
They wanted to put him on stuff for his low, low T. He didn't do it.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.040
Got tested again.

18:28.040 --> 18:32.200
He came in on Monday or Tuesday, he said, look at this, I got tested, started taking

18:32.200 --> 18:34.120
super male vitality and look at my numbers.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.120
It was incredible.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.120
I had to check with lawyers.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.120
We can even show you this stuff.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.120
There's the other system.

18:38.120 --> 18:42.780
So you're not supposed to know what herbs can do, but that's the type of things that

18:42.780 --> 18:45.520
are happening and that are going on.

18:45.520 --> 18:49.320
And I'm just here to tell you, and you've come through over and over again.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.360
I keep telling you, we can't keep operating.

18:51.360 --> 18:53.120
We can't keep doing it at this level.

18:53.120 --> 18:57.240
If you don't support us, if you don't pray for us, if you don't spread the word, we're

18:57.240 --> 19:00.800
way more hardcore than Newsmax, OAN, everybody else.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.880
And I love them.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.840
I hope they get more hardcore than I am.

19:03.840 --> 19:04.840
And I like OAN.

19:04.840 --> 19:07.160
You know, we're on cloud TV.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.160
Number one.

19:08.160 --> 19:12.120
OAN and Newsmax are the worst thing that could happen for Alex.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:13.120 --> 19:18.660
The fact that those two outlets are doing slick shit, they have some sort of financing

19:18.660 --> 19:21.880
from some mysterious source, I'm sure.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.800
They have better than 19 year olds working in their rooms.

19:24.800 --> 19:29.160
They have the ability to pretend that they're news.

19:29.160 --> 19:32.160
They don't act like Alex screaming about the devil.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.480
They say the same shit.

19:33.480 --> 19:34.480
Absolutely.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.480
They get to...

19:35.480 --> 19:36.480
They have...

19:36.480 --> 19:37.480
They're like all David Knights.

19:37.480 --> 19:38.480
Yeah.

19:38.480 --> 19:43.120
They have the editorial standards of Alex, but the appearance of a news thing.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.120
Yeah.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.120
It's the worst thing ever for Alex.

19:45.120 --> 19:49.040
He has no place in the market anymore, unless he does something different.

19:49.040 --> 19:56.080
He has to pivot, or else it will just be, I'm another one of them that no one will plug

19:56.080 --> 19:59.960
because I suck, because I'm so toxic.

19:59.960 --> 20:00.960
It's funny.

20:00.960 --> 20:06.960
I kind of think Alex is confused by that, because I really do think that when he sees

20:06.960 --> 20:11.600
his set and the way his show runs, he's like, this looks like a news organization.

20:11.600 --> 20:12.600
Yeah.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.600
You know?

20:13.600 --> 20:14.600
He totally thinks that.

20:14.600 --> 20:15.600
Yep.

20:15.600 --> 20:19.160
So how can he look at OAN and Newsmax and be like, they're just like me.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.160
You know?

20:20.160 --> 20:21.160
Isn't that wild?

20:21.160 --> 20:23.200
I don't think he watches anything other than...

20:23.200 --> 20:24.200
Oh, that's fair.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.480
I bet he doesn't have the time for it, nor the interest.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.480
That's fair.

20:27.480 --> 20:31.720
I think it's actually kind of interesting that because those things exist, things like

20:31.720 --> 20:37.440
Newsmax or OAN, David Knight could easily get a job at either of them.

20:37.440 --> 20:43.640
They've accidentally created employability for the people that work for Alex.

20:43.640 --> 20:44.640
Right.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.160
Who art Alex?

20:46.160 --> 20:51.080
They've created a situation where he can't hold people hostage working at Infowars anymore.

20:51.080 --> 20:56.040
If you have aspirations to be a right-wing shit journalist, there are other options now.

20:56.040 --> 20:57.040
Yeah.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.040
Yeah.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.040
Alex.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.040
Oh, God.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.460
I think the good news is Schroyer's not going anywhere.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.480
I don't think so.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.380
Even after, you know?

21:04.380 --> 21:05.800
Nobody's hiring...

21:05.800 --> 21:09.640
Even Newsmax is going to see OAN Schroyer walk in and be like, and you may turn around

21:09.640 --> 21:10.640
now?

21:10.640 --> 21:15.280
I can't tell exactly from listening to this, but it does appear that OAN is the only other

21:15.280 --> 21:17.680
person who survived the axe.

21:17.680 --> 21:18.960
Oh, shit.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.120
The axe.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.520
Like straight up axe.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.520
We'll get to it.

21:22.520 --> 21:23.520
Oh, boy.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.520
Now I'm excited.

21:24.520 --> 21:25.520
I might have shown my cards too early.

21:25.520 --> 21:26.520
You might have shown too many cards.

21:26.520 --> 21:30.640
But we should know that Alex is being very clear that he's not quitting.

21:30.640 --> 21:31.640
Okay.

21:31.640 --> 21:36.560
And so, you know, I said on Joe Rogan's show five weeks ago, I said, I've thought about

21:36.560 --> 21:42.080
retiring and the media thought that was just, you know, Jones trying to act like he's this

21:42.080 --> 21:43.080
reluctant hero.

21:43.080 --> 21:45.600
But that's not what it is.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.600
Reluctant hero?

21:46.600 --> 21:51.840
I only dream about this stuff 90% of the time, used to 5% of the time.

21:51.840 --> 21:56.400
I have basically no life other than this.

21:56.400 --> 22:00.720
That's all I do and I still feel like I'm not doing enough, but I'm not going to quit.

22:00.720 --> 22:05.240
I can't imagine it being his life and him being so bad at this.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.240
Yeah.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.800
What are you putting time into?

22:07.800 --> 22:08.800
I don't know.

22:08.800 --> 22:09.800
I don't know.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.820
What could he possibly be?

22:11.820 --> 22:16.040
In regards to the show, okay, you've dedicated your life to this show.

22:16.040 --> 22:21.240
You talk for three to four hours for being a very generous day.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.240
Yeah.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.240
Or someone cancels.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.240
Right.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.240
Right.

22:25.240 --> 22:26.240
Right.

22:26.240 --> 22:31.000
And you read and I think something happens while you are holding a thing.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.060
He reads headlines.

22:32.060 --> 22:36.560
There are words that he sees that then become brain thoughts, but I don't know what reading

22:36.560 --> 22:37.560
would be for him.

22:37.560 --> 22:42.820
The only thing I can imagine that would take a lot of time is maybe it requires like extensive

22:42.820 --> 22:49.200
meditation or yoga in order to get into his like prophetic psychic trance or whatever

22:49.200 --> 22:51.000
that he says he can kick himself into.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Okay.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.360
So he reads headlines and then like gets into some kind of a weird trance state.

22:56.360 --> 22:57.360
Sure.

22:57.360 --> 23:02.440
And then he reports on what the trance showed him about this headline as opposed to reading

23:02.440 --> 23:03.440
the article.

23:03.440 --> 23:04.440
Yeah.

23:04.440 --> 23:05.440
Yeah.

23:05.440 --> 23:06.440
Because that would take too much time.

23:06.440 --> 23:07.440
Do you know what his mantra is?

23:07.440 --> 23:08.440
What's that?

23:08.440 --> 23:09.440
Soros.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.440
Soros.

23:10.440 --> 23:11.440
Soros.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.440
Soros.

23:12.440 --> 23:13.440
I can't.

23:13.440 --> 23:14.440
I just can't imagine it.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.800
Like because he doesn't need to practice talking shit.

23:16.800 --> 23:17.880
He's really good at it.

23:17.880 --> 23:20.080
No, he's ecstatic at it.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.080
Yeah.

23:21.080 --> 23:23.720
He doesn't take time is preparing and he clearly doesn't do that.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.160
So I don't know.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.480
Anyway, this is not the end.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.520
It is a new chapter.

23:28.520 --> 23:34.600
So it's been the greatest pleasure of my life, 27 years on air, knowing all of you and fighting

23:34.600 --> 23:37.240
the new world order and doing all of this.

23:37.240 --> 23:41.200
And I'm not going anywhere yet, but you need to know a new chapters here.

23:41.200 --> 23:46.560
You know, when I tell you that the CIA follows us around and the FBI and the secret service

23:46.560 --> 23:50.640
now, and they come and sit down next to us at the restaurants and tell us that they come

23:50.640 --> 23:54.600
visit us at the hotel and turn our cell phones off so we can't videotape them.

23:54.600 --> 23:58.880
And that, you know, the former director of the CIA comes out and says he wants me arrested

23:58.880 --> 24:00.880
on Twitter.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.420
That isn't me scared.

24:02.420 --> 24:03.640
That's not me afraid.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.640
It's me lying.

24:04.640 --> 24:07.760
That's just InfoWars entering a new chapter of life.

24:07.760 --> 24:13.200
Embellishing probably more than lying because Michael Hayden did tweet an agreement with

24:13.200 --> 24:19.240
somebody who tweeted that Alex should be arrested for his statement about Biden at that rally

24:19.240 --> 24:20.240
over the weekend.

24:20.240 --> 24:21.240
Yeah.

24:21.240 --> 24:27.440
Um, yeah, I, I don't know the new chapter, what is a new chapter?

24:27.440 --> 24:28.440
What does that mean?

24:28.440 --> 24:29.440
What does that entail?

24:29.440 --> 24:34.960
And I, I, you can sum it up with a song title, no more, mr nice guy.

24:34.960 --> 24:41.440
And so I'm here to tell you that I'm not going to back down and I'm going to do exactly what

24:41.440 --> 24:44.280
I think is the most moral and best thing to do.

24:44.280 --> 24:55.360
And that starts with not being a nice guy anymore, not, not, not being delusional about

24:55.360 --> 25:01.920
where we stand and what we can do and the fact that I have this tendency to never even

25:01.920 --> 25:12.520
shake up things in my own operations because I'm so loyal, even though to the point of

25:12.520 --> 25:14.440
their operation, not being able to function.

25:14.440 --> 25:18.880
So up to this point, you'd been an mr nice guy.

25:18.880 --> 25:19.880
That speech.

25:19.880 --> 25:25.640
I can only hear that, like imagining him just giving it directly to the mirror as he's putting

25:25.640 --> 25:30.220
the joker makeup on, you know, like he's, he's just given this like, no more mr nice

25:30.220 --> 25:31.220
guy.

25:31.220 --> 25:32.220
All right.

25:32.220 --> 25:33.220
Put a little bit more rouge.

25:33.220 --> 25:36.400
The problem with me and the reason I've gotten to this point is I'm too loyal, too loyal.

25:36.400 --> 25:41.640
I've never met Wolfgang never met anybody.

25:41.640 --> 25:42.640
He's the crack.

25:42.640 --> 25:43.640
And who's cracking.

25:43.640 --> 25:44.640
We changed the crack.

25:44.640 --> 25:45.640
But Donnie didn't work here.

25:45.640 --> 25:46.640
I don't know that guy.

25:46.640 --> 25:47.640
Never heard of him.

25:47.640 --> 25:48.640
Never met him.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.480
So look, a lot of people are gone.

25:51.480 --> 25:56.600
And without mentioning David Knight by name, of course, there's some other people that

25:56.600 --> 26:00.880
you might've gotten used to seeing it in for us that aren't around anymore.

26:00.880 --> 26:04.080
And so I pledge to you that I'm going to work harder in the fight against the new world

26:04.080 --> 26:05.080
order.

26:05.080 --> 26:09.800
And I'm asking you to fight harder against the globalist, but I've already explained

26:09.800 --> 26:11.600
to you, we had to let Caitlin Bennett go.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.400
Cause we couldn't pay her anymore.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.920
We had to let Millie Weaver go and, and God bless Caitlin.

26:15.920 --> 26:19.440
She hasn't made up a bunch of stuff about us as we let her go.

26:19.440 --> 26:20.920
You've seen what Milly's done.

26:20.920 --> 26:21.920
God bless her.

26:21.920 --> 26:22.920
It's okay.

26:22.920 --> 26:23.920
She did a lot of great work in the past.

26:23.920 --> 26:24.920
No, she did not.

26:24.920 --> 26:25.920
No, no, no.

26:25.920 --> 26:30.120
I like the idea that Alex is trying to pretend that he didn't fire her for shadow gate.

26:30.120 --> 26:31.120
That's fun.

26:31.120 --> 26:32.120
Yeah.

26:32.120 --> 26:33.620
How could she make up all of this stuff?

26:33.620 --> 26:36.120
When I literally said, I don't get into that stuff.

26:36.120 --> 26:37.120
It's too scary.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.540
This is the gate of yeah.

26:38.540 --> 26:43.280
That weirdo guy from your film showed up at my studio and then was talking about Roger

26:43.280 --> 26:45.760
Stone in ways that I don't appreciate.

26:45.760 --> 26:46.760
You're fired.

26:46.760 --> 26:47.760
You're fired.

26:47.760 --> 26:48.760
You're fired.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.760
Oh, it was finances.

26:50.760 --> 26:51.760
Sure.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.520
I hate that she's making up that stuff.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.520
Yeah.

26:54.520 --> 26:59.040
But like, because of things in finances and the difficulties that Alex is in, the situation,

26:59.040 --> 27:02.680
he's had to cut back a whole bunch, you know, like there were people like Millie, there

27:02.680 --> 27:07.000
were people like Caitlin Bennett that he was funding and now he can't, he can't do that

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
anymore.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.320
But three, four years ago, when I still had plenty of money, I was funding dozens of organizations,

27:12.320 --> 27:14.040
dozens of groups that were doing great work.

27:14.040 --> 27:17.780
I was taking the money you sent us buying products and sending it out where I thought

27:17.780 --> 27:21.500
it was key to fight the new world order.

27:21.500 --> 27:27.640
I'm down to funding three or four organizations outside of our own operation now I've been

27:27.640 --> 27:33.440
cut back to a hill I'm on and I'll die on this hill.

27:33.440 --> 27:37.040
But everybody sits here and hears me say that you don't think I'm serious.

27:37.040 --> 27:41.940
So we're going to have to reorganize and we're going to have to rethink what we're doing.

27:41.940 --> 27:43.740
I'm going to stay on the air four hours a day.

27:43.740 --> 27:45.080
So was on for three hours a day.

27:45.080 --> 27:49.240
I've got a council, the nighttime election countdown show, just because there's not the

27:49.240 --> 27:50.240
crew.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.240
There's not the funds.

27:51.240 --> 27:52.240
There's not the money.

27:52.240 --> 27:55.540
And we're going to reorganize some of the other shows and then revamp them and relaunch

27:55.540 --> 28:03.680
them because I never give up, but I can give out second old horse, you know, horses will

28:03.680 --> 28:06.520
run and run and run until their heart blows up.

28:06.520 --> 28:07.520
Yeah.

28:07.520 --> 28:11.480
He's like a, he's like a horse, uh, with his, uh, with his heart, um, about to blow up.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.480
Yeah.

28:12.480 --> 28:13.480
Run, run faster.

28:13.480 --> 28:14.480
Keep going.

28:14.480 --> 28:19.480
So, um, from that clip, what I take away is the election countdown with Deanna Lorraine

28:19.480 --> 28:21.480
and Robert Barnes over.

28:21.480 --> 28:22.480
That's gone.

28:22.480 --> 28:23.480
There's no staff for that.

28:23.480 --> 28:24.480
Fuck it.

28:24.480 --> 28:25.480
Sorry.

28:25.480 --> 28:26.480
Barnes.

28:26.480 --> 28:27.480
Alex is going to be on still and Owen.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.480
Yeah.

28:28.480 --> 28:32.040
Conspicuous in its absence from that list is the only other show and that's the David Knight

28:32.040 --> 28:33.040
show.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.040
Well, there's that one.

28:34.040 --> 28:38.920
So you're going to retool and revamp these shows, but obviously the, you know, according

28:38.920 --> 28:41.320
to David Knight's Twitter, he got fired.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.800
So you're going to revamp it with somebody else, I guess.

28:43.800 --> 28:44.800
Uh, yeah, probably.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.760
Uh, he wants to bring in a younger crowd.

28:46.760 --> 28:50.880
So, you know, 11 or 12 year old video game streamer is probably who he's going to hit

28:50.880 --> 28:51.880
things with hammers.

28:51.880 --> 28:52.880
Exactly.

28:52.880 --> 28:53.880
Yeah.

28:53.880 --> 28:54.880
Yeah.

28:54.880 --> 28:55.880
He's electric.

28:55.880 --> 28:58.200
Harrison Smith is probably the best they have there.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.200
And that's bad.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.200
Yeah.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.200
That's not good.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.200
Really bad.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.200
No, no, no.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.200
No, no, no.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.200
Uh, you can wear shades.

29:05.200 --> 29:08.520
Uh, you don't need to actually.

29:08.520 --> 29:15.240
So, um, like, uh, I, I think that this metaphor too is a little bit rough and I don't appreciate

29:15.240 --> 29:16.240
it.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.520
Alex talking about, you know, you can, you're a horse and you're just running until your

29:18.520 --> 29:19.520
heart gives out.

29:19.520 --> 29:24.480
David Knight had a heart attack last year and then he came back to work because he was

29:24.480 --> 29:27.040
so passionate about this shit.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.040
That's very funny.

29:28.040 --> 29:31.120
Like, like I don't look, I don't want to be this guy.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.120
Sure.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.400
Like giving a shit when it's not my time to give a shit.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.400
Sure.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.080
But like David Knight gave a lot to this.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.080
He did.

29:39.080 --> 29:42.040
And we are now a couple of weeks before Christmas.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.040
Uh huh.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.760
Alex is fucking firing him.

29:44.760 --> 29:45.760
Yeah, absolutely.

29:45.760 --> 29:46.760
That's so bad.

29:46.760 --> 29:47.760
Ah, come on.

29:47.760 --> 29:48.760
That's so shitty.

29:48.760 --> 29:49.760
Come on.

29:49.760 --> 29:53.080
Everybody was like, Oh, feel bad for Bob Cratchit.

29:53.080 --> 29:58.400
What did, when did they think about how Scrooge was like a fucking horse who was going to

29:58.400 --> 30:01.200
steal everybody's money until his heart gave out?

30:01.200 --> 30:03.160
Nobody's thinking about Scrooge here.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.160
Okay.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.160
This is dirty man.

30:05.160 --> 30:06.840
He's doing him dirty.

30:06.840 --> 30:08.960
He couldn't wait until the new year.

30:08.960 --> 30:09.960
What?

30:09.960 --> 30:15.840
God, I just, I just want, I just hope that David Knight is overwhelmed by not like sadness

30:15.840 --> 30:22.520
or regret or like anything other than just like, I am so stupid for coming back after

30:22.520 --> 30:23.520
that fucking heart attack.

30:23.520 --> 30:24.520
Well.

30:24.520 --> 30:25.720
I should never have fucking done that.

30:25.720 --> 30:29.320
I have a slightly different hope and that is that I hope it gets ugly.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.320
Like yeah, I do too.

30:30.320 --> 30:34.680
Not for his like, uh, like nothing negative for him or anything, but like, I hope he kept

30:34.680 --> 30:35.680
some receipts.

30:35.680 --> 30:36.680
Oh yeah.

30:36.680 --> 30:37.680
For sure.

30:37.680 --> 30:39.360
I hope there's some, uh, real fun.

30:39.360 --> 30:40.360
Oh yeah.

30:40.360 --> 30:47.040
Uh, but hey, look, uh, Alex is this horse and he's running and he needs a break.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.840
Any good horse will run till its heart blows.

30:48.840 --> 30:49.840
It won't stop.

30:49.840 --> 30:52.520
You keep running a horse, it'll go till it dies.

30:52.520 --> 30:59.600
And um, you know, I've met a physically, but also physically got to that point.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.240
I can't stop working.

31:01.240 --> 31:03.520
I've got to take a week off.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.040
I've got to turn everything off.

31:05.040 --> 31:07.000
I've got to do it.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.240
And it doesn't matter where the middle of the shine battle because I know when smokes

31:10.240 --> 31:14.000
coming out of the race car engine, you got to pull over and get it, get it, get it oil

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
put in there.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Yeah.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
You got to put some oil in there.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Sure.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Yeah.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
You got to take a week off Alex.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
We got to put oil in the horse.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
You just went to DC.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.800
You just took a, took a trip to DC.

31:25.800 --> 31:26.800
That was work.

31:26.800 --> 31:27.800
That was work.

31:27.800 --> 31:28.800
That was work related.

31:28.800 --> 31:29.800
Yeah.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.360
I mean, he stayed in a nice hotel and ate really well, but he should have gone with

31:32.360 --> 31:33.360
Owen on the caravan.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.360
That would have been a fun road trip.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.360
That would have been a nice time.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.360
That would have been a nice time.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.360
That would have been a nice time.

31:37.360 --> 31:38.360
That would have been a nice time.

31:38.360 --> 31:39.360
You guys could have bro-ed out.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.360
Work-cation.

31:40.360 --> 31:41.360
Bonded.

31:41.360 --> 31:42.360
Yeah.

31:42.360 --> 31:43.360
The whole thing.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.360
Yeah.

31:44.360 --> 31:45.360
Uh, take a, take a week off Alex, please.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.360
Yeah.

31:46.360 --> 31:49.240
Uh, so I was wondering like, what's the, this clip confused the hell out of me because Alex

31:49.240 --> 31:51.600
describes what his last straw was.

31:51.600 --> 31:52.600
Okay.

31:52.600 --> 31:53.600
And it's something that doesn't make any sense.

31:53.600 --> 31:57.480
And so I thank you all for your support and I love you and I appreciate you.

31:57.480 --> 32:01.940
Uh, and I, and I, the last straw was this morning I got up and I saw this number, black

32:01.940 --> 32:06.320
lives matter raised 10.6 billion since may.

32:06.320 --> 32:09.600
When you go in a coffee shop like Starbucks or anywhere and they say, give it a black

32:09.600 --> 32:10.600
lives matter.

32:10.600 --> 32:13.400
That's just the communists and the globalists and Soros collecting money.

32:13.400 --> 32:16.000
The DNC on record got 4 billion out of it.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.720
Of the 10 billion last time I checked, look how much the DNC got of that.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.040
That was a few months ago.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.440
That was 4 billion that I'd read.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.360
They'd gotten who knows what it is now.

32:24.360 --> 32:28.280
Um, that's all just miss, uh, misinterpretations of the act blue stuff.

32:28.280 --> 32:33.440
But um, yeah, I don't know why black lives matter getting a certain amount of money would

32:33.440 --> 32:38.880
be the last straw for him in cause it doesn't materially affect what he's doing at all.

32:38.880 --> 32:42.680
No, if I understand correctly, I wrote this down as I was tracking the thought.

32:42.680 --> 32:43.680
All right.

32:43.680 --> 32:54.280
So I wrote down first BLM raised 10 billion and then so I fired David Knight.

32:54.280 --> 32:57.440
Is that the, is that the if then statement that I think we're going for here?

32:57.440 --> 32:59.240
Cause I feel like that's what he's saying.

32:59.240 --> 33:03.200
There's a weird feeling of it, but I think if you distill it down even more, it's like,

33:03.200 --> 33:09.580
I saw that black lives matter made $10 billion and I'm not making close to that and it pisses

33:09.580 --> 33:10.580
me off.

33:10.580 --> 33:11.580
Yeah.

33:11.580 --> 33:16.800
So I'm going to fire David Knight and uh, Deanna Lorraine and well, she might've been

33:16.800 --> 33:20.040
like, I always got the sense that she was just kind of like a temp.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.040
She's an independent contractor.

33:22.040 --> 33:25.440
She was there on a little bit of a assignment or whatever.

33:25.440 --> 33:26.440
She got a cup of coffee.

33:26.440 --> 33:27.440
Yeah.

33:27.440 --> 33:30.760
She wasn't there for any kind of long term thing.

33:30.760 --> 33:33.120
I just, uh, yeah, I don't know.

33:33.120 --> 33:38.120
I'm very conflicted because there's two sides of this that I think of.

33:38.120 --> 33:43.540
One is like the, uh, David Knight had run afoul of Steve Pachannik in a very serious

33:43.540 --> 33:44.540
way.

33:44.540 --> 33:48.000
And that is something that is hard to have in house.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Right.

33:49.000 --> 33:54.280
If you have somebody who is your intro show on your network right before you, who's saying

33:54.280 --> 33:58.680
that one of your experts is a piece of shit liar, that's hard.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.840
That's going to be tough to maintain the status quo.

34:00.840 --> 34:01.840
Right.

34:01.840 --> 34:06.340
And you're a media outlet that is built entirely around bombast.

34:06.340 --> 34:11.120
So it seems fairly simple to be like, okay, well we've got the most boring man ever and

34:11.120 --> 34:14.320
we've got the most bombastic liar ever.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.520
I think we're going to go with the most bombastic liar.

34:16.520 --> 34:17.520
Yeah.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.520
Yeah.

34:18.520 --> 34:24.440
I think we're going to really have a whole lot of stability in, um, uh, keeping th keeping

34:24.440 --> 34:32.040
people in like unengaged, I guess, engaged, unengaged because you want people actively

34:32.040 --> 34:35.200
consuming your material, but you don't want them engaging with it.

34:35.200 --> 34:36.200
Right.

34:36.200 --> 34:39.040
And having David Knight be like, uh, Steve Pachannik's a fucking liar.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.040
Yeah.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.040
Then you have to stop.

34:41.040 --> 34:44.320
Why does, why does David Knight think that he's a liar?

34:44.320 --> 34:45.320
Yeah.

34:45.320 --> 34:48.160
And you can't, but why doesn't Alex not?

34:48.160 --> 34:54.200
You know, it's too complicated and you run the risk of, uh, uh, kickstarting, like critical

34:54.200 --> 34:55.200
thinking in your listeners.

34:55.200 --> 34:56.200
And that's no good.

34:56.200 --> 34:57.200
Yeah.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.200
Yeah.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.200
I can't have that.

34:59.200 --> 35:00.200
Absolutely not.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.200
Stick with Pachannik.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.200
But it does seem like that was a little bit ago.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.200
That was a couple of weeks ago.

35:03.200 --> 35:08.040
Like I don't, I don't know if I could draw a causal link here.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.640
And Alex is saying that it's because of money.

35:10.640 --> 35:11.640
Sure.

35:11.640 --> 35:17.120
Now the only things that are gone are the, uh, night show, which obviously sucked the

35:17.120 --> 35:20.180
evening show that no one cared about.

35:20.180 --> 35:24.640
They canceled when Alex went to DC because they didn't have the crew to run it anyway.

35:24.640 --> 35:29.340
That was already like a secondary tertiary thought for them.

35:29.340 --> 35:34.840
And then David Knight's show, it very easily could be monetary budget constraints, but

35:34.840 --> 35:38.920
I can also see a possible world where Alex was like, fuck, I got to get rid of David

35:38.920 --> 35:39.920
Knight.

35:39.920 --> 35:40.920
It's just not working out.

35:40.920 --> 35:42.920
This is an untenable situation.

35:42.920 --> 35:44.720
How can we fundraise on that?

35:44.720 --> 35:50.800
How can I drive sales with getting rid of David Knight?

35:50.800 --> 35:51.800
I don't know.

35:51.800 --> 35:54.080
I can't, I have no fucking idea.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.660
None of it seems good.

35:55.660 --> 35:59.200
Like none of it seems like this is a, no, I wouldn't look at any of these circumstances

35:59.200 --> 36:02.920
and be like, I'm going to invest in this business.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.560
This business's model looks good.

36:04.560 --> 36:08.720
I'm going to wait until it hits rock bottom first, then I might invest in it.

36:08.720 --> 36:10.240
But right now it's only going down.

36:10.240 --> 36:11.560
Well that might be soon.

36:11.560 --> 36:17.880
That's unclear because a last clip here from the 17th, Alex kind of implies that the Christmas

36:17.880 --> 36:21.360
sale will determine the future of InfoWars.

36:21.360 --> 36:27.640
Just do your Christmas shopping at infoawarsstore.com and we'll expand, but if you don't, we'll contract.

36:27.640 --> 36:33.800
And so we're reassessing right now and InfoWars is contracting ahead of a big offensive.

36:33.800 --> 36:38.640
Now I'm going to decide whether it's our big last offensive or just the next of many, but

36:38.640 --> 36:45.960
I promise you this, we'll go out in a fiery inferno of liberty in a peaceful operation

36:45.960 --> 36:46.960
of total victory.

36:46.960 --> 36:47.960
Peaceful.

36:47.960 --> 36:48.960
Peaceful.

36:48.960 --> 36:49.960
Peaceful.

36:49.960 --> 36:54.140
I did say offensive a couple of times there in a fiery blaze of, but it's peaceful.

36:54.140 --> 36:55.140
It's all peaceful.

36:55.140 --> 36:56.140
Don't worry.

36:56.140 --> 37:02.320
I would like one last image of InfoWars to be Alex standing in the studio as everything

37:02.320 --> 37:07.160
burns around him with his arms outstretched, his head facing and screaming into the sky.

37:07.160 --> 37:08.960
I think that's how he's got to go out.

37:08.960 --> 37:09.960
Sure.

37:09.960 --> 37:10.960
Right?

37:10.960 --> 37:11.960
That last image.

37:11.960 --> 37:12.960
I don't want him to actually be burnt alive.

37:12.960 --> 37:13.960
Like in a movie.

37:13.960 --> 37:14.960
Yeah.

37:14.960 --> 37:15.960
Like in a movie.

37:15.960 --> 37:16.960
It would be a fitting arc.

37:16.960 --> 37:21.520
Like Gary Oldman in The Professional whenever his eyes are all bloodshot and he's screaming

37:21.520 --> 37:22.520
to this guy.

37:22.520 --> 37:23.520
Yeah.

37:23.520 --> 37:26.920
So actually I'm going to play this last clip here from the 17th.

37:26.920 --> 37:31.540
I have one more, but it's just sort of like indicative of like me losing my patience with

37:31.540 --> 37:37.040
Alex and why we're going to now jump back to the 16th to see what things were like 24

37:37.040 --> 37:42.440
hours prior to Alex spending the beginning of his show talking about how dire shit is

37:42.440 --> 37:44.540
and David Knight's fired.

37:44.540 --> 37:49.300
So I like Andres Manuel Lopez Ormidor.

37:49.300 --> 37:54.240
He's a socialist, but he is a real socialist.

37:54.240 --> 37:58.800
And by that, I mean, he's a popular socialist and is actually trying to get higher wages

37:58.800 --> 38:02.400
for people and trying to get corporations to actually not be tax exempt.

38:02.400 --> 38:06.880
I don't agree with that model long term, but so Alex, what the fuck does that mean?

38:06.880 --> 38:12.220
Alex has decided that he likes the president of Mexico because there were some comments

38:12.220 --> 38:15.320
about COVID precautions that Alex enjoyed.

38:15.320 --> 38:16.680
And so now I like him now.

38:16.680 --> 38:18.840
He's a socialist, but he's a real socialist.

38:18.840 --> 38:19.840
Whatever.

38:19.840 --> 38:20.840
You should hate him more.

38:20.840 --> 38:21.840
Fuck off.

38:21.840 --> 38:22.840
You should hate him more.

38:22.840 --> 38:23.840
That's the thing that you hate most.

38:23.840 --> 38:27.640
You hate people who don't understand socialism, who think that, God, I hate it.

38:27.640 --> 38:31.040
You hate people who you decide are socialists.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.040
Exactly.

38:32.040 --> 38:33.040
Yeah.

38:33.040 --> 38:37.840
And so we jumped back to the 16th to see like, are there any signs?

38:37.840 --> 38:42.080
Are there any indications that we can get from the 16th that like just a day later?

38:42.080 --> 38:44.000
Hey, everybody, it's December 16th.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
I gotta be honest.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.760
We've never had more money than we have right now.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.320
We're just so fucking flush.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.660
Anyways, we'll see how it goes tomorrow.

38:51.660 --> 38:56.800
So we start with Alex, the exciting and interesting source.

38:56.800 --> 39:02.160
America and the rest of the world is under globalist, big tech siege, a corporate planetary

39:02.160 --> 39:08.840
takeover to replace humans and to make us obsolete.

39:08.840 --> 39:14.280
The Von Mies Institute is highly respected.

39:14.280 --> 39:19.240
With some of the top academics, researchers, economists in the world, they've come out

39:19.240 --> 39:28.480
with a big article that's on Infowars.com where they say this is a dystopic, big tech

39:28.480 --> 39:34.040
bio slash digital technocracy.

39:34.040 --> 39:37.240
The Mies Institute is not a super well respected.

39:37.240 --> 39:38.600
They're like hardcore libertarian.

39:38.600 --> 39:39.600
No, no, no.

39:39.600 --> 39:43.720
We've talked about the Mies Institute in the past and if I recall, my feeling on them was

39:43.720 --> 39:44.720
they're great.

39:44.720 --> 39:50.240
One of the articles that I covered from their website was a defense of not feeding your

39:50.240 --> 39:54.760
children because you don't have positive responsibilities towards people.

39:54.760 --> 39:55.760
Exactly.

39:55.760 --> 39:56.760
It's like, oh, great.

39:56.760 --> 39:57.760
Yeah.

39:57.760 --> 39:58.760
They're also libertarians.

39:58.760 --> 39:59.760
Yeah.

39:59.760 --> 40:03.760
They're also that kind of libertarian that's just a shit head.

40:03.760 --> 40:07.460
Like if you're writing the in defense of not feeding your own kids, you're just a shit

40:07.460 --> 40:08.460
head.

40:08.460 --> 40:09.460
Get out of this Mies Institute bullshit.

40:09.460 --> 40:11.960
You're also not going to not feed your child.

40:11.960 --> 40:12.960
Of course not.

40:12.960 --> 40:14.960
You're doing this as some kind of a weird mental intellectual masturbation.

40:14.960 --> 40:15.960
Yeah.

40:15.960 --> 40:16.960
It's a shit head thing to do.

40:16.960 --> 40:17.960
Yeah.

40:17.960 --> 40:18.960
Totally.

40:18.960 --> 40:19.960
Totally.

40:19.960 --> 40:22.360
But Alex, not too long ago, was talking about how being a libertarian was the stupidest

40:22.360 --> 40:23.360
thing he's ever done.

40:23.360 --> 40:24.360
The dumbest thing you could do.

40:24.360 --> 40:25.360
And now he's citing the Mies Institute.

40:25.360 --> 40:29.720
Well, they're great, but they're real libertarians, Dan, and that's the smartest thing you can

40:29.720 --> 40:30.720
be.

40:30.720 --> 40:31.720
Anyway, Barnes.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.480
His show is canceled now.

40:33.480 --> 40:34.480
Good.

40:34.480 --> 40:35.480
But, Alex-

40:35.480 --> 40:36.480
24 hours earlier-

40:36.480 --> 40:40.560
We have constitutional lawyer, Robert Barnes, who will shoot you straight on where Trump

40:40.560 --> 40:41.560
really stands.

40:41.560 --> 40:45.280
I can tell you he's in liaison with the White House, even though he doesn't want that known.

40:45.280 --> 40:47.800
I can tell you that.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.200
Why can you tell me that?

40:49.200 --> 40:50.880
Because separately, I know the White House doesn't even care now.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.000
The White House doesn't care.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
That's why.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.680
If he doesn't want that known-

40:54.680 --> 40:56.320
Yeah.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.720
Why would you tell me that?

40:57.720 --> 41:01.480
Hey, look, this is private, but Barnes is working with the President.

41:01.480 --> 41:02.480
He told me not to tell you.

41:02.480 --> 41:04.480
He doesn't want me to tell you.

41:04.480 --> 41:08.800
But the White House is- okay, so the White House is finally- but you know Barnes.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.280
And he personally asked you.

41:10.280 --> 41:11.560
And now there's no show.

41:11.560 --> 41:14.660
The Evening Countdown show is canceled.

41:14.660 --> 41:19.200
But there's no indication of that from Alex on the 16th.

41:19.200 --> 41:24.600
There is no sense that, like, Barnes has been doing this show, it's gonna come to an end.

41:24.600 --> 41:25.600
Sure.

41:25.600 --> 41:26.600
It seems abrupt.

41:26.600 --> 41:27.600
Yeah, it does seem pretty abrupt.

41:27.600 --> 41:28.960
It seems abrupt.

41:28.960 --> 41:31.800
Speaking of which, this seemed abrupt.

41:31.800 --> 41:37.800
But here's the big news we're gonna cover at the start of the next segment.

41:37.800 --> 41:41.920
Mitch McConnell and his wife, like a lot of Republicans, have been on the Communist Chinese

41:41.920 --> 41:43.200
payroll for a long time.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.200
Oh no.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.200
Sure.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.200
Sure.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.640
Let's remember that Mitch McConnell's bad finally.

41:47.640 --> 41:51.000
It's been so long since we've remembered how many people are bad, Dan.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.240
Yep, Mitch McConnell has recognized that Biden won the election, and now-

41:55.240 --> 41:58.000
So it turns out I remember all these things about him.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.920
Or I'm just gonna make out that he's a Chinese agent.

41:59.920 --> 42:00.920
Yeah, well.

42:00.920 --> 42:01.920
Yeah.

42:01.920 --> 42:02.920
Yeah, so that's great.

42:02.920 --> 42:03.920
That's great stuff.

42:03.920 --> 42:04.920
Now he's a villain.

42:04.920 --> 42:05.920
I like it.

42:05.920 --> 42:06.920
Absolutely, Alex.

42:06.920 --> 42:07.920
McConnell is a villain.

42:07.920 --> 42:08.920
Go after him!

42:08.920 --> 42:11.440
So the knives are out, folks, and- Hell yeah!

42:11.440 --> 42:15.240
There's no doubt that Mitch McConnell is a super bad dude.

42:15.240 --> 42:16.720
A bad bad- Get him!

42:16.720 --> 42:21.440
And we told you Amy Cohen, Barrett, and we told you Kavanaugh, and we told you all that

42:21.440 --> 42:24.040
they were going to betray us.

42:24.040 --> 42:25.520
What?

42:25.520 --> 42:27.920
Because they come out of the swamp.

42:27.920 --> 42:28.920
What?

42:28.920 --> 42:29.920
What?

42:29.920 --> 42:30.920
Yep.

42:30.920 --> 42:36.400
You told them that the only reason to stick with Trump was so he could get those people

42:36.400 --> 42:37.400
in.

42:37.400 --> 42:38.400
Yeah.

42:38.400 --> 42:39.400
Why didn't you bring up Gorsuch?

42:39.400 --> 42:41.040
Also- Oh, Gorsuch is too long ago.

42:41.040 --> 42:43.320
Alex was like crying- And that one's still stolen.

42:43.320 --> 42:44.320
About Kavanaugh.

42:44.320 --> 42:45.680
He was all about Kavanaugh.

42:45.680 --> 42:47.840
This is the moment we've been waiting for.

42:47.840 --> 42:50.720
Alex was so in favor of that, as if he was Squee himself.

42:50.720 --> 42:53.720
This is the culmination of everything we've worked for.

42:53.720 --> 42:59.040
It was a little more confusing, the Barrett nomination, because you did have Barnes coming

42:59.040 --> 43:03.340
in and saying, this is a really bad idea, they shouldn't go this route, and Alex having

43:03.340 --> 43:06.960
to dance around, but he did support her nomination.

43:06.960 --> 43:07.960
Yeah.

43:07.960 --> 43:08.960
He was in favor of it.

43:08.960 --> 43:09.960
We like Catholics.

43:09.960 --> 43:10.960
No, we don't like Catholics.

43:10.960 --> 43:12.240
Oh, well, I guess we don't like Catholics.

43:12.240 --> 43:15.000
Somebody else is like, I think she's great, and Alex is like, ah, I think she's great

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
too.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Moving on.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
But they're all villains now, man.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Yeah.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Good.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
We got a lot of new villains for Alex.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
Love it.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.960
Fight amongst yourselves, I want to make you hurt each other more.

43:23.960 --> 43:29.400
So Roger Stone, not too long ago, came on and broke some gigantic news.

43:29.400 --> 43:30.400
Yeah.

43:30.400 --> 43:31.400
North Korea.

43:31.400 --> 43:32.400
Yeah.

43:32.400 --> 43:33.400
Boats.

43:33.400 --> 43:34.400
Yep.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.400
Maine.

43:35.400 --> 43:36.400
Boats, from North Korea.

43:36.400 --> 43:37.400
Arrived.

43:37.400 --> 43:38.400
With ballots.

43:38.400 --> 43:39.400
Sailed, with ballots, to Maine.

43:39.400 --> 43:40.400
Arrived in Maine.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.400
Maine?

43:41.400 --> 43:42.400
United States, Maine.

43:42.400 --> 43:43.800
Apparently there's a different situation.

43:43.800 --> 43:45.640
Oh, did something else happen?

43:45.640 --> 43:51.720
McConnell warns GOP of electoral college brawl in Congress.

43:51.720 --> 43:53.360
Trump's got his electors.

43:53.360 --> 43:54.360
They've seated theirs.

43:54.360 --> 43:56.440
They lock the real electors out of the state houses.

43:56.440 --> 43:59.400
We're just supposed to just go along with this and not let the president and the voters

43:59.400 --> 44:02.480
of America press their attacks.

44:02.480 --> 44:04.680
Yes, they've gotten screwed to legislatures.

44:04.680 --> 44:08.760
Yes, they've been screwed so far by most of the governors because they're all a bunch

44:08.760 --> 44:09.760
of cowards.

44:09.760 --> 44:13.800
But when you get down to the brass tacks, you see mathematics that are impossible in

44:13.800 --> 44:18.580
all those states where Trump's winning by two, three, four, five, six points.

44:18.580 --> 44:22.800
And then as soon as they, quote, close the polls, all these trucks pull up, food delivery

44:22.800 --> 44:23.800
vehicles, you name it.

44:23.800 --> 44:27.800
Chinese men mainly run in with these big containers of ballots.

44:27.800 --> 44:31.520
And then inside we have the footage of the workers and they're cramming it in as fast

44:31.520 --> 44:32.520
as they can.

44:32.520 --> 44:36.200
And then you have the Chinese government planes landing the day of.

44:36.200 --> 44:37.200
Wait, what now?

44:37.200 --> 44:38.200
You have the charter numbers.

44:38.200 --> 44:43.480
I mean, private jets flying out of China, landing men running in with big boxes of ballots.

44:43.480 --> 44:49.000
So now the Chinese government is sending their own planes with charter numbers and arriving

44:49.000 --> 44:51.120
with ballots on election day.

44:51.120 --> 44:53.600
So is this an addition to the North Korean boats?

44:53.600 --> 44:54.600
Okay.

44:54.600 --> 44:56.960
So is the North Korean boat like a backup?

44:56.960 --> 44:57.960
Could be.

44:57.960 --> 45:03.720
You know, like they're like, okay, we'll send the boats in like March of this year and China's

45:03.720 --> 45:05.840
going to have the plan to airlift them in and everything.

45:05.840 --> 45:09.960
But when, but hey, worst comes to worst, the boats will be in Maine in November.

45:09.960 --> 45:11.080
Here's what I'm thinking.

45:11.080 --> 45:16.960
I'm thinking that the Chinese planes brought in ballots, like boxes of ballots for Biden,

45:16.960 --> 45:17.960
right?

45:17.960 --> 45:18.960
Okay.

45:18.960 --> 45:20.920
Now the North Korean boats were rogue.

45:20.920 --> 45:21.920
They were crazy.

45:21.920 --> 45:23.920
They were for Jorgensen.

45:23.920 --> 45:24.920
Jorgensen.

45:24.920 --> 45:25.920
Okay.

45:25.920 --> 45:26.920
It's all Jorgensen?

45:26.920 --> 45:27.920
They were going libertarian.

45:27.920 --> 45:29.320
Straight libertarian, down ballot.

45:29.320 --> 45:35.560
Are we sure these weren't ballots for the 2016 election and the North Koreans just got

45:35.560 --> 45:36.560
to Maine?

45:36.560 --> 45:37.560
That would make more sense.

45:37.560 --> 45:38.560
Is it all for Ron Johnson?

45:38.560 --> 45:39.560
Yeah.

45:39.560 --> 45:40.760
That would make more sense.

45:40.760 --> 45:42.040
That would make more sense.

45:42.040 --> 45:48.880
So yeah, I just feel like this is silly and I'm going to need a lot more proof of this,

45:48.880 --> 45:50.760
which Alex is not forthcoming with.

45:50.760 --> 45:51.760
That's unsurprising.

45:51.760 --> 45:54.840
But something that is also not surprising.

45:54.840 --> 45:55.840
What's that?

45:55.840 --> 45:56.840
Alex wants a do-over.

45:56.840 --> 46:02.360
Second Senator leans towards objecting to Electoral College certification.

46:02.360 --> 46:03.360
Yes.

46:03.360 --> 46:09.320
Told you Rand Paul's a man of honor.

46:09.320 --> 46:11.680
That's what we need for president in four years.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.400
Get the fuck out of here.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.880
Pence, Paul, Paul, Pence ticket will be good.

46:15.880 --> 46:16.880
Okay.

46:16.880 --> 46:17.880
All right.

46:17.880 --> 46:18.880
Wow.

46:18.880 --> 46:19.880
Yeah.

46:19.880 --> 46:20.880
Wow.

46:20.880 --> 46:21.880
Paul Pence.

46:21.880 --> 46:22.880
Paul Pence.

46:22.880 --> 46:23.880
That would really inspire the masses.

46:23.880 --> 46:24.880
Those two boring ass...

46:24.880 --> 46:25.880
Those two dim shits.

46:25.880 --> 46:26.880
Yeah.

46:26.880 --> 46:27.880
Oh my God.

46:27.880 --> 46:28.880
Yeah.

46:28.880 --> 46:29.880
You want Rand Paul back.

46:29.880 --> 46:30.880
Oh, how fun.

46:30.880 --> 46:31.880
How interesting.

46:31.880 --> 46:36.360
Pence can't be president because nobody wants to live in a world where we have to call his

46:36.360 --> 46:37.880
wife the first mother.

46:37.880 --> 46:39.120
That's just not happening.

46:39.120 --> 46:40.120
It's just not happening.

46:40.120 --> 46:42.640
And Rand Paul, like you had your chance, Alex.

46:42.640 --> 46:44.320
You turned your back on him for Trump.

46:44.320 --> 46:45.320
You know that.

46:45.320 --> 46:46.320
Yep.

46:46.320 --> 46:47.320
It's over.

46:47.320 --> 46:48.320
We all watched that happen.

46:48.320 --> 46:49.320
Oh yeah.

46:49.320 --> 46:52.000
Rand isn't like Joe Rogan where you can turn your back on him and he'll accept you once

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
more.

46:53.000 --> 46:57.280
No, I know because he refuses to debate me and that's the only thing that makes sense.

46:57.280 --> 47:04.600
So Robert Barnes, a host for another couple hours of the election countdown is on and

47:04.600 --> 47:08.600
he wants you to know that he also thinks that Mitch McConnell is a traitor.

47:08.600 --> 47:13.360
So the fact is it leads an inference that well, all along, these were people who were

47:13.360 --> 47:18.440
undermining the president and now it's like the Godfather line when the Marlon Brando's

47:18.440 --> 47:21.540
character says he should have seen it was that one guy all along.

47:21.540 --> 47:25.740
It was Mitch McConnell all along betraying and undermining and sabotaging the president.

47:25.740 --> 47:26.740
It's not a coincidence.

47:26.740 --> 47:31.800
It was his attorney general in Kentucky who was the only one to refuse to speak out or

47:31.800 --> 47:33.540
join the Texas lawsuit.

47:33.540 --> 47:37.560
So now the president knows that these were traitors in his own house all along.

47:37.560 --> 47:40.240
Trump's called basically for the arrest of the governor of Georgia.

47:40.240 --> 47:41.240
I mean these people are criminals.

47:41.240 --> 47:42.240
We need to get...

47:42.240 --> 47:43.240
Yeah, I want that too.

47:43.240 --> 47:44.240
Let's talk about Trump.

47:44.240 --> 47:46.160
What Trump should do, where Trump's really at, where we're at.

47:46.160 --> 47:48.960
So Mitch McConnell was screwing it up the whole time.

47:48.960 --> 47:52.560
He was the, uh, the, uh, the, the traitor behind the scenes.

47:52.560 --> 47:53.560
Okay.

47:53.560 --> 47:54.560
All right.

47:54.560 --> 48:00.440
If you want to try and pull that now after this long, after this long, then either you

48:00.440 --> 48:04.640
have to shut up forever because everything that you've told me, if Mitch McConnell's

48:04.640 --> 48:10.080
the secret bad guy the whole time, he was there, right there, he's there, he's right

48:10.080 --> 48:11.080
there.

48:11.080 --> 48:12.080
There's no deep state.

48:12.080 --> 48:13.080
He was, he's in your face.

48:13.080 --> 48:14.080
Yeah.

48:14.080 --> 48:15.080
You know?

48:15.080 --> 48:16.080
Yeah.

48:16.080 --> 48:17.240
And it's, um, I don't know.

48:17.240 --> 48:22.480
It's trying too hard to make an interesting plot twist, I think, and I am not going to

48:22.480 --> 48:28.240
go along for this, this ride and I pity, I pity anybody who does, but you see this, like

48:28.240 --> 48:34.840
there are just like shoring up of ranks of like the people who are, uh, blindly willing

48:34.840 --> 48:39.680
to just completely throw away any kind of semblance of dignity that they have for Trump.

48:39.680 --> 48:40.680
Yeah.

48:40.680 --> 48:41.680
They're good.

48:41.680 --> 48:42.680
Yeah.

48:42.680 --> 48:43.680
Everybody else.

48:43.680 --> 48:44.680
Oh, they were secretly villains.

48:44.680 --> 48:45.680
Evil.

48:45.680 --> 48:46.680
And I have bad news for you.

48:46.680 --> 48:47.680
What's that?

48:47.680 --> 48:48.680
That Pence-Paul ticket might not be happening after all.

48:48.680 --> 48:49.680
Oh no.

48:49.680 --> 48:53.600
It's not that Pence is truly loyal to Trump during Access Hollywood, Pence was trying

48:53.600 --> 48:58.060
to navigate Trump out so that he could be top of the ticket in 2016.

48:58.060 --> 49:00.720
It was Pence who helped drive Flynn out.

49:00.720 --> 49:06.680
It was Pence who helped negotiate with Ecuador to get Julian Assange arrested and extradited.

49:06.680 --> 49:11.020
So Pence has not been a real Trump ally in a lot of the never Trumpers and problem people

49:11.020 --> 49:15.080
have come from Pence's group of people and his staff in the white house.

49:15.080 --> 49:17.400
Oh, it looks like Pence is an enemy too.

49:17.400 --> 49:18.400
Good.

49:18.400 --> 49:19.400
Good.

49:19.400 --> 49:20.400
Yeah.

49:20.400 --> 49:21.400
They're all enemies.

49:21.400 --> 49:27.240
Arrest the governor of Georgia, veto the defense bill, tear this whole place down around your

49:27.240 --> 49:28.240
ears.

49:28.240 --> 49:31.240
No, let's not do that.

49:31.240 --> 49:33.000
It's just a little much.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.080
It's a little much.

49:34.080 --> 49:40.080
It's a little cartoonish the way they're like defining good and bad people now.

49:40.080 --> 49:47.320
I think it's, it's really just sad though, because it's, it's like you, you obviously

49:47.320 --> 49:49.360
weren't actually fooled.

49:49.360 --> 49:52.760
There's no possible way that you could be fooled by that shit.

49:52.760 --> 49:56.000
You had to have known that they were lying the whole time and that they didn't really

49:56.000 --> 49:59.720
like Trump because Trump's a fucking lunatic and they're all career politicians.

49:59.720 --> 50:00.720
Right.

50:00.720 --> 50:01.720
Right?

50:01.720 --> 50:02.720
Yeah.

50:02.720 --> 50:03.720
But this is the payoff of that.

50:03.720 --> 50:10.320
If you don't know that, then, oh, that's just so sad, especially because I've been telling

50:10.320 --> 50:12.400
you that for my entire life.

50:12.400 --> 50:17.440
And it is, it's, it's, it's really interesting for me in particular to see like the, the

50:17.440 --> 50:23.920
turning on people so bluntly and so stupidly, like Bill Barr was, he went back and forth

50:23.920 --> 50:24.920
a number of times.

50:24.920 --> 50:25.920
Oh yeah.

50:25.920 --> 50:29.000
And now we have Barnes coming in here saying that everyone's an enemy.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah, yeah.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.560
Bill Barr was a, Bill Barr was a yo-yo for a while and now he's permanently walking the

50:33.560 --> 50:34.560
dog.

50:34.560 --> 50:35.560
Yeah, he's out.

50:35.560 --> 50:36.560
Yup.

50:36.560 --> 50:42.000
So on the 17th we learned that, that Barnes show is gone.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
But does Barnes know now?

50:43.000 --> 50:55.800
On the 16th, So on the 16th, he's promoting the show as

50:55.800 --> 50:56.840
Barnes is back.

50:56.840 --> 50:58.640
He's been too busy, but now he's back.

50:58.640 --> 50:59.640
Very funny.

50:59.640 --> 51:00.640
Next day, gone.

51:00.640 --> 51:01.640
That's very funny.

51:01.640 --> 51:02.640
Yeah.

51:02.640 --> 51:03.640
I think, I think you're right.

51:03.640 --> 51:04.960
I do kind of feel for David Knight a little bit.

51:04.960 --> 51:06.840
He's losing his job right before Christmas.

51:06.840 --> 51:07.840
I get it.

51:07.840 --> 51:08.880
That's fucking tough.

51:08.880 --> 51:13.400
I enjoy seeing bad things happen to Robert Barnes in a different way.

51:13.400 --> 51:18.080
And I know that if he doesn't have his fucking moonlighting gig at Infowars, he's going to

51:18.080 --> 51:21.320
be fine scamming other people with fake constitutional lawsuits.

51:21.320 --> 51:23.680
I think he has, I just enjoy watching him get beat.

51:23.680 --> 51:29.360
I think he has like a newsletter on Dave Rubin's Kickstarter or Patreon clone.

51:29.360 --> 51:30.360
He's going to land five.

51:30.360 --> 51:32.400
He's doing all right.

51:32.400 --> 51:37.340
So Alex says farewell to Barnes, say we'll see you on the evening show that won't exist

51:37.340 --> 51:38.340
in a day.

51:38.340 --> 51:39.340
Yes.

51:39.340 --> 51:43.160
And now I must get to another guest and it is a guest that I got the privilege of hanging

51:43.160 --> 51:47.280
out with in DC when I was there yelling and all this shit.

51:47.280 --> 51:48.280
Oh no.

51:48.280 --> 51:49.480
Someone who had the best speech.

51:49.480 --> 51:50.480
Oh no.

51:50.480 --> 51:57.400
Well, there were a lot of powerful messages at the second million manga march.

51:57.400 --> 52:00.640
This one was about a third as big as the gigantic one.

52:00.640 --> 52:02.000
It was a month ago.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.680
There were still hundreds of thousands of people total, five or six different events

52:05.680 --> 52:06.680
going on.

52:06.680 --> 52:10.520
And last time I had the most powerful message of, we're not going to back down to the globalist,

52:10.520 --> 52:15.400
the new world order Biden's a chai comm agent, Nick Foyntas had the most powerful message

52:15.400 --> 52:16.920
at these events.

52:16.920 --> 52:20.240
The crowds were screaming for, he couldn't even hardly give a speech.

52:20.240 --> 52:21.240
Yeah.

52:21.240 --> 52:24.560
So Nick Foyntas had the best, I thought it was going to be for sure.

52:24.560 --> 52:29.200
It's interesting because I watched hours of these rallies.

52:29.200 --> 52:34.200
Nick Foyntas did not speak at either of the rallies that I watched.

52:34.200 --> 52:36.800
He was clearly speaking in some impromptu fashion.

52:36.800 --> 52:38.080
He was speaking in the beer hall punch?

52:38.080 --> 52:39.400
Is that what's going on there?

52:39.400 --> 52:42.600
He was speaking into a bullhorn on the street.

52:42.600 --> 52:43.600
Something.

52:43.600 --> 52:44.600
Yeah.

52:44.600 --> 52:45.600
He was not at these events.

52:45.600 --> 52:48.880
And there might've been like a third event that I would just don't even know about.

52:48.880 --> 52:49.880
A Klan meeting?

52:49.880 --> 52:51.440
I only have so much time in my life.

52:51.440 --> 52:53.240
I can only watch so many of these rallies.

52:53.240 --> 52:54.240
That is fair.

52:54.240 --> 53:02.100
Um, so you know, McConnell, Barrett, uh, Kavanaugh, Pence, they're all the enemy now.

53:02.100 --> 53:03.100
The GOP is the enemy.

53:03.100 --> 53:04.100
Yeah, of course it is.

53:04.100 --> 53:08.800
You know, I said Sunday when I had had a chance to see Saturday speeches by Foyntas on my

53:08.800 --> 53:09.800
Sunday show.

53:09.800 --> 53:10.800
I said, I think Foyntas is right.

53:10.800 --> 53:16.680
The Republican party, the establishment are the enemies, but we have to make sure that

53:16.680 --> 53:18.160
doesn't get Democrats elected.

53:18.160 --> 53:22.600
We have to make sure we target, uh, neo cons and others to get them out and put populace

53:22.600 --> 53:23.600
in America.

53:23.600 --> 53:24.600
Ferchers in.

53:24.600 --> 53:27.640
But now you see McConnell saying, Oh, we need to be nice to Democrats.

53:27.640 --> 53:30.540
That's how we're going to win Georgia and let them engage in fraud.

53:30.540 --> 53:34.680
He's definitely working for the other side than a shy comm operative.

53:34.680 --> 53:35.960
That's not what McConnell's saying.

53:35.960 --> 53:40.920
He said, he's saying that, uh, you know, insisting on denying reality is probably going to hurt

53:40.920 --> 53:42.120
our electoral chances.

53:42.120 --> 53:46.840
Hey, you guys, you know how you're screaming that all elections are frauds and that you

53:46.840 --> 53:48.440
shouldn't vote.

53:48.440 --> 53:52.640
That's going to hurt us in the elections where we need you to vote.

53:52.640 --> 53:53.640
Yeah.

53:53.640 --> 53:55.720
Um, no, you're a Chinese agent.

53:55.720 --> 53:57.040
Oh, damn it.

53:57.040 --> 53:58.440
Maybe I've gone too far.

53:58.440 --> 54:01.480
I'm Mitch McConnell, so I will learn the error of my ways.

54:01.480 --> 54:02.480
Nope.

54:02.480 --> 54:03.480
No.

54:03.480 --> 54:07.760
You will end up having the people that you have inspired and enabled and facilitated

54:07.760 --> 54:11.280
now screaming at rallies about how we need to destroy you.

54:11.280 --> 54:12.280
Excellent.

54:12.280 --> 54:16.560
But first here's one of the eclipse of Nick Foyntez laying out the future and the future

54:16.560 --> 54:19.160
battle plan at the second big March in DC.

54:19.160 --> 54:25.160
And the first million MAGA March, we promised that if the GOP would not do everything in

54:25.160 --> 54:37.560
their power to keep Trump in office, then we would destroy the GOP for a second million

54:37.560 --> 54:38.560
MAGA March.

54:38.560 --> 54:39.560
We're done making promises.

54:39.560 --> 54:40.560
It has to happen now.

54:40.560 --> 54:41.560
We are going to destroy the GOP.

54:41.560 --> 54:55.160
There's 50 of us.

54:55.160 --> 54:56.160
Destroy the GOP!

54:56.160 --> 54:57.160
Destroy the GOP!

54:57.160 --> 54:58.160
Destroy the GOP!

54:58.160 --> 54:59.160
Is there anything you won't chant?

54:59.160 --> 55:00.160
Destroy the GOP!

55:00.160 --> 55:01.160
They love chants.

55:01.160 --> 55:02.160
They fucking chant all the goddamn time.

55:02.160 --> 55:03.160
It's fun.

55:03.160 --> 55:04.160
Eh, that's fair.

55:04.160 --> 55:08.240
Um, so Alex is like, I think he sees that video and he remembers like being in DC and

55:08.240 --> 55:12.440
he remembers like kind of mad at those women for America first people.

55:12.440 --> 55:16.920
I don't like how they organize these rallies and then don't let me speak at them because

55:16.920 --> 55:19.040
I'm entitled to.

55:19.040 --> 55:23.440
This is a parallel or an allegory or like a gauge on a submarine or a battleship or

55:23.440 --> 55:26.160
an army tanker, a truck.

55:26.160 --> 55:29.320
You have these women that are neo cons and I'm not going to attack them, but the point

55:29.320 --> 55:32.480
is they get all the permits, they take control of the thing.

55:32.480 --> 55:37.320
And then when you hear the speakers they've got, it is just people are falling asleep

55:37.320 --> 55:40.880
and then I show up with a bullhorn and Nick shows up and you get, you know, out of the

55:40.880 --> 55:44.560
a hundred thousand people, 20,000 that here you run over and they're all cheering.

55:44.560 --> 55:47.380
And then it gets 5 million, 10 million views.

55:47.380 --> 55:52.500
And then the poor Republicans with kind of a mainline rhino, a little Trump type deal,

55:52.500 --> 55:53.820
they get 20,000 views.

55:53.820 --> 55:54.960
It's not popular.

55:54.960 --> 55:55.960
It's not constitutional.

55:55.960 --> 56:01.380
It's not what made America, but everyone's always running away from what victory is.

56:01.380 --> 56:02.920
So Alex, I don't think is wrong.

56:02.920 --> 56:06.800
I mean, he's exaggerating stuff, but like, yeah, a lot of those other speakers were a

56:06.800 --> 56:11.800
snooze and Alex yelling has some kind of star quality to him.

56:11.800 --> 56:12.800
He gets people to chant.

56:12.800 --> 56:17.360
But he's also sort of misunderstanding, like spectacle for substance.

56:17.360 --> 56:18.360
Yeah.

56:18.360 --> 56:23.360
Like I don't think that there's anything like him being able to draw a crowd of 10,000,

56:23.360 --> 56:27.160
let's say, isn't an indication that he knows the constitution.

56:27.160 --> 56:31.240
I don't think there's a difference for him between substance and spectacle.

56:31.240 --> 56:35.280
You know, it's not that he understands or misunderstands it or it's just that it doesn't

56:35.280 --> 56:36.280
exist to him.

56:36.280 --> 56:37.280
Yeah.

56:37.280 --> 56:41.160
You know, like 5 million views means 500 million people love this, right?

56:41.160 --> 56:42.160
That's how it works.

56:42.160 --> 56:43.160
Yeah.

56:43.160 --> 56:44.160
That's the only thing that makes sense.

56:44.160 --> 56:45.560
Also, I'd like to clarify one thing.

56:45.560 --> 56:49.980
These people starting these rallies and organizing them and getting the permits does mean that

56:49.980 --> 56:52.120
they can choose who speaks at it and who doesn't.

56:52.120 --> 56:56.920
Well, I feel like I'm missing the part where he's going to say like, so next time we're

56:56.920 --> 56:58.440
going to get the permit.

56:58.440 --> 56:59.440
No.

56:59.440 --> 57:00.440
He's not going to say that?

57:00.440 --> 57:01.440
No.

57:01.440 --> 57:03.520
Well see, cause it feels like that's the real complaint here.

57:03.520 --> 57:06.320
And he's just whining that he's not the winner.

57:06.320 --> 57:08.400
He's too busy with all the work.

57:08.400 --> 57:09.560
He is not.

57:09.560 --> 57:11.680
Psychic trances take a while.

57:11.680 --> 57:12.680
You know what?

57:12.680 --> 57:15.680
I know somebody who just lost his job and is free.

57:15.680 --> 57:18.660
I don't think he's going to fill those shoes.

57:18.660 --> 57:26.320
So Nick Fuentes has an interesting idea for the way forward for these weirdo conservatives.

57:26.320 --> 57:27.320
You know, it's interesting.

57:27.320 --> 57:29.820
There were a lot of Democrats that were saying, destroy the GOP.

57:29.820 --> 57:31.360
This is a message I could get behind.

57:31.360 --> 57:34.640
But of course, that's only the first half of the message.

57:34.640 --> 57:36.680
Destroy the GOP as it exists.

57:36.680 --> 57:38.520
Destroy the GOP establishment.

57:38.520 --> 57:44.000
And what we have to do now is replace it with a GOP that truly represents the American people.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.920
We have to destroy the fake GOP establishment headed by Mitch McConnell that puts America

57:48.920 --> 57:49.920
last.

57:49.920 --> 57:55.040
We have to primary all those people, replace them in the House, in the Senate and the state

57:55.040 --> 57:56.040
governments.

57:56.040 --> 57:59.560
And we have to replace them with people that truly believe in America first, truly believe

57:59.560 --> 58:04.920
in the kind of conservatism that President Trump pushed when he ran in 2016.

58:04.920 --> 58:07.720
Look, Nick Fuentes is like 14 years old.

58:07.720 --> 58:11.160
So I'm going to forgive him for not remembering that they did this already.

58:11.160 --> 58:14.440
Yeah, it was called the Tea Party.

58:14.440 --> 58:18.240
This is the crazier version that you guys wanted last time.

58:18.240 --> 58:20.040
Yeah, this already happened.

58:20.040 --> 58:23.880
We're in another cycle of this, like, oh, it's not the real whatever.

58:23.880 --> 58:24.880
Who cares?

58:24.880 --> 58:25.960
I'm going to forgive that.

58:25.960 --> 58:29.900
What I'm not going to forgive is the fact that he doesn't remember they did that this

58:29.900 --> 58:30.900
year.

58:30.900 --> 58:31.900
Yes, they did do that this year as well.

58:31.900 --> 58:33.320
Laura Loeber was running.

58:33.320 --> 58:34.320
All these other people.

58:34.320 --> 58:36.240
Enrique Tarrio was going to run.

58:36.240 --> 58:42.120
Everybody lost their fucking primaries because the people that you end up attracting are

58:42.120 --> 58:44.400
not not no, no, no.

58:44.400 --> 58:49.520
It's just because it's just because the GOP people in the primary thought they were voting

58:49.520 --> 58:52.760
for a GOP candidate because they've been in there for a while, but they were actually

58:52.760 --> 58:54.560
voting for a traitor.

58:54.560 --> 58:55.560
Right.

58:55.560 --> 58:56.560
Okay.

58:56.560 --> 58:57.560
Got to go.

58:57.560 --> 58:58.560
There we go.

58:58.560 --> 58:59.560
No, I think we should all be screaming.

58:59.560 --> 59:00.560
I apologize.

59:00.560 --> 59:02.640
I believe Loomer did win her primary.

59:02.640 --> 59:03.640
That's true.

59:03.640 --> 59:08.480
That is, she lost in the general, but a lot of those other folks lost in primaries.

59:08.480 --> 59:09.480
Yeah.

59:09.480 --> 59:10.480
No, I think we should all be...

59:10.480 --> 59:11.880
And did the wars employ Deanna Lorraine?

59:11.880 --> 59:14.120
Yes, she might have won.

59:14.120 --> 59:15.520
She did.

59:15.520 --> 59:20.080
I think we should all be screaming at establishment Republicans that the only way the GOP survives

59:20.080 --> 59:24.160
is if they all band together and crush the extreme right wing, and I think we tell the

59:24.160 --> 59:28.300
extreme right wing that the only way the GOP survives is if they band together and crush

59:28.300 --> 59:29.960
the establishment Republicans.

59:29.960 --> 59:34.400
I get the sense that at least half of that's going to happen on its own.

59:34.400 --> 59:35.400
That's probably true.

59:35.400 --> 59:38.560
That's why we got to make sure both happens, because if one half happens, we're going to

59:38.560 --> 59:41.240
get to the Tea Party and then double it.

59:41.240 --> 59:42.240
Yeah.

59:42.240 --> 59:50.640
I don't know if that's avoidable, but interestingly, Nick Fuentes and Alex have slightly different

59:50.640 --> 59:54.480
strategies about what they should do in Georgia.

59:54.480 --> 59:59.560
I'm of the belief that the first blow that we have to strike against the Republican Party

59:59.560 --> 01:00:03.920
is withholding our votes in Georgia, withholding our votes in the Senate runoff and preventing

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.880
them from reclaiming control of the Senate.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.880
Now that's where I may disagree with you.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:08.880
Do it.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.880
Do it.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:10.880
Do it.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:11.880
Do it.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:12.880
Do it.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.880
Do it.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:14.880
Do it.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:15.880
Do it.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:16.880
Do it.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.880
Alex is not into that.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:18.880
He's like, nah, I don't know about that.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.800
He's primarily some Republican, you know, with a crazy person.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:23.800
Yeah.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.800
Great.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.800
I'm all for that.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.800
Yeah.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.720
But torpedoing the election and letting a Democrat win, I don't know.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:36.360
Whereas Nick Fuentes is, we need to punish the Republican Party, withhold our votes.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:43.280
He's very much like accelerationist towards this thing, and Alex is more like, I don't

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.280
know.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.280
These people disgust me.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.280
Yes.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:53.360
And I'm like, wait up, how fucking cruel are you to me to be like, we're gonna kill everybody

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:58.280
with Trump as the king of God and the good Lord and Jesus Christ.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.660
And after losing the election, what we need to do is we need to focus on small elections

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:05.280
and we need to primary the Republican.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.280
Fuck you.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.280
Yeah.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:11.200
The Lord chose Trump, but the Lord also needs primaries from time to time.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.200
Fuck off.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:17.440
But the, what the Satan made God forget was county seats.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.440
Yeah.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.440
What?

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.440
What are we doing?

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.440
Yeah.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.560
So Nick has an interesting angle on QAnon.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:28.660
What I like about the QAnon stuff is that it gets a lot of people to believe the right

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:32.640
things, although it gets them to believe the right things for the wrong reasons.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.200
It gets them to start thinking about connections between global special interests.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:40.760
It gets them to ask the right questions about pedophiles and satanic elites and things like

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:45.040
that, largely for the wrong reasons, but it does get them to some of the right places.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:51.600
I do appreciate the hubris of all of these idiots who are like, you know what?

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:57.400
What we need to do is get the swirling masses to believe something similar to what I believe

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.800
and then I'll be able to control it.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.240
It doesn't quite work that way usually.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.240
No, it doesn't.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.240
No.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.240
Sorry Fuentes.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:10.720
But I will say again, I'm going to give Nick a pass on this because he is a wee baby, but

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:15.800
he seems to be patting himself on the back a little bit for discovering the concept of

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.800
local politics.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.800
Of course.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.280
You know, Trump launched this hostile takeover of the top of the party, I mean literally

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:26.400
becoming the president, and now we have to wage a war for everything beneath the presidency.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:30.280
We have to wage a war to primary, House Republicans, Senate Republicans.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:33.260
We have to run in state races and local races.

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:36.200
We have to take over the RNC and the party apparatus.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.200
So I'm actually more energized.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.160
General Fuentes, I've not heard it better said.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.680
That was perfectly said.

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:41.760
It's so trite.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:50.480
I have in 2018, I have in 2016, I have in 2014, I have in 2012.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.600
This is not revolutionary stuff.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.780
This is very bland.

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.200
And that's kind of one of the things that I think is interesting and a little bit scary

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:04.080
about Nick is that beneath this there's also an obsession with the idea of fighting against

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:12.700
amnesty and identity and America, like all this stuff, but it is also like, okay, yeah,

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:18.120
you're talking about running for a local election.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:23.520
You're running for the school president or whatever.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:29.240
That's the banality, the minutia, the boringness of it with the evilness hidden behind it is

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.240
kind of scary.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:36.640
Oh, Biden is stealing the election and he's killing all of us with the fucking globalists.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.360
And that is why I'm going to vote no on the expansion of that road.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.960
Route six stays the same length.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.960
Yeah.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.960
So Nick, Nick's out of there.

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.840
Uh, in and out, in and out.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:48.840
Got to destroy the GOP.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:49.840
Got it.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.480
Um, now we're going to play a new game on this show.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:04:00.200
Uh, I'm going to play, uh, an angry clip from Alex Jones without who it's targeted at.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.200
Okay.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.480
And you have to guess who is he yelling about?

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.480
Okay.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:05.480
I like this game.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:11.080
Uh, this is called guess who Alex is telling to burn in hell, burn in hell, you little

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:16.920
Satanist on a power trip about how great you are and how amazing you are and how, how ascended

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:21.240
you are as you bring in global collapse and extermination burn in hell.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.240
Who is Alex?

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.720
No, no, no, no, no.

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:25.720
It's little.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.320
I thought the little, you can ask me, I can ask you two questions.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:30.320
Two questions.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:31.320
All right.

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.320
Rich or no?

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.320
Very.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.320
Very rich.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.320
Very rich.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.320
Obscenely rich.

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.320
I don't know if I want to say obscenely, but quite rich.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.320
Quite rich.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.320
Yes.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:40.320
All right.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.320
I'm going to give you five questions.

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.740
I wish I had, I wish I had asked a more specific question because very rich is a, is a more

01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:45.920
subjective question that I think I want.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.920
Super rich.

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.920
Billion or higher?

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:48.920
Probably.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:49.920
I don't know.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.440
I, I have a really hard time.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:57.880
So not one of our major, it's not Soros, it's not Spiros, it's not that, oh.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:58.880
Out of five.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:04:59.880
Out of five.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:05.160
Um, have we mocked his or her appearance?

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.160
No.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.160
What?

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.520
No, no, no.

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.520
Not us.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.520
Oh.

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.520
I meant Alex.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.520
I don't know why I'm saying we.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:13.520
No.

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.520
Alex hasn't mocked their appearance?

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.520
I don't think so.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.520
Well then it's definitely not Stelter.

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:19.760
I'm not sure I've heard Alex bring this person up before.

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.760
Well this is unfair.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.760
Yup.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:23.760
Little person who thinks there's a AOC.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.760
I'm going to go with AOC.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.120
He brings her up all the time.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.120
Oh shit, that's right.

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.120
That's four.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.120
What was I thinking?

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.120
God damn it.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.120
What was I thinking?

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:33.760
You have all the pieces you need.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:34.760
Ugh.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:35.760
Um.

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.000
Bezos' wife.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
No.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Oh, okay.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Tom Cruise.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:47.960
Oh, because of the clip of him yelling about COVID, god damn it.

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:54.360
Oh, Dan, you threw, you played the player.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.360
Well done.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.360
That's why we play the game.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.080
That's a good one to open with, yeah.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:06.560
So, um, Nick Fuentes is gone, Barnes has come on, there's no indication of anything, trouble

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:11.360
in paradise as it were, and I get a little bit bored, honestly, listening to this episode

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:16.600
now, because like, listen to this, this is 30 seconds, this is what Alex thinks has substance

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.600
to it.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.880
This is what he thinks his job is.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:26.920
Pompeo tests negative for COVID-19, will quarantine, oh my gosh, oh it's so scary, even though

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:32.360
it has a death rate of like 0.00 or whatever, it's all just an excuse for Tom Cruise and

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:36.800
Nancy Pelosi to just act arrogant and scream at people and do whatever they want.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:40.920
Over the counter home test for COVID-19, it's US Green Line, so we can have more hysteria,

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:47.400
more fear, Kansas mayor resigns over violent threats for backing mask mandate, I don't

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:51.740
feel safe anymore, we'll move to North Korea, you witch.

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:52.740
That's it?

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:55.200
Like this is the substance of his news breakdown.

01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:02.400
Like it's kind of like a dishy insult after reading the headline, it's like what is this?

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:03.400
This is bad.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:06.280
And also, Cruise didn't need that shit.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:09.860
He gets to act like he owns everything and runs the place because he's the figurehead

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:10.860
of a religion.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:15.480
I also find it strange that Alex isn't taking issue with the Scientology aspect.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:16.480
No, no problem there.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.480
No.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:18.640
Well, that makes perfect sense though.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:25.520
So Alex has been dealing with Hayden, General Hayden, saying on Twitter that he agreed with

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:30.360
someone else who tweeted that Alex should be arrested and Alex is pumped.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.360
Of course he is.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:40.840
Well, yesterday, I was getting more emails and more calls about CNN and all these publications

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:44.560
saying Alex Jones may be arrested.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:48.760
On Saturday, there were a lot of publications that said, and I gave a speech in DC, did

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.480
Jones threaten to kill Biden?

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.600
And then by Sunday, calls for Jones to be arrested for threatening to kill Joe Biden.

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:59.920
And then by Monday, Alex Jones to be arrested for threatening to kill Joe Biden.

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:03.360
That's how the media works, how they're gaslighting and fraud works.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.880
Alex is so excited about this.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:08.480
Yeah, that's got to give him a huge boner, totally.

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:13.400
Michael Hayden is paying attention to him in a way that he probably would never...

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.680
I got months out of, yeah.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.960
So now Alex is going to imply that maybe Michael Hayden's a pedophile.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:21.920
I mean, this is a stolen valor monster.

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:27.240
He also is involved with some very mysterious international orphanages and transfer of children.

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.320
I can tell you that's being looked into already.

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:33.000
I got contacted by some folks, I'll just leave it at that.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.600
And that's why I said he looks like a child molester.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:39.280
I'm not saying he's a child molester, I'm just saying Brian Stelter looks about as creepy

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.280
as you'd get.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.280
You're not going to want any babysitting kids.

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:44.360
But Hayden's own Twitter photo is the creepiest photo of him.

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:47.280
Please pull up Michael T. Hayden's Twitter photo, I just want to show people.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:50.760
He's like in a Steelers cap on a mountain top.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.720
It's not that creepy.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.720
Sometimes I'm just not sure if things are real.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.720
No.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.720
It's very weird.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:01.000
I was listening to that in my head, just part of this being like, is this real?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Am I dreaming?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
What's happening?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
What's going on?

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
It's pretty strange.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.560
It's like, ah, this guy has tweeted something I dislike.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.200
I am going to accuse him of stealing children from an orphanage.

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.200
Yeah.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.560
Because he looks creepy to me.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:14.560
Yeah.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.560
It's very weird.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:16.800
But Alex has a gotcha.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:21.480
And he got this gotcha from, I don't know, I guess Harrison Smith probably, someone who

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:27.640
works at Infowars, scrolled through Hayden's Twitter timeline and found some things to

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.640
get upset about.

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.400
These guys are great researchers.

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:36.040
He put out a bunch of tweets saying pro-life about Trump, thank you Amy Covid Barrett for

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.840
groundbreaking decision.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:45.800
So what this is, is he had tweeted a picture of like graves and it was from another account.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:49.960
He had retweeted it with a quote tweet saying pro-life question mark.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:50.960
Right.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:51.960
So that's the first tweet.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.960
Sure.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:53.960
Sure, sure, sure.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:59.240
And then they put out, it's a joke account, an image of a mass grave implying that Trump's

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:03.560
killing everybody because the Supreme Court ruled churches could be opened.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:06.020
That's unconstitutional to close them.

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:11.800
But then literally days later, this is November 26th, go to his Twitter and show people this

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:12.800
guys.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.880
He puts out a Pittsburgh Steelers.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.600
That's November 26th.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:23.800
On November 27th, he tweets, let's do some football, Pittsburgh proud, happy birthday,

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:28.080
no social distancing, NFL game.

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.120
Now folks, again, imagine the irony of this.

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:34.680
He's saying Trump is mass graving people.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:39.240
Trump is murdering people because a Baptist or Catholic church or Buddhist temple or mosque

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.480
can be opened with 10 people, a thousand, whatever.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:42.720
Walmart can be opened.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.080
Target can be opened.

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:48.480
Disneyland can be opened, but your churches can't.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.160
Liquor stores are open.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.840
All this is going on, but he's a big Pittsburgh Steelers fan.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.400
They actually work with Pittsburgh Steelers.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.800
I'm, I'm, oh, I'm stalking you Hayden.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.960
Open source, baby.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.280
Open source, baby.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.280
Wow.

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:06.760
So that gif that he tweeted was from last season in the football, back when there were

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:13.000
huge crowds for sporting events, it's just a gif of Steelers fans putting their towels

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
in the air.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Great.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Yeah.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
It's not a gotcha.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.960
It's not a, no, it's, it's a, it's an old picture.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.800
Now, the only thing sadder than reading those tweets is scrolling through his timeline to

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.000
find those tweets.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Yeah.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.400
And then Alex thinking that this is like an own.

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.400
Yeah.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.400
I gotcha.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.400
I gotcha Hayden.

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.400
Open source, baby.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.400
Yeah.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.400
That's, that's not good.

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.400
Log off the internet.

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.400
Get off the internet.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:39.880
I mean, when you read, when you read too much about tweets, you know, you, you can read

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.640
everybody, reading one tweet is too many tweets, but when you read about tweets, now we're

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:44.960
in real, get off the internet.

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.880
That's what a whole lot of like national file articles are about.

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.400
They're just about someone's tweets.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.600
So fucking crazy.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.600
Yeah.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:52.600
It seems trivial.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.600
Yeah.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.160
So I was getting a little bit like, I don't know.

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:56.240
I feel untethered.

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:57.640
I don't know what's going on here.

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:02.760
I, you know, I feel like it's really important that, uh, Alex is downsizing.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.040
Well I've got bad news for you.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.040
Effective immediately, Dan.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.040
Oh no.

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.040
You are fired.

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.040
That's all right.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.040
Sorry.

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:12.120
Uh, I doesn't feel like at all, like anything's going on here on the 16th.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.560
It seems very much just business as usual.

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:15.560
Right.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.760
And it kind of was boring me.

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.760
Yeah.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.080
It's just Nick Fuentes has a great idea to destroy the GOP, but also I don't want to

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:24.600
do what Nick Fuentes has suggested in order to destroy the GOP.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.600
Yeah.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.600
Yeah.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:27.600
I don't like that.

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.600
I don't like that.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.000
Um, and I just kind of like, I don't know.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.800
And then Patrick, I can't remember his last name.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:36.800
It'll come to me later.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.800
Dempsey.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:41.920
No, he's the guy who's the overstock CEO who was dating that Russian spy.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:42.920
Oh yeah.

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:43.920
Yeah.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:44.920
Yeah.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:45.920
Yeah.

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:46.920
Marina Abramovich.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:47.920
Bettina.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.920
Bettina.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:49.920
That's right.

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:50.920
Yeah.

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:51.920
Yeah.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:52.920
He's back and he has an interesting story to tell.

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:57.600
He and the MyPillow guy should have a tag team wrestling team, like something.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.400
I didn't bring this up.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:04.160
This guy, Patrick, the overstock CEO introduced Michael Flynn at the rally.

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.160
Of course he did.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.160
Yeah.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.420
Why wouldn't I, why wouldn't I know that?

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:08.640
Why wouldn't I just agree with that?

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:11.840
I didn't bring that up on the show cause his speech was kind of like, I don't care.

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:12.840
Of course.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:18.560
But he is back with Alex and man, he has got a big old story to tell.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.560
I believe your story.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.680
I know there were a lot of stings on Hillary.

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:22.960
She was very arrogant.

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.720
She was taking over what, $2 billion from different governments, individuals, anybody

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.920
that would give her money, she'd give them access.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.840
That's what the email server shows out of the Southern district has been investigating

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:33.840
her.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:34.840
I know they've been investigating Hunter.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:38.220
When you came out and said this, and I saw the video yesterday, I said, that's the same

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:42.280
stuff I got told that there were successful stings on Hillary, but then when they thought

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:46.960
she was going to win, that all got scrubbed and that the justice department has all that

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.280
info has been protecting her.

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.520
So thanks for joining us.

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:52.040
We've got the floor here to give us the latest.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:59.000
So Alex has played a clip of Patrick from another show and he's telling this story that

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.880
he got approached by the FBI to facilitate a sting operation on Hillary Clinton.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:07.600
And then eventually they're like, yeah, we're not going to do anything.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:12.440
We got her, you know, giving up, taking a bribe from a foreign country, but we're not

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.920
going to do anything about it.

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.480
And then Patrick didn't say anything about it until four years or whatever.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.080
So he seems credible.

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.080
That sounds right.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.080
Yeah.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.080
I wondered as you were playing that, why have me on?

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.080
You just play.

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.160
I told the story in another show, but I'll give you some more detail.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.160
This is true.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.600
By the way, I'm in an incredibly precarious situation.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:32.560
Well, I've already, no, I want you to want to know why you did it.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.560
I have a good idea.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.560
The country's in trouble.

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.320
It's time for us all to give our maximum.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.320
Yeah.

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.320
I mean, the hell with it.

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:43.720
I I've, I've been getting myself an ulcer for two years wanting to come out, but being told

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.560
trust the process, trust the process, trust the process.

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:54.080
I, about a year ago, there was a conversation or communication between myself and the powers

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:58.080
that be that said, I'm not comfortable being part of a coverup.

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:02.680
And they said, you're, you wait until after the election, after the election, you can

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.200
say whatever the hell you want to say, tell the whole story.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:10.640
So I waited to the election and I couldn't live with myself if I'm not coming out about

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.640
it now.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.640
So he's got it.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.720
He's got to tell his story now because the election's over.

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.480
He's free to, uh, to tell it all.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:18.680
Throw tomatoes at this man.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:25.560
So tomatoes at this man, he, in 2015, December, 2015, coming up on five years, right?

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:29.100
He was approached, approached by the FBI, of course.

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:33.040
And they said in December of 2015, we need you.

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.040
This is word for word.

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.480
I have something called an eidetic memory.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.960
When I tell you something's word for word, it's word for word.

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:47.000
They came back and said, this part of the FBI is asking for your help again, the there.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.680
There are two groups investigating the FBI in the FBI, investigating Hillary Clinton,

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:52.680
Patrick.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:54.240
One is the email group.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:58.320
And we know that's a whitewash, but there's a group in New York who really wants to put

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.240
her ass in stir.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.320
They're going after financials, the Clinton financials.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:09.320
Comey has been blocking them, uh, from acting saying there wasn't enough to justify them

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:12.680
going aggressive in their investigative techniques.

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:19.500
I don't know if, uh, it, it should be seen as like normal that an investigation starts

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.560
with wanting to incarcerate somebody.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.560
Yeah.

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:23.560
That's probably not good.

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.840
It seems like that's a tainted investigation.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:31.000
It's almost like one that wouldn't really hold up upon, uh, and it seems like if any

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.960
of this is true, which I don't think any of it is, uh, Comey might have been coming from

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:39.640
a position of there's no reason to engage in an investigation like this.

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:44.320
It could be a cover up or it could also be, you guys are telling me that you want to talk

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:49.200
to the CEO of overstock.com to try and sting Hillary Clinton.

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.760
Guess who doesn't get to do that?

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.180
You guys go away now.

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:54.880
Can I show all of my cards?

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.680
Sure.

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.040
I don't believe any of this.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.360
I will, I will say this.

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.680
I believe the CEO is making this shit up.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.680
Right off the bat.

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:09.000
The only thing idetic about this guy's memory is that he was able to able to remember the

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
word idetic.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
He did memorize that.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.200
That is bullshit.

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.440
So here's the deal.

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:18.140
Turkey has already bribed Hillary Clinton, uh, for $20 million.

01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:19.140
Well, sure.

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:22.600
So now we just need to get Patrick to facilitate another bribe.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.600
Okay.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:27.420
So they were saying that Comey had been saying up to that point, there was not enough predicate

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:30.200
information to justify a sting.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:35.040
However, Patrick, they told me information has come in and Hillary's accepted a bribe.

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:41.600
She took a $20 million bribe from Turkey and that information has come in and the group

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:48.480
in New York has now used that as leverage to force Comey to sign off on a sting and

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.820
he has approved a sting and the New York group is sending to you for you to help and you're

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:54.520
going to facilitate a bribe.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:59.440
And there's another government that was known to want to bribe Hillary.

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.440
It's an idetic memory.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.240
You're going to befriend that government.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:06.480
You're going to befriend the bag man in that government and somewhere, and it's going to

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:11.280
happen in the next two months, Patrick, somewhere, there's going to be a room and Hillary Clinton

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.280
walks into that room.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.280
There's going to be a room.

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.280
It's very formulaic.

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:19.160
Well, it was a very specific thing.

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:22.360
They told me that there's going to be a room she's going to come in for 10 minutes.

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:24.000
The bag man is going to be in for 10 minutes.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.640
They're going to be there alone.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.640
And that's it.

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:27.640
That's your assignment.

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:32.840
He's got to find, he's got to befriend this government, some unnamed other government

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:39.420
and insinuate himself in such a way that he can be a go-between between the bag man and

01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:44.960
Hillary Clinton to get this, by the way.

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.520
I'm just going to throw this out there as like a huge question for this story.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:54.560
I'm just going to go out and say, why did they come to him?

01:18:54.560 --> 01:19:00.720
Does he have experience cozying up to governments or in any sort of like, he did date that Russian

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:01.720
spy.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:06.640
I think that might be a bigger red flag here.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.880
He started overstock.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:09.880
Yeah.

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:10.880
Yeah.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.880
Okay.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.880
So yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't buy any of this.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:17.360
It's so complicated and I can't, I just can't imagine any of this.

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:23.120
We know you're dating a compromised agent of a foreign government.

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.160
I don't know the timeline on that.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.160
I don't know the timeline on that.

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:28.640
It might've been at a different point in his life.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:34.160
That said, this is also a sting on that bag man because that other government isn't going,

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.000
they think that this is a real, no, no, no.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.040
They're going along with the whole, no, the whole sting is planned.

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.360
The bag man is not in on it.

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:44.300
So now the foreign government is trying to entrap Hillary Clinton along with the help

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.300
of the FBI?

01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:46.300
Probably.

01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:47.300
I don't think so.

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:48.720
I think the only people that aren't interested is Turkey.

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:49.720
They want their money back.

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:50.720
I guess that's it.

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:53.320
Give me the overstock guy.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:58.000
So look, I think that Patrick had a really reasonable response to this and it's that,

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.840
Hey man, if I do this, I'm going to commit crimes.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:05.200
You better not arrest me for those crimes I commit in order to set this up.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.520
I need immunity.

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:11.640
This sounds like somebody writing a much better movie where they didn't commit all the crimes

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.640
that they did.

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.560
Instead they were not crimes.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:18.080
This is, this is the clip where it really turned for me too.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.340
From a like, ah, story to a ooh.

01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:26.040
They gave me that and it was up to me how to create that event.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:27.040
So it's all up to me.

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.920
And I told them, look, to make that happen, there's going to be some bribing and stuff.

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:35.520
And I need a, I need something called an acts otherwise illegal letter, which is a letter

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.480
they can give you when they're asking you to do something like this, like get involved

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:41.000
in a federal election and bribe someone.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.120
And they went back and I see the time I'll finish this in 45 seconds and then we'll continue

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:46.120
the story.

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:47.120
I'll finish this part.

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.480
And they, they said, we'll have to go back to the office and discuss it.

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:53.720
They came back in two days and said, word for word now, we've been told to tell you

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:57.960
we can't give you a letter, but if you'll come to DC, the director says you can be shown

01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:58.960
a letter.

01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:01.280
And I said, oh, this is coming from director Comey.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:08.480
And two federal agents looked me in the eye and said, and, and I said, oh, this is coming

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.880
from director Comey and the president.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:16.880
And two federal agents looked me in the eye and said, and I said, well, you can tell director

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:20.800
Comey and president Obama that from them is good enough for me.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:21.800
Consider Hillary bride.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:22.800
Come back.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.800
You'll be right back.

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:24.800
Oh, so it's Obama's right.

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:28.520
If this one is just so big, we know the Obamas and the Clintons don't like each other.

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:29.520
Stay with us.

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:30.520
Holy shit.

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:31.520
Okay.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:32.520
Holy shit.

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.520
Okay.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.520
Okay.

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:35.520
So this is, wow.

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.520
This is 2015.

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:37.520
Wow.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.520
Obama is like, it's time to take Hill down.

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.520
It's time to take her down.

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:46.240
I had her as secretary of state for long enough and now we just got to get rid of her.

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:50.360
Well, it starts to make sense when they come back from break and they lay out more of what

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.860
the conspiracy is here.

01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:57.520
But yes, it is a little bit hard to put your head around like, ah, yes, Obama is trying

01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.520
to sting Hillary.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.780
Also, also stop, stop me real quick.

01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:04.840
If I, cause I could be wrong.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:12.500
Is it regular practice for the FBI to clandestinely come to you and say, we need you to sting

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:18.880
the most famous woman in the world.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:22.880
And let me tell you this, we've got no ideas.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.080
Go for it, buddy.

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:27.160
However you think you can make this sting happen.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.920
We're not even giving you help.

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:35.400
You're basically MacGyver and look, you know what to do.

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:39.520
Look, we, we here at the FBI don't like to micromanage.

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:40.520
Yes.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:55.560
Comey said, Comey said, do your thing, Obama famously lacks secret super spy guy from Overstock.

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:57.800
Sell me on this story more, give me more.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:01.720
I'm imagining this guy just like coming in from the ceiling on wires.

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:03.440
That's my only image of spy work.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.440
Yeah, basically.

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:05.440
Yeah.

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:09.440
Um, so Patrick, they come back from break and he says something really interesting that

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:15.160
makes me think like, Oh, he might know more about Alex than he's letting on.

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:19.120
When all, when the dust settles, everyone's going to see the mainstream press.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:22.320
There are the kooks that they are, they're trying to, they're part of this.

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:26.480
They're trying to keep people from understanding what they're seeing in front of them and good

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:27.480
for you.

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.480
So respect.

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:33.000
I'm trying to say in a graceful way, I don't know about your past beliefs, respect.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.880
The only thing is I want to be clear, I have nothing to do with white, anything white identitarianism

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:43.120
is true, anything racist, I assume you're on the same, well, I mean, the media says

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.120
Trump's a Nazi.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.120
I wouldn't support Trump if he was.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.120
It's all pure crap.

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:49.640
Why, why, why did you need to bring that up?

01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:50.640
Apropos of nothing.

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:54.880
I am just going to be here on Info Wars saying that I don't believe in any of this white

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:58.200
identitarian nonsense just in case anyone asks.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.200
Yeah.

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.200
I don't know.

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:06.520
I, I, granted I have not taken as many media appearances as some, I've never found that

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:12.080
I needed to distance myself from white identitarianism in any appearances.

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:16.160
Seems like if you do that, that kind of is because you know that the person you're talking

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.520
to might have some leanings in that direction.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.520
Or maybe you're just sitting there thinking like, oh, I'm being interviewed after Nick

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.520
Fuentes.

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.520
Oh shit.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.520
Yeah.

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:27.480
I mean, this is a really complicated kind of situation.

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:31.040
Look, before we go any further, I just want to let you know that I do not support the

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:34.560
actions of the Thuggee cult from Temple of Doom.

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.000
I don't support that.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.120
I don't know why I need to say that here.

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:39.480
Apropos of nothing.

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:41.040
Raises questions.

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.720
So the sting, it works.

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:43.720
Yeah.

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:44.720
They succeed.

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:45.720
They pull it off.

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:46.720
I forgot.

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.720
This ends with a success.

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:49.720
Yes.

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:50.720
Yeah.

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:51.720
And then the cover up.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:52.720
Oh, it was so good.

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:53.720
Yeah.

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:54.720
Yeah.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:55.720
Okay.

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:56.720
I got you.

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:57.720
Patrick pulled off probably the best sting since the sting.

01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:58.720
That sounds right.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:24:59.720
That sounds right.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.720
And then things fell apart.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:01.720
Oh no.

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:05.920
So back to the, let me, I don't want to skip the punchline on all this.

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:07.680
So they told me I needed to forget it.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:08.680
And I said, why?

01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:10.800
And they said, look, it's been decided at the top.

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.760
We've realized there's no side Hillary.

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:15.840
Nothing's going to stop Hillary Clinton from being president now.

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:19.960
And the day she's president, she's going to send her men over the FBI, her people over

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:24.760
the FBI and ask who was part of investigating Hillary and everyone who was part of this.

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:28.040
Patrick, we're all going to be destroyed from the top to the bottom.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.320
And this includes you, Patrick.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:33.880
So it's been decided at the very top, this mission has been scrubbed and we mean it.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:37.520
You have to wipe every moment of this from your memory.

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:38.520
Wow.

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:39.520
But it's eidetic.

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.520
He can't.

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.520
Yes, sir.

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:42.520
I understand.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:48.040
I don't believe any of this, none of it, but I want to be clear about something.

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:53.760
If you make a claim like this, what we should do as a society is immediately put you in

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:58.680
front of like the most serious court that is imaginable produce evidence because the

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:00.520
stakes of this are way too high.

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.520
Crazy.

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:06.520
And telling the truth, the stakes and the importance for the public good is so important

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.920
that you cannot not prove it.

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:09.920
Yes, absolutely.

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:14.420
If you are lying, you need to go to prison because the stakes are so serious in that

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:15.420
side too.

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:20.500
You can't be allowed to make these sorts of claims that are about like international espionage

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:25.560
and like plots against society and just do it with impunity.

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:29.260
If you can't prove this, you can't make claims like this.

01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:31.600
That's how I would like to see things shake up.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:36.240
I imagine a system of pneumatic tubes where you make a claim like this and then all of

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.840
a sudden, and then you're in the court and you're like, whoa, whoa, what just happened?

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:46.240
But it should not be a situation where, you know, like you're punished.

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:50.320
It shouldn't be punitive unless you're clearly making this shit up.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.320
Yeah.

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:52.320
Yeah.

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.320
Yeah.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:54.320
It's just too serious.

01:26:54.320 --> 01:27:00.900
And I think with swings this big, we're not dealing with quite as much nuance in the law.

01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:01.900
You know?

01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:03.740
This seems like it would be incredibly easy to prove.

01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:04.920
Very simple.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.800
Very simple.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:10.480
If he's telling the truth, there'd be so much documentation.

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:13.800
I don't care about him saying like, oh, you have to wipe it from your memory.

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:14.800
Well, guess what?

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.540
Hillary didn't become president.

01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:21.800
So all that fear of her like reprising against people didn't come to pass.

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:26.200
There'd probably be tons of people within the FBI who would corroborate your story.

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.200
Sure.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.460
I'm going to guess that you remember the bag man's name.

01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:30.460
You would think.

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:32.800
Maybe the country that bribed Hillary.

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:33.800
I don't know.

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:35.620
This is so offensive to me.

01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:40.040
So if I understand correctly, the timeline of the story goes thus, all right?

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.040
Yes.

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:42.040
December 2015.

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.040
December 2015.

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.040
All right.

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:49.320
He kicks ass on the sting, gets all the way to somewhere in 2015 where everybody in the

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.640
2016, they decided that Hillary is going to win.

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:53.640
All right.

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:54.640
So they've just decided that it's over.

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:55.640
Right.

01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:57.240
And then Hillary doesn't win.

01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.360
And I believe that was the same year.

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.360
Correct?

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:01.360
Yeah.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.400
And then there was the new president on 2017.

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:04.400
Yeah.

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.400
Yeah.

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:06.400
January.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:15.360
Now, if, if I were somebody who had just successfully executed a sting operation on Hillary Clinton.

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.360
Right.

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:17.520
Who was not president.

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:23.520
Someone who is famous, not just not president, but someone who lost to the guy who screamed,

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:24.520
lock her up.

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:25.520
Oh yeah.

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.920
And like the whole, whole big crowds of people chanting.

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:33.560
I wouldn't wait until after he had lost his election to tell people I would go to him.

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:34.560
Yeah.

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:35.560
Yeah.

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:44.280
If you, if you were inclined to take the gigantic risks involved in that kind of espionage sting

01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:45.280
operation.

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:48.800
Why again, Hillary Clinton.

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.000
Involving a foreign government.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Yes.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Yeah.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.680
If you're willing to take those kinds of risks, I would assume, yeah, once Trump won, you'd

01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:58.480
be like, I got to get in a room.

01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:00.000
Now we get to do this whole thing.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.560
Now we get to, now I get to arrest Hillary Clinton.

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:03.900
I did all the work.

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:05.000
It wasn't for nothing.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.400
They probably will let me do it.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:09.960
Like I'll put the handcuffs on her.

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.720
I think that that didn't happen because it didn't happen.

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:13.960
I'm going to go with that one.

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:14.960
Yeah.

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:15.960
That's reasonable.

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:20.680
So I was kind of confused about the idea that Obama was behind this, but Patrick does clear

01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.560
that up here.

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:28.800
And after some hemming and hawing, eventually the following story was expressed to me.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:35.180
And it runs like this, Patrick, what you need to understand, so this is late January, 2016.

01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:36.180
You might need to check your notes.

01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:39.880
What you need to understand is President Obama, and this is word for word, from there's really

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:44.820
four federal people of different types involved, and this is word for word, Patrick, you need

01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:49.400
to understand that at this point, President Obama has his people across the federal bureaucracy,

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:53.600
but especially in the Department of Justice, Hillary Clinton is going to be president for

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:57.120
eight years and nothing is going to change that, but think of it this way.

01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:03.720
Think of there as being a Bunsen burner within the Department of Justice, and on that Bunsen

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:08.720
burner, that information about the two bribes you were part of gathering, that'll be sitting

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:09.720
there.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:13.120
But the hand on the Bunsen burner is going to be one of Barack Obama's people.

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:17.400
If Hillary Clinton is a good girl and defends Obamacare and such, that flame stays low.

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:22.080
If she's a bad girl and gets thinking for herself, that flame gets turned up.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:26.360
And that way, Barack Obama's going to manage Hillary Clinton for eight years, she's president.

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:28.360
Well, that's exactly what the feds have tried to do.

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:29.360
No, no, no.

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:30.360
You don't want to step on the line.

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.360
You don't want to step on this line, Alex.

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.360
You want to hear-

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.360
Okay, so back to the Bunsen burner.

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:35.960
Two or three more sentences.

01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:39.380
Hey, the story's too good, Alex, you're interrupting.

01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:44.160
Do you know how many times people with an eidetic memory say, and this is word for word,

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.160
remind you.

01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:46.160
They do say that a lot, I would imagine.

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:47.160
I don't know.

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:48.160
They say it-

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:49.160
But also-

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:50.160
They say it initially?

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:51.160
One time.

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:52.160
He-

01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.160
And then you're like, oh shit, you're telling the truth.

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:57.120
They don't repeat it over and over and over again in the same story.

01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.120
Yeah.

01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:00.040
So Obama was going to manage Hillary.

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.040
Yeah.

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:07.280
Because he had this leverage on her with this bribe that the Overstock CEO managed to pull

01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:08.280
off.

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:09.280
Right.

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:10.280
Yeah.

01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.280
Here's what Alex stepped on.

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:15.280
Two or three more sentences.

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:18.240
That way, Barack Obama, for the whole time Hillary Clinton is president, Barack Obama's

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:22.400
going to be managing her, and she's going to step down, and Michelle's going to run,

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.520
and Patrick, that's the plan.

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:25.520
Still?

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:26.520
Wow.

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.040
Say that again, because I did mess up the bunch line.

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.480
The Bunsen burner can be turned up, it can be turned down.

01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:37.000
It gets down, and that way, Barack Obama's going to manage Hillary Clinton for the eight

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.880
years she's president, then she's going to step down, and Michelle's going to run, and

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.640
Patrick, that's the plan.

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:43.640
Wow.

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:45.840
That makes perfect sense with Biden being an Obama-

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:46.840
Yes, it does.

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:47.840
Literal zombie.

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:48.840
Yeah.

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:49.840
It makes so much sense.

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:50.840
It makes perfect sense.

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:56.720
This ridiculous story that this dude is telling on your show, you just take without any kind

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:57.720
of critical-

01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:58.720
So much sense.

01:31:58.720 --> 01:31:59.720
That just makes so much sense.

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:02.960
No real follow-up questions as to, what the fuck are you talking about?

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:03.960
Nothing like that.

01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:04.960
No.

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:05.960
He gets to the end of the story.

01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:11.400
Obama set up so he could blackmail Hillary, and then eight years, he'd be the shadow president

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:16.160
behind Hillary, and then his wife would be president after that.

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.720
This is just absurd.

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:19.720
Yeah.

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:20.720
Yeah.

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:21.940
Oh, boy.

01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:23.320
But kind of fun.

01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:24.320
It is kind of fun.

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:25.320
A little fun.

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:30.240
I do like that he thinks that it's such a great punchline, that it's Michelle that's

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.240
going to run.

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:38.560
I do understand that we on Infowars have been screaming about Michelle Obama becoming president

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.200
since 2009, buddy.

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:41.440
We're fine.

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:44.040
They've been on that train for a while.

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:47.520
You are not going to blow my mind with a, Michelle is the secret at the end of this

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.520
conspiracy.

01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:49.520
Right.

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:56.900
I also just don't think that there's a good use for this conspiracy, because it takes

01:32:56.900 --> 01:33:01.760
some of the agency away from their biggest bad person, which is the Clintons.

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:02.760
No.

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:06.360
It's like McConnell, the secret one was Obama, it's double Obama.

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:10.480
No, Hillary is like the devil that you have to be afraid of.

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:15.900
It doesn't make sense for her to then be a patsy of Obama.

01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:19.440
It's emotionally unsatisfying for the Infowars universe.

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:23.240
Also, just prove any of this, dick.

01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:27.360
I think it's a fun shit-talking story, and if he wrote this down and he was like, I'm

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:32.800
going to try and sell this to people, one, he needs to get better at his delivery, because

01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:34.680
I don't buy this shit at all.

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:38.480
This delivery doesn't matter how bad it is with Alex, he's going to believe him.

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:46.080
And three, Patrick says he has two more bombshells that are coming eventually, so we may have

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:52.800
even bigger swings coming in the future, but we're going to have to wait for those.

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:58.360
I would love for you to release your next bombshells next Monday, if you'd like, or

01:33:58.360 --> 01:33:59.680
whenever you'd like, here on air.

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.480
We appreciate you, we appreciate your time, and thank you so much for coming on on short

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:04.480
notice.

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:08.560
Inshallah, Alex, and if I'm still alive, I'll come back on Monday and tell you a little

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:09.560
bit more.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:12.720
All right, me too, I hear you.

01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:13.720
You'll be fine.

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:19.320
This just reminds me of the Jerome Corsi might die over the weekend, he's got a dead man

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.320
switch.

01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:22.840
Yeah, oh man.

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:26.020
No I can't come back on Monday, Alex, it's going to take me at least another week to

01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:27.020
write the...

01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:34.040
I mean, I can't remember, oh no, I have an eidetic memory, I mean, it's, oooh, vacation!

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.040
Smoke bomb.

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:39.320
Yeah, so that was an interesting kind of, I don't know, change of pace.

01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:40.320
Little jaunt.

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:41.320
Yeah, jaunt is good.

01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:42.320
Yeah, it was a nice little jaunt.

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:44.040
Yeah, I found that to be just...

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:48.760
I feel like I got took down the garden path for a nice little walk, and now we've come

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:50.800
back to the house and we shall return.

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:57.600
I also like the idea, too, that this Patrick guy is clearly someone who has some status,

01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.680
at least in his own mind.

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:04.600
He'll tell Alex, you stepped on my punchline, I'm going to say these things.

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:05.880
Like he's not, he's...

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:06.960
I've made a lot of money.

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:10.640
He has a little bit of flex on him, which is kind of fun.

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:11.640
That is.

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:16.860
But I also was thinking, like, all right, this guy's clearly a little nutty.

01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:19.660
Is he the new Larry?

01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:21.300
Is he the new Larry Nichols?

01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:22.680
He's got a Clinton conspiracy.

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:23.680
That would be good.

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:24.680
Yeah.

01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:26.640
I wonder, here's what I wonder.

01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:29.720
Wait, Stevie Pease wasn't on today, right?

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:30.720
No.

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:31.720
No.

01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:34.520
I'm wondering when exactly Stevie Pease is coming back.

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.120
Probably tomorrow, I don't know.

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.320
No, that's what I'm saying.

01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:41.280
What if there's a larger thing going on between Stevie and David Knight?

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.280
There may be.

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:45.480
And now Steve's not even going to be coming back for a little while, so we got Overstock

01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:49.520
guy to try and thread the needle of a Steve and a David Knight.

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.520
Oh my God.

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:52.960
He has so much of the Steve and so much of the Larry.

01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:53.960
Exactly.

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:54.960
All in one.

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:55.960
Yep.

01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:56.960
Put them in one.

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:57.960
Yeah, I don't know.

01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:02.520
It's tough for me because, you know, we get blindsided by this news about the David Knight.

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:07.040
And then, you know, as I look into the episode itself, you know, you find that, oh, maybe

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.300
there's massive downsizing.

01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:17.280
Or maybe this is yet again Alex overplaying some kind of desperation in order to move

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:18.280
product.

01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:19.280
Who knows?

01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:20.280
I don't know.

01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:21.280
I have no idea what's going on there.

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.360
Things don't look good.

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:28.920
And it makes me even more suspicious when the day before, there's really no indication

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:29.920
of anything.

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:30.920
Yeah.

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:31.920
There's no trouble.

01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:32.920
Yeah.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:37.840
He's promoting the countdown, election countdown show that now apparently can't continue.

01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:38.840
Yeah.

01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:39.840
It's weird.

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:41.360
It's, it's a, it's a little bit out of nowhere.

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:46.640
Here's my, here's my pitch on, here's my conspiracy now.

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:48.880
This is what I've got for you on this whole thing.

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:49.880
All right.

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:52.840
Uh, Info Wars, not doing great right now.

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:55.640
Not going to go out of business, but they're not doing great right now.

01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.640
Sure.

01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:57.640
Okay.

01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:00.660
And these months, uh, this, this little couple of weeks, you know what, everybody takes a

01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:02.560
Christmas vacation.

01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:06.840
And if you took a Christmas vacation, that wouldn't be that exciting.

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:10.520
We're in the middle of fighting the goddamn Info War, you know, you can't just go out

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:11.520
on vacation.

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:12.520
I see what you're doing.

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:15.320
So what we do is we say, we got to let you go.

01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:19.280
I save money on overhead costs for a couple of weeks.

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:23.400
After the big Christmas sale, we get all, oh, for sure.

01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:25.540
After the big Christmas sale, we get all the money in.

01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:29.520
And then I'm like, guys, we're bringing David Knight back!

01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:31.280
And we've retooled his show.

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:32.280
Exactly.

01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:33.280
Huh?

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.280
Yeah.

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:35.280
That would be interesting.

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:36.280
That would be interesting.

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:37.280
That would be interesting either.

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:38.280
Yeah.

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:42.320
I am interested to see what ends up happening, uh, but not that interested.

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:43.320
Sure.

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.320
I'm torn.

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:47.040
I want them to do some work to make me interested in it.

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.040
Yes.

01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:49.040
Yeah.

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.040
Make me care.

01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:51.040
Make me care.

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:52.040
Fight.

01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:53.040
Do something for my amusement.

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:56.920
The other thing too that I think is really key is that, like, Alex is about to enter

01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:02.320
a very profitable space, which is returning to the attacking the GOP.

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:03.320
Right.

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:10.320
His purity in the GOP kind of thing is a really, really profitable sector for, like, right-wing

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:11.320
talk shows.

01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:12.320
Oh yeah.

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:13.320
It's worked for millions of years.

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.320
Right.

01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:22.320
But he also has never had to do it while there were large funded, uh, competitors.

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.320
Yeah.

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:26.520
And I don't know if he can, uh, beat OAM.

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:27.520
Yeah.

01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:32.760
It's difficult whenever you also have, like, because before you had Fox News crashing the

01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:38.040
Tea Party wing, just like, fuck yeah, let's ride or die on killing everybody.

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:42.920
But Alex even then still got to exist in that space of, like, everybody sucks and I hate

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:46.560
them all, but Obama's the devil and, you know, that whole thing.

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:50.360
But Fox News wasn't also hating Mitch McConnell at the time.

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:55.560
No, they did have Glenn Beck being a little nutty, a little conspiracy-ish, but, like-

01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:59.400
But Glenn Beck didn't have two networks that they were competing, you know, you know what

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:00.400
I'm saying?

01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:01.400
Right, right.

01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:02.400
Yeah.

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.400
There was some competition in the form of Glenn Beck, but Alex was still, like, he would

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:08.520
say a lot of shit that Glenn Beck probably wouldn't.

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:09.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.080
And so, I don't know.

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:16.960
I don't know substantially what he can do to differentiate himself from the competitors

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:19.360
now, but- A good job I think is the only thing he could

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.160
do and I don't think he's capable of that.

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:22.160
Don't think it's possible.

01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:23.160
No.

01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:25.360
Based on this interview with the Overstock guy, I don't think it's possible.

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.240
I don't think we're seeing that kind of turnaround.

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:28.240
Certainly not.

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.240
It's a Christmas miracle!

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:30.240
No.

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:31.240
Uh, we'll be back, folks.

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:33.440
But until then, we have a website.

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:34.440
We do have a website.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.440
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:36.440
We're also on Twitter.

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:37.440
We are on Twitter.

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:38.440
It's at knowledgefight.com.

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:39.440
Now go to Betjordan.

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.440
We're also on Facebook.

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.440
We are Facebook.

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:44.800
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out those doing

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:45.800
God's work right now.

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:46.800
Yeah, we'll be back.

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:47.800
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:48.800
I'm Leo.

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:49.800
I'm DZXClark.

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.800
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:53.400
I'm more like out of stock.com.

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:54.400
Andy in Kansas.

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:55.400
You're on the air.

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:56.400
Thanks for holding.

01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:57.400
Hello, Alex.

01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:58.400
I'm a first time caller.

01:39:58.400 --> 01:39:59.400
I'm a huge fan.

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:00.400
I love your work.

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:01.400
I love you.
