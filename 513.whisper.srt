00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,160
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys, knowledgefight.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,080
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:55,760
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us.

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,760
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan.

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,760
I love your work.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,760
I love you.

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,760
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
I'm Dan.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
I'm Jordan.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,760
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,760
bit about Alex Jones.

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,760
Oh indeed we are Dan.

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,760
Yes.

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,760
Dan?

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
Yes.

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
Quick question for you.

23
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
What's up Jordan?

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
What's your bright spot today?

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,680
My bright spot today is that wonderful intersection of aspiration and limitations.

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,160
All right, are you talking about finishing an entire Waffle House meal?

27
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,160
No.

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:30,560
I got some sheet metal from the local hardware store the other day because it dawned on me

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,240
that I love breakfast sandwiches and I can make them myself if I could make eggs round.

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,600
And I was like, if I just get some sheet metal, I could make a round thing that I could put

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
in a pan.

32
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,080
You're making your own cutouts.

33
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,320
You're making cookie cutters.

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Basically, yeah.

35
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Out of sheet metal.

36
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Yep.

37
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
You can just buy them.

38
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,720
Well, that's the limitations aspect.

39
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,920
So I spent a while cutting up some metal and I didn't cut myself or anything, so that's

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
a plus.

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
Well that's good.

42
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
That's a plus.

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,220
But yeah, I got through a couple trials of it and you know, like the egg kept seeping

44
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,680
out from under it because it's not perfectly, it's like, ah, what can I do?

45
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
How can I fix this?

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,840
And so I Googled it and I was like, oh, they cost eight bucks for four of them.

47
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Oh yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
It costs nothing.

49
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
I was like, okay, I'll just order those.

50
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,160
I have no idea why you bought, why did you buy sheet metal?

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,800
What was your thought process on that?

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,080
I was taking a walk to get out of the house and I saw the hardware store and I like the

53
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,560
hardware guys and I was like, oh, I've been, I had that thought about round eggs.

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,120
Why don't I see if they have anything I could, uh, sheet metal in there?

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,960
And so I did and well, it felt fun.

56
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Yeah.

57
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,480
The aspiration phase felt really fun.

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,480
Like I'm being crafty.

59
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,520
I'm trying to build something and I did succeed.

60
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,720
It just wasn't that good.

61
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
Sure.

62
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
I made something that worked.

63
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,240
I made egg patties.

64
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
Sure.

65
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,560
They just weren't great and they did leak a little bit.

66
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
But they were round.

67
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,720
You win some, you lose some.

68
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Right.

69
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
I think that's great.

70
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,600
I consider it a partial victory that I then forfeited to buying a couple.

71
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
I agree.

72
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,200
I think that you even tried to construct your own as a victory in and of itself.

73
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Yeah.

74
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
I feel better.

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,360
I feel better for trying, but also qualified success, qualified success.

76
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,000
I think you are though technically a weekend warrior now, Dan.

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I have that urge.

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah.

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah.

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah.

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's what you do.

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yep.

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I need a sink to fix.

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I need a, I need these projects.

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
To fail on.

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm going to build a god damn chair.

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,920
I'm going to build a god damn chair today.

89
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,360
I'm going to try really hard and then I'm going to buy a chair.

90
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
That's my weekend.

91
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
Yeah.

92
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,340
It's a good thing you don't have any like trimming to do because you would have a series

93
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,880
of chainsaws and shit.

94
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,880
That would be a nightmare.

95
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
No, probably not.

96
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,640
I'd probably stop just short of that.

97
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
What's your bright spot?

98
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,720
My bright spot, Dan, is a, I don't know if you recall, do you remember a few weeks ago

99
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,000
when I talked to you about the Mandalorian?

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Um, yeah.

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah.

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,800
And it was, what I said to you was that it was, it was essentially, it was like a, it's,

103
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
it's junk food.

104
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,200
You know, it's everything you want, you know?

105
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,640
And the season finale was such that it was just, I can't even, without spoilers, I can't

106
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,680
even begin to describe it because it was like I could feel myself in the writer's room.

107
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,080
Did they say that Baby Yoda's name isn't Grogu?

108
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,640
No, but if only they could.

109
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,800
I thought I would figure that would be a nice twist.

110
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,800
It would be nice if the twist ending, the person who arrived was like, nah, nah, nah,

111
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,280
nah, nah, nah, you're Baby Yoda.

112
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Moving on.

113
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,840
Let's get out of here.

114
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
Grogu is dead.

115
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
Long live Baby Yoda.

116
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
Yeah, exactly.

117
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,160
But it was very much like a, I didn't, I knew it was possible, but I never thought they

118
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
would do it.

119
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Okay.

120
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,480
Have you, I think I would liken it to, have you ever seen a wrestling pay-per-view, perhaps

121
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
when you were younger?

122
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
Yes.

123
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,020
Where all of a sudden you heard the music and you were like, oh shit, they did it!

124
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,920
You hear the glass break and Stone Cold comes out.

125
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,720
Exactly, and Stone Cold comes out and you're like, I didn't think it was going to be Stone

126
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,640
Cold and it was him!

127
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,520
It's like that, but if your childhood came back and kicked you in the dick.

128
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,520
Okay.

129
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
Well, it's fantastic.

130
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,400
I have no idea what you're talking about and I'm glad you enjoyed it.

131
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

132
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,060
I'm sorry I didn't make anything.

133
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,040
So technically I barely did.

134
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Yeah, that's fair.

135
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,000
Today we've got an interesting episode to go over, Jordan.

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,920
We're talking about Friday of last week, which would be the 18th of December, 2020.

137
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
I'm Dan.

138
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
This is 2020.

139
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,960
Hey, that's good news!

140
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,560
This is an interesting thing.

141
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,560
It's a thing?

142
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Yes.

143
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
All right.

144
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,960
And we'll get into exactly why it's an interesting thing.

145
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,220
I'm not saying an episode.

146
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,900
Is that David Knight's music being played in the background?

147
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,900
Glass breaks.

148
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,440
As David Knight comes to- Oh shit!

149
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
We're back!

150
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Oh my God!

151
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,160
David Knight has parted the Red Sea!

152
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,640
And now it's time to bring back my show where I will talk for three hours or so.

153
00:05:53,640 --> 00:06:00,480
No, that is, David Knight does not make an appearance, although we might learn a few

154
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
things.

155
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,240
I'm going to actually have a request for you taking notes throughout this episode that

156
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,000
we'll get to here in a few.

157
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,620
But before we do that, let's take a moment to say thank you to some folks who have signed

158
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,620
up and are supporting the show.

159
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,620

178
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,100
You are now a policy wonk.

179
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,100
I'm a policy wonk.

180
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,100
Thank you, Adam.

181
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,100
Thank you, Adam!

182
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,100
No last initial at all.

183
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,100
No last initial at all?

184
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,100
Mm-hmm.

185
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,100
It was the first Adam?

186
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Yeah.

187
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,100
Holy shit!

188
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
Yep.

189
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,100
Next, Laura C., thank you so much.

190
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
You are now a policy wonk.

191
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,100
I'm a policy wonk.

192
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100
Thanks, Laura!

193
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
Thank you!

194
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,100
And then finally, let's say thank you to a couple of people who donated on elevated

195
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,380
love and we appreciate that very much.

196
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,500
So first, Larry Klayman for Supreme Court, thank you so much.

197
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,000
You are now a technocrat.

198
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,620
And Mean Blackbird, thank you so much.

199
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,140
You are now a technocrat.

200
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,140
I'm a policy wonk.

201
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,140
Crikey, mate.

202
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,140
That's fantastic.

203
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,140
Have yourself a brew.

204
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,140
How's your 401k doing, bro?

205
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,140
All right.

206
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,140
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

207
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,700
Let's just get down to business.

208
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,760
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

209
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,700
Why are you pimps so good?

210
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,340
My neck is freakishly large.

211
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,100
I declare info war on you.

212
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,100
Thank you so much, Larry Klayman for Supreme Court and thank you so much, Mean Blackbird.

213
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Yes.

214
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,100
Thank you very much to the both of you.

215
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Yes.

216
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,100
If you're out there listening and thinking, hey, I enjoy the show.

217
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,100
I'd like support with these gents.

218
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,980
You can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com, clicking the button to support the show

219
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,980
or.

220
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,060
Oh, what you could do is take a look at your little spaceship.

221
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,860
You could hop in that little spaceship with the intent of solving many problems.

222
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,180
And when you arrive at your destination, you can tear apart everyone in your path trying

223
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:58,100
to keep you from expressing your generosity by going to a local bail fund or charity.

224
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,060
Give your generosity to Grogu.

225
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,060
Yes.

226
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,180
Give your Grogu to a local charity in your area.

227
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,700
I like the idea of you starting over watching The Mandalorian again, just staring at him,

228
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,700
just going Grogu.

229
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
You're fucking Grogu?

230
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,300
You're Grogu?

231
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,500
You can't experience it unless you don't know his name.

232
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Yeah.

233
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,540
I don't pick I'll ever watch it.

234
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,540
Yeah, I know.

235
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,620
I'm interested in seeing Werner Herzog's delightful performance.

236
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,620
It's fantastic.

237
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:32,700
I'm excited about some of the screenshots I've seen of the child will be something incredible.

238
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,700
Yeah.

239
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,700
I would like to.

240
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,700
And now I can't.

241
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,700
Yeah.

242
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Grogu.

243
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,700
Yeah.

244
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,140
Unfortunately, his name is Grogu.

245
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,740
Grogu has celebrated 50 birthdays, from what I understand.

246
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,740
Is that correct?

247
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,740
Yes, it is.

248
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,140
Someone who's celebrating a birthday today.

249
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,140
Nicely done.

250
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,100
We'd like to give a shout out to Wendy.

251
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
Happy birthday, Wendy.

252
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,700
Happy birthday, Wendy.

253
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,140
Wendy informed us that her last name was Grogu?

254
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,140
No.

255
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,300
Birthday on Monday, and it's the shortest day of the year.

256
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,580
I know we had some dispute about day lengths a while back.

257
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,460
Oh, it is the winter solstice.

258
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,180
So happy solstice and happy birthday, Wendy.

259
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,180
Yes, indeed.

260
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,180
I hope you are a witch.

261
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,660
Oh, boy.

262
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,580
So Jordan, today, like I said, we got a thing to go over.

263
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,580
And that is going to be a lot of Alex.

264
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,300
Because Alex Jones did double duty on Friday.

265
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,300
Of course.

266
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,380
He hosted David Knight's show and then his own show.

267
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,160
Oh, God.

268
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,060
So here is an out of context drop from Alex.

269
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,060
You understand?

270
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,700
You've got to scare the living hell out of your kids.

271
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,700
Okay.

272
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,700
All right.

273
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700
Okay.

274
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
Good parenting advice from Alex.

275
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,700
No, that's good.

276
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,700
That's good.

277
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Always got to appreciate that.

278
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,200
That was, I believe, scarecrow's policy.

279
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,300
Spare the scarecrow, spoil the child.

280
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,740
Scare the child, don't spoil.

281
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,300
I don't know how to do this.

282
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:58,300
So Alex hosted his own broadcast, the Alex Jones show, trademark, copyright free, anyone

283
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
can use it, whatever.

284
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,300
Who cares?

285
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,300
No problem.

286
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:06,380
Before that, because he had fired David Knight the day before, he needed to fill that time.

287
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,380
Sure.

288
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,380
Something had to go there.

289
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:13,260
And so what he decided to do was finally do that show that was mostly callers.

290
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,260
Okay.

291
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,900
So he's decided he's going to start a new show called The American Journal.

292
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,740
Get the fuck out of here.

293
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,840
The American Journal.

294
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,900
It's a parody.

295
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
I say it's a parody.

296
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,540
He would say it's an homage to The Washington Journal on C-SPAN.

297
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:34,380
And he says that about a hundred times throughout the three hour show.

298
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,380
I don't think his audience would get the reference otherwise.

299
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,140
He does really hammer it home.

300
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,540
It's like a Washington Journal, but it's America.

301
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,860
We've never seen C-SPAN.

302
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,980
So here is an out of context drop from one of the callers on The American Journal.

303
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,420
All these people that think that this COVID shot is going to cure them or even make them

304
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,740
into a cyborg human being.

305
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
They're wrong.

306
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,740
It is not.

307
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,740
It is going to kill them.

308
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,740
Oh.

309
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,840
Getting the pulse of America.

310
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,860
That is The American Journal.

311
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,460
I think that would be a fairly good chronicle of our times.

312
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,460
Yeah.

313
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,740
All these people out there who think the shot's going to turn them into a cyborg.

314
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,740
They're wrong.

315
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,740
Idiots.

316
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,540
They're so goddamn stupid, they think they're going to turn into a cyborg.

317
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,540
God, we're taking the time to hear these missives.

318
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:25,180
We've got to debunk all of these falsehoods that are going around, Dan.

319
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,980
So here's Alex starting off the Journal.

320
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,740
And the Journal starts earlier.

321
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,720
Alex is used to starting his show at 11.

322
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,120
This one starts at 8.

323
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
That's too early.

324
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,240
Yeah, so he's in there early.

325
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,960
You're listening to The American Journal with your host, Alex Jones.

326
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,700
Watch it live right now at band.video.

327
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:54,100
All right, folks, we are live on this Friday transmission.

328
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:03,460
Thank you so much for joining us on this December 17th broadcast.

329
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,460
So much going on.

330
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,460
There's so much happening.

331
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,460
I work seven days a week.

332
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,140
I'm not even sure what day it is anymore.

333
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,660
Makes my head spin.

334
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,660
It's the 18th.

335
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,660
Yeah.

336
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,660
Yeah.

337
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,660
It does.

338
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,660
That's not an auspicious beginning.

339
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:22,220
No, it does sound like he's already taking his time to run up the clock.

340
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,220
Already stalling.

341
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,140
Minute one of The American Journal.

342
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:34,820
Ladies and gentlemen, we begin our...

343
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,820
From a place.

344
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Show.

345
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,900
In the middle of America.

346
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,940
We're going to take calls.

347
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,340
I'm going to say a million fucking times that this is like The Washington Journal, but I'm

348
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,340
doing it.

349
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,340
It's going to be a while.

350
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,380
I'm going to complain a whole bunch.

351
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,180
John Rappaport's going to host the last half hour because I got to take a break in between

352
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,380
this and my show.

353
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,380
Yeah.

354
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,380
Six hours straight is a lot.

355
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,480
The whole show's supposed to be about taking calls and the last half hour is John Rappaport

356
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
not taking calls.

357
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
Hey, come on.

358
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,740
He's John Rappaport.

359
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,000
He's not on his feet, man.

360
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's ridiculous.

361
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No.

362
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,420
So anyway, Alex realizes that it's the 18th.

363
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:18,860
Now, I told the guys months ago, I had an idea, told the crew for something like a...

364
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,460
Let's buy another tank.

365
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,260
National Journal program based on The Washington Journal.

366
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,260
And that's what we're doing right now.

367
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,500
It is Friday, December 18th, 2020.

368
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,540
I was looking up there on the computer board and it said December 17th, 2020.

369
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,420
And I said, that's not right.

370
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,860
It's Friday, December 18th, but of course, that's why you can't always trust computers,

371
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,860
can you?

372
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,060
Sometimes computers lie to you.

373
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,540
You need to be aware of this.

374
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:50,800
Wait, is The Washington Journal the one where it's the guy who is steadfast in his not having

375
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,880
a facial expression?

376
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,780
Like somebody calls in and they're like, I think dogs are going to own this world.

377
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,420
And he's like, that was a good call.

378
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,420
The next caller.

379
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,420
And they have the Republican and Democrat independent lines.

380
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,420
Yes, yes.

381
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,420
That's the show.

382
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,420
All right.

383
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:10,060
Alex thinks he's capable of doing that and boy, I will tell you from round one, he is

384
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,060
not.

385
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,060
All right.

386
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,980
So flappable he is, un he is not.

387
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,660
I just, I mean like it would be like if The Washington Journal host constantly like forgot

388
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,260
why he was there.

389
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,540
That would, that's kind of the way you would make it meet.

390
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,540
All right.

391
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,540
I like it.

392
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,540
But the aspiration is there.

393
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,940
Much like me trying to make these egg rounds.

394
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,940
Sure.

395
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,940
Alex intends to take 90% calls.

396
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,260
So here we are and I told the crew months ago that I wanted to launch a show either

397
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:46,740
in the morning or at night and call it National Journal, kind of after The Washington Journal

398
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,380
to really habituate myself or whoever the host would be, I thought of it kind of as

399
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,540
a rotating group of hosts, to take a lot of phone calls and actually do it every day because

400
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,620
the show is based at least 90% on phone calls.

401
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:09,820
And so that is what we are doing here on this live Friday, December 18th, 2020 broadcast.

402
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:15,420
I will give Alex some credit and say that it's more calls than you'd expect based on

403
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,420
his history.

404
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,420
Sure.

405
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,420
It's still not 90%.

406
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,420
Well.

407
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,300
It's not, it's, and some of them are talking about how you're not going to turn into a

408
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,300
cyborg.

409
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,660
So then some of them you might as well not have.

410
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,660
That's fair.

411
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,420
And one of them is a guy named Mountain Patriot.

412
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,420
Okay.

413
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,420
Yeah.

414
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,420
Was that his birth name?

415
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,420
Yeah.

416
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,420
Yeah.

417
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,420
It's on his birth certificate.

418
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,420
All right.

419
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,420
Well, that's good.

420
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,420
On his new birth certificate that he got when he became a sovereign.

421
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,420
Yeah.

422
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,420
Okay.

423
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,420
Well, that's fair.

424
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,420
So here's where I want to make a request of you taking notes.

425
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,420
Sure.

426
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,620
A large portion of this turns into Alex complaining about David Knight.

427
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:54,940
There is a large part of this episode is like Alex being kind of too aware that people are

428
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,420
going to tune in thinking it's David Knight's show.

429
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,420
What happened?

430
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,420
Yeah.

431
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,060
So we have to kind of address the issue.

432
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:08,380
Now on the 17th, the episode that we listened to on our last episode, we heard him give

433
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,380
the explanation that it's money.

434
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,380
It's money.

435
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,380
Right.

436
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,380
Right, right, right.

437
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,380
We got financial troubles around here.

438
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,380
Right.

439
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,380
We have to scale back and get leaner.

440
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,380
Yeah.

441
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,460
So write that down at the top of your notes.

442
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:26,100
So we're about to find out that it's actually about the number of emails David Knight sent?

443
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,380
No, that doesn't come into it.

444
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,380
Okay.

445
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,380
All right.

446
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,020
And maybe Steve Puchenik related.

447
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,020
Sure.

448
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,300
Because the two of them got into a bit of a beef.

449
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,300
They got a tiff.

450
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,300
Although also I'm a little reticent about that, or I had to been.

451
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Right.

452
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,140
I want you to keep track of...

453
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,100
How many different possible reasons there?

454
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,100
Yes.

455
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,100
Okay.

456
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,100
I have to write down each new one.

457
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,700
I want you to listen carefully and see how many different stories about why David got

458
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,340
fired you could come up with.

459
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,180
He did an upper decker in the toilet and I just can't do it anymore.

460
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,340
I wish it was that interesting.

461
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,340
Yeah, that would be fun.

462
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,340
So here's the first one.

463
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,820
I'm going to give you this as a layout.

464
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,820
Okay.

465
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,580
Now, a lot of you are probably tuning in and you're saying, where's David Knight?

466
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,580
I love David Knight.

467
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,580
I really care about him.

468
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,820
He's a talented, smart guy.

469
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:13,260
He's been with us nine years and I personally am exhausted doing my own show every day.

470
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,300
And David, of course, took off quite a bit over a year ago with some medical issues and

471
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,860
came back.

472
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:29,340
And I just made the decision that David was not happy here.

473
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
I made the decision.

474
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,980
That it was not good for him to still be on air.

475
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,700
That's my own personal decision.

476
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,140
I was kind of watching him twist in the wind, very depressed with everything that's going

477
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,980
on, very, very upset.

478
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,980
And I agree with about 95% of what David has to say and what he does.

479
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,460
I did not let David go because I disagreed with what he was doing or because he didn't

480
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,060
agree with me on some things that had nothing to do with it.

481
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,580
So that had nothing to do with it.

482
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,860
It had everything to do with the fact that David Knight was unhappy by Alex's metric.

483
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,980
Alex determined that David was unhappy, but he couldn't save himself.

484
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,540
David Knight was too stubborn to leave the job when he was miserable.

485
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,740
And so Alex did it for him, gave him the ax.

486
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,980
Really, Alex is the good guy.

487
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,020
Yeah, that doesn't sound right, but okay.

488
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,540
Alex is your best friend that you think you don't need.

489
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:20,100
I just don't think we're going to find out that this is a consistent storyline.

490
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,700
I think I might have ruined that by setting up your note.

491
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,260
Could be, could be.

492
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,180
So one other possibility for why he might've gotten the ax is that Alex wanted to do this

493
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,180
call-in show and David did not.

494
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:40,540
I have wanted to launch, again, a program like Washington Journal, but National Journal.

495
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,340
David was not interested in a program like that.

496
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,860
We had, you know, first wanted to have a show that he would host that was, was calls and

497
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,520
yes and things, but he had total control over a show and it went another direction.

498
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,140
So here we are.

499
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,340
And when I host the show or when Owen hosted or when Harrison hosted or when other people

500
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,720
were looking at bringing in to host it, host it, if it's not a call-in show, then that

501
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,300
person won't be hosting it anymore.

502
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,360
So I've kind of gotten in a rut, not in a bad way, but it's a rut that I don't take

503
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,620
enough calls.

504
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,680
And I've gotten in a rut that I don't play enough clips and I've gotten in a rut that

505
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,220
I tend to get on one story and pontificate on it for an hour.

506
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:23,140
And that's somewhat informative for diehard listeners, but it's not for radio and TV stations

507
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,820
to really cover some quick news, get into it, take calls, have a quick guest and really

508
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,980
cycle through a lot of information.

509
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,140
And so that's what this show is going to be.

510
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,740
It's going to be your phone calls.

511
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,580
I agree with Alex on some level that his show is inaccessible to people who aren't already

512
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,580
indoctrinated.

513
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,580
I do agree with that.

514
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,580
Yes.

515
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,300
The format that he has is not good for someone like clicking around on the radio.

516
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Right, right, right, right.

517
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,460
It might be able to grab your attention with a guy yelling, but he doesn't yell all the

518
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,460
time.

519
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,460
Yeah.

520
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,380
There's a lot of stretches of time that are completely boring, stupid shit.

521
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,380
Sure.

522
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,780
And you know, if you aren't already on the team, you're not going to give a shit about

523
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,780
that.

524
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,780
I mean, there's that.

525
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,140
And also the mythology has just moved on so much from reality.

526
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,140
Boy has it.

527
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:13,340
Like, what are you, like, you're, you're coming in on like episode 40 of the 38th season.

528
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,340
Yeah.

529
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,180
You're not going to catch up with all that's happened before.

530
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,900
I listen to this all the time and sometimes I lose track of the lore.

531
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Exactly.

532
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,900
It's nonsense.

533
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,900
Yes, exactly.

534
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,900
Yeah.

535
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,900
Yeah.

536
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,420
I, yeah, it would be something that would be very, very difficult for you to get people

537
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,420
in the door.

538
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,420
Right.

539
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,420
And I understand that.

540
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,420
And I think our show probably is the same.

541
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,420
Yeah.

542
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,420
So I kind of empathize with Alex.

543
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,420
Totally.

544
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,580
And, um, you know, if he needs to switch up his format in order to maybe cater to an audience

545
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,100
that he can trick into buying pills, great, good for him.

546
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,940
I'm going to stick with what we got.

547
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,000
I would, I would also say that David is smart for not wanting to do a call-in show just

548
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,420
simply because you've also cultivated an audience that you don't want to hear what they have

549
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,420
to say.

550
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,420
It's true.

551
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,420
It's true.

552
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,780
You would, like, if you're David Knight and you try and pretend like you take this all

553
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,780
very seriously and you're a, you're a, you're a thinker, you think Steve Pachenik's full

554
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,780
of shit.

555
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,780
So you clearly have some standards.

556
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,740
You're trying to enforce something.

557
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,560
You lose credibility by having to humor idiots.

558
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,300
And David Knight's probably too polite to tell people to shut up.

559
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,980
People who think they're going to be cyborgs are stupid.

560
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,980
They're going to die.

561
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,500
Um, oh, I, I mean, uh, uh, I am a cyborg.

562
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
What?

563
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,220
So, uh, you got a lot of calls coming up.

564
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,220
Okay.

565
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,820
And we're going to be taking a lot of your phone calls.

566
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,100
So I'll give you the number when we come back.

567
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:43,260
And part of taking phone calls is going to be, we are going to get to your call and move

568
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,260
the next person.

569
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,700
So I'm not going to do, thank you for calling and go, thank you so much, Alex.

570
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
Oh.

571
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,700
And then get into what you have to say.

572
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,060
We're just going to, Hey, you're calling in.

573
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,060
Here's the topic.

574
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,020
We'll, we'll talk about a topic, an hour, another topic, the next hour.

575
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,120
And that's how this is going to be something that I haven't really done personally in this

576
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,420
style over 20 years.

577
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,060
And so thank you for joining us for American journal.

578
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,540
We'll be right back.

579
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,940
Listen to this mellow ass music.

580
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,940
Yeah.

581
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,940
Yeah.

582
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,940
This is very strange.

583
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,940
This is real.

584
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Eight in the morning.

585
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,940
Got out some coffee.

586
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,500
This is dissonant to hear Alex like, Oh, I haven't been awake before nine and 20 years.

587
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,180
It's surreal on a lot of levels.

588
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:28,540
Uh, just sitting there with like a calm show.

589
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,540
Yeah.

590
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,540
Yeah.

591
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,540
Just sitting there with a calm.

592
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,540
That's very funny.

593
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,140
So Alex starts off after he gets back from the commercial with introducing the first

594
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,700
topic and the way he wants to do this is he wants to have an hour block and then it's

595
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,140
so he has like, all right, we have our first topic.

596
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,620
We're taking calls on that topic next hour.

597
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,980
I'll introduce another topic.

598
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,540
We'll take calls on that topic.

599
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,540
Sure.

600
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,540
And I got a framework.

601
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:55,680
I'm not sure if it works out the way he wants it to, but here is the first topic.

602
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,620
And she passes out and falls to ground had to be taken out later on a stretcher.

603
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,380
So he's, he just, I forgot.

604
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:07,260
He had played a clip, uh, from Tennessee of a nurse who was giving a, uh, little bit of

605
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:12,780
a talk to reporters after getting the vaccine for COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine.

606
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,100
And she, uh, fainted after, uh, while she was talking to reporters.

607
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Okay.

608
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
Okay.

609
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,360
And so Alex played the audio of that, but it was really bad.

610
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,020
So I had to start this after, uh, the, uh, the auto is, it was just unlistenable.

611
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,380
And she passes out and falls to the ground had to be taken out later on a stretcher.

612
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:34,980
And they put out a press release on local ABC news saying, Oh, it's quite normal to

613
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,040
collapse like this when you take any vaccine.

614
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,380
So this video of the nurse in Tennessee was circulating on social media.

615
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,340
And man, it has all of the optics you wouldn't want.

616
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,540
If you're trying to reassure people about the safety of a COVID vaccine, but it's still

617
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,920
something that's being used dishonestly nurse, Tiffany Dover was answering questions from

618
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,460
reporters about getting the vaccine.

619
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,360
At which point she said she was feeling dizzy and momentarily fainted.

620
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,940
She later explained that she has a condition where she faints when she feels pain.

621
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,060
And it was unlikely something caused by the vaccine.

622
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,780
Alex is also just lying about the video and making up details about it.

623
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,120
Most glaringly that she had to be carried out on a stretcher.

624
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,180
According to the associated press quote, Dover was back on her feet shortly after passing

625
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,180
out.

626
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,100
As it turns out, this is just a reaction that some people have to any kind of shot.

627
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,420
And most doctors believe that it's related to pain or anxiety.

628
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,040
You could easily see someone with a history of fainting when experiencing pain, having

629
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,340
that amplified by the anxiety of being on news, getting one of the first vaccines for

630
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,180
a pandemic that should fucking up everyone's life for about a year.

631
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:40,660
But I do grant that the optics are not what you'd want here at all.

632
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,160
If you're just someone who doesn't care about details and go off emotional reactions to

633
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,500
surface level appearances, then this would be very powerful in terms of painting the

634
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,740
vaccine as dangerous, which I guess is the first topic for the American Journal.

635
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,140
Yeah, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna say that it wouldn't be a smarter idea not to have

636
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:03,460
a Southern belle from the 1870s take the first vaccine.

637
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,820
Oh my God, this vaccine.

638
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:12,300
But I will say that when I got the hepatitis vaccine before I went to South Africa with

639
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,820
my partner, I passed out.

640
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,120
Like I was sitting on the chair and I had to go down on the ground and lay on the floor

641
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,700
because it was such a huge vaccine too.

642
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,460
So it was a, yeah, yeah.

643
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,700
I've not had that experience, but I've definitely seen it.

644
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,100
And I know that some people like when they give blood, they can have a chance of passing

645
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:37,980
out or, or even like when you see people giving blood or whatever the shock of, of that some,

646
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:43,420
some people get a lot of response to it and it has nothing to do with what's in the syringe

647
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,420
usually.

648
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,220
So anyway, but there's more to be worried about with this vaccine.

649
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,080
I guess this is also what Alex wants to talk about.

650
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,900
You know, it says on the inserts that it can kill you.

651
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,220
This is not a normal vaccine.

652
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,220
It's even worse.

653
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,780
It's an M RNA vaccine that actually goes in and reprograms every major cell group in your

654
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,300
body to produce quote proteins that block the virus.

655
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,420
Those same proteins happen to be in the placenta.

656
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:12,660
And so it also blocks having a baby and they had sure, sure toss that in children for a

657
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,660
couple of years.

658
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:19,140
When you take some of the M RNA vaccines actually have the medical reports from big pharma and

659
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,180
the trials here in my stack today.

660
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,860
Yes, this isn't a conspiracy theory.

661
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,040
This is a fact.

662
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,620
So what Alex is talking about there is complete nonsense.

663
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:33,620
He was recently yelling about the six deaths in the Pfizer trials, which we discussed on

664
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,980
a recent episode and four were in the placebo group and two were most likely not caused

665
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,980
by the vaccine.

666
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,160
Totally that breakdown that they released, which included that information is probably

667
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,380
one of the best resources for information about the effects that have been documented

668
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,980
in persons who have been given the vaccine.

669
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,700
And Alex says that he has this in his stack, he references this material.

670
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,820
In that very document, they say that quote at the time of the data cut off, which was

671
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:03,660
November 14th, 2020, a total of 23 participants had reported pregnancies in the safety database,

672
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,900
including nine participants who withdrew from the study due to pregnancies.

673
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,860
There's demographic information about the 43,000 people who were enrolled in the study.

674
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:16,700
And I considered trying to whittle it down to see if 23 was a notably high or low number

675
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,540
of pregnancies to see in that size group.

676
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,600
But honestly, it would have been impossible to tell from the given information.

677
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,940
You can make some general assumptions, but even if you're able to get a vague number

678
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,740
of the population in the study who are able to get pregnant and of a likely age where

679
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,260
they might, that still doesn't really help.

680
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,820
You still have no idea how many of these people are sexually active, how many were using birth

681
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,460
control, et cetera.

682
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,980
Without access to any of that data, it seems to me that 23 pregnancies is a fairly normal

683
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,980
number.

684
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,180
And it also contradicts all of Alex's bullshit.

685
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,620
Aren't you sick of all these fact checkers, Dan?

686
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,620
I hate them.

687
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:53,300
A more important piece of info we can take from that Pfizer report is from table 23 towards

688
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:58,160
the end of the report, which details serious adverse events experienced in the study.

689
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:03,140
There was one spontaneous abortion that occurred in that group of 43,000 participants, which

690
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,860
was the only pregnancy or perinatal complication or condition that was reported.

691
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,580
This was someone in the placebo group, so it was not caused by the vaccine.

692
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,580
Okay.

693
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,580
All right.

694
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,020
This is a meme that Alex has seen that suggests that the vaccine will cause infertility, but

695
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,300
it's a load of shit.

696
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,420
The basic idea is that the spike protein used in the vaccine is the same as the protein

697
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,480
that's used by the body to create a placenta, so the vaccine would train your body to attack

698
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,580
the very thing you'd need to develop in order to become pregnant.

699
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:36,620
The protein is called syncytin-1, but the problem boils down to an elementary misunderstanding

700
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,020
on the part of these viral meme makers.

701
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:44,580
The vaccine uses a spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which does share a small sequence of amino

702
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:50,900
acid with syncytin-1, but it's not close enough at all in similarity to cause the kind of

703
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,220
reaction that Alex is suggesting.

704
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,220
Sure.

705
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,700
This is just flimsy meme-based nonsense that Alex is passing off as research, and it means

706
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,700
nothing.

707
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,700
Yeah.

708
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,700
Also, we have not yet to get to any calls.

709
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,020
Yeah, it's one of those, you know, it's one of those things where it's like, you guys

710
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,340
can't know about science for now.

711
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,700
You're just not ready to know a little bit about science.

712
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,700
You're going to hurt yourselves.

713
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,900
Yeah, a little bit is worse than none.

714
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

715
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,220
You guys just got to hold off on science.

716
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,220
We'll get to you.

717
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,220
You're going to learn it someday, I promise, but for now-

718
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,740
Yeah, just say it's like devil magic in the syringe.

719
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,740
Yes, please.

720
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,820
Please just, yeah, yeah.

721
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,820
This is no good.

722
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,820
Yeah.

723
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:29,220
So, he's going to open the phones next segment, but he has some questions.

724
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,740
These are leading questions.

725
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,740
Okay.

726
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:38,520
Well, I want to open the phones up next segment, and I want to ask all the listeners and all

727
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:49,300
of the viewers at 877-789-2539 and all the radio listeners at 877-789-2539 or 877-789-Alex,

728
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,540
I want to ask you, are you planning to take the vaccine?

729
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,460
If you're not, what are you going to do when they try to pressure you and push it on you

730
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,540
or try to say it's mandatory as we're doing in some foreign countries and now pushing

731
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,540
here?

732
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:05,340
And then what do you make of the vaccine makers having liability protection so that when and

733
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:10,620
if they hurt you, they don't get in any trouble?

734
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,780
I love the idea that his first question is, are you going to take the vaccine?

735
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,820
Obviously the answer from everybody is, fuck no.

736
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

737
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,220
Second question, what are you going to do when they force you to like, oh, let's swim

738
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,900
around in violence fantasies about justified violence.

739
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,660
And then the third question is something that none of them are equipped to have, a conversation

740
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:32,980
about why companies have liability protection and what it means.

741
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,260
That's something that no one who's calling into his show or Alex himself is prepared

742
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,260
to have.

743
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:42,660
I mean, I suppose one more question would be like, how would it feel to be immune to

744
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,660
a disease?

745
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,660
Does that sound exciting?

746
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,660
Does anybody feel excited about that?

747
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,820
Is that a Stan Lee superpower?

748
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,620
Watch this, you can't be hurt by this disease.

749
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,660
And it's cause real stuff, not cause your mind palace or whatever it is.

750
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,660
It's cause of magic.

751
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,660
Yeah.

752
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:04,180
Um, Alex does not go to calls yet because he realizes that like, ah, David Knight's

753
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,180
not here.

754
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,180
Right.

755
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,180
I'm doing his job.

756
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,180
He's still got more shit talk to do.

757
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,180
Yeah.

758
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,300
If you tuned in, you're wondering where the David Knight show is.

759
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,500
David's done a great job for nine years here.

760
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,060
And uh, David deserves a break.

761
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,820
We really appreciate David Knight.

762
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:23,180
And so I made the decision to go ahead and for now cancel that show.

763
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,180
He wants to do it on his own.

764
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,180
That's wonderful.

765
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,740
Maybe someday he'll do something here where it's once a week or something.

766
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,180
Uh, I just think that, uh, I'm burnout and don't want this job.

767
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,860
It's very exhausting, but I have a mission and, and David, um, let's just say David doesn't

768
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,860
give a fuck front lines.

769
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,580
If I think that it's a bad thing, I'm gonna leave it at that.

770
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,180
Uh, but to David, you know, has, as a trooper, he's to take care of himself.

771
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,180
Yeah.

772
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,180
So David Knight's not committed.

773
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,500
Apparently he doesn't have a mission like Alex does.

774
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:55,100
I'm not going to keep a guy on the front lines if he's not, uh, let's leave it at

775
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,100
that.

776
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,100
Okay.

777
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
Wait.

778
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,900
So now it's because he's not performance related to the cause.

779
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:06,260
I mean, it must be, whether it's like a will or ability, he's not somebody you have on

780
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,260
the front line.

781
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,260
He's not on the team.

782
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,820
That's not just a, you being a nice guy.

783
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,940
He's not happy here.

784
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:17,060
No, that's a, that's a whole nother explanation and it turns out Alex, there might've been

785
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,060
other influences.

786
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,060
Sure.

787
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,060
And that's it.

788
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,060
There's no controversy.

789
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,140
There's no, there's no secret reason.

790
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,340
It's not because he was bashing Trump every day.

791
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,540
I'm very frustrated with Trump that has nothing to do with it.

792
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,900
It has to do with, I just thinking about it, praying about it, having dreams about David,

793
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,380
really been worried about him.

794
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,020
And I was worried about him last time he had that big heart attack and almost died.

795
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,780
So I just, it's just, I just, I just said, Hey, that's that.

796
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,100
So we pray for David.

797
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,100
He's a great guy.

798
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,220
He's doing great, but, uh, that's it.

799
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,220
All right.

800
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,480
We'll be right back.

801
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
So you had a dream.

802
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,040
Uh, I had a fuck dream about David Knight.

803
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
So he's gone.

804
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,980
I thought the last straw was Alex learning that black lives matter made $10 billion.

805
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:02,860
No, it turns out this time, uh, it is, uh, because if you bash Trump every day and now

806
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,960
it's not about that, I'm mad at Trump too.

807
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,020
But if you bash Trump every day, you're not committed to the cause and you're fired.

808
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,820
That's an explanation that he didn't give.

809
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,820
That's an explanation.

810
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,020
You just put it under the pachannic section because it's like what you would think based

811
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,020
on what he's saying.

812
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,020
Yeah.

813
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,720
But there's another explanation buried in there and I'm trying to save his life.

814
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,740
He's going to die if he keeps this up.

815
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,740
All right guys.

816
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,340
I thought he wasn't committed.

817
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,340
I don't know.

818
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,340
I don't know.

819
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,340
I don't know.

820
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,840
I hope he does his show by his self.

821
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,460
You would sue him.

822
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,760
You know you would sue him.

823
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760
There's a decent chance.

824
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,760
Yeah.

825
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,060
So, uh, Alex has something he's got to deal with, uh, before he gets to calls and that

826
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,980
is that, uh, Mike Pence got a shot.

827
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,980
Yeah.

828
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,980
Um, and Alex shouldn't.

829
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,540
Is he a cyborg or is he dead?

830
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:52,540
Well, I mean, he's an enemy according to, you know, recent Info Wars lore, but, uh,

831
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,180
still, still would be troubling if Mike Pence got this shot that Alex is saying is going

832
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,180
to kill everyone.

833
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,180
Okay.

834
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:02,700
This is footage of the vice president just 30 minutes ago or so right before he went

835
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:10,820
live on air, taking the supposed vaccine, and I got to tell you, they've caught world

836
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:16,340
leaders in Germany, Japan, other areas, claiming they're taking the shot and then not taking

837
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,340
it.

838
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,260
So he's just going to imply that it's a fake shot.

839
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,260
That works.

840
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,060
I mean, I honestly, I think it's reasonable to just go with.

841
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,260
They get the rich guy shot, right?

842
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,860
It's more you're looking for a theory and you can just make anything up, then why not

843
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,860
do that?

844
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,540
It's more reasonable to think that the wealthy are getting better and different care now

845
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,060
than it is to think they are taking the same shot.

846
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,060
I don't think that.

847
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:43,420
I think they're taking the same shot, but it's fucking reasonable to be like, Oh, they're

848
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,900
getting rich guy medicine while we get the medium kind.

849
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,540
And Alex has a tradition of talking about clean vaccine.

850
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,660
Yeah, exactly.

851
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,660
So why not?

852
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,660
Yeah.

853
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,660
I don't know.

854
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:59,700
And he's already said that the mRNA vaccine is better than the older type of vaccine.

855
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,700
No.

856
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,700
Or is it the inverse?

857
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,820
Alex has said, although he dropped this narrative really quick when he realized he didn't know

858
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,820
what he was talking about.

859
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,820
Yeah.

860
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:11,580
He said that Trump was putting out the Pfizer vaccine in order to cut Gates off at the pass.

861
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,580
Oh, that's right.

862
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,580
Because Alex didn't realize that the Pfizer vaccine was an mRNA vaccine.

863
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,580
Right, right, right, right.

864
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,780
And he was saying that Gates wanted to do this evil one.

865
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,500
So Trump was putting this out in order to put it in checkmate.

866
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:26,420
That's why I got it mixed up because they're both mRNA, but yeah, now I got it.

867
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,420
He's just dumb.

868
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,420
Yeah.

869
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,420
Yeah.

870
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,420
And that's why that narrative is no longer in play.

871
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,780
Alex realized, Oh, I should probably pretend I didn't say that.

872
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,780
Yes.

873
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,780
It would be smarter.

874
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,780
Yeah.

875
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,780
So Alex finally gets to calls.

876
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,220
It's probably about, I would say 20 minutes in given like a commercial breaks, maybe even

877
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,220
a little longer.

878
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,500
And man, it doesn't start great.

879
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,500
Washington journal, like Washington journal, but American journal, a lot of calls.

880
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,260
Lily in California, you're on the air on the COVID vaccine.

881
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,620
Where do you stand on this?

882
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,820
Oh, absolutely not.

883
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,980
It's the mark of the beast.

884
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,980
No way.

885
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,980
What a shock.

886
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,980
Sure.

887
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,980
What a shock.

888
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,980
Taking America's temperature.

889
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:10,060
Just all these calls are just going to sound like screech to me.

890
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,060
That's it.

891
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,060
A lot of them.

892
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,060
Yeah.

893
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,060
Yeah.

894
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,060
There's nothing, there's no substance.

895
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,060
Yeah.

896
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,500
There's also going to be a break in that screeching though, uh, for plugs.

897
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,500
Of course.

898
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,180
But there's a second thing I wanted to mention very quickly.

899
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:28,180
It's like, I want fellow listeners to know about the opportunity to support the info

900
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,460
wars, not only with products, but that there's a support us on tap.

901
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:37,340
It's hard to find it's that you make it very hard to do it.

902
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:43,820
Um, but like two weeks ago, I just spent $50 I've, I've purchased lots of, of your products.

903
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,180
Um, the water filter and, uh, and the various supplements.

904
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,380
But right now, especially given everything that you're doing, I just want to put the

905
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,380
money in your hand.

906
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,660
I don't know how much I would have to spend to get for you to have $50 of profit.

907
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,060
I, I, I'm blown away.

908
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,780
The first caller just plugging, giving him money.

909
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,780
Yep.

910
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,780
Yep.

911
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,780
Not, not, uh, not screening calls.

912
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,780
Of course.

913
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,780
It's amazing.

914
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,780
That is Alex.

915
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,660
I want to take a little bit of time out on your show and plug the people could just give

916
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,180
you money without, without pills.

917
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,180
Can't believe that.

918
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:20,340
Uh, very shortly after announcing that you have to fire David Knight because of money

919
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,180
reasons, people are calling in saying, uh, you know, and they're definitely not planted

920
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,180
at all.

921
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,180
That would be crazy.

922
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,280
So she goes, Lily, Lily leaves and then we get the second caller.

923
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
This is mountain Patriot.

924
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
Sure.

925
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,260
Let's go ahead and talk to mountain Patriot in Colorado.

926
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,260
Thank you for holding.

927
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,260
Screech.

928
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,260
How you doing Alex?

929
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,260
Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.

930
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,260
We're in such a critical time.

931
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,260
Brother.

932
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,260
How are you?

933
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,260
I love you, man.

934
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,460
I'm going to miss David Knight, but totally understood.

935
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,500
Uh, we are at war.

936
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:57,300
I want to make a quick plug that DNA force, what are we doing?

937
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,380
It gets really annoying, really fast possible.

938
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:05,300
It almost feels like it can't be, you know, it is, it is not necessarily planted calls

939
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,300
or not.

940
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,300
I do.

941
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:11,060
I do believe that there is a possibility of just people hearing this happen over and

942
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,060
over again.

943
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,820
You get trained that like, Oh, the way a call goes with Alex is you plug a product and then

944
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,820
then you talk.

945
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,820
Right.

946
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,820
Right.

947
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,820
Right.

948
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,820
Right.

949
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,820
Okay.

950
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,820
This feels a little bit like, I'm sure you haven't seen it, but there's a movie called

951
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,620
Phantom thread, uh, starring what's his name.

952
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,700
Who's really good at acting.

953
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:34,780
I've heard the name of that movie before and uh, uh, spoilers, uh, essentially he's, he's

954
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:40,380
like part of their sex life is she regularly poisons him and takes care of him.

955
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,180
That's kind of a weird thing that they do.

956
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,380
So he just likes getting poisoned.

957
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,380
Sure.

958
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:50,140
So I feel like what I'm hearing from all of these people is like, I love getting poisoned

959
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,540
by your products.

960
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,780
That's just what I do.

961
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,420
I want to send you $50.

962
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,460
I like to trick myself into thinking that your pills do something for me.

963
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:04,240
Yeah, you're taking care of me, but because of munch houses, I guess I'm forcing myself

964
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,240
to get sick.

965
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,140
And this conversation that we're having is actually really interesting because it actually

966
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,820
kind of touches on something that really scared me about mountain Patriot.

967
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,820
Okay.

968
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,980
I want to talk about something called the placebo effect that I haven't heard anyone

969
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,220
mentioned in nine months since this all broke out.

970
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,180
We've been inside for these medicines.

971
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:32,260
They have to do a double blind study that is they have to do a double blind study in

972
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:38,700
order to eliminate the placebo effect, which is your own natural innate ability to heal.

973
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,780
So let's calm it, perfect metaphor, calm it, how they want to take our power away.

974
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,780
Don't do that.

975
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,780
Terrifying.

976
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,540
The placebo effect is how we're magic.

977
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,540
Yeah.

978
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,540
Yeah.

979
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,640
This caller legitimately thinks the placebo effect is a term that's used to describe your

980
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,260
body's natural ability to heal itself.

981
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,320
Doctors only use double blind studies because they have to get rid of the possibility that

982
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,920
you're just going to psychically heal yourself when you think you're getting medicine, right?

983
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,940
First of all, the caller is talking about a single blind study.

984
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,300
That's when a participant doesn't know whether they're getting a medicine or the placebo.

985
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,300
A double blind study is when the people administering the trial also don't know which participants

986
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,580
are getting the real thing or the placebo.

987
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,020
This is to remove any possible bias that could come from the researchers expecting certain

988
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:23,360
outcomes and treating participants differently depending on which group they're in.

989
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:28,340
Double blind studies are more relevant for eliminating what's known as observer bias.

990
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:33,660
Placebo effect generally both help with it, but secondly, the placebo effect does not

991
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,440
describe actual healing.

992
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,300
It's a phenomenon in the brain.

993
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,260
For instance, if you're told that you're being given a pill to treat anxiety, but it's actually

994
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:46,340
a placebo, the fact that you think that you're being given a pill that treats anxiety can

995
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,340
have the effect of decreasing your anxiety.

996
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,340
Totally.

997
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,800
This is a very interesting and complicated thing, but it doesn't work like magic.

998
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,380
If you have an infection and you're given a placebo, it will not treat that infection.

999
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,380
No, I'm pretty sure it will.

1000
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:02,060
You may experience some pain relief or something like that, but you will still have that infection

1001
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,540
because the placebo is not treating the condition at all.

1002
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,540
No, no, no.

1003
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:11,580
If you break your leg and they give you a fake pill that heals legs, your leg will heal

1004
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,180
naturally if you believe in it.

1005
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,180
Sure.

1006
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,940
A good way to understand this difference is by looking at a 2011 study from Harvard Medical

1007
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,560
School and DeCote College and the University of Hull.

1008
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,700
Researchers there were looking to better understand the dynamics of placebo effect and symptom

1009
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:31,060
relief, so they designed a study where persons with asthma were given real and placebo inhalers

1010
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,180
as well as no treatment and also sham acupuncture.

1011
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,180
Gotcha.

1012
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,820
The study found that patients with placebo inhalers and even the fake acupuncturism...

1013
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,020
Wait, was it specifically sham acupuncture?

1014
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,020
Yeah, yeah.

1015
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,020
They didn't give...

1016
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,420
Real acupuncture might work?

1017
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,420
Just in case.

1018
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,420
It's just to eliminate another possible...

1019
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,420
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

1020
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,420
No, no, no.

1021
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,420
I gotcha.

1022
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,420
I gotcha.

1023
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,420
I'm sorry for interrupting it.

1024
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,420
Yeah.

1025
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,420
It seemed really...

1026
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,420
It is weird.

1027
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,420
Yeah.

1028
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,040
So the people with the placebo inhalers and even the fake acupuncture groups subjectively

1029
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,900
reported feeling better, and they felt like their symptoms were improving.

1030
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,620
However, both of these groups that got the false treatments showed no improvement in

1031
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,940
terms of actual lung function.

1032
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,980
The actual asthma was not affected at all by the fake treatments, but some of the symptoms

1033
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,060
of asthma could be alleviated.

1034
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,060
Sure.

1035
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,880
This was not true of the group that got the medicine, in this case albuterol.

1036
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,900
Those people actually did have greater lung function.

1037
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,680
It's great that through the experience of getting treatment, people can experience a

1038
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,040
beneficial result, but it should not be mistaken for actual treatment.

1039
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,260
If the people who got fake inhalers were then forced to perform a task that required lung

1040
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,880
exertion, they would be at a higher risk than the people who got the albuterol.

1041
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,580
This is the placebo effect that blind studies hope to minimize so they can test how effective

1042
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,500
an actual medication is, and what kind of side effects it could have independent of

1043
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,900
a person's expectations.

1044
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,700
There's another kind of placebo effect, which is basically Alex's business model.

1045
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,940
This is where you convince people they have a fake ailment, then you give them a placebo

1046
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,380
to cure it.

1047
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,440
His pills won't really do anything, but if he convinces you that your brain just won't

1048
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,180
work without his iodine, then you take his iodine and your brain works fine, you'll attribute

1049
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,340
that to his iodine.

1050
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,780
Iodine efficiency is a real condition, but pretty much everyone listening to Alex's show

1051
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,300
doesn't have it.

1052
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:17,180
But making you think that you might, eh, it's a super profitable thing when you sell iodine

1053
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,820
and you can manipulate that placebo effect.

1054
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:24,020
Yeah, I think the only thing that we can confirm his products to, or at least points heavily

1055
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,540
to his products to, is boners.

1056
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,980
And that might even be psychosomatic.

1057
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:33,140
Yeah, totally, but every time somebody talks about it, there's never like, I have more

1058
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,220
energy, or like, I feel more assertive.

1059
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,740
It's always like, my wife hates me now.

1060
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,980
You know, like it's never...

1061
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:44,880
Yeah, but if you're taking that, maybe you have some kind of a mental block that's inhibiting

1062
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,340
your ability to come around.

1063
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,740
Or it's just basically bull testosterone that you shove in your face.

1064
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,060
It's possible too, I don't know.

1065
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,900
But anyway, the fact that this caller who's plugging Alex's product doesn't understand

1066
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,680
the placebo effect, that is like, art.

1067
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,680
You can't have science.

1068
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,680
It's perfect.

1069
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,680
You can't get it.

1070
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,680
It's perfect though.

1071
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,680
It's so...

1072
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,680
Trax.

1073
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,680
Yeah.

1074
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,900
It's just, they're just not ready for it.

1075
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,540
They're just not, just like how like Galileo, admittedly he was a dick, but the people around

1076
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:16,740
him just weren't ready for science yet, and he kept trying to give it to him, and then

1077
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,740
he got trapped.

1078
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,420
I mean, again, that was mainly because he was a dick.

1079
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,300
But it happens, you know?

1080
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,460
Those people weren't ready for science.

1081
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,460
They weren't ready for science.

1082
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,880
These people aren't ready for science.

1083
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,380
You know what Alex isn't ready to do?

1084
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,380
Take calls?

1085
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,380
Stop talking about David Knight.

1086
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,380
Okay.

1087
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,580
I've had the idea for this show for many, many years, never done it.

1088
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:39,940
I decided to do this at about two o'clock yesterday.

1089
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,660
I made the decision to go ahead and just launch this show immediately.

1090
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,920
Bad idea.

1091
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,920
Really regretting that.

1092
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
We're all stressed out.

1093
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,920
There's so much going on.

1094
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,920
There's so much happening.

1095
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,380
We could have just taken the day off.

1096
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:56,020
I would watch David Knight, who's just a great guy, get ready for four hours in the morning

1097
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:01,900
before he went on at 8 a.m., and then I would sometimes get off my show at like two o'clock,

1098
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:08,580
and he would be in the studio researching, looking like he was in living hell, and I

1099
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,140
was like, dude, you've got to not work 16 hours a day.

1100
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,500
I mean, stacks of notes, computers out, just insane.

1101
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,460
Isn't that what you say you do, Alex?

1102
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,460
Unreal.

1103
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,780
So now he said he's firing David because he works too hard.

1104
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,780
He works too hard.

1105
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,220
He works too hard.

1106
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,100
The man is too committed to the info war.

1107
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,140
That's why I had to fire him.

1108
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,500
I've never seen him in flip flops.

1109
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,220
He's too serious.

1110
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:37,620
So we have both, he's not committed, and he doesn't care enough, and that's why he can't

1111
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,860
be on the front lines, and also, he works too hard.

1112
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,180
He researches all the time.

1113
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,180
He's just too committed.

1114
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:46,580
He's here at four in the morning, grinding.

1115
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,760
He's not committed to the info war, Dan.

1116
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,380
He's treating this as if it's some kind of job.

1117
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,380
None of this makes sense.

1118
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:59,020
It's a little bit internally inconsistent, but it is fun to just hear him go all over

1119
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,020
the place.

1120
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:04,740
But look, whatever the actual reason behind it, David needed a break, and Alex knows that

1121
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,500
because he needs a break.

1122
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,460
Alex needs a break.

1123
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,220
But I just wanted to have a clean break.

1124
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:15,980
It hit me yesterday morning, watched him on the show and worried about him.

1125
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,140
And so that's what this is.

1126
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:21,580
And it's also a financial issue.

1127
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,740
David doesn't get paid that much, whatever, does a great job.

1128
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:28,780
It's just that we don't have enough crew to run all these shows, and they're burnt out.

1129
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:33,920
And with COVID, a few people's wives or whatever were in a place that had it, so they had to

1130
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,140
leave and take care of them.

1131
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:42,700
And it's just been like we're a NASCAR that has been in two or three races, but hasn't

1132
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,140
even had the engine looked at.

1133
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,180
And now there's fire coming out of the engine.

1134
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,940
So I'm taking off all next week, and I never take off a full week.

1135
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,200
I always work wherever I'm at.

1136
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,820
I'm going to literally hide my phone and turn the computers off.

1137
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:01,500
And I told my wife last night, I said, we're going to put your phone up, and we're going

1138
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,080
to spend time with the family, and I'm going to disconnect and come back five years younger.

1139
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,300
I believe he probably is going to take the week off, but it's also Christmas.

1140
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,300
Wow.

1141
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:14,860
I mean, he deserves a break, so he's going to do something out of this world and take

1142
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,380
the week of Christmas off.

1143
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,340
Some people would never dream of doing that.

1144
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,820
I'm going to take him at his word.

1145
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,860
They're called everybody who doesn't care.

1146
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,240
I'm going to take him at his word and believe that he is actually going to take the week

1147
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,860
off, and we'll see if he does or not.

1148
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:27,860
That'd be nice.

1149
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,900
He's talking about what's going to happen on the shows, and he's like, Owen Schreier

1150
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,620
is going to host this morning's show and my show.

1151
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,060
And they're like, wait, his show's on right after your show.

1152
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1153
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,060
Put Owen Schreier to it.

1154
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,060
Put him through the gauntlet.

1155
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,060
Hell yeah.

1156
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,380
Harrison Smith's going to host the war room.

1157
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,020
No, I want Owen to go through the crucible.

1158
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:49,740
We have to be on air from eight to four, eight to five every day.

1159
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,540
How else are you going to get your chaps, man?

1160
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,540
I used to go out and do four or five sets in a night.

1161
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:59,820
You got to get your chaps going, so you might as well work 12 hour days.

1162
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:09,340
Anchoring a absurd call-in show, then sensational thing, then conspiracy bro down.

1163
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,340
Yeah, yeah.

1164
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,340
Three different vibes.

1165
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,340
Yeah.

1166
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,340
Yeah, it's not going to work.

1167
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,340
Yeah, no, it's not going to work.

1168
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,980
So Alex gets to another caller who has an interesting question.

1169
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,860
Everything that you said about needing your essential vitamins and minerals, that should

1170
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,860
be enough.

1171
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,580
Nobody needs these vaccines on top of everything else that's wrong with them.

1172
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:32,880
But my daughter is a mortician in Arizona and she's busy.

1173
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,880
She won't listen.

1174
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,640
She used to be open-minded and I don't know how to get through to her.

1175
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,340
And I just want to know if you have any suggestions.

1176
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:42,260
Well, I mean, I'm sure you've seen the band segment, a band out video with all the nurses

1177
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,420
and doctors, hundreds of videos saying it's an overblown fraud.

1178
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,520
We've got all these top scientists saying the John Hopkins report that came out said

1179
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,160
there's been as many deaths this year as there was this time last year of other things show

1180
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,780
if the overall death rate's not up, that means they're moving other deaths of flu and pneumonia

1181
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:04,100
and other things into the COVID column, which we know they're doing.

1182
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,860
Can't imagine why this lady's mortician daughter isn't listening to her.

1183
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:14,940
I don't know why my daughter is working also 12 hour days and she just doesn't believe

1184
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:15,940
me.

1185
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,160
Well, she looks sadder than David Knight.

1186
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,940
She looks real sad.

1187
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,080
Something's really weighing on her, you know.

1188
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,940
Johns' narrative here is a load of shit, and if he did one tenth of the research he pretends

1189
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,380
to, he would know that.

1190
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,560
So here's what happened with that Johns Hopkins thing that he's talking about.

1191
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:35,200
On November 13th, an economics lecturer at Johns Hopkins used faulty data to assert that

1192
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,940
there was no evidence of excess deaths in the United States this year.

1193
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,360
The numbers and analysis this lecturer were using were elementary and didn't take into

1194
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:46,760
account a bunch of relevant variables, whereas peer reviewed studies that follow higher standards

1195
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,340
have regularly shown an approximately 20% increase in mortality this year over long

1196
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,020
term averages.

1197
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:57,280
This wasn't a study or a report, it was a misrepresentation of data that was delivered

1198
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,760
in a lecture.

1199
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:04,420
This claim was then covered in the Johns Hopkins student newspaper, the Johns Hopkins newsletter.

1200
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:09,140
Naturally, as soon as people noticed, the paper retracted the story and issued a correction.

1201
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:13,040
In the meantime, however, the Gateway Pundit had found the article and began reporting

1202
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,460
on the erroneous claim made by the econ lecturer.

1203
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:20,000
The right-wing conspiracy narrative is that the lecturer is correct and that the retraction

1204
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,840
is a cover-up of this obviously accurate information, but that's a bunch of nonsense.

1205
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,360
Even the Gateway Pundit's framing of the story is intentionally misleading.

1206
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,760
Their headline was, quote, Johns Hopkins study mysteriously disappears after it revealed

1207
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,080
in spite of COVID no more deaths in 2020 than in prior years.

1208
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:42,420
There was no study to disappear, it was just a fabricated and sensationalized headline.

1209
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:46,180
You can follow the thread from right-wing bullshit website reporting on blog posts from

1210
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:49,900
another right-wing bullshit website all the way back to the student newspaper article

1211
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,320
that has been retracted.

1212
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:56,580
Even in that article, they say that the lecturer, quote, also mentioned that more research and

1213
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:01,820
data are needed to truly decipher the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the United States.

1214
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:05,700
So basically you have an economics lecturer who gave a talk where she inaccurately interpreted

1215
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:10,020
some data, which was then covered by a student newspaper, which was then inaccurately reported

1216
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,760
on by dumb right-wing blogs.

1217
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,160
The student article was retracted, which the right-wing blogs then made part of the conspiracy.

1218
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,160
Of course.

1219
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,260
This is then reported on by Alex as Johns Hopkins proving in a study that there's no

1220
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:26,220
excess deaths in 2020 and that COVID deaths are all a hoax or just other deaths shuffled

1221
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:30,160
over, which is what this caller should then tell her mortician daughter to help open her

1222
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,100
mind about vaccine denialism.

1223
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,700
Oh boy.

1224
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,700
American Journal.

1225
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,420
I do not want to denigrate student newspapers at all.

1226
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:45,300
During the protests in Chicago, student newspapers did a million times better job than any other

1227
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:50,140
local media, and especially better than the national media in Chicago.

1228
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,140
There's a double-edged sword to student.

1229
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:55,220
But at the same time, it's still a student newspaper.

1230
00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:01,660
We can't be, the right-wing can't be like, ah, student newspaper did something, so yeah.

1231
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:08,580
It's sort of a, it's hard to make like a full statement on, because it's like, okay, yeah,

1232
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:13,260
some student journalists are amazingly capable and can do good work.

1233
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,260
Totally.

1234
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:18,660
You know, some mistakes that wouldn't happen in professional newsrooms can happen at student

1235
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,220
newspapers because they're student newspapers.

1236
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,220
Exactly.

1237
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,860
It's, you know, the knife cuts both ways.

1238
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,860
Totally.

1239
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:26,860
It's tough.

1240
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:27,860
Totally.

1241
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:28,860
So we got another caller.

1242
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:29,860
Yeah.

1243
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,220
Let's take a few calls here before we go to break, and I'll come back and take nothing

1244
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,660
but calls, but I wanted to hit those stories.

1245
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:41,100
Holding the longest would be Kurt in Oklahoma, Kurt, welcome.

1246
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:48,340
There is nothing better, nothing more comfy than waking up, saying a prayer, brewing a

1247
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:55,380
cup of Wake Up America Patriot Blend, and calling in to the American Journal.

1248
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,380
That's right, sir.

1249
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,060
Well, we're honored to be here, and we're glad to be taking your calls.

1250
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,540
What is your view on this situation with the vaccines?

1251
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,820
So this guy's plugging Alex's coffee.

1252
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,820
Yeah.

1253
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,340
It's just, it's getting annoying at this point.

1254
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,340
It's very frustrating.

1255
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:11,060
Oh, there's nothing more relaxing than drinking your coffee and calling in to the first episode.

1256
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,060
Yeah.

1257
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,060
Of your show.

1258
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:18,060
Is that some sort of, like, among Info Wars, like, diehard listeners, is that some sort

1259
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,700
of meme, like a way they communicate with each other?

1260
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,700
That's interesting.

1261
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:25,420
Okay, if you plug, you know, like, we're all so used to Alex plugging.

1262
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,420
Yeah.

1263
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,660
Like, is that part of, like, a memetic language that they have with each other?

1264
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:34,580
It's possible, and I also think that a lot of times Alex's ads end up using callers in

1265
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,580
them.

1266
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,580
Right.

1267
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,580
Because there is that, like, frack, I need your help, frack.

1268
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:38,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1269
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,580
That you would play.

1270
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,580
So maybe they're hoping...

1271
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,900
Yeah, that could be.

1272
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,700
They're hoping that they'll become a commercial that Alex uses.

1273
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,700
Right, right, right.

1274
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,700
I don't know, that's possible.

1275
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,700
That would be interesting.

1276
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:51,500
I mean, I know that when I was, like, 13, 14, I would call and request a song on the

1277
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,260
radio, like, call the DJs.

1278
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,700
I was hoping that they would record it and use it to introduce the song.

1279
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,700
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

1280
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,900
Maybe that's the same thing, but they're adults.

1281
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,900
Yeah.

1282
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,780
They're trying to help Alex sell pills.

1283
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:08,780
Yeah, that's a little bit less, it's lower on the totem pole than Rick asking for a song.

1284
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:09,780
Yeah.

1285
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,780
Exactly.

1286
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,780
That caller, just in case you were worried about this.

1287
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,780
Not into the vaccine.

1288
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,780
In case you're curious.

1289
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:22,020
Something that Alex isn't into is stop talking about David Knight.

1290
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,140
And I intend to host this some, I intend to get other hosts that are going to rotate through

1291
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,140
maybe David Knight if you want, sometimes.

1292
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,140
I'll come in and do it.

1293
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:31,380
I'm going to show a TV viewer something that was just regularly a David Knight slot for

1294
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:37,280
the last four years, and I just abruptly decided yesterday to end that show because it was

1295
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,580
just my gut level thing to do, the right thing to do for David, for him, for us, for the

1296
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:47,300
country, for the world, because the country that he's been worn out and exhausted by this,

1297
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,300
just like I am.

1298
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,060
And my gut, my spirit told me to do it.

1299
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,060
Here's an example.

1300
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,060
Here's a promo.

1301
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:57,500
We started putting out last week, send out to all these TV stations and around the country

1302
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,500
saying if you haven't picked up the David Knight show top thing here, please pick up

1303
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,500
the David Knight show.

1304
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:07,260
Then Alex Jones, then the war room, this has been sent out starting last week to every

1305
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,100
one explaining that we're on galaxy 16 video satellite, AMC 18 radio satellite.

1306
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,100
I love David.

1307
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:18,000
He's been here nine years, really smart guy, but the election and some of our political

1308
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,800
disagreements were making him super upset.

1309
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,800
Not me.

1310
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,800
Oh, okay.

1311
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,800
Okay.

1312
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,460
So now he's pissed off.

1313
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,460
Not okay.

1314
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,460
First.

1315
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:31,280
So now David is uncomfortable about political disagreements with Alex, but Alex, totally

1316
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,280
cool.

1317
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,280
Above it.

1318
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,280
Totally cool.

1319
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,280
He's chill.

1320
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,280
He's chill as hell.

1321
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,260
And also the whole thing about the promotional materials being sent out last week.

1322
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,500
It sounds like nobody picked up David Knight's show.

1323
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,160
So they canned him.

1324
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,160
That's possible.

1325
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,620
But Alex is trying to use that as evidence that like, I don't know.

1326
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,940
We've got more support behind David Knight's show.

1327
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:52,940
Yeah.

1328
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:53,940
Yeah.

1329
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,740
All that proves is like maybe it was a snap decision.

1330
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,740
Yeah.

1331
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,740
That's all.

1332
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,740
Yeah.

1333
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,740
Nobody picked up his show.

1334
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:01,740
Yeah.

1335
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:05,260
I think if you've been racking your brain and so worried about how much work he puts

1336
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:09,980
in, the fact that you had promotional materials that came out last week doesn't help your

1337
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:10,980
case.

1338
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:18,140
I feel like everybody's so attuned to the vagaries of the TV show business now that

1339
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,700
there's a part of the...

1340
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,540
Why not just say that we didn't pick up his show again?

1341
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,540
Right.

1342
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,540
Like it's not hard.

1343
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,540
Right.

1344
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,620
It could be so easy and everybody'd be like, oh, there's a reason, but they just didn't

1345
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,620
pick up the show.

1346
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,620
Hey, Alex.

1347
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,620
Shut up.

1348
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:34,380
Heroes didn't get a third season and everybody's like, well, yeah, they didn't pick up the

1349
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:35,460
show.

1350
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,820
It's...

1351
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,140
Or did it get a third season?

1352
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,140
I know they had a comeback.

1353
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,140
Ooh, that's not good.

1354
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,140
It was bad.

1355
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,140
It wasn't good.

1356
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,140
That's not good.

1357
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:47,340
Look, dude, there are a hundred ways you could do this and none of it requires any of this

1358
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,340
shit.

1359
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,340
None of this shit!

1360
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,340
No.

1361
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:54,700
We've got 16 reasons, some of which are I'm a hero and the others are David Knight's disagreeing

1362
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,540
with me and the others are insane.

1363
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,540
Mm-hmm.

1364
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,540
Oh, boy.

1365
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:03,700
But we do have one explanation for his termination that we get crossed off the list here.

1366
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,700
Why?

1367
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,460
One thing that definitely had nothing to do with it.

1368
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,900
He does have both feet.

1369
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,380
And during the break, they're like, yeah, people think you got rid of David because

1370
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,380
of Steve Pacinek.

1371
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:17,380
Steve Pacinek didn't even enter my mind and those two fighting with each other.

1372
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,380
So it was him.

1373
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:21,380
Zero, zero, zero to do with it.

1374
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:28,940
It had to do with David was very ashen, very white, looked really sick to him.

1375
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:29,940
Wow.

1376
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:33,740
And I thought about telling him quit at that point because he looked so depressed.

1377
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:34,740
Okay.

1378
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:35,740
And I almost did it then.

1379
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:39,600
And he had a massive heart attack and almost died and he's been looking the same.

1380
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,600
And that's it.

1381
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,060
And it's not a personal issue.

1382
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,060
It's none of that.

1383
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,060
I care about David.

1384
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,060
He needs a break.

1385
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,060
He just needs a break.

1386
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,060
Oh, man.

1387
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,220
Listen, it's not Steve.

1388
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:54,060
Now there's nothing that makes me know it's Steve more than him being like, I never thought

1389
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,060
about it.

1390
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,220
Zero possibility, zero possibility of that.

1391
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:01,360
It makes me more suspicious of that for sure.

1392
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:06,780
And this is one of those instances where it's not just you and I have been saying that.

1393
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,660
Sometimes Alex will say like, oh, people will say I kill dogs a lot.

1394
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,660
We say that.

1395
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,660
That's us.

1396
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,660
Yeah.

1397
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:16,020
This is something that a lot of people on Twitter have been pointing out because David

1398
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:19,980
was tweeting on about how Steve sucks.

1399
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:23,940
So it is a little bit more of a public thing, but look, dude, he just worked too hard.

1400
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,940
That's all it is.

1401
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,940
He was ashen.

1402
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,160
I care about David.

1403
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,160
He needs a break.

1404
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,940
I mean, again, four hours before the show getting ready.

1405
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:35,720
Three hours of a show, three, four hours after studying, looking like he's in hell.

1406
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,920
And so I fired him.

1407
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,920
God told me to do it.

1408
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,340
It was like 10 a.m. over there.

1409
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,340
God told me.

1410
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,340
Okay.

1411
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:44,340
I've got to go let David go.

1412
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,680
It's just got to do it clean and be done.

1413
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,460
And then later at the show, they go, what are you going to do?

1414
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,700
And I said, I guess we'll cancel the show.

1415
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,780
And they go, a lot of stations picked that up.

1416
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:52,780
I said, I'm too exhausted.

1417
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,780
I'm taking off next week.

1418
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,780
I might quit.

1419
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:55,780
This is a real conversation.

1420
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:56,780
They said, you can't quit.

1421
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,740
They said, I know I just can't focus on the evil anymore.

1422
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,100
I know how David feels.

1423
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,320
And then you feel like you're not doing enough.

1424
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,340
And then I and then your brain runs out of dopamine.

1425
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,100
And then I'm super exhausted.

1426
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,740
And I don't even have time with my children.

1427
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:12,420
They said, just take off next week and think about what you're going to do.

1428
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:16,260
But I had to make that decision because I didn't make the decision when my gut told

1429
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:19,180
me to do it the last time he almost died.

1430
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,180
Okay.

1431
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,420
So I told God this.

1432
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,500
I've told you this.

1433
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,700
I'm going my gut now, period, because it's never been wrong.

1434
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,940
And I haven't been following my whole life.

1435
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,860
And the more I follow my gut, the more I never make mistakes.

1436
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,740
So I'm not going to put into all the reasons of why it happened.

1437
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,300
It has zero to do with Steve Puccini.

1438
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,300
Okay.

1439
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,300
So it was Steve Puccini.

1440
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,100
That pissed me off during the break when they were like, uh, yeah, they think it's so I'm

1441
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,660
not involved in this Twitter beef.

1442
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,660
Yeah, man.

1443
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,020
This, this playground nonsense on Twitter.

1444
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:51,200
So Steve Puccini, I will, I will put that down.

1445
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,500
The lady doth protest too much.

1446
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,500
No kidding.

1447
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,900
Come on, man.

1448
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,620
I'm pissed off that people saw through the bullshit.

1449
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,280
We did pick up his show.

1450
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,980
That's all you have to say.

1451
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,780
Or it could just be like, it's personal.

1452
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:04,780
Yeah.

1453
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,780
Yeah.

1454
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:09,140
You know how many people have left Info Wars in the past?

1455
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,140
Yeah.

1456
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,620
How few of them anyone care has gone now.

1457
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:13,620
Yeah.

1458
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:14,620
I couldn't, I can't imagine.

1459
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:18,060
I mean, I guess there's some like old timers who probably like, Hey, where's Jakari?

1460
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,060
Where's Leanne McAdoo?

1461
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,100
But like, no one cares now.

1462
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,100
Joe Biggs is gone.

1463
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,620
No one gives a shit.

1464
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:28,220
David and I had a creative disagreements and so I let him go.

1465
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:31,060
I honestly think that the financial thing is probably your best play.

1466
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,700
If he could have just stuck to that.

1467
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:33,700
We're broke.

1468
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:34,700
Yeah.

1469
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:35,700
Yeah.

1470
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:38,740
Because that elicits support from the audience who want to see your thing not disappear.

1471
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:43,660
It doesn't require you to get into the mud with David about how he works too hard, which

1472
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,660
is confusing.

1473
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,660
Wild.

1474
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,980
Cause he's also not committed at all to the Info War.

1475
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:48,980
Right.

1476
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:52,020
And his workload seems to be less than you pretend you have for yourself.

1477
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,020
Exactly.

1478
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,340
It's all just too complicated.

1479
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:59,100
Just say like we had a really good salary for him and we couldn't carry it into the

1480
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,180
next quarter or whatever.

1481
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,700
There's like, that would be adult, right?

1482
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:09,540
But because it is definitely personal, he just can't stick to the story.

1483
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,460
It almost certainly has to be.

1484
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,620
It is personal.

1485
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:14,540
And so we can't stick to the fucking story.

1486
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,660
There's a mystery here.

1487
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:20,860
And I think what I might need to do on Alex's week off, this is going to be painful as hell.

1488
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:24,620
I might have to go through the last shows that David Knight did and see if there's some

1489
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,620
kind of a clue.

1490
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,620
No.

1491
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:27,620
I don't know.

1492
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,620
Maybe there will be.

1493
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:29,620
I don't know.

1494
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,020
That would be a terrible Christmas episode for us to put out.

1495
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:37,180
I just hope that Alex Jones fires me for the next thing I'm about to say.

1496
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:40,420
I am working too hard.

1497
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:43,380
So Alex gets off this topic for a moment.

1498
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:47,300
Anybody notice my ashen face lately?

1499
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:55,380
So leaving aside Alex's anger and confusion about what exactly happened, he has some optimism.

1500
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:59,660
Now I've told you, Trump has a real shot at staying in office and defeating this election

1501
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:00,660
fraud.

1502
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:04,960
If he gets bold and if he comes out against the globalist and points out that Biden's

1503
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,300
a communist Chinese agent, and if he puts all his people in from the Pentagon at key

1504
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:14,220
positions and sells the American people on a limited form of martial law that General

1505
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:16,380
Flynn and others have rightfully called for.

1506
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,380
When do you call martial law?

1507
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:22,560
When there is a foreign power that has occupied you.

1508
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,040
That is what the definition says.

1509
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:28,100
That's the reasons for martial law under US military history.

1510
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,100
Wow.

1511
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:33,060
So declared 60 something times in US history, it's usually for insurrections or things like

1512
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,060
that.

1513
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,060
This is a ChaiCom takeover.

1514
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:36,060
We are infiltrated.

1515
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,460
Joe Biden does work for China.

1516
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:38,460
Sure.

1517
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,580
India did lie and say he was the president.

1518
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:41,260
They did steal these key areas.

1519
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:42,660
We have all the evidence.

1520
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:44,620
We bare minimum need a new election.

1521
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:45,620
Wow.

1522
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:50,540
The 64 thing or 60 something odd times martial law has been declared is it's something Alex

1523
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,740
is just repeating from an interview you heard with Mike Flynn.

1524
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1525
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,220
So I want to tell you a little trivia.

1526
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:56,220
Sure.

1527
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:59,080
How many times do you think martial law has been declared since World War II?

1528
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,860
Since World War II, uh, twice.

1529
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:02,860
Nine.

1530
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:03,860
Nine.

1531
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,860
Nine times.

1532
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:05,860
Nine times.

1533
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:06,860
Okay.

1534
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:07,860
And you know what?

1535
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:08,860
Five of them.

1536
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:09,860
I found this in an article from 1989.

1537
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:10,860
Sure.

1538
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:11,860
In the Law and Order Journal.

1539
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:12,860
Oh, since World War II.

1540
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:15,700
Five of them, I would almost guarantee are during the civil rights era.

1541
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,700
Yes, there we go.

1542
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,700
Yeah.

1543
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:23,020
Quote, in five instances, it was designed to counter resistance to federal desegregation

1544
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:24,020
decrees in the south.

1545
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,020
There we go.

1546
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:30,060
Over half the times any kind of martial law has been used, it's because of people like

1547
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:34,620
Alex who think that desegregation is a communist plot.

1548
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:35,620
Yeah.

1549
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:36,620
Yes.

1550
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:37,620
It's, it's, it's you.

1551
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:38,620
Yeah.

1552
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:39,620
Uh.

1553
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:40,620
I was, you know what?

1554
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:47,220
I, I, I, uh, if Trump overthrows the government, does he still get to keep the POTUS Twitter

1555
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:48,220
account?

1556
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:49,940
You know, cause they're going to transfer it over to Biden.

1557
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:50,940
Jack.

1558
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:51,940
When Biden becomes president.

1559
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:59,540
Do we have, do we have DOTUS dictator, somebody grab up all the dictators, get all the dictator

1560
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:01,540
related Twitter accounts.

1561
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:04,440
Um, Kim Jong Trump.

1562
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,440
That would be a good one.

1563
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,740
At Kim Jong Trump.

1564
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:07,740
I don't know, man.

1565
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:11,180
I think that Jack would have a really tough decision to make at that point.

1566
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,180
Yeah.

1567
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:15,300
Whether he wants to die or give Trump the Twitter handle.

1568
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,300
I don't know.

1569
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:17,300
We'll see.

1570
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:20,460
Billionaires generally are willing to die for causes.

1571
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:24,020
So Alex is at bare minimum new election.

1572
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,020
Right.

1573
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:26,020
Bare minimum.

1574
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:27,020
Yeah.

1575
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:28,820
Which everybody in the United States will accept.

1576
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:29,820
Yeah.

1577
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:32,580
That'll be something that we are all like, you know what, we got to get to the bottom

1578
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:33,580
of it this time.

1579
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:34,580
Yeah.

1580
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:35,580
Bare minimum new election.

1581
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,580
Now back to calls.

1582
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:37,580
Sure.

1583
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:38,580
Yeah.

1584
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:39,580
Let's talk to Baldy.

1585
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,580
Let's talk to Baldy in Florida.

1586
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,580
Baldy.

1587
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:42,580
You were down there at the bottom and I missed you.

1588
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:43,580
Sorry.

1589
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,580
Go ahead.

1590
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:45,580
Sure.

1591
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:47,940
Just as a reminder, I'm the one that all through March was calling, begging and pleading with

1592
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:52,100
everyone to realize that this was the April fool's virus.

1593
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:53,100
Real quick.

1594
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,340
I do not remember Baldy from that period.

1595
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:55,780
I'm not worried about it.

1596
01:04:55,780 --> 01:05:01,340
Now before I give my Baldy briefing on the pending inoculations, is that a regular segment?

1597
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:07,980
For generations to come, I wanted to spread the truth that it's President Trump that won

1598
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:08,980
the election.

1599
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:09,980
Hey, brother, do me a favor.

1600
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:10,980
You got me on speakerphone?

1601
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:11,980
No, sir.

1602
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:12,980
No, I missed you asking.

1603
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:13,980
Somebody missed his email.

1604
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:14,980
Speakerphone.

1605
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:15,980
Is this better?

1606
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:16,980
Say it again?

1607
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:17,980
Uh-huh.

1608
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,980
Is this better?

1609
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:19,980
Just hang up.

1610
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:20,980
Just talk quietly.

1611
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:21,980
I got to put him in my home.

1612
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:22,980
I can't handle it.

1613
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:23,980
Oh, boy.

1614
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:24,980
Don't do a call at the show, man.

1615
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:25,980
You knew this was going to happen.

1616
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:34,060
God, everyone knew this was going to happen.

1617
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:37,420
I'm shocked it doesn't happen more frequently during this episode.

1618
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:38,420
Oh, man.

1619
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:42,060
There are some tech issues, but this is the worst of it probably.

1620
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:44,260
But Alex gets pretty pissed off.

1621
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:45,760
I do not appreciate.

1622
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:52,900
If he does not have some sort of performative show or something, if he's just saying this

1623
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:56,260
is a baldy briefing to people in regular life.

1624
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:57,260
Get the fuck out of here.

1625
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,260
No, no, I love it.

1626
01:05:58,260 --> 01:05:59,260
No friends.

1627
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,260
Zero friends.

1628
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:01,260
I want to hang out with Baldy.

1629
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,260
No.

1630
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,260
No, thank you.

1631
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,260
I want to be briefed.

1632
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,260
Here's a baldy briefing for you.

1633
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,260
Goodbye, sir.

1634
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:07,260
Thank you.

1635
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:09,220
I got a baldy briefing for you.

1636
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,220
It's your turn to buy a round.

1637
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:13,060
If that's what he calls sex, I'm out.

1638
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:16,340
So we get another caller, and this was interesting.

1639
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:25,680
He wants to know about Steve's election sting stuff, because there is an interesting thing

1640
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:32,720
that like now, Alex, you need to make a statement on this, because it's obviously not true.

1641
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:39,140
So you need to put a flag down somewhere of, is Steve lying to you or is he wrong?

1642
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:40,540
That kind of thing.

1643
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:43,420
And of course this leads into more shitting on David's eyes.

1644
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:44,420
Yes, of course.

1645
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:50,660
And Steve Fuchenich, he did say with certainty that he had that whole sting operation with

1646
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,660
the blockchain and all that.

1647
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:53,660
None of that's been verified.

1648
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:56,260
I mean, what's your comment on that?

1649
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:59,820
From everyone's point of view, it kind of looks like he was a BS-er.

1650
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:01,940
Well, we're sure going to find out.

1651
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:03,180
I mean, I'm not wedded to Steve Fuchenich.

1652
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:08,300
He's been a guest on the show probably 50, 60, 70 times over the years, maybe more, maybe

1653
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,300
a hundred times.

1654
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,300
He went on Owen's show.

1655
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,620
I had no idea that was going to happen.

1656
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:15,860
I had him on about some other issues, and that's one of the things that pushed David

1657
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:16,860
over the edge.

1658
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:20,260
I mean, I'll just tell people, he started saying he's going to quit to everybody here.

1659
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:21,260
He said, I'm quitting.

1660
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:22,260
Alex is having Steve Fuchenich on.

1661
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:25,860
He went in and told, you know, Rob Duke, and he said, shouldn't have him on.

1662
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,660
Like Alex doesn't tell you to have one.

1663
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,920
So I don't tell David who to have on.

1664
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,960
He shouldn't tell me who to have on, but that had nothing to do with the fact that David

1665
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,460
was saying he wanted to quit.

1666
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:38,740
He was miserable and he wouldn't quit.

1667
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:40,580
So I just said, fly my friend.

1668
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:41,580
The door is open.

1669
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:47,220
So now, apparently, David wanted out, so I kicked him out the door.

1670
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,220
Yeah.

1671
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:53,100
David didn't want me to have Steve Fuchenich on anymore, which had nothing to do with anything.

1672
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:54,260
And he was going to quit.

1673
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:56,020
So I just said, get to walking.

1674
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:57,020
Get to walking.

1675
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:02,260
Now also I am pointing out that he told me not to have Steve on my show, which I said

1676
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,980
is a courtesy to a friend.

1677
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:04,980
Yeah.

1678
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,980
Talk to that guy.

1679
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:06,980
He's a menace.

1680
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:07,980
He's ruined your life.

1681
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:08,980
All right.

1682
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:09,980
Okay.

1683
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:12,400
So now we're getting closer to the real answer.

1684
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:17,740
Now Alex starts to get a little bit mad about David Knight giving him editorial advice.

1685
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:18,740
Sure.

1686
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:19,740
There we go.

1687
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:20,740
Yeah.

1688
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:21,740
The Steve Fuchenich thing pushed him over the edge.

1689
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,100
He basically told the whole crew he was going to quit.

1690
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,520
Well, he didn't do it.

1691
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,580
And he said he was going to quit years ago.

1692
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,820
So I finally said, look, dude, you don't want to be here.

1693
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:29,820
You're free.

1694
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:32,580
And I like David, but I'm not going to sit there and he's not doing this.

1695
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:33,580
He's a standup guy.

1696
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:37,380
You can leave a million dollars with that guy in 10 years, come back and every dollar

1697
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,380
would be there.

1698
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:41,100
He's a great, true, good guy.

1699
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,100
So I fired him.

1700
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,100
Engineer.

1701
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,100
Yeah.

1702
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:47,660
But like a lot of those guys, like a lot of those guys, it's his way or the highway.

1703
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:49,160
So okay.

1704
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,060
It's never me telling David what to have on.

1705
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,060
It's the other way around.

1706
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:55,540
And he didn't do it a lot, but you know, years ago, he's like, Hey, you shouldn't cuss on

1707
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:56,540
the show.

1708
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:57,540
And you know what?

1709
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:58,540
He's right.

1710
01:08:58,540 --> 01:08:59,540
But sometimes I can't help it.

1711
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:00,860
And we delay it out.

1712
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:01,860
But it's sad.

1713
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:02,860
I get it.

1714
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:03,860
He's older than me.

1715
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:04,860
I respect my elders, but I'm the boss.

1716
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:05,860
Does that make sense?

1717
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:06,860
Yeah.

1718
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:09,420
He told me how to do my show and I'm pissed off about it.

1719
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:12,780
That's why I had to fire him for his health.

1720
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:17,260
It has nothing to do with him and Steve pachanic fighting, even though I brought it up multiple

1721
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:18,260
times.

1722
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:22,420
It has nothing to do with him and me fighting, even though I am clearly very angry about

1723
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:23,420
it.

1724
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:28,020
And I resent that he told me not to swear on my radio show.

1725
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:30,260
And I'm still hanging on to it.

1726
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:36,780
Telling me not to swear on my radio show that I will get fined if I swear on top station.

1727
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:42,700
Someone politely offering me just a little bit of advice as a friend, obviously is him

1728
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:43,700
telling me.

1729
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:44,700
David Knight does sound like a stand-up guy.

1730
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:45,700
Yeah, he does.

1731
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:48,800
Telling Alex not to have Steve on is a blessing.

1732
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,100
That's what I would expect of somebody who worked for me.

1733
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,100
That's a friend.

1734
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,100
Yeah.

1735
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,380
Someone telling him, hey, come on, stop swearing.

1736
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:57,420
You're letting your passions get the best of you.

1737
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:01,420
Your job is contingent on you not swearing on anyone.

1738
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:03,620
It just seems like a guy who's got your back.

1739
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:04,620
Oh, man.

1740
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:05,620
Wow.

1741
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:06,620
Oh, boy.

1742
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:08,020
That wasn't because of Steve, though.

1743
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:09,020
You need to know that.

1744
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:10,020
Oh, sure.

1745
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,340
I respect my elders, but I'm the boss.

1746
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,340
Does that make sense?

1747
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:17,580
And then the last thing I want to do a touch on, because I know we're kind of...

1748
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,300
Stop asking me about David, or I'm going to keep saying more.

1749
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,740
I'm asking listeners to drop it, to drop it.

1750
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:24,540
I swear to God on my children.

1751
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:25,540
Hold on a minute.

1752
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:27,180
I'm not going to let you go.

1753
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:30,700
I swear to God on my children, Steve Pacinek had nothing to do with this.

1754
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:34,100
And David marched up and down the halls here saying he was going to quit for months.

1755
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,100
He's gone.

1756
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,100
Because of Steve Pacinek.

1757
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,100
Come back up.

1758
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,740
So he was marching up and down the hall saying he was going to quit.

1759
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,800
Because of Steve Pacinek.

1760
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,180
But Steve had nothing to do with this.

1761
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:43,180
Nothing to do with this.

1762
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,940
And Alex seems a little mad.

1763
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:45,940
Maybe.

1764
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:46,940
A little mad.

1765
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:50,340
Maybe people keep bringing up the real answer and it's making it hard for me to continue

1766
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:51,500
lying about it.

1767
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,860
But this caller didn't say that.

1768
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:54,860
No.

1769
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:59,500
This caller's question was, do you have a comment on that specific piece of bullshit

1770
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,420
that was on your show?

1771
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:02,940
Not just Owen's show.

1772
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:06,780
You've talked about the election sting on Infowars on Alex's show as well.

1773
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:07,780
Oh yeah.

1774
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:12,220
That is a very fair question for someone to ask a commentator.

1775
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,220
Right.

1776
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,380
Hey, you put this out.

1777
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:15,580
It is inaccurate.

1778
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:18,660
Do you have a statement on what you think?

1779
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:19,900
Would you like to clear that up?

1780
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,260
Instead, Alex starts yelling about David Knight.

1781
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:23,260
Great.

1782
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:26,860
Which makes you think that thinking about Steve makes him think about David.

1783
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,940
It makes you think that maybe.

1784
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:35,140
I swear on my kids lives who are strangely enough, uh, Oh my God, I just heard they died

1785
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,740
after I swear it on their lives.

1786
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:37,740
Shit.

1787
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,740
I will.

1788
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:39,740
I will.

1789
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:40,740
I think that might be my fault.

1790
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:41,740
I will eat David Knight to save my kids.

1791
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:42,740
What?

1792
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:43,740
Wait, what's going on?

1793
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:44,740
I don't understand.

1794
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:46,160
Anyway, look dude, had nothing to do with Steve.

1795
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,160
So I'm the bad guy.

1796
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:50,580
Just like Tony Montana says, point at me and say good night to the bad man.

1797
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:51,580
Okay.

1798
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,580
Alex Jones is a bad man.

1799
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:57,140
This is not a Howard Stern show where we have fighting on the show and fighting with the

1800
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:58,140
crew.

1801
01:11:58,140 --> 01:11:59,140
I'm not mad at the caller.

1802
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:01,060
I just can't handle it.

1803
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:03,780
I just can't handle it.

1804
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:07,420
Everybody's always got to have some drama.

1805
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:11,980
Steve Pechenik has nothing to do with my decision.

1806
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:16,100
David Knight saying to everyone that would listen, he was going to quit is the reason

1807
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,700
most places you say you're going to quit a couple of times.

1808
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:18,700
They go, go ahead and quit.

1809
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:19,700
How about 200 times?

1810
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,980
And I'm not mad at David.

1811
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:23,080
So I have respect for David.

1812
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,100
He got what he wanted.

1813
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:29,140
Oh, let's go ahead and talk to Jefferson in Virginia.

1814
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:30,140
Jefferson.

1815
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:31,140
You're on the air.

1816
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,140
Welcome.

1817
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,140
Wow.

1818
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,140
I feel welcome.

1819
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:35,140
Thank you.

1820
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,140
Yeah.

1821
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:37,140
Yeah.

1822
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,140
Oh boy.

1823
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:39,140
So a very respectful tribute to David Knight's time.

1824
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:45,180
90% calls on this show, I would say it's not accurate.

1825
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:51,820
I realize now that the thing that I don't want people to ask me about is going to be

1826
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:54,460
the only thing we talk about on a call in show.

1827
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:57,620
I love, I love the idea that this is the American journal.

1828
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:03,260
We're really getting the pulse of the country and the country is conflicted about why Alex

1829
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:08,140
fired David, except no one appears to be except Alex.

1830
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:12,980
Alex is the only person who's given contradictory reports on this.

1831
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:13,980
Oh God.

1832
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:14,980
Oh boy, buddy.

1833
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:19,980
I would just totally have accepted a number of explanations if they seemed consistent.

1834
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:20,980
Yeah.

1835
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,540
If you just kept saying the same one.

1836
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:23,540
Yeah.

1837
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:27,100
It's so overtly and insanely defensive over the one that you are telling me it's not.

1838
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,100
For no reason.

1839
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,100
For no reason.

1840
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,660
While you're filling in on his show.

1841
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:31,660
Here's what you could do.

1842
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:33,900
Hey, do you think it's because of Steve Pacenik?

1843
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:34,900
No, no, no.

1844
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:35,900
It had nothing to do with it.

1845
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,340
He's just wasn't feeling well.

1846
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:38,540
Hey, guess what?

1847
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:39,540
Alex is also a liar.

1848
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:40,540
Oh yeah, there's that.

1849
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,460
He could just say he had another heart attack.

1850
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,460
Ooh, that would be easy.

1851
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:44,460
Yeah.

1852
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:45,940
And then David would get on his Twitter and say, I didn't have a heart attack.

1853
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:46,940
And then who cares?

1854
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:47,940
Nobody would go forward.

1855
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:50,220
You're a liar by trade.

1856
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:51,780
No one cares.

1857
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:52,780
Yeah.

1858
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:57,260
Anyway, I was interested after listening to this American Journal to see how Alex holds

1859
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:58,260
up on his own show.

1860
01:13:58,260 --> 01:13:59,260
Of course.

1861
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:03,360
So a little bit after this, he takes this call from Jefferson and then he hangs out

1862
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,360
for a little bit.

1863
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,360
It's boring as hell.

1864
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:13,940
And then John Rappaport takes over for the last half hour and Alex jumps in and he realizes

1865
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:17,900
as soon as he gets on his own show that there were some calls that he didn't take on the

1866
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,440
American Journal.

1867
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,820
And so he calls them back.

1868
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,300
He has the producers call them back.

1869
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,300
Oh, boy.

1870
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:32,060
I was called by a listener and he was on air and reminded me that there's actually a federal

1871
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:37,340
law saying we can all be experimented on en masse, H.R. 4373.

1872
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,100
So we're all about documentation.

1873
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:43,900
The slugs over George Soros run media matters that literally are mercenaries against your

1874
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:49,900
very life are hoping you don't research this.

1875
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:55,140
I'm guessing that Alex means H.R. 4373 from the most recent session of Congress.

1876
01:14:55,140 --> 01:15:01,940
H.R. 4373 from the 2015-2016 session was the End Drunk Driving Act of 2016.

1877
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:04,460
So I'm guessing that's not what he's talking about.

1878
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:05,860
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1879
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:09,460
He still doesn't know they start over every Congress.

1880
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:14,140
H.R. 4373 in the most recent Congress is a bill called the Engineering Biology Research

1881
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,760
and Development Act of 2019.

1882
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:20,420
In December of last year it passed the House and was sent to the Senate.

1883
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:24,060
There it was sent to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, where no action

1884
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,940
has been taken on it since.

1885
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:27,680
It's essentially a dead bill.

1886
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:31,300
Even if this bill had passed, it wasn't something that would allow large-scale evil testing

1887
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:32,300
on people.

1888
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:35,700
It was basically a declaration that more grants should be given out to engineering biology

1889
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:40,000
fields to expand the pool of researchers working on those topics.

1890
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,760
In case you were curious, though, the End Drunk Driving Act of 2016 didn't even make

1891
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,820
it out of the House.

1892
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,360
That's not surprising.

1893
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,460
That's not surprising.

1894
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,460
Everybody loves drunk driving.

1895
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:53,080
Yeah, so Alex, you know, Media Matters is afraid of you looking into these things and

1896
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:58,440
finding out these bills that are stalled in committee exist that don't say what I'm gonna

1897
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,440
pretend they...

1898
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,440
Get the fuck out of here.

1899
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,440
You didn't look into this.

1900
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,440
It would terrify you.

1901
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,440
Yeah.

1902
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:07,180
If only you worked half as hard as David Knight pretends to, you'd be able to look into that

1903
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,380
bill and find out whatever.

1904
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:14,740
Anyway, Alex is sort of continuing a lot of the themes from the American Journal, like

1905
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:17,900
the whole, like, your placenta will be attacked by the vaccine.

1906
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:18,900
Sure.

1907
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:22,140
Yeah, you're never having a baby again when you take this.

1908
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:25,640
And the thing is, they're gonna commit this mass crime and have the nurses and the doctors

1909
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:29,420
all signed on to it, so when it turns out millions have been sterilized and millions

1910
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:34,620
die, slowly, everyone will enjoy it on the cover-up, and the Nazis call that the cement

1911
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:35,620
of blood.

1912
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:37,940
They'll now be corrupted and follow any order.

1913
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:38,940
Okay.

1914
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:40,620
All right.

1915
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:41,620
That sounds...

1916
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:42,620
Okay.

1917
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:43,620
Sounds scary.

1918
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:46,740
Can you sue for defamation on...

1919
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:48,340
On the behalf of, like, a field?

1920
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:49,340
Yeah.

1921
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,340
No, no, no.

1922
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:54,260
Not on behalf of them, but, like, could, like, Pfizer just be like, hey, I'm going to sue

1923
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:55,260
you.

1924
01:16:55,260 --> 01:17:00,260
Well, like, Fox News had to say all those things that they said were lies.

1925
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:01,500
Sidney Powell's Dominion stuff.

1926
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1927
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,300
They had to be like, hey, I'm sorry, we didn't, we lied about that.

1928
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:10,260
Now, obviously, they're gonna continue lying about it, but can you do that to Alex?

1929
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:11,260
I mean, nobody cares enough, I guess.

1930
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:12,700
I think it would be hard.

1931
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:18,860
But I mean, it seems like you can't just say that a company's vaccine will force you to

1932
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:20,460
never have a baby again?

1933
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:24,540
Yeah, it seems like it would be something that should be actionable in some way, but

1934
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,740
I don't know what the mechanism for it would be.

1935
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:30,300
Well, I mean, obviously, the vaccine itself cannot sue for defamation.

1936
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:31,300
It's true.

1937
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:32,300
Yeah.

1938
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:35,740
And all the people who, like, really do have some standing don't have the time and are

1939
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:36,740
public figures.

1940
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:37,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1941
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:41,440
So, like, Bill Gates would have a really tough time suing Alex for defamation.

1942
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:47,140
Even though, like, I mean, there is actual malice, Alex knows the things he's saying

1943
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:48,140
are not true.

1944
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:51,340
Yeah, could the people who actually created the vaccine sue?

1945
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:52,840
Conceivably.

1946
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:53,840
I don't know.

1947
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,840
I would be interested.

1948
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,840
Yeah.

1949
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,840
I don't know enough.

1950
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:57,840
That would be interesting.

1951
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:58,840
Yeah.

1952
01:17:58,840 --> 01:17:59,840
Let's do it.

1953
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,700
So, Alex gets another caller from earlier who's still waiting to talk to him.

1954
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:05,500
He has an interesting question.

1955
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,940
PB in Rhode Island, you're on the air, go ahead.

1956
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:08,940
Princess Bubblegum?

1957
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:09,940
Peanut Butter.

1958
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:12,580
Thank you for taking my call and thank you for everything you do.

1959
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:13,580
Thank you, brother.

1960
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:15,140
I just got a question for you.

1961
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:20,580
As far as the communist Chinese leaks of over 2 million communist Chinese agents pretty

1962
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:25,340
much released around the world, there was a list of 20 United States governors on that

1963
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:26,340
list.

1964
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:27,340
That just seems like a lot.

1965
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:31,780
What do you think of that and how come it hasn't really gained as much traction in the

1966
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:32,780
media?

1967
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:34,460
Because the mainstream media is sold out to the Chai-Coms.

1968
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,540
I mean, that's what I've been telling everybody forever and now it's come out.

1969
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:40,940
Oh, oh, maybe, maybe because it's not, that's not accurate.

1970
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:41,940
Yeah.

1971
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:42,940
Maybe?

1972
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:43,940
20 seems too high to ignore.

1973
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:44,940
Almost half.

1974
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:45,940
Yeah, 20 seems just too high to-

1975
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:50,100
Almost half of the governors in this country are Chinese secret agents.

1976
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:56,740
If you said like two governors had successfully become secret agents or whatever, that's more

1977
01:18:56,740 --> 01:19:01,100
believable than almost half the entire country is run by communist secret agents?

1978
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,100
Yeah.

1979
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,100
Yeah.

1980
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,100
Although that caller would have fit in on the American Journal.

1981
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,100
That's true.

1982
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:09,780
Alex is still optimistic at this point on the 18th that Trump is going to seize power

1983
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:13,220
and he reveals accidentally that Roger is still lying to him.

1984
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,220
Okay.

1985
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:18,620
I don't ever want to be over positive, but now I see Trump going after the globalist

1986
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:24,240
and I see all these arrests happening and I see them canceling Biden's military briefings

1987
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:27,900
and it tells me Trump's getting ready to drop the hammer.

1988
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:32,140
And I was told something about Trump, I'm not going to say whether I heard it from Trump

1989
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:40,980
or Roger Stone, but they told me when he was president elect four plus years ago that Trump

1990
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:43,340
expected this to come down to this.

1991
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:50,980
And so, look, I'm just telling the new world order, if you're looking for trouble, you

1992
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:51,980
came to the right place.

1993
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:52,980
Yeah.

1994
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:54,540
I heard this from either Trump or Roger Stone.

1995
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,540
Okay.

1996
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:56,540
Yeah, it was Roger Stone.

1997
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:57,540
Great.

1998
01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:02,980
In 2016, Roger Stone was saying that Trump planned on declaring martial law and seizing

1999
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:03,980
power.

2000
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:04,980
Yeah, there we go.

2001
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:05,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2002
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:06,980
Oh, cool.

2003
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:07,980
Glad you signed onto that.

2004
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:10,620
When he was president elect, Roger Stone told me that Trump would overthrow this democratic

2005
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:13,140
government and create a dictatorship.

2006
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:14,940
So I'm looking forward to that.

2007
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:15,940
Yeah.

2008
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:18,460
I felt like that was the most constitutional thing I could support.

2009
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:19,980
I mean, it's obvious.

2010
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:24,640
Like Trump is either, when he leaves office, he's either going to lose all of his money

2011
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,260
or he's going to wind up going to jail.

2012
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,700
I don't see him de-escalating.

2013
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:35,140
I mean, we say that, but like, why wouldn't he just be on the next season of The Masked

2014
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:36,140
Singer?

2015
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:37,540
Yeah, that's true.

2016
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:40,820
Why wouldn't he just reinvent himself as a pop star or something?

2017
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:41,820
I don't know.

2018
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:45,660
Probably because he's directly responsible for the deaths of what's going to wind up

2019
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:48,260
being 400 to 500,000 people.

2020
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:54,960
So, I mean, like obviously I'm on your side, but speaking from the other end, who cares?

2021
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,760
There's a giant portion of the population that doesn't care and will give him money.

2022
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,760
That's true.

2023
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:07,420
So like, so in America, that means there's another chapter, as long as, as long as he

2024
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:12,060
doesn't end up going to prison, even if he lost a ton of money, like rags to riches to

2025
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,200
rags to riches or whatever the fuck.

2026
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,700
It's not like he hasn't lost a ton of money before.

2027
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:17,700
Exactly.

2028
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:18,700
Yeah, that's true.

2029
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:24,160
So at this point, Alex has gone to break and he comes back and it's very jarring because

2030
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:28,100
he comes in with some rap music and then gets really weird.

2031
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:32,220
And I'm not going to cover this news in the next hour because there's more coming in.

2032
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:36,860
I want to really tell you what I think and the back of my brain, I'm still percolating

2033
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:46,340
what's happening, but Trump's going to make a run at them.

2034
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:48,180
I mean, that's the bottom line.

2035
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:52,300
And I've talked to really serious people, a lot of them at the Pentagon, and they're

2036
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:56,700
all very excited and are going to make a run at them.

2037
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:59,380
And they're getting the hearings ready to give them the political backing for what they

2038
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:00,380
need to do.

2039
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:02,300
They're already raiding facilities.

2040
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:04,580
It really is happening.

2041
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:08,300
And right here in Austin, the raids did happen in Germany.

2042
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:11,500
And let's just say this country is fighting for its life right now.

2043
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:15,140
And with 33 days left, we should see some big action the next week.

2044
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,980
Well, and I'm going to be taking off.

2045
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:17,980
Yes.

2046
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:18,980
Yeah.

2047
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:19,980
Yeah.

2048
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:23,780
So this is classic Alex, just him coming in and being like, I'm not going to cover this

2049
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:25,260
story because my gut doesn't.

2050
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:27,580
I'm going to cover it.

2051
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:29,580
Trump's going to make a run at him.

2052
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,100
Oh, man.

2053
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:32,100
Yeah.

2054
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:33,100
How funny.

2055
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:37,780
So Alex has just heard this Pentagon story, which he covers a little bit.

2056
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:38,780
Yeah.

2057
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:43,660
This is out of Axios, Bloomberg, all of it, acting Pentagon chief halts Biden transition

2058
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:48,140
briefings, signaling that Trump is not going to concede and going to use the military.

2059
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:51,540
So this is kind of what tipped him over the edge into, like, Trump is going to make a

2060
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:52,540
run at him.

2061
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:53,540
Sure.

2062
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:54,540
Sure.

2063
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:55,540
It's kind of bullshit.

2064
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:58,180
The Pentagon has said that the reason for the halt in transition activities is because

2065
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:02,620
many of the staff felt overwhelmed by the demands of the transition, but are, quote,

2066
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:05,820
still committed to a productive transition of power.

2067
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:08,180
We didn't used to have to do our jobs.

2068
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:09,940
That quote cut off at transition.

2069
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:11,660
I just said of power.

2070
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:12,660
Yeah.

2071
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:16,380
So maybe I don't want to mislead by adding to the quote.

2072
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:17,380
Right.

2073
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:21,220
You know, the people said that they decided to, quote, take a knee until after the holidays

2074
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:26,020
because, quote, the D.O.D. staff working the meetings were overwhelmed by the number of

2075
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:30,500
meetings, and, quote, these same senior leaders needed to do their day jobs and were being

2076
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:33,380
consumed by transition activities.

2077
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:37,060
I'm fairly cynical, but the way I see this, it's pretty clear that Trump's entire team

2078
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:40,220
is full of incompetence in the field of actually governing.

2079
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:41,220
Yeah.

2080
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:44,100
So it's not a surprise that the people he would choose would be the type of folks would

2081
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,060
be overwhelmed by work.

2082
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:49,460
This is still upsetting and horrible and everything, but I'm not sure it's proof that Trump is

2083
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:52,420
set to use the military to stay in power.

2084
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:53,420
No.

2085
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:58,260
When incompetence among officials that Trump has directly appointed is an option, it's

2086
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,780
almost always the right one.

2087
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:03,300
We can't get this shit done, and there's too many meetings.

2088
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,100
Oh, no.

2089
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,300
I could see that.

2090
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,300
Yeah.

2091
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:12,460
I could also see it being a, like, just almost sabotage, petulance kind of thing.

2092
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:13,460
Totally.

2093
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:18,500
I don't know if I think that it's an indication that Trump's going to use the military.

2094
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:24,740
I don't think so, but I mean, it does make so much sense for the transition team to be

2095
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:28,540
like, here's the intelligence that we expect you to give us.

2096
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:34,220
And they're like, ooh, we were told not to learn that kind of stuff, so we don't have

2097
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:35,220
it.

2098
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:40,820
Yeah, running out the clock to show that, ooh, we were drinking these last four years.

2099
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:42,500
We did nothing.

2100
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:44,580
We were allowed to act with impunity.

2101
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:45,580
Yeah.

2102
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:46,580
That's a possible explanation.

2103
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:47,580
Totally.

2104
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:48,580
And I don't know.

2105
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:49,580
I guess we'll have to see how it plays out.

2106
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:52,860
But that's really what is behind Alex's ha ha ha.

2107
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:55,260
Breaking news the entire Biden family is under house arrest.

2108
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:56,260
Oh, no.

2109
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,260
That's not good.

2110
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:58,260
Oh, no.

2111
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:05,540
So Alex has found this news story about the Supreme Court and someone yelling, Justice

2112
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:10,340
Roberts yelling about how we can't do this.

2113
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:13,860
We can't let Trump's cases come to court.

2114
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:18,460
But it looks bad waiting this long for McConnell to roll over, be a Chiacom agent, the Supreme

2115
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:23,140
Court roll over, be Chiacom agents, have Roberts screaming and yelling, saying the Democrats

2116
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:24,660
will burn America.

2117
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:30,840
So we're all scared of Trump's martial law to counter their martial law.

2118
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:39,980
But we got the justice that the opposing chief justice saying we can't do this.

2119
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:44,540
Because if we do, screaming at the other justices who all crapped their pants and got in line,

2120
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:48,660
the other eight, that's in the news now.

2121
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:54,860
Credible sources, congressman sources, the aides, talk to their aides that he pistol

2122
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:55,860
wept him.

2123
01:25:55,860 --> 01:26:01,380
He he he screamed at him for hours that they'll be riots, they'll be because that's what Black

2124
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:05,060
Lives Matter and ten point six million dollars of B.S. was.

2125
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:06,780
So this story isn't true.

2126
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:11,780
Critics just saw a viral online post about it where a man named Matt Patrick argued at

2127
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:16,320
a December 14th meeting of the Texas electors that the Supreme Court was too cowardly to

2128
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,240
deal with the issues in front of them.

2129
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:22,160
He claimed to have heard a story from a Supreme Court staffer that Justice Roberts yelled

2130
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:26,100
at fellow judges that they needed to dismiss the Texas attorney general's case, saying

2131
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:30,260
that he didn't care about Bush versus Gore because there are riots going on and there

2132
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:31,620
weren't in 2000.

2133
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:32,620
Sure.

2134
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:34,880
This man did not hear this story from a staffer.

2135
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,500
He read it on right wing extremist Hal Turner's website.

2136
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:42,420
Someone wrote Hal Turner anonymously claiming to be a Supreme Court staffer and told this

2137
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:48,260
story, which Hal reported on December 12th, with absolutely no verification whatsoever.

2138
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:52,620
There's also very strong reasons just on its face to not believe this story, like what

2139
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:56,900
was posted and pointed out by Snopes, the fact that the Supreme Court justices have

2140
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:59,940
not met in person for months because of COVID-19.

2141
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:00,940
There is that.

2142
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:06,580
There's not really a closed door meeting that this staffer, alleged staffer, could have

2143
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:07,580
overheard.

2144
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:08,580
Yeah.

2145
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:12,480
But you could almost, you could almost buy John Roberts just because I'm sure, at least

2146
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:18,620
in some small way, he has to resent Barrett and Kavanaugh because his job used to be so

2147
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:22,040
much more solemn and like respected.

2148
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:25,700
And now with Barrett and Kavanaugh on there, he's kind of an idiot.

2149
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:26,700
Yeah.

2150
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:32,580
You know, whenever you have Notorious on there, you know, it's like she gives you a gravitas

2151
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:37,420
of the Supreme Court of like, look, this is what the Supreme Court can do.

2152
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:42,540
And now, like, Barrett writes her decisions in crayon and it's like, I don't think you're

2153
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:43,540
supposed to be here.

2154
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:44,540
Yeah.

2155
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:46,620
And I can't think of Kavanaugh without thinking of Squeeze.

2156
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:47,620
Yeah.

2157
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:48,620
Yeah.

2158
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:49,620
Yeah.

2159
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:50,620
Yeah.

2160
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:51,620
Poor Judge Roberts.

2161
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:52,620
Oh, I'm so sad for him.

2162
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:54,100
I'm so sad for- Or maybe not.

2163
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:58,540
But going down in history as a moron is going to be a real bummer.

2164
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:01,940
Speaking of people who are going to go down in history as morons and are looked as such

2165
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:05,540
now, David Icke is not on the show.

2166
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:07,420
However, his son is.

2167
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:10,460
Then I'll take calls for a couple of segments.

2168
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:15,180
And then David Icke's son, who's quite the filmmaker, is going to be joining us with

2169
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:16,380
some big breaking news.

2170
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:21,260
I love these guys talking about like merits and like getting by based on what you do,

2171
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:22,260
what you produce.

2172
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:23,260
Bootstraps.

2173
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:24,260
We're going to talk to David Icke's son.

2174
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:27,260
We're going to talk to someone who- Someone who's such a great filmmaker that

2175
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:31,260
you have to introduce him, not by his name, but as David Icke's son.

2176
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:32,260
Yeah.

2177
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:33,260
David Icke's son.

2178
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:34,260
Yeah.

2179
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:35,260
Wow.

2180
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:36,260
Oh, bad.

2181
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:37,260
Wow.

2182
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:38,260
That is sad.

2183
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:39,260
Yep.

2184
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:40,260
I would not like to be David Icke's son.

2185
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:41,260
He seems to enjoy it.

2186
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:42,260
Sure.

2187
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:47,460
So Alex has noticed that Howard Stern has been doing some segments where they make fun

2188
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:48,460
of Alex.

2189
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:49,460
Sure.

2190
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:50,460
They have been doing that for a while.

2191
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:51,460
Oh.

2192
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:54,780
And lately, I guess, Alex wants to talk about it.

2193
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:56,340
I don't know.

2194
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:59,180
This is really interesting because they are making fun of Alex.

2195
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:00,180
Yeah.

2196
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:01,900
It's very clearly mocking him.

2197
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:02,900
Yeah.

2198
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,180
Alex might have a different angle on it.

2199
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:05,180
Interesting.

2200
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:09,460
But Howard Stern still has a gigantic show, number one show on XM, probably just 5 million

2201
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:12,260
people a day conservatively that tune in.

2202
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:15,940
And he's up there every week now doing these puppet show videos.

2203
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:18,700
They're very viral and send us a lot of new listeners.

2204
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:22,340
So I don't want to attack Stern too much so he gets in trouble and can't make it.

2205
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:25,900
I know Stern said he was a listener before and had me on a few times as a guest.

2206
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:32,100
I was used to go on his network like once a month for years till somebody killed him.

2207
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,460
And so I think overall, Stern's trying to actually warn people through the show.

2208
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:36,460
Maybe I'm wrong.

2209
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:37,460
Yeah.

2210
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:38,460
Maybe you're wrong.

2211
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,460
Oh, man.

2212
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:43,900
So I think that Stern is like subtly trying to get Infowars messages out on his show by

2213
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:47,500
making fun of me, and I don't want to get too much attention on it.

2214
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,980
So he can't do it anymore.

2215
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:49,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2216
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:50,980
What the fuck?

2217
01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:51,980
Oh, man.

2218
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:55,980
Yeah, the character of Alex is largely like selling shit.

2219
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:56,980
Yeah.

2220
01:29:56,980 --> 01:30:03,660
I need to, I like the way that he brings me more attention and doesn't actually affect

2221
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:09,760
whether or not people believe my bullshit, but I don't like having to say nice things

2222
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:10,760
about it.

2223
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:11,760
Mm-hmm.

2224
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,760
Yeah.

2225
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,340
So Alex has got this idea about Justice John Roberts.

2226
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:16,700
He's being a coward and all this.

2227
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:19,640
He's yelling behind closed doors.

2228
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:21,100
And actually, Alex knows why.

2229
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:26,220
Well, that's Roberts getting a call from Holder that's got all the, and Obama that knows about

2230
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:31,740
him and his kidnapped kids and how his adopted kids were kidnapped reportedly.

2231
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:34,460
And so he's on a very short chain.

2232
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:35,940
And so he's there going, we got to do this.

2233
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:36,940
We got to do this.

2234
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:37,940
And so he's a big problem.

2235
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:38,940
I guess.

2236
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:43,780
I guess there's blackmail, a good thing Alex threw in reportedly there.

2237
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:44,780
Yeah.

2238
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:48,500
Yeah, the Supreme court, notoriously a friend of the Obama administration.

2239
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:49,500
Yeah.

2240
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,500
Yeah.

2241
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:51,500
Yeah.

2242
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,540
Obama and Eric Holder are really coming through right now.

2243
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:54,540
Yeah.

2244
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:55,540
Yeah.

2245
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:56,540
For...

2246
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:57,540
Good timing.

2247
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:58,540
I mean like what, what, why?

2248
01:30:58,540 --> 01:30:59,540
Why?

2249
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:00,540
What are they doing?

2250
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:03,320
What have they been doing?

2251
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:13,780
They want to get the individual mandate back.

2252
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:15,740
We're going to do it this time guys.

2253
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:21,020
Now that we know his kids were stolen and that's why he's got them, Holder is ready

2254
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:22,540
to pull the trigger now.

2255
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:23,540
Yep.

2256
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:24,540
That must be it.

2257
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:25,540
That must be it.

2258
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:33,740
You'd assume that a number of things would have gone differently if Eric Holder had some

2259
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:34,800
blackmail on.

2260
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:39,300
That would suggest that when Holder lost, he also was telling him, Hey, look, I'm planning

2261
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:40,860
on losing this one.

2262
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,900
So make it convincing, I guess.

2263
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:43,900
Jesus.

2264
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:44,900
Ridiculous.

2265
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:45,900
Yeah.

2266
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:46,900
So Alex takes more calls.

2267
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:50,580
And, uh, this, uh, this one, this caller here, uh, wants a civil war.

2268
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:54,940
If they don't do anything about this, I say, we need to just have a civil war because there's

2269
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:56,740
no way we'll survive under Biden.

2270
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:57,740
It's not about us.

2271
01:31:57,740 --> 01:31:58,740
It's about future generations.

2272
01:31:58,740 --> 01:31:59,740
We need to make moves now.

2273
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:00,740
Sacrifice our lives.

2274
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:03,740
Well, I know people are ready to fight and that's what scares the enemy.

2275
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:07,300
My issue is, and thank you for the call, God bless you, Heather.

2276
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:08,540
I wouldn't even call it a civil war.

2277
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:12,180
And I mean, this is a foreign occupation with collaborators.

2278
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:16,220
So this is a recapturing of America operation.

2279
01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:20,180
So I don't, I think, I think there are a lot of forces that aren't going to put up with

2280
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:21,180
this.

2281
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:22,180
The Chicom is pissing on us.

2282
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:23,740
His problem seems to be semantics.

2283
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:24,740
Yeah.

2284
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:25,740
It sounds like that.

2285
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:26,740
Yeah.

2286
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:31,460
I do not appreciate how casual so many people are with banding civil war about.

2287
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:32,460
It's pretty fucked up.

2288
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:33,460
Yeah.

2289
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,460
I think we need a civil war.

2290
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:37,240
You know, just, that's one of those things you talk about in the, you know, we just lay

2291
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:39,580
down our lives for the future generations.

2292
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:42,860
We should all just die fighting against our fellow citizens.

2293
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:43,860
Yeah.

2294
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:45,420
Look, my problem is terminology.

2295
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:46,420
Yes, exactly.

2296
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:47,420
My problem with your...

2297
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:48,420
Exactly.

2298
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:49,420
That's the real problem.

2299
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:50,420
I don't like Alex's rebuttal.

2300
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:51,420
No, no, no.

2301
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:52,420
It's not good.

2302
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:53,420
It's not a civil war.

2303
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:54,620
It's a recapturing.

2304
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:57,460
It implies that he's okay with everything but the word.

2305
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:58,460
Yes.

2306
01:32:58,460 --> 01:32:59,460
Pretty much.

2307
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:02,620
So we get to David Icke's son and we're not going to listen to this interview.

2308
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:05,820
I just have one clip because it's classic Alex.

2309
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:11,940
They're not going to stop until we stand up as a race, as a species and stop them.

2310
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:13,980
I mean, I've heard so many times through this.

2311
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:14,980
I'm sure you have as well.

2312
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:17,940
You've been asked the question is, when does this end?

2313
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:23,180
And the simple answer to that is it ends when we stop doing it, ends when we stop allowing

2314
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,620
them to control us.

2315
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:25,620
You know, a bully...

2316
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:27,460
Did you know that's basically a Thomas Everson quote.

2317
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:29,580
He was asked, how bad will tyrants get?

2318
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:30,580
How bad will they...

2319
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:31,580
How far will they push?

2320
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:33,780
And he said, exactly as far as you let them.

2321
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:34,780
Oh God.

2322
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:35,780
Yeah, absolutely.

2323
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:36,780
Yeah, totally.

2324
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:37,780
Yeah.

2325
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:38,780
Fake Thomas Jefferson quote.

2326
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:39,780
Still doing the TJ.

2327
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:40,780
Yeah.

2328
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:41,780
Well, boy.

2329
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:48,740
So we have one last clip here, Jordan, and this is a mic down clip because it is a return

2330
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:49,740
to form.

2331
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:50,740
Okay.

2332
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:52,980
It is Alex talking over You Belong to the City.

2333
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:53,980
Sure.

2334
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:54,980
I'm excited.

2335
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:55,980
Yeah.

2336
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:56,980
We haven't heard a good one of those in a while.

2337
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:57,980
Yeah.

2338
01:33:57,980 --> 01:33:59,500
And then I think it just ends perfectly.

2339
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,580
This is like a nice little ride.

2340
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:06,860
It's not his best rant over the song, but the coda to the end, much like the piano in

2341
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:07,860
Layla.

2342
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:08,860
Sure.

2343
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:09,860
Great.

2344
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:10,860
Makes the song.

2345
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:11,860
Okay.

2346
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:39,620
The only thing you need to know is that this

2347
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:46,300
enemy attack is a desperate counter offensive.

2348
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:49,340
We are winning.

2349
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:50,820
Humanity is awakening.

2350
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:53,420
Humanity holds the keys to human destiny.

2351
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:59,460
And so as long as you don't submit and as long as you don't hate yourself and as long

2352
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:04,580
as you know how amazing you are and that spark and that splinter of God's mind that created

2353
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:07,660
you, there's nothing they can do against you.

2354
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:14,860
As your life is closer to death, every minute becomes more valuable every second until you're

2355
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:20,020
finally gone at the next level and then there's eternity and nothing but consciousness.

2356
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:23,180
So you need to transcend that fear.

2357
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:25,580
He's about to take over here in just a minute or so.

2358
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:28,700
Kathy in Alaska, go ahead and thanks for holding.

2359
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:29,700
Hello?

2360
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:31,700
Oh, boy.

2361
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:33,700
Oh, man.

2362
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:46,420
Oh, just like Alex is like an angry Alan Watts, life ticks away and then there's just eternity

2363
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:47,420
and then...

2364
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:49,660
I don't know why I can't get this.

2365
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:55,660
I just want now to hear Carl Sagan's pale blue dot speech, but over you belong to the

2366
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:56,660
city.

2367
01:35:56,660 --> 01:36:04,660
Is there something really great about that song and Alex's weird rambling space nonsense?

2368
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:07,700
It's just so good.

2369
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:16,340
One day we will all fly away on Saturn's rings and there's nothing that evil can do about

2370
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:20,500
it.

2371
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:26,540
It is great and then just like the reality that comes crashing, crashing.

2372
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,380
The music dies.

2373
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:30,380
And then she's like long pause.

2374
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:31,380
Hello?

2375
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:32,380
Hello?

2376
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:33,380
It's just so great.

2377
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:35,260
Are you going to keep playing You Belong to the City?

2378
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:36,720
I wanted to talk over it.

2379
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:37,720
So great.

2380
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,720
So great.

2381
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:45,580
I would probably listen to Alex talk over that song for like an hour on the treadmill.

2382
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:46,580
It would get me there.

2383
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:47,580
Yeah.

2384
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:48,580
It would help me.

2385
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:49,580
Oh, totally.

2386
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:50,580
Yeah.

2387
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:55,620
If he was just going to switch to Eckhart Tolle tapes, but only over music, just like

2388
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:59,820
a banging soundtrack that he talks shit over, I would listen to that.

2389
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:04,940
You referenced, I think it was on our last episode, the album of Paul Stanley song introductions.

2390
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:05,940
Yes.

2391
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:06,940
Yeah.

2392
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:07,940
People let me get this off my chest.

2393
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:08,940
Yeah.

2394
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:14,180
I think it would be awesome if Alex would record just an hour of freeform improvisational

2395
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:15,180
100%.

2396
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:16,780
speeches over that sax.

2397
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:18,700
Sweary Carrie basically did it.

2398
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:19,700
Yeah.

2399
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:20,700
I mean, she sang.

2400
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:21,700
A little.

2401
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:22,700
She sang, but yeah.

2402
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:23,700
Yeah.

2403
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:29,100
I would love to hear Alex do a William Shatner spoken word style album over You Belong to

2404
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:30,100
the City.

2405
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:31,100
The entire, that's the entire background.

2406
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:32,100
Yeah.

2407
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:33,100
Oh man.

2408
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:34,100
Just constant.

2409
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:35,860
That would win back a lot of hearts and minds, I think.

2410
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:40,700
That would win a Grammy.

2411
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:45,700
Open mic eagle is snubbed again, but AJ winds up in the top pop charts.

2412
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:48,820
This is going to be his first step to Egon it.

2413
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:57,780
He's going to get a, what would it be called, a delayed Oscar for his star turn in A Scanner

2414
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:58,780
Darkly.

2415
01:37:58,780 --> 01:37:59,780
Naturally.

2416
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:00,780
That cameo of him yelling into a bullhorn.

2417
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:01,780
Yeah.

2418
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:05,340
They're going to mistake his end game for Avengers End Game and give a retroactive Oscar

2419
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:06,340
for that.

2420
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:07,340
Okay.

2421
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:08,340
You can have two Oscars.

2422
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:09,340
Yeah.

2423
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:10,340
Yeah.

2424
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:11,340
Yeah.

2425
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,180
And then he's going to get a Tony for his version of Hamilton.

2426
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:14,180
Right.

2427
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,180
But it's Jefferson.

2428
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:16,180
I don't know.

2429
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:17,180
It's all not true.

2430
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:18,180
It's all not true.

2431
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:19,180
Jefferson's ripped.

2432
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:23,820
It's shirtless the whole time.

2433
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:28,420
And then he gets an Emmy for that time he was on The View.

2434
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:29,420
Yeah.

2435
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:30,420
I would give him an Emmy.

2436
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:31,420
Egon.

2437
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:32,420
Egon it.

2438
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:39,860
So this, somebody is not going to get any awards for as the American Journal.

2439
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:42,860
That show sucks.

2440
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:44,820
I hate to say it because I got really excited.

2441
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:46,100
I'll be honest.

2442
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:50,700
Whatever like the David Knight firing happened I was very confused.

2443
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:56,420
And then when I learned the next day that Alex was like really showing some go get em

2444
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:57,420
spirit.

2445
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:58,420
Yeah.

2446
01:38:58,420 --> 01:38:59,420
Yeah.

2447
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:00,420
Some vim.

2448
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:01,420
Some vigor.

2449
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:04,620
I was pumped because I was like this could be really fun.

2450
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:07,960
And instead he just complains about David Knight and takes boring calls like it's not

2451
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:08,960
a good show.

2452
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:09,960
Yeah.

2453
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:12,500
It would actually be a better show with Harrison Smith hosting it.

2454
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:13,500
Right.

2455
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:14,500
Because he's boring as hell.

2456
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,500
Yeah.

2457
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:19,740
He's the guy who can just be a cardboard cutout with the callers.

2458
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:20,740
Right.

2459
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:21,740
That's what he is.

2460
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:22,740
That's what Washington.

2461
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:23,740
Yeah.

2462
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:25,220
That guy has a little bit of competence though.

2463
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:26,940
I'm not saying that he's just.

2464
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:27,940
I think he's great.

2465
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:28,940
Yeah.

2466
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:29,940
Yeah.

2467
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:30,940
He does what he does really well.

2468
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:31,940
Yeah.

2469
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:34,440
He's like you know the straight man in a comedy team where you think they're doing nothing

2470
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:35,440
but it's.

2471
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,440
Yeah.

2472
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:37,440
No he's Dave Foley.

2473
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:38,440
There's nuance to that nothing.

2474
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:39,440
Yeah.

2475
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,440
Yeah.

2476
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:41,440
Harrison Smith would just be nothing.

2477
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,440
Yeah.

2478
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:43,440
Yeah.

2479
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,440
Yeah.

2480
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:45,440
He's not going to.

2481
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:49,660
I think the power of this entire time was in yelling about conflicting reports about

2482
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:50,660
David Knight.

2483
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:51,660
Totally.

2484
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:52,660
Totally.

2485
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:57,660
Just because he's petty and he's angry and wants to save face about firing old Greybeard.

2486
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:58,660
Oh man.

2487
01:39:58,660 --> 01:39:59,660
I don't know.

2488
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:00,660
It's weird.

2489
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:06,920
I still am not convinced 100% that it was Steve but like his performance makes me think

2490
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:07,920
it was.

2491
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:08,920
Yeah.

2492
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:09,920
Yeah.

2493
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:10,920
Yeah.

2494
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:11,920
And that's not good.

2495
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:12,920
If I was 50-50 now I'm at 70-30.

2496
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:16,360
But every time he denies it it goes up 10%.

2497
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:17,420
You know?

2498
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:18,420
That kind of thing.

2499
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:19,420
Yeah.

2500
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:20,420
Yeah.

2501
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:23,820
And I guess it can't be financial because if Alex is doing this it would require the

2502
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:24,820
crew.

2503
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:25,820
Yeah.

2504
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:26,820
That would be there for David anyway.

2505
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:27,820
Yeah.

2506
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:30,940
So I guess salary if David Knight was making a bunch.

2507
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:31,940
I don't know.

2508
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:32,940
Yeah.

2509
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:33,940
I don't trust.

2510
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:34,940
I don't trust any of this shit.

2511
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:38,740
Well I mean Corsi whenever we found out how much fucking money he was making.

2512
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:39,740
Yeah.

2513
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:40,740
But he had juice.

2514
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:41,740
Yeah that's true.

2515
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:42,740
Corsi was a name.

2516
01:40:42,740 --> 01:40:43,740
Corsi was a name.

2517
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:45,980
But Knight had a long career there.

2518
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:52,060
I assume he hopefully got a 3% a 3% raise every year.

2519
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:54,740
I bet he started in 2009 at 5.15 an hour.

2520
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:56,540
Give him a cola at least.

2521
01:40:56,540 --> 01:40:57,540
No benefits.

2522
01:40:57,540 --> 01:40:58,540
Cost of living man.

2523
01:40:58,540 --> 01:40:59,540
No no no.

2524
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:00,540
No insurance.

2525
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:03,940
There's a soda machine in the break room.

2526
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:06,500
I yeah I don't know.

2527
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:09,740
I would assume it's so hard to say.

2528
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:13,420
I always think like man they must be getting paid a lot because this is degrading work.

2529
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:14,420
Totally.

2530
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:18,220
But I think if you're in you realize you can't go anywhere else.

2531
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:19,220
Sure.

2532
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:20,220
Now David Knight could.

2533
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:23,940
Like we said he could go to Newsmax or OAN really easily and probably get a decent contract.

2534
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:24,940
Sure.

2535
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:29,520
But 2010, 2011 there wasn't anywhere that David Knight could go.

2536
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:31,900
Maybe the blaze but that didn't exist that whole thing.

2537
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:32,900
No no no.

2538
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:35,980
He was once he once he walked in the door he was stuck for a while.

2539
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:36,980
Yeah.

2540
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:42,180
And David Knight so he wasn't going to cause enough problems elsewhere to justify a firing

2541
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:44,860
until Steve Pajitnik says something batshit.

2542
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:45,860
Yeah.

2543
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:46,860
And he's like guys.

2544
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:47,860
Another thing that was batshit.

2545
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:49,740
We can't do this.

2546
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:50,940
This is my final straw.

2547
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:54,200
And it kind of makes you think because David Knight was saying that like the last straw

2548
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,980
for him and Steve was the Las Vegas shooting.

2549
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:57,980
Yeah.

2550
01:41:57,980 --> 01:42:00,620
And after that Steve didn't appear on Alex's show for quite a while.

2551
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:01,620
Right right right right.

2552
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:04,980
So it makes you think that maybe Alex listened to him at that point.

2553
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:05,980
Yeah.

2554
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:10,540
And since David was the one who was being like look this is really fucked up.

2555
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:11,540
Well I mean.

2556
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:12,540
We can't allow him to.

2557
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:15,940
We do know that David has told him not to have certain people on in the past.

2558
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:17,740
I know I heard Alex complain about that.

2559
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:18,740
Exactly.

2560
01:42:18,740 --> 01:42:19,740
Yeah yeah yeah.

2561
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:20,740
He was very offended.

2562
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:21,740
Yeah.

2563
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:23,780
And that's why Black Lives Matter made 10.6 billion dollars.

2564
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:24,780
Exactly.

2565
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:26,220
And we had to fire David Knight.

2566
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:27,220
Yeah.

2567
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:30,860
I think this story will unravel further in the coming days.

2568
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:37,020
But since Alex is theoretically taking a week off that leaves us without anything for a

2569
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:38,020
while.

2570
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:41,100
So I was thinking maybe we should do a Project Camelot on Friday maybe.

2571
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:42,620
Ooh that might be fun.

2572
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:44,100
Or we'll figure out something.

2573
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:45,100
We'll see.

2574
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:49,540
I'm not gonna do a David Knight episode on Christmas Eve.

2575
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:50,700
No no no no no.

2576
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:51,700
That's not a present for anyone.

2577
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:55,440
I know that not everybody celebrates all the same holidays but for those who do that would

2578
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:56,440
be a shit present.

2579
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:57,440
Yeah yeah yeah.

2580
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:58,440
Sorry about that.

2581
01:42:58,440 --> 01:42:59,440
Don't want to do that to you.

2582
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:00,440
No not interested.

2583
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:01,440
Anyway we'll be back.

2584
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,440
But until then we have a website.

2585
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:03,440
We do have a website.

2586
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:04,440
It's knowledgefight.com.

2587
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:05,440
Yeah.

2588
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,440
Or else on Twitter.

2589
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:07,440
We are on Twitter.

2590
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:08,440
It's at knowledge underscore fight net.

2591
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:09,440
Go to bed Jordan.

2592
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:10,440
Or else whoa whoa whoa on Facebook.

2593
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:11,440
We are Facebook.

2594
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:14,460
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

2595
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:15,460
doing God's work.

2596
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:16,460
Yeah.

2597
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:17,460
Or else we'll be back.

2598
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:18,660
But until then I'm Neo.

2599
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:19,660
I'm Leo.

2600
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:20,660
I'm DZX Clark.

2601
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:21,660
I'm Daryl Rundis.

2602
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:23,380
I'm not ending this show because of Steve Pachannik.

2603
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:24,380
I swear.

2604
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:26,300
I swear I'm not ending this show.

2605
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:29,740
Right now we're about to finish this show and it has nothing to do with Steve Pachannik.

2606
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:34,020
It just has everything to do with, look, Jordan has been tired for like the last 30 minutes

2607
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:35,780
or so and he wants to end the show.

2608
01:43:35,780 --> 01:43:37,780
I would like to keep the show going.

2609
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:38,780
You've got to fire Jordan.

2610
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:40,940
I would like the show to keep going for another half hour.

2611
01:43:40,940 --> 01:43:41,940
Replace him with Melania.

2612
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:44,060
But look, everybody needs a break.

2613
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:45,620
Jordan looks like he's gonna have a heart attack.

2614
01:43:45,620 --> 01:43:46,620
He's ashen.

2615
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:50,060
Anyway, finances are tight so we can't do another half hour.

2616
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:52,380
It has nothing to do with Steve.

2617
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:53,380
Andy in Kansas.

2618
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:54,380
You're on the air.

2619
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:55,380
Thanks for holding.

2620
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:56,380
Hello Alex.

2621
01:43:56,380 --> 01:43:57,380
I'm a first time caller.

2622
01:43:57,380 --> 01:43:58,380
I'm a huge fan.

2623
01:43:58,380 --> 01:43:59,380
I love your work.

2624
01:43:59,380 --> 01:43:59,880
I love you.
