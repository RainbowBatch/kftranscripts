N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.880 --> 00:19.600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.160
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

00:25.160 --> 00:30.000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys, knowledgefight.

00:30.000 --> 00:47.080
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:47.080 --> 00:55.760
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us.

00:55.760 --> 00:56.760
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan.

00:56.760 --> 00:57.760
I love your work.

00:57.760 --> 00:58.760
Knowledgefight.com.

00:58.760 --> 00:59.760
N-N-N-N-N-Knowledgefight.com.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.760
I love you.

01:00.760 --> 01:01.760
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight.

01:01.760 --> 01:02.760
I'm Dan.

01:02.760 --> 01:03.760
I'm Jordan.

01:03.760 --> 01:04.760
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little

01:04.760 --> 01:05.760
bit about Alex Jones.

01:05.760 --> 01:06.760
Oh indeed we are Dan.

01:06.760 --> 01:07.760
Yes.

01:07.760 --> 01:08.760
Dan?

01:08.760 --> 01:09.760
Yes.

01:09.760 --> 01:10.760
Quick question for you.

01:10.760 --> 01:11.760
What's up Jordan?

01:11.760 --> 01:12.760
What's your bright spot today?

01:12.760 --> 01:15.680
My bright spot today is that wonderful intersection of aspiration and limitations.

01:15.680 --> 01:22.160
All right, are you talking about finishing an entire Waffle House meal?

01:22.160 --> 01:23.160
No.

01:23.160 --> 01:30.560
I got some sheet metal from the local hardware store the other day because it dawned on me

01:30.560 --> 01:37.240
that I love breakfast sandwiches and I can make them myself if I could make eggs round.

01:37.240 --> 01:41.600
And I was like, if I just get some sheet metal, I could make a round thing that I could put

01:41.600 --> 01:42.600
in a pan.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.080
You're making your own cutouts.

01:45.080 --> 01:46.320
You're making cookie cutters.

01:46.320 --> 01:47.320
Basically, yeah.

01:47.320 --> 01:48.320
Out of sheet metal.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.320
Yep.

01:49.320 --> 01:50.320
You can just buy them.

01:50.320 --> 01:53.720
Well, that's the limitations aspect.

01:53.720 --> 01:58.920
So I spent a while cutting up some metal and I didn't cut myself or anything, so that's

01:58.920 --> 01:59.920
a plus.

01:59.920 --> 02:00.920
Well that's good.

02:00.920 --> 02:01.920
That's a plus.

02:01.920 --> 02:06.220
But yeah, I got through a couple trials of it and you know, like the egg kept seeping

02:06.220 --> 02:10.680
out from under it because it's not perfectly, it's like, ah, what can I do?

02:10.680 --> 02:11.680
How can I fix this?

02:11.680 --> 02:14.840
And so I Googled it and I was like, oh, they cost eight bucks for four of them.

02:14.840 --> 02:15.840
Oh yeah, yeah.

02:15.840 --> 02:16.840
It costs nothing.

02:16.840 --> 02:17.840
I was like, okay, I'll just order those.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.160
I have no idea why you bought, why did you buy sheet metal?

02:20.160 --> 02:21.800
What was your thought process on that?

02:21.800 --> 02:27.080
I was taking a walk to get out of the house and I saw the hardware store and I like the

02:27.080 --> 02:32.560
hardware guys and I was like, oh, I've been, I had that thought about round eggs.

02:32.560 --> 02:37.120
Why don't I see if they have anything I could, uh, sheet metal in there?

02:37.120 --> 02:39.960
And so I did and well, it felt fun.

02:39.960 --> 02:40.960
Yeah.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.480
The aspiration phase felt really fun.

02:42.480 --> 02:43.480
Like I'm being crafty.

02:43.480 --> 02:46.520
I'm trying to build something and I did succeed.

02:46.520 --> 02:47.720
It just wasn't that good.

02:47.720 --> 02:48.720
Sure.

02:48.720 --> 02:49.720
I made something that worked.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.240
I made egg patties.

02:51.240 --> 02:52.240
Sure.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.560
They just weren't great and they did leak a little bit.

02:55.560 --> 02:56.560
But they were round.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.720
You win some, you lose some.

02:57.720 --> 02:58.720
Right.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.720
I think that's great.

02:59.720 --> 03:02.600
I consider it a partial victory that I then forfeited to buying a couple.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.600
I agree.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.200
I think that you even tried to construct your own as a victory in and of itself.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.200
Yeah.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.200
I feel better.

03:09.200 --> 03:13.360
I feel better for trying, but also qualified success, qualified success.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.000
I think you are though technically a weekend warrior now, Dan.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
I have that urge.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Yeah.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
That's what you do.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Yep.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I need a sink to fix.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
I need a, I need these projects.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yes.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
To fail on.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
I'm going to build a god damn chair.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.920
I'm going to build a god damn chair today.

03:29.920 --> 03:35.360
I'm going to try really hard and then I'm going to buy a chair.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.360
That's my weekend.

03:36.360 --> 03:37.360
Yeah.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.340
It's a good thing you don't have any like trimming to do because you would have a series

03:40.340 --> 03:42.880
of chainsaws and shit.

03:42.880 --> 03:43.880
That would be a nightmare.

03:43.880 --> 03:44.880
No, probably not.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.640
I'd probably stop just short of that.

03:46.640 --> 03:47.640
What's your bright spot?

03:47.640 --> 03:51.720
My bright spot, Dan, is a, I don't know if you recall, do you remember a few weeks ago

03:51.720 --> 03:54.000
when I talked to you about the Mandalorian?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Um, yeah.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.800
And it was, what I said to you was that it was, it was essentially, it was like a, it's,

04:00.800 --> 04:01.800
it's junk food.

04:01.800 --> 04:05.200
You know, it's everything you want, you know?

04:05.200 --> 04:11.640
And the season finale was such that it was just, I can't even, without spoilers, I can't

04:11.640 --> 04:16.680
even begin to describe it because it was like I could feel myself in the writer's room.

04:16.680 --> 04:19.080
Did they say that Baby Yoda's name isn't Grogu?

04:19.080 --> 04:20.640
No, but if only they could.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.800
I thought I would figure that would be a nice twist.

04:22.800 --> 04:27.800
It would be nice if the twist ending, the person who arrived was like, nah, nah, nah,

04:27.800 --> 04:29.280
nah, nah, nah, you're Baby Yoda.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.280
Moving on.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.840
Let's get out of here.

04:31.840 --> 04:32.840
Grogu is dead.

04:32.840 --> 04:33.840
Long live Baby Yoda.

04:33.840 --> 04:34.840
Yeah, exactly.

04:34.840 --> 04:40.160
But it was very much like a, I didn't, I knew it was possible, but I never thought they

04:40.160 --> 04:41.160
would do it.

04:41.160 --> 04:42.160
Okay.

04:42.160 --> 04:46.480
Have you, I think I would liken it to, have you ever seen a wrestling pay-per-view, perhaps

04:46.480 --> 04:47.480
when you were younger?

04:47.480 --> 04:48.480
Yes.

04:48.480 --> 04:53.020
Where all of a sudden you heard the music and you were like, oh shit, they did it!

04:53.020 --> 04:54.920
You hear the glass break and Stone Cold comes out.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.720
Exactly, and Stone Cold comes out and you're like, I didn't think it was going to be Stone

04:57.720 --> 04:59.640
Cold and it was him!

04:59.640 --> 05:02.520
It's like that, but if your childhood came back and kicked you in the dick.

05:02.520 --> 05:03.520
Okay.

05:03.520 --> 05:04.520
Well, it's fantastic.

05:04.520 --> 05:08.400
I have no idea what you're talking about and I'm glad you enjoyed it.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

05:09.480 --> 05:13.060
I'm sorry I didn't make anything.

05:13.060 --> 05:15.040
So technically I barely did.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.040
Yeah, that's fair.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.000
Today we've got an interesting episode to go over, Jordan.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.920
We're talking about Friday of last week, which would be the 18th of December, 2020.

05:21.920 --> 05:22.920
I'm Dan.

05:22.920 --> 05:23.920
This is 2020.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.960
Hey, that's good news!

05:25.960 --> 05:28.560
This is an interesting thing.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.560
It's a thing?

05:29.560 --> 05:30.560
Yes.

05:30.560 --> 05:31.560
All right.

05:31.560 --> 05:32.960
And we'll get into exactly why it's an interesting thing.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.220
I'm not saying an episode.

05:34.220 --> 05:36.900
Is that David Knight's music being played in the background?

05:36.900 --> 05:37.900
Glass breaks.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.440
As David Knight comes to- Oh shit!

05:40.440 --> 05:41.440
We're back!

05:41.440 --> 05:42.440
Oh my God!

05:42.440 --> 05:47.160
David Knight has parted the Red Sea!

05:47.160 --> 05:53.640
And now it's time to bring back my show where I will talk for three hours or so.

05:53.640 --> 06:00.480
No, that is, David Knight does not make an appearance, although we might learn a few

06:00.480 --> 06:01.480
things.

06:01.480 --> 06:05.240
I'm going to actually have a request for you taking notes throughout this episode that

06:05.240 --> 06:07.000
we'll get to here in a few.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.620
But before we do that, let's take a moment to say thank you to some folks who have signed

06:09.620 --> 06:10.620
up and are supporting the show.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.620

06:43.100 --> 06:44.100

06:44.100 --> 06:45.100

06:45.100 --> 06:46.100
No last initial at all?

06:46.100 --> 06:47.100
Mm-hmm.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.100
It was the first Adam?

06:48.100 --> 06:49.100
Yeah.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.100
Holy shit!

06:50.100 --> 06:51.100

06:55.100 --> 06:56.100

06:56.100 --> 06:57.100
And then finally, let's say thank you to a couple of people who donated on elevated

06:57.100 --> 06:58.380
love and we appreciate that very much.

06:58.380 --> 07:01.500
So first, Larry Klayman for Supreme Court, thank you so much.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.000
You are now a technocrat.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.620
And Mean Blackbird, thank you so much.

07:04.620 --> 07:06.140
You are now a technocrat.

07:06.140 --> 07:07.140
I'm a policy wonk.

07:07.140 --> 07:08.140
Crikey, mate.

07:08.140 --> 07:09.140
That's fantastic.

07:09.140 --> 07:10.140
Have yourself a brew.

07:10.140 --> 07:11.140
How's your 401k doing, bro?

07:11.140 --> 07:12.140
All right.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.140
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

07:14.140 --> 07:15.700
Let's just get down to business.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.760
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.700
Why are you pimps so good?

07:19.700 --> 07:21.340
My neck is freakishly large.

07:21.340 --> 07:24.100
I declare info war on you.

07:24.100 --> 07:27.100
Thank you so much, Larry Klayman for Supreme Court and thank you so much, Mean Blackbird.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.100
Yes.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.100
Thank you very much to the both of you.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.100
Yes.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.100
If you're out there listening and thinking, hey, I enjoy the show.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.100
I'd like support with these gents.

07:32.100 --> 07:35.980
You can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com, clicking the button to support the show

07:35.980 --> 07:36.980
or.

07:36.980 --> 07:41.060
Oh, what you could do is take a look at your little spaceship.

07:41.060 --> 07:46.860
You could hop in that little spaceship with the intent of solving many problems.

07:46.860 --> 07:52.180
And when you arrive at your destination, you can tear apart everyone in your path trying

07:52.180 --> 07:58.100
to keep you from expressing your generosity by going to a local bail fund or charity.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.060
Give your generosity to Grogu.

08:00.060 --> 08:01.060
Yes.

08:01.060 --> 08:05.180
Give your Grogu to a local charity in your area.

08:05.180 --> 08:09.700
I like the idea of you starting over watching The Mandalorian again, just staring at him,

08:09.700 --> 08:10.700
just going Grogu.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.700
You're fucking Grogu?

08:12.700 --> 08:14.300
You're Grogu?

08:14.300 --> 08:17.500
You can't experience it unless you don't know his name.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.500
Yeah.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.540
I don't pick I'll ever watch it.

08:20.540 --> 08:21.540
Yeah, I know.

08:21.540 --> 08:25.620
I'm interested in seeing Werner Herzog's delightful performance.

08:25.620 --> 08:26.620
It's fantastic.

08:26.620 --> 08:32.700
I'm excited about some of the screenshots I've seen of the child will be something incredible.

08:32.700 --> 08:33.700
Yeah.

08:33.700 --> 08:34.700
I would like to.

08:34.700 --> 08:35.700
And now I can't.

08:35.700 --> 08:36.700
Yeah.

08:36.700 --> 08:37.700
Grogu.

08:37.700 --> 08:38.700
Yeah.

08:38.700 --> 08:41.140
Unfortunately, his name is Grogu.

08:41.140 --> 08:44.740
Grogu has celebrated 50 birthdays, from what I understand.

08:44.740 --> 08:45.740
Is that correct?

08:45.740 --> 08:46.740
Yes, it is.

08:46.740 --> 08:48.140
Someone who's celebrating a birthday today.

08:48.140 --> 08:49.140
Nicely done.

08:49.140 --> 08:51.100
We'd like to give a shout out to Wendy.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.100
Happy birthday, Wendy.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.700
Happy birthday, Wendy.

08:53.700 --> 08:57.140
Wendy informed us that her last name was Grogu?

08:57.140 --> 08:58.140
No.

08:58.140 --> 09:01.300
Birthday on Monday, and it's the shortest day of the year.

09:01.300 --> 09:05.580
I know we had some dispute about day lengths a while back.

09:05.580 --> 09:07.460
Oh, it is the winter solstice.

09:07.460 --> 09:09.180
So happy solstice and happy birthday, Wendy.

09:09.180 --> 09:10.180
Yes, indeed.

09:10.180 --> 09:11.180
I hope you are a witch.

09:11.180 --> 09:12.660
Oh, boy.

09:12.660 --> 09:18.580
So Jordan, today, like I said, we got a thing to go over.

09:18.580 --> 09:21.580
And that is going to be a lot of Alex.

09:21.580 --> 09:24.300
Because Alex Jones did double duty on Friday.

09:24.300 --> 09:25.300
Of course.

09:25.300 --> 09:28.380
He hosted David Knight's show and then his own show.

09:28.380 --> 09:30.160
Oh, God.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.060
So here is an out of context drop from Alex.

09:33.060 --> 09:34.060
You understand?

09:34.060 --> 09:37.700
You've got to scare the living hell out of your kids.

09:37.700 --> 09:38.700
Okay.

09:38.700 --> 09:39.700
All right.

09:39.700 --> 09:40.700
Okay.

09:40.700 --> 09:41.700
Good parenting advice from Alex.

09:41.700 --> 09:42.700
No, that's good.

09:42.700 --> 09:43.700
That's good.

09:43.700 --> 09:44.700
Always got to appreciate that.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.200
That was, I believe, scarecrow's policy.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.300
Spare the scarecrow, spoil the child.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.740
Scare the child, don't spoil.

09:50.740 --> 09:52.300
I don't know how to do this.

09:52.300 --> 09:58.300
So Alex hosted his own broadcast, the Alex Jones show, trademark, copyright free, anyone

09:58.300 --> 09:59.300
can use it, whatever.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.300
Who cares?

10:00.300 --> 10:01.300
No problem.

10:01.300 --> 10:06.380
Before that, because he had fired David Knight the day before, he needed to fill that time.

10:06.380 --> 10:07.380
Sure.

10:07.380 --> 10:08.380
Something had to go there.

10:08.380 --> 10:13.260
And so what he decided to do was finally do that show that was mostly callers.

10:13.260 --> 10:14.260
Okay.

10:14.260 --> 10:17.900
So he's decided he's going to start a new show called The American Journal.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.740
Get the fuck out of here.

10:19.740 --> 10:21.840
The American Journal.

10:21.840 --> 10:22.900
It's a parody.

10:22.900 --> 10:23.900
I say it's a parody.

10:23.900 --> 10:28.540
He would say it's an homage to The Washington Journal on C-SPAN.

10:28.540 --> 10:34.380
And he says that about a hundred times throughout the three hour show.

10:34.380 --> 10:37.380
I don't think his audience would get the reference otherwise.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.140
He does really hammer it home.

10:39.140 --> 10:41.540
It's like a Washington Journal, but it's America.

10:41.540 --> 10:43.860
We've never seen C-SPAN.

10:43.860 --> 10:47.980
So here is an out of context drop from one of the callers on The American Journal.

10:47.980 --> 10:52.420
All these people that think that this COVID shot is going to cure them or even make them

10:52.420 --> 10:54.740
into a cyborg human being.

10:54.740 --> 10:55.740
They're wrong.

10:55.740 --> 10:56.740
It is not.

10:56.740 --> 10:57.740
It is going to kill them.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.740
Oh.

10:58.740 --> 11:00.840
Getting the pulse of America.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.860
That is The American Journal.

11:02.860 --> 11:06.460
I think that would be a fairly good chronicle of our times.

11:06.460 --> 11:07.460
Yeah.

11:07.460 --> 11:10.740
All these people out there who think the shot's going to turn them into a cyborg.

11:10.740 --> 11:11.740
They're wrong.

11:11.740 --> 11:12.740
Idiots.

11:12.740 --> 11:16.540
They're so goddamn stupid, they think they're going to turn into a cyborg.

11:16.540 --> 11:19.540
God, we're taking the time to hear these missives.

11:19.540 --> 11:25.180
We've got to debunk all of these falsehoods that are going around, Dan.

11:25.180 --> 11:26.980
So here's Alex starting off the Journal.

11:26.980 --> 11:28.740
And the Journal starts earlier.

11:28.740 --> 11:30.720
Alex is used to starting his show at 11.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.120
This one starts at 8.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.120
That's too early.

11:33.120 --> 11:36.240
Yeah, so he's in there early.

11:36.240 --> 11:40.960
You're listening to The American Journal with your host, Alex Jones.

11:40.960 --> 11:46.700
Watch it live right now at band.video.

11:46.700 --> 11:54.100
All right, folks, we are live on this Friday transmission.

11:54.100 --> 12:03.460
Thank you so much for joining us on this December 17th broadcast.

12:03.460 --> 12:04.460
So much going on.

12:04.460 --> 12:05.460
There's so much happening.

12:05.460 --> 12:06.460
I work seven days a week.

12:06.460 --> 12:09.140
I'm not even sure what day it is anymore.

12:09.140 --> 12:10.660
Makes my head spin.

12:10.660 --> 12:11.660
It's the 18th.

12:11.660 --> 12:12.660
Yeah.

12:12.660 --> 12:13.660
Yeah.

12:13.660 --> 12:14.660
It does.

12:14.660 --> 12:15.660
That's not an auspicious beginning.

12:15.660 --> 12:22.220
No, it does sound like he's already taking his time to run up the clock.

12:22.220 --> 12:23.220
Already stalling.

12:23.220 --> 12:26.140
Minute one of The American Journal.

12:26.140 --> 12:34.820
Ladies and gentlemen, we begin our...

12:34.820 --> 12:35.820
From a place.

12:35.820 --> 12:36.820
Show.

12:36.820 --> 12:38.900
In the middle of America.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.940
We're going to take calls.

12:40.940 --> 12:45.340
I'm going to say a million fucking times that this is like The Washington Journal, but I'm

12:45.340 --> 12:46.340
doing it.

12:46.340 --> 12:47.340
It's going to be a while.

12:47.340 --> 12:50.380
I'm going to complain a whole bunch.

12:50.380 --> 12:54.180
John Rappaport's going to host the last half hour because I got to take a break in between

12:54.180 --> 12:55.380
this and my show.

12:55.380 --> 12:56.380
Yeah.

12:56.380 --> 12:57.380
Six hours straight is a lot.

12:57.380 --> 13:01.480
The whole show's supposed to be about taking calls and the last half hour is John Rappaport

13:01.480 --> 13:02.480
not taking calls.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.480
Hey, come on.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.740
He's John Rappaport.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.000
He's not on his feet, man.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
It's ridiculous.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
No.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.420
So anyway, Alex realizes that it's the 18th.

13:10.420 --> 13:18.860
Now, I told the guys months ago, I had an idea, told the crew for something like a...

13:18.860 --> 13:20.460
Let's buy another tank.

13:20.460 --> 13:25.260
National Journal program based on The Washington Journal.

13:25.260 --> 13:26.260
And that's what we're doing right now.

13:26.260 --> 13:30.500
It is Friday, December 18th, 2020.

13:30.500 --> 13:34.540
I was looking up there on the computer board and it said December 17th, 2020.

13:34.540 --> 13:36.420
And I said, that's not right.

13:36.420 --> 13:40.860
It's Friday, December 18th, but of course, that's why you can't always trust computers,

13:40.860 --> 13:41.860
can you?

13:41.860 --> 13:43.060
Sometimes computers lie to you.

13:43.060 --> 13:44.540
You need to be aware of this.

13:44.540 --> 13:50.800
Wait, is The Washington Journal the one where it's the guy who is steadfast in his not having

13:50.800 --> 13:51.880
a facial expression?

13:51.880 --> 13:54.780
Like somebody calls in and they're like, I think dogs are going to own this world.

13:54.780 --> 13:56.420
And he's like, that was a good call.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.420
The next caller.

13:57.420 --> 14:00.420
And they have the Republican and Democrat independent lines.

14:00.420 --> 14:01.420
Yes, yes.

14:01.420 --> 14:02.420
That's the show.

14:02.420 --> 14:03.420
All right.

14:03.420 --> 14:10.060
Alex thinks he's capable of doing that and boy, I will tell you from round one, he is

14:10.060 --> 14:11.060
not.

14:11.060 --> 14:12.060
All right.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.980
So flappable he is, un he is not.

14:13.980 --> 14:19.660
I just, I mean like it would be like if The Washington Journal host constantly like forgot

14:19.660 --> 14:21.260
why he was there.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.540
That would, that's kind of the way you would make it meet.

14:23.540 --> 14:24.540
All right.

14:24.540 --> 14:25.540
I like it.

14:25.540 --> 14:26.540
But the aspiration is there.

14:26.540 --> 14:27.940
Much like me trying to make these egg rounds.

14:27.940 --> 14:28.940
Sure.

14:28.940 --> 14:31.940
Alex intends to take 90% calls.

14:31.940 --> 14:37.260
So here we are and I told the crew months ago that I wanted to launch a show either

14:37.260 --> 14:46.740
in the morning or at night and call it National Journal, kind of after The Washington Journal

14:46.740 --> 14:50.380
to really habituate myself or whoever the host would be, I thought of it kind of as

14:50.380 --> 14:55.540
a rotating group of hosts, to take a lot of phone calls and actually do it every day because

14:55.540 --> 15:00.620
the show is based at least 90% on phone calls.

15:00.620 --> 15:09.820
And so that is what we are doing here on this live Friday, December 18th, 2020 broadcast.

15:09.820 --> 15:15.420
I will give Alex some credit and say that it's more calls than you'd expect based on

15:15.420 --> 15:16.420
his history.

15:16.420 --> 15:17.420
Sure.

15:17.420 --> 15:18.420
It's still not 90%.

15:18.420 --> 15:19.420
Well.

15:19.420 --> 15:23.300
It's not, it's, and some of them are talking about how you're not going to turn into a

15:23.300 --> 15:24.300
cyborg.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.660
So then some of them you might as well not have.

15:26.660 --> 15:27.660
That's fair.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.420
And one of them is a guy named Mountain Patriot.

15:29.420 --> 15:30.420
Okay.

15:30.420 --> 15:31.420
Yeah.

15:31.420 --> 15:32.420
Was that his birth name?

15:32.420 --> 15:33.420
Yeah.

15:33.420 --> 15:34.420
Yeah.

15:34.420 --> 15:35.420
It's on his birth certificate.

15:35.420 --> 15:36.420
All right.

15:36.420 --> 15:37.420
Well, that's good.

15:37.420 --> 15:38.420
On his new birth certificate that he got when he became a sovereign.

15:38.420 --> 15:39.420
Yeah.

15:39.420 --> 15:40.420
Okay.

15:40.420 --> 15:41.420
Well, that's fair.

15:41.420 --> 15:42.420
So here's where I want to make a request of you taking notes.

15:42.420 --> 15:43.420
Sure.

15:43.420 --> 15:47.620
A large portion of this turns into Alex complaining about David Knight.

15:47.620 --> 15:54.940
There is a large part of this episode is like Alex being kind of too aware that people are

15:54.940 --> 15:57.420
going to tune in thinking it's David Knight's show.

15:57.420 --> 15:58.420
What happened?

15:58.420 --> 15:59.420
Yeah.

15:59.420 --> 16:02.060
So we have to kind of address the issue.

16:02.060 --> 16:08.380
Now on the 17th, the episode that we listened to on our last episode, we heard him give

16:08.380 --> 16:11.380
the explanation that it's money.

16:11.380 --> 16:12.380
It's money.

16:12.380 --> 16:13.380
Right.

16:13.380 --> 16:14.380
Right, right, right.

16:14.380 --> 16:15.380
We got financial troubles around here.

16:15.380 --> 16:16.380
Right.

16:16.380 --> 16:17.380
We have to scale back and get leaner.

16:17.380 --> 16:18.380
Yeah.

16:18.380 --> 16:19.460
So write that down at the top of your notes.

16:19.460 --> 16:26.100
So we're about to find out that it's actually about the number of emails David Knight sent?

16:26.100 --> 16:27.380
No, that doesn't come into it.

16:27.380 --> 16:28.380
Okay.

16:28.380 --> 16:29.380
All right.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.020
And maybe Steve Puchenik related.

16:31.020 --> 16:32.020
Sure.

16:32.020 --> 16:33.300
Because the two of them got into a bit of a beef.

16:33.300 --> 16:34.300
They got a tiff.

16:34.300 --> 16:38.300
Although also I'm a little reticent about that, or I had to been.

16:38.300 --> 16:39.300
Right.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.140
I want you to keep track of...

16:41.140 --> 16:43.100
How many different possible reasons there?

16:43.100 --> 16:44.100
Yes.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.100
Okay.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.100
I have to write down each new one.

16:46.100 --> 16:50.700
I want you to listen carefully and see how many different stories about why David got

16:50.700 --> 16:52.340
fired you could come up with.

16:52.340 --> 16:56.180
He did an upper decker in the toilet and I just can't do it anymore.

16:56.180 --> 16:57.340
I wish it was that interesting.

16:57.340 --> 16:58.340
Yeah, that would be fun.

16:58.340 --> 16:59.340
So here's the first one.

16:59.340 --> 17:00.820
I'm going to give you this as a layout.

17:00.820 --> 17:01.820
Okay.

17:01.820 --> 17:04.580
Now, a lot of you are probably tuning in and you're saying, where's David Knight?

17:04.580 --> 17:05.580
I love David Knight.

17:05.580 --> 17:06.580
I really care about him.

17:06.580 --> 17:07.820
He's a talented, smart guy.

17:07.820 --> 17:13.260
He's been with us nine years and I personally am exhausted doing my own show every day.

17:13.260 --> 17:19.300
And David, of course, took off quite a bit over a year ago with some medical issues and

17:19.300 --> 17:20.860
came back.

17:20.860 --> 17:29.340
And I just made the decision that David was not happy here.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.340
I made the decision.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.980
That it was not good for him to still be on air.

17:32.980 --> 17:34.700
That's my own personal decision.

17:34.700 --> 17:39.140
I was kind of watching him twist in the wind, very depressed with everything that's going

17:39.140 --> 17:40.980
on, very, very upset.

17:40.980 --> 17:43.980
And I agree with about 95% of what David has to say and what he does.

17:43.980 --> 17:47.460
I did not let David go because I disagreed with what he was doing or because he didn't

17:47.460 --> 17:50.060
agree with me on some things that had nothing to do with it.

17:50.060 --> 17:51.580
So that had nothing to do with it.

17:51.580 --> 17:56.860
It had everything to do with the fact that David Knight was unhappy by Alex's metric.

17:56.860 --> 18:00.980
Alex determined that David was unhappy, but he couldn't save himself.

18:00.980 --> 18:05.540
David Knight was too stubborn to leave the job when he was miserable.

18:05.540 --> 18:07.740
And so Alex did it for him, gave him the ax.

18:07.740 --> 18:08.980
Really, Alex is the good guy.

18:08.980 --> 18:11.020
Yeah, that doesn't sound right, but okay.

18:11.020 --> 18:14.540
Alex is your best friend that you think you don't need.

18:14.540 --> 18:20.100
I just don't think we're going to find out that this is a consistent storyline.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.700
I think I might have ruined that by setting up your note.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.260
Could be, could be.

18:25.260 --> 18:29.180
So one other possibility for why he might've gotten the ax is that Alex wanted to do this

18:29.180 --> 18:32.180
call-in show and David did not.

18:32.180 --> 18:40.540
I have wanted to launch, again, a program like Washington Journal, but National Journal.

18:40.540 --> 18:43.340
David was not interested in a program like that.

18:43.340 --> 18:46.860
We had, you know, first wanted to have a show that he would host that was, was calls and

18:46.860 --> 18:51.520
yes and things, but he had total control over a show and it went another direction.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.140
So here we are.

18:53.140 --> 18:57.340
And when I host the show or when Owen hosted or when Harrison hosted or when other people

18:57.340 --> 19:01.720
were looking at bringing in to host it, host it, if it's not a call-in show, then that

19:01.720 --> 19:04.300
person won't be hosting it anymore.

19:04.300 --> 19:09.360
So I've kind of gotten in a rut, not in a bad way, but it's a rut that I don't take

19:09.360 --> 19:10.620
enough calls.

19:10.620 --> 19:13.680
And I've gotten in a rut that I don't play enough clips and I've gotten in a rut that

19:13.680 --> 19:17.220
I tend to get on one story and pontificate on it for an hour.

19:17.220 --> 19:23.140
And that's somewhat informative for diehard listeners, but it's not for radio and TV stations

19:23.140 --> 19:28.820
to really cover some quick news, get into it, take calls, have a quick guest and really

19:28.820 --> 19:30.980
cycle through a lot of information.

19:30.980 --> 19:34.140
And so that's what this show is going to be.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.740
It's going to be your phone calls.

19:35.740 --> 19:40.580
I agree with Alex on some level that his show is inaccessible to people who aren't already

19:40.580 --> 19:41.580
indoctrinated.

19:41.580 --> 19:42.580
I do agree with that.

19:42.580 --> 19:43.580
Yes.

19:43.580 --> 19:47.300
The format that he has is not good for someone like clicking around on the radio.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.300
Right, right, right, right.

19:48.300 --> 19:52.460
It might be able to grab your attention with a guy yelling, but he doesn't yell all the

19:52.460 --> 19:53.460
time.

19:53.460 --> 19:54.460
Yeah.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.380
There's a lot of stretches of time that are completely boring, stupid shit.

19:57.380 --> 19:58.380
Sure.

19:58.380 --> 20:01.780
And you know, if you aren't already on the team, you're not going to give a shit about

20:01.780 --> 20:02.780
that.

20:02.780 --> 20:03.780
I mean, there's that.

20:03.780 --> 20:06.140
And also the mythology has just moved on so much from reality.

20:06.140 --> 20:07.140
Boy has it.

20:07.140 --> 20:13.340
Like, what are you, like, you're, you're coming in on like episode 40 of the 38th season.

20:13.340 --> 20:14.340
Yeah.

20:14.340 --> 20:16.180
You're not going to catch up with all that's happened before.

20:16.180 --> 20:19.900
I listen to this all the time and sometimes I lose track of the lore.

20:19.900 --> 20:20.900
Exactly.

20:20.900 --> 20:21.900
It's nonsense.

20:21.900 --> 20:22.900
Yes, exactly.

20:22.900 --> 20:23.900
Yeah.

20:23.900 --> 20:24.900
Yeah.

20:24.900 --> 20:29.420
I, yeah, it would be something that would be very, very difficult for you to get people

20:29.420 --> 20:30.420
in the door.

20:30.420 --> 20:31.420
Right.

20:31.420 --> 20:32.420
And I understand that.

20:32.420 --> 20:33.420
And I think our show probably is the same.

20:33.420 --> 20:34.420
Yeah.

20:34.420 --> 20:35.420
So I kind of empathize with Alex.

20:35.420 --> 20:36.420
Totally.

20:36.420 --> 20:40.580
And, um, you know, if he needs to switch up his format in order to maybe cater to an audience

20:40.580 --> 20:43.100
that he can trick into buying pills, great, good for him.

20:43.100 --> 20:44.940
I'm going to stick with what we got.

20:44.940 --> 20:50.000
I would, I would also say that David is smart for not wanting to do a call-in show just

20:50.000 --> 20:54.420
simply because you've also cultivated an audience that you don't want to hear what they have

20:54.420 --> 20:55.420
to say.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.420
It's true.

20:56.420 --> 20:57.420
It's true.

20:57.420 --> 20:59.780
You would, like, if you're David Knight and you try and pretend like you take this all

20:59.780 --> 21:03.780
very seriously and you're a, you're a, you're a thinker, you think Steve Pachenik's full

21:03.780 --> 21:04.780
of shit.

21:04.780 --> 21:05.780
So you clearly have some standards.

21:05.780 --> 21:07.740
You're trying to enforce something.

21:07.740 --> 21:11.560
You lose credibility by having to humor idiots.

21:11.560 --> 21:15.300
And David Knight's probably too polite to tell people to shut up.

21:15.300 --> 21:17.980
People who think they're going to be cyborgs are stupid.

21:17.980 --> 21:19.980
They're going to die.

21:19.980 --> 21:25.500
Um, oh, I, I mean, uh, uh, I am a cyborg.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.500
What?

21:26.500 --> 21:28.220
So, uh, you got a lot of calls coming up.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.220
Okay.

21:29.220 --> 21:31.820
And we're going to be taking a lot of your phone calls.

21:31.820 --> 21:36.100
So I'll give you the number when we come back.

21:36.100 --> 21:43.260
And part of taking phone calls is going to be, we are going to get to your call and move

21:43.260 --> 21:44.260
the next person.

21:44.260 --> 21:47.700
So I'm not going to do, thank you for calling and go, thank you so much, Alex.

21:47.700 --> 21:48.700
Oh.

21:48.700 --> 21:49.700
And then get into what you have to say.

21:49.700 --> 21:52.060
We're just going to, Hey, you're calling in.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.060
Here's the topic.

21:53.060 --> 21:57.020
We'll, we'll talk about a topic, an hour, another topic, the next hour.

21:57.020 --> 22:01.120
And that's how this is going to be something that I haven't really done personally in this

22:01.120 --> 22:02.420
style over 20 years.

22:02.420 --> 22:05.060
And so thank you for joining us for American journal.

22:05.060 --> 22:06.540
We'll be right back.

22:06.540 --> 22:07.940
Listen to this mellow ass music.

22:07.940 --> 22:08.940
Yeah.

22:08.940 --> 22:09.940
Yeah.

22:09.940 --> 22:10.940
This is very strange.

22:10.940 --> 22:11.940
This is real.

22:11.940 --> 22:12.940
Eight in the morning.

22:12.940 --> 22:13.940
Got out some coffee.

22:13.940 --> 22:19.500
This is dissonant to hear Alex like, Oh, I haven't been awake before nine and 20 years.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.180
It's surreal on a lot of levels.

22:22.180 --> 22:28.540
Uh, just sitting there with like a calm show.

22:28.540 --> 22:29.540
Yeah.

22:29.540 --> 22:30.540
Yeah.

22:30.540 --> 22:31.540
Just sitting there with a calm.

22:31.540 --> 22:32.540
That's very funny.

22:32.540 --> 22:36.140
So Alex starts off after he gets back from the commercial with introducing the first

22:36.140 --> 22:40.700
topic and the way he wants to do this is he wants to have an hour block and then it's

22:40.700 --> 22:43.140
so he has like, all right, we have our first topic.

22:43.140 --> 22:45.620
We're taking calls on that topic next hour.

22:45.620 --> 22:46.980
I'll introduce another topic.

22:46.980 --> 22:48.540
We'll take calls on that topic.

22:48.540 --> 22:49.540
Sure.

22:49.540 --> 22:50.540
And I got a framework.

22:50.540 --> 22:55.680
I'm not sure if it works out the way he wants it to, but here is the first topic.

22:55.680 --> 22:59.620
And she passes out and falls to ground had to be taken out later on a stretcher.

22:59.620 --> 23:01.380
So he's, he just, I forgot.

23:01.380 --> 23:07.260
He had played a clip, uh, from Tennessee of a nurse who was giving a, uh, little bit of

23:07.260 --> 23:12.780
a talk to reporters after getting the vaccine for COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine.

23:12.780 --> 23:16.100
And she, uh, fainted after, uh, while she was talking to reporters.

23:16.100 --> 23:17.100
Okay.

23:17.100 --> 23:18.100
Okay.

23:18.100 --> 23:19.360
And so Alex played the audio of that, but it was really bad.

23:19.360 --> 23:25.020
So I had to start this after, uh, the, uh, the auto is, it was just unlistenable.

23:25.020 --> 23:29.380
And she passes out and falls to the ground had to be taken out later on a stretcher.

23:29.380 --> 23:34.980
And they put out a press release on local ABC news saying, Oh, it's quite normal to

23:34.980 --> 23:38.040
collapse like this when you take any vaccine.

23:38.040 --> 23:41.380
So this video of the nurse in Tennessee was circulating on social media.

23:41.380 --> 23:44.340
And man, it has all of the optics you wouldn't want.

23:44.340 --> 23:48.540
If you're trying to reassure people about the safety of a COVID vaccine, but it's still

23:48.540 --> 23:52.920
something that's being used dishonestly nurse, Tiffany Dover was answering questions from

23:52.920 --> 23:54.460
reporters about getting the vaccine.

23:54.460 --> 23:58.360
At which point she said she was feeling dizzy and momentarily fainted.

23:58.360 --> 24:01.940
She later explained that she has a condition where she faints when she feels pain.

24:01.940 --> 24:05.060
And it was unlikely something caused by the vaccine.

24:05.060 --> 24:08.780
Alex is also just lying about the video and making up details about it.

24:08.780 --> 24:12.120
Most glaringly that she had to be carried out on a stretcher.

24:12.120 --> 24:16.180
According to the associated press quote, Dover was back on her feet shortly after passing

24:16.180 --> 24:17.180
out.

24:17.180 --> 24:21.100
As it turns out, this is just a reaction that some people have to any kind of shot.

24:21.100 --> 24:24.420
And most doctors believe that it's related to pain or anxiety.

24:24.420 --> 24:28.040
You could easily see someone with a history of fainting when experiencing pain, having

24:28.040 --> 24:32.340
that amplified by the anxiety of being on news, getting one of the first vaccines for

24:32.340 --> 24:36.180
a pandemic that should fucking up everyone's life for about a year.

24:36.180 --> 24:40.660
But I do grant that the optics are not what you'd want here at all.

24:40.660 --> 24:44.160
If you're just someone who doesn't care about details and go off emotional reactions to

24:44.160 --> 24:48.500
surface level appearances, then this would be very powerful in terms of painting the

24:48.500 --> 24:52.740
vaccine as dangerous, which I guess is the first topic for the American Journal.

24:52.740 --> 24:58.140
Yeah, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna say that it wouldn't be a smarter idea not to have

24:58.140 --> 25:03.460
a Southern belle from the 1870s take the first vaccine.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.820
Oh my God, this vaccine.

25:05.820 --> 25:12.300
But I will say that when I got the hepatitis vaccine before I went to South Africa with

25:12.300 --> 25:14.820
my partner, I passed out.

25:14.820 --> 25:19.120
Like I was sitting on the chair and I had to go down on the ground and lay on the floor

25:19.120 --> 25:21.700
because it was such a huge vaccine too.

25:21.700 --> 25:23.460
So it was a, yeah, yeah.

25:23.460 --> 25:25.700
I've not had that experience, but I've definitely seen it.

25:25.700 --> 25:30.100
And I know that some people like when they give blood, they can have a chance of passing

25:30.100 --> 25:37.980
out or, or even like when you see people giving blood or whatever the shock of, of that some,

25:37.980 --> 25:43.420
some people get a lot of response to it and it has nothing to do with what's in the syringe

25:43.420 --> 25:44.420
usually.

25:44.420 --> 25:47.220
So anyway, but there's more to be worried about with this vaccine.

25:47.220 --> 25:50.080
I guess this is also what Alex wants to talk about.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.900
You know, it says on the inserts that it can kill you.

25:52.900 --> 25:54.220
This is not a normal vaccine.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.220
It's even worse.

25:55.220 --> 26:00.780
It's an M RNA vaccine that actually goes in and reprograms every major cell group in your

26:00.780 --> 26:04.300
body to produce quote proteins that block the virus.

26:04.300 --> 26:07.420
Those same proteins happen to be in the placenta.

26:07.420 --> 26:12.660
And so it also blocks having a baby and they had sure, sure toss that in children for a

26:12.660 --> 26:13.660
couple of years.

26:13.660 --> 26:19.140
When you take some of the M RNA vaccines actually have the medical reports from big pharma and

26:19.140 --> 26:21.180
the trials here in my stack today.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.860
Yes, this isn't a conspiracy theory.

26:23.860 --> 26:25.040
This is a fact.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.620
So what Alex is talking about there is complete nonsense.

26:28.620 --> 26:33.620
He was recently yelling about the six deaths in the Pfizer trials, which we discussed on

26:33.620 --> 26:37.980
a recent episode and four were in the placebo group and two were most likely not caused

26:37.980 --> 26:38.980
by the vaccine.

26:38.980 --> 26:42.160
Totally that breakdown that they released, which included that information is probably

26:42.160 --> 26:45.380
one of the best resources for information about the effects that have been documented

26:45.380 --> 26:46.980
in persons who have been given the vaccine.

26:46.980 --> 26:51.700
And Alex says that he has this in his stack, he references this material.

26:51.700 --> 26:55.820
In that very document, they say that quote at the time of the data cut off, which was

26:55.820 --> 27:03.660
November 14th, 2020, a total of 23 participants had reported pregnancies in the safety database,

27:03.660 --> 27:07.900
including nine participants who withdrew from the study due to pregnancies.

27:07.900 --> 27:11.860
There's demographic information about the 43,000 people who were enrolled in the study.

27:11.860 --> 27:16.700
And I considered trying to whittle it down to see if 23 was a notably high or low number

27:16.700 --> 27:18.540
of pregnancies to see in that size group.

27:18.540 --> 27:22.600
But honestly, it would have been impossible to tell from the given information.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.940
You can make some general assumptions, but even if you're able to get a vague number

27:25.940 --> 27:29.740
of the population in the study who are able to get pregnant and of a likely age where

27:29.740 --> 27:32.260
they might, that still doesn't really help.

27:32.260 --> 27:35.820
You still have no idea how many of these people are sexually active, how many were using birth

27:35.820 --> 27:37.460
control, et cetera.

27:37.460 --> 27:41.980
Without access to any of that data, it seems to me that 23 pregnancies is a fairly normal

27:41.980 --> 27:42.980
number.

27:42.980 --> 27:45.180
And it also contradicts all of Alex's bullshit.

27:45.180 --> 27:47.620
Aren't you sick of all these fact checkers, Dan?

27:47.620 --> 27:48.620
I hate them.

27:48.620 --> 27:53.300
A more important piece of info we can take from that Pfizer report is from table 23 towards

27:53.300 --> 27:58.160
the end of the report, which details serious adverse events experienced in the study.

27:58.160 --> 28:03.140
There was one spontaneous abortion that occurred in that group of 43,000 participants, which

28:03.140 --> 28:07.860
was the only pregnancy or perinatal complication or condition that was reported.

28:07.860 --> 28:11.580
This was someone in the placebo group, so it was not caused by the vaccine.

28:11.580 --> 28:12.580
Okay.

28:12.580 --> 28:13.580
All right.

28:13.580 --> 28:17.020
This is a meme that Alex has seen that suggests that the vaccine will cause infertility, but

28:17.020 --> 28:18.300
it's a load of shit.

28:18.300 --> 28:23.420
The basic idea is that the spike protein used in the vaccine is the same as the protein

28:23.420 --> 28:27.480
that's used by the body to create a placenta, so the vaccine would train your body to attack

28:27.480 --> 28:30.580
the very thing you'd need to develop in order to become pregnant.

28:30.580 --> 28:36.620
The protein is called syncytin-1, but the problem boils down to an elementary misunderstanding

28:36.620 --> 28:39.020
on the part of these viral meme makers.

28:39.020 --> 28:44.580
The vaccine uses a spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which does share a small sequence of amino

28:44.580 --> 28:50.900
acid with syncytin-1, but it's not close enough at all in similarity to cause the kind of

28:50.900 --> 28:52.220
reaction that Alex is suggesting.

28:52.220 --> 28:53.220
Sure.

28:53.220 --> 28:56.700
This is just flimsy meme-based nonsense that Alex is passing off as research, and it means

28:56.700 --> 28:57.700
nothing.

28:57.700 --> 28:58.700
Yeah.

28:58.700 --> 28:59.700
Also, we have not yet to get to any calls.

28:59.700 --> 29:04.020
Yeah, it's one of those, you know, it's one of those things where it's like, you guys

29:04.020 --> 29:06.340
can't know about science for now.

29:06.340 --> 29:08.700
You're just not ready to know a little bit about science.

29:08.700 --> 29:09.700
You're going to hurt yourselves.

29:09.700 --> 29:11.900
Yeah, a little bit is worse than none.

29:11.900 --> 29:12.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:12.900 --> 29:15.220
You guys just got to hold off on science.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.220
We'll get to you.

29:16.220 --> 29:18.220
You're going to learn it someday, I promise, but for now-

29:18.220 --> 29:20.740
Yeah, just say it's like devil magic in the syringe.

29:20.740 --> 29:21.740
Yes, please.

29:21.740 --> 29:22.820
Please just, yeah, yeah.

29:22.820 --> 29:23.820
This is no good.

29:23.820 --> 29:24.820
Yeah.

29:24.820 --> 29:29.220
So, he's going to open the phones next segment, but he has some questions.

29:29.220 --> 29:30.740
These are leading questions.

29:30.740 --> 29:31.740
Okay.

29:31.740 --> 29:38.520
Well, I want to open the phones up next segment, and I want to ask all the listeners and all

29:38.520 --> 29:49.300
of the viewers at 877-789-2539 and all the radio listeners at 877-789-2539 or 877-789-Alex,

29:49.300 --> 29:53.540
I want to ask you, are you planning to take the vaccine?

29:53.540 --> 29:56.460
If you're not, what are you going to do when they try to pressure you and push it on you

29:56.460 --> 30:00.540
or try to say it's mandatory as we're doing in some foreign countries and now pushing

30:00.540 --> 30:01.540
here?

30:01.540 --> 30:05.340
And then what do you make of the vaccine makers having liability protection so that when and

30:05.340 --> 30:10.620
if they hurt you, they don't get in any trouble?

30:10.620 --> 30:13.780
I love the idea that his first question is, are you going to take the vaccine?

30:13.780 --> 30:15.820
Obviously the answer from everybody is, fuck no.

30:15.820 --> 30:16.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:16.820 --> 30:20.220
Second question, what are you going to do when they force you to like, oh, let's swim

30:20.220 --> 30:23.900
around in violence fantasies about justified violence.

30:23.900 --> 30:27.660
And then the third question is something that none of them are equipped to have, a conversation

30:27.660 --> 30:32.980
about why companies have liability protection and what it means.

30:32.980 --> 30:36.260
That's something that no one who's calling into his show or Alex himself is prepared

30:36.260 --> 30:37.260
to have.

30:37.260 --> 30:42.660
I mean, I suppose one more question would be like, how would it feel to be immune to

30:42.660 --> 30:43.660
a disease?

30:43.660 --> 30:44.660
Does that sound exciting?

30:44.660 --> 30:46.660
Does anybody feel excited about that?

30:46.660 --> 30:48.820
Is that a Stan Lee superpower?

30:48.820 --> 30:51.620
Watch this, you can't be hurt by this disease.

30:51.620 --> 30:54.660
And it's cause real stuff, not cause your mind palace or whatever it is.

30:54.660 --> 30:55.660
It's cause of magic.

30:55.660 --> 30:56.660
Yeah.

30:56.660 --> 31:04.180
Um, Alex does not go to calls yet because he realizes that like, ah, David Knight's

31:04.180 --> 31:05.180
not here.

31:05.180 --> 31:06.180
Right.

31:06.180 --> 31:07.180
I'm doing his job.

31:07.180 --> 31:08.180
He's still got more shit talk to do.

31:08.180 --> 31:09.180
Yeah.

31:09.180 --> 31:11.300
If you tuned in, you're wondering where the David Knight show is.

31:11.300 --> 31:14.500
David's done a great job for nine years here.

31:14.500 --> 31:17.060
And uh, David deserves a break.

31:17.060 --> 31:18.820
We really appreciate David Knight.

31:18.820 --> 31:23.180
And so I made the decision to go ahead and for now cancel that show.

31:23.180 --> 31:24.180
He wants to do it on his own.

31:24.180 --> 31:25.180
That's wonderful.

31:25.180 --> 31:27.740
Maybe someday he'll do something here where it's once a week or something.

31:27.740 --> 31:31.180
Uh, I just think that, uh, I'm burnout and don't want this job.

31:31.180 --> 31:36.860
It's very exhausting, but I have a mission and, and David, um, let's just say David doesn't

31:36.860 --> 31:37.860
give a fuck front lines.

31:37.860 --> 31:40.580
If I think that it's a bad thing, I'm gonna leave it at that.

31:40.580 --> 31:44.180
Uh, but to David, you know, has, as a trooper, he's to take care of himself.

31:44.180 --> 31:45.180
Yeah.

31:45.180 --> 31:46.180
So David Knight's not committed.

31:46.180 --> 31:50.500
Apparently he doesn't have a mission like Alex does.

31:50.500 --> 31:55.100
I'm not going to keep a guy on the front lines if he's not, uh, let's leave it at

31:55.100 --> 31:56.100
that.

31:56.100 --> 31:57.100
Okay.

31:57.100 --> 31:58.100
Wait.

31:58.100 --> 31:59.900
So now it's because he's not performance related to the cause.

31:59.900 --> 32:06.260
I mean, it must be, whether it's like a will or ability, he's not somebody you have on

32:06.260 --> 32:07.260
the front line.

32:07.260 --> 32:08.260
He's not on the team.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.820
That's not just a, you being a nice guy.

32:10.820 --> 32:11.940
He's not happy here.

32:11.940 --> 32:17.060
No, that's a, that's a whole nother explanation and it turns out Alex, there might've been

32:17.060 --> 32:18.060
other influences.

32:18.060 --> 32:19.060
Sure.

32:19.060 --> 32:20.060
And that's it.

32:20.060 --> 32:21.060
There's no controversy.

32:21.060 --> 32:22.140
There's no, there's no secret reason.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.340
It's not because he was bashing Trump every day.

32:24.340 --> 32:27.540
I'm very frustrated with Trump that has nothing to do with it.

32:27.540 --> 32:31.900
It has to do with, I just thinking about it, praying about it, having dreams about David,

32:31.900 --> 32:33.380
really been worried about him.

32:33.380 --> 32:37.020
And I was worried about him last time he had that big heart attack and almost died.

32:37.020 --> 32:40.780
So I just, it's just, I just, I just said, Hey, that's that.

32:40.780 --> 32:42.100
So we pray for David.

32:42.100 --> 32:43.100
He's a great guy.

32:43.100 --> 32:45.220
He's doing great, but, uh, that's it.

32:45.220 --> 32:46.220
All right.

32:46.220 --> 32:47.480
We'll be right back.

32:47.480 --> 32:48.480
So you had a dream.

32:48.480 --> 32:52.040
Uh, I had a fuck dream about David Knight.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.040
So he's gone.

32:53.040 --> 32:57.980
I thought the last straw was Alex learning that black lives matter made $10 billion.

32:57.980 --> 33:02.860
No, it turns out this time, uh, it is, uh, because if you bash Trump every day and now

33:02.860 --> 33:04.960
it's not about that, I'm mad at Trump too.

33:04.960 --> 33:08.020
But if you bash Trump every day, you're not committed to the cause and you're fired.

33:08.020 --> 33:09.820
That's an explanation that he didn't give.

33:09.820 --> 33:10.820
That's an explanation.

33:10.820 --> 33:14.020
You just put it under the pachannic section because it's like what you would think based

33:14.020 --> 33:15.020
on what he's saying.

33:15.020 --> 33:16.020
Yeah.

33:16.020 --> 33:19.720
But there's another explanation buried in there and I'm trying to save his life.

33:19.720 --> 33:21.740
He's going to die if he keeps this up.

33:21.740 --> 33:22.740
All right guys.

33:22.740 --> 33:24.340
I thought he wasn't committed.

33:24.340 --> 33:25.340
I don't know.

33:25.340 --> 33:26.340
I don't know.

33:26.340 --> 33:27.340
I don't know.

33:27.340 --> 33:28.840
I hope he does his show by his self.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.460
You would sue him.

33:31.460 --> 33:32.760
You know you would sue him.

33:32.760 --> 33:33.760
There's a decent chance.

33:33.760 --> 33:34.760
Yeah.

33:34.760 --> 33:38.060
So, uh, Alex has something he's got to deal with, uh, before he gets to calls and that

33:38.060 --> 33:40.980
is that, uh, Mike Pence got a shot.

33:40.980 --> 33:41.980
Yeah.

33:41.980 --> 33:42.980
Um, and Alex shouldn't.

33:42.980 --> 33:44.540
Is he a cyborg or is he dead?

33:44.540 --> 33:52.540
Well, I mean, he's an enemy according to, you know, recent Info Wars lore, but, uh,

33:52.540 --> 33:56.180
still, still would be troubling if Mike Pence got this shot that Alex is saying is going

33:56.180 --> 33:57.180
to kill everyone.

33:57.180 --> 33:58.180
Okay.

33:58.180 --> 34:02.700
This is footage of the vice president just 30 minutes ago or so right before he went

34:02.700 --> 34:10.820
live on air, taking the supposed vaccine, and I got to tell you, they've caught world

34:10.820 --> 34:16.340
leaders in Germany, Japan, other areas, claiming they're taking the shot and then not taking

34:16.340 --> 34:17.340
it.

34:17.340 --> 34:19.260
So he's just going to imply that it's a fake shot.

34:19.260 --> 34:20.260
That works.

34:20.260 --> 34:24.060
I mean, I honestly, I think it's reasonable to just go with.

34:24.060 --> 34:26.260
They get the rich guy shot, right?

34:26.260 --> 34:29.860
It's more you're looking for a theory and you can just make anything up, then why not

34:29.860 --> 34:30.860
do that?

34:30.860 --> 34:35.540
It's more reasonable to think that the wealthy are getting better and different care now

34:35.540 --> 34:38.060
than it is to think they are taking the same shot.

34:38.060 --> 34:39.060
I don't think that.

34:39.060 --> 34:43.420
I think they're taking the same shot, but it's fucking reasonable to be like, Oh, they're

34:43.420 --> 34:46.900
getting rich guy medicine while we get the medium kind.

34:46.900 --> 34:50.540
And Alex has a tradition of talking about clean vaccine.

34:50.540 --> 34:51.660
Yeah, exactly.

34:51.660 --> 34:52.660
So why not?

34:52.660 --> 34:53.660
Yeah.

34:53.660 --> 34:54.660
I don't know.

34:54.660 --> 34:59.700
And he's already said that the mRNA vaccine is better than the older type of vaccine.

34:59.700 --> 35:00.700
No.

35:00.700 --> 35:01.700
Or is it the inverse?

35:01.700 --> 35:04.820
Alex has said, although he dropped this narrative really quick when he realized he didn't know

35:04.820 --> 35:05.820
what he was talking about.

35:05.820 --> 35:06.820
Yeah.

35:06.820 --> 35:11.580
He said that Trump was putting out the Pfizer vaccine in order to cut Gates off at the pass.

35:11.580 --> 35:12.580
Oh, that's right.

35:12.580 --> 35:15.580
Because Alex didn't realize that the Pfizer vaccine was an mRNA vaccine.

35:15.580 --> 35:16.580
Right, right, right, right.

35:16.580 --> 35:18.780
And he was saying that Gates wanted to do this evil one.

35:18.780 --> 35:21.500
So Trump was putting this out in order to put it in checkmate.

35:21.500 --> 35:26.420
That's why I got it mixed up because they're both mRNA, but yeah, now I got it.

35:26.420 --> 35:27.420
He's just dumb.

35:27.420 --> 35:28.420
Yeah.

35:28.420 --> 35:29.420
Yeah.

35:29.420 --> 35:30.420
And that's why that narrative is no longer in play.

35:30.420 --> 35:32.780
Alex realized, Oh, I should probably pretend I didn't say that.

35:32.780 --> 35:33.780
Yes.

35:33.780 --> 35:34.780
It would be smarter.

35:34.780 --> 35:35.780
Yeah.

35:35.780 --> 35:36.780
So Alex finally gets to calls.

35:36.780 --> 35:41.220
It's probably about, I would say 20 minutes in given like a commercial breaks, maybe even

35:41.220 --> 35:42.220
a little longer.

35:42.220 --> 35:45.500
And man, it doesn't start great.

35:45.500 --> 35:50.500
Washington journal, like Washington journal, but American journal, a lot of calls.

35:50.500 --> 35:54.260
Lily in California, you're on the air on the COVID vaccine.

35:54.260 --> 35:55.620
Where do you stand on this?

35:55.620 --> 35:57.820
Oh, absolutely not.

35:57.820 --> 35:58.980
It's the mark of the beast.

35:58.980 --> 35:59.980
No way.

35:59.980 --> 36:00.980
What a shock.

36:00.980 --> 36:01.980
Sure.

36:01.980 --> 36:02.980
What a shock.

36:02.980 --> 36:03.980
Taking America's temperature.

36:03.980 --> 36:10.060
Just all these calls are just going to sound like screech to me.

36:10.060 --> 36:11.060
That's it.

36:11.060 --> 36:12.060
A lot of them.

36:12.060 --> 36:13.060
Yeah.

36:13.060 --> 36:14.060
Yeah.

36:14.060 --> 36:15.060
There's nothing, there's no substance.

36:15.060 --> 36:16.060
Yeah.

36:16.060 --> 36:19.500
There's also going to be a break in that screeching though, uh, for plugs.

36:19.500 --> 36:20.500
Of course.

36:20.500 --> 36:23.180
But there's a second thing I wanted to mention very quickly.

36:23.180 --> 36:28.180
It's like, I want fellow listeners to know about the opportunity to support the info

36:28.180 --> 36:33.460
wars, not only with products, but that there's a support us on tap.

36:33.460 --> 36:37.340
It's hard to find it's that you make it very hard to do it.

36:37.340 --> 36:43.820
Um, but like two weeks ago, I just spent $50 I've, I've purchased lots of, of your products.

36:43.820 --> 36:48.180
Um, the water filter and, uh, and the various supplements.

36:48.180 --> 36:51.380
But right now, especially given everything that you're doing, I just want to put the

36:51.380 --> 36:52.380
money in your hand.

36:52.380 --> 36:56.660
I don't know how much I would have to spend to get for you to have $50 of profit.

36:56.660 --> 36:59.060
I, I, I'm blown away.

36:59.060 --> 37:02.780
The first caller just plugging, giving him money.

37:02.780 --> 37:03.780
Yep.

37:03.780 --> 37:04.780
Yep.

37:04.780 --> 37:05.780
Not, not, uh, not screening calls.

37:05.780 --> 37:06.780
Of course.

37:06.780 --> 37:07.780
It's amazing.

37:07.780 --> 37:08.780
That is Alex.

37:08.780 --> 37:11.660
I want to take a little bit of time out on your show and plug the people could just give

37:11.660 --> 37:14.180
you money without, without pills.

37:14.180 --> 37:15.180
Can't believe that.

37:15.180 --> 37:20.340
Uh, very shortly after announcing that you have to fire David Knight because of money

37:20.340 --> 37:24.180
reasons, people are calling in saying, uh, you know, and they're definitely not planted

37:24.180 --> 37:25.180
at all.

37:25.180 --> 37:26.180
That would be crazy.

37:26.180 --> 37:29.280
So she goes, Lily, Lily leaves and then we get the second caller.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.280
This is mountain Patriot.

37:30.280 --> 37:31.280
Sure.

37:31.280 --> 37:36.260
Let's go ahead and talk to mountain Patriot in Colorado.

37:36.260 --> 37:37.260
Thank you for holding.

37:37.260 --> 37:38.260
Screech.

37:38.260 --> 37:39.260
How you doing Alex?

37:39.260 --> 37:41.260
Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.

37:41.260 --> 37:42.260
We're in such a critical time.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.260
Brother.

37:43.260 --> 37:44.260
How are you?

37:44.260 --> 37:45.260
I love you, man.

37:45.260 --> 37:47.460
I'm going to miss David Knight, but totally understood.

37:47.460 --> 37:49.500
Uh, we are at war.

37:49.500 --> 37:57.300
I want to make a quick plug that DNA force, what are we doing?

37:57.300 --> 38:00.380
It gets really annoying, really fast possible.

38:00.380 --> 38:05.300
It almost feels like it can't be, you know, it is, it is not necessarily planted calls

38:05.300 --> 38:06.300
or not.

38:06.300 --> 38:07.300
I do.

38:07.300 --> 38:11.060
I do believe that there is a possibility of just people hearing this happen over and

38:11.060 --> 38:12.060
over again.

38:12.060 --> 38:16.820
You get trained that like, Oh, the way a call goes with Alex is you plug a product and then

38:16.820 --> 38:17.820
then you talk.

38:17.820 --> 38:18.820
Right.

38:18.820 --> 38:19.820
Right.

38:19.820 --> 38:20.820
Right.

38:20.820 --> 38:21.820
Right.

38:21.820 --> 38:22.820
Okay.

38:22.820 --> 38:23.820
This feels a little bit like, I'm sure you haven't seen it, but there's a movie called

38:23.820 --> 38:26.620
Phantom thread, uh, starring what's his name.

38:26.620 --> 38:27.700
Who's really good at acting.

38:27.700 --> 38:34.780
I've heard the name of that movie before and uh, uh, spoilers, uh, essentially he's, he's

38:34.780 --> 38:40.380
like part of their sex life is she regularly poisons him and takes care of him.

38:40.380 --> 38:42.180
That's kind of a weird thing that they do.

38:42.180 --> 38:44.380
So he just likes getting poisoned.

38:44.380 --> 38:45.380
Sure.

38:45.380 --> 38:50.140
So I feel like what I'm hearing from all of these people is like, I love getting poisoned

38:50.140 --> 38:51.540
by your products.

38:51.540 --> 38:52.780
That's just what I do.

38:52.780 --> 38:54.420
I want to send you $50.

38:54.420 --> 38:58.460
I like to trick myself into thinking that your pills do something for me.

38:58.460 --> 39:04.240
Yeah, you're taking care of me, but because of munch houses, I guess I'm forcing myself

39:04.240 --> 39:05.240
to get sick.

39:05.240 --> 39:09.140
And this conversation that we're having is actually really interesting because it actually

39:09.140 --> 39:12.820
kind of touches on something that really scared me about mountain Patriot.

39:12.820 --> 39:13.820
Okay.

39:13.820 --> 39:17.980
I want to talk about something called the placebo effect that I haven't heard anyone

39:17.980 --> 39:22.220
mentioned in nine months since this all broke out.

39:22.220 --> 39:25.180
We've been inside for these medicines.

39:25.180 --> 39:32.260
They have to do a double blind study that is they have to do a double blind study in

39:32.260 --> 39:38.700
order to eliminate the placebo effect, which is your own natural innate ability to heal.

39:38.700 --> 39:44.780
So let's calm it, perfect metaphor, calm it, how they want to take our power away.

39:44.780 --> 39:45.780
Don't do that.

39:45.780 --> 39:46.780
Terrifying.

39:46.780 --> 39:48.540
The placebo effect is how we're magic.

39:48.540 --> 39:49.540
Yeah.

39:49.540 --> 39:50.540
Yeah.

39:50.540 --> 39:52.640
This caller legitimately thinks the placebo effect is a term that's used to describe your

39:52.640 --> 39:55.260
body's natural ability to heal itself.

39:55.260 --> 39:58.320
Doctors only use double blind studies because they have to get rid of the possibility that

39:58.320 --> 40:02.920
you're just going to psychically heal yourself when you think you're getting medicine, right?

40:02.920 --> 40:05.940
First of all, the caller is talking about a single blind study.

40:05.940 --> 40:09.300
That's when a participant doesn't know whether they're getting a medicine or the placebo.

40:09.300 --> 40:13.300
A double blind study is when the people administering the trial also don't know which participants

40:13.300 --> 40:15.580
are getting the real thing or the placebo.

40:15.580 --> 40:19.020
This is to remove any possible bias that could come from the researchers expecting certain

40:19.020 --> 40:23.360
outcomes and treating participants differently depending on which group they're in.

40:23.360 --> 40:28.340
Double blind studies are more relevant for eliminating what's known as observer bias.

40:28.340 --> 40:33.660
Placebo effect generally both help with it, but secondly, the placebo effect does not

40:33.660 --> 40:35.440
describe actual healing.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.300
It's a phenomenon in the brain.

40:37.300 --> 40:41.260
For instance, if you're told that you're being given a pill to treat anxiety, but it's actually

40:41.260 --> 40:46.340
a placebo, the fact that you think that you're being given a pill that treats anxiety can

40:46.340 --> 40:48.340
have the effect of decreasing your anxiety.

40:48.340 --> 40:49.340
Totally.

40:49.340 --> 40:52.800
This is a very interesting and complicated thing, but it doesn't work like magic.

40:52.800 --> 40:56.380
If you have an infection and you're given a placebo, it will not treat that infection.

40:56.380 --> 40:57.380
No, I'm pretty sure it will.

40:57.380 --> 41:02.060
You may experience some pain relief or something like that, but you will still have that infection

41:02.060 --> 41:05.540
because the placebo is not treating the condition at all.

41:05.540 --> 41:06.540
No, no, no.

41:06.540 --> 41:11.580
If you break your leg and they give you a fake pill that heals legs, your leg will heal

41:11.580 --> 41:13.180
naturally if you believe in it.

41:13.180 --> 41:14.180
Sure.

41:14.180 --> 41:17.940
A good way to understand this difference is by looking at a 2011 study from Harvard Medical

41:17.940 --> 41:21.560
School and DeCote College and the University of Hull.

41:21.560 --> 41:25.700
Researchers there were looking to better understand the dynamics of placebo effect and symptom

41:25.700 --> 41:31.060
relief, so they designed a study where persons with asthma were given real and placebo inhalers

41:31.060 --> 41:34.180
as well as no treatment and also sham acupuncture.

41:34.180 --> 41:35.180
Gotcha.

41:35.180 --> 41:38.820
The study found that patients with placebo inhalers and even the fake acupuncturism...

41:38.820 --> 41:41.020
Wait, was it specifically sham acupuncture?

41:41.020 --> 41:42.020
Yeah, yeah.

41:42.020 --> 41:43.020
They didn't give...

41:43.020 --> 41:44.420
Real acupuncture might work?

41:44.420 --> 41:45.420
Just in case.

41:45.420 --> 41:46.420
It's just to eliminate another possible...

41:46.420 --> 41:47.420
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

41:47.420 --> 41:48.420
No, no, no.

41:48.420 --> 41:49.420
I gotcha.

41:49.420 --> 41:50.420
I gotcha.

41:50.420 --> 41:51.420
I'm sorry for interrupting it.

41:51.420 --> 41:52.420
Yeah.

41:52.420 --> 41:53.420
It seemed really...

41:53.420 --> 41:54.420
It is weird.

41:54.420 --> 41:55.420
Yeah.

41:55.420 --> 41:58.040
So the people with the placebo inhalers and even the fake acupuncture groups subjectively

41:58.040 --> 42:01.900
reported feeling better, and they felt like their symptoms were improving.

42:01.900 --> 42:05.620
However, both of these groups that got the false treatments showed no improvement in

42:05.620 --> 42:07.940
terms of actual lung function.

42:07.940 --> 42:11.980
The actual asthma was not affected at all by the fake treatments, but some of the symptoms

42:11.980 --> 42:14.060
of asthma could be alleviated.

42:14.060 --> 42:15.060
Sure.

42:15.060 --> 42:18.880
This was not true of the group that got the medicine, in this case albuterol.

42:18.880 --> 42:21.900
Those people actually did have greater lung function.

42:21.900 --> 42:24.680
It's great that through the experience of getting treatment, people can experience a

42:24.680 --> 42:29.040
beneficial result, but it should not be mistaken for actual treatment.

42:29.040 --> 42:33.260
If the people who got fake inhalers were then forced to perform a task that required lung

42:33.260 --> 42:37.880
exertion, they would be at a higher risk than the people who got the albuterol.

42:37.880 --> 42:41.580
This is the placebo effect that blind studies hope to minimize so they can test how effective

42:41.580 --> 42:45.500
an actual medication is, and what kind of side effects it could have independent of

42:45.500 --> 42:47.900
a person's expectations.

42:47.900 --> 42:51.700
There's another kind of placebo effect, which is basically Alex's business model.

42:51.700 --> 42:54.940
This is where you convince people they have a fake ailment, then you give them a placebo

42:54.940 --> 42:56.380
to cure it.

42:56.380 --> 43:00.440
His pills won't really do anything, but if he convinces you that your brain just won't

43:00.440 --> 43:05.180
work without his iodine, then you take his iodine and your brain works fine, you'll attribute

43:05.180 --> 43:07.340
that to his iodine.

43:07.340 --> 43:10.780
Iodine efficiency is a real condition, but pretty much everyone listening to Alex's show

43:10.780 --> 43:12.300
doesn't have it.

43:12.300 --> 43:17.180
But making you think that you might, eh, it's a super profitable thing when you sell iodine

43:17.180 --> 43:18.820
and you can manipulate that placebo effect.

43:18.820 --> 43:24.020
Yeah, I think the only thing that we can confirm his products to, or at least points heavily

43:24.020 --> 43:26.540
to his products to, is boners.

43:26.540 --> 43:27.980
And that might even be psychosomatic.

43:27.980 --> 43:33.140
Yeah, totally, but every time somebody talks about it, there's never like, I have more

43:33.140 --> 43:36.220
energy, or like, I feel more assertive.

43:36.220 --> 43:38.740
It's always like, my wife hates me now.

43:38.740 --> 43:39.980
You know, like it's never...

43:39.980 --> 43:44.880
Yeah, but if you're taking that, maybe you have some kind of a mental block that's inhibiting

43:44.880 --> 43:46.340
your ability to come around.

43:46.340 --> 43:49.740
Or it's just basically bull testosterone that you shove in your face.

43:49.740 --> 43:51.060
It's possible too, I don't know.

43:51.060 --> 43:54.900
But anyway, the fact that this caller who's plugging Alex's product doesn't understand

43:54.900 --> 43:58.680
the placebo effect, that is like, art.

43:58.680 --> 43:59.680
You can't have science.

43:59.680 --> 44:00.680
It's perfect.

44:00.680 --> 44:01.680
You can't get it.

44:01.680 --> 44:02.680
It's perfect though.

44:02.680 --> 44:03.680
It's so...

44:03.680 --> 44:04.680
Trax.

44:04.680 --> 44:05.680
Yeah.

44:05.680 --> 44:07.900
It's just, they're just not ready for it.

44:07.900 --> 44:12.540
They're just not, just like how like Galileo, admittedly he was a dick, but the people around

44:12.540 --> 44:16.740
him just weren't ready for science yet, and he kept trying to give it to him, and then

44:16.740 --> 44:17.740
he got trapped.

44:17.740 --> 44:21.420
I mean, again, that was mainly because he was a dick.

44:21.420 --> 44:23.300
But it happens, you know?

44:23.300 --> 44:24.460
Those people weren't ready for science.

44:24.460 --> 44:25.460
They weren't ready for science.

44:25.460 --> 44:26.880
These people aren't ready for science.

44:26.880 --> 44:28.380
You know what Alex isn't ready to do?

44:28.380 --> 44:29.380
Take calls?

44:29.380 --> 44:30.380
Stop talking about David Knight.

44:30.380 --> 44:31.380
Okay.

44:31.380 --> 44:34.580
I've had the idea for this show for many, many years, never done it.

44:34.580 --> 44:39.940
I decided to do this at about two o'clock yesterday.

44:39.940 --> 44:43.660
I made the decision to go ahead and just launch this show immediately.

44:43.660 --> 44:45.920
Bad idea.

44:45.920 --> 44:46.920
Really regretting that.

44:46.920 --> 44:47.920
We're all stressed out.

44:47.920 --> 44:48.920
There's so much going on.

44:48.920 --> 44:49.920
There's so much happening.

44:49.920 --> 44:51.380
We could have just taken the day off.

44:51.380 --> 44:56.020
I would watch David Knight, who's just a great guy, get ready for four hours in the morning

44:56.020 --> 45:01.900
before he went on at 8 a.m., and then I would sometimes get off my show at like two o'clock,

45:01.900 --> 45:08.580
and he would be in the studio researching, looking like he was in living hell, and I

45:08.580 --> 45:12.140
was like, dude, you've got to not work 16 hours a day.

45:12.140 --> 45:16.500
I mean, stacks of notes, computers out, just insane.

45:16.500 --> 45:19.460
Isn't that what you say you do, Alex?

45:19.460 --> 45:20.460
Unreal.

45:20.460 --> 45:22.780
So now he said he's firing David because he works too hard.

45:22.780 --> 45:23.780
He works too hard.

45:23.780 --> 45:25.220
He works too hard.

45:25.220 --> 45:28.100
The man is too committed to the info war.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.140
That's why I had to fire him.

45:29.140 --> 45:31.500
I've never seen him in flip flops.

45:31.500 --> 45:33.220
He's too serious.

45:33.220 --> 45:37.620
So we have both, he's not committed, and he doesn't care enough, and that's why he can't

45:37.620 --> 45:40.860
be on the front lines, and also, he works too hard.

45:40.860 --> 45:42.180
He researches all the time.

45:42.180 --> 45:43.180
He's just too committed.

45:43.180 --> 45:46.580
He's here at four in the morning, grinding.

45:46.580 --> 45:49.760
He's not committed to the info war, Dan.

45:49.760 --> 45:52.380
He's treating this as if it's some kind of job.

45:52.380 --> 45:54.380
None of this makes sense.

45:54.380 --> 45:59.020
It's a little bit internally inconsistent, but it is fun to just hear him go all over

45:59.020 --> 46:00.020
the place.

46:00.020 --> 46:04.740
But look, whatever the actual reason behind it, David needed a break, and Alex knows that

46:04.740 --> 46:06.500
because he needs a break.

46:06.500 --> 46:08.460
Alex needs a break.

46:08.460 --> 46:11.220
But I just wanted to have a clean break.

46:11.220 --> 46:15.980
It hit me yesterday morning, watched him on the show and worried about him.

46:15.980 --> 46:17.140
And so that's what this is.

46:17.140 --> 46:21.580
And it's also a financial issue.

46:21.580 --> 46:23.740
David doesn't get paid that much, whatever, does a great job.

46:23.740 --> 46:28.780
It's just that we don't have enough crew to run all these shows, and they're burnt out.

46:28.780 --> 46:33.920
And with COVID, a few people's wives or whatever were in a place that had it, so they had to

46:33.920 --> 46:35.140
leave and take care of them.

46:35.140 --> 46:42.700
And it's just been like we're a NASCAR that has been in two or three races, but hasn't

46:42.700 --> 46:45.140
even had the engine looked at.

46:45.140 --> 46:47.180
And now there's fire coming out of the engine.

46:47.180 --> 46:50.940
So I'm taking off all next week, and I never take off a full week.

46:50.940 --> 46:53.200
I always work wherever I'm at.

46:53.200 --> 46:57.820
I'm going to literally hide my phone and turn the computers off.

46:57.820 --> 47:01.500
And I told my wife last night, I said, we're going to put your phone up, and we're going

47:01.500 --> 47:05.080
to spend time with the family, and I'm going to disconnect and come back five years younger.

47:05.080 --> 47:09.300
I believe he probably is going to take the week off, but it's also Christmas.

47:09.300 --> 47:10.300
Wow.

47:10.300 --> 47:14.860
I mean, he deserves a break, so he's going to do something out of this world and take

47:14.860 --> 47:17.380
the week of Christmas off.

47:17.380 --> 47:19.340
Some people would never dream of doing that.

47:19.340 --> 47:20.820
I'm going to take him at his word.

47:20.820 --> 47:22.860
They're called everybody who doesn't care.

47:22.860 --> 47:25.240
I'm going to take him at his word and believe that he is actually going to take the week

47:25.240 --> 47:26.860
off, and we'll see if he does or not.

47:26.860 --> 47:27.860
That'd be nice.

47:27.860 --> 47:30.900
He's talking about what's going to happen on the shows, and he's like, Owen Schreier

47:30.900 --> 47:33.620
is going to host this morning's show and my show.

47:33.620 --> 47:36.060
And they're like, wait, his show's on right after your show.

47:36.060 --> 47:37.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:37.060 --> 47:38.060
Put Owen Schreier to it.

47:38.060 --> 47:39.060
Put him through the gauntlet.

47:39.060 --> 47:40.060
Hell yeah.

47:40.060 --> 47:42.380
Harrison Smith's going to host the war room.

47:42.380 --> 47:45.020
No, I want Owen to go through the crucible.

47:45.020 --> 47:49.740
We have to be on air from eight to four, eight to five every day.

47:49.740 --> 47:51.540
How else are you going to get your chaps, man?

47:51.540 --> 47:54.540
I used to go out and do four or five sets in a night.

47:54.540 --> 47:59.820
You got to get your chaps going, so you might as well work 12 hour days.

47:59.820 --> 48:09.340
Anchoring a absurd call-in show, then sensational thing, then conspiracy bro down.

48:09.340 --> 48:10.340
Yeah, yeah.

48:10.340 --> 48:11.340
Three different vibes.

48:11.340 --> 48:12.340
Yeah.

48:12.340 --> 48:13.340
Yeah, it's not going to work.

48:13.340 --> 48:14.340
Yeah, no, it's not going to work.

48:14.340 --> 48:17.980
So Alex gets to another caller who has an interesting question.

48:17.980 --> 48:21.860
Everything that you said about needing your essential vitamins and minerals, that should

48:21.860 --> 48:22.860
be enough.

48:22.860 --> 48:26.580
Nobody needs these vaccines on top of everything else that's wrong with them.

48:26.580 --> 48:32.880
But my daughter is a mortician in Arizona and she's busy.

48:32.880 --> 48:33.880
She won't listen.

48:33.880 --> 48:36.640
She used to be open-minded and I don't know how to get through to her.

48:36.640 --> 48:38.340
And I just want to know if you have any suggestions.

48:38.340 --> 48:42.260
Well, I mean, I'm sure you've seen the band segment, a band out video with all the nurses

48:42.260 --> 48:45.420
and doctors, hundreds of videos saying it's an overblown fraud.

48:45.420 --> 48:49.520
We've got all these top scientists saying the John Hopkins report that came out said

48:49.520 --> 48:54.160
there's been as many deaths this year as there was this time last year of other things show

48:54.160 --> 48:59.780
if the overall death rate's not up, that means they're moving other deaths of flu and pneumonia

48:59.780 --> 49:04.100
and other things into the COVID column, which we know they're doing.

49:04.100 --> 49:07.860
Can't imagine why this lady's mortician daughter isn't listening to her.

49:07.860 --> 49:14.940
I don't know why my daughter is working also 12 hour days and she just doesn't believe

49:14.940 --> 49:15.940
me.

49:15.940 --> 49:17.160
Well, she looks sadder than David Knight.

49:17.160 --> 49:18.940
She looks real sad.

49:18.940 --> 49:21.080
Something's really weighing on her, you know.

49:21.080 --> 49:24.940
Johns' narrative here is a load of shit, and if he did one tenth of the research he pretends

49:24.940 --> 49:26.380
to, he would know that.

49:26.380 --> 49:30.560
So here's what happened with that Johns Hopkins thing that he's talking about.

49:30.560 --> 49:35.200
On November 13th, an economics lecturer at Johns Hopkins used faulty data to assert that

49:35.200 --> 49:38.940
there was no evidence of excess deaths in the United States this year.

49:38.940 --> 49:42.360
The numbers and analysis this lecturer were using were elementary and didn't take into

49:42.360 --> 49:46.760
account a bunch of relevant variables, whereas peer reviewed studies that follow higher standards

49:46.760 --> 49:51.340
have regularly shown an approximately 20% increase in mortality this year over long

49:51.340 --> 49:53.020
term averages.

49:53.020 --> 49:57.280
This wasn't a study or a report, it was a misrepresentation of data that was delivered

49:57.280 --> 49:58.760
in a lecture.

49:58.760 --> 50:04.420
This claim was then covered in the Johns Hopkins student newspaper, the Johns Hopkins newsletter.

50:04.420 --> 50:09.140
Naturally, as soon as people noticed, the paper retracted the story and issued a correction.

50:09.140 --> 50:13.040
In the meantime, however, the Gateway Pundit had found the article and began reporting

50:13.040 --> 50:16.460
on the erroneous claim made by the econ lecturer.

50:16.460 --> 50:20.000
The right-wing conspiracy narrative is that the lecturer is correct and that the retraction

50:20.000 --> 50:24.840
is a cover-up of this obviously accurate information, but that's a bunch of nonsense.

50:24.840 --> 50:28.360
Even the Gateway Pundit's framing of the story is intentionally misleading.

50:28.360 --> 50:32.760
Their headline was, quote, Johns Hopkins study mysteriously disappears after it revealed

50:32.760 --> 50:37.080
in spite of COVID no more deaths in 2020 than in prior years.

50:37.080 --> 50:42.420
There was no study to disappear, it was just a fabricated and sensationalized headline.

50:42.420 --> 50:46.180
You can follow the thread from right-wing bullshit website reporting on blog posts from

50:46.180 --> 50:49.900
another right-wing bullshit website all the way back to the student newspaper article

50:49.900 --> 50:52.320
that has been retracted.

50:52.320 --> 50:56.580
Even in that article, they say that the lecturer, quote, also mentioned that more research and

50:56.580 --> 51:01.820
data are needed to truly decipher the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the United States.

51:01.820 --> 51:05.700
So basically you have an economics lecturer who gave a talk where she inaccurately interpreted

51:05.700 --> 51:10.020
some data, which was then covered by a student newspaper, which was then inaccurately reported

51:10.020 --> 51:11.760
on by dumb right-wing blogs.

51:11.760 --> 51:16.160
The student article was retracted, which the right-wing blogs then made part of the conspiracy.

51:16.160 --> 51:17.160
Of course.

51:17.160 --> 51:21.260
This is then reported on by Alex as Johns Hopkins proving in a study that there's no

51:21.260 --> 51:26.220
excess deaths in 2020 and that COVID deaths are all a hoax or just other deaths shuffled

51:26.220 --> 51:30.160
over, which is what this caller should then tell her mortician daughter to help open her

51:30.160 --> 51:32.100
mind about vaccine denialism.

51:32.100 --> 51:33.700
Oh boy.

51:33.700 --> 51:34.700
American Journal.

51:34.700 --> 51:38.420
I do not want to denigrate student newspapers at all.

51:38.420 --> 51:45.300
During the protests in Chicago, student newspapers did a million times better job than any other

51:45.300 --> 51:50.140
local media, and especially better than the national media in Chicago.

51:50.140 --> 51:52.140
There's a double-edged sword to student.

51:52.140 --> 51:55.220
But at the same time, it's still a student newspaper.

51:55.220 --> 52:01.660
We can't be, the right-wing can't be like, ah, student newspaper did something, so yeah.

52:01.660 --> 52:08.580
It's sort of a, it's hard to make like a full statement on, because it's like, okay, yeah,

52:08.580 --> 52:13.260
some student journalists are amazingly capable and can do good work.

52:13.260 --> 52:14.260
Totally.

52:14.260 --> 52:18.660
You know, some mistakes that wouldn't happen in professional newsrooms can happen at student

52:18.660 --> 52:21.220
newspapers because they're student newspapers.

52:21.220 --> 52:22.220
Exactly.

52:22.220 --> 52:24.860
It's, you know, the knife cuts both ways.

52:24.860 --> 52:25.860
Totally.

52:25.860 --> 52:26.860
It's tough.

52:26.860 --> 52:27.860
Totally.

52:27.860 --> 52:28.860
So we got another caller.

52:28.860 --> 52:29.860
Yeah.

52:29.860 --> 52:31.220
Let's take a few calls here before we go to break, and I'll come back and take nothing

52:31.220 --> 52:33.660
but calls, but I wanted to hit those stories.

52:33.660 --> 52:41.100
Holding the longest would be Kurt in Oklahoma, Kurt, welcome.

52:41.100 --> 52:48.340
There is nothing better, nothing more comfy than waking up, saying a prayer, brewing a

52:48.340 --> 52:55.380
cup of Wake Up America Patriot Blend, and calling in to the American Journal.

52:55.380 --> 52:56.380
That's right, sir.

52:56.380 --> 52:58.060
Well, we're honored to be here, and we're glad to be taking your calls.

52:58.060 --> 53:00.540
What is your view on this situation with the vaccines?

53:00.540 --> 53:02.820
So this guy's plugging Alex's coffee.

53:02.820 --> 53:03.820
Yeah.

53:03.820 --> 53:05.340
It's just, it's getting annoying at this point.

53:05.340 --> 53:06.340
It's very frustrating.

53:06.340 --> 53:11.060
Oh, there's nothing more relaxing than drinking your coffee and calling in to the first episode.

53:11.060 --> 53:12.060
Yeah.

53:12.060 --> 53:13.060
Of your show.

53:13.060 --> 53:18.060
Is that some sort of, like, among Info Wars, like, diehard listeners, is that some sort

53:18.060 --> 53:20.700
of meme, like a way they communicate with each other?

53:20.700 --> 53:21.700
That's interesting.

53:21.700 --> 53:25.420
Okay, if you plug, you know, like, we're all so used to Alex plugging.

53:25.420 --> 53:26.420
Yeah.

53:26.420 --> 53:29.660
Like, is that part of, like, a memetic language that they have with each other?

53:29.660 --> 53:34.580
It's possible, and I also think that a lot of times Alex's ads end up using callers in

53:34.580 --> 53:35.580
them.

53:35.580 --> 53:36.580
Right.

53:36.580 --> 53:37.580
Because there is that, like, frack, I need your help, frack.

53:37.580 --> 53:38.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:38.580 --> 53:39.580
That you would play.

53:39.580 --> 53:40.580
So maybe they're hoping...

53:40.580 --> 53:41.900
Yeah, that could be.

53:41.900 --> 53:44.700
They're hoping that they'll become a commercial that Alex uses.

53:44.700 --> 53:45.700
Right, right, right.

53:45.700 --> 53:46.700
I don't know, that's possible.

53:46.700 --> 53:47.700
That would be interesting.

53:47.700 --> 53:51.500
I mean, I know that when I was, like, 13, 14, I would call and request a song on the

53:51.500 --> 53:53.260
radio, like, call the DJs.

53:53.260 --> 53:56.700
I was hoping that they would record it and use it to introduce the song.

53:56.700 --> 53:57.700
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

53:57.700 --> 53:59.900
Maybe that's the same thing, but they're adults.

53:59.900 --> 54:00.900
Yeah.

54:00.900 --> 54:02.780
They're trying to help Alex sell pills.

54:02.780 --> 54:08.780
Yeah, that's a little bit less, it's lower on the totem pole than Rick asking for a song.

54:08.780 --> 54:09.780
Yeah.

54:09.780 --> 54:10.780
Exactly.

54:10.780 --> 54:12.780
That caller, just in case you were worried about this.

54:12.780 --> 54:13.780
Not into the vaccine.

54:13.780 --> 54:15.780
In case you're curious.

54:15.780 --> 54:22.020
Something that Alex isn't into is stop talking about David Knight.

54:22.020 --> 54:25.140
And I intend to host this some, I intend to get other hosts that are going to rotate through

54:25.140 --> 54:26.140
maybe David Knight if you want, sometimes.

54:26.140 --> 54:27.140
I'll come in and do it.

54:27.140 --> 54:31.380
I'm going to show a TV viewer something that was just regularly a David Knight slot for

54:31.380 --> 54:37.280
the last four years, and I just abruptly decided yesterday to end that show because it was

54:37.280 --> 54:42.580
just my gut level thing to do, the right thing to do for David, for him, for us, for the

54:42.580 --> 54:47.300
country, for the world, because the country that he's been worn out and exhausted by this,

54:47.300 --> 54:48.300
just like I am.

54:48.300 --> 54:50.060
And my gut, my spirit told me to do it.

54:50.060 --> 54:51.060
Here's an example.

54:51.060 --> 54:52.060
Here's a promo.

54:52.060 --> 54:57.500
We started putting out last week, send out to all these TV stations and around the country

54:57.500 --> 55:00.500
saying if you haven't picked up the David Knight show top thing here, please pick up

55:00.500 --> 55:01.500
the David Knight show.

55:01.500 --> 55:07.260
Then Alex Jones, then the war room, this has been sent out starting last week to every

55:07.260 --> 55:12.100
one explaining that we're on galaxy 16 video satellite, AMC 18 radio satellite.

55:12.100 --> 55:13.100
I love David.

55:13.100 --> 55:18.000
He's been here nine years, really smart guy, but the election and some of our political

55:18.000 --> 55:20.800
disagreements were making him super upset.

55:20.800 --> 55:21.800
Not me.

55:21.800 --> 55:22.800
Oh, okay.

55:22.800 --> 55:23.800
Okay.

55:23.800 --> 55:25.460
So now he's pissed off.

55:25.460 --> 55:26.460
Not okay.

55:26.460 --> 55:27.460
First.

55:27.460 --> 55:31.280
So now David is uncomfortable about political disagreements with Alex, but Alex, totally

55:31.280 --> 55:32.280
cool.

55:32.280 --> 55:33.280
Above it.

55:33.280 --> 55:34.280
Totally cool.

55:34.280 --> 55:35.280
He's chill.

55:35.280 --> 55:36.280
He's chill as hell.

55:36.280 --> 55:40.260
And also the whole thing about the promotional materials being sent out last week.

55:40.260 --> 55:42.500
It sounds like nobody picked up David Knight's show.

55:42.500 --> 55:44.160
So they canned him.

55:44.160 --> 55:45.160
That's possible.

55:45.160 --> 55:49.620
But Alex is trying to use that as evidence that like, I don't know.

55:49.620 --> 55:51.940
We've got more support behind David Knight's show.

55:51.940 --> 55:52.940
Yeah.

55:52.940 --> 55:53.940
Yeah.

55:53.940 --> 55:56.740
All that proves is like maybe it was a snap decision.

55:56.740 --> 55:57.740
Yeah.

55:57.740 --> 55:58.740
That's all.

55:58.740 --> 55:59.740
Yeah.

55:59.740 --> 56:00.740
Nobody picked up his show.

56:00.740 --> 56:01.740
Yeah.

56:01.740 --> 56:05.260
I think if you've been racking your brain and so worried about how much work he puts

56:05.260 --> 56:09.980
in, the fact that you had promotional materials that came out last week doesn't help your

56:09.980 --> 56:10.980
case.

56:10.980 --> 56:18.140
I feel like everybody's so attuned to the vagaries of the TV show business now that

56:18.140 --> 56:19.700
there's a part of the...

56:19.700 --> 56:22.540
Why not just say that we didn't pick up his show again?

56:22.540 --> 56:23.540
Right.

56:23.540 --> 56:24.540
Like it's not hard.

56:24.540 --> 56:25.540
Right.

56:25.540 --> 56:28.620
It could be so easy and everybody'd be like, oh, there's a reason, but they just didn't

56:28.620 --> 56:29.620
pick up the show.

56:29.620 --> 56:30.620
Hey, Alex.

56:30.620 --> 56:31.620
Shut up.

56:31.620 --> 56:34.380
Heroes didn't get a third season and everybody's like, well, yeah, they didn't pick up the

56:34.380 --> 56:35.460
show.

56:35.460 --> 56:36.820
It's...

56:36.820 --> 56:38.140
Or did it get a third season?

56:38.140 --> 56:39.140
I know they had a comeback.

56:39.140 --> 56:40.140
Ooh, that's not good.

56:40.140 --> 56:41.140
It was bad.

56:41.140 --> 56:42.140
It wasn't good.

56:42.140 --> 56:43.140
That's not good.

56:43.140 --> 56:47.340
Look, dude, there are a hundred ways you could do this and none of it requires any of this

56:47.340 --> 56:48.340
shit.

56:48.340 --> 56:49.340
None of this shit!

56:49.340 --> 56:50.340
No.

56:50.340 --> 56:54.700
We've got 16 reasons, some of which are I'm a hero and the others are David Knight's disagreeing

56:54.700 --> 56:56.540
with me and the others are insane.

56:56.540 --> 56:57.540
Mm-hmm.

56:57.540 --> 56:58.540
Oh, boy.

56:58.540 --> 57:03.700
But we do have one explanation for his termination that we get crossed off the list here.

57:03.700 --> 57:04.700
Why?

57:04.700 --> 57:06.460
One thing that definitely had nothing to do with it.

57:06.460 --> 57:08.900
He does have both feet.

57:08.900 --> 57:12.380
And during the break, they're like, yeah, people think you got rid of David because

57:12.380 --> 57:13.380
of Steve Pacinek.

57:13.380 --> 57:17.380
Steve Pacinek didn't even enter my mind and those two fighting with each other.

57:17.380 --> 57:18.380
So it was him.

57:18.380 --> 57:21.380
Zero, zero, zero to do with it.

57:21.380 --> 57:28.940
It had to do with David was very ashen, very white, looked really sick to him.

57:28.940 --> 57:29.940
Wow.

57:29.940 --> 57:33.740
And I thought about telling him quit at that point because he looked so depressed.

57:33.740 --> 57:34.740
Okay.

57:34.740 --> 57:35.740
And I almost did it then.

57:35.740 --> 57:39.600
And he had a massive heart attack and almost died and he's been looking the same.

57:39.600 --> 57:40.600
And that's it.

57:40.600 --> 57:42.060
And it's not a personal issue.

57:42.060 --> 57:43.060
It's none of that.

57:43.060 --> 57:44.060
I care about David.

57:44.060 --> 57:45.060
He needs a break.

57:45.060 --> 57:46.060
He just needs a break.

57:46.060 --> 57:47.060
Oh, man.

57:47.060 --> 57:49.220
Listen, it's not Steve.

57:49.220 --> 57:54.060
Now there's nothing that makes me know it's Steve more than him being like, I never thought

57:54.060 --> 57:55.060
about it.

57:55.060 --> 57:57.220
Zero possibility, zero possibility of that.

57:57.220 --> 58:01.360
It makes me more suspicious of that for sure.

58:01.360 --> 58:06.780
And this is one of those instances where it's not just you and I have been saying that.

58:06.780 --> 58:09.660
Sometimes Alex will say like, oh, people will say I kill dogs a lot.

58:09.660 --> 58:10.660
We say that.

58:10.660 --> 58:11.660
That's us.

58:11.660 --> 58:12.660
Yeah.

58:12.660 --> 58:16.020
This is something that a lot of people on Twitter have been pointing out because David

58:16.020 --> 58:19.980
was tweeting on about how Steve sucks.

58:19.980 --> 58:23.940
So it is a little bit more of a public thing, but look, dude, he just worked too hard.

58:23.940 --> 58:24.940
That's all it is.

58:24.940 --> 58:25.940
He was ashen.

58:25.940 --> 58:27.160
I care about David.

58:27.160 --> 58:28.160
He needs a break.

58:28.160 --> 58:30.940
I mean, again, four hours before the show getting ready.

58:30.940 --> 58:35.720
Three hours of a show, three, four hours after studying, looking like he's in hell.

58:35.720 --> 58:38.920
And so I fired him.

58:38.920 --> 58:39.920
God told me to do it.

58:39.920 --> 58:41.340
It was like 10 a.m. over there.

58:41.340 --> 58:42.340
God told me.

58:42.340 --> 58:43.340
Okay.

58:43.340 --> 58:44.340
I've got to go let David go.

58:44.340 --> 58:46.680
It's just got to do it clean and be done.

58:46.680 --> 58:48.460
And then later at the show, they go, what are you going to do?

58:48.460 --> 58:49.700
And I said, I guess we'll cancel the show.

58:49.700 --> 58:51.780
And they go, a lot of stations picked that up.

58:51.780 --> 58:52.780
I said, I'm too exhausted.

58:52.780 --> 58:53.780
I'm taking off next week.

58:53.780 --> 58:54.780
I might quit.

58:54.780 --> 58:55.780
This is a real conversation.

58:55.780 --> 58:56.780
They said, you can't quit.

58:56.780 --> 58:59.740
They said, I know I just can't focus on the evil anymore.

58:59.740 --> 59:01.100
I know how David feels.

59:01.100 --> 59:03.320
And then you feel like you're not doing enough.

59:03.320 --> 59:05.340
And then I and then your brain runs out of dopamine.

59:05.340 --> 59:07.100
And then I'm super exhausted.

59:07.100 --> 59:08.740
And I don't even have time with my children.

59:08.740 --> 59:12.420
They said, just take off next week and think about what you're going to do.

59:12.420 --> 59:16.260
But I had to make that decision because I didn't make the decision when my gut told

59:16.260 --> 59:19.180
me to do it the last time he almost died.

59:19.180 --> 59:20.180
Okay.

59:20.180 --> 59:21.420
So I told God this.

59:21.420 --> 59:22.500
I've told you this.

59:22.500 --> 59:26.700
I'm going my gut now, period, because it's never been wrong.

59:26.700 --> 59:28.940
And I haven't been following my whole life.

59:28.940 --> 59:31.860
And the more I follow my gut, the more I never make mistakes.

59:31.860 --> 59:34.740
So I'm not going to put into all the reasons of why it happened.

59:34.740 --> 59:37.300
It has zero to do with Steve Puccini.

59:37.300 --> 59:38.300
Okay.

59:38.300 --> 59:39.300
So it was Steve Puccini.

59:39.300 --> 59:42.100
That pissed me off during the break when they were like, uh, yeah, they think it's so I'm

59:42.100 --> 59:43.660
not involved in this Twitter beef.

59:43.660 --> 59:44.660
Yeah, man.

59:44.660 --> 59:47.020
This, this playground nonsense on Twitter.

59:47.020 --> 59:51.200
So Steve Puccini, I will, I will put that down.

59:51.200 --> 59:53.500
The lady doth protest too much.

59:53.500 --> 59:54.500
No kidding.

59:54.500 --> 59:55.900
Come on, man.

59:55.900 --> 59:58.620
I'm pissed off that people saw through the bullshit.

59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.280
We did pick up his show.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.980
That's all you have to say.

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:03.780
Or it could just be like, it's personal.

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:04.780
Yeah.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:05.780
Yeah.

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:09.140
You know how many people have left Info Wars in the past?

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:10.140
Yeah.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.620
How few of them anyone care has gone now.

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:13.620
Yeah.

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.620
I couldn't, I can't imagine.

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:18.060
I mean, I guess there's some like old timers who probably like, Hey, where's Jakari?

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.060
Where's Leanne McAdoo?

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:21.100
But like, no one cares now.

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.100
Joe Biggs is gone.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.620
No one gives a shit.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:28.220
David and I had a creative disagreements and so I let him go.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:31.060
I honestly think that the financial thing is probably your best play.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.700
If he could have just stuck to that.

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:33.700
We're broke.

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:34.700
Yeah.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:35.700
Yeah.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:38.740
Because that elicits support from the audience who want to see your thing not disappear.

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:43.660
It doesn't require you to get into the mud with David about how he works too hard, which

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:44.660
is confusing.

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:45.660
Wild.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.980
Cause he's also not committed at all to the Info War.

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:48.980
Right.

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:52.020
And his workload seems to be less than you pretend you have for yourself.

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.020
Exactly.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.340
It's all just too complicated.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:59.100
Just say like we had a really good salary for him and we couldn't carry it into the

01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:01.180
next quarter or whatever.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:04.700
There's like, that would be adult, right?

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:09.540
But because it is definitely personal, he just can't stick to the story.

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.460
It almost certainly has to be.

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:12.620
It is personal.

01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:14.540
And so we can't stick to the fucking story.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.660
There's a mystery here.

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:20.860
And I think what I might need to do on Alex's week off, this is going to be painful as hell.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:24.620
I might have to go through the last shows that David Knight did and see if there's some

01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:25.620
kind of a clue.

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:26.620
No.

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:27.620
I don't know.

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:28.620
Maybe there will be.

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:29.620
I don't know.

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:32.020
That would be a terrible Christmas episode for us to put out.

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:37.180
I just hope that Alex Jones fires me for the next thing I'm about to say.

01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:40.420
I am working too hard.

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:43.380
So Alex gets off this topic for a moment.

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:47.300
Anybody notice my ashen face lately?

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:55.380
So leaving aside Alex's anger and confusion about what exactly happened, he has some optimism.

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:59.660
Now I've told you, Trump has a real shot at staying in office and defeating this election

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:00.660
fraud.

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:04.960
If he gets bold and if he comes out against the globalist and points out that Biden's

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.300
a communist Chinese agent, and if he puts all his people in from the Pentagon at key

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:14.220
positions and sells the American people on a limited form of martial law that General

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.380
Flynn and others have rightfully called for.

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:18.380
When do you call martial law?

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:22.560
When there is a foreign power that has occupied you.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.040
That is what the definition says.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:28.100
That's the reasons for martial law under US military history.

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:29.100
Wow.

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:33.060
So declared 60 something times in US history, it's usually for insurrections or things like

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.060
that.

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:35.060
This is a ChaiCom takeover.

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:36.060
We are infiltrated.

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.460
Joe Biden does work for China.

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.460
Sure.

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:39.580
India did lie and say he was the president.

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:41.260
They did steal these key areas.

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:42.660
We have all the evidence.

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.620
We bare minimum need a new election.

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:45.620
Wow.

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:50.540
The 64 thing or 60 something odd times martial law has been declared is it's something Alex

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.740
is just repeating from an interview you heard with Mike Flynn.

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:53.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:55.220
So I want to tell you a little trivia.

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.220
Sure.

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:59.080
How many times do you think martial law has been declared since World War II?

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.860
Since World War II, uh, twice.

01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:02.860
Nine.

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:03.860
Nine.

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:04.860
Nine times.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:05.860
Nine times.

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:06.860
Okay.

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:07.860
And you know what?

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:08.860
Five of them.

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:09.860
I found this in an article from 1989.

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:10.860
Sure.

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:11.860
In the Law and Order Journal.

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:12.860
Oh, since World War II.

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:15.700
Five of them, I would almost guarantee are during the civil rights era.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.700
Yes, there we go.

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:18.700
Yeah.

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:23.020
Quote, in five instances, it was designed to counter resistance to federal desegregation

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:24.020
decrees in the south.

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:25.020
There we go.

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:30.060
Over half the times any kind of martial law has been used, it's because of people like

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:34.620
Alex who think that desegregation is a communist plot.

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:35.620
Yeah.

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:36.620
Yes.

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:37.620
It's, it's, it's you.

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:38.620
Yeah.

01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:39.620
Uh.

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:40.620
I was, you know what?

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:47.220
I, I, I, uh, if Trump overthrows the government, does he still get to keep the POTUS Twitter

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.220
account?

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:49.940
You know, cause they're going to transfer it over to Biden.

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:50.940
Jack.

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:51.940
When Biden becomes president.

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:59.540
Do we have, do we have DOTUS dictator, somebody grab up all the dictators, get all the dictator

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:01.540
related Twitter accounts.

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:04.440
Um, Kim Jong Trump.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.440
That would be a good one.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.740
At Kim Jong Trump.

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:07.740
I don't know, man.

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:11.180
I think that Jack would have a really tough decision to make at that point.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.180
Yeah.

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:15.300
Whether he wants to die or give Trump the Twitter handle.

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.300
I don't know.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:17.300
We'll see.

01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:20.460
Billionaires generally are willing to die for causes.

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:24.020
So Alex is at bare minimum new election.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.020
Right.

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.020
Bare minimum.

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.020
Yeah.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.820
Which everybody in the United States will accept.

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:29.820
Yeah.

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.580
That'll be something that we are all like, you know what, we got to get to the bottom

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:33.580
of it this time.

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:34.580
Yeah.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:35.580
Bare minimum new election.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.580
Now back to calls.

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:37.580
Sure.

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.580
Yeah.

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:39.580
Let's talk to Baldy.

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:40.580
Let's talk to Baldy in Florida.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.580
Baldy.

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:42.580
You were down there at the bottom and I missed you.

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:43.580
Sorry.

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:44.580
Go ahead.

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:45.580
Sure.

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.940
Just as a reminder, I'm the one that all through March was calling, begging and pleading with

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:52.100
everyone to realize that this was the April fool's virus.

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:53.100
Real quick.

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:54.340
I do not remember Baldy from that period.

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:55.780
I'm not worried about it.

01:04:55.780 --> 01:05:01.340
Now before I give my Baldy briefing on the pending inoculations, is that a regular segment?

01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:07.980
For generations to come, I wanted to spread the truth that it's President Trump that won

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:08.980
the election.

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:09.980
Hey, brother, do me a favor.

01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:10.980
You got me on speakerphone?

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:11.980
No, sir.

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:12.980
No, I missed you asking.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:13.980
Somebody missed his email.

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:14.980
Speakerphone.

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:15.980
Is this better?

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:16.980
Say it again?

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:17.980
Uh-huh.

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.980
Is this better?

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:19.980
Just hang up.

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:20.980
Just talk quietly.

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:21.980
I got to put him in my home.

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:22.980
I can't handle it.

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:23.980
Oh, boy.

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:24.980
Don't do a call at the show, man.

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:25.980
You knew this was going to happen.

01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:34.060
God, everyone knew this was going to happen.

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:37.420
I'm shocked it doesn't happen more frequently during this episode.

01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:38.420
Oh, man.

01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:42.060
There are some tech issues, but this is the worst of it probably.

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.260
But Alex gets pretty pissed off.

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:45.760
I do not appreciate.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:52.900
If he does not have some sort of performative show or something, if he's just saying this

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:56.260
is a baldy briefing to people in regular life.

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:57.260
Get the fuck out of here.

01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:58.260
No, no, I love it.

01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.260
No friends.

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:00.260
Zero friends.

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:01.260
I want to hang out with Baldy.

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:02.260
No.

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:03.260
No, thank you.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.260
I want to be briefed.

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.260
Here's a baldy briefing for you.

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:06.260
Goodbye, sir.

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:07.260
Thank you.

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.220
I got a baldy briefing for you.

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.220
It's your turn to buy a round.

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:13.060
If that's what he calls sex, I'm out.

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:16.340
So we get another caller, and this was interesting.

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:25.680
He wants to know about Steve's election sting stuff, because there is an interesting thing

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:32.720
that like now, Alex, you need to make a statement on this, because it's obviously not true.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:39.140
So you need to put a flag down somewhere of, is Steve lying to you or is he wrong?

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:40.540
That kind of thing.

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:43.420
And of course this leads into more shitting on David's eyes.

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:44.420
Yes, of course.

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:50.660
And Steve Fuchenich, he did say with certainty that he had that whole sting operation with

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:52.660
the blockchain and all that.

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:53.660
None of that's been verified.

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:56.260
I mean, what's your comment on that?

01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:59.820
From everyone's point of view, it kind of looks like he was a BS-er.

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:01.940
Well, we're sure going to find out.

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:03.180
I mean, I'm not wedded to Steve Fuchenich.

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:08.300
He's been a guest on the show probably 50, 60, 70 times over the years, maybe more, maybe

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.300
a hundred times.

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.300
He went on Owen's show.

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:11.620
I had no idea that was going to happen.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:15.860
I had him on about some other issues, and that's one of the things that pushed David

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:16.860
over the edge.

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:20.260
I mean, I'll just tell people, he started saying he's going to quit to everybody here.

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:21.260
He said, I'm quitting.

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.260
Alex is having Steve Fuchenich on.

01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:25.860
He went in and told, you know, Rob Duke, and he said, shouldn't have him on.

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:27.660
Like Alex doesn't tell you to have one.

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.920
So I don't tell David who to have on.

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:34.960
He shouldn't tell me who to have on, but that had nothing to do with the fact that David

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.460
was saying he wanted to quit.

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.740
He was miserable and he wouldn't quit.

01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:40.580
So I just said, fly my friend.

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:41.580
The door is open.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:47.220
So now, apparently, David wanted out, so I kicked him out the door.

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:48.220
Yeah.

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:53.100
David didn't want me to have Steve Fuchenich on anymore, which had nothing to do with anything.

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:54.260
And he was going to quit.

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.020
So I just said, get to walking.

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:57.020
Get to walking.

01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:02.260
Now also I am pointing out that he told me not to have Steve on my show, which I said

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.980
is a courtesy to a friend.

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:04.980
Yeah.

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.980
Talk to that guy.

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:06.980
He's a menace.

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:07.980
He's ruined your life.

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:08.980
All right.

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:09.980
Okay.

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:12.400
So now we're getting closer to the real answer.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:17.740
Now Alex starts to get a little bit mad about David Knight giving him editorial advice.

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:18.740
Sure.

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:19.740
There we go.

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:20.740
Yeah.

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:21.740
The Steve Fuchenich thing pushed him over the edge.

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.100
He basically told the whole crew he was going to quit.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.520
Well, he didn't do it.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.580
And he said he was going to quit years ago.

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.820
So I finally said, look, dude, you don't want to be here.

01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:29.820
You're free.

01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:32.580
And I like David, but I'm not going to sit there and he's not doing this.

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:33.580
He's a standup guy.

01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:37.380
You can leave a million dollars with that guy in 10 years, come back and every dollar

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:38.380
would be there.

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:41.100
He's a great, true, good guy.

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:42.100
So I fired him.

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:43.100
Engineer.

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:44.100
Yeah.

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:47.660
But like a lot of those guys, like a lot of those guys, it's his way or the highway.

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:49.160
So okay.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.060
It's never me telling David what to have on.

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.060
It's the other way around.

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:55.540
And he didn't do it a lot, but you know, years ago, he's like, Hey, you shouldn't cuss on

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:56.540
the show.

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:57.540
And you know what?

01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:58.540
He's right.

01:08:58.540 --> 01:08:59.540
But sometimes I can't help it.

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:00.860
And we delay it out.

01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:01.860
But it's sad.

01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:02.860
I get it.

01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:03.860
He's older than me.

01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:04.860
I respect my elders, but I'm the boss.

01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:05.860
Does that make sense?

01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:06.860
Yeah.

01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:09.420
He told me how to do my show and I'm pissed off about it.

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:12.780
That's why I had to fire him for his health.

01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:17.260
It has nothing to do with him and Steve pachanic fighting, even though I brought it up multiple

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:18.260
times.

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:22.420
It has nothing to do with him and me fighting, even though I am clearly very angry about

01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.420
it.

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:28.020
And I resent that he told me not to swear on my radio show.

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.260
And I'm still hanging on to it.

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:36.780
Telling me not to swear on my radio show that I will get fined if I swear on top station.

01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:42.700
Someone politely offering me just a little bit of advice as a friend, obviously is him

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:43.700
telling me.

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:44.700
David Knight does sound like a stand-up guy.

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:45.700
Yeah, he does.

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:48.800
Telling Alex not to have Steve on is a blessing.

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.100
That's what I would expect of somebody who worked for me.

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:52.100
That's a friend.

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:53.100
Yeah.

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:55.380
Someone telling him, hey, come on, stop swearing.

01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:57.420
You're letting your passions get the best of you.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:01.420
Your job is contingent on you not swearing on anyone.

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:03.620
It just seems like a guy who's got your back.

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:04.620
Oh, man.

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:05.620
Wow.

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:06.620
Oh, boy.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:08.020
That wasn't because of Steve, though.

01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:09.020
You need to know that.

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:10.020
Oh, sure.

01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:11.340
I respect my elders, but I'm the boss.

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.340
Does that make sense?

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:17.580
And then the last thing I want to do a touch on, because I know we're kind of...

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:20.300
Stop asking me about David, or I'm going to keep saying more.

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.740
I'm asking listeners to drop it, to drop it.

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.540
I swear to God on my children.

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:25.540
Hold on a minute.

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:27.180
I'm not going to let you go.

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:30.700
I swear to God on my children, Steve Pacinek had nothing to do with this.

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:34.100
And David marched up and down the halls here saying he was going to quit for months.

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.100
He's gone.

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.100
Because of Steve Pacinek.

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.100
Come back up.

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.740
So he was marching up and down the hall saying he was going to quit.

01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:40.800
Because of Steve Pacinek.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.180
But Steve had nothing to do with this.

01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:43.180
Nothing to do with this.

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:44.940
And Alex seems a little mad.

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:45.940
Maybe.

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:46.940
A little mad.

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:50.340
Maybe people keep bringing up the real answer and it's making it hard for me to continue

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:51.500
lying about it.

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.860
But this caller didn't say that.

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:54.860
No.

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:59.500
This caller's question was, do you have a comment on that specific piece of bullshit

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:01.420
that was on your show?

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:02.940
Not just Owen's show.

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:06.780
You've talked about the election sting on Infowars on Alex's show as well.

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:07.780
Oh yeah.

01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:12.220
That is a very fair question for someone to ask a commentator.

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.220
Right.

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:14.380
Hey, you put this out.

01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.580
It is inaccurate.

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:18.660
Do you have a statement on what you think?

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:19.900
Would you like to clear that up?

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:22.260
Instead, Alex starts yelling about David Knight.

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:23.260
Great.

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:26.860
Which makes you think that thinking about Steve makes him think about David.

01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:28.940
It makes you think that maybe.

01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:35.140
I swear on my kids lives who are strangely enough, uh, Oh my God, I just heard they died

01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:36.740
after I swear it on their lives.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:37.740
Shit.

01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:38.740
I will.

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:39.740
I will.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:40.740
I think that might be my fault.

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:41.740
I will eat David Knight to save my kids.

01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:42.740
What?

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:43.740
Wait, what's going on?

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:44.740
I don't understand.

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:46.160
Anyway, look dude, had nothing to do with Steve.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.160
So I'm the bad guy.

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:50.580
Just like Tony Montana says, point at me and say good night to the bad man.

01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.580
Okay.

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:53.580
Alex Jones is a bad man.

01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:57.140
This is not a Howard Stern show where we have fighting on the show and fighting with the

01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:58.140
crew.

01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:59.140
I'm not mad at the caller.

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.060
I just can't handle it.

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.780
I just can't handle it.

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:07.420
Everybody's always got to have some drama.

01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:11.980
Steve Pechenik has nothing to do with my decision.

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:16.100
David Knight saying to everyone that would listen, he was going to quit is the reason

01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:17.700
most places you say you're going to quit a couple of times.

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:18.700
They go, go ahead and quit.

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:19.700
How about 200 times?

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:20.980
And I'm not mad at David.

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:23.080
So I have respect for David.

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.100
He got what he wanted.

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:29.140
Oh, let's go ahead and talk to Jefferson in Virginia.

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.140
Jefferson.

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:31.140
You're on the air.

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:32.140
Welcome.

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:33.140
Wow.

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.140
I feel welcome.

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.140
Thank you.

01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:36.140
Yeah.

01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:37.140
Yeah.

01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:38.140
Oh boy.

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:39.140
So a very respectful tribute to David Knight's time.

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:45.180
90% calls on this show, I would say it's not accurate.

01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:51.820
I realize now that the thing that I don't want people to ask me about is going to be

01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:54.460
the only thing we talk about on a call in show.

01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:57.620
I love, I love the idea that this is the American journal.

01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:03.260
We're really getting the pulse of the country and the country is conflicted about why Alex

01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:08.140
fired David, except no one appears to be except Alex.

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:12.980
Alex is the only person who's given contradictory reports on this.

01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:13.980
Oh God.

01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:14.980
Oh boy, buddy.

01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:19.980
I would just totally have accepted a number of explanations if they seemed consistent.

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:20.980
Yeah.

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.540
If you just kept saying the same one.

01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:23.540
Yeah.

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:27.100
It's so overtly and insanely defensive over the one that you are telling me it's not.

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:28.100
For no reason.

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.100
For no reason.

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:30.660
While you're filling in on his show.

01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:31.660
Here's what you could do.

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:33.900
Hey, do you think it's because of Steve Pacenik?

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:34.900
No, no, no.

01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:35.900
It had nothing to do with it.

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:37.340
He's just wasn't feeling well.

01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:38.540
Hey, guess what?

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:39.540
Alex is also a liar.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:40.540
Oh yeah, there's that.

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:42.460
He could just say he had another heart attack.

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:43.460
Ooh, that would be easy.

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:44.460
Yeah.

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:45.940
And then David would get on his Twitter and say, I didn't have a heart attack.

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:46.940
And then who cares?

01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:47.940
Nobody would go forward.

01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:50.220
You're a liar by trade.

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:51.780
No one cares.

01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:52.780
Yeah.

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:57.260
Anyway, I was interested after listening to this American Journal to see how Alex holds

01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:58.260
up on his own show.

01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.260
Of course.

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:03.360
So a little bit after this, he takes this call from Jefferson and then he hangs out

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.360
for a little bit.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.360
It's boring as hell.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:13.940
And then John Rappaport takes over for the last half hour and Alex jumps in and he realizes

01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:17.900
as soon as he gets on his own show that there were some calls that he didn't take on the

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:19.440
American Journal.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.820
And so he calls them back.

01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:22.300
He has the producers call them back.

01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:23.300
Oh, boy.

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:32.060
I was called by a listener and he was on air and reminded me that there's actually a federal

01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:37.340
law saying we can all be experimented on en masse, H.R. 4373.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.100
So we're all about documentation.

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:43.900
The slugs over George Soros run media matters that literally are mercenaries against your

01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:49.900
very life are hoping you don't research this.

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:55.140
I'm guessing that Alex means H.R. 4373 from the most recent session of Congress.

01:14:55.140 --> 01:15:01.940
H.R. 4373 from the 2015-2016 session was the End Drunk Driving Act of 2016.

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:04.460
So I'm guessing that's not what he's talking about.

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:05.860
Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:09.460
He still doesn't know they start over every Congress.

01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:14.140
H.R. 4373 in the most recent Congress is a bill called the Engineering Biology Research

01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:16.760
and Development Act of 2019.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:20.420
In December of last year it passed the House and was sent to the Senate.

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:24.060
There it was sent to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, where no action

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:25.940
has been taken on it since.

01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:27.680
It's essentially a dead bill.

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:31.300
Even if this bill had passed, it wasn't something that would allow large-scale evil testing

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:32.300
on people.

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:35.700
It was basically a declaration that more grants should be given out to engineering biology

01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:40.000
fields to expand the pool of researchers working on those topics.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.760
In case you were curious, though, the End Drunk Driving Act of 2016 didn't even make

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.820
it out of the House.

01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:46.360
That's not surprising.

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:47.460
That's not surprising.

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:48.460
Everybody loves drunk driving.

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:53.080
Yeah, so Alex, you know, Media Matters is afraid of you looking into these things and

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:58.440
finding out these bills that are stalled in committee exist that don't say what I'm gonna

01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.440
pretend they...

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.440
Get the fuck out of here.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:01.440
You didn't look into this.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.440
It would terrify you.

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:03.440
Yeah.

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:07.180
If only you worked half as hard as David Knight pretends to, you'd be able to look into that

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.380
bill and find out whatever.

01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:14.740
Anyway, Alex is sort of continuing a lot of the themes from the American Journal, like

01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:17.900
the whole, like, your placenta will be attacked by the vaccine.

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:18.900
Sure.

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:22.140
Yeah, you're never having a baby again when you take this.

01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:25.640
And the thing is, they're gonna commit this mass crime and have the nurses and the doctors

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.420
all signed on to it, so when it turns out millions have been sterilized and millions

01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:34.620
die, slowly, everyone will enjoy it on the cover-up, and the Nazis call that the cement

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:35.620
of blood.

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:37.940
They'll now be corrupted and follow any order.

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:38.940
Okay.

01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:40.620
All right.

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:41.620
That sounds...

01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:42.620
Okay.

01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:43.620
Sounds scary.

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:46.740
Can you sue for defamation on...

01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:48.340
On the behalf of, like, a field?

01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:49.340
Yeah.

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:50.340
No, no, no.

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:54.260
Not on behalf of them, but, like, could, like, Pfizer just be like, hey, I'm going to sue

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.260
you.

01:16:55.260 --> 01:17:00.260
Well, like, Fox News had to say all those things that they said were lies.

01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:01.500
Sidney Powell's Dominion stuff.

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:02.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:05.300
They had to be like, hey, I'm sorry, we didn't, we lied about that.

01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:10.260
Now, obviously, they're gonna continue lying about it, but can you do that to Alex?

01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:11.260
I mean, nobody cares enough, I guess.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.700
I think it would be hard.

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:18.860
But I mean, it seems like you can't just say that a company's vaccine will force you to

01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:20.460
never have a baby again?

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:24.540
Yeah, it seems like it would be something that should be actionable in some way, but

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.740
I don't know what the mechanism for it would be.

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:30.300
Well, I mean, obviously, the vaccine itself cannot sue for defamation.

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:31.300
It's true.

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:32.300
Yeah.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:35.740
And all the people who, like, really do have some standing don't have the time and are

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:36.740
public figures.

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:37.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:41.440
So, like, Bill Gates would have a really tough time suing Alex for defamation.

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:47.140
Even though, like, I mean, there is actual malice, Alex knows the things he's saying

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.140
are not true.

01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:51.340
Yeah, could the people who actually created the vaccine sue?

01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:52.840
Conceivably.

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:53.840
I don't know.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:54.840
I would be interested.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:55.840
Yeah.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:56.840
I don't know enough.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.840
That would be interesting.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:58.840
Yeah.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:17:59.840
Let's do it.

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:03.700
So, Alex gets another caller from earlier who's still waiting to talk to him.

01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:05.500
He has an interesting question.

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.940
PB in Rhode Island, you're on the air, go ahead.

01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:08.940
Princess Bubblegum?

01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:09.940
Peanut Butter.

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:12.580
Thank you for taking my call and thank you for everything you do.

01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:13.580
Thank you, brother.

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.140
I just got a question for you.

01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:20.580
As far as the communist Chinese leaks of over 2 million communist Chinese agents pretty

01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:25.340
much released around the world, there was a list of 20 United States governors on that

01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:26.340
list.

01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:27.340
That just seems like a lot.

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:31.780
What do you think of that and how come it hasn't really gained as much traction in the

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:32.780
media?

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:34.460
Because the mainstream media is sold out to the Chai-Coms.

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:37.540
I mean, that's what I've been telling everybody forever and now it's come out.

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:40.940
Oh, oh, maybe, maybe because it's not, that's not accurate.

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:41.940
Yeah.

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:42.940
Maybe?

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:43.940
20 seems too high to ignore.

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:44.940
Almost half.

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:45.940
Yeah, 20 seems just too high to-

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:50.100
Almost half of the governors in this country are Chinese secret agents.

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:56.740
If you said like two governors had successfully become secret agents or whatever, that's more

01:18:56.740 --> 01:19:01.100
believable than almost half the entire country is run by communist secret agents?

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.100
Yeah.

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:03.100
Yeah.

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:04.100
Although that caller would have fit in on the American Journal.

01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:05.100
That's true.

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:09.780
Alex is still optimistic at this point on the 18th that Trump is going to seize power

01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:13.220
and he reveals accidentally that Roger is still lying to him.

01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:14.220
Okay.

01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:18.620
I don't ever want to be over positive, but now I see Trump going after the globalist

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:24.240
and I see all these arrests happening and I see them canceling Biden's military briefings

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:27.900
and it tells me Trump's getting ready to drop the hammer.

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:32.140
And I was told something about Trump, I'm not going to say whether I heard it from Trump

01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:40.980
or Roger Stone, but they told me when he was president elect four plus years ago that Trump

01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:43.340
expected this to come down to this.

01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:50.980
And so, look, I'm just telling the new world order, if you're looking for trouble, you

01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:51.980
came to the right place.

01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:52.980
Yeah.

01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.540
I heard this from either Trump or Roger Stone.

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:55.540
Okay.

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:56.540
Yeah, it was Roger Stone.

01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:57.540
Great.

01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:02.980
In 2016, Roger Stone was saying that Trump planned on declaring martial law and seizing

01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:03.980
power.

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:04.980
Yeah, there we go.

01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:05.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:06.980
Oh, cool.

01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:07.980
Glad you signed onto that.

01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.620
When he was president elect, Roger Stone told me that Trump would overthrow this democratic

01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:13.140
government and create a dictatorship.

01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:14.940
So I'm looking forward to that.

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:15.940
Yeah.

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:18.460
I felt like that was the most constitutional thing I could support.

01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:19.980
I mean, it's obvious.

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:24.640
Like Trump is either, when he leaves office, he's either going to lose all of his money

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:27.260
or he's going to wind up going to jail.

01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:29.700
I don't see him de-escalating.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:35.140
I mean, we say that, but like, why wouldn't he just be on the next season of The Masked

01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:36.140
Singer?

01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:37.540
Yeah, that's true.

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:40.820
Why wouldn't he just reinvent himself as a pop star or something?

01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:41.820
I don't know.

01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:45.660
Probably because he's directly responsible for the deaths of what's going to wind up

01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:48.260
being 400 to 500,000 people.

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:54.960
So, I mean, like obviously I'm on your side, but speaking from the other end, who cares?

01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:59.760
There's a giant portion of the population that doesn't care and will give him money.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:00.760
That's true.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:07.420
So like, so in America, that means there's another chapter, as long as, as long as he

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:12.060
doesn't end up going to prison, even if he lost a ton of money, like rags to riches to

01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:14.200
rags to riches or whatever the fuck.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.700
It's not like he hasn't lost a ton of money before.

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:17.700
Exactly.

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:18.700
Yeah, that's true.

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:24.160
So at this point, Alex has gone to break and he comes back and it's very jarring because

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:28.100
he comes in with some rap music and then gets really weird.

01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:32.220
And I'm not going to cover this news in the next hour because there's more coming in.

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:36.860
I want to really tell you what I think and the back of my brain, I'm still percolating

01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:46.340
what's happening, but Trump's going to make a run at them.

01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:48.180
I mean, that's the bottom line.

01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:52.300
And I've talked to really serious people, a lot of them at the Pentagon, and they're

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:56.700
all very excited and are going to make a run at them.

01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:59.380
And they're getting the hearings ready to give them the political backing for what they

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:00.380
need to do.

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.300
They're already raiding facilities.

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:04.580
It really is happening.

01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:08.300
And right here in Austin, the raids did happen in Germany.

01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:11.500
And let's just say this country is fighting for its life right now.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:15.140
And with 33 days left, we should see some big action the next week.

01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:16.980
Well, and I'm going to be taking off.

01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:17.980
Yes.

01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:18.980
Yeah.

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:19.980
Yeah.

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:23.780
So this is classic Alex, just him coming in and being like, I'm not going to cover this

01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:25.260
story because my gut doesn't.

01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:27.580
I'm going to cover it.

01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:29.580
Trump's going to make a run at him.

01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.100
Oh, man.

01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:32.100
Yeah.

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.100
How funny.

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:37.780
So Alex has just heard this Pentagon story, which he covers a little bit.

01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:38.780
Yeah.

01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:43.660
This is out of Axios, Bloomberg, all of it, acting Pentagon chief halts Biden transition

01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:48.140
briefings, signaling that Trump is not going to concede and going to use the military.

01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:51.540
So this is kind of what tipped him over the edge into, like, Trump is going to make a

01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:52.540
run at him.

01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:53.540
Sure.

01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:54.540
Sure.

01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:55.540
It's kind of bullshit.

01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:58.180
The Pentagon has said that the reason for the halt in transition activities is because

01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:02.620
many of the staff felt overwhelmed by the demands of the transition, but are, quote,

01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:05.820
still committed to a productive transition of power.

01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:08.180
We didn't used to have to do our jobs.

01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:09.940
That quote cut off at transition.

01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:11.660
I just said of power.

01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:12.660
Yeah.

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:16.380
So maybe I don't want to mislead by adding to the quote.

01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:17.380
Right.

01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:21.220
You know, the people said that they decided to, quote, take a knee until after the holidays

01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:26.020
because, quote, the D.O.D. staff working the meetings were overwhelmed by the number of

01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:30.500
meetings, and, quote, these same senior leaders needed to do their day jobs and were being

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:33.380
consumed by transition activities.

01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:37.060
I'm fairly cynical, but the way I see this, it's pretty clear that Trump's entire team

01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:40.220
is full of incompetence in the field of actually governing.

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.220
Yeah.

01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:44.100
So it's not a surprise that the people he would choose would be the type of folks would

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:46.060
be overwhelmed by work.

01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:49.460
This is still upsetting and horrible and everything, but I'm not sure it's proof that Trump is

01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:52.420
set to use the military to stay in power.

01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:53.420
No.

01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:58.260
When incompetence among officials that Trump has directly appointed is an option, it's

01:23:58.260 --> 01:23:59.780
almost always the right one.

01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:03.300
We can't get this shit done, and there's too many meetings.

01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:05.100
Oh, no.

01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:06.300
I could see that.

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:07.300
Yeah.

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:12.460
I could also see it being a, like, just almost sabotage, petulance kind of thing.

01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:13.460
Totally.

01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:18.500
I don't know if I think that it's an indication that Trump's going to use the military.

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:24.740
I don't think so, but I mean, it does make so much sense for the transition team to be

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:28.540
like, here's the intelligence that we expect you to give us.

01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:34.220
And they're like, ooh, we were told not to learn that kind of stuff, so we don't have

01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:35.220
it.

01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:40.820
Yeah, running out the clock to show that, ooh, we were drinking these last four years.

01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:42.500
We did nothing.

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:44.580
We were allowed to act with impunity.

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:45.580
Yeah.

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:46.580
That's a possible explanation.

01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:47.580
Totally.

01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:48.580
And I don't know.

01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:49.580
I guess we'll have to see how it plays out.

01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:52.860
But that's really what is behind Alex's ha ha ha.

01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:55.260
Breaking news the entire Biden family is under house arrest.

01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:56.260
Oh, no.

01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:57.260
That's not good.

01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:58.260
Oh, no.

01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:05.540
So Alex has found this news story about the Supreme Court and someone yelling, Justice

01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:10.340
Roberts yelling about how we can't do this.

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:13.860
We can't let Trump's cases come to court.

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:18.460
But it looks bad waiting this long for McConnell to roll over, be a Chiacom agent, the Supreme

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:23.140
Court roll over, be Chiacom agents, have Roberts screaming and yelling, saying the Democrats

01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:24.660
will burn America.

01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:30.840
So we're all scared of Trump's martial law to counter their martial law.

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:39.980
But we got the justice that the opposing chief justice saying we can't do this.

01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:44.540
Because if we do, screaming at the other justices who all crapped their pants and got in line,

01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:48.660
the other eight, that's in the news now.

01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:54.860
Credible sources, congressman sources, the aides, talk to their aides that he pistol

01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:55.860
wept him.

01:25:55.860 --> 01:26:01.380
He he he screamed at him for hours that they'll be riots, they'll be because that's what Black

01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:05.060
Lives Matter and ten point six million dollars of B.S. was.

01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:06.780
So this story isn't true.

01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:11.780
Critics just saw a viral online post about it where a man named Matt Patrick argued at

01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:16.320
a December 14th meeting of the Texas electors that the Supreme Court was too cowardly to

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.240
deal with the issues in front of them.

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:22.160
He claimed to have heard a story from a Supreme Court staffer that Justice Roberts yelled

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:26.100
at fellow judges that they needed to dismiss the Texas attorney general's case, saying

01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:30.260
that he didn't care about Bush versus Gore because there are riots going on and there

01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:31.620
weren't in 2000.

01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:32.620
Sure.

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:34.880
This man did not hear this story from a staffer.

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:38.500
He read it on right wing extremist Hal Turner's website.

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:42.420
Someone wrote Hal Turner anonymously claiming to be a Supreme Court staffer and told this

01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:48.260
story, which Hal reported on December 12th, with absolutely no verification whatsoever.

01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:52.620
There's also very strong reasons just on its face to not believe this story, like what

01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:56.900
was posted and pointed out by Snopes, the fact that the Supreme Court justices have

01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:59.940
not met in person for months because of COVID-19.

01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:00.940
There is that.

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:06.580
There's not really a closed door meeting that this staffer, alleged staffer, could have

01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:07.580
overheard.

01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:08.580
Yeah.

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:12.480
But you could almost, you could almost buy John Roberts just because I'm sure, at least

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:18.620
in some small way, he has to resent Barrett and Kavanaugh because his job used to be so

01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:22.040
much more solemn and like respected.

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:25.700
And now with Barrett and Kavanaugh on there, he's kind of an idiot.

01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:26.700
Yeah.

01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:32.580
You know, whenever you have Notorious on there, you know, it's like she gives you a gravitas

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:37.420
of the Supreme Court of like, look, this is what the Supreme Court can do.

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:42.540
And now, like, Barrett writes her decisions in crayon and it's like, I don't think you're

01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:43.540
supposed to be here.

01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:44.540
Yeah.

01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:46.620
And I can't think of Kavanaugh without thinking of Squeeze.

01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:47.620
Yeah.

01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:48.620
Yeah.

01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:49.620
Yeah.

01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:50.620
Yeah.

01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:51.620
Poor Judge Roberts.

01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:52.620
Oh, I'm so sad for him.

01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:54.100
I'm so sad for- Or maybe not.

01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:58.540
But going down in history as a moron is going to be a real bummer.

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:01.940
Speaking of people who are going to go down in history as morons and are looked as such

01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:05.540
now, David Icke is not on the show.

01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:07.420
However, his son is.

01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:10.460
Then I'll take calls for a couple of segments.

01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:15.180
And then David Icke's son, who's quite the filmmaker, is going to be joining us with

01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:16.380
some big breaking news.

01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:21.260
I love these guys talking about like merits and like getting by based on what you do,

01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:22.260
what you produce.

01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:23.260
Bootstraps.

01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:24.260
We're going to talk to David Icke's son.

01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:27.260
We're going to talk to someone who- Someone who's such a great filmmaker that

01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:31.260
you have to introduce him, not by his name, but as David Icke's son.

01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:32.260
Yeah.

01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:33.260
David Icke's son.

01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:34.260
Yeah.

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:35.260
Wow.

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:36.260
Oh, bad.

01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:37.260
Wow.

01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:38.260
That is sad.

01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:39.260
Yep.

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:40.260
I would not like to be David Icke's son.

01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:41.260
He seems to enjoy it.

01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:42.260
Sure.

01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:47.460
So Alex has noticed that Howard Stern has been doing some segments where they make fun

01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:48.460
of Alex.

01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:49.460
Sure.

01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:50.460
They have been doing that for a while.

01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:51.460
Oh.

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:54.780
And lately, I guess, Alex wants to talk about it.

01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:56.340
I don't know.

01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:59.180
This is really interesting because they are making fun of Alex.

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:00.180
Yeah.

01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:01.900
It's very clearly mocking him.

01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:02.900
Yeah.

01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:04.180
Alex might have a different angle on it.

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:05.180
Interesting.

01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:09.460
But Howard Stern still has a gigantic show, number one show on XM, probably just 5 million

01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:12.260
people a day conservatively that tune in.

01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:15.940
And he's up there every week now doing these puppet show videos.

01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:18.700
They're very viral and send us a lot of new listeners.

01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:22.340
So I don't want to attack Stern too much so he gets in trouble and can't make it.

01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:25.900
I know Stern said he was a listener before and had me on a few times as a guest.

01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:32.100
I was used to go on his network like once a month for years till somebody killed him.

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:35.460
And so I think overall, Stern's trying to actually warn people through the show.

01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:36.460
Maybe I'm wrong.

01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:37.460
Yeah.

01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:38.460
Maybe you're wrong.

01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:39.460
Oh, man.

01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:43.900
So I think that Stern is like subtly trying to get Infowars messages out on his show by

01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:47.500
making fun of me, and I don't want to get too much attention on it.

01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:48.980
So he can't do it anymore.

01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:49.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:50.980
What the fuck?

01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:51.980
Oh, man.

01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:55.980
Yeah, the character of Alex is largely like selling shit.

01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:56.980
Yeah.

01:29:56.980 --> 01:30:03.660
I need to, I like the way that he brings me more attention and doesn't actually affect

01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:09.760
whether or not people believe my bullshit, but I don't like having to say nice things

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:10.760
about it.

01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:11.760
Mm-hmm.

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:12.760
Yeah.

01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:14.340
So Alex has got this idea about Justice John Roberts.

01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:16.700
He's being a coward and all this.

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:19.640
He's yelling behind closed doors.

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:21.100
And actually, Alex knows why.

01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:26.220
Well, that's Roberts getting a call from Holder that's got all the, and Obama that knows about

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:31.740
him and his kidnapped kids and how his adopted kids were kidnapped reportedly.

01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:34.460
And so he's on a very short chain.

01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:35.940
And so he's there going, we got to do this.

01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:36.940
We got to do this.

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:37.940
And so he's a big problem.

01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:38.940
I guess.

01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:43.780
I guess there's blackmail, a good thing Alex threw in reportedly there.

01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:44.780
Yeah.

01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:48.500
Yeah, the Supreme court, notoriously a friend of the Obama administration.

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:49.500
Yeah.

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:50.500
Yeah.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:51.500
Yeah.

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:53.540
Obama and Eric Holder are really coming through right now.

01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:54.540
Yeah.

01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:55.540
Yeah.

01:30:55.540 --> 01:30:56.540
For...

01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:57.540
Good timing.

01:30:57.540 --> 01:30:58.540
I mean like what, what, why?

01:30:58.540 --> 01:30:59.540
Why?

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:00.540
What are they doing?

01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:03.320
What have they been doing?

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:13.780
They want to get the individual mandate back.

01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:15.740
We're going to do it this time guys.

01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:21.020
Now that we know his kids were stolen and that's why he's got them, Holder is ready

01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:22.540
to pull the trigger now.

01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:23.540
Yep.

01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:24.540
That must be it.

01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:25.540
That must be it.

01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:33.740
You'd assume that a number of things would have gone differently if Eric Holder had some

01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:34.800
blackmail on.

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:39.300
That would suggest that when Holder lost, he also was telling him, Hey, look, I'm planning

01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:40.860
on losing this one.

01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:42.900
So make it convincing, I guess.

01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:43.900
Jesus.

01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:44.900
Ridiculous.

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:45.900
Yeah.

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:46.900
So Alex takes more calls.

01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:50.580
And, uh, this, uh, this one, this caller here, uh, wants a civil war.

01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:54.940
If they don't do anything about this, I say, we need to just have a civil war because there's

01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:56.740
no way we'll survive under Biden.

01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:57.740
It's not about us.

01:31:57.740 --> 01:31:58.740
It's about future generations.

01:31:58.740 --> 01:31:59.740
We need to make moves now.

01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:00.740
Sacrifice our lives.

01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:03.740
Well, I know people are ready to fight and that's what scares the enemy.

01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:07.300
My issue is, and thank you for the call, God bless you, Heather.

01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:08.540
I wouldn't even call it a civil war.

01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:12.180
And I mean, this is a foreign occupation with collaborators.

01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:16.220
So this is a recapturing of America operation.

01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:20.180
So I don't, I think, I think there are a lot of forces that aren't going to put up with

01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:21.180
this.

01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:22.180
The Chicom is pissing on us.

01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:23.740
His problem seems to be semantics.

01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:24.740
Yeah.

01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:25.740
It sounds like that.

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:26.740
Yeah.

01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:31.460
I do not appreciate how casual so many people are with banding civil war about.

01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:32.460
It's pretty fucked up.

01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:33.460
Yeah.

01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:34.460
I think we need a civil war.

01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:37.240
You know, just, that's one of those things you talk about in the, you know, we just lay

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.580
down our lives for the future generations.

01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:42.860
We should all just die fighting against our fellow citizens.

01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:43.860
Yeah.

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:45.420
Look, my problem is terminology.

01:32:45.420 --> 01:32:46.420
Yes, exactly.

01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:47.420
My problem with your...

01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:48.420
Exactly.

01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:49.420
That's the real problem.

01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:50.420
I don't like Alex's rebuttal.

01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:51.420
No, no, no.

01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:52.420
It's not good.

01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:53.420
It's not a civil war.

01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:54.620
It's a recapturing.

01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:57.460
It implies that he's okay with everything but the word.

01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:58.460
Yes.

01:32:58.460 --> 01:32:59.460
Pretty much.

01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:02.620
So we get to David Icke's son and we're not going to listen to this interview.

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:05.820
I just have one clip because it's classic Alex.

01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:11.940
They're not going to stop until we stand up as a race, as a species and stop them.

01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:13.980
I mean, I've heard so many times through this.

01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:14.980
I'm sure you have as well.

01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:17.940
You've been asked the question is, when does this end?

01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:23.180
And the simple answer to that is it ends when we stop doing it, ends when we stop allowing

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:24.620
them to control us.

01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:25.620
You know, a bully...

01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.460
Did you know that's basically a Thomas Everson quote.

01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:29.580
He was asked, how bad will tyrants get?

01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:30.580
How bad will they...

01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:31.580
How far will they push?

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:33.780
And he said, exactly as far as you let them.

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:34.780
Oh God.

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:35.780
Yeah, absolutely.

01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:36.780
Yeah, totally.

01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:37.780
Yeah.

01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:38.780
Fake Thomas Jefferson quote.

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:39.780
Still doing the TJ.

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:40.780
Yeah.

01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:41.780
Well, boy.

01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:48.740
So we have one last clip here, Jordan, and this is a mic down clip because it is a return

01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:49.740
to form.

01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:50.740
Okay.

01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.980
It is Alex talking over You Belong to the City.

01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:53.980
Sure.

01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:54.980
I'm excited.

01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:55.980
Yeah.

01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:56.980
We haven't heard a good one of those in a while.

01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:57.980
Yeah.

01:33:57.980 --> 01:33:59.500
And then I think it just ends perfectly.

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.580
This is like a nice little ride.

01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:06.860
It's not his best rant over the song, but the coda to the end, much like the piano in

01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:07.860
Layla.

01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:08.860
Sure.

01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:09.860
Great.

01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:10.860
Makes the song.

01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:11.860
Okay.

01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:39.620
The only thing you need to know is that this

01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:46.300
enemy attack is a desperate counter offensive.

01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:49.340
We are winning.

01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:50.820
Humanity is awakening.

01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:53.420
Humanity holds the keys to human destiny.

01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:59.460
And so as long as you don't submit and as long as you don't hate yourself and as long

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:04.580
as you know how amazing you are and that spark and that splinter of God's mind that created

01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:07.660
you, there's nothing they can do against you.

01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:14.860
As your life is closer to death, every minute becomes more valuable every second until you're

01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:20.020
finally gone at the next level and then there's eternity and nothing but consciousness.

01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:23.180
So you need to transcend that fear.

01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:25.580
He's about to take over here in just a minute or so.

01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:28.700
Kathy in Alaska, go ahead and thanks for holding.

01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:29.700
Hello?

01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:31.700
Oh, boy.

01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:33.700
Oh, man.

01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:46.420
Oh, just like Alex is like an angry Alan Watts, life ticks away and then there's just eternity

01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:47.420
and then...

01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:49.660
I don't know why I can't get this.

01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:55.660
I just want now to hear Carl Sagan's pale blue dot speech, but over you belong to the

01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:56.660
city.

01:35:56.660 --> 01:36:04.660
Is there something really great about that song and Alex's weird rambling space nonsense?

01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:07.700
It's just so good.

01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:16.340
One day we will all fly away on Saturn's rings and there's nothing that evil can do about

01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:20.500
it.

01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:26.540
It is great and then just like the reality that comes crashing, crashing.

01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:28.380
The music dies.

01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:30.380
And then she's like long pause.

01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:31.380
Hello?

01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:32.380
Hello?

01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:33.380
It's just so great.

01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:35.260
Are you going to keep playing You Belong to the City?

01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:36.720
I wanted to talk over it.

01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:37.720
So great.

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:38.720
So great.

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:45.580
I would probably listen to Alex talk over that song for like an hour on the treadmill.

01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:46.580
It would get me there.

01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:47.580
Yeah.

01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:48.580
It would help me.

01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:49.580
Oh, totally.

01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:50.580
Yeah.

01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:55.620
If he was just going to switch to Eckhart Tolle tapes, but only over music, just like

01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:59.820
a banging soundtrack that he talks shit over, I would listen to that.

01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:04.940
You referenced, I think it was on our last episode, the album of Paul Stanley song introductions.

01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:05.940
Yes.

01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:06.940
Yeah.

01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:07.940
People let me get this off my chest.

01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:08.940
Yeah.

01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:14.180
I think it would be awesome if Alex would record just an hour of freeform improvisational

01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:15.180
100%.

01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:16.780
speeches over that sax.

01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:18.700
Sweary Carrie basically did it.

01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:19.700
Yeah.

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:20.700
I mean, she sang.

01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:21.700
A little.

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:22.700
She sang, but yeah.

01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:23.700
Yeah.

01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:29.100
I would love to hear Alex do a William Shatner spoken word style album over You Belong to

01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:30.100
the City.

01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:31.100
The entire, that's the entire background.

01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:32.100
Yeah.

01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:33.100
Oh man.

01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:34.100
Just constant.

01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:35.860
That would win back a lot of hearts and minds, I think.

01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:40.700
That would win a Grammy.

01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:45.700
Open mic eagle is snubbed again, but AJ winds up in the top pop charts.

01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:48.820
This is going to be his first step to Egon it.

01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:57.780
He's going to get a, what would it be called, a delayed Oscar for his star turn in A Scanner

01:37:57.780 --> 01:37:58.780
Darkly.

01:37:58.780 --> 01:37:59.780
Naturally.

01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:00.780
That cameo of him yelling into a bullhorn.

01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:01.780
Yeah.

01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:05.340
They're going to mistake his end game for Avengers End Game and give a retroactive Oscar

01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:06.340
for that.

01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:07.340
Okay.

01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:08.340
You can have two Oscars.

01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:09.340
Yeah.

01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:10.340
Yeah.

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:11.340
Yeah.

01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:13.180
And then he's going to get a Tony for his version of Hamilton.

01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:14.180
Right.

01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:15.180
But it's Jefferson.

01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:16.180
I don't know.

01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:17.180
It's all not true.

01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:18.180
It's all not true.

01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:19.180
Jefferson's ripped.

01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:23.820
It's shirtless the whole time.

01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:28.420
And then he gets an Emmy for that time he was on The View.

01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:29.420
Yeah.

01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:30.420
I would give him an Emmy.

01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:31.420
Egon.

01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:32.420
Egon it.

01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:39.860
So this, somebody is not going to get any awards for as the American Journal.

01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:42.860
That show sucks.

01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:44.820
I hate to say it because I got really excited.

01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:46.100
I'll be honest.

01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:50.700
Whatever like the David Knight firing happened I was very confused.

01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:56.420
And then when I learned the next day that Alex was like really showing some go get em

01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:57.420
spirit.

01:38:57.420 --> 01:38:58.420
Yeah.

01:38:58.420 --> 01:38:59.420
Yeah.

01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:00.420
Some vim.

01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:01.420
Some vigor.

01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:04.620
I was pumped because I was like this could be really fun.

01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:07.960
And instead he just complains about David Knight and takes boring calls like it's not

01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:08.960
a good show.

01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:09.960
Yeah.

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:12.500
It would actually be a better show with Harrison Smith hosting it.

01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:13.500
Right.

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:14.500
Because he's boring as hell.

01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:15.500
Yeah.

01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:19.740
He's the guy who can just be a cardboard cutout with the callers.

01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:20.740
Right.

01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:21.740
That's what he is.

01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:22.740
That's what Washington.

01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:23.740
Yeah.

01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:25.220
That guy has a little bit of competence though.

01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.940
I'm not saying that he's just.

01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:27.940
I think he's great.

01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:28.940
Yeah.

01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:29.940
Yeah.

01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:30.940
He does what he does really well.

01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:31.940
Yeah.

01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:34.440
He's like you know the straight man in a comedy team where you think they're doing nothing

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.440
but it's.

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:36.440
Yeah.

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:37.440
No he's Dave Foley.

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:38.440
There's nuance to that nothing.

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:39.440
Yeah.

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.440
Yeah.

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.440
Harrison Smith would just be nothing.

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:42.440
Yeah.

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:43.440
Yeah.

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:44.440
Yeah.

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:45.440
He's not going to.

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:49.660
I think the power of this entire time was in yelling about conflicting reports about

01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:50.660
David Knight.

01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:51.660
Totally.

01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:52.660
Totally.

01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:57.660
Just because he's petty and he's angry and wants to save face about firing old Greybeard.

01:39:57.660 --> 01:39:58.660
Oh man.

01:39:58.660 --> 01:39:59.660
I don't know.

01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:00.660
It's weird.

01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:06.920
I still am not convinced 100% that it was Steve but like his performance makes me think

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:07.920
it was.

01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:08.920
Yeah.

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:09.920
Yeah.

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:10.920
Yeah.

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:11.920
And that's not good.

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:12.920
If I was 50-50 now I'm at 70-30.

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:16.360
But every time he denies it it goes up 10%.

01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:17.420
You know?

01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:18.420
That kind of thing.

01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:19.420
Yeah.

01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:20.420
Yeah.

01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:23.820
And I guess it can't be financial because if Alex is doing this it would require the

01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:24.820
crew.

01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:25.820
Yeah.

01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:26.820
That would be there for David anyway.

01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:27.820
Yeah.

01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:30.940
So I guess salary if David Knight was making a bunch.

01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:31.940
I don't know.

01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:32.940
Yeah.

01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:33.940
I don't trust.

01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:34.940
I don't trust any of this shit.

01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:38.740
Well I mean Corsi whenever we found out how much fucking money he was making.

01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:39.740
Yeah.

01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:40.740
But he had juice.

01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:41.740
Yeah that's true.

01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:42.740
Corsi was a name.

01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:43.740
Corsi was a name.

01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:45.980
But Knight had a long career there.

01:40:45.980 --> 01:40:52.060
I assume he hopefully got a 3% a 3% raise every year.

01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:54.740
I bet he started in 2009 at 5.15 an hour.

01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:56.540
Give him a cola at least.

01:40:56.540 --> 01:40:57.540
No benefits.

01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:58.540
Cost of living man.

01:40:58.540 --> 01:40:59.540
No no no.

01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:00.540
No insurance.

01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:03.940
There's a soda machine in the break room.

01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:06.500
I yeah I don't know.

01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:09.740
I would assume it's so hard to say.

01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:13.420
I always think like man they must be getting paid a lot because this is degrading work.

01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:14.420
Totally.

01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:18.220
But I think if you're in you realize you can't go anywhere else.

01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:19.220
Sure.

01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:20.220
Now David Knight could.

01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:23.940
Like we said he could go to Newsmax or OAN really easily and probably get a decent contract.

01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:24.940
Sure.

01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:29.520
But 2010, 2011 there wasn't anywhere that David Knight could go.

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:31.900
Maybe the blaze but that didn't exist that whole thing.

01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:32.900
No no no.

01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:35.980
He was once he once he walked in the door he was stuck for a while.

01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:36.980
Yeah.

01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:42.180
And David Knight so he wasn't going to cause enough problems elsewhere to justify a firing

01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:44.860
until Steve Pajitnik says something batshit.

01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:45.860
Yeah.

01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:46.860
And he's like guys.

01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:47.860
Another thing that was batshit.

01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:49.740
We can't do this.

01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:50.940
This is my final straw.

01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:54.200
And it kind of makes you think because David Knight was saying that like the last straw

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:56.980
for him and Steve was the Las Vegas shooting.

01:41:56.980 --> 01:41:57.980
Yeah.

01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:00.620
And after that Steve didn't appear on Alex's show for quite a while.

01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:01.620
Right right right right.

01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:04.980
So it makes you think that maybe Alex listened to him at that point.

01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:05.980
Yeah.

01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:10.540
And since David was the one who was being like look this is really fucked up.

01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:11.540
Well I mean.

01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:12.540
We can't allow him to.

01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:15.940
We do know that David has told him not to have certain people on in the past.

01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:17.740
I know I heard Alex complain about that.

01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:18.740
Exactly.

01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:19.740
Yeah yeah yeah.

01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:20.740
He was very offended.

01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:21.740
Yeah.

01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:23.780
And that's why Black Lives Matter made 10.6 billion dollars.

01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:24.780
Exactly.

01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:26.220
And we had to fire David Knight.

01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:27.220
Yeah.

01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:30.860
I think this story will unravel further in the coming days.

01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:37.020
But since Alex is theoretically taking a week off that leaves us without anything for a

01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:38.020
while.

01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:41.100
So I was thinking maybe we should do a Project Camelot on Friday maybe.

01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:42.620
Ooh that might be fun.

01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:44.100
Or we'll figure out something.

01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:45.100
We'll see.

01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:49.540
I'm not gonna do a David Knight episode on Christmas Eve.

01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:50.700
No no no no no.

01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:51.700
That's not a present for anyone.

01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:55.440
I know that not everybody celebrates all the same holidays but for those who do that would

01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:56.440
be a shit present.

01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:57.440
Yeah yeah yeah.

01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:58.440
Sorry about that.

01:42:58.440 --> 01:42:59.440
Don't want to do that to you.

01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:00.440
No not interested.

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:01.440
Anyway we'll be back.

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.440
But until then we have a website.

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:03.440
We do have a website.

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:04.440
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:05.440
Yeah.

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:06.440
Or else on Twitter.

01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:07.440
We are on Twitter.

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:08.440
It's at knowledge underscore fight net.

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:09.440
Go to bed Jordan.

01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:10.440
Or else whoa whoa whoa on Facebook.

01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:11.440
We are Facebook.

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:14.460
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:15.460
doing God's work.

01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:16.460
Yeah.

01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:17.460
Or else we'll be back.

01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:18.660
But until then I'm Neo.

01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:19.660
I'm Leo.

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:20.660
I'm DZX Clark.

01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:21.660
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:23.380
I'm not ending this show because of Steve Pachannik.

01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:24.380
I swear.

01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:26.300
I swear I'm not ending this show.

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:29.740
Right now we're about to finish this show and it has nothing to do with Steve Pachannik.

01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:34.020
It just has everything to do with, look, Jordan has been tired for like the last 30 minutes

01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:35.780
or so and he wants to end the show.

01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:37.780
I would like to keep the show going.

01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:38.780
You've got to fire Jordan.

01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:40.940
I would like the show to keep going for another half hour.

01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:41.940
Replace him with Melania.

01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:44.060
But look, everybody needs a break.

01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:45.620
Jordan looks like he's gonna have a heart attack.

01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:46.620
He's ashen.

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:50.060
Anyway, finances are tight so we can't do another half hour.

01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:52.380
It has nothing to do with Steve.

01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:53.380
Andy in Kansas.

01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:54.380
You're on the air.

01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:55.380
Thanks for holding.

01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:56.380
Hello Alex.

01:43:56.380 --> 01:43:57.380
I'm a first time caller.

01:43:57.380 --> 01:43:58.380
I'm a huge fan.

01:43:58.380 --> 01:43:59.380
I love your work.

01:43:59.380 --> 01:43:59.880
I love you.
