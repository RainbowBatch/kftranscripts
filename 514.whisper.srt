Dan and Jordan, I am sweating

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,360
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,920
I have great respect for knowledgefight

knowledgefight

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,920
Shang, we are the bad guys, knowledgefight

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,080
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,880
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,320
Need, I need money

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,280
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,160
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,480
Stop it, Andy and, Andy and Kansas

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,040
It's time to pray

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,280
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,680
Hello Alex, I'm a victim caller, I'm a huge fan

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,880
I love your work

I love you

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,360
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:01,840
I'm Jordan

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
We're couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,720
Oh indeed we are, Dan

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,200
Jordan

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,680
Dan!

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,080
Jordan

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,720
I have a quick question for you

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,120
What's up?

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,080
What's your bright spot today?

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,040
My bright spot today is something I've actually told you about already

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,320
and I'd like to continue my celebration of this

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,960
and that is Rolled Gold put out a flavor of pretzels

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,000
They had two different sort of limited time flavors

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,720
One's a zesty buffalo and I dare not try that

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,160
Oh yeah, of course not

38
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,720
Of course not

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,040
But the savory butter, I tried that, is so good

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,520
So good

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,400
It's so good

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
Is it like buttered popcorn, like that feeling where you get so much butter on that

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,880
It is right here, you can experience it, but don't chew into the mic

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,360
I will attempt to

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,520
Don't chew into the mic, I would like to get your reaction

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,680
It's so good

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,640
It's like a real, it's like a harsh butter

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,080
It's a lot of butter

49
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,440
It is a lot of butter

50
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:53,840
Yeah

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,280
It is maybe too much butter for me, but it is, it's good

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, it's good

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
It's good, I have eaten half of one and I am full

54
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,680
You're done

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
It's very, very heavy

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,560
Yeah, I expected it to be like an almost non-existent flavor

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,200
Yeah, yeah

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,680
Like just a little suggestion of butter or something, but nah, it's in your face

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,280
Well done Rolled Gold

61
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,240
No, when we were talking about this, I was like, oh, this sounds like a flavor-blasted goldfish

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,880
Yeah

63
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,200
That is exactly what it tastes like, it tastes like a regular rolled gold pretzel

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,240
And then they were like, what if we just covered it in shit?

65
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,120
What if we just

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,040
Just doused it

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,600
With butter

68
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,080
It does feel injected with butter

69
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,640
So what about you?

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,080
My bright spot this day is actually the original Final Fantasy VII

71
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,280
Ooh, not the remake

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,120
No, on Christmas they had like a half-off special, so it was like five bucks

73
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,160
So I was like, screw it

74
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,400
And I started playing it again, and I am so happy I did

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,280
And I'm happy that I did it after the remake, too

76
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,560
Is because once I got out of Midgar, I felt the same way I did the first time I played it

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,640
Which was just, oh, thank Christ, I'm out of that fucking place

78
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,240
Yeah, that's the feeling, I guess, the game wants you to feel

79
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,800
Totally

80
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
The moment you leave Midgar and you can see the entire world in front of you

81
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
And it shows you the world map, you're like, oh my god, I thought it was all gonna be in Midgar

82
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,920
Like, remake is great

83
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,240
Yeah

84
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,880
It's really great

85
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,280
But it's all there

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,400
But it's all in Midgar

87
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:16,720
Yeah, yeah

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,080
Like the moment you escape and you're like, it's just amazing

89
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,440
It really is beautiful

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,160
Well, you make a strong case for me to give that game a shot, and I may in the future

91
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,320
It's great, it really is just fucking great

92
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,960
I may, it's definitely a big blind spot for me, it's pretty much all of the Final Fantasy series

93
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,360
Yeah

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,000
Except for the remake, which you made me play, and I enjoyed

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,880
You did enjoy, right?

96
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,440
Yeah, yeah

97
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,080
That was pretty good

98
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,720
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying that

99
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,520
That is fantastic

100
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Good way to end, wrap up the year for you

101
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,240
Absolutely

102
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,480
So, we did not have an episode on Friday

103
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,320
And I'm gonna say, I think it's probably good that we didn't

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,160
I hope everyone, you know, celebrates Christmas, had a nice Christmas

105
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,000
Everybody celebrates other holidays

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,600
Have a great holiday time

107
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,760
Or if you just don't celebrate anything, hope you had a good weekend

108
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,920
I felt it would be emotionally draining for us to do an episode on Friday

109
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,800
That was covering what Alex was doing

110
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,120
Yeah

111
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,960
And that was not taking his week off that he said he was going to take

112
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,200
Yeah, the week he said he was going to take off, instead he did not take off

113
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,800
He did not take off, and uh, because kind of just not having a fun time

114
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,960
Not surprising

115
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Um, I didn't watch all of his content

116
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,160
Turns out firing everybody made it very hard for me to take a day off

117
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,720
Whoops, my only friend is Harrison Smith

118
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,360
This sucks

119
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,160
I'm fucked

120
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,760
Yeah, um, I thought that there would be a little bit of schadenfreude in it

121
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,160
I think there would be a little bit of us wallowing around in the mud watching a guy be miserable

122
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,280
It'd be great, yeah

123
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
I mean, there's some fun to that

124
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
We like watching Alex be miserable

125
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,080
I know, but we did that already

126
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,800
That's true

127
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,040
We already did that with the first American Journal episode

128
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,720
Yeah, that's true, that is true, there is that

129
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,440
It just felt almost repetitive and not like it was going to bring anything new to the table

130
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,120
And I worried that once we came to Monday, what would we have to cover?

131
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,520
Totally

132
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,200
Like maybe there would be a Project Camelot episode we could have done for Friday

133
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,200
But if Alex actually had taken that week off, we'd need that for Monday

134
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,520
True

135
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,160
Or whatever

136
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,960
Could have been dangerous

137
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah, and so it left me kind of in a lurch of what to do

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,680
And so, you know, we took that break and here we are back on Monday

139
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,560
And I think that this is going to be a slightly different episode

140
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,520
Because we're just going to be covering a special report that Alex put out

141
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,080
Okay

142
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,240
And he put it out on Christmas

143
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,320
There's hatchet throwing that's implied

144
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,560
Implied hatchet throwing? Ah, that's a little disappointing

145
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,600
Yeah, no, there's no hatchet throwing

146
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,160
I need explicit hatchet throwing to get the fuck out

147
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,480
No, nothing shall ever top 2018 Christmas Eve

148
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,440
No, that's too good

149
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,040
Um, we are going to be talking on this episode about

150
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,920
Alex's immediate response to the bombing in Nashville

151
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,480
Right

152
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,040
That's going to be what we take a little time to discuss on this episode

153
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,480
Because I think it's, you know, it's in that vein of things that I think are really important

154
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,920
to understand about Alex

155
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,480
And as we go into 2021

156
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,680
I'm Dan, this is 2021

157
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,400
Oh, yay!

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,880
Now I'm confused

159
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,840
I'll have to figure something out for actual 2021

160
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,480
How's that one? That's my new catchphrase

161
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,200
I'm into it

162
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,800
That's the demon coming through the portal

163
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,000
Exactly, yeah, yeah

164
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,560
Um, I feel like as we get into that year

165
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,960
One of the things I really want to stress and really want to redouble my efforts on

166
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,600
Is looking at these things that like are really actually important about Alex

167
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,080
Yeah, okay

168
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,480
It's always fun to make fun of him breaking down in the studio

169
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:30,880
Sure

170
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,520
Always fun

171
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,000
Sure

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,480
Always fun to laugh at like Alex with guns

173
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:34,800
Right

174
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,280
But those are things that are almost trivial in a certain way

175
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,200
Right, we do still have a job to do

176
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,520
Right

177
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,800
And I think that this is part of that

179
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,120
This is part of like looking back at that focus

180
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah

181
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,200
And so we'll get down to business on that

182
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,920
But before we do, I'd like to take a moment to say thank you to the folks

183
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,520
Some folks who've signed up and are supporting the show

184
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,240
Great idea

185
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,000
So first, Amber Z, thank you so much

186
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,360
You are now a policy wonk

187
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,400
I'm a policy wonk

188
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,520
Thanks, Amber

189
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,960
Next, Josh O, thank you so much

190
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,000
You are now a policy wonk

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,120
I'm a policy wonk

192
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,840
Thank you, Josh

193
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,240
Thank you

194
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,000
Next, Bry F, thank you so much

195
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,200
You are now a policy wonk

196
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,400
I'm a policy wonk

197
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,200
Thanks, Bry

198
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,560
Next, Amanda M, thank you so much

199
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,840
You are now a policy wonk

200
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,800
I'm a policy wonk

201
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,000
Thank you very much, Amanda

202
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,480
Thank you

203
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,160
No Last Initial Lindsay

204
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,640
Thank you so much

205
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,920
You are now a policy wonk

206
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,880
I'm a policy wonk

207
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,920
Thank you very much

208
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,120
Lindsay Lohan

209
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,440
Could be

210
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,400
Until mentioned otherwise

211
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,640
Yeah, until we prove it's not

212
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,560
The star of Herbie Fully Loaded

213
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,840
Lindsay Lohan

214
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,360
We got parrot trapped, Dad

215
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,880
Next, Emma M, thank you so much

216
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,160
You are now a policy wonk

217
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,120
I'm a policy wonk

218
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,840
Thanks, Emma

219
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,840
Thank you! Next, Nick S. Nick S, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

220
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
I'm a policy wonk!

221
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,840
Thank you very much, Nick.

222
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Thank you! And then finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on Elevated Love and we appreciate that very much.

223
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,840
So, Pyrae, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat, and I say this with disdain, you are now a technocrat.

224
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
I'm a policy wonk.

225
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,840
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic. Have yourself a brew.

226
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,840
How's your 401k doing, bro?

227
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,840
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

228
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,840
Let's just get down to business. We ain't making that money off that heroin.

229
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,840
Why you pimps so good? My neck is freakishly large. I declare info war on you.

230
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Thank you so much, Pyrae, and thank you so much, I say this with disdain.

231
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

232
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
If you're out there listening and thinking, hey, I enjoy this show, I'd like to support these gents,

233
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,840
you can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com, clicking the button that says support the show, we would appreciate it, or...

234
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:26,840
Or what you could do, if you are feeling like your generous spirit is oppressed by a massive global corporation,

235
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,840
literally sucking the life from the planet, then what you should do is escape from that place,

236
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:40,840
take your generosity to, I don't know, Junin, and then give it to a local charity or bail fund in, specifically, Junin.

237
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Sounds good.

238
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
I would say so.

239
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Alright, so, Jordan, I have a special report for you here, released on Christmas.

240
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:56,840
I've not cut anything out of the special report that Alex is playing, except for one point where he plays the audio of the bomb going off in Nashville.

241
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,840
It doesn't really add anything interesting to the episode to hear an explosion, and the audio mix is terrible, it is so loud.

242
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
It would just blow out people's ears.

243
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,840
It does make me think of that Bill Cooper episode, though, the day after the Oklahoma City bombing.

244
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,840
In that episode, Bill made a point to play the audio of the explosion, and there's kind of echoes here,

245
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,840
except for Bill was doing it dramatically.

246
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Bill played it repeatedly, and kind of almost like a chorus, and then he would say something in the middle.

247
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,840
It was a call and response to the bomb.

248
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,840
Alex just plays it, and it's very loud.

249
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,840
All I've done here is I've just cut every time it's clear that Alex is doing a different take.

250
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,840
Because, you know, the audio shifts slightly, and you can tell that Alex just ran out of steam, and they're like,

251
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,840
So he did a couple of takes? Well, that's better than we've seen in the past.

252
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,840
True, true. Let's do another sentence. Try another sentence, Alex.

253
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Yeah, try it one more time.

254
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,840
I get the sense he was recording from home, so maybe his wife is a better producer than Rob Dew.

255
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,840
You can't say that!

256
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
Oh, God damn it, honey.

257
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,840
So here's where we start. Here's the beginning.

258
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Today, in the early morning hours of Christmas, a large truck bomb housed inside an RV

259
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,840
exploded outside the AT&T main communications building in Nashville.

260
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,840
The individual, organization, or group behind the attack went out of their way

261
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,840
to warn the public to get away before the bomb detonated by broadcasting for more than ten minutes

262
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,840
that there was a bomb on board the vehicle that was about to detonate.

263
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,840
911 also received a call claiming that gunshots had been fired in the area minutes before the explosion.

264
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,840
The FBI is now reporting that human remains have been found in the debris at the blast site.

265
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,840
So you can already tell those are multiple takes?

266
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:49,840
Yeah, the 911 cut was almost Paul Joseph Watson-esque, of coming in before the breath is finished.

267
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,840
The hole was cut in the middle of a sentence, though.

268
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Yeah, so infuriating. I hate it.

269
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,840
So on Christmas Day, in case people did not hear about this,

270
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,840
a bomb was detonated in an RV parked in downtown Nashville.

271
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,840
At the time of our recording, one of the working theories that people have

272
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,840
is that it's possible that the person was targeting the AT&T building,

273
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,840
which was quite nearby the blast site.

274
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,840
This, as a possible motive for an act of domestic terror, makes complete sense.

275
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,840
If you were going to go through the trouble of carrying out a bombing,

276
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,840
you would likely want whatever damage you do to have maximum impact.

277
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,840
AT&T's operations in Nashville are housed at that building,

278
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,840
so the potential disruption you could cause by damaging that would be huge,

279
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,840
as we've seen from the fallout of the bombing itself,

280
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,840
with some people still being without phone service today as we're recording.

281
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
This is all a very tragic turn of events,

282
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,840
and my heart goes out to the people affected by this act.

283
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,840
Thankfully, there weren't any civilian casualties,

284
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,840
and the human remains that were found there,

285
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
literally right before we started recording,

286
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,840
I saw it was being reported that they have matched the DNA

287
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,840
to the person they suspect is the bomber.

288
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
There's a lot of stuff that's on my own still about this event,

289
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,840
but there are definitely some fair assumptions you can make about it.

290
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Obviously, this wasn't an accident, so there was an intention behind this bombing.

291
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,840
It was clearly meant to be a spectacle and something that would be traumatic,

292
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
given that it was planned for Christmas morning,

293
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,840
which is a very solemn time for many in this country.

294
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,840
My gut tells me, based on these pieces of information,

295
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
that this was an ideological act.

296
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,840
But who knows what that ideology is at this point?

297
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,840
Right. I mean, it's unfortunate that the vibe I'm getting from this whole thing

298
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,840
is Vietnamese monks self-immolating,

299
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:36,840
but because they believe that the Laotians are going to sneak in through the earth,

300
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,840
where it's like, yes, you are making a statement.

301
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,840
This is a problem, though. This is an issue.

302
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,840
I'm not sure I quite follow what you're saying.

303
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
5G isn't going to hurt anyone. Do you know what I'm saying?

304
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
Well, but I don't know if that's the motivation either.

305
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
No, no, no, totally.

306
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
That's making an assumption there.

307
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,840
No, of course. That's why I said the vibe I'm getting,

308
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,840
not like, I know for a fact that this is why you did that.

309
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,840
But that's the general feeling that people are passing around.

310
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,840
Some people are speculating on that.

311
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:12,840
What I'm trying to clearly delineate here is the idea of what is responsible speculation and what is not.

312
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
Oh, totally.

313
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,840
Speculating that this was motivated by some sort of an ideology

314
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,840
based on the actions, the circumstances, responsible speculation.

315
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Sure.

316
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Claiming that you know exactly what it is or choosing what you want the target you think it might have been.

317
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Sure.

318
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
And then why would they do that?

319
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Sure.

320
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
That's not great.

321
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
No, totally.

322
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
That's not grounded.

323
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,840
And I think that, you know, I see that possibility.

324
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Yeah, sure.

325
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,840
It could turn out that more information comes out and he was someone who was worried about 5G.

326
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,840
Yeah, no, I don't know by any stretch.

327
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,840
And nor am I making a claim that that's what's going on by any means.

328
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:02,840
But from what I understand so far, it does have that feeling of somebody who is,

329
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,840
I guess, sacrificing their own life for something they believe in.

330
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,840
And chances are, if you're going after AT&T.

331
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,840
And if you unpack that a little bit more, you're still making a giant assumption.

332
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Oh no, I'm making a massive assumption.

333
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Yeah.

334
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,840
And I don't think that, you know, that is substantiated yet.

335
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
100% agree.

336
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,840
It could in the future, and again, this is the issue with the wet concrete.

337
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
Right.

338
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,840
You gotta respect the wet concrete until it dries because otherwise you just fuck it up.

339
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
Yeah, totally.

340
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,840
It's a point that I've made a lot in that Alex Jones knows that his business model really only works

341
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
and is powered by uncertainty.

342
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,840
The moment that the cement is wet and he can write his initials on there before it dries,

343
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,840
that is the time he knows he has to go to work.

344
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,840
And naturally, on Christmas Day, when he's already failing to take this week off,

345
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,840
he records a special report about the Nashville bombing because on some possibly subconscious level,

346
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,840
he knows that if he waits until his show on Sunday, there's a chance that more details will be known by then

347
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,840
and it'll be too late for him to profit off this tragedy.

348
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,840
We watch this unfold in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing,

349
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,840
and it seems kinda likely that this is gonna be another big push for him now.

350
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

351
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,840
A couple of things are different, though, which make the end of 2020 a lot more complicated for someone like Alex.

352
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,840
For one, there are tons of people running around online competing for access to that wet cement.

353
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,840
Alex doesn't have exclusive control over the paranoid conspiracy space anymore,

354
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:31,840
so there are other people who are equally able to put their imprint on stories before the information becomes public.

355
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,840
The other major difference is that people keep suing Alex now.

356
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,840
In the past, he was a lunatic yelling that everyone just thought, eh, it's best to leave him alone.

357
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,840
But he went too far, and finally some people stood up to his bullying.

358
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,840
That had a domino effect of people not being afraid to burden him with lawsuits when he defames them.

359
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,840
And that has a chilling effect on someone's ability to defame people freely.

360
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
It should.

361
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
Yeah.

362
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:59,840
So now Alex knows that there are some limitations to what he legally can speculate about without consequences.

363
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Alex knows that, you know, that this is just the reality of his life.

364
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:08,840
Meanwhile, these other people who want to get access to that wet cement, they're mostly anonymous weirdos online.

365
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,840
They're operating fake-named alias QAnon accounts.

366
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,840
They don't have to worry about being sued because they're essentially internet phantoms.

367
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,840
They aren't bound by the same fear of consequence that Alex has,

368
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:25,840
so they're free to speculate and craft conspiracies in ways Alex is not, but he used to be.

369
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Yeah, and he can't direct it.

370
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:37,840
He now has to, if something gets too popular, he has to assimilate it instead of being able to kind of push the narrative in any direction that he would prefer.

371
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,840
Now he's getting pushed.

372
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,840
Well, I think even in the past it was even more complicated that he was assimilating and pushing simultaneously.

373
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
Sure, sure, sure.

374
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:53,840
You know, co-opting hot online trends and then making them, you know, match the Info Wars narrative.

375
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
It's too obvious now.

376
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:03,840
Well, that's the thing. He could straddle the line between the part of the internet that nobody goes on anymore

377
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:09,840
and then come back to the real world as being that kind of almost bridge between them.

378
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,840
And now the crazy part is the main internet, so what are you going to do?

379
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,840
Yeah, it's all over the place.

380
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,840
Yeah, it's a mess.

381
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,840
It's great stuff. I think we're doing awesome.

382
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:26,840
So that's one of the reasons why I decided if we're doing this episode it'd probably be good to talk about Alex's immediate response.

383
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Because that's the concrete wet moment, let's see what he can do in this new Info War battle space.

384
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Because it's different now. The elements have changed from when he would be able to be the king of the roost.

385
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Yeah, and it'll be interesting to see how the story changes tomorrow, and we'll have to do a completely different episode.

386
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,840
Sure, but it's still important to check in on this.

387
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
Totally.

388
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,840
So here Alex goes on.

389
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Who would have a motive to carry out an attack like this?

390
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,840
Could it be a former employee or engineer angry at AT&T?

391
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:09,840
Could it be an organization or group, a terrorist organization, angry at AT&T for their politics for surveilling the public?

392
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,840
Or perhaps owning the propaganda outlet CNN?

393
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,840
Rest assured, these are the first questions that FBI and ATF agents are asking right now on the ground in Tennessee.

394
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:27,840
So if you notice, the two possibilities that Alex provides for potential entities with a motive seem to imply that he's sympathetic to the bombing.

395
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
Yeah! Yeah!

396
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,840
It's immediately like, maybe it's someone who's mad that AT&T spies on everybody illegally.

397
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,840
Like, that's weird. That's really weird.

398
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,840
I mean, I can see it.

399
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:47,840
No, no, all the reasons. I'm not saying those with the same glee he kind of seems to have as to like,

400
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,840
here are the reasons that I would bomb AT&T is kind of what he's saying.

401
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,840
Yeah, that's the feeling that it gives.

402
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Wait, what? AT&T owns CNN? That's why? That's what you've decided?

403
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
This is weird.

404
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Let's think of the reasonable reasons to bomb AT&T off the top of my head, the ones that I appreciate.

405
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
CNN, obviously.

406
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Yeah, it's got to be CNN.

407
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:17,840
It's just strange to me that immediately, as this special report opens, the options that he's presenting for why the person did what they did,

408
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,840
like their motivation, are identical beliefs to his.

409
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

410
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
That's strange.

411
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
Totally.

412
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,840
He's identifying with and sympathizing with the actor in this case.

413
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,840
Maybe he blew up AT&T because they own Brian Stelter. I don't know.

414
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Maybe they specifically chose Brian. Was there a note that said,

415
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,840
Brian Stelter looks like a pedophile? Because I feel like that might tie back to me somehow.

416
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Stelter may come up later.

417
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
Of course he does.

418
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:50,840
So, Alex, he's planted this kernel of like AT&T owns CNN, and so then he goes from there.

419
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:59,840
In the summer of 2018, CNN deployed a new talking point that was then adopted by almost every other cable news

420
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:07,840
or broadcast news organization in the United States that Donald Trump, by criticizing the press's attacks on him,

421
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,840
was going to trigger terrorist attacks on their facilities and the murder of journalists.

422
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,840
They hammered it hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times with no proof.

423
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:26,840
So what's going on now is that Alex is trying to implant the idea that CNN said Trump's rhetoric would lead to a rise in attacks on journalists

424
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:33,840
in preparation for this Christmas Day RV bomb against AT&T's Nashville headquarters since AT&T owns CNN,

425
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,840
even though everyone knows that the CNN center is in Atlanta. This is stupid.

426
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:46,840
Yeah, I think there have already been plenty of other examples you could point to of their saying that rhetoric increases violence.

427
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Oh yeah, or you could just go check out the US Press Freedom Tracker, which is a little service that documents attacks on journalists in the United States.

428
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:01,840
In 2018, there were 35. In 2019, 34. Little progress, one less. In 2020, there have been 274.

429
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
I feel like that's a jump.

430
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Yeah. Some of this is civilians assaulting the press, but a considerable chunk are police carrying out these assaults.

431
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,840
So surprising!

432
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:18,840
It's hard not to see this kind of ripple effect as being part of Trump's rhetoric, where he labels the press the enemy of the people

433
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,840
and also constantly talks about how police, you know, if they rough people up, they shouldn't get in trouble.

434
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
That's great!

435
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,840
If I were a cop, I think I might get the sense that the president is trying to subtly tell me to hit a journalist, and he'll look the other way.

436
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,840
Yeah. It's a good thing that not all mayors agree. Oh no, all mayors agree that you should hit people. That's great.

437
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:43,840
Anyway, there's no need for an RV bomb at the AT&T building to pay off the fears that Trump's rhetoric would lead to a rise in danger for journalists.

438
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,840
That argument could be easily made without it.

439
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:58,840
So this doesn't even really satisfy in terms of like, oh, so you're going back two years to something that you yelled about about CNN being the predictive element of...

440
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,840
That's really thin.

441
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:07,840
If you go back to the MIAC report, you can see that there has been no right-wing violence since then, and that thing was crazy.

442
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Yeah, thankfully I exposed it.

443
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I saved everybody.

444
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,840
Thankfully, Alex is a careful man, so he wants to make a quick clarification.

445
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,840
To be crystal clear, InfoWars is not saying that CNN is behind the attacks.

446
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:31,840
What we are saying is a known fact that they are the main mouthpiece of the criminal elements of the deep state and shadow government that are battling to recapture control of the United States.

447
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:40,840
So the clarification is that Alex isn't saying that CNN is behind the bombing, just that they're a mouthpiece for the evil demon globalists who are trying to salvage control of the country.

448
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,840
If you're following his point, he's saying that he doesn't want CNN to sue him.

449
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
No.

450
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,840
His theory is that the evil globalists carried out the bombing to retain control of the United States.

451
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
Sounds right.

452
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,840
And CNN set the stage for it by saying Trump's rhetoric was a danger to journalists.

453
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,840
Thank you for clarifying that it was not CNN who was behind the bombing.

454
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,840
It seems like they're still in on it based on your theory.

455
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,840
A RICO case could probably get him, but I don't think they're behind it, Dan.

456
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:16,840
In this next clip, we see another characteristic of Alex's bullshit, and that is the, you know, we've seen this in pretty much every single thing that he calls a false flag.

457
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,840
He's like, well, there's a chance it's real. Maybe. Tiny.

458
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,840
But he likes the reasons the bomber may have done it.

459
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,840
There's a one percent chance it's real, that kind of thing. He says that with everything.

460
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:32,840
It is entirely possible that a lone wolf or small group carried this operation out for other reasons.

461
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:42,840
But when you look at the history and the motive and the background, and who stands to gain from this, and all the media pre-conditioning and programming, this thing reeks as a possible deep state false flag operation.

462
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,840
So it's a possible deep state false flag operation at this point.

463
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,840
That's nice. That's nice.

464
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
Let's wait till three minutes later in the special report.

465
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,840
I was going to say, the suing does seem to have a chilling effect on the first statement.

466
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,840
I don't know how well it carries over to statements two and following.

467
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,840
Yeah, yeah. It takes you longer to get into it.

468
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

469
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840
You gotta warm up to the...

470
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,840
It's almost like if you say it first, then the rest of them don't count, you know?

471
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,840
Like I said this the first time, so you know that I still mean it on the other ones.

472
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

473
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,840
So this is really the main thrust, I believe, of what he's saying.

474
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Is that two years ago, CNN did all this shit, showing it's proof that they were planning to do this now. Which is weird.

475
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:34,840
In August and October of 2018, I went to the airwaves to desperately warn the people

476
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:42,840
that MSM was clearly preconditioning the population to accept that when terror attacks that they said were imminent

477
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,840
hit mainstream media, that it was indeed the fault of whatever patsy they produced

478
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,840
who would then take credit for Donald Trump, the nationalist and populist movement.

479
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,840
I had seen this exact same rhetoric before, right before the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing

480
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,840
that was then blamed on the Patriot movement and Rush Limbaugh.

481
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
Right, so...

482
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,840
Well, had they not done it, I don't think we would have blamed them for it.

483
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,840
Well, there is that matter.

484
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,840
You're not going to get anywhere with Alex on that line of thinking.

485
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,840
Yeah, I don't think I'm going to win that one.

486
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,840
I don't see the connective tissue here. Even as a conspiracy, I think this is soft.

487
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,840
This is really soft.

488
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:32,840
I think the softest part of it is you are telling me that CNN is a multi-billion dollar a year corporation

489
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:38,840
and they spent two years planning this bombing, this bombing.

490
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:44,840
I feel like the hardest part to plan about this was the AV system that shouted,

491
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,840
there's a bomb coming!

492
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,840
It doesn't make sense.

493
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,840
In terms of timing, in terms of motive, in terms of method...

494
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,840
I guess CNN did finally win the war on Christmas. Is that what he's going for?

495
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,840
If Alex's whole thing is that these false flags are supposed to create shock and terror and horror,

496
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,840
then why would there be a warning to get away from it?

497
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Wouldn't the globalists want to kill people? They don't care about human life.

498
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,840
That doesn't make any sense. This doesn't match any of his M.O.'s.

499
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:26,840
You know what it felt like listening to this? It's just trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.

500
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,840
It just doesn't work. This is grim.

501
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,840
I think this one might be just too confusing to make a good conspiracy theory out of.

502
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Confusing can be done.

503
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,840
It can be done.

504
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,840
It requires finesse. It requires a little bit of trying.

505
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Alex is not ready to try anymore.

506
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,840
There's a certain part of this one that's just so fucking...

507
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,840
Everyone is not scared. Everyone is kind of scratching their head going like,

508
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Why?

509
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,840
I think people are scared, and rightfully.

510
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
You think so?

511
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,840
I think it's a very traumatic event.

512
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
Oh, totally.

513
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,840
I think some people were hurt. It caused a lot of destruction.

514
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:24,840
I don't think that it scares people in the same way some other, much more casualty events have.

515
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,840
But I do still think that people see something like that and are scared.

516
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,840
No, I apologize for minimizing the feelings of the people who are directly affected by it.

517
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,840
I meant more the people who would be affected by the conspiracy theories.

518
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,840
Obviously, I'm not going to be like,

519
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,840
Eh, whatever. You got blown up. No big deal.

520
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:50,840
This, though, is such a thing where all of these Q conspiracies and all of this stuff seem to be swirling together.

521
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,840
But even then, the traction is just more like,

522
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,840
I guess we got to wait until we find out why the guy actually did it.

523
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,840
This one seems tough on Alex. It seems like he's, I don't know,

524
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,840
The way I would describe it is he's trying to walk a little bit fast outside a pool.

525
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,840
His feet are wet.

526
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
Holding scissors.

527
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
He's just worried about slipping.

528
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,840
You know, it doesn't have traction.

529
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,840
It doesn't.

530
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,840
It doesn't.

531
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
It doesn't.

532
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
No.

533
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
It's a weird one.

534
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,840
This is a really weird situation.

535
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,840
So now we reach the point in the special report, which is maybe like 20 seconds after he said maybe it's real,

536
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,840
where he definitively says that it was the deep state.

537
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,840
Okay.

538
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,840
Within days of the Supreme Court of Michigan declaring that Governor Whitmer was nothing more than a dictator

539
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840
and that her COVID lockdowns were illegal,

540
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,840
suddenly the FBI busted a terror cell of militia that had been playing to kidnap her.

541
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:50,840
It came out a week later that the terror cell was led by two FBI informants

542
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,840
and the whole thing had been a giant setup.

543
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:58,840
That is a smaller microcosm of what the deep state does when they actually carry out larger terror attacks

544
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,840
like we just witnessed in Nashville, Tennessee.

545
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,840
Oh boy.

546
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,840
So to be clear, I'm not taking Alex out of context at all.

547
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,840
No, that one pretty much says it.

548
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
He's not spitballing.

549
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
He's not asking questions.

550
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,840
He just literally said that the Tennessee bombing was carried out by the deep state.

551
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,840
It's in the context of his meaningless rambling, but it's still a definite statement.

552
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,840
He's not suggesting it's possible that the deep state did this.

553
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,840
He's explicitly arrived at that conclusion.

554
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,840
And that is being put to the audience.

555
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Also, the Michigan Supreme Court did not declare Whitmer a tyrant

556
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,840
and that was not a fake kidnapping plot.

557
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,840
No, no, no it was not.

558
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,840
You're going to look me in the eye and tell me that the devil said to these people,

559
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Hey, no death.

560
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Yeah, yeah, that's part of the devil's trickiness.

561
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,840
Hey, listen, minor injuries only.

562
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:56,840
So you might be asking like, what, why, you know?

563
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,840
I would be asking myself that.

564
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,840
What does the globalist gain through this?

565
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
What do the globalists gain?

566
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
Agreed.

567
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,840
This country is in an existential battle fighting for its very existence

568
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,840
against a chai comm led globalist takeover.

569
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,840
And with 25 days until the attempted installment and coronation

570
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,840
of their agent, Joe Biden, the mainstream media is on the ropes.

571
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
People hate them.

572
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,840
They don't believe them.

573
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
They don't trust them.

574
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,840
And as massive evidence comes out of collective election fraud carried

575
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,840
by the deep state and their cohorts, the Democratic Party,

576
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,840
the system needs something to turn themselves into victims.

577
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,840
This is designed to silence the American people and their opposition

578
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,840
to the great reset and the huge COVID lockdown.

579
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,840
Really?

580
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
That is meant to be permanent if Joe Biden gets into power.

581
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
This just seems-

582
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
I just don't buy it.

583
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
No.

584
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
No.

585
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
No.

586
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
This is stupid.

587
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Isn't it strange, though, like how uninspiring, uninspired this is?

588
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
Yeah.

589
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
Just like-

590
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

591
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,840
Really?

592
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
Yeah.

593
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,840
Come on, man.

594
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,840
That was to make the globalists look like victims?

595
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,840
What is that?

596
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
That doesn't even make sense.

597
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
That doesn't fit what's going on at all.

598
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,840
No.

599
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,840
You know, like if this was the Boston bombing,

600
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,840
then you can sell me on something like that.

601
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
But this is just so different.

602
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
It's just so different.

603
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,840
And you can't say the same thing about something that's this different.

604
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,840
And what I don't understand is like the Christmas angle isn't even in it for us.

605
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
Yeah, right?

606
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
There's no attack on Christmas.

607
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
There's no war on Christmas.

608
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,840
Oh, that seems so easy.

609
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
It's deep in his rhetoric.

610
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
He thinks there's a war on Christmas.

611
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,840
There's a literal bombing on Christmas.

612
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Yeah, but I think he's still of the opinion that when it comes out,

613
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,840
the full story, it's going to be somebody more on the,

614
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,840
I hate the people who have the war on Christmas side.

615
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,840
So he probably thinks preemptively, I don't know if I can pull that one off.

616
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,840
That may be. That may be.

617
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:52,840
All I know is that Alex is a man with a deep archive.

618
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,840
And he has great employees working for him who can pull up every time

619
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,840
that he said that false flags are coming.

620
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Sure.

621
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,840
I have been on record dozens of times in the last month saying,

622
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,840
we are now in the season of the false flag.

623
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,840
We are now in the season of the establishment loading up truck bombs

624
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,840
to bomb themselves, to be victims.

625
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,840
And I have our archivist looking for it right now.

626
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,840
But thanks to Media Matters, George Soros' organization,

627
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,840
we have two examples from two years ago where I warned and foreshadowed

628
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,840
what we now happen to see unfolding.

629
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,840
So he does not have these, I guess the archivists are working on it.

630
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

631
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
They're working on it.

632
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,840
Harrison Smith is coming in on Christmas to try and find these clips.

633
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,840
It's tough.

634
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,840
There's a lot of our episodes to go through to find those clips.

635
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,840
That's true.

636
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840
So yeah, Harrison's got to figure that out.

637
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
Yeah, yeah.

638
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,840
And instead they just Googled.

639
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
Have you got an email yet?

640
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,840
They just Googled on Media Matters.

641
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,840
And searched for times that Alex has said fucked up things.

642
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
Oh man, it's really nice of them to keep track for them.

643
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
Yeah.

644
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,840
So here is the clips that Alex plays from Media Matters of him

645
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,840
predicting what we saw.

646
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Yeah.

647
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,840
And ladies and gentlemen, this is about taking down America and Trump

648
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,840
and the recovery and the entire free press.

649
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,840
So I'm telling you, like night follows day, the stage terror attacks

650
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:18,840
are coming on big tech, government buildings, mainstream media.

651
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,840
All the stars will be gone that day.

652
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,840
All the stelters will be gone that day.

653
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,840
All the Lester Holtz will be gone.

654
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,840
And they are going to drive a truck bomb or something into a daycare

655
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,840
at CNN or ABC or something and have people shooting everybody, you name it.

656
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,840
You can see the pre-programming and say, see, the hate did this.

657
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,840
The hate did this while they cover up Antifa and the attack on Scalise

658
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,840
and the attack on Rand Paul and all the calls to kidnap Barron and rape him.

659
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,840
And we've got to get this out to Trump.

660
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
We've got to let him know because Trump's not calling for violence.

661
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,840
When they attack Trump and lie about it, he says, you're fake news.

662
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,840
You're lying.

663
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,840
I'm not a racist.

664
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
I love Mexicans, whatever.

665
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
They go, oh, you're a Nazi.

666
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
You're calling for violence.

667
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
Blood on your hands.

668
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,840
Same thing with me editing stuff out of context to build this.

669
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
They got big tech.

670
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,840
They got the media.

671
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,840
They got the Democrats.

672
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,840
They got Warner reportedly running it all ready to quarterback.

673
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,840
This whole time could happen today, tomorrow, next month.

674
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,840
But understand, here's the big emergency.

675
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,840
These are only probing attacks to shut it up and to test the public.

676
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Will they buy that Soros and Hillary and Bill and Obama and CNN are poor victims?

677
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,840
This is introducing them as the targets.

678
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,840
They can whine and moan and predict if Trump doesn't stop.

679
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,840
You're going to get us all killed.

680
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:35,840
And then in rolls that big ass truck bomb into CNN Center Atlanta.

681
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,840
Boom.

682
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,840
All the execs will be off on a special meeting that day.

683
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,840
Most of CNN crew would have never expected they'll get hit.

684
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,840
They'll even take out a large group of their top people.

685
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,840
Yeah, they're getting ready to hit themselves and hit themselves hard.

686
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,840
MSNBC, ABC, they're going to hit themselves.

687
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,840
So I have a couple of reasons why I don't take anything that Alex played there as sincere

688
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,840
or a meaningful prediction about what actually happened on Friday.

689
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,840
The first is that Alex literally says the target would be CNN Center in Atlanta.

690
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,840
And it would happen when Brian Stelter and Lester Holt aren't there because they would have advance warning.

691
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,840
Which we've seen played out.

692
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
Stelter and Holt do not work in Tennessee.

693
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Alright.

694
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:17,840
The second major reason that this rings hollow to me is that the specific of Alex mentioning a truck bomb in a daycare center,

695
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,840
that's not meaningful in terms of a prediction.

696
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,840
That's hearkening back to Oklahoma City.

697
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,840
That's very specifically a part of right wing terrorist history.

698
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

699
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,840
It's a huge part of the mythology and zeitgeist of the patriot world,

700
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,840
them being torn between celebrating Timothy McVeigh and pretending he was a patsy.

701
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:41,840
The third reason I take issue with this prediction is because these clips were from two and a half years ago.

702
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,840
This article that Alex is playing, a Media Matters clip from, is from August 2018.

703
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,840
So it just stretches any kind of credulity to imagine that the globalists are broadcasting their signals,

704
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,840
pushing the programming so hard that Alex picked up on them,

705
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,840
then waited 28 months and carried out a stage bombing that didn't kill anyone

706
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,840
at the building that's owned by CNN's parent company but isn't really associated with CNN itself.

707
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Correct.

708
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,840
This is thin soup.

709
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Yeah, I think what he should be doing, actually I think what we'll see tomorrow or Tuesday,

710
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,840
or when he starts hitting the ground rolling on this,

711
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,840
this is a practice run, right?

712
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,840
You have to call this a practice run before they actually do the real stuff.

713
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,840
You mean like the bombing?

714
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what Alex has to do.

715
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,840
I thought you meant this video is a practice run.

716
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

717
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,840
This video is him practicing trying to make a conspiracy out of this and he's whiffing.

718
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,840
And he accidentally put it, he posted it, this was his daily affirmations, he's just talking to a mirror.

719
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
It is all fake.

720
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,840
Yeah, exactly.

721
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:50,840
So that's possible, but also the fourth reason I reject this bullshit is because Alex constantly predicts false flags

722
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,840
and bombings and shit that never happens.

723
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,840
If I wanted to, I could put together a giant compilation of him doing just that.

724
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
And it turns out, I do want to.

725
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,840
How's Chicago doing? Are we a giant whole?

726
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
Well, I did want to do this actually.

727
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,840
Usually I'll just say I could do it, but I actually did it this time.

728
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:11,840
So here's a super cut of Alex making predictions of false flags coming and calling random events fake.

729
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,840
This could have been so much longer. It's six minutes.

730
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,840
It's six minutes?

731
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,840
And it could have been so much longer, but I feel like that's already trying our audience's patience.

732
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
That's way too hard.

733
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,840
Breaking in, we were following this earlier just an hour ago.

734
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,840
And the stock market was only down 600 points, which is still big.

735
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:32,840
It dropped 1600 points today, which is one of the biggest drops ever.

736
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:39,840
And then rebounded 800 points, but it's still 800 points down.

737
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Doug, you talk about deep state operations.

738
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,840
You talk about Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, they've been working against the president.

739
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,840
Even though they've had record profits, they openly cheerlead for communist China.

740
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,840
This is the type of craziness we've been saying will come.

741
00:37:52,840 --> 00:38:01,840
Evidence is mounting that the mega fires in Australia are being orchestrated by multinational forces

742
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:11,840
to clear out key corridors for future development and for light rail going in that's being financed by the communist Chinese.

743
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,840
They are intending to remove Trump one way or another.

744
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:20,840
And then they're going to trigger a civil war saying right wingers blew stuff up when Trump gets removed.

745
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,840
They're going to truck bomb and mass shoot and say we did it.

746
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,840
When they remove Trump, use that for a total clamp down.

747
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,840
The economy is going to implode.

748
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,840
There's going to be homeless running around crazy everywhere.

749
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:41,840
All they got to do is have the Chinese who supply 90 percent of the opiates cut those off for about a month.

750
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,840
And it's going to look like a zombie apocalypse.

751
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,840
And remember, oh, Alex, you're a fairmonger.

752
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,840
They'll never try to get our guns.

753
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,840
And I said, you watch.

754
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840
There's going to be mass shootings.

755
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,840
There's going to be false flags.

756
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,840
A month before Sandy Hook.

757
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:00,840
I said, this is the season. Get ready. I'm seeing them roll out the propaganda now beforehand.

758
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:06,840
And so this is the type of time you're going to see bigger false flag event type things happen.

759
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:17,840
But I can tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, that communist forces, that's what Antifa is in the Soros funded, Democrat Party funded combine,

760
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:24,840
are planning assaults on new police stations and federal buildings tonight all across the United States.

761
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:35,840
And when the Austin police bring photos and video of this to the mayor's office, they are told you are to stand down.

762
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,840
I've seen the photos. I've seen the videos. I've seen the internal memorandums.

763
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,840
This is happening for sure.

764
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,840
We knew Governor Northam was going to try to declare an emergency.

765
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,840
We knew he was going to try to hype it up like people with guns are coming to get them.

766
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,840
And so he'll have to have a law enforcement response.

767
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:59,840
Then they stage a false flag or they provocateur an action, Jesse Smollett style, but on steroids.

768
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,840
And then they say, look, the gun owners are the evil terrorists or the white supremacists.

769
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:11,840
And they run the same operation we saw the Democrat controlled state police did a couple of years ago in Charlottesville.

770
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,840
And they have launched more and more escalations.

771
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:22,840
And the next escalation is assassinating the president or staging giant terror attacks and blaming it on the right wing patriots.

772
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,840
And they're going to do it.

773
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:31,840
And are we just going to sit here while the Clintons and the Obamas load up a fuel truck again and blow up a federal building?

774
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,840
Are we just going to sit here while they go and shoot up a black church with some mental patient?

775
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:42,840
They got wound up on psychotropics and amphetamines and amnesiacs in a hotel room right now.

776
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,840
They got brainwashed loony tuners everywhere ready to go.

777
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,840
They punch a couple buttons.

778
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:56,840
It's over. There's no way to stop their false flags unless the leadership of the globalist is dealt with.

779
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,840
You know what? It's real, folks.

780
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,840
There's nothing fake here.

781
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,840
In fact, I'm so damn real, I can't stand it.

782
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
I sometimes want to control myself.

783
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,840
I sometimes want to act a different way.

784
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,840
I can't. I can't control myself.

785
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,840
I'm a maniac. It's all real. I'm totally real.

786
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,840
I've never lied to you.

787
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,840
I compulsively tell the truth.

788
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,840
And these people out there, they can't stand that, you see.

789
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
And they also don't like the fact they can't scare me.

790
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,840
And they don't like the fact they can't scare you.

791
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,840
But let me just tell you.

792
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,840
I've studied war propaganda and how the globalists do stuff.

793
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:35,840
Folks, I think they are probably...

794
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,840
I need to go to your calls, but I need to probably do a special report so I don't cut into the main broadcast time on your calls.

795
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,840
But I think they're getting ready to do a false flag and blame me and they might kill me.

796
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,840
And I'm only saying that to be dramatic.

797
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,840
And if that happens, I'm not a loser. I'm a winner.

798
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,840
I don't want to die, by the way. I'm not going to commit suicide.

799
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,840
But you know what I mean.

800
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,840
I think they could do a nuclear false flag dirty bomb or nuclear attack.

801
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,840
Oh, don't put it past them to kill Trump.

802
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,840
It takes out Trump. Exactly.

803
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:08,840
It takes out Trump. They blame it on patriots or they blame it on Trump's negotiations with North Korea.

804
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,840
They could say it's North Korea fighting back against...

805
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
Or Iran.

806
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,840
Or Iran, exactly.

807
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:17,840
But they take out Trump and they take out 200,000 Americans at the same time and then they blame conservatives.

808
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:23,840
And then they use that to blacklist all conservatives, all speech online and any dissenting views.

809
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,840
This is the plan.

810
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,840
This is the plan. They have to silence you, Alex. And they have to silence me before...

811
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:35,840
Exactly. They wouldn't be taking the risk to shut us down when it wakes everybody up with the Streisand effect if they weren't at a gut level.

812
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,840
I know. I think well before the election, they're going to hit us. And I agree.

813
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,840
I think it's going to be a biological or a nuclear event.

814
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,840
But I think they want nuclear to kill POTUS.

815
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,840
If they nuke a city which is in their plans, it's in their cards.

816
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,840
If they nuke a city and say Patriots did it, you know the hammer just dropped.

817
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,840
And they're going to try to come arrest me, you name it.

818
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,840
I know these murderers.

819
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:06,840
Just like two people are seen running away from the scene in Sandy Hook.

820
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,840
And then you find a guy shot in the head inside.

821
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,840
You go have a drill. You shoot your mental and patient patsy in the head.

822
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,840
You get out.

823
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,840
I mean this is the oldest. This is a false flag.

824
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:20,840
And so the next attack, a bioweapon ten times worse?

825
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,840
A nuke in D.C. during the State of the Union?

826
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,840
I mean Congress shouldn't be in session in the buildings.

827
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,840
The President should never be in D.C. now.

828
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,840
He should be moving around the country.

829
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,840
I mean we're in a total war, people.

830
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:39,840
And if this is proven to not be a false flag, which I think has gone from 1% chance to maybe 5% chance,

831
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,840
I will eat my hat and apologize and be very pleased.

832
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,840
Please eat your hat.

833
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,840
Yeah, please eat that hat.

834
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:51,840
Yeah, I feel like that was a little bit long, but the reason I made it that long is because I want to drive home this point.

835
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,840
Yeah.

836
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,840
The point is made.

837
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,840
I'm pretty sure it's driven home.

838
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
Yeah.

839
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,840
This is what he does.

840
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,840
This is not a prediction that Alex is making.

841
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,840
It's an obsession and a centerpiece of his worldview.

842
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:12,840
On some level, he knows that his political alignment is just full of cosplaying militia weirdos who lust after the opportunity to commit acts of violence that they can justify as being necessary

843
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,840
to water the tree of liberty or whatever.

844
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:25,840
He knows that, so the only real options he can do, he can either applaud terrorist acts, domestic terrorist acts, which is tough, or you pretend they don't exist.

845
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,840
If you go the first option, it's a little risky.

846
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:33,840
Eventually you'll end up ostracizing yourself, even from the pseudo-acceptable world of the fringe.

847
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,840
The second option just requires a mantra you drill into your audience.

848
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:44,840
In this case, if there's an act of terrorism that looks like it could have been carried out by someone who believes the same shit as me, it's fake until proven otherwise.

849
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:55,840
It's the evil nebulous group I'm fighting that's just trying to make me look bad, so ignore it and keep pushing deeper into the fanatical world that accepts, rationalizes, and excuses this kind of activity.

850
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:02,840
And that has nothing to do with what the actual end result of what this event was.

851
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,840
It doesn't matter, Alex's response is going to be to call it fake.

852
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,840
So it was always going to be a fake.

853
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,840
On the off chance that it's something that could implicate his beliefs.

854
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,840
Totally.

855
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,840
And that's just, it's very boring.

856
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,840
It is boring, and it's disheartening.

857
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,840
Yes.

858
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,840
It's really disheartening, and it's unfair.

859
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:31,840
You can set your watch by right-wing terrorism and so he gets to run interference whenever he wants because it's going to happen, you know?

860
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,840
Yeah.

861
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,840
It's so fucking annoying.

862
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:42,840
Yeah, and at its core, the narrative here, this false flag narrative, the way that Alex uses it is just a way of weaponizing and making money off denial.

863
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,840
Yep.

864
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:51,840
That's just what you're doing, and it's, like I said, when I say it's boring, I mean it's really boring when you look at it in the long view.

865
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,840
Yeah, totally.

866
00:45:52,840 --> 00:46:03,840
You look at his career and recognize all this dumb shit you keep saying is researched, I study the globalists, I know their patterns, and then every fucking pattern is wrong.

867
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,840
Nothing ends up happening that he says is going to happen.

868
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,840
And then you, but it's not boring.

869
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,840
The trick itself is not boring.

870
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,840
Right.

871
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,840
The trick itself is possibly very dangerous.

872
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,840
Yeah.

873
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:23,840
Because the first time you're exposed to the idea of a false flag and that it's not just something that only exists in fiction.

874
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,840
Sure.

875
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,840
Like, it does make you think, like, oh my god, everything could be.

876
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,840
Yeah.

877
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:32,840
And that's the danger of that tripwire Alex can set out in front of you.

878
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,840
It's the same thing that happened to Rogan.

879
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:41,840
When Rogan talks to Alex about the only things that he thinks Alex has been right about, it's like, oh, you told me that agent provocateurs exist.

880
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,840
So, like, yes, okay, great, your mind was blown by that.

881
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,840
Yeah.

882
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,840
And the mind-blowing event was used for malicious purposes.

883
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:57,840
And I think that Alex knows on some level, no matter how stupid this conspiracy is about this bombing on Christmas,

884
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:06,840
no matter how lacking in connective tissue it is, no matter how sad it looks to look at, it might blow someone's mind.

885
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,840
Yeah.

886
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:13,840
There might be someone that all they need to hear is a denial of some reality that's in their face.

887
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,840
So infuriating.

888
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,840
Yeah, you can make two bucks off that.

889
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:26,840
It's, like, the thing that weirds me out, it's so much less believable because every right-wing terror attack is a false flag.

890
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,840
You know, look, I get it, Putin won 97% of the vote.

891
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,840
Sure.

892
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,840
Sure he did.

893
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:41,840
Alright, 99% of all of these right-wing terror attacks that are people doing the things you say they should do.

894
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,840
Politically.

895
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,840
Politically.

896
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,840
99% of them are all false flags?

897
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,840
99%.

898
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,840
Come on, man.

899
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,840
And, uh...

900
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,840
At least be like the Oklahoma City bombing with him.

901
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:55,840
Well, and 99% of things that you make up that don't happen are also false flags.

902
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,840
Yeah, exactly!

903
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,840
Yes!

904
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,840
It's...

905
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,840
Come on, man!

906
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,840
Give me 60-40 at least.

907
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,840
Yeah, yeah.

908
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,840
Something.

909
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,840
It's...

910
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:09,840
But he can't muddy the waters because then you're not sure that they're all false flags.

911
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,840
Right, right.

912
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,840
You know, or you're not sure which ones are false flags.

913
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,840
Okay, and it comes down to the limitation of his abilities, and that is that once you

914
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,840
introduce the idea of, like, real critical thinking that you engage in with the audience

915
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:25,840
and allow the audience to engage in, if you're like, well, maybe this is a false flag.

916
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,840
I don't know, let's see.

917
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,840
You can't accidentally encourage your audience to start questioning and you don't want them to do that.

918
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,840
And you cannot have that.

919
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,840
Because your shit is thin.

920
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,840
Any doubt is terror.

921
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,840
It's religion.

922
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,840
Any doubt will fuck you up.

923
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,840
Yeah, yeah, and that's why Alex can say, like, there's a chance that this is real, and then

924
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,840
20 seconds later be like, the deep state did this bomb.

925
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,840
Yeah, totally, totally.

926
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,840
So you give the appearance of questioning and the appearance of critical thinking while

927
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,840
at the same time driving home your predetermined conclusion.

928
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,840
Yep.

929
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,840
It's just unfounded.

930
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,840
So unfair.

931
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,840
So, it has all the signatures, man.

932
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,840
It has all the signatures of a false flag.

933
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,840
There's a signature.

934
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,840
There's a pattern to false flags.

935
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:09,840
And at the preliminary stages, this fits perfectly into that historical paradigm.

936
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:16,840
But regardless, authoritarian elements of the system will try to use this event to take more Americans' liberties.

937
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:22,840
The Democratic Party and their deep state controllers have given us years of looting and destruction

938
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,840
as a message to the courts and the system.

939
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,840
If you don't give us what we want, if you don't let us steal the election and stall Joe Biden

940
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,840
and let China complete its takeover, we will burn every city to the ground.

941
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,840
If I were Alex, I would avoid using the word regardless.

942
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,840
Yeah.

943
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,840
Because he's like, yes, this has all the marks of a false flag, but regardless.

944
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

945
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,840
Don't hand-wave that.

946
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,840
Yeah, I don't know.

947
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,840
Makes me think that you're not saying shit.

948
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,840
Yeah.

949
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,840
Yada, yada, yada.

950
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,840
Moving on.

951
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:58,840
And he gets to, like, his closing thoughts, which is his refrain that he says on pretty

952
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:03,840
much every time he wants to say something stupid about a world event that people are

953
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,840
emotionally affected by.

954
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,840
And that is, hey, I got the right to question things.

955
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,840
Americans can question things.

956
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,840
Sure.

957
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,840
And again, this is not questioning.

958
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:19,840
But in closing, never forget the long history of governments and other organizations staging

959
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,840
false flag terror attacks to blander political opposition.

960
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:28,840
And remember, it's the American birthright to be able to research and question any public

961
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,840
event.

962
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,840
I mean, yeah, research and question whatever you want.

963
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,840
This isn't that.

964
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,840
Yeah.

965
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,840
This is bullshit.

966
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,840
That's a little bit different.

967
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,840
Yeah.

968
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,840
It is your birthright to research and question things, but it is not your birthright to go

969
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,840
on the radio and tell people that it was a false flag.

970
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,840
Right.

971
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,840
I feel like that's not a, I don't know if George Washington was hanging out being like,

972
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,840
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Eventually we're going to invent the radio.

973
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,840
I have a laissez faire.

974
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,840
I have a difficult time thinking that, I mean, first of all, I don't know.

975
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,840
I don't want to get into a first amendment debate, but I don't think it's responsible

976
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:08,840
at questioning behavior or, you know, like something that has a lot of value in society

977
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:13,840
for someone to just get on the radio and with no evidence be like the deep state did this.

978
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,840
That's stupid.

979
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,840
That can only lead to negative outcomes.

980
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,840
Yeah.

981
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:24,840
I mean, regardless of what he's saying, regardless of any of that stuff, when you say I am only

982
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,840
researching and questioning, that is a bad faith lie.

983
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,840
So I don't give a shit about what you're talking about.

984
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,840
It's a deflection.

985
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,840
I don't, this isn't even a first amendment conversation.

986
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:39,840
This is a, I can toss away your bullshit because you are already lying to me.

987
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,840
Yeah.

988
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,840
You know?

989
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,840
So fuck you.

990
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:48,840
His enclosing statement is things have happened before and I can get away with this.

991
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,840
So please give some credence to what I'm saying.

992
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:57,840
Meanwhile, the like, it's just, just, uh, just, uh, I can't even, I can't even come

993
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,840
up with words other than weak.

994
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,840
It's just nothing.

995
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,840
It's conspiracy is nothing.

996
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,840
Yeah.

997
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,840
It's so disappointing.

998
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,840
It's boring.

999
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,840
We have one last clip here as Alex closes out the report where he wants to make you

1000
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,840
afraid of Eric Holder.

1001
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,840
Damn right.

1002
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,840
Never forget that Joe Biden and his would be incoming crew of criminals are part of

1003
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,840
the Obama crime organization.

1004
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:23,840
Never forget it was deputy attorney general Eric Holder who helped cover up what really

1005
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:29,340
happened in Oklahoma city in 1995 the same holder carried out the giant confirmed false

1006
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:33,840
flag operation of fast and furious.

1007
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,120
Okay.

1008
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:42,040
Alex sounds so self-satisfied when he says fast and furious at the end there.

1009
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:46,040
Uh, I'm going to put that one in the wind column guys cut right there.

1010
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,400
Eric Holder even need talks to be in Biden's administration.

1011
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,400
Who cares?

1012
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,400
He's not.

1013
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,080
I haven't heard his name come up.

1014
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:58,560
Rahm Emanuel's name has come up more than Eric Holder's and he should be tossed into

1015
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,560
a fucking cannon.

1016
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:03,040
I feel like Alex just doesn't have many specifics left and he's like, oh, I remember how fun

1017
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,880
it was to make people scared of Eric Holder.

1018
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,720
Let's get back on that.

1019
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,840
So I was really struck by how weak and desperate that special report that Alex put out is.

1020
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,160
It's absolutely meaningless.

1021
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,880
There's no teeth behind it at all.

1022
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,260
I almost kind of felt when I was listening to it that he didn't have a theory, but he

1023
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:22,920
wanted to yell into the void to remind people that he's weird and he's willing to call everything

1024
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,920
fake with or without reason and he's ready to do it immediately.

1025
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,920
Yeah.

1026
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,200
He's almost putting out a beacon like the lighthouse is lit guys.

1027
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,920
I'm out here.

1028
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,920
There's no theory here.

1029
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,540
There's nothing except knee jerk denialism, which Alex attempts to justify by pointing

1030
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:39,480
to unrelated rants he went on two and a half years ago about how the media was going to

1031
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,160
false flag themselves, something that barely even makes sense with the details of the bombing.

1032
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,520
It's unconvincing, it's flat, and it's also couched in so much I'm not saying I'm just

1033
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,560
saying kind of language that it's hard to even imagine him caring about this.

1034
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,060
Reckless abandon is easy to mistake for passion, but attempts to cover your own ass preemptively

1035
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,720
just feel hollow.

1036
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,080
I was curious about QAnon was doing with this bombing, so I reached out to Travis over at

1037
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,800
QAnon Anonymous and he directed me to some of the theories that have popped up and gained

1038
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,540
traction in that world.

1039
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,800
They're all nuts, but they're better than Alex.

1040
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,800
Okay.

1041
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,120
They seem to have theories that surround the idea that there was like a secret NSA server

1042
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:19,380
at the AT&T building that would somehow prove that the Georgia election fraud conspiracies

1043
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,380
were true.

1044
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:24,200
So the bombing was actually the good guys setting off a controlled detonation to recover

1045
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,200
the evidence and stop Biden from getting into office or possibly to prevent the bad guys

1046
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,800
from being able to steal the upcoming run runoff election in Georgia.

1047
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,920
Dude.

1048
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,920
Next one.

1049
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,840
Obviously that's nonsense and it's flimsy as hell, but it makes sense with the larger

1050
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,340
conspiracies that are actually being engaged in in the QAnon world.

1051
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,340
That's fair.

1052
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:45,720
It fits the needs of the audience that QAnon has captured, whereas Alex's narrative is

1053
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,360
just dull and uninspired as well as almost entirely disconnected from anything else he's

1054
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:54,560
been yelling about except for the fact that false flags are coming, which I stress he

1055
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,560
does all the time.

1056
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,480
Do you want me to play that six minutes again?

1057
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,720
Do not, sir.

1058
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,720
I won't.

1059
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,720
And he doesn't even feel into it.

1060
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,160
No, he doesn't feel into it.

1061
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,520
He's not selling it.

1062
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,520
You got it.

1063
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,520
Look, if you got weak material, you got to sell it.

1064
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,180
You know, that's the one thing that I've, I've learned from standup so long.

1065
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:16,280
If you got weak material, you perform the shit out of that material and maybe you'll

1066
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:22,040
skate by and help you push up the next level and this you got to elevate.

1067
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,040
Yeah.

1068
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:29,320
It's, it's almost like kind of, it has the feeling of a guy and like a, like a recliner

1069
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:37,440
doing like an, I told you so, but there's nothing there being told because that is kind

1070
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,440
of the idea.

1071
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,200
The, I told you so is him playing these clips from 2018 where he said that CNN was going

1072
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,200
to fall flat.

1073
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,200
Yeah.

1074
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,200
Yeah.

1075
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,440
This is like, it almost feels like a victory lap, but there was no victory.

1076
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,440
There wasn't even a race.

1077
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,440
No, that's true.

1078
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,440
Yeah.

1079
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,000
He should be petting a cat on his lap.

1080
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,860
Just like I told all of you what would happen.

1081
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,080
It's almost confusing.

1082
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,080
Yeah.

1083
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:03,640
It's almost disorienting how disconnected it is from anything that feels real or anything

1084
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,560
that even makes sense as like conspiracy fodder.

1085
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:11,200
Like that's, that's the thing that like when I was looking at these, these QAnon things

1086
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,600
that Travis pointed me towards, like I was looking at those and I was like, I get it.

1087
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,120
I get where this is going.

1088
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,120
Sure.

1089
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,120
Sure.

1090
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,280
Media wants to make themselves look like the victims.

1091
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,280
Yeah.

1092
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,280
What?

1093
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,280
Yeah.

1094
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,280
It just doesn't, it's, it's not,

1095
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,720
I think, I think on this one, the cement is too wet.

1096
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,400
The cement is too wet right now.

1097
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,880
I think this is going to be the first one where it's like in two days, everyone will

1098
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,040
have a much better conspiracy theory.

1099
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,580
They've had more time to workshop it.

1100
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:41,080
They got more details to play with.

1101
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,120
There just aren't enough, you know, like that's, that's the thing you, with the, the Boston

1102
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,560
bombing, they're all immediately, they're pictures, suspects.

1103
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,800
There's so many different people you could investigate and go down.

1104
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,400
And on this one it's like, I don't even know where to start yet.

1105
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,400
That kind of thing.

1106
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,200
So all these people are just coming up with downright nonsense.

1107
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,200
Yeah.

1108
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:07,280
And it's, it's in the like same like in-between period of an election and an inauguration

1109
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,400
and the recount, a runoff election as it were.

1110
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,960
And we got other shit going on.

1111
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,960
Yeah.

1112
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,960
Yeah.

1113
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,960
So much other shit to deal with.

1114
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:22,800
So I'm, I'm interested to see where Alex goes with this because I think, I mean, based on

1115
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:27,160
his behaviors, it seems like this is something that's going to have to be something he keeps

1116
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,160
going on.

1117
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1118
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,360
And I'm interested to see what the narrative flashes out to be, whether he gets in line

1119
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,600
with the QAnon theories that are already much fuller than his.

1120
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1121
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,600
Totally.

1122
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,600
Or if it becomes a, I don't know what it'll become.

1123
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,600
Anyway.

1124
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,600
I don't know.

1125
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:50,040
I just think that there's some value in taking a look at the immediate reaction that he has.

1126
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,040
Totally.

1127
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,040
I agree.

1128
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:57,000
I mean, you know, it's, he knew he had to do something.

1129
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Yeah.

1130
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And this is what he did.

1131
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Exactly.

1132
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,680
It'll be a great document of what he said before he's going to say something different.

1133
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,680
You know?

1134
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:12,680
Like we have to at least, this is uninspired, but this is without question an easy receipt

1135
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,280
against tomorrow's bullshit, you know?

1136
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,280
Most likely.

1137
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,080
Maybe even today's bullshit, like that kind of level.

1138
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,080
Yeah.

1139
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,080
Yeah.

1140
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,080
Yeah.

1141
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,080
And hey, we'll be back.

1142
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,080
Oh, we will.

1143
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,080
Yeah.

1144
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:32,400
But please, my apologies if anybody felt anything that we discussed or any of our tone was flippant

1145
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,720
about the bombing.

1146
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:41,360
My heart goes out to everybody affected and I don't want you to think that, you know,

1147
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:46,080
my mocking Alex's theories are in any way meant to minimize the experience that people

1148
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,080
are having.

1149
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,080
Yeah.

1150
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,280
It's tougher, but we are not brutish.

1151
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:57,080
Life is not that brutal, so it is just fucking, what are you going to do?

1152
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,080
We'll be back.

1153
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,080
But until then, we have a website.

1154
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,080
We do have a website.

1155
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,080
It's knowledgefight.com.

1156
