00:12.960 --> 00:18.080
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating

00:18.080 --> 00:21.360
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

00:21.360 --> 00:23.920
I have great respect for knowledgefight

00:23.920 --> 00:25.040
knowledgefight

00:25.040 --> 00:27.360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

00:27.360 --> 00:29.920
Shang, we are the bad guys, knowledgefight

00:29.920 --> 00:32.080
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight

00:32.080 --> 00:34.880
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

Need, I need money

Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

00:39.280 --> 00:42.160
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and

00:42.160 --> 00:44.480
Stop it, Andy and, Andy and Kansas

00:46.080 --> 00:47.040
It's time to pray

00:47.040 --> 00:49.280
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

00:49.280 --> 00:51.680
Hello Alex, I'm a victim caller, I'm a huge fan

00:51.680 --> 00:52.880
I love your work

00:58.320 --> 00:58.820
I love you

00:59.280 --> 01:01.360
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

01:01.360 --> 01:01.840
I'm Jordan

01:01.840 --> 01:03.840
We're couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages

01:03.840 --> 01:05.600
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:05.600 --> 01:06.720
Oh indeed we are, Dan

01:06.720 --> 01:07.200
Jordan

01:07.200 --> 01:07.680
Dan!

01:07.680 --> 01:08.080
Jordan

01:08.080 --> 01:08.720
I have a quick question for you

01:08.720 --> 01:09.120
What's up?

01:09.120 --> 01:10.080
What's your bright spot today?

01:10.080 --> 01:13.040
My bright spot today is something I've actually told you about already

01:13.600 --> 01:16.320
and I'd like to continue my celebration of this

01:16.320 --> 01:20.960
and that is Rolled Gold put out a flavor of pretzels

01:20.960 --> 01:26.000
They had two different sort of limited time flavors

01:26.000 --> 01:28.720
One's a zesty buffalo and I dare not try that

01:28.720 --> 01:30.160
Oh yeah, of course not

01:30.160 --> 01:30.720
Of course not

01:30.720 --> 01:35.040
But the savory butter, I tried that, is so good

01:35.040 --> 01:35.520
So good

01:35.520 --> 01:36.400
It's so good

01:36.400 --> 01:40.000
Is it like buttered popcorn, like that feeling where you get so much butter on that

01:40.000 --> 01:42.880
It is right here, you can experience it, but don't chew into the mic

01:42.880 --> 01:43.360
I will attempt to

01:43.360 --> 01:45.520
Don't chew into the mic, I would like to get your reaction

01:46.560 --> 01:47.680
It's so good

01:47.680 --> 01:50.640
It's like a real, it's like a harsh butter

01:50.640 --> 01:52.080
It's a lot of butter

01:52.080 --> 01:53.440
It is a lot of butter

01:53.440 --> 01:53.840
Yeah

01:53.840 --> 01:57.280
It is maybe too much butter for me, but it is, it's good

01:57.280 --> 01:58.000
Yeah, it's good

01:58.000 --> 02:01.040
It's good, I have eaten half of one and I am full

02:01.040 --> 02:01.680
You're done

02:01.680 --> 02:03.680
It's very, very heavy

02:03.680 --> 02:06.560
Yeah, I expected it to be like an almost non-existent flavor

02:06.560 --> 02:07.200
Yeah, yeah

02:07.200 --> 02:11.680
Like just a little suggestion of butter or something, but nah, it's in your face

02:11.680 --> 02:12.000
Yeah

02:12.000 --> 02:13.280
Well done Rolled Gold

02:14.240 --> 02:18.240
No, when we were talking about this, I was like, oh, this sounds like a flavor-blasted goldfish

02:18.240 --> 02:18.880
Yeah

02:18.880 --> 02:23.200
That is exactly what it tastes like, it tastes like a regular rolled gold pretzel

02:23.200 --> 02:26.240
And then they were like, what if we just covered it in shit?

02:26.240 --> 02:27.120
What if we just

02:28.000 --> 02:29.040
Just doused it

02:29.040 --> 02:29.600
With butter

02:30.240 --> 02:32.080
It does feel injected with butter

02:32.080 --> 02:32.640
So what about you?

02:33.440 --> 02:38.080
My bright spot this day is actually the original Final Fantasy VII

02:38.080 --> 02:39.280
Ooh, not the remake

02:39.280 --> 02:43.120
No, on Christmas they had like a half-off special, so it was like five bucks

02:43.120 --> 02:44.160
So I was like, screw it

02:44.880 --> 02:48.400
And I started playing it again, and I am so happy I did

02:48.400 --> 02:51.280
And I'm happy that I did it after the remake, too

02:51.280 --> 02:56.560
Is because once I got out of Midgar, I felt the same way I did the first time I played it

02:56.560 --> 03:00.640
Which was just, oh, thank Christ, I'm out of that fucking place

03:00.640 --> 03:04.240
Yeah, that's the feeling, I guess, the game wants you to feel

03:04.240 --> 03:04.800
Totally

03:04.800 --> 03:08.800
The moment you leave Midgar and you can see the entire world in front of you

03:08.800 --> 03:12.800
And it shows you the world map, you're like, oh my god, I thought it was all gonna be in Midgar

03:12.800 --> 03:13.920
Like, remake is great

03:13.920 --> 03:14.240
Yeah

03:14.240 --> 03:14.880
It's really great

03:14.880 --> 03:15.280
But it's all there

03:15.280 --> 03:16.400
But it's all in Midgar

03:16.400 --> 03:16.720
Yeah, yeah

03:16.720 --> 03:20.080
Like the moment you escape and you're like, it's just amazing

03:20.080 --> 03:21.440
It really is beautiful

03:21.440 --> 03:26.160
Well, you make a strong case for me to give that game a shot, and I may in the future

03:26.160 --> 03:28.320
It's great, it really is just fucking great

03:28.320 --> 03:32.960
I may, it's definitely a big blind spot for me, it's pretty much all of the Final Fantasy series

03:32.960 --> 03:33.360
Yeah

03:33.360 --> 03:36.000
Except for the remake, which you made me play, and I enjoyed

03:36.000 --> 03:36.880
You did enjoy, right?

03:36.880 --> 03:37.440
Yeah, yeah

03:37.440 --> 03:38.080
That was pretty good

03:39.280 --> 03:40.720
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying that

03:40.720 --> 03:41.520
That is fantastic

03:41.520 --> 03:43.520
Good way to end, wrap up the year for you

03:43.520 --> 03:44.240
Absolutely

03:44.240 --> 03:46.480
So, we did not have an episode on Friday

03:46.480 --> 03:50.320
And I'm gonna say, I think it's probably good that we didn't

03:51.120 --> 03:54.160
I hope everyone, you know, celebrates Christmas, had a nice Christmas

03:54.160 --> 03:56.000
Everybody celebrates other holidays

03:56.000 --> 03:57.600
Have a great holiday time

03:57.600 --> 04:01.760
Or if you just don't celebrate anything, hope you had a good weekend

04:02.400 --> 04:07.920
I felt it would be emotionally draining for us to do an episode on Friday

04:07.920 --> 04:10.800
That was covering what Alex was doing

04:10.800 --> 04:11.120
Yeah

04:11.120 --> 04:14.960
And that was not taking his week off that he said he was going to take

04:14.960 --> 04:17.200
Yeah, the week he said he was going to take off, instead he did not take off

04:17.200 --> 04:20.800
He did not take off, and uh, because kind of just not having a fun time

04:22.080 --> 04:22.960
Not surprising

04:22.960 --> 04:24.960
Um, I didn't watch all of his content

04:24.960 --> 04:28.160
Turns out firing everybody made it very hard for me to take a day off

04:28.160 --> 04:30.720
Whoops, my only friend is Harrison Smith

04:30.720 --> 04:31.360
This sucks

04:31.360 --> 04:32.160
I'm fucked

04:32.160 --> 04:35.760
Yeah, um, I thought that there would be a little bit of schadenfreude in it

04:35.760 --> 04:40.160
I think there would be a little bit of us wallowing around in the mud watching a guy be miserable

04:40.160 --> 04:41.280
It'd be great, yeah

04:41.280 --> 04:42.720
I mean, there's some fun to that

04:42.720 --> 04:44.240
We like watching Alex be miserable

04:44.240 --> 04:46.080
I know, but we did that already

04:46.080 --> 04:46.800
That's true

04:46.800 --> 04:49.040
We already did that with the first American Journal episode

04:49.040 --> 04:50.720
Yeah, that's true, that is true, there is that

04:50.720 --> 04:55.440
It just felt almost repetitive and not like it was going to bring anything new to the table

04:55.440 --> 04:59.120
And I worried that once we came to Monday, what would we have to cover?

04:59.120 --> 04:59.520
Totally

04:59.520 --> 05:03.200
Like maybe there would be a Project Camelot episode we could have done for Friday

05:03.200 --> 05:07.200
But if Alex actually had taken that week off, we'd need that for Monday

05:07.200 --> 05:07.520
True

05:07.520 --> 05:08.160
Or whatever

05:08.160 --> 05:08.960
Could have been dangerous

05:08.960 --> 05:12.000
Yeah, and so it left me kind of in a lurch of what to do

05:12.000 --> 05:15.680
And so, you know, we took that break and here we are back on Monday

05:15.680 --> 05:18.560
And I think that this is going to be a slightly different episode

05:18.560 --> 05:21.520
Because we're just going to be covering a special report that Alex put out

05:21.520 --> 05:22.080
Okay

05:22.080 --> 05:24.240
And he put it out on Christmas

05:26.240 --> 05:28.320
There's hatchet throwing that's implied

05:28.320 --> 05:30.560
Implied hatchet throwing? Ah, that's a little disappointing

05:30.560 --> 05:31.600
Yeah, no, there's no hatchet throwing

05:31.600 --> 05:34.160
I need explicit hatchet throwing to get the fuck out

05:34.160 --> 05:36.480
No, nothing shall ever top 2018 Christmas Eve

05:36.480 --> 05:37.440
No, that's too good

05:37.440 --> 05:41.040
Um, we are going to be talking on this episode about

05:41.040 --> 05:43.920
Alex's immediate response to the bombing in Nashville

05:43.920 --> 05:44.480
Right

05:44.480 --> 05:49.040
That's going to be what we take a little time to discuss on this episode

05:49.040 --> 05:54.480
Because I think it's, you know, it's in that vein of things that I think are really important

05:54.480 --> 05:55.920
to understand about Alex

05:55.920 --> 05:58.480
And as we go into 2021

05:58.480 --> 05:59.680
I'm Dan, this is 2021

05:59.680 --> 06:00.400
Oh, yay!

06:02.000 --> 06:02.880
Now I'm confused

06:02.880 --> 06:05.840
I'll have to figure something out for actual 2021

06:05.840 --> 06:10.480
How's that one? That's my new catchphrase

06:10.480 --> 06:11.200
I'm into it

06:11.200 --> 06:12.800
That's the demon coming through the portal

06:12.800 --> 06:14.000
Exactly, yeah, yeah

06:14.000 --> 06:16.560
Um, I feel like as we get into that year

06:16.560 --> 06:20.960
One of the things I really want to stress and really want to redouble my efforts on

06:20.960 --> 06:25.600
Is looking at these things that like are really actually important about Alex

06:25.600 --> 06:26.080
Yeah, okay

06:26.080 --> 06:30.480
It's always fun to make fun of him breaking down in the studio

06:30.480 --> 06:30.880
Sure

06:30.880 --> 06:31.520
Always fun

06:31.520 --> 06:32.000
Sure

06:32.000 --> 06:34.480
Always fun to laugh at like Alex with guns

06:34.480 --> 06:34.800
Right

06:34.800 --> 06:37.280
But those are things that are almost trivial in a certain way

06:37.280 --> 06:39.200
Right, we do still have a job to do

06:39.200 --> 06:39.520
Right

06:39.520 --> 06:40.000
Yes

06:40.000 --> 06:42.800
And I think that this is part of that

06:42.800 --> 06:45.120
This is part of like looking back at that focus

06:45.120 --> 06:45.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah

06:45.920 --> 06:47.200
And so we'll get down to business on that

06:47.200 --> 06:49.920
But before we do, I'd like to take a moment to say thank you to the folks

06:49.920 --> 06:51.520
Some folks who've signed up and are supporting the show

06:51.520 --> 06:52.240

Until mentioned otherwise

07:20.400 --> 07:22.640
Yeah, until we prove it's not

07:22.640 --> 07:24.560
The star of Herbie Fully Loaded

07:24.560 --> 07:25.840
Lindsay Lohan

07:37.840 --> 07:41.840
Thank you! And then finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on Elevated Love and we appreciate that very much.

07:41.840 --> 07:48.840
So, Pyrae, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat, and I say this with disdain, you are now a technocrat.

07:48.840 --> 07:49.840
I'm a policy wonk.

07:49.840 --> 07:52.840
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic. Have yourself a brew.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.840
How's your 401k doing, bro?

07:54.840 --> 07:56.840
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

07:56.840 --> 08:00.840
Let's just get down to business. We ain't making that money off that heroin.

08:00.840 --> 08:06.840
Why you pimps so good? My neck is freakishly large. I declare info war on you.

08:06.840 --> 08:09.840
Thank you so much, Pyrae, and thank you so much, I say this with disdain.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.840
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.840
If you're out there listening and thinking, hey, I enjoy this show, I'd like to support these gents,

08:13.840 --> 08:18.840
you can do that by going to our website, knowledgefight.com, clicking the button that says support the show, we would appreciate it, or...

08:18.840 --> 08:26.840
Or what you could do, if you are feeling like your generous spirit is oppressed by a massive global corporation,

08:26.840 --> 08:32.840
literally sucking the life from the planet, then what you should do is escape from that place,

08:32.840 --> 08:40.840
take your generosity to, I don't know, Junin, and then give it to a local charity or bail fund in, specifically, Junin.

08:40.840 --> 08:41.840
Sounds good.

08:41.840 --> 08:42.840
I would say so.

08:42.840 --> 08:47.840
Alright, so, Jordan, I have a special report for you here, released on Christmas.

08:47.840 --> 08:56.840
I've not cut anything out of the special report that Alex is playing, except for one point where he plays the audio of the bomb going off in Nashville.

08:56.840 --> 09:02.840
It doesn't really add anything interesting to the episode to hear an explosion, and the audio mix is terrible, it is so loud.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.840
It would just blow out people's ears.

09:04.840 --> 09:09.840
It does make me think of that Bill Cooper episode, though, the day after the Oklahoma City bombing.

09:09.840 --> 09:14.840
In that episode, Bill made a point to play the audio of the explosion, and there's kind of echoes here,

09:14.840 --> 09:17.840
except for Bill was doing it dramatically.

09:17.840 --> 09:24.840
Bill played it repeatedly, and kind of almost like a chorus, and then he would say something in the middle.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.840
It was a call and response to the bomb.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.840
Alex just plays it, and it's very loud.

09:30.840 --> 09:35.840
All I've done here is I've just cut every time it's clear that Alex is doing a different take.

09:35.840 --> 09:40.840
Because, you know, the audio shifts slightly, and you can tell that Alex just ran out of steam, and they're like,

09:40.840 --> 09:45.840
So he did a couple of takes? Well, that's better than we've seen in the past.

09:45.840 --> 09:49.840
True, true. Let's do another sentence. Try another sentence, Alex.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.840
Yeah, try it one more time.

09:50.840 --> 09:56.840
I get the sense he was recording from home, so maybe his wife is a better producer than Rob Dew.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.840
You can't say that!

09:58.840 --> 10:00.840
Oh, God damn it, honey.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.840
So here's where we start. Here's the beginning.

10:03.840 --> 10:10.840
Today, in the early morning hours of Christmas, a large truck bomb housed inside an RV

10:10.840 --> 10:14.840
exploded outside the AT&T main communications building in Nashville.

10:14.840 --> 10:19.840
The individual, organization, or group behind the attack went out of their way

10:19.840 --> 10:24.840
to warn the public to get away before the bomb detonated by broadcasting for more than ten minutes

10:24.840 --> 10:27.840
that there was a bomb on board the vehicle that was about to detonate.

10:27.840 --> 10:33.840
911 also received a call claiming that gunshots had been fired in the area minutes before the explosion.

10:33.840 --> 10:37.840
The FBI is now reporting that human remains have been found in the debris at the blast site.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.840
So you can already tell those are multiple takes?

10:40.840 --> 10:49.840
Yeah, the 911 cut was almost Paul Joseph Watson-esque, of coming in before the breath is finished.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.840
The hole was cut in the middle of a sentence, though.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.840
Yeah, so infuriating. I hate it.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.840
So on Christmas Day, in case people did not hear about this,

10:57.840 --> 11:01.840
a bomb was detonated in an RV parked in downtown Nashville.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.840
At the time of our recording, one of the working theories that people have

11:04.840 --> 11:07.840
is that it's possible that the person was targeting the AT&T building,

11:07.840 --> 11:10.840
which was quite nearby the blast site.

11:10.840 --> 11:15.840
This, as a possible motive for an act of domestic terror, makes complete sense.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.840
If you were going to go through the trouble of carrying out a bombing,

11:17.840 --> 11:21.840
you would likely want whatever damage you do to have maximum impact.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.840
AT&T's operations in Nashville are housed at that building,

11:24.840 --> 11:27.840
so the potential disruption you could cause by damaging that would be huge,

11:27.840 --> 11:30.840
as we've seen from the fallout of the bombing itself,

11:30.840 --> 11:34.840
with some people still being without phone service today as we're recording.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.840
This is all a very tragic turn of events,

11:36.840 --> 11:39.840
and my heart goes out to the people affected by this act.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.840
Thankfully, there weren't any civilian casualties,

11:42.840 --> 11:44.840
and the human remains that were found there,

11:44.840 --> 11:46.840
literally right before we started recording,

11:46.840 --> 11:49.840
I saw it was being reported that they have matched the DNA

11:49.840 --> 11:52.840
to the person they suspect is the bomber.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.840
There's a lot of stuff that's on my own still about this event,

11:54.840 --> 11:57.840
but there are definitely some fair assumptions you can make about it.

11:57.840 --> 12:02.840
Obviously, this wasn't an accident, so there was an intention behind this bombing.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.840
It was clearly meant to be a spectacle and something that would be traumatic,

12:05.840 --> 12:07.840
given that it was planned for Christmas morning,

12:07.840 --> 12:10.840
which is a very solemn time for many in this country.

12:10.840 --> 12:13.840
My gut tells me, based on these pieces of information,

12:13.840 --> 12:15.840
that this was an ideological act.

12:15.840 --> 12:19.840
But who knows what that ideology is at this point?

12:19.840 --> 12:25.840
Right. I mean, it's unfortunate that the vibe I'm getting from this whole thing

12:25.840 --> 12:29.840
is Vietnamese monks self-immolating,

12:29.840 --> 12:36.840
but because they believe that the Laotians are going to sneak in through the earth,

12:36.840 --> 12:40.840
where it's like, yes, you are making a statement.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.840
This is a problem, though. This is an issue.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.840
I'm not sure I quite follow what you're saying.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.840
5G isn't going to hurt anyone. Do you know what I'm saying?

12:47.840 --> 12:49.840
Well, but I don't know if that's the motivation either.

12:49.840 --> 12:50.840
No, no, no, totally.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.840
That's making an assumption there.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.840
No, of course. That's why I said the vibe I'm getting,

12:54.840 --> 12:57.840
not like, I know for a fact that this is why you did that.

12:57.840 --> 13:02.840
But that's the general feeling that people are passing around.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.840
Some people are speculating on that.

13:04.840 --> 13:12.840
What I'm trying to clearly delineate here is the idea of what is responsible speculation and what is not.

13:12.840 --> 13:13.840
Oh, totally.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.840
Speculating that this was motivated by some sort of an ideology

13:16.840 --> 13:21.840
based on the actions, the circumstances, responsible speculation.

13:21.840 --> 13:22.840
Sure.

13:22.840 --> 13:29.840
Claiming that you know exactly what it is or choosing what you want the target you think it might have been.

13:29.840 --> 13:30.840
Sure.

13:30.840 --> 13:31.840
And then why would they do that?

13:31.840 --> 13:32.840
Sure.

13:32.840 --> 13:33.840
That's not great.

13:33.840 --> 13:34.840
No, totally.

13:34.840 --> 13:35.840
That's not grounded.

13:35.840 --> 13:40.840
And I think that, you know, I see that possibility.

13:40.840 --> 13:41.840
Yeah, sure.

13:41.840 --> 13:45.840
It could turn out that more information comes out and he was someone who was worried about 5G.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.840
Yeah, no, I don't know by any stretch.

13:48.840 --> 13:54.840
And nor am I making a claim that that's what's going on by any means.

13:54.840 --> 14:02.840
But from what I understand so far, it does have that feeling of somebody who is,

14:02.840 --> 14:05.840
I guess, sacrificing their own life for something they believe in.

14:05.840 --> 14:10.840
And chances are, if you're going after AT&T.

14:10.840 --> 14:13.840
And if you unpack that a little bit more, you're still making a giant assumption.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.840
Oh no, I'm making a massive assumption.

14:15.840 --> 14:16.840
Yeah.

14:16.840 --> 14:21.840
And I don't think that, you know, that is substantiated yet.

14:21.840 --> 14:22.840
100% agree.

14:22.840 --> 14:26.840
It could in the future, and again, this is the issue with the wet concrete.

14:26.840 --> 14:27.840
Right.

14:27.840 --> 14:31.840
You gotta respect the wet concrete until it dries because otherwise you just fuck it up.

14:31.840 --> 14:32.840
Yeah, totally.

14:32.840 --> 14:37.840
It's a point that I've made a lot in that Alex Jones knows that his business model really only works

14:37.840 --> 14:39.840
and is powered by uncertainty.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.840
The moment that the cement is wet and he can write his initials on there before it dries,

14:42.840 --> 14:45.840
that is the time he knows he has to go to work.

14:45.840 --> 14:49.840
And naturally, on Christmas Day, when he's already failing to take this week off,

14:49.840 --> 14:54.840
he records a special report about the Nashville bombing because on some possibly subconscious level,

14:54.840 --> 14:59.840
he knows that if he waits until his show on Sunday, there's a chance that more details will be known by then

14:59.840 --> 15:02.840
and it'll be too late for him to profit off this tragedy.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.840
We watch this unfold in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing,

15:05.840 --> 15:08.840
and it seems kinda likely that this is gonna be another big push for him now.

15:08.840 --> 15:09.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:09.840 --> 15:15.840
A couple of things are different, though, which make the end of 2020 a lot more complicated for someone like Alex.

15:15.840 --> 15:20.840
For one, there are tons of people running around online competing for access to that wet cement.

15:20.840 --> 15:25.840
Alex doesn't have exclusive control over the paranoid conspiracy space anymore,

15:25.840 --> 15:31.840
so there are other people who are equally able to put their imprint on stories before the information becomes public.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.840
The other major difference is that people keep suing Alex now.

15:34.840 --> 15:39.840
In the past, he was a lunatic yelling that everyone just thought, eh, it's best to leave him alone.

15:39.840 --> 15:43.840
But he went too far, and finally some people stood up to his bullying.

15:43.840 --> 15:48.840
That had a domino effect of people not being afraid to burden him with lawsuits when he defames them.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.840
And that has a chilling effect on someone's ability to defame people freely.

15:51.840 --> 15:52.840
It should.

15:52.840 --> 15:53.840
Yeah.

15:53.840 --> 15:59.840
So now Alex knows that there are some limitations to what he legally can speculate about without consequences.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.840
Alex knows that, you know, that this is just the reality of his life.

16:02.840 --> 16:08.840
Meanwhile, these other people who want to get access to that wet cement, they're mostly anonymous weirdos online.

16:08.840 --> 16:12.840
They're operating fake-named alias QAnon accounts.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.840
They don't have to worry about being sued because they're essentially internet phantoms.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.840
They aren't bound by the same fear of consequence that Alex has,

16:19.840 --> 16:25.840
so they're free to speculate and craft conspiracies in ways Alex is not, but he used to be.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.840
Yeah, and he can't direct it.

16:27.840 --> 16:37.840
He now has to, if something gets too popular, he has to assimilate it instead of being able to kind of push the narrative in any direction that he would prefer.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.840
Now he's getting pushed.

16:39.840 --> 16:44.840
Well, I think even in the past it was even more complicated that he was assimilating and pushing simultaneously.

16:44.840 --> 16:45.840
Sure, sure, sure.

16:45.840 --> 16:53.840
You know, co-opting hot online trends and then making them, you know, match the Info Wars narrative.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.840
It's too obvious now.

16:55.840 --> 17:03.840
Well, that's the thing. He could straddle the line between the part of the internet that nobody goes on anymore

17:03.840 --> 17:09.840
and then come back to the real world as being that kind of almost bridge between them.

17:09.840 --> 17:13.840
And now the crazy part is the main internet, so what are you going to do?

17:13.840 --> 17:15.840
Yeah, it's all over the place.

17:15.840 --> 17:17.840
Yeah, it's a mess.

17:17.840 --> 17:19.840
It's great stuff. I think we're doing awesome.

17:19.840 --> 17:26.840
So that's one of the reasons why I decided if we're doing this episode it'd probably be good to talk about Alex's immediate response.

17:26.840 --> 17:34.840
Because that's the concrete wet moment, let's see what he can do in this new Info War battle space.

17:34.840 --> 17:41.840
Because it's different now. The elements have changed from when he would be able to be the king of the roost.

17:41.840 --> 17:47.840
Yeah, and it'll be interesting to see how the story changes tomorrow, and we'll have to do a completely different episode.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.840
Sure, but it's still important to check in on this.

17:49.840 --> 17:50.840
Totally.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.840
So here Alex goes on.

17:52.840 --> 17:56.840
Who would have a motive to carry out an attack like this?

17:56.840 --> 18:01.840
Could it be a former employee or engineer angry at AT&T?

18:01.840 --> 18:09.840
Could it be an organization or group, a terrorist organization, angry at AT&T for their politics for surveilling the public?

18:09.840 --> 18:12.840
Or perhaps owning the propaganda outlet CNN?

18:12.840 --> 18:19.840
Rest assured, these are the first questions that FBI and ATF agents are asking right now on the ground in Tennessee.

18:19.840 --> 18:27.840
So if you notice, the two possibilities that Alex provides for potential entities with a motive seem to imply that he's sympathetic to the bombing.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.840
Yeah! Yeah!

18:29.840 --> 18:35.840
It's immediately like, maybe it's someone who's mad that AT&T spies on everybody illegally.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.840
Like, that's weird. That's really weird.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.840
I mean, I can see it.

18:40.840 --> 18:47.840
No, no, all the reasons. I'm not saying those with the same glee he kind of seems to have as to like,

18:47.840 --> 18:51.840
here are the reasons that I would bomb AT&T is kind of what he's saying.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.840
Yeah, that's the feeling that it gives.

18:54.840 --> 19:00.840
Wait, what? AT&T owns CNN? That's why? That's what you've decided?

19:00.840 --> 19:01.840
This is weird.

19:01.840 --> 19:07.840
Let's think of the reasonable reasons to bomb AT&T off the top of my head, the ones that I appreciate.

19:07.840 --> 19:08.840
CNN, obviously.

19:08.840 --> 19:09.840
Yeah, it's got to be CNN.

19:09.840 --> 19:17.840
It's just strange to me that immediately, as this special report opens, the options that he's presenting for why the person did what they did,

19:17.840 --> 19:20.840
like their motivation, are identical beliefs to his.

19:20.840 --> 19:21.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:21.840 --> 19:22.840
That's strange.

19:22.840 --> 19:23.840
Totally.

19:23.840 --> 19:27.840
He's identifying with and sympathizing with the actor in this case.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.840
Maybe he blew up AT&T because they own Brian Stelter. I don't know.

19:30.840 --> 19:34.840
Maybe they specifically chose Brian. Was there a note that said,

19:34.840 --> 19:39.840
Brian Stelter looks like a pedophile? Because I feel like that might tie back to me somehow.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.840
Stelter may come up later.

19:41.840 --> 19:42.840
Of course he does.

19:42.840 --> 19:50.840
So, Alex, he's planted this kernel of like AT&T owns CNN, and so then he goes from there.

19:50.840 --> 19:59.840
In the summer of 2018, CNN deployed a new talking point that was then adopted by almost every other cable news

19:59.840 --> 20:07.840
or broadcast news organization in the United States that Donald Trump, by criticizing the press's attacks on him,

20:07.840 --> 20:13.840
was going to trigger terrorist attacks on their facilities and the murder of journalists.

20:13.840 --> 20:18.840
They hammered it hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times with no proof.

20:18.840 --> 20:26.840
So what's going on now is that Alex is trying to implant the idea that CNN said Trump's rhetoric would lead to a rise in attacks on journalists

20:26.840 --> 20:33.840
in preparation for this Christmas Day RV bomb against AT&T's Nashville headquarters since AT&T owns CNN,

20:33.840 --> 20:37.840
even though everyone knows that the CNN center is in Atlanta. This is stupid.

20:37.840 --> 20:46.840
Yeah, I think there have already been plenty of other examples you could point to of their saying that rhetoric increases violence.

20:46.840 --> 20:53.840
Oh yeah, or you could just go check out the US Press Freedom Tracker, which is a little service that documents attacks on journalists in the United States.

20:53.840 --> 21:01.840
In 2018, there were 35. In 2019, 34. Little progress, one less. In 2020, there have been 274.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.840
I feel like that's a jump.

21:03.840 --> 21:09.840
Yeah. Some of this is civilians assaulting the press, but a considerable chunk are police carrying out these assaults.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.840
So surprising!

21:11.840 --> 21:18.840
It's hard not to see this kind of ripple effect as being part of Trump's rhetoric, where he labels the press the enemy of the people

21:18.840 --> 21:22.840
and also constantly talks about how police, you know, if they rough people up, they shouldn't get in trouble.

21:22.840 --> 21:23.840
That's great!

21:23.840 --> 21:29.840
If I were a cop, I think I might get the sense that the president is trying to subtly tell me to hit a journalist, and he'll look the other way.

21:29.840 --> 21:36.840
Yeah. It's a good thing that not all mayors agree. Oh no, all mayors agree that you should hit people. That's great.

21:36.840 --> 21:43.840
Anyway, there's no need for an RV bomb at the AT&T building to pay off the fears that Trump's rhetoric would lead to a rise in danger for journalists.

21:43.840 --> 21:46.840
That argument could be easily made without it.

21:46.840 --> 21:58.840
So this doesn't even really satisfy in terms of like, oh, so you're going back two years to something that you yelled about about CNN being the predictive element of...

21:58.840 --> 22:00.840
That's really thin.

22:00.840 --> 22:07.840
If you go back to the MIAC report, you can see that there has been no right-wing violence since then, and that thing was crazy.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.840
Yeah, thankfully I exposed it.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I saved everybody.

22:11.840 --> 22:15.840
Thankfully, Alex is a careful man, so he wants to make a quick clarification.

22:15.840 --> 22:20.840
To be crystal clear, InfoWars is not saying that CNN is behind the attacks.

22:20.840 --> 22:31.840
What we are saying is a known fact that they are the main mouthpiece of the criminal elements of the deep state and shadow government that are battling to recapture control of the United States.

22:31.840 --> 22:40.840
So the clarification is that Alex isn't saying that CNN is behind the bombing, just that they're a mouthpiece for the evil demon globalists who are trying to salvage control of the country.

22:40.840 --> 22:43.840
If you're following his point, he's saying that he doesn't want CNN to sue him.

22:43.840 --> 22:44.840
No.

22:44.840 --> 22:48.840
His theory is that the evil globalists carried out the bombing to retain control of the United States.

22:48.840 --> 22:49.840
Sounds right.

22:49.840 --> 22:53.840
And CNN set the stage for it by saying Trump's rhetoric was a danger to journalists.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.840
Thank you for clarifying that it was not CNN who was behind the bombing.

22:56.840 --> 22:59.840
It seems like they're still in on it based on your theory.

22:59.840 --> 23:05.840
A RICO case could probably get him, but I don't think they're behind it, Dan.

23:05.840 --> 23:16.840
In this next clip, we see another characteristic of Alex's bullshit, and that is the, you know, we've seen this in pretty much every single thing that he calls a false flag.

23:16.840 --> 23:19.840
He's like, well, there's a chance it's real. Maybe. Tiny.

23:19.840 --> 23:22.840
But he likes the reasons the bomber may have done it.

23:22.840 --> 23:26.840
There's a one percent chance it's real, that kind of thing. He says that with everything.

23:26.840 --> 23:32.840
It is entirely possible that a lone wolf or small group carried this operation out for other reasons.

23:32.840 --> 23:42.840
But when you look at the history and the motive and the background, and who stands to gain from this, and all the media pre-conditioning and programming, this thing reeks as a possible deep state false flag operation.

23:42.840 --> 23:46.840
So it's a possible deep state false flag operation at this point.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.840
That's nice. That's nice.

23:48.840 --> 23:51.840
Let's wait till three minutes later in the special report.

23:51.840 --> 23:57.840
I was going to say, the suing does seem to have a chilling effect on the first statement.

23:57.840 --> 24:01.840
I don't know how well it carries over to statements two and following.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.840
Yeah, yeah. It takes you longer to get into it.

24:04.840 --> 24:05.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.840
You gotta warm up to the...

24:07.840 --> 24:11.840
It's almost like if you say it first, then the rest of them don't count, you know?

24:11.840 --> 24:15.840
Like I said this the first time, so you know that I still mean it on the other ones.

24:15.840 --> 24:16.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:16.840 --> 24:21.840
So this is really the main thrust, I believe, of what he's saying.

24:21.840 --> 24:27.840
Is that two years ago, CNN did all this shit, showing it's proof that they were planning to do this now. Which is weird.

24:27.840 --> 24:34.840
In August and October of 2018, I went to the airwaves to desperately warn the people

24:34.840 --> 24:42.840
that MSM was clearly preconditioning the population to accept that when terror attacks that they said were imminent

24:42.840 --> 24:47.840
hit mainstream media, that it was indeed the fault of whatever patsy they produced

24:47.840 --> 24:51.840
who would then take credit for Donald Trump, the nationalist and populist movement.

24:51.840 --> 24:58.840
I had seen this exact same rhetoric before, right before the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing

24:58.840 --> 25:01.840
that was then blamed on the Patriot movement and Rush Limbaugh.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.840
Right, so...

25:03.840 --> 25:08.840
Well, had they not done it, I don't think we would have blamed them for it.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.840
Well, there is that matter.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.840
You're not going to get anywhere with Alex on that line of thinking.

25:14.840 --> 25:16.840
Yeah, I don't think I'm going to win that one.

25:16.840 --> 25:22.840
I don't see the connective tissue here. Even as a conspiracy, I think this is soft.

25:22.840 --> 25:24.840
This is really soft.

25:24.840 --> 25:32.840
I think the softest part of it is you are telling me that CNN is a multi-billion dollar a year corporation

25:32.840 --> 25:38.840
and they spent two years planning this bombing, this bombing.

25:38.840 --> 25:44.840
I feel like the hardest part to plan about this was the AV system that shouted,

25:44.840 --> 25:46.840
there's a bomb coming!

25:46.840 --> 25:50.840
It doesn't make sense.

25:50.840 --> 25:56.840
In terms of timing, in terms of motive, in terms of method...

25:56.840 --> 26:00.840
I guess CNN did finally win the war on Christmas. Is that what he's going for?

26:00.840 --> 26:06.840
If Alex's whole thing is that these false flags are supposed to create shock and terror and horror,

26:06.840 --> 26:11.840
then why would there be a warning to get away from it?

26:11.840 --> 26:15.840
Wouldn't the globalists want to kill people? They don't care about human life.

26:15.840 --> 26:20.840
That doesn't make any sense. This doesn't match any of his M.O.'s.

26:20.840 --> 26:26.840
You know what it felt like listening to this? It's just trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.

26:26.840 --> 26:30.840
It just doesn't work. This is grim.

26:30.840 --> 26:36.840
I think this one might be just too confusing to make a good conspiracy theory out of.

26:36.840 --> 26:38.840
Confusing can be done.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.840
It can be done.

26:40.840 --> 26:46.840
It requires finesse. It requires a little bit of trying.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.840
Alex is not ready to try anymore.

26:48.840 --> 26:52.840
There's a certain part of this one that's just so fucking...

26:52.840 --> 26:58.840
Everyone is not scared. Everyone is kind of scratching their head going like,

26:58.840 --> 26:59.840
Why?

26:59.840 --> 27:01.840
I think people are scared, and rightfully.

27:01.840 --> 27:02.840
You think so?

27:02.840 --> 27:05.840
I think it's a very traumatic event.

27:05.840 --> 27:06.840
Oh, totally.

27:06.840 --> 27:12.840
I think some people were hurt. It caused a lot of destruction.

27:12.840 --> 27:24.840
I don't think that it scares people in the same way some other, much more casualty events have.

27:24.840 --> 27:28.840
But I do still think that people see something like that and are scared.

27:28.840 --> 27:32.840
No, I apologize for minimizing the feelings of the people who are directly affected by it.

27:32.840 --> 27:36.840
I meant more the people who would be affected by the conspiracy theories.

27:36.840 --> 27:39.840
Obviously, I'm not going to be like,

27:39.840 --> 27:42.840
Eh, whatever. You got blown up. No big deal.

27:42.840 --> 27:50.840
This, though, is such a thing where all of these Q conspiracies and all of this stuff seem to be swirling together.

27:50.840 --> 27:53.840
But even then, the traction is just more like,

27:53.840 --> 27:57.840
I guess we got to wait until we find out why the guy actually did it.

27:57.840 --> 28:03.840
This one seems tough on Alex. It seems like he's, I don't know,

28:03.840 --> 28:08.840
The way I would describe it is he's trying to walk a little bit fast outside a pool.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.840
His feet are wet.

28:10.840 --> 28:11.840
Holding scissors.

28:11.840 --> 28:12.840
He's just worried about slipping.

28:12.840 --> 28:16.840
You know, it doesn't have traction.

28:16.840 --> 28:17.840
It doesn't.

28:17.840 --> 28:18.840
It doesn't.

28:18.840 --> 28:19.840
It doesn't.

28:19.840 --> 28:20.840
No.

28:20.840 --> 28:21.840
It's a weird one.

28:21.840 --> 28:22.840
This is a really weird situation.

28:22.840 --> 28:27.840
So now we reach the point in the special report, which is maybe like 20 seconds after he said maybe it's real,

28:27.840 --> 28:30.840
where he definitively says that it was the deep state.

28:30.840 --> 28:31.840
Okay.

28:31.840 --> 28:37.840
Within days of the Supreme Court of Michigan declaring that Governor Whitmer was nothing more than a dictator

28:37.840 --> 28:39.840
and that her COVID lockdowns were illegal,

28:39.840 --> 28:44.840
suddenly the FBI busted a terror cell of militia that had been playing to kidnap her.

28:44.840 --> 28:50.840
It came out a week later that the terror cell was led by two FBI informants

28:50.840 --> 28:52.840
and the whole thing had been a giant setup.

28:52.840 --> 28:58.840
That is a smaller microcosm of what the deep state does when they actually carry out larger terror attacks

28:58.840 --> 29:01.840
like we just witnessed in Nashville, Tennessee.

29:01.840 --> 29:02.840
Oh boy.

29:02.840 --> 29:05.840
So to be clear, I'm not taking Alex out of context at all.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.840
No, that one pretty much says it.

29:07.840 --> 29:08.840
He's not spitballing.

29:08.840 --> 29:09.840
He's not asking questions.

29:09.840 --> 29:13.840
He just literally said that the Tennessee bombing was carried out by the deep state.

29:13.840 --> 29:17.840
It's in the context of his meaningless rambling, but it's still a definite statement.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.840
He's not suggesting it's possible that the deep state did this.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.840
He's explicitly arrived at that conclusion.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.840
And that is being put to the audience.

29:25.840 --> 29:30.840
Also, the Michigan Supreme Court did not declare Whitmer a tyrant

29:30.840 --> 29:32.840
and that was not a fake kidnapping plot.

29:32.840 --> 29:34.840
No, no, no it was not.

29:34.840 --> 29:39.840
You're going to look me in the eye and tell me that the devil said to these people,

29:39.840 --> 29:42.840
Hey, no death.

29:42.840 --> 29:46.840
Yeah, yeah, that's part of the devil's trickiness.

29:46.840 --> 29:50.840
Hey, listen, minor injuries only.

29:50.840 --> 29:56.840
So you might be asking like, what, why, you know?

29:56.840 --> 29:58.840
I would be asking myself that.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.840
What does the globalist gain through this?

30:01.840 --> 30:02.840
What do the globalists gain?

30:02.840 --> 30:03.840
Agreed.

30:03.840 --> 30:07.840
This country is in an existential battle fighting for its very existence

30:07.840 --> 30:10.840
against a chai comm led globalist takeover.

30:10.840 --> 30:14.840
And with 25 days until the attempted installment and coronation

30:14.840 --> 30:18.840
of their agent, Joe Biden, the mainstream media is on the ropes.

30:18.840 --> 30:19.840
People hate them.

30:19.840 --> 30:20.840
They don't believe them.

30:20.840 --> 30:21.840
They don't trust them.

30:21.840 --> 30:25.840
And as massive evidence comes out of collective election fraud carried

30:25.840 --> 30:28.840
by the deep state and their cohorts, the Democratic Party,

30:28.840 --> 30:32.840
the system needs something to turn themselves into victims.

30:32.840 --> 30:37.840
This is designed to silence the American people and their opposition

30:37.840 --> 30:40.840
to the great reset and the huge COVID lockdown.

30:40.840 --> 30:41.840
Really?

30:41.840 --> 30:43.840
That is meant to be permanent if Joe Biden gets into power.

30:43.840 --> 30:44.840
This just seems-

30:44.840 --> 30:45.840
I just don't buy it.

30:45.840 --> 30:46.840
No.

30:46.840 --> 30:47.840
No.

30:47.840 --> 30:48.840
No.

30:48.840 --> 30:49.840
This is stupid.

30:49.840 --> 30:52.840
Isn't it strange, though, like how uninspiring, uninspired this is?

30:52.840 --> 30:53.840
Yeah.

30:53.840 --> 30:54.840
Just like-

30:54.840 --> 30:55.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:55.840 --> 30:56.840
Really?

30:56.840 --> 30:57.840
Yeah.

30:57.840 --> 30:58.840
Come on, man.

30:58.840 --> 30:59.840
That was to make the globalists look like victims?

30:59.840 --> 31:00.840
What is that?

31:00.840 --> 31:01.840
That doesn't even make sense.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.840
That doesn't fit what's going on at all.

31:03.840 --> 31:04.840
No.

31:04.840 --> 31:06.840
You know, like if this was the Boston bombing,

31:06.840 --> 31:09.840
then you can sell me on something like that.

31:09.840 --> 31:11.840
But this is just so different.

31:11.840 --> 31:12.840
It's just so different.

31:12.840 --> 31:16.840
And you can't say the same thing about something that's this different.

31:16.840 --> 31:21.840
And what I don't understand is like the Christmas angle isn't even in it for us.

31:21.840 --> 31:22.840
Yeah, right?

31:22.840 --> 31:23.840
There's no attack on Christmas.

31:23.840 --> 31:24.840
There's no war on Christmas.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.840
Oh, that seems so easy.

31:26.840 --> 31:27.840
It's deep in his rhetoric.

31:27.840 --> 31:28.840
He thinks there's a war on Christmas.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.840
There's a literal bombing on Christmas.

31:30.840 --> 31:33.840
Yeah, but I think he's still of the opinion that when it comes out,

31:33.840 --> 31:37.840
the full story, it's going to be somebody more on the,

31:37.840 --> 31:40.840
I hate the people who have the war on Christmas side.

31:40.840 --> 31:44.840
So he probably thinks preemptively, I don't know if I can pull that one off.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.840
That may be. That may be.

31:46.840 --> 31:52.840
All I know is that Alex is a man with a deep archive.

31:52.840 --> 31:56.840
And he has great employees working for him who can pull up every time

31:56.840 --> 31:58.840
that he said that false flags are coming.

31:58.840 --> 31:59.840
Sure.

31:59.840 --> 32:02.840
I have been on record dozens of times in the last month saying,

32:02.840 --> 32:06.840
we are now in the season of the false flag.

32:06.840 --> 32:09.840
We are now in the season of the establishment loading up truck bombs

32:09.840 --> 32:11.840
to bomb themselves, to be victims.

32:11.840 --> 32:14.840
And I have our archivist looking for it right now.

32:14.840 --> 32:17.840
But thanks to Media Matters, George Soros' organization,

32:17.840 --> 32:21.840
we have two examples from two years ago where I warned and foreshadowed

32:21.840 --> 32:24.840
what we now happen to see unfolding.

32:24.840 --> 32:28.840
So he does not have these, I guess the archivists are working on it.

32:28.840 --> 32:29.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:29.840 --> 32:30.840
They're working on it.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.840
Harrison Smith is coming in on Christmas to try and find these clips.

32:32.840 --> 32:33.840
It's tough.

32:33.840 --> 32:36.840
There's a lot of our episodes to go through to find those clips.

32:36.840 --> 32:37.840
That's true.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.840
So yeah, Harrison's got to figure that out.

32:39.840 --> 32:40.840
Yeah, yeah.

32:40.840 --> 32:41.840
And instead they just Googled.

32:41.840 --> 32:42.840
Have you got an email yet?

32:42.840 --> 32:46.840
They just Googled on Media Matters.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.840
And searched for times that Alex has said fucked up things.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.840
Oh man, it's really nice of them to keep track for them.

32:51.840 --> 32:52.840
Yeah.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.840
So here is the clips that Alex plays from Media Matters of him

32:56.840 --> 32:58.840
predicting what we saw.

32:58.840 --> 32:59.840
Yeah.

32:59.840 --> 33:02.840
And ladies and gentlemen, this is about taking down America and Trump

33:02.840 --> 33:05.840
and the recovery and the entire free press.

33:05.840 --> 33:11.840
So I'm telling you, like night follows day, the stage terror attacks

33:11.840 --> 33:18.840
are coming on big tech, government buildings, mainstream media.

33:18.840 --> 33:20.840
All the stars will be gone that day.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.840
All the stelters will be gone that day.

33:22.840 --> 33:24.840
All the Lester Holtz will be gone.

33:24.840 --> 33:28.840
And they are going to drive a truck bomb or something into a daycare

33:28.840 --> 33:33.840
at CNN or ABC or something and have people shooting everybody, you name it.

33:33.840 --> 33:37.840
You can see the pre-programming and say, see, the hate did this.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.840
The hate did this while they cover up Antifa and the attack on Scalise

33:40.840 --> 33:44.840
and the attack on Rand Paul and all the calls to kidnap Barron and rape him.

33:44.840 --> 33:46.840
And we've got to get this out to Trump.

33:46.840 --> 33:48.840
We've got to let him know because Trump's not calling for violence.

33:48.840 --> 33:51.840
When they attack Trump and lie about it, he says, you're fake news.

33:51.840 --> 33:52.840
You're lying.

33:52.840 --> 33:53.840
I'm not a racist.

33:53.840 --> 33:54.840
I love Mexicans, whatever.

33:54.840 --> 33:55.840
They go, oh, you're a Nazi.

33:55.840 --> 33:56.840
You're calling for violence.

33:56.840 --> 33:57.840
Blood on your hands.

33:57.840 --> 34:00.840
Same thing with me editing stuff out of context to build this.

34:00.840 --> 34:01.840
They got big tech.

34:01.840 --> 34:02.840
They got the media.

34:02.840 --> 34:03.840
They got the Democrats.

34:03.840 --> 34:07.840
They got Warner reportedly running it all ready to quarterback.

34:07.840 --> 34:10.840
This whole time could happen today, tomorrow, next month.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.840
But understand, here's the big emergency.

34:12.840 --> 34:16.840
These are only probing attacks to shut it up and to test the public.

34:16.840 --> 34:21.840
Will they buy that Soros and Hillary and Bill and Obama and CNN are poor victims?

34:21.840 --> 34:23.840
This is introducing them as the targets.

34:23.840 --> 34:27.840
They can whine and moan and predict if Trump doesn't stop.

34:27.840 --> 34:28.840
You're going to get us all killed.

34:28.840 --> 34:35.840
And then in rolls that big ass truck bomb into CNN Center Atlanta.

34:35.840 --> 34:36.840
Boom.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.840
All the execs will be off on a special meeting that day.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.840
Most of CNN crew would have never expected they'll get hit.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.840
They'll even take out a large group of their top people.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.840
Yeah, they're getting ready to hit themselves and hit themselves hard.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.840
MSNBC, ABC, they're going to hit themselves.

34:50.840 --> 34:55.840
So I have a couple of reasons why I don't take anything that Alex played there as sincere

34:55.840 --> 34:58.840
or a meaningful prediction about what actually happened on Friday.

34:58.840 --> 35:02.840
The first is that Alex literally says the target would be CNN Center in Atlanta.

35:02.840 --> 35:06.840
And it would happen when Brian Stelter and Lester Holt aren't there because they would have advance warning.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.840
Which we've seen played out.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.840
Stelter and Holt do not work in Tennessee.

35:10.840 --> 35:11.840
Alright.

35:11.840 --> 35:17.840
The second major reason that this rings hollow to me is that the specific of Alex mentioning a truck bomb in a daycare center,

35:17.840 --> 35:20.840
that's not meaningful in terms of a prediction.

35:20.840 --> 35:23.840
That's hearkening back to Oklahoma City.

35:23.840 --> 35:27.840
That's very specifically a part of right wing terrorist history.

35:27.840 --> 35:28.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:28.840 --> 35:31.840
It's a huge part of the mythology and zeitgeist of the patriot world,

35:31.840 --> 35:35.840
them being torn between celebrating Timothy McVeigh and pretending he was a patsy.

35:35.840 --> 35:41.840
The third reason I take issue with this prediction is because these clips were from two and a half years ago.

35:41.840 --> 35:46.840
This article that Alex is playing, a Media Matters clip from, is from August 2018.

35:46.840 --> 35:51.840
So it just stretches any kind of credulity to imagine that the globalists are broadcasting their signals,

35:51.840 --> 35:55.840
pushing the programming so hard that Alex picked up on them,

35:55.840 --> 35:59.840
then waited 28 months and carried out a stage bombing that didn't kill anyone

35:59.840 --> 36:03.840
at the building that's owned by CNN's parent company but isn't really associated with CNN itself.

36:03.840 --> 36:04.840
Correct.

36:04.840 --> 36:05.840
This is thin soup.

36:05.840 --> 36:11.840
Yeah, I think what he should be doing, actually I think what we'll see tomorrow or Tuesday,

36:11.840 --> 36:14.840
or when he starts hitting the ground rolling on this,

36:14.840 --> 36:17.840
this is a practice run, right?

36:17.840 --> 36:22.840
You have to call this a practice run before they actually do the real stuff.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.840
You mean like the bombing?

36:24.840 --> 36:26.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what Alex has to do.

36:26.840 --> 36:29.840
I thought you meant this video is a practice run.

36:29.840 --> 36:31.840
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36:31.840 --> 36:35.840
This video is him practicing trying to make a conspiracy out of this and he's whiffing.

36:35.840 --> 36:40.840
And he accidentally put it, he posted it, this was his daily affirmations, he's just talking to a mirror.

36:40.840 --> 36:41.840
It is all fake.

36:41.840 --> 36:43.840
Yeah, exactly.

36:43.840 --> 36:50.840
So that's possible, but also the fourth reason I reject this bullshit is because Alex constantly predicts false flags

36:50.840 --> 36:53.840
and bombings and shit that never happens.

36:53.840 --> 36:57.840
If I wanted to, I could put together a giant compilation of him doing just that.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.840
And it turns out, I do want to.

36:59.840 --> 37:01.840
How's Chicago doing? Are we a giant whole?

37:01.840 --> 37:03.840
Well, I did want to do this actually.

37:03.840 --> 37:06.840
Usually I'll just say I could do it, but I actually did it this time.

37:06.840 --> 37:11.840
So here's a super cut of Alex making predictions of false flags coming and calling random events fake.

37:11.840 --> 37:14.840
This could have been so much longer. It's six minutes.

37:14.840 --> 37:15.840
It's six minutes?

37:15.840 --> 37:19.840
And it could have been so much longer, but I feel like that's already trying our audience's patience.

37:19.840 --> 37:20.840
That's way too hard.

37:20.840 --> 37:23.840
Breaking in, we were following this earlier just an hour ago.

37:23.840 --> 37:26.840
And the stock market was only down 600 points, which is still big.

37:26.840 --> 37:32.840
It dropped 1600 points today, which is one of the biggest drops ever.

37:32.840 --> 37:39.840
And then rebounded 800 points, but it's still 800 points down.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.840
Doug, you talk about deep state operations.

37:41.840 --> 37:45.840
You talk about Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, they've been working against the president.

37:45.840 --> 37:49.840
Even though they've had record profits, they openly cheerlead for communist China.

37:49.840 --> 37:52.840
This is the type of craziness we've been saying will come.

37:52.840 --> 38:01.840
Evidence is mounting that the mega fires in Australia are being orchestrated by multinational forces

38:01.840 --> 38:11.840
to clear out key corridors for future development and for light rail going in that's being financed by the communist Chinese.

38:11.840 --> 38:14.840
They are intending to remove Trump one way or another.

38:14.840 --> 38:20.840
And then they're going to trigger a civil war saying right wingers blew stuff up when Trump gets removed.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.840
They're going to truck bomb and mass shoot and say we did it.

38:23.840 --> 38:28.840
When they remove Trump, use that for a total clamp down.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.840
The economy is going to implode.

38:30.840 --> 38:33.840
There's going to be homeless running around crazy everywhere.

38:33.840 --> 38:41.840
All they got to do is have the Chinese who supply 90 percent of the opiates cut those off for about a month.

38:41.840 --> 38:43.840
And it's going to look like a zombie apocalypse.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.840
And remember, oh, Alex, you're a fairmonger.

38:45.840 --> 38:46.840
They'll never try to get our guns.

38:46.840 --> 38:47.840
And I said, you watch.

38:47.840 --> 38:49.840
There's going to be mass shootings.

38:49.840 --> 38:51.840
There's going to be false flags.

38:51.840 --> 38:54.840
A month before Sandy Hook.

38:54.840 --> 39:00.840
I said, this is the season. Get ready. I'm seeing them roll out the propaganda now beforehand.

39:00.840 --> 39:06.840
And so this is the type of time you're going to see bigger false flag event type things happen.

39:06.840 --> 39:17.840
But I can tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, that communist forces, that's what Antifa is in the Soros funded, Democrat Party funded combine,

39:17.840 --> 39:24.840
are planning assaults on new police stations and federal buildings tonight all across the United States.

39:24.840 --> 39:35.840
And when the Austin police bring photos and video of this to the mayor's office, they are told you are to stand down.

39:35.840 --> 39:40.840
I've seen the photos. I've seen the videos. I've seen the internal memorandums.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.840
This is happening for sure.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.840
We knew Governor Northam was going to try to declare an emergency.

39:44.840 --> 39:48.840
We knew he was going to try to hype it up like people with guns are coming to get them.

39:48.840 --> 39:51.840
And so he'll have to have a law enforcement response.

39:51.840 --> 39:59.840
Then they stage a false flag or they provocateur an action, Jesse Smollett style, but on steroids.

39:59.840 --> 40:05.840
And then they say, look, the gun owners are the evil terrorists or the white supremacists.

40:05.840 --> 40:11.840
And they run the same operation we saw the Democrat controlled state police did a couple of years ago in Charlottesville.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.840
And they have launched more and more escalations.

40:14.840 --> 40:22.840
And the next escalation is assassinating the president or staging giant terror attacks and blaming it on the right wing patriots.

40:22.840 --> 40:23.840
And they're going to do it.

40:23.840 --> 40:31.840
And are we just going to sit here while the Clintons and the Obamas load up a fuel truck again and blow up a federal building?

40:31.840 --> 40:36.840
Are we just going to sit here while they go and shoot up a black church with some mental patient?

40:36.840 --> 40:42.840
They got wound up on psychotropics and amphetamines and amnesiacs in a hotel room right now.

40:42.840 --> 40:46.840
They got brainwashed loony tuners everywhere ready to go.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.840
They punch a couple buttons.

40:48.840 --> 40:56.840
It's over. There's no way to stop their false flags unless the leadership of the globalist is dealt with.

40:56.840 --> 40:58.840
You know what? It's real, folks.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.840
There's nothing fake here.

41:00.840 --> 41:02.840
In fact, I'm so damn real, I can't stand it.

41:02.840 --> 41:03.840
I sometimes want to control myself.

41:03.840 --> 41:05.840
I sometimes want to act a different way.

41:05.840 --> 41:08.840
I can't. I can't control myself.

41:08.840 --> 41:11.840
I'm a maniac. It's all real. I'm totally real.

41:11.840 --> 41:14.840
I've never lied to you.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.840
I compulsively tell the truth.

41:17.840 --> 41:21.840
And these people out there, they can't stand that, you see.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.840
And they also don't like the fact they can't scare me.

41:23.840 --> 41:24.840
And they don't like the fact they can't scare you.

41:24.840 --> 41:26.840
But let me just tell you.

41:26.840 --> 41:29.840
I've studied war propaganda and how the globalists do stuff.

41:29.840 --> 41:35.840
Folks, I think they are probably...

41:35.840 --> 41:39.840
I need to go to your calls, but I need to probably do a special report so I don't cut into the main broadcast time on your calls.

41:39.840 --> 41:45.840
But I think they're getting ready to do a false flag and blame me and they might kill me.

41:45.840 --> 41:48.840
And I'm only saying that to be dramatic.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.840
And if that happens, I'm not a loser. I'm a winner.

41:50.840 --> 41:52.840
I don't want to die, by the way. I'm not going to commit suicide.

41:52.840 --> 41:53.840
But you know what I mean.

41:53.840 --> 41:58.840
I think they could do a nuclear false flag dirty bomb or nuclear attack.

41:58.840 --> 42:00.840
Oh, don't put it past them to kill Trump.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.840
It takes out Trump. Exactly.

42:02.840 --> 42:08.840
It takes out Trump. They blame it on patriots or they blame it on Trump's negotiations with North Korea.

42:08.840 --> 42:10.840
They could say it's North Korea fighting back against...

42:10.840 --> 42:11.840
Or Iran.

42:11.840 --> 42:12.840
Or Iran, exactly.

42:12.840 --> 42:17.840
But they take out Trump and they take out 200,000 Americans at the same time and then they blame conservatives.

42:17.840 --> 42:23.840
And then they use that to blacklist all conservatives, all speech online and any dissenting views.

42:23.840 --> 42:24.840
This is the plan.

42:24.840 --> 42:28.840
This is the plan. They have to silence you, Alex. And they have to silence me before...

42:28.840 --> 42:35.840
Exactly. They wouldn't be taking the risk to shut us down when it wakes everybody up with the Streisand effect if they weren't at a gut level.

42:35.840 --> 42:39.840
I know. I think well before the election, they're going to hit us. And I agree.

42:39.840 --> 42:43.840
I think it's going to be a biological or a nuclear event.

42:43.840 --> 42:45.840
But I think they want nuclear to kill POTUS.

42:45.840 --> 42:50.840
If they nuke a city which is in their plans, it's in their cards.

42:50.840 --> 42:55.840
If they nuke a city and say Patriots did it, you know the hammer just dropped.

42:55.840 --> 42:57.840
And they're going to try to come arrest me, you name it.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.840
I know these murderers.

42:59.840 --> 43:06.840
Just like two people are seen running away from the scene in Sandy Hook.

43:06.840 --> 43:08.840
And then you find a guy shot in the head inside.

43:08.840 --> 43:11.840
You go have a drill. You shoot your mental and patient patsy in the head.

43:11.840 --> 43:12.840
You get out.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.840
I mean this is the oldest. This is a false flag.

43:14.840 --> 43:20.840
And so the next attack, a bioweapon ten times worse?

43:20.840 --> 43:23.840
A nuke in D.C. during the State of the Union?

43:23.840 --> 43:26.840
I mean Congress shouldn't be in session in the buildings.

43:26.840 --> 43:28.840
The President should never be in D.C. now.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.840
He should be moving around the country.

43:30.840 --> 43:33.840
I mean we're in a total war, people.

43:33.840 --> 43:39.840
And if this is proven to not be a false flag, which I think has gone from 1% chance to maybe 5% chance,

43:39.840 --> 43:43.840
I will eat my hat and apologize and be very pleased.

43:43.840 --> 43:44.840
Please eat your hat.

43:44.840 --> 43:46.840
Yeah, please eat that hat.

43:46.840 --> 43:51.840
Yeah, I feel like that was a little bit long, but the reason I made it that long is because I want to drive home this point.

43:51.840 --> 43:52.840
Yeah.

43:52.840 --> 43:53.840
The point is made.

43:53.840 --> 43:55.840
I'm pretty sure it's driven home.

43:55.840 --> 43:56.840
Yeah.

43:56.840 --> 43:58.840
This is what he does.

43:58.840 --> 44:01.840
This is not a prediction that Alex is making.

44:01.840 --> 44:04.840
It's an obsession and a centerpiece of his worldview.

44:04.840 --> 44:12.840
On some level, he knows that his political alignment is just full of cosplaying militia weirdos who lust after the opportunity to commit acts of violence that they can justify as being necessary

44:12.840 --> 44:15.840
to water the tree of liberty or whatever.

44:15.840 --> 44:25.840
He knows that, so the only real options he can do, he can either applaud terrorist acts, domestic terrorist acts, which is tough, or you pretend they don't exist.

44:25.840 --> 44:27.840
If you go the first option, it's a little risky.

44:27.840 --> 44:33.840
Eventually you'll end up ostracizing yourself, even from the pseudo-acceptable world of the fringe.

44:33.840 --> 44:36.840
The second option just requires a mantra you drill into your audience.

44:36.840 --> 44:44.840
In this case, if there's an act of terrorism that looks like it could have been carried out by someone who believes the same shit as me, it's fake until proven otherwise.

44:44.840 --> 44:55.840
It's the evil nebulous group I'm fighting that's just trying to make me look bad, so ignore it and keep pushing deeper into the fanatical world that accepts, rationalizes, and excuses this kind of activity.

44:55.840 --> 45:02.840
And that has nothing to do with what the actual end result of what this event was.

45:02.840 --> 45:06.840
It doesn't matter, Alex's response is going to be to call it fake.

45:06.840 --> 45:08.840
So it was always going to be a fake.

45:08.840 --> 45:11.840
On the off chance that it's something that could implicate his beliefs.

45:11.840 --> 45:12.840
Totally.

45:12.840 --> 45:16.840
And that's just, it's very boring.

45:16.840 --> 45:19.840
It is boring, and it's disheartening.

45:19.840 --> 45:20.840
Yes.

45:20.840 --> 45:23.840
It's really disheartening, and it's unfair.

45:23.840 --> 45:31.840
You can set your watch by right-wing terrorism and so he gets to run interference whenever he wants because it's going to happen, you know?

45:31.840 --> 45:32.840
Yeah.

45:32.840 --> 45:33.840
It's so fucking annoying.

45:33.840 --> 45:42.840
Yeah, and at its core, the narrative here, this false flag narrative, the way that Alex uses it is just a way of weaponizing and making money off denial.

45:42.840 --> 45:43.840
Yep.

45:43.840 --> 45:51.840
That's just what you're doing, and it's, like I said, when I say it's boring, I mean it's really boring when you look at it in the long view.

45:51.840 --> 45:52.840
Yeah, totally.

45:52.840 --> 46:03.840
You look at his career and recognize all this dumb shit you keep saying is researched, I study the globalists, I know their patterns, and then every fucking pattern is wrong.

46:03.840 --> 46:06.840
Nothing ends up happening that he says is going to happen.

46:06.840 --> 46:08.840
And then you, but it's not boring.

46:08.840 --> 46:10.840
The trick itself is not boring.

46:10.840 --> 46:11.840
Right.

46:11.840 --> 46:15.840
The trick itself is possibly very dangerous.

46:15.840 --> 46:16.840
Yeah.

46:16.840 --> 46:23.840
Because the first time you're exposed to the idea of a false flag and that it's not just something that only exists in fiction.

46:23.840 --> 46:24.840
Sure.

46:24.840 --> 46:26.840
Like, it does make you think, like, oh my god, everything could be.

46:26.840 --> 46:27.840
Yeah.

46:27.840 --> 46:32.840
And that's the danger of that tripwire Alex can set out in front of you.

46:32.840 --> 46:34.840
It's the same thing that happened to Rogan.

46:34.840 --> 46:41.840
When Rogan talks to Alex about the only things that he thinks Alex has been right about, it's like, oh, you told me that agent provocateurs exist.

46:41.840 --> 46:44.840
So, like, yes, okay, great, your mind was blown by that.

46:44.840 --> 46:45.840
Yeah.

46:45.840 --> 46:48.840
And the mind-blowing event was used for malicious purposes.

46:48.840 --> 46:57.840
And I think that Alex knows on some level, no matter how stupid this conspiracy is about this bombing on Christmas,

46:57.840 --> 47:06.840
no matter how lacking in connective tissue it is, no matter how sad it looks to look at, it might blow someone's mind.

47:06.840 --> 47:07.840
Yeah.

47:07.840 --> 47:13.840
There might be someone that all they need to hear is a denial of some reality that's in their face.

47:13.840 --> 47:14.840
So infuriating.

47:14.840 --> 47:16.840
Yeah, you can make two bucks off that.

47:16.840 --> 47:26.840
It's, like, the thing that weirds me out, it's so much less believable because every right-wing terror attack is a false flag.

47:26.840 --> 47:31.840
You know, look, I get it, Putin won 97% of the vote.

47:31.840 --> 47:32.840
Sure.

47:32.840 --> 47:33.840
Sure he did.

47:33.840 --> 47:41.840
Alright, 99% of all of these right-wing terror attacks that are people doing the things you say they should do.

47:41.840 --> 47:42.840
Politically.

47:42.840 --> 47:43.840
Politically.

47:43.840 --> 47:45.840
99% of them are all false flags?

47:45.840 --> 47:46.840
99%.

47:46.840 --> 47:47.840
Come on, man.

47:47.840 --> 47:48.840
And, uh...

47:48.840 --> 47:50.840
At least be like the Oklahoma City bombing with him.

47:50.840 --> 47:55.840
Well, and 99% of things that you make up that don't happen are also false flags.

47:55.840 --> 47:56.840
Yeah, exactly!

47:56.840 --> 47:57.840
Yes!

47:57.840 --> 47:58.840
It's...

47:58.840 --> 47:59.840
Come on, man!

47:59.840 --> 48:01.840
Give me 60-40 at least.

48:01.840 --> 48:02.840
Yeah, yeah.

48:02.840 --> 48:03.840
Something.

48:03.840 --> 48:04.840
It's...

48:04.840 --> 48:09.840
But he can't muddy the waters because then you're not sure that they're all false flags.

48:09.840 --> 48:10.840
Right, right.

48:10.840 --> 48:11.840
You know, or you're not sure which ones are false flags.

48:11.840 --> 48:15.840
Okay, and it comes down to the limitation of his abilities, and that is that once you

48:15.840 --> 48:20.840
introduce the idea of, like, real critical thinking that you engage in with the audience

48:20.840 --> 48:25.840
and allow the audience to engage in, if you're like, well, maybe this is a false flag.

48:25.840 --> 48:27.840
I don't know, let's see.

48:27.840 --> 48:32.840
You can't accidentally encourage your audience to start questioning and you don't want them to do that.

48:32.840 --> 48:33.840
And you cannot have that.

48:33.840 --> 48:34.840
Because your shit is thin.

48:34.840 --> 48:35.840
Any doubt is terror.

48:35.840 --> 48:36.840
It's religion.

48:36.840 --> 48:38.840
Any doubt will fuck you up.

48:38.840 --> 48:42.840
Yeah, yeah, and that's why Alex can say, like, there's a chance that this is real, and then

48:42.840 --> 48:44.840
20 seconds later be like, the deep state did this bomb.

48:44.840 --> 48:45.840
Yeah, totally, totally.

48:45.840 --> 48:49.840
So you give the appearance of questioning and the appearance of critical thinking while

48:49.840 --> 48:51.840
at the same time driving home your predetermined conclusion.

48:51.840 --> 48:52.840
Yep.

48:52.840 --> 48:54.840
It's just unfounded.

48:54.840 --> 48:55.840
So unfair.

48:55.840 --> 48:57.840
So, it has all the signatures, man.

48:57.840 --> 49:00.840
It has all the signatures of a false flag.

49:00.840 --> 49:01.840
There's a signature.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.840
There's a pattern to false flags.

49:03.840 --> 49:09.840
And at the preliminary stages, this fits perfectly into that historical paradigm.

49:09.840 --> 49:16.840
But regardless, authoritarian elements of the system will try to use this event to take more Americans' liberties.

49:16.840 --> 49:22.840
The Democratic Party and their deep state controllers have given us years of looting and destruction

49:22.840 --> 49:25.840
as a message to the courts and the system.

49:25.840 --> 49:30.840
If you don't give us what we want, if you don't let us steal the election and stall Joe Biden

49:30.840 --> 49:35.840
and let China complete its takeover, we will burn every city to the ground.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.840
If I were Alex, I would avoid using the word regardless.

49:37.840 --> 49:38.840
Yeah.

49:38.840 --> 49:42.840
Because he's like, yes, this has all the marks of a false flag, but regardless.

49:42.840 --> 49:43.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:43.840 --> 49:44.840
Don't hand-wave that.

49:44.840 --> 49:45.840
Yeah, I don't know.

49:45.840 --> 49:47.840
Makes me think that you're not saying shit.

49:47.840 --> 49:48.840
Yeah.

49:48.840 --> 49:50.840
Yada, yada, yada.

49:50.840 --> 49:51.840
Moving on.

49:51.840 --> 49:58.840
And he gets to, like, his closing thoughts, which is his refrain that he says on pretty

49:58.840 --> 50:03.840
much every time he wants to say something stupid about a world event that people are

50:03.840 --> 50:05.840
emotionally affected by.

50:05.840 --> 50:08.840
And that is, hey, I got the right to question things.

50:08.840 --> 50:09.840
Americans can question things.

50:09.840 --> 50:10.840
Sure.

50:10.840 --> 50:13.840
And again, this is not questioning.

50:13.840 --> 50:19.840
But in closing, never forget the long history of governments and other organizations staging

50:19.840 --> 50:22.840
false flag terror attacks to blander political opposition.

50:22.840 --> 50:28.840
And remember, it's the American birthright to be able to research and question any public

50:28.840 --> 50:29.840
event.

50:29.840 --> 50:31.840
I mean, yeah, research and question whatever you want.

50:31.840 --> 50:32.840
This isn't that.

50:32.840 --> 50:33.840
Yeah.

50:33.840 --> 50:34.840
This is bullshit.

50:34.840 --> 50:35.840
That's a little bit different.

50:35.840 --> 50:36.840
Yeah.

50:36.840 --> 50:40.840
It is your birthright to research and question things, but it is not your birthright to go

50:40.840 --> 50:42.840
on the radio and tell people that it was a false flag.

50:42.840 --> 50:43.840
Right.

50:43.840 --> 50:48.840
I feel like that's not a, I don't know if George Washington was hanging out being like,

50:48.840 --> 50:53.840
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Eventually we're going to invent the radio.

50:53.840 --> 50:54.840
I have a laissez faire.

50:54.840 --> 50:58.840
I have a difficult time thinking that, I mean, first of all, I don't know.

50:58.840 --> 51:02.840
I don't want to get into a first amendment debate, but I don't think it's responsible

51:02.840 --> 51:08.840
at questioning behavior or, you know, like something that has a lot of value in society

51:08.840 --> 51:13.840
for someone to just get on the radio and with no evidence be like the deep state did this.

51:13.840 --> 51:15.840
That's stupid.

51:15.840 --> 51:17.840
That can only lead to negative outcomes.

51:17.840 --> 51:18.840
Yeah.

51:18.840 --> 51:24.840
I mean, regardless of what he's saying, regardless of any of that stuff, when you say I am only

51:24.840 --> 51:28.840
researching and questioning, that is a bad faith lie.

51:28.840 --> 51:31.840
So I don't give a shit about what you're talking about.

51:31.840 --> 51:32.840
It's a deflection.

51:32.840 --> 51:34.840
I don't, this isn't even a first amendment conversation.

51:34.840 --> 51:39.840
This is a, I can toss away your bullshit because you are already lying to me.

51:39.840 --> 51:40.840
Yeah.

51:40.840 --> 51:41.840
You know?

51:41.840 --> 51:42.840
So fuck you.

51:42.840 --> 51:48.840
His enclosing statement is things have happened before and I can get away with this.

51:48.840 --> 51:52.840
So please give some credence to what I'm saying.

51:52.840 --> 51:57.840
Meanwhile, the like, it's just, just, uh, just, uh, I can't even, I can't even come

51:57.840 --> 51:58.840
up with words other than weak.

51:58.840 --> 51:59.840
It's just nothing.

51:59.840 --> 52:01.840
It's conspiracy is nothing.

52:01.840 --> 52:02.840
Yeah.

52:02.840 --> 52:03.840
It's so disappointing.

52:03.840 --> 52:04.840
It's boring.

52:04.840 --> 52:08.840
We have one last clip here as Alex closes out the report where he wants to make you

52:08.840 --> 52:10.840
afraid of Eric Holder.

52:10.840 --> 52:11.840
Damn right.

52:11.840 --> 52:16.840
Never forget that Joe Biden and his would be incoming crew of criminals are part of

52:16.840 --> 52:18.840
the Obama crime organization.

52:18.840 --> 52:23.840
Never forget it was deputy attorney general Eric Holder who helped cover up what really

52:23.840 --> 52:29.340
happened in Oklahoma city in 1995 the same holder carried out the giant confirmed false

52:29.340 --> 52:33.840
flag operation of fast and furious.

52:33.840 --> 52:37.120
Okay.

52:37.120 --> 52:42.040
Alex sounds so self-satisfied when he says fast and furious at the end there.

52:42.040 --> 52:46.040
Uh, I'm going to put that one in the wind column guys cut right there.

52:46.040 --> 52:50.400
Eric Holder even need talks to be in Biden's administration.

52:50.400 --> 52:51.400
Who cares?

52:51.400 --> 52:52.400
He's not.

52:52.400 --> 52:54.080
I haven't heard his name come up.

52:54.080 --> 52:58.560
Rahm Emanuel's name has come up more than Eric Holder's and he should be tossed into

52:58.560 --> 52:59.560
a fucking cannon.

52:59.560 --> 53:03.040
I feel like Alex just doesn't have many specifics left and he's like, oh, I remember how fun

53:03.040 --> 53:04.880
it was to make people scared of Eric Holder.

53:04.880 --> 53:06.720
Let's get back on that.

53:06.720 --> 53:11.840
So I was really struck by how weak and desperate that special report that Alex put out is.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.160
It's absolutely meaningless.

53:13.160 --> 53:14.880
There's no teeth behind it at all.

53:14.880 --> 53:18.260
I almost kind of felt when I was listening to it that he didn't have a theory, but he

53:18.260 --> 53:22.920
wanted to yell into the void to remind people that he's weird and he's willing to call everything

53:22.920 --> 53:25.920
fake with or without reason and he's ready to do it immediately.

53:25.920 --> 53:26.920
Yeah.

53:26.920 --> 53:29.200
He's almost putting out a beacon like the lighthouse is lit guys.

53:29.200 --> 53:30.920
I'm out here.

53:30.920 --> 53:31.920
There's no theory here.

53:31.920 --> 53:35.540
There's nothing except knee jerk denialism, which Alex attempts to justify by pointing

53:35.540 --> 53:39.480
to unrelated rants he went on two and a half years ago about how the media was going to

53:39.480 --> 53:44.160
false flag themselves, something that barely even makes sense with the details of the bombing.

53:44.160 --> 53:48.520
It's unconvincing, it's flat, and it's also couched in so much I'm not saying I'm just

53:48.520 --> 53:52.560
saying kind of language that it's hard to even imagine him caring about this.

53:52.560 --> 53:57.060
Reckless abandon is easy to mistake for passion, but attempts to cover your own ass preemptively

53:57.060 --> 53:58.720
just feel hollow.

53:58.720 --> 54:03.080
I was curious about QAnon was doing with this bombing, so I reached out to Travis over at

54:03.080 --> 54:06.800
QAnon Anonymous and he directed me to some of the theories that have popped up and gained

54:06.800 --> 54:08.540
traction in that world.

54:08.540 --> 54:10.800
They're all nuts, but they're better than Alex.

54:10.800 --> 54:11.800
Okay.

54:11.800 --> 54:15.120
They seem to have theories that surround the idea that there was like a secret NSA server

54:15.120 --> 54:19.380
at the AT&T building that would somehow prove that the Georgia election fraud conspiracies

54:19.380 --> 54:20.380
were true.

54:20.380 --> 54:24.200
So the bombing was actually the good guys setting off a controlled detonation to recover

54:24.200 --> 54:28.200
the evidence and stop Biden from getting into office or possibly to prevent the bad guys

54:28.200 --> 54:32.800
from being able to steal the upcoming run runoff election in Georgia.

54:32.800 --> 54:33.920
Dude.

54:33.920 --> 54:34.920
Next one.

54:34.920 --> 54:37.840
Obviously that's nonsense and it's flimsy as hell, but it makes sense with the larger

54:37.840 --> 54:41.340
conspiracies that are actually being engaged in in the QAnon world.

54:41.340 --> 54:42.340
That's fair.

54:42.340 --> 54:45.720
It fits the needs of the audience that QAnon has captured, whereas Alex's narrative is

54:45.720 --> 54:50.360
just dull and uninspired as well as almost entirely disconnected from anything else he's

54:50.360 --> 54:54.560
been yelling about except for the fact that false flags are coming, which I stress he

54:54.560 --> 54:55.560
does all the time.

54:55.560 --> 54:57.480
Do you want me to play that six minutes again?

54:57.480 --> 54:58.720
Do not, sir.

54:58.720 --> 54:59.720
I won't.

54:59.720 --> 55:02.720
And he doesn't even feel into it.

55:02.720 --> 55:04.160
No, he doesn't feel into it.

55:04.160 --> 55:05.520
He's not selling it.

55:05.520 --> 55:06.520
You got it.

55:06.520 --> 55:08.520
Look, if you got weak material, you got to sell it.

55:08.520 --> 55:12.180
You know, that's the one thing that I've, I've learned from standup so long.

55:12.180 --> 55:16.280
If you got weak material, you perform the shit out of that material and maybe you'll

55:16.280 --> 55:22.040
skate by and help you push up the next level and this you got to elevate.

55:22.040 --> 55:23.040
Yeah.

55:23.040 --> 55:29.320
It's, it's almost like kind of, it has the feeling of a guy and like a, like a recliner

55:29.320 --> 55:37.440
doing like an, I told you so, but there's nothing there being told because that is kind

55:37.440 --> 55:38.440
of the idea.

55:38.440 --> 55:42.200
The, I told you so is him playing these clips from 2018 where he said that CNN was going

55:42.200 --> 55:43.200
to fall flat.

55:43.200 --> 55:44.200
Yeah.

55:44.200 --> 55:45.200
Yeah.

55:45.200 --> 55:48.440
This is like, it almost feels like a victory lap, but there was no victory.

55:48.440 --> 55:49.440
There wasn't even a race.

55:49.440 --> 55:50.440
No, that's true.

55:50.440 --> 55:51.440
Yeah.

55:51.440 --> 55:53.000
He should be petting a cat on his lap.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.860
Just like I told all of you what would happen.

55:55.860 --> 55:57.080
It's almost confusing.

55:57.080 --> 55:58.080
Yeah.

55:58.080 --> 56:03.640
It's almost disorienting how disconnected it is from anything that feels real or anything

56:03.640 --> 56:07.560
that even makes sense as like conspiracy fodder.

56:07.560 --> 56:11.200
Like that's, that's the thing that like when I was looking at these, these QAnon things

56:11.200 --> 56:15.600
that Travis pointed me towards, like I was looking at those and I was like, I get it.

56:15.600 --> 56:17.120
I get where this is going.

56:17.120 --> 56:18.120
Sure.

56:18.120 --> 56:19.120
Sure.

56:19.120 --> 56:21.280
Media wants to make themselves look like the victims.

56:21.280 --> 56:22.280
Yeah.

56:22.280 --> 56:23.280
What?

56:23.280 --> 56:24.280
Yeah.

56:24.280 --> 56:25.280
It just doesn't, it's, it's not,

56:25.280 --> 56:27.720
I think, I think on this one, the cement is too wet.

56:27.720 --> 56:30.400
The cement is too wet right now.

56:30.400 --> 56:34.880
I think this is going to be the first one where it's like in two days, everyone will

56:34.880 --> 56:37.040
have a much better conspiracy theory.

56:37.040 --> 56:38.580
They've had more time to workshop it.

56:38.580 --> 56:41.080
They got more details to play with.

56:41.080 --> 56:45.120
There just aren't enough, you know, like that's, that's the thing you, with the, the Boston

56:45.120 --> 56:48.560
bombing, they're all immediately, they're pictures, suspects.

56:48.560 --> 56:51.800
There's so many different people you could investigate and go down.

56:51.800 --> 56:55.400
And on this one it's like, I don't even know where to start yet.

56:55.400 --> 56:56.400
That kind of thing.

56:56.400 --> 57:00.200
So all these people are just coming up with downright nonsense.

57:00.200 --> 57:01.200
Yeah.

57:01.200 --> 57:07.280
And it's, it's in the like same like in-between period of an election and an inauguration

57:07.280 --> 57:11.400
and the recount, a runoff election as it were.

57:11.400 --> 57:13.960
And we got other shit going on.

57:13.960 --> 57:14.960
Yeah.

57:14.960 --> 57:15.960
Yeah.

57:15.960 --> 57:17.960
So much other shit to deal with.

57:17.960 --> 57:22.800
So I'm, I'm interested to see where Alex goes with this because I think, I mean, based on

57:22.800 --> 57:27.160
his behaviors, it seems like this is something that's going to have to be something he keeps

57:27.160 --> 57:28.160
going on.

57:28.160 --> 57:29.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:29.160 --> 57:32.360
And I'm interested to see what the narrative flashes out to be, whether he gets in line

57:32.360 --> 57:36.600
with the QAnon theories that are already much fuller than his.

57:36.600 --> 57:37.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:37.600 --> 57:38.600
Totally.

57:38.600 --> 57:41.600
Or if it becomes a, I don't know what it'll become.

57:41.600 --> 57:42.600
Anyway.

57:42.600 --> 57:43.600
I don't know.

57:43.600 --> 57:50.040
I just think that there's some value in taking a look at the immediate reaction that he has.

57:50.040 --> 57:51.040
Totally.

57:51.040 --> 57:52.040
I agree.

57:52.040 --> 57:57.000
I mean, you know, it's, he knew he had to do something.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
Yeah.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
And this is what he did.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
Exactly.

58:00.000 --> 58:04.680
It'll be a great document of what he said before he's going to say something different.

58:04.680 --> 58:05.680
You know?

58:05.680 --> 58:12.680
Like we have to at least, this is uninspired, but this is without question an easy receipt

58:12.680 --> 58:15.280
against tomorrow's bullshit, you know?

58:15.280 --> 58:16.280
Most likely.

58:16.280 --> 58:19.080
Maybe even today's bullshit, like that kind of level.

58:19.080 --> 58:20.080
Yeah.

58:20.080 --> 58:21.080
Yeah.

58:21.080 --> 58:22.080
Yeah.

58:22.080 --> 58:23.080
And hey, we'll be back.

58:23.080 --> 58:24.080
Oh, we will.

58:24.080 --> 58:25.080
Yeah.

58:25.080 --> 58:32.400
But please, my apologies if anybody felt anything that we discussed or any of our tone was flippant

58:32.400 --> 58:34.720
about the bombing.

58:34.720 --> 58:41.360
My heart goes out to everybody affected and I don't want you to think that, you know,

58:41.360 --> 58:46.080
my mocking Alex's theories are in any way meant to minimize the experience that people

58:46.080 --> 58:47.080
are having.

58:47.080 --> 58:48.080
Yeah.

58:48.080 --> 58:49.280
It's tougher, but we are not brutish.

58:49.280 --> 58:57.080
Life is not that brutal, so it is just fucking, what are you going to do?

58:57.080 --> 58:58.080
We'll be back.

58:58.080 --> 58:59.080
But until then, we have a website.

58:59.080 --> 59:00.080
We do have a website.

59:00.080 --> 59:01.080
It's knowledgefight.com.

59:01.080 --> 59:02.080
Yep.

59:02.080 --> 59:03.080
We're also on Twitter.

59:03.080 --> 59:04.080
We are on Twitter.

59:04.080 --> 59:05.080
It's at Knowledge Fight and at Go To Bed Jordan.

59:05.080 --> 59:06.080
We're also on Facebook.

59:06.080 --> 59:07.080
We are on Facebook.

59:07.080 --> 59:11.440
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

59:11.440 --> 59:12.600
doing God's work right now.

59:12.600 --> 59:13.600
Yeah.

59:13.600 --> 59:14.600
We'll be back.

59:14.600 --> 59:15.600
But until then, I'm Neo.

59:15.600 --> 59:16.600
I'm Leo.

59:16.600 --> 59:17.600
I'm DZX Clark.

59:17.600 --> 59:18.600
I'm Daryl Rundis.

59:18.600 --> 59:20.120
Thanks for listening to Alex Eat That Hat.

59:20.120 --> 59:21.720
He's got to eat that hat.

59:21.720 --> 59:23.400
He promised to eat the hat.

59:23.400 --> 59:24.400
Eat the hat, Alex.

59:24.400 --> 59:25.400
Andy in Kansas.

59:25.400 --> 59:26.400
You're on the air.

59:26.400 --> 59:27.400
Thanks for holding.

59:27.400 --> 59:28.400
Hello, Alex.

59:28.400 --> 59:29.400
I'm a first time caller.

59:29.400 --> 59:30.400
I'm a huge fan.

59:30.400 --> 59:31.400
I love your work.

59:31.400 --> 59:49.200
I love you.
