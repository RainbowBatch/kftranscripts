00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Knowledgefight, I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Knowledgefight.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Dan and Jordan.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Knowledgefight.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I need, I need money.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Andy in Kansas.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Andy in, Andy in.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Stop it.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Andy in, Andy in Kansas.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Andy in, Andy in.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's time to pray.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Andy in Kansas.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You're on the air.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Thanks for holding.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hello, Alex.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm a first time caller.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm a huge fan.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I love your room.

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000

00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I love you.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hey, everybody.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Welcome back to Knowledgefight.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm Dan.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm Jordan.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is not 2020.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No, it is not.

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes.

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Happy New Year.

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It is no longer here.

37
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
All the fine folks out there.

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Welcome one and all to a brand new year.

39
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Same old shit though, but it's a brand new year.

40
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Good riddance to old rubbish.

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
See y'all in hell.

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What I'll say about 2020.

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hey, bye.

45
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah.

46
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hey, this is a podcast where we like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
a little bit about Alex Jones.

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm Dan.

49
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Indeed we do.

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm Jordan.

51
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Have we said that already?

52
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I don't know.

53
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I threw off our rhythm.

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We're starting off with it a new way.

55
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Cut.

56
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No.

57
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah, here we are.

58
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Happy New Year.

59
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Dan.

60
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes.

61
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Dan.

62
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Jordan.

63
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Quick question.

64
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah.

65
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What's your bright spot, buddy?

66
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
My bright spot is actually going to have to wait until the shout outs to donors section

67
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
of the podcast, and you'll enjoy it then.

68
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
All right.

69
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But for now, I shall turn the question around on you.

70
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What is yours?

71
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Dan, my bright spot is my two lovely dogs.

72
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They're very cute.

73
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I enjoy-

74
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I begrudgingly say.

75
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
My new favorite pastime now is catching them in some sort of pose, taking a picture, and

76
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
then marking it up on my phone, and just drawing a fanciful little picture around it.

77
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It is my favorite thing to do.

78
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You've got to get those dogs on TikTok.

79
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What is TikTok?

80
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Teach them dances.

81
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But what is TikTok?

82
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't know.

83
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah, me neither, man.

84
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Too old.

85
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's not for us.

86
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No.

87
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's not for us.

88
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We would just ruin it if we were there.

89
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Get those dogs on Snapchat.

90
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Is Snapchat still a thing?

91
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't know.

92
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Never been on it.

93
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I have no idea.

94
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Me neither.

95
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oh, God.

96
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We're so old.

97
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Get them on Vine.

98
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Ah, Vine.

99
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's where I'm going to go.

100
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Is Quibi still available?

101
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I think I got a five-pitch deal with them.

102
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Get them a Quibi.

103
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Get them a Quibi.

104
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah.

105
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah.

106
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,520
I'll put them on Cameo and see what they have to say.

107
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,640
I think you run into ethical issues there.

108
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,280
I don't think that it's ethical.

109
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,120
Are there labor laws for dogs?

110
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,360
I do think that based on your politics, you should not exploit the labor of those dogs.

111
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
That's fair.

112
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
That's fair.

113
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,960
I got to get twin dogs so they only have to work four hours at a time, each of them.

114
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,000
If you redirected the money from the Cameos towards all dog-related treats, then maybe.

115
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,680
It may be, but it's still dicey territory.

116
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,080
Otherwise we're in child star territory there.

117
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,080
Well, that is a fine, bright spot, Jordan.

118
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
They're my favorites.

119
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,040
I'm glad you're having fun with those dogs.

120
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Delightful.

121
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,760
So today, Jordan, what we have in front of us is the first episode of 2021.

122
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,320
Yay.

123
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,160
And we're still in 2020 for this episode.

124
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
Well, yeah.

125
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,240
But we're going to go over December 28th and 29th.

126
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,200
That's Monday and Tuesday of last week, or I guess this week.

127
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,280
And that way we save the end of the year for Monday.

128
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:01,520
And then also it'll be in the lead up to Alex's going to Washington, DC on the 6th.

129
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
That's right.

130
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
They're still doing that.

131
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,680
So next week, there's a plan to go to DC for all that.

132
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
Wild.

133
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
So I figure we can-

134
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Third time's the charm, I guess.

135
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,800
We can close out 2020, see how Alex ended the year on Monday, and then check in on the

136
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,280
aftermath of that rally on Friday.

137
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
It'll be great.

138
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
And have a blast.

139
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,080
It'll be a real bummer if they win.

140
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,320
It'll be a bad rally for us.

141
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,680
It'll be a bad rally no matter what, I think.

142
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
That's fair.

143
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
That's fair.

144
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,940
So Jordan, before we get into this episode, a little bit of an extended, we have a number

145
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,900
of shout outs today, which is very exciting.

146
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,440
Some of this is for folks who have signed up and are supporting the show, which we very

147
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
much appreciate.

148
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,040
And some, one of them is a bright spot.

149
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Okay.

150
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,520
So first, this is not a bright spot.

151
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,720
I am saying this name with a gun to my head, metaphorically.

152
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,280
This is a dark spot.

153
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,980
Alex Jones' too-messant, moist penis.

154
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,980
Thank you so much.

155
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,980
You are now a policy wonk.

156
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,980
I'm a policy wonk.

157
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,480
I didn't want to say that.

158
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Yeah.

159
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Yeah.

160
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Yeah.

161
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Yeah.

162
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Yeah.

163
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,940
We do have, there are some flaws in our, we'll thank everybody plan.

164
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,680
There are some flaws that can be exploited.

165
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Yep.

166
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,340
Take that Jeffy or Jeffy, thank you so much.

167
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,080
You are now policy wonk.

168
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,580
I'm a policy wonk.

169
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,660
Thank you very much.

170
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,660
Thank you.

171
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,660
Next.

172
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,660
Frankie fresh.

173
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,660
Thank you so much.

174
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,660
You are now a policy wonk.

175
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,660
I'm a policy wonk.

176
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,660
Thank you very much.

177
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,660
Frankie fresh, moist penis.

178
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,660
Oh, I'm sorry.

179
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,660
Am I not supposed to do that?

180
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,840
Oh, I apologize.

181
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
Next.

182
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
Puff Danny.

183
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Thank you so much.

184
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
You are now policy wonk.

185
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
I'm a policy wonk.

186
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
Thank you.

187
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,840
Next.

188
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
Sammy.

189
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,960
Thank you so much.

190
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,600
You are now policy wonk.

191
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,680
Thanks Sammy. Thank you. Next, don't go into the future. It's hot there. Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk.

192
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,960
I'm a policy wonk. Thank you very much. Good advice for all of us. Sure. Yeah. Next, Nomad Adam. Thank you so much

193
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,160
You're now a policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Thanks, Nomadum. Ooh. Aha!

194
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Combined him. Yeah. And finally, I'd like to say thank you to someone donated on an elevated level. We appreciate that very much

195
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,800
This is very important. Cisco is reverse flash. Thank you so much. You are now a technocrat. I'm a policy wonk.

196
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,480
Crikey, mate. That's fantastic. Have yourself a brew. How's your 401k doing, bro?

197
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,480
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright? Let's just get down to business.

198
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,040
We ain't making that money off that heroin. Why are you pimps so good? My neck is freakishly large.

199
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,960
I declare info war on you. Thank you so much. Cisco is reverse flash. Yes, thank you very much.

200
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:38,040
Jordan, we have a couple of special things here. Of course. First, gotta say a very special birthday

201
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:44,600
shout out to Bjorn L. Okay, happy birthday. Thank you for listening to the show and shooting us a message.

202
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Yes. Also, happy anniversary. Getting married on the first, right? Getting married on the first? Craziness.

203
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,240
Oh, that's out of control. I guess you'll never forget your anniversary if it's on the first.

204
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,840
It's cheating. It's cheating. Come on, man. It's cheating. Nah, nah. Get married on the second.

205
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,280
I still think that would be easy to remember. I honestly think it would probably be, I've not been married,

206
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,240
but I think it would be probably, it's not as hard as like sitcoms make it seem to remember your anniversary.

207
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:20,520
No, no, no. It's not that bad. Oh, no. Not again. That happened in every show. Yeah. Multiple times.

208
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,640
Yeah, but it's still never going to beat out the going on two dates in the same restaurant. Sure.

209
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:31,720
That's the best one there's ever been. That was a good gag. Every show for 20 years had one of those.

210
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:39,720
It's fantastic. So, happy anniversary to Ryan and Anne Randomly. Oh, happy anniversary. Yeah, happy

211
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:48,680
anniversary to you both. Yes, indeed. It would be weird to only wish one of you out. So, I insist on sending this message to both of you.

212
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,720
Happy anniversary to one and get out of that relationship to the other. No, no, no. Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

213
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,640
So now, here's my bright spot, Jordan. What's that? This is something that is going to blow minds from here to Scandinavia.

214
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:07,560
Scandinavia. Yes. Scandinavian minds too. So, I got two messages in the past little bit

215
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:15,160
from people who are trying to set up shout outs for their significant other. Sure. But unbeknownst

216
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:22,440
to either of them, they have both messaged me. We did not O'Henry someone. We did not O'Henry.

217
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:29,640
How dare you O'Henry us? Who are you? This is a coordinated attack. This was- We got O'Henry.

218
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:36,440
Elizabeth from Sweden, Axel sent me a message to give you a shout out to say that you're a policy wonk.

219
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,600
Axel from Sweden, Elizabeth sent me a message asking to give you a shout out and that you

220
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:49,080
would go crazy. And you both, you must both shave your heads now. That is the rule. Both of you must

221
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,840
shave your heads and buy each other combs. Let's go all the way in. I just found that to be-

222
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,480
That's the most delightful thing that I can think of. Yeah, and I hope both of your minds are blown.

223
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,880
Yeah, that's a bright spot for me too, Dan. Yeah, it's just- Fuck my dogs. I'm getting rid of them. I

224
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,560
just want to think about this for the rest of my life. What a way to start the year. That is great.

225
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah. That is great. It's wholesome. Super wholesome. I hope it's a nice surprise for them. Cute as shit.

226
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,320
Yep. And Elizabeth from Sweden and Axel from Sweden, you're both policy wonks. I'm a policy wonk.

227
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,960
Thank you both for brightening my week. Yes, thank you very much. It was great.

228
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:29,560
I can't imagine listening to this. You would have to be really, really deep in it if you listen to

229
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:36,440
that part of our show and we're like, no fun. No, I don't like it. My heart isn't warmed by that.

230
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:43,160
I'm bitter as shit and I'm going to cry. I think some people just hit the 15 seconds ahead.

231
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,560
None of this bullshit. Yeah, it's our version of ads. Yeah, yeah, basically. So, Jordan,

232
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,600
like I said, December 28th and 29th. Yes, sir, Dan. Here we go. We're jumping in on Monday.

233
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:01,800
All right. And this is where Alex is starting off. Start your engines, my friends. It's Monday,

234
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:09,160
December 28th. The year is 2020. We have several very informative guests that are going to be

235
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:15,240
joining us coming up today. Do we? And I'm going to lay out just exactly where we are on planet

236
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,640
Earth in the fight against the globalist. Austin. But first, President Trump over the weekend

237
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:26,600
tweeted out a very powerful video titled Man in America 2020 has been a year like no other.

238
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,280
Here is that report. So this report that Alex is citing that Trump tweeted out is not what

239
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:38,040
you would call a report. That term's being used real loosely. Okay. In reality, it's a video

240
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,840
about how the election was stolen, created by a guy named Seth Holhouse, who runs a website

241
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,720
called Man in America. I wanted to learn a little bit more about this guy. So I went to his website

242
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,600
and I noticed a few things that I thought were interesting. Two big things popped up about his

243
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:59,640
URL, which is mia.news. The first is that MIA stands for missing in action. So that kind of

244
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,280
gives off the exact opposite vibe that this guy's probably hoping to put out there. It's time for

245
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:10,760
all good patriots to show up. So please remember you can find me at MIA. I might've chosen a

246
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,240
different name, different acronym. Like for instance, I might've gone with American

247
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,000
withstanding outside legions. No problem with that one. That one's good. All right. The other

248
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,880
thing that popped up was this guy had a dot news URL and pretty much the only people I've ever seen

249
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,520
getting dot news pages are InfoWars associates. I'm sure some other people are doing it too,

250
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,560
but it's become something I associate so much with Alex and his crew that I instinctually suspect

251
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:43,720
something is not right if it has a dot news address. It might've been slightly unexpected

252
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,600
that this video went as viral as it did after Trump tweeted it out because according to an

253
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,960
article by Will Summer in the Daily Beast, some interesting things started to happen recently.

254
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,240
In particular, it appears that references online to Whole House being a member of the Falun Gong

255
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,320
movement began to be erased, including a mention of his appearance at a 2007 Minnesota conference

256
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,840
on the website Clear Harmony and all mentions of him on MingHui.org. Why would they want that

257
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,480
scrubbed? He also apparently, this has not necessarily been scrubbed from the internet,

258
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,000
but he was employed by the Epoch Times, a right-wing media outlet associated with Falun Gong

259
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,920
between 2008 and 2015, but he's apparently also freelanced as a photographer for them as recently

260
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,320
as July of this year. Great, great. Good stuff. Everybody's got to work. Freelance is tough.

261
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,600
This is not an individual who made a news report that's super powerful. It's the product of a

262
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:43,240
longtime employee of a deeply right-wing propaganda media outlet that essentially deifies Trump.

263
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,960
The removal of Whole House's name from those websites is kind of telling and the most likely

264
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,520
explanation for why it happened is because the propaganda video featured him as the narrator

265
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,160
and it doesn't work nearly as well as if you know that he's the member of a spiritual movement that

266
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,640
reportedly views Trump as a critical ally in the coming judgment day where communists will be sent

267
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,080
to hell. There is that. According to former Epoch Times employees speaking to the NBC News. There

268
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,440
is that, yeah. That does kind of mess with your credibility a hair. Right, you like the presentation

269
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,240
of the man in America. Just the American flag behind him. It's all just, you know. So it's less

270
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,520
a media report and more a book report on Behold Apparel Horse. Yeah. The charade works better when

271
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,640
you just believe that Whole House is what he presents himself to be. From his website to his

272
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,840
bio, quote, born and raised in the countryside of Ohio, I never thought I would see a time when our

273
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,800
freedoms were under attack like they are today. I spent the last 15 years fighting against the

274
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,760
tyranny of communism in China, but never did I imagine that that fight would come to American

275
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,880
soil. My heart beats with the blood of a patriot and I would rather die fighting than kneel down

276
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,240
in shame. I created Man in America to speak to my fellow patriots and help educate, inspire,

277
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,760
and unite us. All right, all I just heard was a lot of ravens like screeching in my ears,

278
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:07,080
like that's all I heard was like, it's sort of an angry mix between Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Charlie

279
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:13,160
Brown's teacher. Yeah, I've never written a good bio for myself, but I've always strayed about as

280
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,680
far away from self-mythologizing as I possibly could. This kind of reminds me of that advertising

281
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,120
dude who created the Frank Bates persona to sell survival food and prepper supplies to conservatives.

282
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,960
Yeah. Because he knew that the pitch would sound more attractive coming from a normal everyday

283
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,840
kind of fellow like Frank, even though he didn't exist, compared to the reality of it being a,

284
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,680
you know, just bullshit being resold to them by an affiliate marketing billionaire who lives

285
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:43,160
like in New York. It does not, yeah. It's a, it's a, it's a sort of puppet game. Yeah, it's a,

286
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,520
it's tricking flyover states. Anyway, I bring this up to remind everyone that Alex Jones considers

287
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:55,320
this a news report. What he's doing is just desperately chasing the actual new alternative

288
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:02,120
propaganda media, folks with associations with like Epoch Times or OAN and Newsmax until like

289
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,320
a week or two ago. And they admitted that Biden won the election. Also, it appears that Alex

290
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,600
really didn't want to work on this episode because other than introducing that special report,

291
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,600
he doesn't get back into the studio until 20 minutes into the episode. That's very fun.

292
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:23,320
He just plays stuff. I appreciate that. Yeah. Have we definitively proven that Falun Gong is

293
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,200
wrong though? Are they still, is it, are they still in the running for the end of day's winner?

294
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:35,480
I don't know nearly enough about that as a group to speak with any kind of authority or credibility.

295
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:43,720
Sure. But so I can't, I can't say, you know, like if, if like their point is solely that China is

296
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:50,920
repressive of groups, I don't disagree with that point. Yeah. But I don't think that groups like

297
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,440
the Epoch Times are on the up and up. Yeah. I was being facetious. I don't think all communists

298
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,120
are going to go to hell. I just don't think that's going to end up happening in the next,

299
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,760
I don't think, even if it does, I don't think Trump is your ally. Probably not. I would say

300
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,840
he's not the one you want to go. I also feel like he's going to very shortly become a less

301
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:17,080
effective ally. Let's hope. We can only hope. Yeah. So Alex gets, gets in, you know, he's,

302
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,360
he's, he's quite a ways into the episode before he really says anything substantial.

303
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,600
So let me give the number out to respond to Trump signing the.

304
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,360
Declaration of, what? Emergency relief bill. It's really just a foreign globalist port

305
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,640
barrel operation where the pardons or any of that, you're welcome to call in and we can all

306
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,760
get our brownie points with Twitter and Facebook criticizing Trump. But that all really becomes a

307
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:48,680
distraction from the world government, Bill Gates, the UN, the forced inoculations, the COVID systems,

308
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,800
Joe Biden. I honestly can't tell if Alex is mad at Trump about the relief bill or not.

309
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,840
No, it doesn't seem like he. I can tell that he's going to be mad at callers if they're

310
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,560
mad at Trump about it though. I can tell that for sure. They're just trying to get Twitter brownie

311
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,120
points, man. Yeah. Another thing that I was struck by listening to this is like, we're almost 30

312
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,080
minutes into the show and granted Alex wasn't on air for most of it, but one of the lead stories

313
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,880
isn't the Christmas morning bombing in Nashville that he interrupted his holiday to declare an

314
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,680
almost certain false flag. Shouldn't there be a follow-up on that? Like Owen hosted the show on

315
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,920
Sunday, so Alex didn't cover it then. So it seems like now would be a good time to do this a little

316
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:32,200
bit more responsibly. Oh no, it happened a couple of days ago. You don't need to worry about it.

317
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,680
I already forgot. So he doesn't get to this immediately. That's not the lead story. The

318
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:44,520
lead story appears to be Trump should not leave office. I don't like that story. Inauguration

319
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,840
is in 23 days. The coronation of the shy comm puppet there's they've built the stage there.

320
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,040
Biden says he's not going to have one. It's going to be virtual. Well then why is the stage being

321
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,560
built? Well, because Trump has refused to move out. Trump has refused to go. He's told his age,

322
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:08,040
everybody don't start packing the furniture or the clothing or stuff. That's ours. We're not leaving.

323
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:15,480
Well, what do you expect President Trump to do? President Trump shouldn't leave. President Trump

324
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:24,120
shouldn't go. If it's fraud, he should fight on. This is just kind of sad because just imagine

325
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,200
as anti-Bush as Alex pretends to be, just imagine him arguing in support of Al Gore squatting in the

326
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,000
White House because the 2000 election was stolen. Right. Yeah. Earlier in this episode, Alex said

327
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,320
that even if Trump was a horrible bad guy, the election was still stolen from him. So we have a

328
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,680
responsibility to fight to overturn it. I know that he said that the 2000 election was fraudulent,

329
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,880
but somehow I just can't imagine him working up this passion to support Bill Clinton's Vice

330
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,320
President getting into office. Yeah. You know, the pyramids, they closed those off so you

331
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,520
couldn't get out. So I'm fine. If Trump doesn't want to leave, we just board up the White House,

332
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:06,520
build a nice little pyramid around it. And then, you know, he lives in comfort. I say we drop

333
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,000
snakes in every now and again, just to keep things exciting, you know, for the few weeks they have

334
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,080
with air or whatever. Exercise. Yeah, absolutely. Run away from snakes for a little while. Or hunt.

335
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,560
Make sport of it. Just the Trump family running around the White House stabbing

336
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,680
snakes. Yeah. Why not? I love it. Yeah. That'd be great. So Alex talks about like,

337
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:32,200
about like, Hey, you know, I went to this rally, this Jericho March a while back, back in DC.

338
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,840
Sure. And I said that Biden will not be president one way or another. A lot of people thought

339
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,880
maybe rightly that speaking got a little bit. Yeah. I was not. And in fact, I'm a snitch.

340
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,200
Okay. Yeah. All right. Sell me on this one. Alex out to himself as a snitch. Tell me on this.

341
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,200
We elected president Trump in one way or another. Either by overturning the election and showing

342
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:03,000
it's a fraud and, and, and, and getting Congress to act on January 6th to not certify it for Biden.

343
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,600
Or whether we end up impeaching Joe Biden or getting him arrested,

344
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,680
such high comm agent one way or another, he will be removed. And that's what I said in my speech

345
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,280
a few weeks ago in DC that made national headlines, claiming I said, kill Joe Biden.

346
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,920
Really? Why haven't I been arrested? Why? Because that's not what I said.

347
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:29,480
The secret service hasn't called me. The last thing I want is for Joe Biden to get assassinated.

348
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,640
That's how they can turn lemons into lemonade. That's how they can make that guy a victim and

349
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,160
a good guy when he's a bad guy, then we'll have Kamala Harris probably worse.

350
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:46,680
Secret service knows I'm on record, not once, not twice, but three times getting crazy people

351
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:52,360
arrested who were actually stockpiling weapons and planning to kill presidents.

352
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,960
These crazies have sent us letters and called us before and said, I'm going to

353
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,960
kill George W. Bush. I'm going to kill Obama. You know what I do? I picked the phone up and

354
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,400
I call the secret service. I don't believe Alex really, but if he did, if he, if that's true,

355
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,840
good, you should be doing that. But also don't tell your audience.

356
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,800
I would definitely not tell your audience that if we said, Hey, some people said,

357
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,800
we're going to kill the president. We called the FBI and they got taken care of. People would be

358
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,400
like, yeah, good job. It's the appropriate thing to do. It's deeply alienating of extreme right-wing

359
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,720
weirdos. That's a problem. That's a problem for people who are interested in you.

360
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,880
If you speak too freely, I will snitch. That's what Alex said.

361
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:41,960
I am a turncoat. Look, I love the extreme stuff. I love it. I love dancing around it politically.

362
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,640
Now, that said, I will call Janet Reno in a god damn second.

363
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:54,600
This glass eye is, have you heard snitches get stitches? Yeah, this is a glass eye. All right.

364
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,120
Let's, let's just keep that straight. Real, real fool, fool's move on Alex's part.

365
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:07,320
Listen, all of you, I will turn you in. All right. Good work.

366
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:13,080
So, uh, he's real disinterested in, uh, the Nashville, uh, situation, which I found kind

367
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:19,560
of surprising because like I said, he put out a video about it on, on Christmas, which seems

368
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,360
really kind of makes you think that maybe this is, you know, maybe he did smell something really

369
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,960
important. Um, in the air, maybe, yeah, maybe he did pick up on some pattern that he wanted to flash

370
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,760
out. Nah, he just doesn't really care, but still probably a false flag. All right. We're entering

371
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,080
the phase of false flags. It's a lot of questions about what really happened at the bombing

372
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,320
in Nashville. We've got Joel Skousen, world affairs brief, who's got a lot of

373
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,520
excellent analysis joining us on that front. He says nothing.

374
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,960
I was going to say, what the fuck could Skousen know about?

375
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,720
I, if I know Skousen and I do a little, I would say he's going to say it's a false flag.

376
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,640
But I can't say that for sure because he doesn't talk about it when he's on the show.

377
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Why would you? He doesn't know anything about it.

378
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,840
He has bigger things to talk about. Our munitions expert Joel Skousen coming in.

379
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:15,160
Well, you know, I'm sure Joel would have made time to talk about, uh, this possibly being a

380
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,680
false flag, but yet more important things to do, like tell you, you've got to live

381
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,040
an hour outside of town if you want to survive. Absolutely.

382
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,080
Not too far because then it becomes like almost impossible to get supplies.

383
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,520
Exactly. Yeah. But you have to get far away enough from

384
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,320
places where there's large populations and people can't walk to you.

385
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,000
He does go a while down that road. All right.

386
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,640
I do like a good, uh, that sounds like when I was like six and my friends and I were building a

387
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,040
snow fort and we like drew up like, there's going to be parapets here and there's going to be

388
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,320
turrets and we're going to make sure that you, there's going to be murder holes.

389
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,880
We're going to make a tree mache out of ice. Exactly. Yeah. Cool, man. Yeah. No,

390
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,240
it's fun to dream. It's fun to dream. Yeah. Um, also I know exactly where to find Joel

391
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,440
Skousen now. About an hour outside of town. Let's set up a radius.

392
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:17,000
You've got to, we've got a Skousen perimeter. Also, it's not mileage. It's about an hour.

393
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,800
Doesn't matter if you're driving or walking or wherever it is. It's just got to be about an hour.

394
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,360
I think, I think it's by truck. By truck. Yeah. That's the sense I get.

395
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:33,320
Right. Not as the crow flies. No, no. Crows can't get lumber back to your house or.

396
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,720
That's true. Or piping. That's true. That's true.

397
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:42,360
So Nashville, uh, conspiracies appear to have deflated quite a bit. Um, but there's an

398
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,640
escalation going on surrounding COVID-19, uh, related stuff. And I'm getting to the point where

399
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,680
I'm getting the sense that Alex is just saying it's not even real. Like he's dancing dangerously

400
00:24:52,680 --> 00:25:00,040
close to David Ike territory. China's open for business. They're bragging that we'll never be

401
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,520
open that, that, that under, cause we didn't quote handle COVID, right. It's totally made up,

402
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,760
totally hyped. PCR tests are fake. It's all admitted. So he seems to be implying that the

403
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:17,320
tests themselves are all fake as opposed to amplifying and misleading people or what he,

404
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:23,480
but he's so unclear. Yeah. He's so unclear. And he'll say like, I'm not saying the virus is fake,

405
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,760
but all of the, the, the ways he's describing the circumstances would lead you to that conclusion.

406
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:35,640
Sure. I would, I would just say like, my guess is he's just reactionary contrarian for the sake of

407
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,680
it at this. Like if you say any of that, like, Oh, it's, it's 100% real. You'd be like, no, it's

408
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:47,400
fake. No, I mean, the virus doesn't cause the test. No, I mean, the virus is real, but the tests are

409
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,640
fake. Like there's no matter what something is fake enough for him to disregard the entirety

410
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,120
of the thing. I think there's also a feeling of like, he's just desperate to be interesting.

411
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,560
And so like, if you come in with a piece of information, he'll blow your mind with sort of

412
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:08,680
the contradictory piece of it. Yeah. That's fair. So one thing also that he's contrary to is Trump.

413
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:16,840
Sure. Kidding. Nice. But he's not very happy about those pardons. Oh, the ones where he

414
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:23,000
pardoned war criminals and murderers and white supremacists and primers. It's hard to say what

415
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,200
Alex doesn't approve of. The number one issue is not Trump's stupid pardons, which I disagree with

416
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,640
these latest ones. It's terrible. The number one issues, world government, new world order

417
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,240
technocracy, passports to travel, to leave your house, digital IDs, total control. It's not coming.

418
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,800
It's here. So I want to know what you think the number one issue is and what we should do about

419
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:52,840
it. So Alex has plenty of time to cover this story with responsibility. Like why don't you agree with

420
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:59,000
those pardons? Which ones? Yeah. What's your problem? Right. And why do you think Trump

421
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,840
pardoned those people anyway? Yeah. And so I was going through the pardon lists from the 22nd and

422
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,880
the 23rd. Cause I was trying to figure out like, you know, what's the issue here. Yeah. And you

423
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,160
know, you had like Roger Stone and Paul Manafort were probably like the headliners of those shows.

424
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,080
And it's like, Alex can't be mad about that. No. That's like, he's for that. Yeah. So then it was

425
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:27,000
like Charles Kushner, Jared Kushner's dad. Like maybe Alex is kind of wishy-washy on Jared. He

426
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
thinks he's a globalist, but I've also heard Alex say that Charles Kushner was set up. Yeah. You

427
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,560
know, he was just trying to prove that this person was cheating or whatever. Yeah. That was a good

428
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,600
sell. Whatever the fuck. Almost got me on that one. Yeah. So I've seen him, you know, go both

429
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:51,560
ways with that. So then of course, what you were referring to is the four dudes who were Blackwater

430
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:57,160
mercenaries. Yeah. The serial killers. Who carried out the Nisour Square massacre. Yeah. Which is

431
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:02,280
really fucked up considering that last year Trump pardoned, what was that guy? Eddie Gallagher? The

432
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:09,560
dude who killed civilians. Yep. It's a bad, it's a bad pattern. No. I think I got a feeling that

433
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:16,280
that's what Alex is talking about. Right. Because like so much of his career and any kind of like,

434
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,720
you know, like, well, you got to give it to Alex is built on his opposition to the Iraq war. Yeah.

435
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:28,120
So much of it is based on like, I am not a war hawk. I have principles. I'm not going to just

436
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,240
go along with George W. Bush and this war that's built on a lie, you know, that kind of stuff

437
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,880
is the only reason that his career had any legs to begin with. Yeah. Otherwise he would just be,

438
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,760
I don't know, a hyper talented anti-communist weirdo no one's heard of. Yeah. Like that's

439
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,840
what prompted people of other political alignments to consider him. Yeah. Like as being like,

440
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,960
Hey, this guy's onto something. Yeah. If you go hard enough on, uh, everybody's enemy,

441
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,600
some people will even from the opposite side be like, yeah, you're going real hard, man.

442
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:06,280
I'm all about that. I had some friends in college who almost got sucked into LaRouche. Yeah. Yeah.

443
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,760
Cause these guys all suck so bad. Yeah. And so I kind of thought about that as like,

444
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,520
well, that would be such an invalidation of like really a core piece of Alex's like premise. Yeah.

445
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:22,440
But it's like, we've heard him talk about wanting martial law and like putting the socialists and

446
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,320
Antifa in camps and stuff. It's like, that's an, that's an invalidation. He could, you could do

447
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,800
that if you wanted to. So I, here's my theory. What's your theory? I don't think it's actually

448
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:39,320
those parties. Okay. I was looking through the list of pardons and I found that two pardons

449
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,400
went to John Tate and Jesse Benton, the two Ron Paul campaign members who tried to bribe an Iowa

450
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:51,560
state rep to switch his endorsement from Bachman to Ron Paul back in 2012. Yeah. You might think

451
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,320
that Alex would support both of those pardons because he's excusing the crimes of people who

452
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,240
are on the same side as Alex, but you'd be wrong. Alex hates Jesse Benton. He's indicated in the

453
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,840
past that he feels like Benton has worked to keep him on the outside of things and that Benton

454
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,840
weaseled his way into the Patriot movement by marrying Ron Paul's granddaughter. I do remember

455
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,080
that. He went on a whole, he's done episodes about it. He's done a lot about that. That is

456
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:24,840
really funny. And fucking hated that guy. He is a scourge on the Paul family. I think it might be

457
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,760
that. That has to be it. That's hilarious. You know, you got to go with the psychology of the

458
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:35,080
individual and there is nothing that motivates Alex more than petty grievance. Petty spite is

459
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,280
number one on the things. Look, you could have murdered his family, but if Stelter walks by,

460
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,360
it's Stelter who's going to get the hate. Philosophical consistency is what you would

461
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,000
hope for. So you would hope it would be something like, you know, these people are out and at war

462
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,200
criminals and pardoning them may in fact actually be a violation of the Geneva Convention. No,

463
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,560
I believe it is. Yeah. Yeah. Experts in the field have indicated that it is. No, I mean,

464
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:06,360
it is fucked up because more, I think, than any other decision that a president can make,

465
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,480
pardons are intimate. Do you know what I mean? Like that, you pardoned somebody knowing full

466
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:19,240
well that they were convicted of their crimes and chances are, did them. And pardoning those guys

467
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:25,320
is very much like, brown people are not people to me. That's what that says. I am pardoning

468
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:32,280
those people. The most generous interpretation is civilians in other countries are at the mercy of

469
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:38,520
our military. The most generous. I would argue that it points more towards I'm fine with genocide,

470
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:46,280
but yeah. I mean, that's the reality of it. So if you see Trump pardon those guys and you're

471
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,880
fine with that, you're fine with everything. That's what it is. The message of it is harrowing.

472
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,520
Yeah, it's terrifying. I mean, there's a lot of decisions that are made by elected officials

473
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:04,440
that send like less than ideal messages. That's definitely true. But something like that does

474
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,840
give a real middle finger to the idea that anyone in the rest of the world would treat us

475
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:18,600
like we're operating from any kind of place of good faith. Any movie where they're like,

476
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:25,080
oh, okay, we're going to go in, we've got this super murderer in the darkest dungeon and we're

477
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:30,920
going to use him now. No, those are the bad guys. The guys who are like, yeah, let's set the dog

478
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:36,840
loose. That's what this pardon is, is let's set the dogs loose on our enemies when it's fucked up.

479
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,240
Not even our enemies, just people. Except in that one season of Heroes,

480
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,560
where it's the guys on level five. That's true.

481
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,760
Some of them were really bad, but I think a couple of them were actually got,

482
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,760
they were just down there because their powers were too strong.

483
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,920
Too strong. I don't remember exactly. They're weapons of mass destruction.

484
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,960
I kind of lost interest in that. Don't worry about it. No one's hurting you.

485
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,480
So Heroes is actually a work of science fiction. You might be surprised to learn

486
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,960
that Alex took in a little piece of science fiction over the weekend.

487
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,240
I am not surprised.

488
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:13,640
So I want to go to Manuel, Diana, Brent, Seth, Kirk, Joe, Wendy, and others.

489
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,000
Diana. Oh no.

490
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,120
It's funny we got a lady named Diana calling in.

491
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,160
Get the fuck out of here.

492
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,960
Marvel comics, I don't like these modern movies. They're all full of propaganda and very,

493
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,800
very boring and have really stupid plots.

494
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,280
Yeah. Agreed.

495
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,200
And a lot of men are kind of arrested development and spend their lives obsessing with it.

496
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,600
But I got taken by some friends last night to see the new Wonder Woman movie.

497
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,920
And I've seen the other two, been basically forced to watch those as well.

498
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,680
They were unwatchable. This one was next level.

499
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,560
You just went for a movie.

500
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,080
It was like a hallucination.

501
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,160
Why do you keep getting dragged to movies?

502
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,760
Like half of his media diet he's being forced to watch.

503
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,400
Just say that you like stuff.

504
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:57,800
Yeah.

505
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,680
Why can't you?

506
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,600
Oh no, I'm not really that big a fan of Star Wars.

507
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,160
No, no, no.

508
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,520
I don't really do sports.

509
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,160
No, no, no.

510
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,920
I don't really do comic book movies.

511
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,400
Fuck off.

512
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,200
Say you like it.

513
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,600
Yeah, yeah.

514
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,400
You wanted to see Wonder Woman because you like comic book movies.

515
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:09,560
Yeah.

516
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,920
I got dragged to it opening weekend.

517
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,280
Why? Why did you get dragged to it?

518
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:23,960
I got dragged to a movie theater on opening weekend to see Wonder Woman 1984 during COVID.

519
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,160
Yeah, yeah.

520
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,920
By some of my friends who just dragged me there.

521
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,160
Yeah.

522
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,120
I got trussed up.

523
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,760
Bizarre.

524
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,280
I was gagged.

525
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,600
Yeah.

526
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,840
I was dragged from my truck.

527
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,400
Although I will say that not liking it is

528
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,440
probably the most obvious review you could imagine from Alex.

529
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

530
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,080
It's female superhero.

531
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,960
Yeah, done.

532
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,320
Yeah, get the fuck out of here.

533
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,840
Strangely loved the new Ghostbusters.

534
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,560
Sure, sure.

535
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,040
He did not.

536
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:57,240
So anyway, it's basically like if you go see Wonder Woman, you're getting mind controlled.

537
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,480
Okay.

538
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,920
This one was next level propaganda.

539
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,200
It was like a hallucination, flicker rates, everything.

540
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:10,280
This is the future of mind control and a very positive message on the surface, a very negative

541
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,960
one deeper into it.

542
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,360
But it was very well done.

543
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,560
What you wish for?

544
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,200
Very cheesy at one level, very sophisticated at another.

545
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,080
I mean, this is Stanley Kubrick level 2.0.

546
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,040
So you liked it.

547
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,680
Very, very sophisticated.

548
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,120
So when you go see that movie, you are basically being mind controlled.

549
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,520
Okay.

550
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,480
I just say you didn't like the movie.

551
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,480
I'm going to tell you this right now.

552
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:35,800
Yeah.

553
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,560
I saw about 80% of that movie.

554
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,360
Uh huh.

555
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,560
Fell asleep on the last part.

556
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,760
But probably mind control.

557
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,560
No, that was fine.

558
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,280
No, it was fine.

559
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,920
I was happy.

560
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,080
The controllers just wanted you to fall asleep.

561
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,200
Yeah, it was good stuff.

562
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,560
Two things.

563
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,480
Your subconscious brain took in the rest of it.

564
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,800
And now I don't feel safe around you.

565
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,080
Not sophisticated at all.

566
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,480
Okay.

567
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,360
Not even a little bit.

568
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,640
Kind of a comic book movie?

569
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,400
Two, Pedro Pascal is the greatest actor in the history of the world.

570
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,280
Oh, it's amazing.

571
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,760
Yeah.

572
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,720
So good.

573
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,000
He was the best part of it.

574
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,800
Once his part was done, that's when I fell asleep.

575
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,080
I was like, ah, fuck this.

576
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,400
I think a lot of people feel the same way about Game of Thrones.

577
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:11,960
Yeah.

578
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,840
There we go.

579
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,960
All right.

580
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,760
Watch out.

581
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,880
Yeah.

582
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,040
Maybe it's a sign of getting older.

583
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,080
Maybe I'm maturing.

584
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,320
Yeah.

585
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,560
I don't find Alex's movie reviews as good anymore.

586
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:27,960
No.

587
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,600
When he did the Watchmen, it was hilarious.

588
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,320
Yeah.

589
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:31,800
Yeah.

590
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,560
This is kind of just a slow pitch.

591
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:42,120
We're both too old to really get into a bad movie criticism of Wonder Woman.

592
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,720
Maybe.

593
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,560
I could stand someone telling me what's wrong with the plot,

594
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,840
like if there's a structural issue with the story or something.

595
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,360
It doesn't make sense, but that's fine.

596
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,240
Yeah.

597
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,920
I think you could probably still enjoy it.

598
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,920
I mean, there's incredibly huge problems with most of the Fast and Furious movies.

599
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,880
I can't think of any.

600
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,600
They're still amazing.

601
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,120
Internal logic is fine.

602
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,620
Yeah.

603
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,120
Yeah.

604
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,480
I'm too old.

605
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,720
Alex is 10 years older than me, and I'm too old to listen to his dumb ass

606
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,440
tell me about how this is sophisticated mind control.

607
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,320
I think it was interesting.

608
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,160
Oh, the men are cowards.

609
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,640
I think it was interesting the first time we watched it,

610
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:22,760
because the juxtaposition of a gruff, ostensible newsman just being like,

611
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,560
and Watchmen's stupid is very funny.

612
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,720
And now we're on movie 300 of him being a child, and you're like, all right.

613
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,720
But Watchmen 2, there was depth to his review.

614
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,600
That's true.

615
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
And he kept mispronouncing Ozymandias.

616
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,080
That's true.

617
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,440
Ozymandamus is pretty great.

618
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,680
But there was something to that.

619
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,760
He was swinging.

620
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,040
He was swinging for the fences.

621
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,520
That's true.

622
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,480
And this is just kind of like, I kind of just get the sense that he was overwhelmed

623
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,600
by the visuals and stuff and didn't understand the movie.

624
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,360
And so he decided to call it brainwashing.

625
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:54,860
Okay.

626
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,240
This is beyond suspended disbelief.

627
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,080
This is beyond lowering your brain waves to a near sleep state.

628
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,280
This is beyond daydreaming.

629
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,520
This was full on hallucination.

630
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,480
And I was conscious of it second to second.

631
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,600
But still, my brain was, you need to stop watching this.

632
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,760
This is not good.

633
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,640
So it was next level.

634
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,080
Absolutely next level.

635
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,840
I think he was just sitting there like, I don't know.

636
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,880
I don't know what's going on.

637
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,140
Yeah.

638
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,920
I mean, you know, maybe take some brain force and it'll allow you to focus on the movie.

639
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,560
That might help.

640
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,060
Yeah.

641
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,560
So he analyzes the film a little bit.

642
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,160
And by the way, I'd like to point out that he's spending as much time on Wonder Woman

643
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,200
for no fucking reason.

644
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:36,600
No, no.

645
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,560
Diana called.

646
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,720
He, well, there is that, but he could have explained what his problem is with Trump's

647
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,040
pardons in this time that he's wasting on trivial nonsense.

648
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,280
Yeah.

649
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,880
But he heard the name Diana.

650
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,880
So you got to talk about Wonder Woman 84.

651
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,200
Right.

652
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,520
Or, I don't know, any other thing that has Diana in the name.

653
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah.

654
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,120
Princess Diana.

655
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,800
Gotta talk about that.

656
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,760
Couldn't come up with another.

657
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:06,680
The whole theme is there's an end of world event coming and we're the ones making it

658
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,400
happen because we want too much because of our desires.

659
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,240
We've got to give our will over to something else to stop it.

660
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,440
Then it tricks you.

661
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,760
Your will has been given over to this antichrist character, but then you've got to denounce

662
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,600
him, but give your will to another collective that is the goddess Diana.

663
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,200
But you've still given your will over and it is, and men are bad.

664
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,560
Women are going to lead us out of this.

665
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,880
And that's what the Carnegie Endowment was set up to do was in the human species as we

666
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,760
know it, not just going to end men, they're going to end women as well and make us corporate

667
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,760
creations that are patented and controlled in the globalist, our God.

668
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,480
Two stars.

669
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,880
So I was listening to that and I was like, okay, I've not seen this movie and I'm not

670
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,200
going to see this movie probably just because, and not because I don't want to or anything.

671
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,720
I just don't see movies that often.

672
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,920
No, no, you'll be fine.

673
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:13,720
It looks good like any hero movie is, but I was guessing that there's some sort of a

674
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:20,840
villain that tricks people into supporting them and then Wonder Woman gets their support

675
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,000
and that is how she's able to be successful.

676
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,500
Kinda.

677
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,240
But it's close enough.

678
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,240
That's what he's talking about more or less, right?

679
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,840
Yeah, but the problem is...

680
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,440
Like, give your will to someone and support them.

681
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,200
Just, no spoilers because I didn't finish the movie.

682
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,960
No spoilers because I can't.

683
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,320
Because I can't spoil it.

684
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:48,440
But the main bad guy is Pedro Pascal, Nicolas caging all over the scenery and he can grant

685
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,160
wishes, but it's a monkey's paw scenario.

686
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,280
It's a classic, what do you want?

687
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,480
And there's a price for it.

688
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,120
Oh, okay, so he's a Twilight Zone episode.

689
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,520
Exactly, yes, the entire movie is Nicolas Cage Twilight Zoning everyone.

690
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,200
My review of the movie is very simple.

691
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,920
At the beginning, it's butt.

692
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,560
And then in the middle, you're like, oh, this is pretty interesting.

693
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,600
And then it's butt again.

694
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,040
Like, that's the whole movie.

695
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,840
What do you mean butt?

696
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,960
I mean butt.

697
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,840
Like a buttocks?

698
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,880
It's bad.

699
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,120
Oh.

700
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,760
Yeah.

701
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,040
There's nothing wrong with buttockses.

702
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,920
No, there's...

703
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,640
Okay, fine.

704
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,080
I don't understand that being a...

705
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,360
All right, fair enough.

706
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,760
I feel like there's another way you could have expressed that.

707
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,280
Asshead.

708
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,240
No?

709
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:29,800
I don't know.

710
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,280
All right.

711
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,080
Anyway, don't watch Wonder Woman on LSD, bro.

712
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,440
So again, lots of cheesiness, lots of kid stuff, lots of mindlessness, lots of 80s

713
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,040
nostalgia, but that's just for your conscious brain.

714
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,520
Behind it, all the other manipulations taking place.

715
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:57,320
So I'll do a more in-depth review later, but it was definitely mind control caliber material.

716
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,800
I definitely would not take it on LSD.

717
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:06,040
Yeah, I think that most bright, flashy things might be a little bit tough to take.

718
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,240
Watch while you're on LSD when you're 46 years old.

719
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,840
Probably with a history of amphetamine abuse.

720
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,880
And a loose grasp on reality.

721
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,560
Yeah, to begin with, yeah.

722
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,360
From the jump.

723
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:20,600
Yeah.

724
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,280
I don't think so.

725
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,960
I don't think that's a smart move on his part.

726
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,520
No!

727
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:26,680
No.

728
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,320
So Alex does not really...

729
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,000
I don't think he gets back into a more in-depth Wonder Woman review, which actually...

730
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,160
I'm equal parts disappointed and glad he didn't.

731
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:44,040
I could have used something a little bit deeper than this, but at the same time, I don't care.

732
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,000
Yeah.

733
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,440
He'll do it eventually.

734
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,560
The way he describes Wonder Woman makes me want to watch they live with him, just to see if like...

735
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,080
Does he even see the hidden messages, like the consumed messages?

736
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,840
Does he just see like a blank sheet?

737
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,200
And he's like, well, I don't get why these people hate these aliens, so they're great.

738
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,040
Capitalists are running everything.

739
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,840
All these people, what are you even looking at blank signs for?

740
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,240
Come on.

741
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,720
We can talk about this the next time it comes up.

742
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,440
Yeah.

743
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,000
Or maybe...

744
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,920
No, I already did this with Marty.

745
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,320
Uh-oh.

746
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,040
The episode where Rowdy Roddy Piper was on Info Wars.

747
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,920
Oh, that's right!

748
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,360
And he talked about they live, yeah.

749
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,400
Don't think Alex gets a whole lot of...

750
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:19,900
Yeah.

751
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,600
So in this next clip, Alex says something that is completely...

752
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,000
I just don't understand it.

753
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,080
The first part of it, categorically not true.

754
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,240
The second part, impossible.

755
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:33,960
Okay.

756
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,160
You know, you're an American.

757
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,040
You've been brought up that America's bad, America's terrible,

758
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,360
it's the worst place on earth, we're the most oppressive people anywhere,

759
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,280
and statistically it's actually the opposite.

760
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,920
But we're never taught about the evils and corruption

761
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,480
that goes on in other places where tyranny is in charge.

762
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,680
But when you look at historical tyranny through the last few thousand years,

763
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,640
and then current tyrannies, and tyrannies the last hundred years,

764
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,880
every form of tyranny, every form of abuse,

765
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,840
every form of oppression and really nasty stuff,

766
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,360
and the worst people being in charge is in the UN,

767
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,000
is in the world government, is in the corporate governance,

768
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,760
is in the communist Chinese.

769
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,560
That makes no sense, that part at the end there.

770
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,060
Yeah.

771
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,720
The last thousand years.

772
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,280
I mean, I guess you could go with China.

773
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:20,760
Sure.

774
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,160
Perhaps.

775
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,440
But the UN, leading that sentence is tough.

776
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,600
The way you make that sentence work is you just pretend

777
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,920
that the world government is everything you don't like.

778
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,720
Yeah, yeah.

779
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,720
And that the UN is actually also the, you know, the League of Nations,

780
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,400
and it's also every government that has ever existed throughout Europe,

781
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,840
and you know, whatever.

782
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,560
I think it's really...

783
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,720
Just define your own terms,

784
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,440
and then you can say all corruption has been part of this.

785
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,200
I think it's really funny that he absolutely cannot bring up

786
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,400
a very obvious one in Russia with just being like,

787
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,960
well, Putin has declared himself president for life,

788
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,920
and any crimes that he commits are retroactively impossible to charge him for.

789
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:04,200
He just attempted to kill the only person running against him for leadership.

790
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:10,520
Yep. That sounds a lot like stuff Alex wants Trump to do.

791
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,520
Like one-to-one.

792
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,800
And I think that the problem is that in America,

793
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,240
we're never taught about other places doing bad things.

794
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:21,720
Never!

795
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,920
We never hear about it.

796
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,420
Never.

797
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:24,760
Uh-uh.

798
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,720
Not something...

799
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,600
We definitely don't hear about bad things happening in other countries

800
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,080
very differently than when they happen here, too.

801
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,360
It would be wild if we were to cover different stories,

802
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,720
you know, the same story differently.

803
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,600
That'd just be crazy.

804
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,320
We never have people on the radio talking about how the Civil War was about to take place.

805
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,120
No, never!

806
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:42,620
No, no, no.

807
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,160
So that was weird.

808
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,520
I got very confused by that.

809
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,240
And then I got kind of mad.

810
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,520
So pretty amazing information.

811
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,840
And when John Hopkins put that report out,

812
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,560
they had Snopes and everybody go,

813
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,400
oh, it's false. So they go, well, all the year's numbers aren't in.

814
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,840
But in the study, they looked at that.

815
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,000
They looked at last year, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands more

816
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,440
already than it would be this year.

817
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,440
So they averaged in the rest of the year and found still about the same deaths.

818
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,920
But they said, well, it's not totally scientific.

819
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,040
Down to the person.

820
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,400
Well, nothing is with statistics.

821
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:28,280
So that's how they spin the fact into something that they can then obfuscate.

822
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,960
This is really simple.

823
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:36,120
According to the CDC, there were 2,839,205 deaths total in 2019,

824
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,760
a rate of about 867 per 100,000 population.

825
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,320
We don't have the total data for 2020 yet,

826
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,880
and reliable figures won't be available for months.

827
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,680
But the AP reported that scholars estimate the number will be over 3.2 million.

828
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,280
Typically, you would expect a consistent rate of death

829
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,280
to produce between 20,000 and 50,000 extra deaths each year

830
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,360
as the population ages and also increases in just a total number.

831
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,400
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

832
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,800
There's just a reality that people are dying,

833
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,280
and Alex's political position depends on him living in complete denial of that fact.

834
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,920
And I don't mean to be too preachy, but I hope this haunts him for the rest of his life,

835
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,240
how ghastly this kind of behavior is.

836
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:21,720
People are suffering and losing loved ones for him just to pull this kind of bullshit.

837
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,720
It's just, I want more Wonder Woman reviews.

838
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,000
I don't want this shit.

839
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,400
This is what I was telling you before the episode.

840
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,280
I was like, yeah, I got one of those moments I haven't had in a while

841
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,040
where I just had to walk away from the computer.

842
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,320
I had to stand up and be like, no, no, no.

843
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,000
You know, my family is what they are,

844
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,760
but my little sister and her husband both tested positive not too long ago.

845
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:51,080
And I just, like the possibilities for damage to them,

846
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:55,800
that we aren't even considering, like, fine, I get it.

847
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,400
You don't think that you're going to die.

848
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:58,680
That's great.

849
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,880
Like, have you not seen long COVID symptoms?

850
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,160
Have you not seen people's psychosis manifest?

851
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,080
Like, how do you not understand how terrifyingly dangerous this shit is?

852
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,640
And it happened to people in my family.

853
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,800
You know, like, there's no escape from it.

854
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,360
And it's because of fucking monsters like this.

855
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,280
Oh, it's because of at least behaviors like this.

856
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,560
Yes, totally.

857
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,080
So fucking, yeah.

858
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,360
The unknown unknowns, I think is partially what you're talking about too.

859
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,280
And it's just like, I don't know.

860
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,720
I hope that he lives long enough to be haunted by this.

861
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,280
Yeah, please.

862
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,000
So Alex does finally get to taking calls.

863
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,560
I'm not sure if he ever gets around to Diana.

864
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,520
I regret to inform you that I think he takes two calls on this episode.

865
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,480
Hilarious.

866
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:45,400
But one guy calls in, he wants to talk about how diverse Trump rallies are.

867
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:52,920
I feel like the fake news media and fellow MPC Americans, they're expecting a specific

868
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,600
archetype of Trump supporters to be there in DC.

869
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:03,720
But I feel like they'll be greatly shocked at the intellectual diversity that will come

870
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,360
crashing through in DC on January 6th.

871
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,640
Well, they are shocked.

872
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,400
I mean, they tried to always say the Tea Party was racist so that blacks, Hispanics and Asians

873
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,280
wouldn't go.

874
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,960
That started to fail about eight years ago as people went and were totally accepted and

875
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,760
loved.

876
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,400
And then now under Trump, you go and you'll have an over-representation at some of these

877
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,240
rallies of blacks, Hispanics and others.

878
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:28,280
And the media, that's what put them into total race-based panic mode to say Trump is Hitler

879
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,240
because they don't know what to do.

880
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,480
I mean, look, Trump got three times more black men to vote for him than any Republican ever.

881
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,280
That scares the living snot out of the establishment.

882
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,080
Oh yeah, of course it does.

883
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,880
So this caller brought up intellectual diversity.

884
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,120
Yeah.

885
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,560
And Alex immediately starts talking about racial...

886
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,280
Right.

887
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,760
Well, they don't actually have any intellectual diversity.

888
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,880
I don't know what he was trying to say.

889
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:57,560
I think that people have the image of Trump fans from past Trump rallies.

890
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,360
I think that that...

891
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,960
The ones where we saw them.

892
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,880
History is prelude, as they say.

893
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,600
You expect about that.

894
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:11,800
Sometimes I really do think that the GOP thinks maybe there are 10 black people total, and

895
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,360
then when one shows up at the rally, they're like, we got 10% of the entire...

896
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,440
How do you not think these things are diverse?

897
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,520
We got 10% of all black people here.

898
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:27,240
Well, what I think is interesting is the inability for Alex to hear diversity and not immediately

899
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:36,040
jump into defense mode about the clear lack of diversity at these rallies.

900
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:40,840
From that standpoint, intellectual diversity, I guess, means that some people want to shoot

901
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,560
people and some people want to go the legislative route.

902
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

903
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,080
I guess maybe that's...

904
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,880
A lot of diversity there.

905
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:53,400
Some people are Mies Institute libertarian types, and some people are outright fascists.

906
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,680
So you've got a lot of people on different sides.

907
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:02,680
Also, not for nothing, Trump got 8% of the black vote in the last election, so it's definitely

908
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:07,480
better to report that as, oh, record black support, instead of just saying, hey, this

909
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,040
party that I support has never gotten over 10%.

910
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,560
Has so alienated an entire group of people.

911
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:20,600
Much like Trump's pardons, let's not consider any of the surrounding context of that.

912
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,600
But man, Alex has a great idea.

913
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,160
What's that?

914
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:33,560
If his goal is to incite violence and an insurrection among right-wing people in this country, he

915
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,000
has an amazing idea.

916
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,320
Thank God he hasn't conceded.

917
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:41,640
We need to keep exposing the fraud, keep showing the evidence, and then no matter what happens,

918
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,520
Trump is still our president, and I think he should have that talking point, because

919
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:53,320
it's true that the power structure in the system has occupied America and put in their

920
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:59,800
puppet and that Trump should then travel around the country rallying legislatures, state houses,

921
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:04,200
and others, and he should have a nightly TV program where he, it'll have more ratings

922
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,040
than Fox, talks to the public.

923
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,480
Yeah, he should have a nightly show where he pretends to be the second president and

924
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,040
the rightful president of the United States because there's an occupier in the house.

925
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:21,080
I don't know if I want to live in a 2020 where we're reliving like the pope and the dark

926
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,120
pope fighting in Italy in the 17th century.

927
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,360
I don't want to live where that is.

928
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,120
I don't get why we're still doing that.

929
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,280
It wasn't good for people.

930
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,040
No, it was bad.

931
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,520
But yeah, when I was listening to this, I was like, okay, it's a stupid idea.

932
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,560
Trump's never going to do that.

933
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,200
The TV show, maybe, if it profits him somehow, yes.

934
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:49,000
He's not going to go on a barnstorming tour of state legislatures in order to save the

935
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:49,880
Constitution.

936
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,040
I mean, essentially you would be describing a war.

937
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,760
But he's also going to go from town to town recruiting for his fucking army.

938
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:03,080
Well, I mean, he's one of the greatest orators of our generation.

939
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:09,480
He'll go and give really measured, thoughtful speeches about the responsibilities of

940
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,280
statementship.

941
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:10,840
Oh man.

942
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:16,040
I just found that this kind of, this section of the show just really struck me as like

943
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,760
what I would describe as terrorist edging.

944
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,880
Yeah, yeah.

945
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,400
It's just trying to get these people right up to the point of...

946
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,520
But that's what this is.

947
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,200
This whole, like, since he lost the election, it has been nothing but edging.

948
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,640
Like, we're going to do it this time.

949
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,720
No, no, we're not going to blow it up this time.

950
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,680
But next time I do it...

951
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,120
But it feels pretty, like, really pronounced on this 28th.

952
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,280
We don't value ourselves.

953
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:38,840
So guess what?

954
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,360
The new world order doesn't value us.

955
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,520
And God will let us have what we want.

956
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,480
We forsake ourselves.

957
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,520
God didn't forsake us.

958
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:55,320
We took all the blessings and threw them out the window because we had a game of tennis

959
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,680
to play or golf to player.

960
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,400
We were going to go act cool with our friends and get drunk again.

961
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,280
And so we'll care.

962
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,400
Let somebody else handle it.

963
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,120
Okay.

964
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,800
Everything will be taken from you now.

965
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,440
Everything.

966
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,120
And they're going to do it in increments where you join along, you'll be taken care of.

967
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,760
And then, oh, it gets a little harder, but you still join.

968
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,040
You still keep complying while you're being strangled.

969
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,000
All right.

970
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,240
Let's go to Mike in Arizona.

971
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:19,960
Mike, you're on the air.

972
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,520
Go ahead.

973
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,040
Weird sound there.

974
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:22,520
Yeah.

975
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,040
There's a little burp, a little something stuck in his throat.

976
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:26,920
Some reflux.

977
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,160
Maybe had some nachos out at the Alamo Drafthouse.

978
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,600
Hey, everybody's got to get something to eat during WW84.

979
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,720
Yeah, I just hear that stuff.

980
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:42,200
And it's just like, hey, you could keep, you know, getting along, going along to get along.

981
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,360
But that's how you're going to end up in submission.

982
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,440
You're going to end up in shackles unless you blow something up.

983
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,080
Yeah.

984
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,680
It kind of feels that way a little bit.

985
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,640
Yeah, it does.

986
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:56,440
I think that there's something to it, too, where Alex is saying, like, we brought this

987
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,640
on ourselves.

988
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,000
It's your own fault.

989
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:04,840
And that's to, you know, be the guilt fuel that you kind of need to get yourself into

990
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,600
a position where maybe you do something stupid.

991
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,100
Totally.

992
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,120
So one of the things that I think is really weird, and I think we've talked about this

993
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,240
a bit, is that Alex believes that masks are evil.

994
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:15,560
Sure.

995
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,600
And wearing them is a mouth diaper and what have you.

996
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,160
But he sells them.

997
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,040
Well, yeah, of course.

998
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,640
So he rationalizes that here a little bit.

999
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,140
Let's do it.

1000
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,320
I'm not talking about any particular individual.

1001
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:33,640
I'm talking about the way a Pharisee brain works is very one dimensional.

1002
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,640
Like you say the mask are a fraud and cause bacterial pneumonia.

1003
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,840
You say they don't protect you.

1004
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,440
You say they're a symbol of slavery.

1005
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,040
Then what are you doing selling mask?

1006
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:50,120
Well, when we launched them, I made the decision to print it with info wars com.

1007
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:54,760
So if you're on a plane or in a restaurant where it's a private place and they're making

1008
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:00,600
you do it and you need to go there for whatever reason, you wear it to fight back and then

1009
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,840
use the abuse like a judo move.

1010
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,880
They attack you.

1011
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,120
You use their momentum to throw them through the wall.

1012
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,400
No, no, we get it.

1013
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:13,160
That's that we don't we don't no one misunderstands that we understand that he's selling these

1014
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:17,480
masks in an attempt to encourage his audience to be oppositional, defiant to people in public

1015
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,880
and hopefully cause a scene big enough to go viral and get some free press for info wars.

1016
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,600
We understand that the meaning is clear.

1017
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,560
The thing that I think is fascinating, though, is that Alex can't grasp the critique that's

1018
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,840
coming from the other side, namely our critique.

1019
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:38,200
I would say that it's strange that, you know, you think that this is a sign of slavery,

1020
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:44,280
but that somehow this sign of slavery is OK if it's a branded sign of slavery that Alex

1021
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:49,720
can profit off of somehow, whether by selling it or the free press that comes from it or

1022
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:54,200
the potential new audience that gets exposed to your product by other people wearing it.

1023
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,560
It's it's it's weird.

1024
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:00,760
It's it's strange that a sign of slavery would somehow become acceptable if you benefit from

1025
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,920
hey, it's a sign of slavery.

1026
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,520
But, you know, if we're going to have slavery, might as well make a little cash on it.

1027
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,480
That's fucked up.

1028
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,360
Yeah, it's really fucked up because that's pretty much what he said.

1029
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:10,760
Yeah.

1030
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,080
Also, he can straight fuck himself.

1031
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,320
If Alex spent even a minute looking into the history of how enslaved people were branded

1032
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,960
and mutilated to signify that they were enslaved, probably feel pretty bad and maybe a little

1033
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,080
bit petty, complaining about having to wear a mask to go to Kroger.

1034
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,760
You would think you're a fucking dick.

1035
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:35,960
Yep, but he did brave the slavery of public spaces or something because he needed to see

1036
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,680
Wonder Woman.

1037
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,360
And then I talked to everybody I saw in the movie theater.

1038
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,000
It was amazing.

1039
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,960
Alamo Drafthouse, horrible socialist globalist on it.

1040
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,520
They love it.

1041
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,280
You go in, all the lights are turned off.

1042
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,400
It's like dystopic.

1043
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,160
They're sitting there with wanting to, you know, with a thermometer, a laser thermometer

1044
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,640
to, you know, to all get into theater.

1045
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,680
And I said to the guy, I said, you know, the same amount of people who've died this year

1046
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,560
that died last year, right?

1047
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,080
This is all a fraud.

1048
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,160
He goes, I know, but we're just doing to keep you safe.

1049
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,080
Oh, if I never existed, I'd be safe.

1050
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,840
It's all a fraud to shut down the economy.

1051
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,440
You won't even have your job soon, buddy.

1052
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,360
This is a global takeover.

1053
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,080
And the people that own Alamo are horrible leftists.

1054
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,360
Sir, just go see the movie.

1055
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,000
You can even imagine.

1056
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,800
Sir, do you want butter on your popcorn?

1057
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,440
The last 11 months and it was just a disgrace.

1058
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,000
We'll be right back.

1059
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,400
Stay with us.

1060
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,360
Watch it at home.

1061
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,720
You sound miserable.

1062
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,360
I don't get it.

1063
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:38,680
Why would you go to this theater that's run by terrible socialist globalists as opposed

1064
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,280
to just renting it at home?

1065
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:44,920
How can you even, how can you go give money to terrible socialist globalists?

1066
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,400
It seems like it's counter to everything Alex stands for.

1067
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,280
Yeah, totally.

1068
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,920
It seems like he's probably rich enough that he has a pretty comfortable TV in his living

1069
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,920
room, I would assume, based on how many goddamn movies he talks about watching.

1070
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,840
You'd think he's got a pretty cushy setup.

1071
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,240
Maybe even an in-home theater set up.

1072
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,200
Watch this movie around loved ones.

1073
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,240
Oh wait, can't.

1074
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,200
He risks brainwashing his children.

1075
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,080
That's true.

1076
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:15,080
His children may not be strong enough to resist the wiles of the subliminal messages that

1077
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,280
are in Wonder Woman 84.

1078
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,080
Wonder Woman did get an R rating for its subliminal messaging.

1079
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:19,480
Yeah.

1080
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:19,960
Yeah.

1081
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,520
No kidding.

1082
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,440
18 and older without an adult.

1083
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,080
Yeah.

1084
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,200
M-P-A-A-S for subliminal.

1085
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,160
Yes, exactly.

1086
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,080
Yeah, dumb.

1087
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,200
This is dumb.

1088
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,480
I mean, I'm not gonna judge.

1089
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,160
I'm not gonna judge him for going to a socialist globalist theater.

1090
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:39,880
I go see the Cubs game and the Ricketts are terrible fascist nightmare people.

1091
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,960
So what are you gonna do?

1092
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:49,480
I think that there is an argument to be made for like, if you have to, you can't watch

1093
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:55,160
the Cubs live except by paying for a ticket to go to Wrigley or, you know, I guess you

1094
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,040
could travel to another city.

1095
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:01,160
You can't watch them on TV without giving money to the Cubs that own their own goddamn

1096
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:01,560
network.

1097
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:02,200
They're evil.

1098
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,960
And you could make a similar argument that renting the movie at home would still be giving

1099
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,000
money to the studios and, you know, he doesn't support them.

1100
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,400
Whatever.

1101
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,040
I don't care.

1102
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,520
VPN torrent. Let's do this.

1103
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,120
Get off the grid, buddy.

1104
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:20,760
Still, I don't think it's a great idea to go to a movie theater in Austin right now.

1105
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,440
Maybe I would still judge that.

1106
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,240
I think that's wise.

1107
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:29,000
So anyway, Alex is cranky about this trip to the globalist socialist movie theater to

1108
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,440
see a brainwashing film.

1109
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:37,480
The only way to deal with that is to have a couple of news reporter babies come in.

1110
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:37,800
Sure.

1111
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,360
These two dicks.

1112
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:46,280
So it's Tom Papert and Patrick Howley, and they both work at National File, and they

1113
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:52,120
are just like, I can't look at them and not think that they're babies dressed up like

1114
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:52,600
adults.

1115
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,080
They just strike me as like, I don't know.

1116
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,920
The suits don't fit too well.

1117
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,840
They've got shoulder pads on.

1118
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:07,640
And they have these sort of skills and presentation of, I don't know, like, debate team

1119
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,240
junior high kids.

1120
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,760
Like, it's just outrageous.

1121
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,200
At the end of the performance, they both step away from their chairs.

1122
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,320
One of them gets on the other's shoulders, and they put their big trench coat on and

1123
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:17,880
walk out.

1124
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,200
Yeah.

1125
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:25,480
And they're like, Tom's a little bit beefy, and Patrick Howley seems like a little squirrely

1126
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:26,120
guy.

1127
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,880
And they're Laurel and Hardy-ing it.

1128
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:28,440
Oh, boy.

1129
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:33,400
The team of them, and realizing that they work at the same place, it's comical.

1130
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,400
I kind of want to write a sitcom about it.

1131
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,160
I will not, though.

1132
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,680
A nice little workplace comedy about those two evil fucks?

1133
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:46,760
I will just suffer through listening to these two horribly voiced people explain to me how

1134
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,960
Trump can seize power.

1135
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:53,720
A sitting US representative in the new Congress that will come in on January 3 needs to have

1136
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,240
in writing a written objection.

1137
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,920
We've got this from Mo Brooks.

1138
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:00,040
That written objection then needs to be mirrored in the Senate.

1139
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:04,200
If it is with Tommy Tuberville or any number of people, Rand Paul, I'm looking at you,

1140
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,600
Ted Cruz, looking at you, these are all of our heroes, right?

1141
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,880
Why haven't they agreed to do this?

1142
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,680
That's a very good question.

1143
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,760
Then if they have a senator agree, the two chambers break off and go meet and discuss

1144
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,760
the allegations of fraud, what they should do, whether they should strike these electoral

1145
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,920
votes, what the proper thing to do.

1146
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,960
And in all likelihood, Nancy Pelosi's house will say no.

1147
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,520
Arizona's Sharpie ballot markers were fine.

1148
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,720
That was just how elections were meant to be, according to the founding fathers.

1149
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:34,840
Meanwhile, if the Republicans have a spine, which we'll see if that happens, that's the

1150
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,920
big question, they'll come back and say, no, Arizona must be thrown out.

1151
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,800
It's then entirely up to Vice President Mike Pence as the presiding officer of the joint

1152
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,920
session of Congress.

1153
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,640
He gets to decide what to do with that information, Alex.

1154
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:52,040
So Mike Pence can say, all right, I'm siding with the Senate on this one.

1155
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,920
We're going to toss out Arizona.

1156
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,960
He can do that.

1157
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:00,680
Or Pence can do the safe thing, the expected thing.

1158
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,760
And he can say, there's no agreement.

1159
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,320
I do not want to cast a tie-breaking vote.

1160
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,560
Therefore, Arizona stands.

1161
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:11,640
I think the founding fathers would go ahead and throw out all the votes from non-whites

1162
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,120
and women.

1163
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

1164
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,480
I don't think they would worry too much about this election at all.

1165
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,400
Trump would have won in a landslide if the founding fathers had anything to say about

1166
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:19,560
it.

1167
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,360
Their definition of white might not be what yours is.

1168
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,600
It might be a little different.

1169
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,320
If we go by the founding fathers definition of votes, maybe 5 million would have been

1170
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,120
cast this year?

1171
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:30,440
Yeah.

1172
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,200
Bad news, Italians and Irish.

1173
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:32,920
You can't vote.

1174
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:36,920
Oh, God.

1175
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:37,080
Yeah.

1176
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,320
So that was Sharpies.

1177
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:39,880
Yeah.

1178
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,000
Get the fuck out of here.

1179
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,440
I will tell you this.

1180
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:48,440
If they find some Byzantine way where they're like, no, no, technically, I mean, I'm sorry,

1181
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:53,880
but according to legal code 206.C54, Trump is going to be president for the next four

1182
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:54,280
years.

1183
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,880
I'm going to start a war by myself.

1184
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:56,600
By myself.

1185
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,960
It'll be a war against...

1186
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,840
A Byzantine code rule.

1187
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,160
Yeah, it's not going to fly.

1188
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,080
This is just fan service.

1189
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,040
Yeah, exactly.

1190
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:13,320
So if this happened the way that Papert is discussing here, these objections would have

1191
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,800
to be brought up in the January 6th joint session of Congress, and then it would require

1192
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,200
a senator and representative to have signed on.

1193
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,520
Then each house would meet separately and debate the matter.

1194
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:30,440
So each objection, each state would have to have an objection with a senator and a

1195
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,640
representative signed on, and then they'd each have to be debated.

1196
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,520
We call on the right honorable senator from Kentucky.

1197
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:37,400
Yes.

1198
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,760
Do you believe in reality?

1199
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:39,560
No?

1200
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,160
Next person.

1201
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:45,640
So each house of Congress would then vote, and they would require a simple majority for

1202
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,240
the objection to stand.

1203
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:50,760
The objections would literally never pass the house, so you could just forget about

1204
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,160
that.

1205
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:56,360
And it seems nearly impossible for me to imagine that it would end up in a 50-50 tie in the

1206
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:01,720
Senate, which would be the only time when Mike Pence's vote would matter, because the

1207
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:08,440
only instance there would be like, okay, it's possible if both Democrats win in the Georgia

1208
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,480
runoff election.

1209
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,040
Sure.

1210
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:15,560
Then the vote in the Senate goes down strictly party lines, then we get to a 50-50.

1211
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,880
But that seems super unlikely.

1212
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:22,440
I find it really difficult to believe, even as craven and ghoulish as some of these GOP

1213
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,600
Congress people are, I can't imagine Mitt Romney voting along that line.

1214
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,440
No, well, they just heard my threat.

1215
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

1216
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,760
Rand Paul can't even debate me.

1217
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,480
Imagine if I started my own war against all of them.

1218
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,320
No, I think Rand Paul would go along with it.

1219
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,520
Yeah, no, I agree with that.

1220
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,080
I don't think that Mitt Romney would...

1221
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:49,400
There's a number of GOP senators that I don't think are secure enough in their position

1222
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,400
that they would go along with this.

1223
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,880
I think even McConnell's a toss up.

1224
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,880
Oh, he's too much of a craven dickwad.

1225
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,360
If he thought he could win, he'd win.

1226
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,560
But he couldn't.

1227
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,120
If he thought he would lose, he'd find some way to screw somebody else.

1228
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:02,920
But you couldn't.

1229
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:07,880
Even if you do this and you somehow get the objection to stand in the Senate, it still

1230
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,000
doesn't stand in the House.

1231
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,360
It doesn't matter.

1232
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:14,120
These statutes are really clear that in order for things like this to fly, there needs to

1233
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,680
be agreement in both houses of Congress.

1234
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:21,240
When there's an alternative slate of electors offered from each state in the House, they

1235
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:26,280
disagree on which to accept, quote, the statute states that the votes of the electors whose

1236
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:30,040
appointment was certified by the governor of the state shall be counted.

1237
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:35,160
The only outcome this is going to result in is like they're just going to draw this shit

1238
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,320
out, like the process is just going to get dragged out.

1239
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:42,200
They're going to stall any government operation and they're going to further radicalize and

1240
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:45,080
agitate the right wing elements who just can't accept that Trump lost.

1241
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:49,080
Tom Papert's out here creating this fantasy world for them to all live in.

1242
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:53,480
And then when that world does not materialize, it's just going to drive the audience deeper

1243
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,800
into the hole of resentment and insisting that the system is broken and can't be fixed.

1244
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:03,240
Like if these magical fantasy plans don't work, what hope does the actual process have?

1245
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:03,960
We're screwed.

1246
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,800
That's all that's going on here.

1247
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:08,600
Draw it out.

1248
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,560
Drag it out.

1249
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:15,720
Yeah, the problem is once you've exhausted all of your magical plans, then everybody

1250
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:21,000
who's believed that the magical plans could happen eventually has to go, nothing we do

1251
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:21,800
works.

1252
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,800
We have to do something different.

1253
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:31,000
And usually the thing that they think to do different is not like, let's get into actually

1254
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,320
organizing, community building.

1255
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:39,480
And that's because they don't ask, why are we always losing?

1256
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,520
Because they already know the answer.

1257
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,520
Can't be because the plans are magical.

1258
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,560
No, can't be that.

1259
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,280
It has to be because these people are so evil.

1260
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:49,480
They won't even follow the rules that we're, we're the good guys.

1261
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,120
We're trying to follow the rules and they won't.

1262
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,200
It's not that we're full of shit.

1263
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:54,520
Nope.

1264
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:54,840
Yep.

1265
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,560
Certainly not.

1266
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:59,480
So, so that's Tom Papert coming in with his magical Mike Pence plan.

1267
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:00,040
Love it.

1268
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,920
And then we get Patrick Hawley also on the call.

1269
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,560
All right.

1270
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,400
Just like really being a shithead.

1271
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,480
Well, Alex, first of all, I want to make clear because I just got a text.

1272
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:14,360
You know, nobody's considering replacing Mike Pence in the short term as a strategy, but

1273
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,720
mark my words that was looked into that was researched.

1274
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,600
Absolutely.

1275
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,680
No one has a free pass.

1276
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:24,600
If they're going to go against president Donald Trump, president Donald Trump is the Republican

1277
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,160
party.

1278
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:29,480
President Donald Trump is this movement and the American people are desperate to keep

1279
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,200
them in here.

1280
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:35,720
So actually I looked into this a little bit and I found a mission statement for Patrick

1281
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,760
Hawley's politics.

1282
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,000
Sure.

1283
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,680
Um, there is no loyalty except loyalty to Donald Trump.

1284
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:43,000
There's no love except love for Donald Trump.

1285
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,520
There is no laughter except the laugh of triumph over Antifa.

1286
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,840
There is no art, no literature, no science.

1287
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,640
When we are omnipotent, we shall have no more need for science.

1288
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,600
There'll be no distinction between beauty and ugliness.

1289
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,720
There'll be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life.

1290
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,960
All competing pleasures will be destroyed, but always do not forget this Winston.

1291
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:05,400
There will always be the intoxication of power constantly increasing.

1292
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,280
You get where I'm going.

1293
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1294
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:12,440
Dude, get a, get a, get a job that does do something good.

1295
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,720
Become a bricklayer.

1296
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,600
Do something good with your life instead of writing that.

1297
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,400
Sweat a little bit.

1298
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:17,880
Just do something.

1299
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,080
He didn't actually write that.

1300
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:30,520
I mean, it's spiritually in line with, uh, so, uh, Patrick Hawley's a little bit too

1301
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,400
like obvious.

1302
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,120
Here's what's going to happen on January 6th.

1303
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:39,560
It's great independent media like Tom and Alex Jones are going to show the world in

1304
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:45,160
real time, all of the evidence that the courts have not been making public to the people

1305
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,080
and the Supreme court won't even hear.

1306
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:52,360
And I know Matt Gates is going to fight and I know we can drag it out for hours upon hours

1307
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:56,280
upon hours and create a maximum pressure scenario.

1308
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:01,320
And that's why what we're doing is going to really make an impact.

1309
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,040
So that was showing a few too many cards.

1310
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:08,840
Patrick Hawley knows that the only thing they're going to achieve is this big dumb dumb publicity

1311
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:13,240
stunt and they're going to extend the process by however long they can to maximize profits.

1312
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:18,200
Unfortunately, according to the US code, each objection that gets made is limited to two

1313
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:22,760
hours of debate with no Congress person being allowed more than five minutes to speak or

1314
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,880
question the matter.

1315
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:27,240
You can do the math if you want, but according to the law, there's only so much they can

1316
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,680
drag this way.

1317
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,280
So good luck.

1318
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,760
Enjoy dumb Jesus.

1319
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:41,000
So Alex wants Tom and Pat to close things out by explaining, Hey, who are them globalists?

1320
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:41,320
All right.

1321
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,920
And in my note, I just have here, these people are fucking nuts.

1322
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:45,420
Okay.

1323
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,040
30 seconds or one minute each.

1324
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,520
How would you describe in one minute, Papert the globalist?

1325
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,960
Well, what you started to say is accurate.

1326
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:58,360
It's a collection of psychopaths who have figured out that they can leverage blackmail,

1327
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:03,960
extortion, bribery, everything you can get to keep a seat in power, no matter what country

1328
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,080
is the global hegemon.

1329
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,520
If it's the United States, that's great.

1330
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,040
If it's China, who cares?

1331
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,320
I think that that is the globalist.

1332
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,280
They are power drunk.

1333
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:14,840
They are sick and they don't, they have no loyalties to anything but power.

1334
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:17,480
Well, they might have loyalty to ball, to a malloc.

1335
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:17,880
That's true.

1336
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,600
And you know, these are, these are baby killing Satanists.

1337
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,320
They are overseeing a genocide of little babies.

1338
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,200
They're sick people.

1339
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,480
They have a religion.

1340
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:28,840
They believe that they're, you know, descended from the Nephilim bloodlines.

1341
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,920
It's a satanic Luciferian cult.

1342
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:31,420
Wow.

1343
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,800
I just don't understand.

1344
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:37,080
Yeah.

1345
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:37,800
Just don't.

1346
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,120
Our enemies believe that they're descended from the Nephilim.

1347
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:42,600
It's not.

1348
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,920
No, they don't.

1349
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,040
They don't.

1350
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:46,520
Wow.

1351
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,800
They don't exist.

1352
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,760
You just don't know about what they talk about behind closed doors.

1353
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,720
They don't exist.

1354
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,240
Really say that out loud.

1355
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:53,640
Nephilim bloodlines.

1356
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,920
Say that out loud.

1357
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,360
Our enemies believe they're descended from the Nephilim.

1358
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,000
Okay.

1359
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,120
The biblical giants.

1360
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:00,360
Bye.

1361
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:01,640
Bye.

1362
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:02,360
Goodbye.

1363
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,000
Yep.

1364
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,400
Goodbye, Tom Papert and Patrick Cowley.

1365
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:09,880
You have comported yourself exactly how one would expect, which is not well.

1366
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:10,440
Yeah.

1367
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:11,480
So, um, Alex-

1368
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,720
Go try and steal booze from somebody.

1369
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:17,080
Two toddlers wearing a goddamn fucking, ugh.

1370
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:21,400
Alex has a really important like sort of structural public service announcement that I think is

1371
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,400
actually really, really key for the Infowarriors to take to heart.

1372
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,560
Brother, I absolutely agree with you.

1373
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:31,240
And we have to physically not support the big globalist chains.

1374
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,000
Sometimes we still will be forced to.

1375
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,080
We have to physically support mom and pops.

1376
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:36,920
You have to understand it's a war.

1377
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:42,920
Didn't you go see Wonder Woman at a socialist globalist movie theater on opening weekend?

1378
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,080
Look, Alamo Drafthouse isn't a huge chain.

1379
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,320
It's not AMC or anything like that.

1380
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,920
I think you're supporting mom and pop.

1381
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:53,800
I mean, obviously mom and pop evil globalist socialists, but you know, there's still room

1382
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,800
for that small business globalism.

1383
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,360
Opening weekend, movie I hate.

1384
01:12:58,920 --> 01:12:59,240
Great.

1385
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:06,200
So Alex goes back to calls and this caller actually brings up what I would say is a good

1386
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:06,600
point.

1387
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,080
It's a logical extension of a lot of Alex's ideas.

1388
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:09,800
All right.

1389
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:16,680
I'd love to see in the future your show maybe focus on, or a new show maybe focus on how

1390
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:22,600
we start setting up new systems and societies to get outside of the mainstream society and

1391
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:27,320
What you're saying is 100% the answer.

1392
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:33,080
We should all just be focusing on communities, neighborhoods, towns, organizations, free

1393
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:37,800
association groups where we want a pro-human future, where we want traditional values,

1394
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:43,560
where we honor life, where we honor children, where we honor goodness, because they've

1395
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,960
overtaken the churches and control most of those.

1396
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,280
And so we need something that I don't even use the word secular, but something that's

1397
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,000
just human and saying, we reject death.

1398
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,080
We reject the wages of the new world order.

1399
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:55,560
God bless you.

1400
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,600
And I appreciate your call.

1401
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:56,760
Yeah.

1402
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:00,760
So I mean, this caller is essentially bringing up like, Hey, why don't we talk more about

1403
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:01,960
setting up some communes?

1404
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,160
Yeah, yeah.

1405
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:03,560
You know what?

1406
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:07,640
We should, we should set up those communes, but that does sound a lot like what the dirty

1407
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,320
globalists want to do.

1408
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:09,640
Shit.

1409
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,000
We're stuck.

1410
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,960
Our imaginary enemies have solutions that we don't like because they're also, God damn

1411
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:16,120
it.

1412
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,800
We have to make a rural autonomous zone as opposed to autonomous zones in cities.

1413
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,400
Yeah, completely different.

1414
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:28,680
So Joel Skousen shows up and, uh, the, the conversation about this dumb elector plan

1415
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:34,760
that Tom Papert was pitching earlier, uh, comes up and, and I'll say to Skousen's credit,

1416
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,120
he doesn't go in for that bullshit.

1417
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,240
He thinks it's a dumb plan.

1418
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:39,720
It's going to be very easy to block.

1419
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:43,160
It doesn't matter how many people are in favor of the Trump electors.

1420
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,240
All it takes is two or three to block.

1421
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,960
And I think that's, what's going to happen in the Senate.

1422
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,240
Is there any path to victory now for Trump?

1423
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,200
Disrespectful.

1424
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,040
Eating a little bit.

1425
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:54,920
Disrespectful.

1426
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,120
Eating a little bit.

1427
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:56,600
Yeah.

1428
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,560
Having a little bite.

1429
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:02,920
So I will say that Skousen is, I will tip my hat to him in terms of him, you know, saying

1430
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,360
that this plan is dumb.

1431
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:05,400
Yes.

1432
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:10,840
I will retract my hat at this point when he starts talking about, there was that story

1433
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:15,160
that was going around about, uh, uh, John Roberts, chief justice of the Supreme Court,

1434
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,160
yelling about how we can't take up this case.

1435
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:17,800
Absolutely.

1436
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,440
Um, listen to this idiot.

1437
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:20,760
Okay.

1438
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:23,640
Listen to this idiot Joel Skousen talk about that story.

1439
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,040
All right.

1440
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:25,400
This guy's a fucking idiot.

1441
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:25,640
Okay.

1442
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:32,440
As you know, there was this supposed leak from the Supreme Court, which I'm a little

1443
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:37,080
bit doubtful of stating that John Roberts, you know, had a yelling and screaming session

1444
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:43,480
threatening conservatives into, uh, uh, not taking up the Texas case for fear of rioting

1445
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,120
the United States.

1446
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:47,720
If we ever, you know, allow Trump to be reelected.

1447
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:53,320
Well, the Supreme Court came out the next day and said, uh, there was no such yelling

1448
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:58,920
match because, uh, the, the, the Supreme Court justice haven't met in person for weeks because

1449
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,080
of COVID-19 everything is done by zoom meeting.

1450
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:06,280
But another person had said, well, it's very possible they did meet in person because John

1451
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:10,600
Roberts wouldn't have wanted to put this on zoom, which is not a secure form of communications.

1452
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:14,520
It could have been tapped and leaked to the American people what he was saying on that.

1453
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:20,680
So I think there's good arguments in both cases, but this much, I do know Alex, that

1454
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,400
John Roberts is a controlled individual by the deep state.

1455
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:23,880
Of course.

1456
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:29,000
And he did in fact, and would in fact always vote against Trump to make sure he's not reelected.

1457
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,280
What a fucking idiot.

1458
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,160
All right.

1459
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:35,720
So, uh, I, I doubt this story even happened.

1460
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,000
Great start.

1461
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:37,400
Okay.

1462
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,160
Great start to launch this ship.

1463
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:44,440
And they told me that it didn't happen because the only zoom meetings have happened for weeks.

1464
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,760
Um, my rebuttal to that is what if they did?

1465
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:49,260
Yeah.

1466
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,160
Whoa.

1467
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:51,480
Yeah.

1468
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,200
That's a good one.

1469
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:52,920
Skousen.

1470
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:56,600
What if instead of the thing that's real, they did the thing that I say?

1471
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,120
Skousen, I'm going to fucking subscribe to your newsletter, man.

1472
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,000
You were killing it.

1473
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:06,040
Fucking that level of reasoning is being brought to this.

1474
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:06,680
What if?

1475
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,160
All right.

1476
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:12,600
Now I know the sun rose yesterday, but what if it didn't, what would we say then?

1477
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:17,560
I would guess that any communication between Supreme court justices is not something that

1478
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,000
anyone would want to leak.

1479
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,320
And therefore this meeting would not be different or special from any other meeting.

1480
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:28,840
Any other meeting, if any is being done on zoom, I would assume it's probably a hyper

1481
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,840
secure, special zoom.

1482
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,280
It's like the zoom that you and I use.

1483
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,160
I would doubt it.

1484
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:34,120
I would doubt it.

1485
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:34,760
Very stupid.

1486
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,880
Although very, very stupid reasoning skills.

1487
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:38,920
Very dumb.

1488
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,440
Um, analysis.

1489
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:46,600
I will say as we found out when we did our bonus episode over zoom, it's not even possible

1490
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,320
for John Roberts to scream at somebody through zoom.

1491
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:52,680
It cuts your volume off if you're anywhere near as loud as me.

1492
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:53,880
That might've been your laptop.

1493
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,520
That could be me.

1494
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,800
But, uh, it's unclear.

1495
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:00,040
So anyway, uh, we're gonna end this episode here and jump to the 29th.

1496
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:01,800
Skousen, who cares?

1497
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,120
You just talked about how you need to live an hour outside of town.

1498
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,800
I want to move an hour outside of town.

1499
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:10,200
I don't not want to, but I also don't care to hear Skousen talk about it.

1500
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,400
So we, uh, we jumped to the 29th here.

1501
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,920
This is delightful.

1502
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,520
I find this a lot of fun.

1503
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:21,960
Alex decides to, uh, to kick things off by teasing a little bit, but then he's like,

1504
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:26,200
I'm not going to tell you what I'm teasing about, but it's a little, but it's a little

1505
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:26,760
too obvious.

1506
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:33,000
Now I know some incredible information that I am not at liberty to tell you, but I am

1507
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,360
at liberty to just give you a hint, which I don't think is too hard.

1508
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,200
You notice Trump said January 6th will be wild in DC.

1509
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,400
Well, it will be wild.

1510
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:50,120
And I can tell you the twilight zone nature of all of this went up to a whole new level

1511
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,040
yesterday and I'll leave it at that.

1512
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:54,600
Alex keeps trying to hit the Trump's going to come to the rallies.

1513
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1514
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:56,200
It's very simple.

1515
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,600
I love the idea of somebody being like, look, here's some information.

1516
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,040
You can't tell anybody that you can hint.

1517
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:06,040
Hey, listen, don't give away the information.

1518
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:06,840
Make it a puzzle.

1519
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:11,720
This is really serious and you got to be on the up and up about this.

1520
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,600
Now I'm not going to tell you what, how to hint.

1521
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:19,400
I'm not going to give you any lines that you can't cross, but I'm not going to say make

1522
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,080
it too easy or too hard.

1523
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:21,960
I'm not going to say that.

1524
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,440
I just want you to put your own spin on it.

1525
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:24,760
Yeah.

1526
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,560
All right.

1527
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:29,320
So yesterday's show, the 28th, was kind of disappointing in a lot of ways.

1528
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,600
There wasn't a lot of content.

1529
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,280
There's a lot of stupid shit.

1530
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,840
Anytime those two dum-dums are on the show, it's bad.

1531
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:35,640
Yeah, yeah.

1532
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,840
Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

1533
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:37,340
Yeah.

1534
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:42,840
And then there's a lot of Wonder Woman complaining and I found it to be uninspired even by Alex

1535
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,240
standards, but there was a problem.

1536
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,160
Did he even talk about Pedro Pascal?

1537
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:47,560
No.

1538
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,000
Because it's amazing.

1539
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,320
Yeah.

1540
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,040
He's so good.

1541
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:50,760
I'm sure he is.

1542
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:51,320
He's amazing.

1543
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:54,920
But look, there was a problem with the show that was structural.

1544
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:55,480
Okay.

1545
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,320
It was beyond what I could observe.

1546
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:58,840
Okay.

1547
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,920
Let me just kind of calmly explain this.

1548
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:07,560
I got prepared for yesterday's show for several days and then I got so upset after looking

1549
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,800
at all the news and evidence and over preparing.

1550
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:10,600
Watching Wonder Woman.

1551
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,240
That I was in such a nasty mood when I started the show yesterday.

1552
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,840
Because you watched Wonder Woman.

1553
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,280
Yeah, man, I over prepared.

1554
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:21,000
I just couldn't get my job done because I was too prepared again.

1555
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:21,400
Okay.

1556
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:21,960
So...

1557
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,560
Constantly over prepared.

1558
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:27,560
Whining about Wonder Woman happened because he was too prepared.

1559
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:28,120
Too prepared.

1560
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:28,680
Too prepared.

1561
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:29,160
Okay.

1562
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:29,480
All right.

1563
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,440
And angry.

1564
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,440
And someone named Diana called in.

1565
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,400
Well, then you gotta.

1566
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:33,720
Yeah.

1567
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,360
You just gotta.

1568
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,360
Look, I don't blame him for that.

1569
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:38,280
I would have done the same in that situation.

1570
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:41,000
And then today he's like, I ought to make good on it.

1571
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,280
You know, I had all this over preparation yesterday.

1572
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,440
Now I must pay off that over preparation.

1573
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,080
All right, here we go.

1574
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,640
So what he decides to do is show off like a baby might.

1575
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,440
Whine about Wonder Woman.

1576
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,440
Let me show you just the COVID stacks.

1577
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,600
One is from yesterday.

1578
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,720
Three are from today.

1579
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,240
So I have four stacks right here.

1580
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,080
Four COVID stacks.

1581
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,400
Now look at this stack.

1582
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,360
Look at this one.

1583
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,640
Look at all these stacks.

1584
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:04,760
I have so much paper.

1585
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:06,920
I've seen...

1586
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:11,320
Look, I've been in the pool hustling game for a while.

1587
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:12,120
I'll tell you right now.

1588
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:15,720
I've seen, I know when somebody has some fake ones.

1589
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:16,040
All right.

1590
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,040
I know what's underneath that role.

1591
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,000
I know what's going on.

1592
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,120
This is somebody who's like padded an essay to hit the word limit.

1593
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:25,640
That's how it feels.

1594
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,080
Like, oh, look at all this paper.

1595
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,360
I've read all this.

1596
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:32,040
I know you said size 14, but what if I can get away with a size 15?

1597
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,640
That's one less word per page.

1598
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:34,040
Yeah.

1599
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:34,360
Yeah.

1600
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:39,720
It's so much a desperate attempt to trick people into thinking he's prepared at all

1601
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,720
because it visually looks like he might have.

1602
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,640
There's so much paper out here.

1603
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:49,960
I would be more impressed if he had nothing, but it's all just a magic trick.

1604
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:56,600
Anyway, Alex, apparently the story is another level of deep COVID denialism that again was

1605
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:00,280
like the kind of thing that I just had to walk away from, breathe a little bit and just

1606
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,560
be like, oh, fuck you, man.

1607
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:04,760
So again, they're like, oh, we're turning people away.

1608
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:11,720
Well, that's like saying one restaurant is full, but there's 10 more next door that aren't.

1609
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,240
That's how they statistically manipulated.

1610
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:14,920
But I don't just, I'm not just going to tell you that.

1611
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,920
We're going to show you where you can go directly into the CDC's own numbers and see what every

1612
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:25,560
hospital in your town or city has because the COVID cases are all reported because they're

1613
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,800
all incentivized to call it COVID to get money.

1614
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,600
And most of these people don't even need to be in the hospital.

1615
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:37,400
But Travis County is at, as of last night, 9% COVID capacity.

1616
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:48,120
There are 77 people in hospitals in Austin, in Travis County, that supposedly have COVID.

1617
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:53,720
We're talking millions of people, 77 in the hospital.

1618
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:57,400
Alex is desperately trying to spin the news stories that have been coming out about how

1619
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:01,880
hospitals are going to have to start talking about rationing care because they can't handle

1620
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:04,680
the load of patients with the surge of COVID-19 cases.

1621
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:09,160
Obviously, this is something that people have been warning about for a long time, and everything

1622
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:13,080
Alex has stood for has been the exact things that people warned would cause the need to

1623
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,720
ration care and turn people away from hospitals.

1624
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:19,800
The fact that we've reached the point we have should be a sign that people like Alex Jones

1625
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:24,040
have been a cancerous influence on the public information space and that his recommendations

1626
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:26,760
have led exactly where everyone knew they would.

1627
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:30,760
So it's super important for him to act like all this is imaginary or something.

1628
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:34,680
The way he chooses to do it is by covering the story like a fifth grader doing a book

1629
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,640
report about a novel he's only pretending to have read.

1630
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:41,080
There's a couple of details that he got from reading the back cover that he's hitting really

1631
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,560
hard in order to fake like he knows what he's talking about.

1632
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:49,560
A December 28 article in the Austin Statesman reported that the ICU occupancy in Travis

1633
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,160
County rose 62% in just the previous week.

1634
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:59,160
The county has a maximum ICU availability of 200 patients and they were at 132 on Monday

1635
01:23:59,160 --> 01:23:59,960
night.

1636
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:05,800
There were 422 hospitalizations in the county linked to COVID-19 as of the time of the writing

1637
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:06,600
of that article.

1638
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:10,600
I was trying to get a sense of what Alex would possibly be talking about because the numbers

1639
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:14,280
that he's using are just completely out of sync with anything I can find reported anywhere.

1640
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:19,000
I looked at the Austin COVID-19 surveillance dashboard and I think I figured out where

1641
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,680
he got the 77 number from.

1642
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:25,000
I think that was the number of people listed as on ventilators at the time that he looked

1643
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,200
at the data.

1644
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:30,920
By December 31st that number was up to 81 but it seems like the number could have possibly

1645
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:33,160
be close to what he was saying at the time that he read it.

1646
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:38,120
And I actually found a Statesman article from earlier this week that cited that the number

1647
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:44,840
of people on ventilators was 77 in Austin on Monday when this episode was recorded so

1648
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:45,880
I'm pretty sure that's what he's...

1649
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,080
That sounds about right, yeah.

1650
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:52,520
Yeah, what's outrageous about this, if this is what he's going off of, like this

1651
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:57,240
misinterpretation, is that right next to the ventilator number on the COVID-19 dashboard

1652
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:02,040
is the hospitalized figure in twice as large a font which is much higher.

1653
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:07,400
If Alex actually had looked to find these numbers it would be literally impossible for

1654
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:10,120
him to miss that one and see the other one.

1655
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:13,560
It kind of heavily implies that either he's just repeating something that someone told

1656
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:18,200
him which is inaccurate or he's willfully passing along inaccurate information in order

1657
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:22,920
to minimize the public health risk posed by COVID-19 which stands a very good chance of

1658
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,440
getting extra people killed.

1659
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:29,400
I mean, well, I mean he just saw Wonder Woman so whenever he read that his brain was all

1660
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:29,800
messed up.

1661
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,760
He thought that the smaller number was the only number that you could see.

1662
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,120
That's what happens with Wonder Woman.

1663
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:34,680
Is that right?

1664
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,360
Yeah, you can't see large numbers anymore.

1665
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:36,760
Shit.

1666
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,360
Yeah, I know, it's a real bummer.

1667
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:38,760
Fuck.

1668
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:42,520
Write something bigger than 16-point font and I cannot read it.

1669
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:42,920
Oh no.

1670
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,040
Yeah, I know, it's brutal.

1671
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:48,760
Also in terms of deaths, the city of Austin put out a press release on December 30th announcing

1672
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:52,920
that COVID-19 was the third highest cause of death this year behind only cancer and

1673
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,120
heart disease.

1674
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:57,160
The number is at least 548 this year.

1675
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,560
If you do a little bit of math, that's north of one a week.

1676
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:05,240
Also, I know it's not possible, but I wish you would just stop doing stuff like this.

1677
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:10,760
It's so much more fun when it's Wonder Woman, Illuminati symbols, and fake Jefferson quotes.

1678
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,440
It sucks.

1679
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:13,960
It blows me away.

1680
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:22,040
I understand it because I have never been able to just light $20,000 on fire whenever

1681
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:27,800
I wanted to, but it never fails to surprise me what people will be convinced is enough

1682
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,880
to corrupt somebody.

1683
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:36,840
This whole, like, oh, they get an extra 20 grand out of, it says COVID in an ICU and

1684
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,680
it's like, that's nothing.

1685
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:43,000
The people that you are describing as being the evil billionaires that are destroying

1686
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:49,480
everything would fucking put $20,000 under their shoes just to feel like what it's, to

1687
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:50,120
step on money.

1688
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:52,200
It is nothing.

1689
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:56,600
But there's a secondary conversation even past that, that that money that's being discussed

1690
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,360
isn't like some kind of a bonus.

1691
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:59,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1692
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,600
It's payment for care.

1693
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:01,000
Yeah.

1694
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,360
Like it's Medicare payments.

1695
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:03,000
Yeah.

1696
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,800
So like, do you think that people who have other things don't also have payments attached

1697
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,240
to them like a heart attack?

1698
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,400
Do you think that maybe might be more?

1699
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,200
No, no, no, no.

1700
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:16,040
If you go in for a cough and you have a heart attack, they still only pay for the cough.

1701
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:19,400
They're not giving people bonuses just for having a heart attack in the hospital, Dan.

1702
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:24,200
He's imagining that like this number is zero for other things and then, oh, we incentivize.

1703
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,080
Yeah, yeah.

1704
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:26,360
It's just so stupid.

1705
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:27,000
It's pathetic.

1706
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,480
But yes, that number is also like really big to people like us.

1707
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:31,960
Yeah, no.

1708
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:35,320
And comically small to people like Bezos.

1709
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:39,880
It's one of those things that it's hilarious to me whenever people are like, oh, man, your

1710
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:43,480
House of Representatives make like $140,000 a year.

1711
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:46,520
And it's like, yes, I know that's a lot of money to you and me.

1712
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:51,960
But to the oligarchs who own them, they can shit out $140,000 every five seconds.

1713
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:54,520
Like it is so little.

1714
01:27:54,520 --> 01:28:03,560
The real scale of corruption that we are existing in is world like the country is what corruption

1715
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:08,520
where like somebody could be like, okay, I will corrupt you if you own Sudan now.

1716
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:12,040
Like that's the level of billionaire evil corruption we're dealing with.

1717
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,360
I think I get what you're saying in terms of scale.

1718
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:14,920
Yeah.

1719
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,120
So I thought that was bad.

1720
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:23,000
I thought that Alex is claiming that 77 people are hospitalized with COVID-19 in Travis County,

1721
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,360
which is demonstrably not true and very, very bad.

1722
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:27,240
I thought that was bad.

1723
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,000
But then this is worse, I think.

1724
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,320
We've got Kyle Rittenhouse's mother.

1725
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,880
No, no.

1726
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:39,000
She did her first interview yesterday with Owen Schroyer.

1727
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:39,960
I was like up here working.

1728
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,040
I was like, wow, she's got a lot to say.

1729
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,800
I haven't seen her on TV and they're like, no, this is, I think, her first interview.

1730
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:50,920
So she'll be joining us with her lawyer about the incredible persecution of the Rittenhouses.

1731
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:53,640
That's a beta test for the rest of us in the third hour.

1732
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,440
Oh boy.

1733
01:28:54,440 --> 01:29:00,280
So whenever that does end up happening, Alex cannot stop saying We Are All Kyle Rittenhouse.

1734
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:00,840
Jesus.

1735
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,120
It's very uncomfortable.

1736
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:03,080
That's not good.

1737
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:04,280
No, it's a bad interview.

1738
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:07,240
And we'll get to a little bit of it to end this episode.

1739
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:13,160
We Are All Murderers, however, is something that I would say that Alex is correct on.

1740
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:13,480
Spiritually.

1741
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,160
If that's what he's describing, yeah.

1742
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:20,280
So we got to get back to this hospital hoax first though, that Alex is going to blow the lid off.

1743
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:20,520
Great.

1744
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:24,280
Man, this guy is an in-depth journalist.

1745
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:33,080
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to lay out for you the absolute proof of total criminal

1746
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:40,760
fraud by the hospitals, by the media, by the CDC, because they go on the news and they

1747
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,000
say, we've got to lock down the economy.

1748
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,760
You can't leave your house for a few months.

1749
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,960
We're going to have 2.5 million dead in just a few months.

1750
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:52,280
The hospitals are already overwhelmed and the people went to the very hospitals.

1751
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:53,800
You saw the hundreds of videos.

1752
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:54,040
Yeah.

1753
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:57,720
I remember when everybody took pictures of parking lots and pretended that no one was

1754
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:58,360
at the hospital.

1755
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,000
Yeah, I remember that.

1756
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,160
You guys are all dogged industrial.

1757
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:01,480
Yeah.

1758
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,560
So Alex rambles about nonsense for a bit.

1759
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:05,240
I'm like, what are you actually talking about?

1760
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,440
And he finally gets down to it.

1761
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:08,520
And it was an article in NPR that he found.

1762
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:08,840
Sure.

1763
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:13,800
Federal data reveals which hospitals are dangerously full this week is yours.

1764
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:19,160
And then you link to the federal government CDC website from in PR, but they know you're

1765
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:19,880
not going to link through.

1766
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:25,560
No, you know, you know, federal shows you've got a billion dollars in your bank account,

1767
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:26,360
but you really don't.

1768
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:31,240
We have federal data reveals which hospitals are dangerously full.

1769
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:32,520
This week is yours.

1770
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:37,000
So what's going on here is that Alex is upset about an article he didn't read in NPR, where

1771
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,040
they had some links that I guess he's certain no one followed.

1772
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:44,120
I'm certain that Alex didn't do any original research on this, nor do I believe that he

1773
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:47,800
went and looked at the raw data because I'm certain he would be unable to read the Excel

1774
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:48,520
spreadsheet.

1775
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:51,240
It's a lot of it's a lot of rows.

1776
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:51,880
Yeah.

1777
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:56,680
He's talking about the data visualization that NPR posted, which does show that Travis

1778
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:00,600
County has 9% of its known inpatient beds used for COVID patients.

1779
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:04,680
The problem with that stat on its own is that it's meaningless.

1780
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:09,320
For instance, if Alex looked a little bit deeper into the data, he'd see that nine out

1781
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:12,680
of 15 Austin hospitals are not included in the data set.

1782
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:15,080
So it's a little incomplete in terms of getting the full picture.

1783
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,120
Well, that's a struggle.

1784
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:20,760
But even beyond that, the problem isn't that all the beds are being taken up by COVID patients.

1785
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:24,920
It's that with a rise in COVID patients, the hospitals will reach their capacity and have

1786
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,560
no beds left for anybody else who might need treatment.

1787
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:32,040
That's why a more than surface level analysis of this data is important.

1788
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:36,600
So let's take St. David's Medical Center in Austin as an example.

1789
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:41,400
They show 7% of their adult inpatient beds being taken up for COVID patients.

1790
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:42,600
That seems like nothing.

1791
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:43,880
A drop in the bucket at 7%.

1792
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:50,120
However, if you look at the next column, you'll see that 93% of their total adult inpatient

1793
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:51,320
beds are occupied.

1794
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:55,080
So any increases in COVID patients would be a disaster for them.

1795
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,880
You see this in many of the included Austin hospitals.

1796
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:04,360
Ascension Seton Medical Center has 13% of its beds taken by COVID patients, but 90%

1797
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,880
total occupied.

1798
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:11,160
Dell Seton Medical Center at UT Austin has 23% of its beds taken by COVID patients, but

1799
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:13,560
94% are occupied total.

1800
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:20,600
For North Austin Medical Center, 10% are COVID patients, but 94% total are occupied.

1801
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,120
This is the pattern that is the important piece.

1802
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:28,600
The concern is definitely partially that there are a lot of COVID patients that need to be

1803
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:33,000
treated, but the larger picture has to take into account that hospitals have a certain

1804
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,080
capacity, and even beyond that, they only have a certain amount of human attention that

1805
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,760
can be provided to patients.

1806
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:43,240
You can't magically create doctors and nurses in a 3D printer, so even if you add a ton

1807
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:48,760
of beds, or put patients who should be in the ICU in non-ICU beds, it's not like that

1808
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,600
part of the equation can be balanced out.

1809
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:55,720
This is the sort of context that Alex deprives his audience of, because he thinks that he

1810
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:58,920
is a slam dunk with the optics of this 9% statistic.

1811
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:04,040
He can yell that 9% all he wants, but it doesn't change the reality that it's far more complex

1812
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:06,200
than surface level faked book reports.

1813
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:06,760
Yeah.

1814
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:09,160
I feel like I might be saying this a lot, but this shit's disgraceful.

1815
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,720
Like, it's just, it's infantile bullshit.

1816
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:17,960
This elevator has 100 people on it, and there's only an increase in 9% of COVID patients

1817
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:18,840
adding to the elevator.

1818
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:24,360
I mean, sure, the maximum capacity is 50, and the elevator's going to fall, and everyone's

1819
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:25,320
going to die.

1820
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:26,040
Well, it's only 9.

1821
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:29,000
But you can fit an extra 9% in there.

1822
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:35,800
It's interesting when you either willfully or are unable to understand the complexities

1823
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:38,280
of things, and then you gloat about it.

1824
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:39,000
Yeah.

1825
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,840
So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.

1826
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:45,880
St. David's is at 7% capacity.

1827
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:50,680
Uh-oh, St. David's South Austin Medical Center is at 20% capacity.

1828
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:55,240
Uh-oh, Ascension Seton.

1829
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:57,480
Oh, no, this one.

1830
01:33:58,440 --> 01:33:59,720
They're at 13%.

1831
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:00,840
Oh, no, we're all dead.

1832
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,760
You average together 9% capacity.

1833
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:05,080
Again, those are the hospitals that we just discussed.

1834
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:09,880
It's not, he's not taking into account the larger picture, and he's gloating about missing

1835
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:13,560
the point, which is kind of, like, exactly what Alex does.

1836
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:14,280
I mean, it's perfect.

1837
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:19,080
I'm going to cut out this next clip because it's pointless, but I just thought it was

1838
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:23,080
pretty funny that Alex claims that he fact-checked Johns Hopkins.

1839
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:23,880
All right.

1840
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:24,520
All right, Alex.

1841
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:25,960
I just thought that was really funny.

1842
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:26,680
Get the fuck out of here.

1843
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:29,400
Alex sitting there with, like, bifocals on, like, what?

1844
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:30,200
Hold on.

1845
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:36,440
Yeah, using my CPA, I've gone through and taken care of Johns Hopkins' numbers.

1846
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:40,200
I just thought that was really funny, just the mental image of it, but it pales in comparison

1847
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,040
to how excited I got when I heard this clip.

1848
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:42,840
Okay.

1849
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:43,800
So there's facts.

1850
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:48,680
Now, I haven't hit the latest, the actual UN document where they admit it's all a hoax,

1851
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:51,880
and for power and control, bigger than the great reset.

1852
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,480
It was first in a Canadian document.

1853
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:56,440
They tried to say, well, we're not sure what's real, but we were able to search the document

1854
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:59,320
and find other documents from other countries that confirm it is real.

1855
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,120
We have you now.

1856
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:02,920
We'll be back.

1857
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,840
Hour number two, straight ahead.

1858
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,520
This is the Info War.

1859
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,400
God damn, he's so excited.

1860
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,000
I am pumped.

1861
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,440
We have you now.

1862
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:13,160
Yeah.

1863
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:13,800
You better...

1864
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:14,520
He got him.

1865
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:17,320
You better fucking follow through on We Have You Now.

1866
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:18,040
Dude, he got him.

1867
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:18,600
You have...

1868
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:22,200
If you have them now, you better now have them.

1869
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:23,160
You know me pretty well.

1870
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:24,760
You know that's something that gets me excited.

1871
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:26,280
When Alex drops something like that on my lap.

1872
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:26,920
We have them now.

1873
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:27,800
It's a document.

1874
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,640
We have them now, not later.

1875
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:31,400
We're not going to get them soon.

1876
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,920
Now is when we have them.

1877
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:33,960
Yeah, but we'll get back to that.

1878
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:34,680
All right.

1879
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:35,480
Because Alex...

1880
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:36,600
See, but we have them now.

1881
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,640
We should be getting to it now.

1882
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,720
You can't get back to something that we have now.

1883
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:41,560
There's more important things going on.

1884
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:42,520
We have them.

1885
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:43,160
Nope.

1886
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:43,480
Okay.

1887
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:45,640
There's Epstein.

1888
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:46,040
Mariam.

1889
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:48,840
I should have known.

1890
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:49,800
He had a cellmate.

1891
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:50,840
I should have guessed.

1892
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:52,600
And that cellmate just died of COVID.

1893
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:53,000
Sure.

1894
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,120
And now this is a conspiracy.

1895
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,160
Now it's a conspiracy.

1896
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,880
Epstein liked to read a lot and he kept himself.

1897
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:00,520
He wasn't a problem starter or too loud.

1898
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,440
My uncle said he was a good cellmate.

1899
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:10,200
His niece said the Daily News reports that Reyes was transferred to a private prison

1900
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:13,960
the day before Epstein hanged himself in August 2019.

1901
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:17,320
And it was there that he contracted the coronavirus.

1902
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:24,280
Oh, so he was found dead in his apartment and they're telling you it was coronavirus.

1903
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:26,680
Let me tell you who else died of COVID-19.

1904
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,920
Please pull up the Sir Bruder film, please.

1905
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:30,520
That's right.

1906
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:35,960
Little did you know, but the coronavirus COVID-19 got in the time machine and went back to Dallas.

1907
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:43,160
I think he thought of that bit before he realized that the cellmate wasn't there when Epstein died.

1908
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:43,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1909
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:45,640
I think he found that out on air.

1910
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:46,140
Yeah.

1911
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:52,040
I could sense a really strong, like, oh, damn it.

1912
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,240
Oh, shit.

1913
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,400
I thought this was the person I was going to pin the murder on.

1914
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,680
Really going to be great.

1915
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:57,800
Really going to be great.

1916
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:58,300
Yeah.

1917
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,960
Alex hasn't got the memo from Trump's lawyer tweeting about Epstein being still alive, too.

1918
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:05,720
What's going on here?

1919
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:06,520
Oh, God.

1920
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:09,720
Anyway, I'm going to cut out this whole part, too.

1921
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:13,640
I just, I have no patience for it right now, and it's not important.

1922
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:15,240
I can just tell you what happened.

1923
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:15,740
Okay.

1924
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:20,760
Ivan Reichlin, the guy who hung out with Michael Flynn Jr. at the CPAC meeting.

1925
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1926
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:25,000
And apparently was working with some kind of a search engine startup.

1927
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:25,720
Hey, they're great.

1928
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,240
Very confusing stuff.

1929
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:33,480
He is on, and his argument for Alex is that Trump needs to immediately take over the emergency alert system.

1930
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,000
Okay, that'll do it.

1931
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,600
Then we'll all understand.

1932
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:45,640
And he needs to start, I guess, like broadcasting to people and explaining like the election was stolen over their phones or something.

1933
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:54,440
It's unclear the specifics of what they want Trump to do, but it involves taking over technology in a way that's like usually just for tornadoes.

1934
01:37:54,440 --> 01:38:00,520
You know, judging by the number of times it came up in cartoons when I was growing up,

1935
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:06,360
I assumed you would be able to solve most anti-reality problems with a frying pan to the side of the head.

1936
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:09,560
You know? Like, if this happened, if somebody says something like that.

1937
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:10,760
It'll get you back into reality.

1938
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,920
Yeah, it'll get hit him with a frying pan and all of a sudden he's like,

1939
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:14,680
whoo, good thing I don't think that shit anymore.

1940
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:15,720
Ooh, sorry about that.

1941
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:16,280
My bad.

1942
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:16,780
Yeah.

1943
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:17,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1944
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:18,520
Uh, yeah.

1945
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:22,200
I don't know if I can endorse a frying pan, but I would like-

1946
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,680
Only if it brings people back into reality.

1947
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:25,800
Well, I got-

1948
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:26,520
A magical frying pan.

1949
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:27,480
I need to ask you this, though.

1950
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:28,200
Sure, sure.

1951
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:31,880
I got the sense that this had something to do with Wonder Woman.

1952
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:32,520
Yes.

1953
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:33,020
Does it?

1954
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:34,140
No.

1955
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:35,800
The lasso of truth?

1956
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,480
No, the plot of the movie.

1957
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:37,980
Oh.

1958
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:42,600
Like, the electronic alert system idea, there was-

1959
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,360
Yeah, I guess that might be the case.

1960
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:45,000
There was something-

1961
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,720
I can see that.

1962
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:48,280
I don't know, like I said, I haven't seen the movie.

1963
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:51,720
It felt like Alex was hinting at having some connection to Wonder Woman.

1964
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:52,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1965
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:55,160
There was a presidential, like,

1966
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:59,800
we can control and broadcast into every home using this new technology.

1967
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:00,200
Bingo.

1968
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:00,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1969
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:01,080
That's it.

1970
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:01,560
Yep.

1971
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:02,600
Okay. Yep, it is.

1972
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:03,000
There you go.

1973
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:03,640
It's from the movie.

1974
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:09,080
Yeah, I honestly, I forgot about that part because I don't remember too much of them.

1975
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:13,400
Anyway, Ivan Reikland wants Alex to get Trump to use that.

1976
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:14,920
Okay, all right.

1977
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:17,960
The super secret magical broadcast into everybody's home.

1978
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:19,960
Yes, to save America.

1979
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:22,200
We gotta stop letting these people watch movies.

1980
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,080
Yeah, it would be good.

1981
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:25,240
All they get to read is Heart of Darkness.

1982
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:25,880
That's it.

1983
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:29,560
Alex, you can't come back to the Alamo Drafthouse.

1984
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:33,640
Yeah, you have to wake up every morning to Colonel Kurtz, he dead.

1985
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:34,600
That's what you gotta do.

1986
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,520
Mr. Kurtz, sorry.

1987
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:41,800
We'll jump ahead to this, to Rittenhouse's mom coming in.

1988
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:42,200
Sure.

1989
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:46,520
Because we've heard Ivan Reikland before, and basically his interview is no more interesting

1990
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:49,720
than Trump should use the emergency alert system to fuck with people.

1991
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:50,600
That'd be great.

1992
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:51,160
It wouldn't.

1993
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,280
It would be dark.

1994
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:54,780
Yeah.

1995
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:58,620
Yeah, what if War of the Worlds was the president and also real?

1996
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:02,300
God, it'd be awful.

1997
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:03,260
That'd be a nightmare.

1998
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:08,300
So I feel okay skipping that, because I find myself uninspired by it at the moment.

1999
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:14,620
I'm uninspired by Kyle Rittenhouse's mom as well, but it seems like something that bears

2000
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:15,660
discussion.

2001
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:19,580
Alex is really trying to turn Kyle Rittenhouse into a folk hero.

2002
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:27,580
We've watched the left burn down apartment buildings and police stations and shoot innocent

2003
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:29,180
people in the head on the side of the road.

2004
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:33,660
And we've watched the media tell us that it's mostly peaceful demonstrations.

2005
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:35,500
And then we saw Kyle Rittenhouse.

2006
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:36,140
Murder people.

2007
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:39,420
Who's become a symbol of good people defending themselves.

2008
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:40,380
A murderer.

2009
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:42,940
Out there trying to be a medic, trying to help people.

2010
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:43,740
Murdering people.

2011
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:45,100
In Kenosha, Wisconsin.

2012
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:45,740
He's a murderer.

2013
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:47,820
Being chased down by thugs with guns.

2014
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:49,260
Oh, he's a white supremacist murderer.

2015
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:49,660
I forgot about that.

2016
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:50,620
And defending himself.

2017
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:51,740
Murder?

2018
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:53,740
And now having the book thrown at him.

2019
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:54,940
Because he's a murderer.

2020
01:40:54,940 --> 01:41:01,740
I couldn't tell if this interview was prompted by the state tacking on a breaking curfew

2021
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:06,060
charge, which I even thought was a little like, that's suspicious.

2022
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:06,940
That's a little petty.

2023
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:10,300
There's got to be a reason, but I can't figure out what it is.

2024
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:16,380
So they can treat him very nicely and then throw the book at him on that breaking curfew

2025
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:16,940
charge.

2026
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:18,220
I'm not entirely sure.

2027
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:21,180
But I was listening to this and I'm like, I'm going to get mad.

2028
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:22,460
I don't like this.

2029
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:24,700
But then I realized I'm not going to get mad.

2030
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:27,180
I'm going to feel really sad for these people.

2031
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:29,900
I mean, look, no, I don't.

2032
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:32,060
But at the same time, I feel gross.

2033
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:33,020
Maybe that's what I feel.

2034
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:33,340
All right.

2035
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:33,900
I'm not sure.

2036
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:35,020
Let's talk to my therapist.

2037
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:36,140
Figure out exactly what I feel about this.

2038
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:37,260
Let's find out.

2039
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:38,620
We need more help, Alex.

2040
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:41,340
We need everyone to go to FreeKyleUSA.com.

2041
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:47,980
Kyle was subjected to an outrageous, excessive, unconstitutional $2 million cash bail amount.

2042
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:49,260
We raised those $2 million.

2043
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:50,540
We put the cash on the barrelhead.

2044
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:51,580
We got him free.

2045
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:52,380
We set him free.

2046
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:53,420
He's with his family.

2047
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:55,820
But we need a lot more resources.

2048
01:41:55,820 --> 01:41:58,620
This is going to be a long, hard fight.

2049
01:41:58,620 --> 01:42:02,220
Every American, every Democrat, Republican, independent should care about this because

2050
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:05,500
they're coming after Kyle Rittenhouse now and they're going to come after you next.

2051
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:08,220
Let's be clear about that.

2052
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:12,860
They pick people like Rittenhouse, like Stone, like Jones, like Trump, because I've experienced

2053
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:13,180
it.

2054
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:14,140
I'm not being a victim here.

2055
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:14,780
It's just true.

2056
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:18,140
And then we become like a standard, like the flag that they want to get.

2057
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:22,140
And then they throw everything they've got at you, the harassment, the lawsuits, the

2058
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:22,540
lies.

2059
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:28,780
I mean, like, nothing would be happening to Alex if he didn't commit, like, violations

2060
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:29,420
against people.

2061
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:29,980
Yeah, yeah.

2062
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:35,900
Like, if he didn't defame people, then he wouldn't be getting sued for those things.

2063
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:42,700
If Kyle Rittenhouse hadn't shot people, or even been at this protest with a gun that

2064
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:47,580
he shouldn't legally have had, like, there's a number of issues that, you know, like, it's

2065
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:52,380
not like globalists want to just turn people into symbols or whatever.

2066
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:58,860
There's actions that precede those lawsuits or arrests that generally are what cause them.

2067
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:04,460
These fuckers cheer when a black person gets 10 years for weed.

2068
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:06,380
Fuck them.

2069
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:13,580
I, like, any sympathy that I had where I was like, you know what, it was her son who did

2070
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:14,140
it.

2071
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:16,300
She's not directly involved with that.

2072
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:17,660
I'm not going to blame the mother.

2073
01:43:17,660 --> 01:43:19,500
You know, maybe parenting is an issue.

2074
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:20,220
I don't know.

2075
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:21,500
I don't know them personally.

2076
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:22,300
Infowars.

2077
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:24,860
Now that is all fucking gone.

2078
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:25,980
Go fuck yourself.

2079
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:27,100
You're a murderer too.

2080
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:28,140
I don't give a shit.

2081
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:32,060
But also this, like, this entire appearance is really just about raising money.

2082
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:32,620
Yeah, it's disgusting.

2083
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:35,980
They're constantly going back to the well of like, we need more money.

2084
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:36,300
Yeah.

2085
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:37,980
But Alex wants some content.

2086
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:40,780
He doesn't want her just, like, putting out this message.

2087
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:42,620
You get money for content.

2088
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:44,060
You understand the job here.

2089
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:45,820
Tell me how bad the left is.

2090
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:47,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2091
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:50,460
Has this been a new experience for you to really find out what the left's really like?

2092
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:53,340
They don't like to be murdered.

2093
01:43:53,340 --> 01:44:03,660
I mean, the left is disgusting, unreal, and you have to be a criminal for them to put

2094
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:04,860
you on a pedestal.

2095
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:06,220
My son.

2096
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:07,260
No, your son's a murderer.

2097
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:09,180
He's a caring young man.

2098
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:10,940
And no, he's not.

2099
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:13,660
They utilize him.

2100
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:17,740
Then he's a monster, a killer, a murderer.

2101
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:18,220
Yeah, he is.

2102
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:25,580
You know, it's just, I'm just so disgusted with it.

2103
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:27,820
You know, they need to be stopped.

2104
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:33,260
The internal logic here doesn't work because if the left has turned her son into a criminal

2105
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:37,180
and a murderer, then they should be putting him on a pedestal based on her saying that

2106
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:39,340
they take criminals and put them on pedestals.

2107
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:39,840
Yes.

2108
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:41,100
Doesn't make sense.

2109
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:42,540
No, no.

2110
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:45,740
And we, the left, needs to be stopped.

2111
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:49,180
Otherwise, Kyle Rittenhouse will continue murdering us.

2112
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:52,540
Hey, look, I just...

2113
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:54,000
Fuck them.

2114
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:56,140
That's, fuck you.

2115
01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:56,860
I agree.

2116
01:44:56,860 --> 01:45:00,860
That's, if you want to say that to me, cool.

2117
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:02,700
I will let you finish your statement.

2118
01:45:02,700 --> 01:45:04,140
And then I will say, go fuck yourself.

2119
01:45:04,140 --> 01:45:05,580
What if somebody wants to say this?

2120
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:08,540
New website and everything like that.

2121
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:15,660
We're selling merchandise from t-shirts, the mugs, I know I'm going to say it, bikinis.

2122
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:17,120
Yes.

2123
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:23,420
And a lot of people are disgusted by it, but you know what?

2124
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:25,420
I don't care.

2125
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:26,620
Yeah, I got that vibe.

2126
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:28,700
I got that vibe pretty strong.

2127
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:34,460
I'm interested to read Kyle's book, If I Did It, Here's How I Would Have Done It.

2128
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:39,660
Does he get to keep the profits from all of those sales?

2129
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:44,140
I mean, let's imagine a best case scenario for the rest of his life.

2130
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:44,640
Yeah.

2131
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:46,620
Like, just after that night.

2132
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:49,180
This is not part of it.

2133
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:52,460
Your mom selling Kyle Rittenhouse bikinis?

2134
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:52,960
Yep.

2135
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:57,260
Like, just even, like, take that night in Kenosha out of the equation.

2136
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:59,820
Imagine your mom selling a bikini with your face on it.

2137
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:00,460
Jesus.

2138
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:01,660
That would be years of therapy.

2139
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:02,540
That'd be great.

2140
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:03,500
That'd be really great.

2141
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:05,500
That'd be real great.

2142
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:06,700
It seems gross.

2143
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:09,440
Jesus.

2144
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:12,140
Not because it's a bikini.

2145
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:15,740
I mean, it's just crass, you know?

2146
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:17,340
Like, it's exploitative.

2147
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:24,940
Yeah, it's like in Peaky Blinders, whenever the one kid goes to jail and his mom winds

2148
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:31,820
up sleeping with the corrupt, evil Northern Irish police chief to get him out, and he's

2149
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:34,380
like, Mom, what did you do?

2150
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:35,660
What did you do?

2151
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:40,540
That's infinitely better than if you find out your mom sold your face on a bikini.

2152
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:43,740
I refuse to believe that Peaky Blinders exists.

2153
01:46:43,740 --> 01:46:44,940
I think it's just a funny name.

2154
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:45,740
Fantastic.

2155
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:46,940
It's a great show.

2156
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:48,300
Cillian Murphy is the best.

2157
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:52,460
I got this vibe off his mom that really worried me.

2158
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:56,380
You know, like, laughing about selling bikinis and then getting a little defensive about

2159
01:46:56,380 --> 01:46:56,540
it.

2160
01:46:56,540 --> 01:46:57,020
Yeah.

2161
01:46:57,020 --> 01:46:57,820
Like, all right.

2162
01:46:57,820 --> 01:46:58,380
All right, Ma.

2163
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:03,580
And then the lawyer comes in and says this, and I got even worse vibes off this dude.

2164
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:08,300
There has been a long march through the institutions over the past few decades.

2165
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:13,580
It's very similar to the Maoist revolution in China and the Chinese Communist Party.

2166
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:14,860
Their tactics are very clear.

2167
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:17,580
They attempt to destroy everything sacred in a society.

2168
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:19,900
They attempt to tear down statues.

2169
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:21,900
They try to destroy history.

2170
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:27,500
They try to destroy our faith in God, and they try to capture the key cultural elite

2171
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:34,540
institutions such as the media, such as academia, such as the financial institutions, and today

2172
01:47:34,540 --> 01:47:35,580
such as big tech.

2173
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:38,860
And they've been pretty successful on that front.

2174
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:43,100
But I'll tell you, Americans are waking up now, and we're going to fight back, and it's

2175
01:47:43,100 --> 01:47:46,140
not going to be pretty for those who are attempting to take our freedom.

2176
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:49,100
Well, all I can say is amen to that.

2177
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:51,260
We got one more segment with you guys coming up.

2178
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:54,940
I don't like the idea that this guy thinks there's a decades-long communist party who

2179
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:56,380
might not be the best representation.

2180
01:47:56,860 --> 01:48:00,060
Also, I would guess that I would say, are you a lawyer?

2181
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:11,660
This is like when you're 17, and when you go to college, you need to get a good humanities

2182
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:15,020
education, and then you can kind of start getting into your specialty, and you're all

2183
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:16,300
like, nah, I don't need...

2184
01:48:16,300 --> 01:48:18,060
What is all this humanities bullshit?

2185
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:20,780
My major is pre-law or whatever.

2186
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:23,900
And it's like, this is why you need a humanities education.

2187
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:27,500
This is why you need to read anything other than law.

2188
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:28,620
I have to make a confession.

2189
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:29,100
What's that?

2190
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:34,460
I didn't actually watch this video, so I can't confirm if this guy is not a robot.

2191
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:34,940
Oh, okay.

2192
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:41,100
It's entirely possible he is just animated on screen.

2193
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:41,900
It's Wall-E.

2194
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:43,500
Yeah, it's an AI lawyer.

2195
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:46,140
It's one of those machines.

2196
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:50,940
Such as big tech, such as media, such as banks.

2197
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:52,860
Like when an AI writes a screenplay.

2198
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:55,900
An AI writes a right-wing screed.

2199
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:57,260
It's the same thing.

2200
01:48:57,260 --> 01:48:58,060
Oh boy.

2201
01:48:58,060 --> 01:49:00,460
So Alex is like, hey, I got a great idea.

2202
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:01,500
You should work with Barnes.

2203
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:04,460
Yeah, he breathes really heavy.

2204
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:05,500
You're a robot.

2205
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:11,260
No, his idea is like, I don't like these pardons that Trump is throwing around.

2206
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:11,900
Yes, they're evil.

2207
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:15,500
But maybe pardon could be used for Kyle Rittenhouse.

2208
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:16,380
Oh boy.

2209
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:17,180
That would be...

2210
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:19,900
This kind of reveals that Alex doesn't understand how pardons work.

2211
01:49:20,540 --> 01:49:25,100
Can the president pardon Rittenhouse before he's convicted?

2212
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:26,540
And obviously he didn't do anything wrong.

2213
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:27,420
The law's on his side.

2214
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:28,700
It's going to be a big fight.

2215
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:29,500
They're being political.

2216
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:30,220
They're not dropping it.

2217
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:35,980
But just hypothetically, could President Trump preemptively pardon Kyle Rittenhouse?

2218
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:42,620
So Alex, the president's pardoning authorities under the Constitution only

2219
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:45,580
offend to charges under federal law.

2220
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:48,300
These are charges under state law in Wisconsin.

2221
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:53,500
So we are going to need to take this fight to the front lines in Wisconsin.

2222
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:54,060
Yep.

2223
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:54,560
Yeah.

2224
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:55,900
So no.

2225
01:49:57,260 --> 01:50:03,580
Also, any political system where you think it's a good idea to be able to write get out

2226
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:09,260
of jail free cards, like one free murder cards preemptively, that's a bad system.

2227
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:09,980
Yeah, no shit.

2228
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:11,340
You should not support that system.

2229
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:13,900
Even imagining that system is not good.

2230
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:14,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2231
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:15,840
No.

2232
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:18,140
So anyway, fuck all these people.

2233
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:19,980
I'm not going to listen to any more of their interview.

2234
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:21,180
It's not really that interesting.

2235
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:25,420
It's just kind of like Alex begging for Kyle to come on once he can talk.

2236
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:29,260
Once he can speak publicly like, I gotta get this guy a job.

2237
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:29,740
Wow.

2238
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:31,100
Might as well be what he's saying.

2239
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:31,740
Yeah.

2240
01:50:31,740 --> 01:50:35,180
Anyway, Alex has a little bit of time left to kill here at the end of the show.

2241
01:50:36,780 --> 01:50:38,140
No more Wonder Woman thoughts.

2242
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:41,180
Hmm, although he does get to talk about Bill Gates.

2243
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:42,300
It turns out Bill Gates.

2244
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:43,520
Demon.

2245
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:44,460
Yeah.

2246
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:45,260
Super demon.

2247
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:45,760
Sure.

2248
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:47,900
Genetic super demon.

2249
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:49,180
I did not know that.

2250
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:52,860
Now, when you look at Bill Gates, that is a literal super demon.

2251
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:55,020
A literal super killing machine.

2252
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:57,020
So is he back in the 12th?

2253
01:50:57,020 --> 01:51:01,180
Celebrations on TV, which with a psycho is what they love to do.

2254
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:04,220
So many psychos like send letters to the police.

2255
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:05,020
You'll never catch me.

2256
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:06,060
You'll never get me.

2257
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:10,220
Or they'll even tell you what they're going to do to you before they do it.

2258
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:14,860
And they just hate everyone.

2259
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:19,180
And it's like a kid pulling the legs off a frog or something, except they do it to people

2260
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:20,060
in mash.

2261
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:21,740
And of course, a lot of times it's genetic.

2262
01:51:22,540 --> 01:51:26,140
You know, his dad was clearly a genetic psychotic.

2263
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:26,640
Oh boy.

2264
01:51:27,660 --> 01:51:29,660
Mark Zuckerberg is a genetic psychopath.

2265
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:30,460
Oh boy.

2266
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:34,460
And boy, when I call him a genetic psychopath is he obviously knows, you know, that you

2267
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:37,020
can look at him and see he's got the chromosome disorder.

2268
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:37,660
What?

2269
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:38,300
Several of them.

2270
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:39,420
He's definitely got the disorder.

2271
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:42,060
He got so pissed.

2272
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:45,020
He said the last straw was Jones calling me a genetic psychopath.

2273
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:51,580
Because that was the protege, the aide, the camp, the apprentice of Bill Gates is right.

2274
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:53,500
I mean, you know, it's Mark Zuckerberg.

2275
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:54,380
I mean, they're on record.

2276
01:51:54,380 --> 01:51:55,420
They vacation together.

2277
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:56,780
They both wear pink sweaters.

2278
01:51:56,780 --> 01:51:58,380
They both wear pink sweaters.

2279
01:51:58,380 --> 01:51:59,500
What more do you need to know?

2280
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:02,780
I hate this so much.

2281
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:06,060
I hate you so much.

2282
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:11,420
I really don't like the idea that Alex has decided that there's a psychopath gene that's

2283
01:52:11,420 --> 01:52:15,500
inheritable among generations and that he can see visually.

2284
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:16,620
Yeah, yeah.

2285
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:17,980
I really don't like that.

2286
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:21,100
You know what's great to hear in 2020?

2287
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:21,980
Phrenology.

2288
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:22,300
Yeah.

2289
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:23,420
That's what you want to hear.

2290
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:29,180
Yeah, what's really great is magic.

2291
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:35,180
A lot of people who believe really heavily that things should be talked about in almost

2292
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:38,700
exclusively genetic terms are cool folks.

2293
01:52:38,700 --> 01:52:39,100
Yeah.

2294
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:40,140
Yeah, they're super cool.

2295
01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:41,340
Yeah, typically, chill is out.

2296
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:42,380
Love them.

2297
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:46,700
So you have one last clip here, and I hate to disappoint, but this is actually a perfect

2298
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:47,820
last clip for Alex.

2299
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:52,060
Paul Watson has a lot to cover.

2300
01:52:52,060 --> 01:52:58,460
I only scratched the surface here of the big enchilada today.

2301
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:02,860
I didn't get to it, and I can't really do justice to this.

2302
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:03,820
We have them now.

2303
01:53:03,820 --> 01:53:04,700
Now's the time I have.

2304
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:08,780
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to shoot a special report right after I'm not live.

2305
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:09,740
We have them now.

2306
01:53:10,620 --> 01:53:11,820
I'm going to take a five minute break.

2307
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:12,320
Now.

2308
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:14,300
And have a nice glass of water.

2309
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:21,420
And then I'm going to go and I'm going to shoot a whole report on this latest event.

2310
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:22,540
This latest development.

2311
01:53:22,540 --> 01:53:23,340
Great.

2312
01:53:23,340 --> 01:53:27,020
Where you saw a few months ago, they got the Canadian document about the next lockdowns

2313
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:28,620
coming and then there'll be the strain too.

2314
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:32,300
And then we'll never unlock things until the communist takeover happens.

2315
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:33,420
People said, Is this real?

2316
01:53:34,060 --> 01:53:34,560
Yes.

2317
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:36,700
Look, Alex didn't have time to cover this.

2318
01:53:36,700 --> 01:53:37,900
I don't have time for it either.

2319
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:39,660
We'll see what happens in the next episode.

2320
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:40,940
I fucking hate you.

2321
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:43,180
I hate this so much.

2322
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:45,100
We've got you now.

2323
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:47,740
Now is when we've got you.

2324
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:51,580
And right now I'm going to take care after we get to a couple of different things, listen.

2325
01:53:51,580 --> 01:53:55,900
Look, I got to talk to Ivan Reiklin about how Trump needs to start using tornado alerts

2326
01:53:55,900 --> 01:53:56,860
to take over the country.

2327
01:53:56,860 --> 01:53:57,900
That's how we're going to do it.

2328
01:53:58,620 --> 01:54:00,060
You got to get the message to the people.

2329
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:04,700
The problem with America, Dan, is not enough people have heard Trump speak.

2330
01:54:04,700 --> 01:54:07,580
That's the real issue that I think we've all had.

2331
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:09,500
He's just not getting his fair day in court.

2332
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:10,780
He's not getting his word out.

2333
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:15,420
Well, because the courts keep reading the petitions and being like, Oh, no, this is

2334
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:16,380
comically stupid.

2335
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:20,300
Yeah, reading is one of their big hang ups when it comes to writing.

2336
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:20,940
Yeah.

2337
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:25,580
So I think we have a pretty good start to the end of the year for Alex here.

2338
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:27,580
Wonder Woman sucks.

2339
01:54:27,580 --> 01:54:28,080
Yep.

2340
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:37,100
Some harder COVID denialism, particularly around the like the 77 people, like that glaring

2341
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:40,140
misunderstanding of the data and the weaponization of it.

2342
01:54:40,140 --> 01:54:40,640
Yeah.

2343
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:47,840
Um, uh, I, I, I feel, I feel unglued, um, listening to this.

2344
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:52,000
Like I want to know, like there's no continuity.

2345
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,040
Right, right, right.

2346
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:54,400
It's just all over the place.

2347
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:54,720
Yeah.

2348
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:55,120
Yeah.

2349
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:55,760
It's everywhere.

2350
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:56,240
Yeah.

2351
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:59,920
Anyway, what happened to the, like, there's no follow up on the Nashville.

2352
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:00,560
We have it.

2353
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:01,440
We have them now.

2354
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:02,800
You don't need to worry about it.

2355
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:08,640
What you need to worry about, Dan, is which of the Hollywood Chris's are you a fan of?

2356
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:10,800
Cause listen, I hate Chris Pine.

2357
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,320
I'm going to say it right now.

2358
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:13,760
I watched Wonder Woman.

2359
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:14,960
I hate Chris Pine.

2360
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:15,520
What about Evans?

2361
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:16,160
What about Evans?

2362
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,120
Captain America?

2363
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,080
I can't support that.

2364
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:19,520
All cops are bad.

2365
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:19,840
All right.

2366
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:20,400
What next?

2367
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:22,480
Uh, Chris Hardwick.

2368
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:23,200
Chris Hardwick?

2369
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:24,880
Oh no, definitely a big no on that one.

2370
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:27,680
Gonna go with a big pass, a Rooney on that.

2371
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:29,360
What was the name I was trying to pull out?

2372
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:31,680
The guy from Parks and Rec.

2373
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:33,600
Chris, uh, uh, oh.

2374
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:36,080
Oh, now I can't remember.

2375
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:37,680
Wait, no, the character's name was Chris.

2376
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:38,160
Is that right?

2377
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:38,800
Yeah, yeah.

2378
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,080
I think that was Rob Lowe?

2379
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:40,240
No.

2380
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:41,440
Is that what you're talking about?

2381
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:43,600
I'm thinking of the guy from Jurassic Park.

2382
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:44,640
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2383
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:45,280
Oh, he sucks too.

2384
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:45,920
Chris Pratt.

2385
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:46,640
Yeah, Chris Pratt.

2386
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:47,920
He's a, he's a lunatic.

2387
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:48,480
He sucks.

2388
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:49,840
Yeah.

2389
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:50,560
Which is the other one?

2390
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:51,360
Chris Hemsworth.

2391
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:52,640
Who's Chris Hemsworth?

2392
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:53,120
Thor?

2393
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:54,320
Or Thor's brother?

2394
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:55,040
Love Thor.

2395
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:55,440
Okay.

2396
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:55,920
Love Thor.

2397
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:57,200
That's my favorite Chris.

2398
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:57,680
Done.

2399
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:58,160
Great.

2400
01:55:58,160 --> 01:55:58,800
What about you?

2401
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,320
I don't know, man.

2402
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:01,040
Maybe all Chris's.

2403
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:03,840
Except for our conspiracy of Chris's.

2404
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:04,320
That's true.

2405
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:06,800
The wonderful Chris's that are in the Wonk nation.

2406
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:08,160
That's what I choose.

2407
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:08,480
Yep.

2408
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:09,440
You're stars to me.

2409
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:11,920
I love it.

2410
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:17,120
So we'll be back on our next episode on Monday to check in and see how Alex closes out the

2411
01:56:17,120 --> 01:56:19,040
disastrous year that was 2020.

2412
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:19,760
Gotta get rid of it.

2413
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:24,720
And then, you know, we'll be into smoother sailing or not.

2414
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:25,360
Probably not.

2415
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:25,920
We'll see.

2416
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:26,240
Yep.

2417
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,120
We'll see.

2418
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:30,640
But happy new year to you and yours if you celebrate the Gregorians.

2419
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:30,960
Yep.

2420
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:35,120
If you're a Gregorian-ers, then yeah, happy new year to you.

2421
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:35,680
And we'll be back.

2422
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:36,880
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

2423
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:37,600
We do have a website.

2424
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:38,960
It's knowledgefight.com.

2425
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,000
So we're also on Twitter.

2426
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:40,640
We are on Twitter.

2427
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:42,960
It's at knowledgefight.com and at go2bedjordan.

2428
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:43,120
Yep.

2429
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:44,000
We're also on Facebook.

2430
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:44,880
We are on Facebook.

2431
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:50,080
If you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out those

2432
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:50,880
doing God's work.

2433
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:51,040
Yep.

2434
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:51,440
We'll be back.

2435
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:52,640
But until then, I'm Neo.

2436
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:53,120
I'm Leo.

2437
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,400
I'm DZX clerk.

2438
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:55,440
I'm Daryl Rundis.

2439
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:57,120
I live on the edge, man.

2440
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:59,360
I live 45 minutes from town.

2441
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:01,040
Andy in Kansas.

2442
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:01,520
You're on the air.

2443
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:02,160
Thanks for holding.

2444
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:04,800
Hello, Alex.

2445
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:05,760
I'm a first time caller.

2446
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:06,560
I'm a huge fan.

2447
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:07,360
I love your work.

2448
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:35,120
I love you.
