N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am sweating.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
Knowledgefight, I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
Knowledgefight.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Dan and Jordan.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Knowledgefight.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
I need, I need money.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Andy in Kansas.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Andy in, Andy in.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Stop it.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Andy in, Andy in Kansas.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Andy in, Andy in.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
It's time to pray.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Andy in Kansas.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
You're on the air.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Thanks for holding.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Hello, Alex.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm a first time caller.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
I'm a huge fan.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
I love your room.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Knowledgefight.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
N-N-N-N-N-Knowledgefight.com.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I love you.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Hey, everybody.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Welcome back to Knowledgefight.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm Dan.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm Jordan.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
This is not 2020.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
No, it is not.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Yes.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Happy New Year.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
It is no longer here.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
All the fine folks out there.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Welcome one and all to a brand new year.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Same old shit though, but it's a brand new year.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Good riddance to old rubbish.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
See y'all in hell.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
What I'll say about 2020.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Hey, bye.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Hey, this is a podcast where we like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
a little bit about Alex Jones.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
I'm Dan.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Indeed we do.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
I'm Jordan.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Have we said that already?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
I don't know.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
I threw off our rhythm.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
We're starting off with it a new way.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Cut.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
No.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Yeah, here we are.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Happy New Year.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Dan.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Yes.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Dan.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Jordan.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Quick question.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
What's your bright spot, buddy?

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
My bright spot is actually going to have to wait until the shout outs to donors section

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
of the podcast, and you'll enjoy it then.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
All right.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
But for now, I shall turn the question around on you.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
What is yours?

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Dan, my bright spot is my two lovely dogs.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
They're very cute.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
I enjoy-

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I begrudgingly say.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
My new favorite pastime now is catching them in some sort of pose, taking a picture, and

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
then marking it up on my phone, and just drawing a fanciful little picture around it.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
It is my favorite thing to do.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
You've got to get those dogs on TikTok.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
What is TikTok?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Teach them dances.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
But what is TikTok?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I don't know.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah, me neither, man.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Too old.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
It's not for us.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
No.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
It's not for us.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
We would just ruin it if we were there.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Get those dogs on Snapchat.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Is Snapchat still a thing?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
I don't know.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Never been on it.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
I have no idea.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Me neither.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Oh, God.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
We're so old.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Get them on Vine.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Ah, Vine.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
That's where I'm going to go.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Is Quibi still available?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I think I got a five-pitch deal with them.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Get them a Quibi.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Get them a Quibi.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Yeah.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.520
I'll put them on Cameo and see what they have to say.

02:52.520 --> 02:56.640
I think you run into ethical issues there.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.280
I don't think that it's ethical.

02:58.280 --> 03:01.120
Are there labor laws for dogs?

03:01.120 --> 03:07.360
I do think that based on your politics, you should not exploit the labor of those dogs.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.360
That's fair.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.360
That's fair.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.960
I got to get twin dogs so they only have to work four hours at a time, each of them.

03:12.960 --> 03:18.000
If you redirected the money from the Cameos towards all dog-related treats, then maybe.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.680
It may be, but it's still dicey territory.

03:20.680 --> 03:24.080
Otherwise we're in child star territory there.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.080
Well, that is a fine, bright spot, Jordan.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.080
They're my favorites.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.040
I'm glad you're having fun with those dogs.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.040
Delightful.

03:31.040 --> 03:35.760
So today, Jordan, what we have in front of us is the first episode of 2021.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.320
Yay.

03:37.320 --> 03:40.160
And we're still in 2020 for this episode.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.160
Well, yeah.

03:41.160 --> 03:45.240
But we're going to go over December 28th and 29th.

03:45.240 --> 03:49.200
That's Monday and Tuesday of last week, or I guess this week.

03:49.200 --> 03:54.280
And that way we save the end of the year for Monday.

03:54.280 --> 04:01.520
And then also it'll be in the lead up to Alex's going to Washington, DC on the 6th.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.520
That's right.

04:02.520 --> 04:03.520
They're still doing that.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.680
So next week, there's a plan to go to DC for all that.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.680
Wild.

04:07.680 --> 04:08.680
So I figure we can-

04:08.680 --> 04:09.680
Third time's the charm, I guess.

04:09.680 --> 04:14.800
We can close out 2020, see how Alex ended the year on Monday, and then check in on the

04:14.800 --> 04:17.280
aftermath of that rally on Friday.

04:17.280 --> 04:18.280
It'll be great.

04:18.280 --> 04:19.280
And have a blast.

04:19.280 --> 04:22.080
It'll be a real bummer if they win.

04:22.080 --> 04:24.320
It'll be a bad rally for us.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.680
It'll be a bad rally no matter what, I think.

04:26.680 --> 04:27.680
That's fair.

04:27.680 --> 04:28.680
That's fair.

04:28.680 --> 04:32.940
So Jordan, before we get into this episode, a little bit of an extended, we have a number

04:32.940 --> 04:35.900
of shout outs today, which is very exciting.

04:35.900 --> 04:39.440
Some of this is for folks who have signed up and are supporting the show, which we very

04:39.440 --> 04:40.440
much appreciate.

04:40.440 --> 04:43.040
And some, one of them is a bright spot.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.040
Okay.

04:44.040 --> 04:48.520
So first, this is not a bright spot.

04:48.520 --> 04:52.720
I am saying this name with a gun to my head, metaphorically.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.280
This is a dark spot.

04:54.280 --> 04:57.980
Alex Jones' too-messant, moist penis.

04:57.980 --> 04:58.980
Thank you so much.

04:58.980 --> 04:59.980
You are now a policy wonk.

04:59.980 --> 05:00.980
I'm a policy wonk.

05:00.980 --> 05:02.480
I didn't want to say that.

05:02.480 --> 05:03.480
Yeah.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.480
Yeah.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.480
Yeah.

05:05.480 --> 05:06.480
Yeah.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.480
Yeah.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.940
We do have, there are some flaws in our, we'll thank everybody plan.

05:08.940 --> 05:10.680
There are some flaws that can be exploited.

05:10.680 --> 05:11.680
Yep.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.340
Take that Jeffy or Jeffy, thank you so much.

05:14.340 --> 05:16.080
You are now policy wonk.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.580
I'm a policy wonk.

05:17.580 --> 05:18.660
Thank you very much.

05:18.660 --> 05:19.660
Thank you.

05:19.660 --> 05:20.660
Next.

05:20.660 --> 05:21.660
Frankie fresh.

05:21.660 --> 05:22.660
Thank you so much.

05:22.660 --> 05:23.660
You are now a policy wonk.

05:23.660 --> 05:24.660
I'm a policy wonk.

05:24.660 --> 05:25.660
Thank you very much.

05:25.660 --> 05:26.660
Frankie fresh, moist penis.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.660
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.660
Am I not supposed to do that?

05:28.660 --> 05:29.840
Oh, I apologize.

05:29.840 --> 05:30.840
Next.

05:30.840 --> 05:31.840
Puff Danny.

05:31.840 --> 05:32.840
Thank you so much.

05:32.840 --> 05:33.840
You are now policy wonk.

05:33.840 --> 05:34.840
I'm a policy wonk.

05:34.840 --> 05:35.840
Thank you.

05:35.840 --> 05:36.840
Next.

05:36.840 --> 05:37.840
Sammy.

05:37.840 --> 05:38.960
Thank you so much.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.600
You are now policy wonk.

05:40.600 --> 05:46.680
Thanks Sammy. Thank you. Next, don't go into the future. It's hot there. Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk.

05:46.680 --> 05:52.960
I'm a policy wonk. Thank you very much. Good advice for all of us. Sure. Yeah. Next, Nomad Adam. Thank you so much

05:52.960 --> 05:57.160
You're now a policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Thanks, Nomadum. Ooh. Aha!

05:57.880 --> 06:03.880
Combined him. Yeah. And finally, I'd like to say thank you to someone donated on an elevated level. We appreciate that very much

06:03.880 --> 06:09.800
This is very important. Cisco is reverse flash. Thank you so much. You are now a technocrat. I'm a policy wonk.

06:09.800 --> 06:14.480
Crikey, mate. That's fantastic. Have yourself a brew. How's your 401k doing, bro?

06:14.480 --> 06:18.480
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright? Let's just get down to business.

06:18.480 --> 06:24.040
We ain't making that money off that heroin. Why are you pimps so good? My neck is freakishly large.

06:24.040 --> 06:29.960
I declare info war on you. Thank you so much. Cisco is reverse flash. Yes, thank you very much.

06:29.960 --> 06:38.040
Jordan, we have a couple of special things here. Of course. First, gotta say a very special birthday

06:38.040 --> 06:44.600
shout out to Bjorn L. Okay, happy birthday. Thank you for listening to the show and shooting us a message.

06:44.600 --> 06:52.600
Yes. Also, happy anniversary. Getting married on the first, right? Getting married on the first? Craziness.

06:52.600 --> 06:57.240
Oh, that's out of control. I guess you'll never forget your anniversary if it's on the first.

06:57.240 --> 07:02.840
It's cheating. It's cheating. Come on, man. It's cheating. Nah, nah. Get married on the second.

07:02.840 --> 07:08.280
I still think that would be easy to remember. I honestly think it would probably be, I've not been married,

07:08.280 --> 07:13.240
but I think it would be probably, it's not as hard as like sitcoms make it seem to remember your anniversary.

07:13.240 --> 07:20.520
No, no, no. It's not that bad. Oh, no. Not again. That happened in every show. Yeah. Multiple times.

07:20.520 --> 07:25.640
Yeah, but it's still never going to beat out the going on two dates in the same restaurant. Sure.

07:25.640 --> 07:31.720
That's the best one there's ever been. That was a good gag. Every show for 20 years had one of those.

07:31.720 --> 07:39.720
It's fantastic. So, happy anniversary to Ryan and Anne Randomly. Oh, happy anniversary. Yeah, happy

07:39.720 --> 07:48.680
anniversary to you both. Yes, indeed. It would be weird to only wish one of you out. So, I insist on sending this message to both of you.

07:48.680 --> 07:53.720
Happy anniversary to one and get out of that relationship to the other. No, no, no. Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

07:53.720 --> 07:59.640
So now, here's my bright spot, Jordan. What's that? This is something that is going to blow minds from here to Scandinavia.

07:59.640 --> 08:07.560
Scandinavia. Yes. Scandinavian minds too. So, I got two messages in the past little bit

08:08.680 --> 08:15.160
from people who are trying to set up shout outs for their significant other. Sure. But unbeknownst

08:15.160 --> 08:22.440
to either of them, they have both messaged me. We did not O'Henry someone. We did not O'Henry.

08:22.440 --> 08:29.640
How dare you O'Henry us? Who are you? This is a coordinated attack. This was- We got O'Henry.

08:29.640 --> 08:36.440
Elizabeth from Sweden, Axel sent me a message to give you a shout out to say that you're a policy wonk.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.600
Axel from Sweden, Elizabeth sent me a message asking to give you a shout out and that you

08:42.600 --> 08:49.080
would go crazy. And you both, you must both shave your heads now. That is the rule. Both of you must

08:49.080 --> 08:54.840
shave your heads and buy each other combs. Let's go all the way in. I just found that to be-

08:54.840 --> 08:59.480
That's the most delightful thing that I can think of. Yeah, and I hope both of your minds are blown.

08:59.480 --> 09:03.880
Yeah, that's a bright spot for me too, Dan. Yeah, it's just- Fuck my dogs. I'm getting rid of them. I

09:03.880 --> 09:07.560
just want to think about this for the rest of my life. What a way to start the year. That is great.

09:07.560 --> 09:13.000
Yeah. That is great. It's wholesome. Super wholesome. I hope it's a nice surprise for them. Cute as shit.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.320
Yep. And Elizabeth from Sweden and Axel from Sweden, you're both policy wonks. I'm a policy wonk.

09:19.320 --> 09:23.960
Thank you both for brightening my week. Yes, thank you very much. It was great.

09:23.960 --> 09:29.560
I can't imagine listening to this. You would have to be really, really deep in it if you listen to

09:29.560 --> 09:36.440
that part of our show and we're like, no fun. No, I don't like it. My heart isn't warmed by that.

09:36.440 --> 09:43.160
I'm bitter as shit and I'm going to cry. I think some people just hit the 15 seconds ahead.

09:43.160 --> 09:49.560
None of this bullshit. Yeah, it's our version of ads. Yeah, yeah, basically. So, Jordan,

09:49.560 --> 09:54.600
like I said, December 28th and 29th. Yes, sir, Dan. Here we go. We're jumping in on Monday.

09:54.600 --> 10:01.800
All right. And this is where Alex is starting off. Start your engines, my friends. It's Monday,

10:01.800 --> 10:09.160
December 28th. The year is 2020. We have several very informative guests that are going to be

10:09.160 --> 10:15.240
joining us coming up today. Do we? And I'm going to lay out just exactly where we are on planet

10:15.240 --> 10:19.640
Earth in the fight against the globalist. Austin. But first, President Trump over the weekend

10:19.640 --> 10:26.600
tweeted out a very powerful video titled Man in America 2020 has been a year like no other.

10:26.600 --> 10:32.280
Here is that report. So this report that Alex is citing that Trump tweeted out is not what

10:32.280 --> 10:38.040
you would call a report. That term's being used real loosely. Okay. In reality, it's a video

10:38.040 --> 10:42.840
about how the election was stolen, created by a guy named Seth Holhouse, who runs a website

10:42.840 --> 10:47.720
called Man in America. I wanted to learn a little bit more about this guy. So I went to his website

10:47.720 --> 10:52.600
and I noticed a few things that I thought were interesting. Two big things popped up about his

10:52.600 --> 10:59.640
URL, which is mia.news. The first is that MIA stands for missing in action. So that kind of

10:59.640 --> 11:04.280
gives off the exact opposite vibe that this guy's probably hoping to put out there. It's time for

11:04.280 --> 11:10.760
all good patriots to show up. So please remember you can find me at MIA. I might've chosen a

11:10.760 --> 11:15.240
different name, different acronym. Like for instance, I might've gone with American

11:15.240 --> 11:21.000
withstanding outside legions. No problem with that one. That one's good. All right. The other

11:21.000 --> 11:25.880
thing that popped up was this guy had a dot news URL and pretty much the only people I've ever seen

11:25.880 --> 11:30.520
getting dot news pages are InfoWars associates. I'm sure some other people are doing it too,

11:30.520 --> 11:35.560
but it's become something I associate so much with Alex and his crew that I instinctually suspect

11:35.560 --> 11:43.720
something is not right if it has a dot news address. It might've been slightly unexpected

11:43.720 --> 11:48.600
that this video went as viral as it did after Trump tweeted it out because according to an

11:48.600 --> 11:53.960
article by Will Summer in the Daily Beast, some interesting things started to happen recently.

11:53.960 --> 11:59.240
In particular, it appears that references online to Whole House being a member of the Falun Gong

11:59.240 --> 12:05.320
movement began to be erased, including a mention of his appearance at a 2007 Minnesota conference

12:05.320 --> 12:10.840
on the website Clear Harmony and all mentions of him on MingHui.org. Why would they want that

12:10.840 --> 12:15.480
scrubbed? He also apparently, this has not necessarily been scrubbed from the internet,

12:15.480 --> 12:21.000
but he was employed by the Epoch Times, a right-wing media outlet associated with Falun Gong

12:21.000 --> 12:26.920
between 2008 and 2015, but he's apparently also freelanced as a photographer for them as recently

12:26.920 --> 12:31.320
as July of this year. Great, great. Good stuff. Everybody's got to work. Freelance is tough.

12:32.280 --> 12:36.600
This is not an individual who made a news report that's super powerful. It's the product of a

12:36.600 --> 12:43.240
longtime employee of a deeply right-wing propaganda media outlet that essentially deifies Trump.

12:43.240 --> 12:47.960
The removal of Whole House's name from those websites is kind of telling and the most likely

12:47.960 --> 12:52.520
explanation for why it happened is because the propaganda video featured him as the narrator

12:52.520 --> 12:57.160
and it doesn't work nearly as well as if you know that he's the member of a spiritual movement that

12:57.160 --> 13:01.640
reportedly views Trump as a critical ally in the coming judgment day where communists will be sent

13:01.640 --> 13:07.080
to hell. There is that. According to former Epoch Times employees speaking to the NBC News. There

13:07.080 --> 13:12.440
is that, yeah. That does kind of mess with your credibility a hair. Right, you like the presentation

13:12.440 --> 13:17.240
of the man in America. Just the American flag behind him. It's all just, you know. So it's less

13:17.240 --> 13:22.520
a media report and more a book report on Behold Apparel Horse. Yeah. The charade works better when

13:22.520 --> 13:27.640
you just believe that Whole House is what he presents himself to be. From his website to his

13:27.640 --> 13:32.840
bio, quote, born and raised in the countryside of Ohio, I never thought I would see a time when our

13:32.840 --> 13:37.800
freedoms were under attack like they are today. I spent the last 15 years fighting against the

13:37.800 --> 13:42.760
tyranny of communism in China, but never did I imagine that that fight would come to American

13:42.760 --> 13:47.880
soil. My heart beats with the blood of a patriot and I would rather die fighting than kneel down

13:47.880 --> 13:53.240
in shame. I created Man in America to speak to my fellow patriots and help educate, inspire,

13:53.240 --> 13:58.760
and unite us. All right, all I just heard was a lot of ravens like screeching in my ears,

13:58.760 --> 14:07.080
like that's all I heard was like, it's sort of an angry mix between Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Charlie

14:07.080 --> 14:13.160
Brown's teacher. Yeah, I've never written a good bio for myself, but I've always strayed about as

14:13.160 --> 14:18.680
far away from self-mythologizing as I possibly could. This kind of reminds me of that advertising

14:18.680 --> 14:24.120
dude who created the Frank Bates persona to sell survival food and prepper supplies to conservatives.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.960
Yeah. Because he knew that the pitch would sound more attractive coming from a normal everyday

14:27.960 --> 14:32.840
kind of fellow like Frank, even though he didn't exist, compared to the reality of it being a,

14:32.840 --> 14:36.680
you know, just bullshit being resold to them by an affiliate marketing billionaire who lives

14:36.680 --> 14:43.160
like in New York. It does not, yeah. It's a, it's a, it's a sort of puppet game. Yeah, it's a,

14:43.160 --> 14:48.520
it's tricking flyover states. Anyway, I bring this up to remind everyone that Alex Jones considers

14:48.520 --> 14:55.320
this a news report. What he's doing is just desperately chasing the actual new alternative

14:55.320 --> 15:02.120
propaganda media, folks with associations with like Epoch Times or OAN and Newsmax until like

15:02.120 --> 15:07.320
a week or two ago. And they admitted that Biden won the election. Also, it appears that Alex

15:07.320 --> 15:12.600
really didn't want to work on this episode because other than introducing that special report,

15:12.600 --> 15:16.600
he doesn't get back into the studio until 20 minutes into the episode. That's very fun.

15:16.600 --> 15:23.320
He just plays stuff. I appreciate that. Yeah. Have we definitively proven that Falun Gong is

15:23.320 --> 15:28.200
wrong though? Are they still, is it, are they still in the running for the end of day's winner?

15:28.200 --> 15:35.480
I don't know nearly enough about that as a group to speak with any kind of authority or credibility.

15:35.480 --> 15:43.720
Sure. But so I can't, I can't say, you know, like if, if like their point is solely that China is

15:43.720 --> 15:50.920
repressive of groups, I don't disagree with that point. Yeah. But I don't think that groups like

15:50.920 --> 15:56.440
the Epoch Times are on the up and up. Yeah. I was being facetious. I don't think all communists

15:56.440 --> 16:00.120
are going to go to hell. I just don't think that's going to end up happening in the next,

16:00.120 --> 16:04.760
I don't think, even if it does, I don't think Trump is your ally. Probably not. I would say

16:04.760 --> 16:08.840
he's not the one you want to go. I also feel like he's going to very shortly become a less

16:08.840 --> 16:17.080
effective ally. Let's hope. We can only hope. Yeah. So Alex gets, gets in, you know, he's,

16:17.080 --> 16:22.360
he's, he's quite a ways into the episode before he really says anything substantial.

16:22.360 --> 16:26.600
So let me give the number out to respond to Trump signing the.

16:27.880 --> 16:32.360
Declaration of, what? Emergency relief bill. It's really just a foreign globalist port

16:32.360 --> 16:37.640
barrel operation where the pardons or any of that, you're welcome to call in and we can all

16:37.640 --> 16:42.760
get our brownie points with Twitter and Facebook criticizing Trump. But that all really becomes a

16:42.760 --> 16:48.680
distraction from the world government, Bill Gates, the UN, the forced inoculations, the COVID systems,

16:48.680 --> 16:53.800
Joe Biden. I honestly can't tell if Alex is mad at Trump about the relief bill or not.

16:54.760 --> 16:58.840
No, it doesn't seem like he. I can tell that he's going to be mad at callers if they're

16:58.840 --> 17:03.560
mad at Trump about it though. I can tell that for sure. They're just trying to get Twitter brownie

17:03.560 --> 17:08.120
points, man. Yeah. Another thing that I was struck by listening to this is like, we're almost 30

17:08.120 --> 17:13.080
minutes into the show and granted Alex wasn't on air for most of it, but one of the lead stories

17:13.080 --> 17:17.880
isn't the Christmas morning bombing in Nashville that he interrupted his holiday to declare an

17:17.880 --> 17:22.680
almost certain false flag. Shouldn't there be a follow-up on that? Like Owen hosted the show on

17:22.680 --> 17:26.920
Sunday, so Alex didn't cover it then. So it seems like now would be a good time to do this a little

17:26.920 --> 17:32.200
bit more responsibly. Oh no, it happened a couple of days ago. You don't need to worry about it.

17:32.200 --> 17:36.680
I already forgot. So he doesn't get to this immediately. That's not the lead story. The

17:36.680 --> 17:44.520
lead story appears to be Trump should not leave office. I don't like that story. Inauguration

17:44.520 --> 17:50.840
is in 23 days. The coronation of the shy comm puppet there's they've built the stage there.

17:50.840 --> 17:56.040
Biden says he's not going to have one. It's going to be virtual. Well then why is the stage being

17:56.040 --> 18:01.560
built? Well, because Trump has refused to move out. Trump has refused to go. He's told his age,

18:01.560 --> 18:08.040
everybody don't start packing the furniture or the clothing or stuff. That's ours. We're not leaving.

18:08.040 --> 18:15.480
Well, what do you expect President Trump to do? President Trump shouldn't leave. President Trump

18:15.480 --> 18:24.120
shouldn't go. If it's fraud, he should fight on. This is just kind of sad because just imagine

18:24.120 --> 18:30.200
as anti-Bush as Alex pretends to be, just imagine him arguing in support of Al Gore squatting in the

18:30.200 --> 18:35.000
White House because the 2000 election was stolen. Right. Yeah. Earlier in this episode, Alex said

18:35.000 --> 18:39.320
that even if Trump was a horrible bad guy, the election was still stolen from him. So we have a

18:39.320 --> 18:44.680
responsibility to fight to overturn it. I know that he said that the 2000 election was fraudulent,

18:44.680 --> 18:49.880
but somehow I just can't imagine him working up this passion to support Bill Clinton's Vice

18:49.880 --> 18:55.320
President getting into office. Yeah. You know, the pyramids, they closed those off so you

18:55.320 --> 19:00.520
couldn't get out. So I'm fine. If Trump doesn't want to leave, we just board up the White House,

19:00.520 --> 19:06.520
build a nice little pyramid around it. And then, you know, he lives in comfort. I say we drop

19:06.520 --> 19:11.000
snakes in every now and again, just to keep things exciting, you know, for the few weeks they have

19:11.000 --> 19:15.080
with air or whatever. Exercise. Yeah, absolutely. Run away from snakes for a little while. Or hunt.

19:16.840 --> 19:21.560
Make sport of it. Just the Trump family running around the White House stabbing

19:21.560 --> 19:26.680
snakes. Yeah. Why not? I love it. Yeah. That'd be great. So Alex talks about like,

19:26.680 --> 19:32.200
about like, Hey, you know, I went to this rally, this Jericho March a while back, back in DC.

19:32.200 --> 19:36.840
Sure. And I said that Biden will not be president one way or another. A lot of people thought

19:36.840 --> 19:43.880
maybe rightly that speaking got a little bit. Yeah. I was not. And in fact, I'm a snitch.

19:45.320 --> 19:50.200
Okay. Yeah. All right. Sell me on this one. Alex out to himself as a snitch. Tell me on this.

19:50.200 --> 19:56.200
We elected president Trump in one way or another. Either by overturning the election and showing

19:56.200 --> 20:03.000
it's a fraud and, and, and, and getting Congress to act on January 6th to not certify it for Biden.

20:05.560 --> 20:08.600
Or whether we end up impeaching Joe Biden or getting him arrested,

20:08.600 --> 20:14.680
such high comm agent one way or another, he will be removed. And that's what I said in my speech

20:15.960 --> 20:20.280
a few weeks ago in DC that made national headlines, claiming I said, kill Joe Biden.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.920
Really? Why haven't I been arrested? Why? Because that's not what I said.

20:22.920 --> 20:29.480
The secret service hasn't called me. The last thing I want is for Joe Biden to get assassinated.

20:29.480 --> 20:33.640
That's how they can turn lemons into lemonade. That's how they can make that guy a victim and

20:33.640 --> 20:37.160
a good guy when he's a bad guy, then we'll have Kamala Harris probably worse.

20:40.520 --> 20:46.680
Secret service knows I'm on record, not once, not twice, but three times getting crazy people

20:46.680 --> 20:52.360
arrested who were actually stockpiling weapons and planning to kill presidents.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.960
These crazies have sent us letters and called us before and said, I'm going to

20:55.960 --> 20:59.960
kill George W. Bush. I'm going to kill Obama. You know what I do? I picked the phone up and

20:59.960 --> 21:05.400
I call the secret service. I don't believe Alex really, but if he did, if he, if that's true,

21:05.400 --> 21:08.840
good, you should be doing that. But also don't tell your audience.

21:08.840 --> 21:13.800
I would definitely not tell your audience that if we said, Hey, some people said,

21:14.600 --> 21:17.800
we're going to kill the president. We called the FBI and they got taken care of. People would be

21:17.800 --> 21:23.400
like, yeah, good job. It's the appropriate thing to do. It's deeply alienating of extreme right-wing

21:23.400 --> 21:27.720
weirdos. That's a problem. That's a problem for people who are interested in you.

21:27.720 --> 21:31.880
If you speak too freely, I will snitch. That's what Alex said.

21:33.000 --> 21:41.960
I am a turncoat. Look, I love the extreme stuff. I love it. I love dancing around it politically.

21:41.960 --> 21:47.640
Now, that said, I will call Janet Reno in a god damn second.

21:47.640 --> 21:54.600
This glass eye is, have you heard snitches get stitches? Yeah, this is a glass eye. All right.

21:54.600 --> 22:00.120
Let's, let's just keep that straight. Real, real fool, fool's move on Alex's part.

22:01.560 --> 22:07.320
Listen, all of you, I will turn you in. All right. Good work.

22:07.320 --> 22:13.080
So, uh, he's real disinterested in, uh, the Nashville, uh, situation, which I found kind

22:13.080 --> 22:19.560
of surprising because like I said, he put out a video about it on, on Christmas, which seems

22:19.560 --> 22:24.360
really kind of makes you think that maybe this is, you know, maybe he did smell something really

22:24.360 --> 22:29.960
important. Um, in the air, maybe, yeah, maybe he did pick up on some pattern that he wanted to flash

22:29.960 --> 22:34.760
out. Nah, he just doesn't really care, but still probably a false flag. All right. We're entering

22:34.760 --> 22:39.080
the phase of false flags. It's a lot of questions about what really happened at the bombing

22:39.640 --> 22:43.320
in Nashville. We've got Joel Skousen, world affairs brief, who's got a lot of

22:43.320 --> 22:46.520
excellent analysis joining us on that front. He says nothing.

22:46.520 --> 22:49.960
I was going to say, what the fuck could Skousen know about?

22:49.960 --> 22:55.720
I, if I know Skousen and I do a little, I would say he's going to say it's a false flag.

22:57.720 --> 23:01.640
But I can't say that for sure because he doesn't talk about it when he's on the show.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.640
Why would you? He doesn't know anything about it.

23:03.640 --> 23:08.840
He has bigger things to talk about. Our munitions expert Joel Skousen coming in.

23:08.840 --> 23:15.160
Well, you know, I'm sure Joel would have made time to talk about, uh, this possibly being a

23:15.160 --> 23:20.680
false flag, but yet more important things to do, like tell you, you've got to live

23:20.680 --> 23:24.040
an hour outside of town if you want to survive. Absolutely.

23:24.680 --> 23:29.080
Not too far because then it becomes like almost impossible to get supplies.

23:29.080 --> 23:32.520
Exactly. Yeah. But you have to get far away enough from

23:32.520 --> 23:35.320
places where there's large populations and people can't walk to you.

23:36.040 --> 23:39.000
He does go a while down that road. All right.

23:40.120 --> 23:45.640
I do like a good, uh, that sounds like when I was like six and my friends and I were building a

23:45.640 --> 23:50.040
snow fort and we like drew up like, there's going to be parapets here and there's going to be

23:50.040 --> 23:53.320
turrets and we're going to make sure that you, there's going to be murder holes.

23:53.320 --> 23:57.880
We're going to make a tree mache out of ice. Exactly. Yeah. Cool, man. Yeah. No,

23:57.880 --> 24:03.240
it's fun to dream. It's fun to dream. Yeah. Um, also I know exactly where to find Joel

24:03.240 --> 24:08.440
Skousen now. About an hour outside of town. Let's set up a radius.

24:10.840 --> 24:17.000
You've got to, we've got a Skousen perimeter. Also, it's not mileage. It's about an hour.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.800
Doesn't matter if you're driving or walking or wherever it is. It's just got to be about an hour.

24:21.800 --> 24:26.360
I think, I think it's by truck. By truck. Yeah. That's the sense I get.

24:26.360 --> 24:33.320
Right. Not as the crow flies. No, no. Crows can't get lumber back to your house or.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.720
That's true. Or piping. That's true. That's true.

24:35.720 --> 24:42.360
So Nashville, uh, conspiracies appear to have deflated quite a bit. Um, but there's an

24:42.360 --> 24:47.640
escalation going on surrounding COVID-19, uh, related stuff. And I'm getting to the point where

24:47.640 --> 24:52.680
I'm getting the sense that Alex is just saying it's not even real. Like he's dancing dangerously

24:52.680 --> 25:00.040
close to David Ike territory. China's open for business. They're bragging that we'll never be

25:00.040 --> 25:04.520
open that, that, that under, cause we didn't quote handle COVID, right. It's totally made up,

25:04.520 --> 25:10.760
totally hyped. PCR tests are fake. It's all admitted. So he seems to be implying that the

25:10.760 --> 25:17.320
tests themselves are all fake as opposed to amplifying and misleading people or what he,

25:17.320 --> 25:23.480
but he's so unclear. Yeah. He's so unclear. And he'll say like, I'm not saying the virus is fake,

25:23.480 --> 25:28.760
but all of the, the, the ways he's describing the circumstances would lead you to that conclusion.

25:28.760 --> 25:35.640
Sure. I would, I would just say like, my guess is he's just reactionary contrarian for the sake of

25:35.640 --> 25:40.680
it at this. Like if you say any of that, like, Oh, it's, it's 100% real. You'd be like, no, it's

25:40.680 --> 25:47.400
fake. No, I mean, the virus doesn't cause the test. No, I mean, the virus is real, but the tests are

25:47.400 --> 25:51.640
fake. Like there's no matter what something is fake enough for him to disregard the entirety

25:51.640 --> 25:56.120
of the thing. I think there's also a feeling of like, he's just desperate to be interesting.

25:56.120 --> 26:01.560
And so like, if you come in with a piece of information, he'll blow your mind with sort of

26:01.560 --> 26:08.680
the contradictory piece of it. Yeah. That's fair. So one thing also that he's contrary to is Trump.

26:08.680 --> 26:16.840
Sure. Kidding. Nice. But he's not very happy about those pardons. Oh, the ones where he

26:16.840 --> 26:23.000
pardoned war criminals and murderers and white supremacists and primers. It's hard to say what

26:23.000 --> 26:30.200
Alex doesn't approve of. The number one issue is not Trump's stupid pardons, which I disagree with

26:31.240 --> 26:35.640
these latest ones. It's terrible. The number one issues, world government, new world order

26:35.640 --> 26:41.240
technocracy, passports to travel, to leave your house, digital IDs, total control. It's not coming.

26:41.240 --> 26:45.800
It's here. So I want to know what you think the number one issue is and what we should do about

26:45.800 --> 26:52.840
it. So Alex has plenty of time to cover this story with responsibility. Like why don't you agree with

26:52.840 --> 26:59.000
those pardons? Which ones? Yeah. What's your problem? Right. And why do you think Trump

26:59.000 --> 27:04.840
pardoned those people anyway? Yeah. And so I was going through the pardon lists from the 22nd and

27:04.840 --> 27:09.880
the 23rd. Cause I was trying to figure out like, you know, what's the issue here. Yeah. And you

27:09.880 --> 27:15.160
know, you had like Roger Stone and Paul Manafort were probably like the headliners of those shows.

27:15.960 --> 27:21.080
And it's like, Alex can't be mad about that. No. That's like, he's for that. Yeah. So then it was

27:21.080 --> 27:27.000
like Charles Kushner, Jared Kushner's dad. Like maybe Alex is kind of wishy-washy on Jared. He

27:27.000 --> 27:33.000
thinks he's a globalist, but I've also heard Alex say that Charles Kushner was set up. Yeah. You

27:33.000 --> 27:37.560
know, he was just trying to prove that this person was cheating or whatever. Yeah. That was a good

27:37.560 --> 27:42.600
sell. Whatever the fuck. Almost got me on that one. Yeah. So I've seen him, you know, go both

27:42.600 --> 27:51.560
ways with that. So then of course, what you were referring to is the four dudes who were Blackwater

27:51.560 --> 27:57.160
mercenaries. Yeah. The serial killers. Who carried out the Nisour Square massacre. Yeah. Which is

27:57.160 --> 28:02.280
really fucked up considering that last year Trump pardoned, what was that guy? Eddie Gallagher? The

28:02.280 --> 28:09.560
dude who killed civilians. Yep. It's a bad, it's a bad pattern. No. I think I got a feeling that

28:09.560 --> 28:16.280
that's what Alex is talking about. Right. Because like so much of his career and any kind of like,

28:16.840 --> 28:21.720
you know, like, well, you got to give it to Alex is built on his opposition to the Iraq war. Yeah.

28:21.720 --> 28:28.120
So much of it is based on like, I am not a war hawk. I have principles. I'm not going to just

28:28.120 --> 28:33.240
go along with George W. Bush and this war that's built on a lie, you know, that kind of stuff

28:33.240 --> 28:37.880
is the only reason that his career had any legs to begin with. Yeah. Otherwise he would just be,

28:39.640 --> 28:44.760
I don't know, a hyper talented anti-communist weirdo no one's heard of. Yeah. Like that's

28:44.760 --> 28:50.840
what prompted people of other political alignments to consider him. Yeah. Like as being like,

28:50.840 --> 28:55.960
Hey, this guy's onto something. Yeah. If you go hard enough on, uh, everybody's enemy,

28:55.960 --> 29:00.600
some people will even from the opposite side be like, yeah, you're going real hard, man.

29:00.600 --> 29:06.280
I'm all about that. I had some friends in college who almost got sucked into LaRouche. Yeah. Yeah.

29:06.280 --> 29:10.760
Cause these guys all suck so bad. Yeah. And so I kind of thought about that as like,

29:10.760 --> 29:16.520
well, that would be such an invalidation of like really a core piece of Alex's like premise. Yeah.

29:16.520 --> 29:22.440
But it's like, we've heard him talk about wanting martial law and like putting the socialists and

29:22.440 --> 29:27.320
Antifa in camps and stuff. It's like, that's an, that's an invalidation. He could, you could do

29:27.320 --> 29:31.800
that if you wanted to. So I, here's my theory. What's your theory? I don't think it's actually

29:32.520 --> 29:39.320
those parties. Okay. I was looking through the list of pardons and I found that two pardons

29:39.320 --> 29:45.400
went to John Tate and Jesse Benton, the two Ron Paul campaign members who tried to bribe an Iowa

29:45.400 --> 29:51.560
state rep to switch his endorsement from Bachman to Ron Paul back in 2012. Yeah. You might think

29:51.560 --> 29:55.320
that Alex would support both of those pardons because he's excusing the crimes of people who

29:55.320 --> 30:01.240
are on the same side as Alex, but you'd be wrong. Alex hates Jesse Benton. He's indicated in the

30:01.240 --> 30:06.840
past that he feels like Benton has worked to keep him on the outside of things and that Benton

30:06.840 --> 30:12.840
weaseled his way into the Patriot movement by marrying Ron Paul's granddaughter. I do remember

30:12.840 --> 30:17.080
that. He went on a whole, he's done episodes about it. He's done a lot about that. That is

30:17.080 --> 30:24.840
really funny. And fucking hated that guy. He is a scourge on the Paul family. I think it might be

30:24.840 --> 30:28.760
that. That has to be it. That's hilarious. You know, you got to go with the psychology of the

30:28.760 --> 30:35.080
individual and there is nothing that motivates Alex more than petty grievance. Petty spite is

30:35.080 --> 30:40.280
number one on the things. Look, you could have murdered his family, but if Stelter walks by,

30:40.280 --> 30:44.360
it's Stelter who's going to get the hate. Philosophical consistency is what you would

30:44.360 --> 30:49.000
hope for. So you would hope it would be something like, you know, these people are out and at war

30:49.000 --> 30:54.200
criminals and pardoning them may in fact actually be a violation of the Geneva Convention. No,

30:54.200 --> 30:59.560
I believe it is. Yeah. Yeah. Experts in the field have indicated that it is. No, I mean,

30:59.560 --> 31:06.360
it is fucked up because more, I think, than any other decision that a president can make,

31:06.360 --> 31:11.480
pardons are intimate. Do you know what I mean? Like that, you pardoned somebody knowing full

31:11.480 --> 31:19.240
well that they were convicted of their crimes and chances are, did them. And pardoning those guys

31:19.240 --> 31:25.320
is very much like, brown people are not people to me. That's what that says. I am pardoning

31:25.320 --> 31:32.280
those people. The most generous interpretation is civilians in other countries are at the mercy of

31:32.280 --> 31:38.520
our military. The most generous. I would argue that it points more towards I'm fine with genocide,

31:38.520 --> 31:46.280
but yeah. I mean, that's the reality of it. So if you see Trump pardon those guys and you're

31:46.280 --> 31:51.880
fine with that, you're fine with everything. That's what it is. The message of it is harrowing.

31:51.880 --> 31:56.520
Yeah, it's terrifying. I mean, there's a lot of decisions that are made by elected officials

31:56.520 --> 32:04.440
that send like less than ideal messages. That's definitely true. But something like that does

32:04.440 --> 32:10.840
give a real middle finger to the idea that anyone in the rest of the world would treat us

32:10.840 --> 32:18.600
like we're operating from any kind of place of good faith. Any movie where they're like,

32:18.600 --> 32:25.080
oh, okay, we're going to go in, we've got this super murderer in the darkest dungeon and we're

32:25.080 --> 32:30.920
going to use him now. No, those are the bad guys. The guys who are like, yeah, let's set the dog

32:30.920 --> 32:36.840
loose. That's what this pardon is, is let's set the dogs loose on our enemies when it's fucked up.

32:37.640 --> 32:41.240
Not even our enemies, just people. Except in that one season of Heroes,

32:41.240 --> 32:43.560
where it's the guys on level five. That's true.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.760
Some of them were really bad, but I think a couple of them were actually got,

32:46.760 --> 32:48.760
they were just down there because their powers were too strong.

32:48.760 --> 32:52.920
Too strong. I don't remember exactly. They're weapons of mass destruction.

32:52.920 --> 32:57.960
I kind of lost interest in that. Don't worry about it. No one's hurting you.

32:57.960 --> 33:03.480
So Heroes is actually a work of science fiction. You might be surprised to learn

33:03.480 --> 33:05.960
that Alex took in a little piece of science fiction over the weekend.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.240
I am not surprised.

33:07.240 --> 33:13.640
So I want to go to Manuel, Diana, Brent, Seth, Kirk, Joe, Wendy, and others.

33:13.640 --> 33:15.000
Diana. Oh no.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.120
It's funny we got a lady named Diana calling in.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.160
Get the fuck out of here.

33:19.160 --> 33:23.960
Marvel comics, I don't like these modern movies. They're all full of propaganda and very,

33:23.960 --> 33:25.800
very boring and have really stupid plots.

33:25.800 --> 33:28.280
Yeah. Agreed.

33:28.280 --> 33:32.200
And a lot of men are kind of arrested development and spend their lives obsessing with it.

33:33.080 --> 33:36.600
But I got taken by some friends last night to see the new Wonder Woman movie.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.920
And I've seen the other two, been basically forced to watch those as well.

33:40.920 --> 33:44.680
They were unwatchable. This one was next level.

33:44.680 --> 33:45.560
You just went for a movie.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.080
It was like a hallucination.

33:47.080 --> 33:49.160
Why do you keep getting dragged to movies?

33:51.960 --> 33:54.760
Like half of his media diet he's being forced to watch.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.400
Just say that you like stuff.

33:57.400 --> 33:57.800
Yeah.

33:57.800 --> 33:58.680
Why can't you?

33:58.680 --> 34:00.600
Oh no, I'm not really that big a fan of Star Wars.

34:00.600 --> 34:01.160
No, no, no.

34:01.160 --> 34:02.520
I don't really do sports.

34:02.520 --> 34:03.160
No, no, no.

34:03.160 --> 34:04.920
I don't really do comic book movies.

34:04.920 --> 34:05.400
Fuck off.

34:05.400 --> 34:06.200
Say you like it.

34:06.200 --> 34:06.600
Yeah, yeah.

34:06.600 --> 34:09.400
You wanted to see Wonder Woman because you like comic book movies.

34:09.400 --> 34:09.560
Yeah.

34:09.560 --> 34:12.920
I got dragged to it opening weekend.

34:12.920 --> 34:16.280
Why? Why did you get dragged to it?

34:16.280 --> 34:23.960
I got dragged to a movie theater on opening weekend to see Wonder Woman 1984 during COVID.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.160
Yeah, yeah.

34:25.160 --> 34:28.920
By some of my friends who just dragged me there.

34:28.920 --> 34:29.160
Yeah.

34:29.160 --> 34:30.120
I got trussed up.

34:30.120 --> 34:30.760
Bizarre.

34:30.760 --> 34:32.280
I was gagged.

34:32.280 --> 34:32.600
Yeah.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.840
I was dragged from my truck.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.400
Although I will say that not liking it is

34:37.400 --> 34:40.440
probably the most obvious review you could imagine from Alex.

34:40.440 --> 34:41.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.080
It's female superhero.

34:43.080 --> 34:43.960
Yeah, done.

34:43.960 --> 34:45.320
Yeah, get the fuck out of here.

34:47.080 --> 34:48.840
Strangely loved the new Ghostbusters.

34:48.840 --> 34:49.560
Sure, sure.

34:49.560 --> 34:50.040
He did not.

34:50.040 --> 34:57.240
So anyway, it's basically like if you go see Wonder Woman, you're getting mind controlled.

34:57.240 --> 34:57.480
Okay.

34:58.120 --> 35:00.920
This one was next level propaganda.

35:00.920 --> 35:04.200
It was like a hallucination, flicker rates, everything.

35:04.200 --> 35:10.280
This is the future of mind control and a very positive message on the surface, a very negative

35:10.280 --> 35:11.960
one deeper into it.

35:12.920 --> 35:14.360
But it was very well done.

35:14.360 --> 35:15.560
What you wish for?

35:15.560 --> 35:18.200
Very cheesy at one level, very sophisticated at another.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.080
I mean, this is Stanley Kubrick level 2.0.

35:21.080 --> 35:22.040
So you liked it.

35:22.040 --> 35:24.680
Very, very sophisticated.

35:25.240 --> 35:30.120
So when you go see that movie, you are basically being mind controlled.

35:30.120 --> 35:30.520
Okay.

35:31.720 --> 35:33.480
I just say you didn't like the movie.

35:34.440 --> 35:35.480
I'm going to tell you this right now.

35:35.480 --> 35:35.800
Yeah.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.560
I saw about 80% of that movie.

35:37.560 --> 35:38.360
Uh huh.

35:38.360 --> 35:39.560
Fell asleep on the last part.

35:39.560 --> 35:40.760
But probably mind control.

35:40.760 --> 35:41.560
No, that was fine.

35:41.560 --> 35:42.280
No, it was fine.

35:42.280 --> 35:42.920
I was happy.

35:42.920 --> 35:45.080
The controllers just wanted you to fall asleep.

35:45.080 --> 35:46.200
Yeah, it was good stuff.

35:47.080 --> 35:47.560
Two things.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.480
Your subconscious brain took in the rest of it.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.800
And now I don't feel safe around you.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.080
Not sophisticated at all.

35:53.080 --> 35:53.480
Okay.

35:53.480 --> 35:54.360
Not even a little bit.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.640
Kind of a comic book movie?

35:55.640 --> 35:59.400
Two, Pedro Pascal is the greatest actor in the history of the world.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.280
Oh, it's amazing.

36:02.280 --> 36:02.760
Yeah.

36:02.760 --> 36:03.720
So good.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.000
He was the best part of it.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.800
Once his part was done, that's when I fell asleep.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.080
I was like, ah, fuck this.

36:09.080 --> 36:11.400
I think a lot of people feel the same way about Game of Thrones.

36:11.400 --> 36:11.960
Yeah.

36:11.960 --> 36:12.840
There we go.

36:12.840 --> 36:13.960
All right.

36:13.960 --> 36:14.760
Watch out.

36:14.760 --> 36:17.880
Yeah.

36:20.200 --> 36:22.040
Maybe it's a sign of getting older.

36:22.040 --> 36:23.080
Maybe I'm maturing.

36:23.080 --> 36:23.320
Yeah.

36:24.600 --> 36:27.560
I don't find Alex's movie reviews as good anymore.

36:27.560 --> 36:27.960
No.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.600
When he did the Watchmen, it was hilarious.

36:30.600 --> 36:31.320
Yeah.

36:31.320 --> 36:31.800
Yeah.

36:31.800 --> 36:35.560
This is kind of just a slow pitch.

36:35.560 --> 36:42.120
We're both too old to really get into a bad movie criticism of Wonder Woman.

36:42.840 --> 36:43.720
Maybe.

36:43.720 --> 36:47.560
I could stand someone telling me what's wrong with the plot,

36:47.560 --> 36:50.840
like if there's a structural issue with the story or something.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.360
It doesn't make sense, but that's fine.

36:52.920 --> 36:53.240
Yeah.

36:53.240 --> 36:54.920
I think you could probably still enjoy it.

36:54.920 --> 36:58.920
I mean, there's incredibly huge problems with most of the Fast and Furious movies.

36:58.920 --> 36:59.880
I can't think of any.

36:59.880 --> 37:00.600
They're still amazing.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.120
Internal logic is fine.

37:02.120 --> 37:02.620
Yeah.

37:03.800 --> 37:04.120
Yeah.

37:04.120 --> 37:05.480
I'm too old.

37:05.480 --> 37:09.720
Alex is 10 years older than me, and I'm too old to listen to his dumb ass

37:09.720 --> 37:12.440
tell me about how this is sophisticated mind control.

37:12.440 --> 37:13.320
I think it was interesting.

37:13.320 --> 37:15.160
Oh, the men are cowards.

37:15.160 --> 37:17.640
I think it was interesting the first time we watched it,

37:17.640 --> 37:22.760
because the juxtaposition of a gruff, ostensible newsman just being like,

37:22.760 --> 37:25.560
and Watchmen's stupid is very funny.

37:25.560 --> 37:29.720
And now we're on movie 300 of him being a child, and you're like, all right.

37:29.720 --> 37:33.720
But Watchmen 2, there was depth to his review.

37:33.720 --> 37:34.600
That's true.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.600
And he kept mispronouncing Ozymandias.

37:36.600 --> 37:37.080
That's true.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.440
Ozymandamus is pretty great.

37:38.440 --> 37:40.680
But there was something to that.

37:41.720 --> 37:42.760
He was swinging.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.040
He was swinging for the fences.

37:44.040 --> 37:44.520
That's true.

37:44.520 --> 37:49.480
And this is just kind of like, I kind of just get the sense that he was overwhelmed

37:49.480 --> 37:52.600
by the visuals and stuff and didn't understand the movie.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.360
And so he decided to call it brainwashing.

37:54.360 --> 37:54.860
Okay.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.240
This is beyond suspended disbelief.

37:57.240 --> 38:01.080
This is beyond lowering your brain waves to a near sleep state.

38:01.080 --> 38:02.280
This is beyond daydreaming.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.520
This was full on hallucination.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.480
And I was conscious of it second to second.

38:08.120 --> 38:10.600
But still, my brain was, you need to stop watching this.

38:10.600 --> 38:12.760
This is not good.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.640
So it was next level.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.080
Absolutely next level.

38:17.080 --> 38:18.840
I think he was just sitting there like, I don't know.

38:18.840 --> 38:19.880
I don't know what's going on.

38:21.640 --> 38:22.140
Yeah.

38:22.440 --> 38:26.920
I mean, you know, maybe take some brain force and it'll allow you to focus on the movie.

38:26.920 --> 38:27.560
That might help.

38:27.560 --> 38:28.060
Yeah.

38:28.280 --> 38:31.560
So he analyzes the film a little bit.

38:31.560 --> 38:35.160
And by the way, I'd like to point out that he's spending as much time on Wonder Woman

38:35.160 --> 38:36.200
for no fucking reason.

38:36.200 --> 38:36.600
No, no.

38:36.600 --> 38:37.560
Diana called.

38:37.560 --> 38:41.720
He, well, there is that, but he could have explained what his problem is with Trump's

38:41.720 --> 38:46.040
pardons in this time that he's wasting on trivial nonsense.

38:46.040 --> 38:46.280
Yeah.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.880
But he heard the name Diana.

38:47.880 --> 38:49.880
So you got to talk about Wonder Woman 84.

38:49.880 --> 38:50.200
Right.

38:50.200 --> 38:54.520
Or, I don't know, any other thing that has Diana in the name.

38:54.520 --> 38:55.000
Yeah.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.120
Princess Diana.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.800
Gotta talk about that.

38:57.800 --> 38:58.760
Couldn't come up with another.

39:00.600 --> 39:06.680
The whole theme is there's an end of world event coming and we're the ones making it

39:06.680 --> 39:09.400
happen because we want too much because of our desires.

39:09.400 --> 39:13.240
We've got to give our will over to something else to stop it.

39:13.240 --> 39:14.440
Then it tricks you.

39:14.440 --> 39:18.760
Your will has been given over to this antichrist character, but then you've got to denounce

39:18.760 --> 39:22.600
him, but give your will to another collective that is the goddess Diana.

39:25.480 --> 39:30.200
But you've still given your will over and it is, and men are bad.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.560
Women are going to lead us out of this.

39:32.440 --> 39:35.880
And that's what the Carnegie Endowment was set up to do was in the human species as we

39:35.880 --> 39:40.760
know it, not just going to end men, they're going to end women as well and make us corporate

39:40.760 --> 39:44.760
creations that are patented and controlled in the globalist, our God.

39:44.760 --> 39:45.480
Two stars.

39:50.280 --> 39:55.880
So I was listening to that and I was like, okay, I've not seen this movie and I'm not

39:55.880 --> 40:00.200
going to see this movie probably just because, and not because I don't want to or anything.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.720
I just don't see movies that often.

40:01.720 --> 40:02.920
No, no, you'll be fine.

40:02.920 --> 40:13.720
It looks good like any hero movie is, but I was guessing that there's some sort of a

40:13.720 --> 40:20.840
villain that tricks people into supporting them and then Wonder Woman gets their support

40:20.840 --> 40:23.000
and that is how she's able to be successful.

40:23.000 --> 40:23.500
Kinda.

40:24.360 --> 40:25.240
But it's close enough.

40:25.240 --> 40:27.240
That's what he's talking about more or less, right?

40:27.240 --> 40:28.840
Yeah, but the problem is...

40:28.840 --> 40:32.440
Like, give your will to someone and support them.

40:32.440 --> 40:36.200
Just, no spoilers because I didn't finish the movie.

40:38.520 --> 40:39.960
No spoilers because I can't.

40:39.960 --> 40:41.320
Because I can't spoil it.

40:41.320 --> 40:48.440
But the main bad guy is Pedro Pascal, Nicolas caging all over the scenery and he can grant

40:48.440 --> 40:51.160
wishes, but it's a monkey's paw scenario.

40:51.800 --> 40:54.280
It's a classic, what do you want?

40:54.280 --> 40:55.480
And there's a price for it.

40:55.480 --> 40:58.120
Oh, okay, so he's a Twilight Zone episode.

40:58.120 --> 41:02.520
Exactly, yes, the entire movie is Nicolas Cage Twilight Zoning everyone.

41:03.800 --> 41:06.200
My review of the movie is very simple.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.920
At the beginning, it's butt.

41:08.920 --> 41:11.560
And then in the middle, you're like, oh, this is pretty interesting.

41:11.560 --> 41:12.600
And then it's butt again.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.040
Like, that's the whole movie.

41:14.040 --> 41:14.840
What do you mean butt?

41:14.840 --> 41:15.960
I mean butt.

41:15.960 --> 41:16.840
Like a buttocks?

41:16.840 --> 41:17.880
It's bad.

41:17.880 --> 41:18.120
Oh.

41:18.120 --> 41:18.760
Yeah.

41:18.760 --> 41:20.040
There's nothing wrong with buttockses.

41:20.040 --> 41:20.920
No, there's...

41:20.920 --> 41:21.640
Okay, fine.

41:21.640 --> 41:23.080
I don't understand that being a...

41:23.080 --> 41:24.360
All right, fair enough.

41:24.360 --> 41:26.760
I feel like there's another way you could have expressed that.

41:26.760 --> 41:28.280
Asshead.

41:28.280 --> 41:29.240
No?

41:29.240 --> 41:29.800
I don't know.

41:29.800 --> 41:30.280
All right.

41:30.280 --> 41:33.080
Anyway, don't watch Wonder Woman on LSD, bro.

41:33.880 --> 41:38.440
So again, lots of cheesiness, lots of kid stuff, lots of mindlessness, lots of 80s

41:38.440 --> 41:42.040
nostalgia, but that's just for your conscious brain.

41:42.040 --> 41:46.520
Behind it, all the other manipulations taking place.

41:46.520 --> 41:57.320
So I'll do a more in-depth review later, but it was definitely mind control caliber material.

41:57.320 --> 41:59.800
I definitely would not take it on LSD.

41:59.800 --> 42:06.040
Yeah, I think that most bright, flashy things might be a little bit tough to take.

42:07.080 --> 42:11.240
Watch while you're on LSD when you're 46 years old.

42:11.240 --> 42:14.840
Probably with a history of amphetamine abuse.

42:14.840 --> 42:17.880
And a loose grasp on reality.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.560
Yeah, to begin with, yeah.

42:19.560 --> 42:20.360
From the jump.

42:20.360 --> 42:20.600
Yeah.

42:23.080 --> 42:24.280
I don't think so.

42:24.280 --> 42:25.960
I don't think that's a smart move on his part.

42:25.960 --> 42:26.520
No!

42:26.520 --> 42:26.680
No.

42:27.480 --> 42:29.320
So Alex does not really...

42:29.320 --> 42:33.000
I don't think he gets back into a more in-depth Wonder Woman review, which actually...

42:33.640 --> 42:37.160
I'm equal parts disappointed and glad he didn't.

42:38.680 --> 42:44.040
I could have used something a little bit deeper than this, but at the same time, I don't care.

42:44.040 --> 42:45.000
Yeah.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.440
He'll do it eventually.

42:46.440 --> 42:51.560
The way he describes Wonder Woman makes me want to watch they live with him, just to see if like...

42:51.560 --> 42:55.080
Does he even see the hidden messages, like the consumed messages?

42:55.080 --> 42:56.840
Does he just see like a blank sheet?

42:56.840 --> 43:00.200
And he's like, well, I don't get why these people hate these aliens, so they're great.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.040
Capitalists are running everything.

43:02.040 --> 43:04.840
All these people, what are you even looking at blank signs for?

43:04.840 --> 43:05.240
Come on.

43:05.240 --> 43:07.720
We can talk about this the next time it comes up.

43:07.720 --> 43:08.440
Yeah.

43:08.440 --> 43:09.000
Or maybe...

43:09.640 --> 43:10.920
No, I already did this with Marty.

43:10.920 --> 43:11.320
Uh-oh.

43:11.320 --> 43:14.040
The episode where Rowdy Roddy Piper was on Info Wars.

43:14.040 --> 43:14.920
Oh, that's right!

43:14.920 --> 43:16.360
And he talked about they live, yeah.

43:16.360 --> 43:19.400
Don't think Alex gets a whole lot of...

43:19.400 --> 43:19.900
Yeah.

43:21.240 --> 43:24.600
So in this next clip, Alex says something that is completely...

43:25.800 --> 43:27.000
I just don't understand it.

43:28.280 --> 43:31.080
The first part of it, categorically not true.

43:31.080 --> 43:33.240
The second part, impossible.

43:33.240 --> 43:33.960
Okay.

43:33.960 --> 43:35.160
You know, you're an American.

43:37.720 --> 43:40.040
You've been brought up that America's bad, America's terrible,

43:40.040 --> 43:42.360
it's the worst place on earth, we're the most oppressive people anywhere,

43:42.360 --> 43:44.280
and statistically it's actually the opposite.

43:44.920 --> 43:46.920
But we're never taught about the evils and corruption

43:46.920 --> 43:49.480
that goes on in other places where tyranny is in charge.

43:50.200 --> 43:54.680
But when you look at historical tyranny through the last few thousand years,

43:54.680 --> 43:57.640
and then current tyrannies, and tyrannies the last hundred years,

43:58.200 --> 44:01.880
every form of tyranny, every form of abuse,

44:01.880 --> 44:04.840
every form of oppression and really nasty stuff,

44:04.840 --> 44:08.360
and the worst people being in charge is in the UN,

44:08.360 --> 44:11.000
is in the world government, is in the corporate governance,

44:11.000 --> 44:12.760
is in the communist Chinese.

44:12.760 --> 44:15.560
That makes no sense, that part at the end there.

44:15.560 --> 44:16.060
Yeah.

44:16.360 --> 44:17.720
The last thousand years.

44:17.720 --> 44:20.280
I mean, I guess you could go with China.

44:20.280 --> 44:20.760
Sure.

44:20.760 --> 44:21.160
Perhaps.

44:21.160 --> 44:24.440
But the UN, leading that sentence is tough.

44:24.440 --> 44:26.600
The way you make that sentence work is you just pretend

44:26.600 --> 44:28.920
that the world government is everything you don't like.

44:28.920 --> 44:29.720
Yeah, yeah.

44:29.720 --> 44:33.720
And that the UN is actually also the, you know, the League of Nations,

44:33.720 --> 44:37.400
and it's also every government that has ever existed throughout Europe,

44:37.400 --> 44:38.840
and you know, whatever.

44:38.840 --> 44:39.560
I think it's really...

44:40.200 --> 44:41.720
Just define your own terms,

44:41.720 --> 44:44.440
and then you can say all corruption has been part of this.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.200
I think it's really funny that he absolutely cannot bring up

44:48.200 --> 44:51.400
a very obvious one in Russia with just being like,

44:51.400 --> 44:53.960
well, Putin has declared himself president for life,

44:53.960 --> 44:58.920
and any crimes that he commits are retroactively impossible to charge him for.

44:58.920 --> 45:04.200
He just attempted to kill the only person running against him for leadership.

45:04.200 --> 45:10.520
Yep. That sounds a lot like stuff Alex wants Trump to do.

45:13.240 --> 45:14.520
Like one-to-one.

45:14.520 --> 45:17.800
And I think that the problem is that in America,

45:17.800 --> 45:21.240
we're never taught about other places doing bad things.

45:21.240 --> 45:21.720
Never!

45:21.720 --> 45:22.920
We never hear about it.

45:22.920 --> 45:23.420
Never.

45:24.040 --> 45:24.760
Uh-uh.

45:24.760 --> 45:25.720
Not something...

45:25.720 --> 45:28.600
We definitely don't hear about bad things happening in other countries

45:28.600 --> 45:31.080
very differently than when they happen here, too.

45:31.080 --> 45:34.360
It would be wild if we were to cover different stories,

45:34.360 --> 45:35.720
you know, the same story differently.

45:35.720 --> 45:36.600
That'd just be crazy.

45:36.600 --> 45:41.320
We never have people on the radio talking about how the Civil War was about to take place.

45:41.320 --> 45:42.120
No, never!

45:42.120 --> 45:42.620
No, no, no.

45:44.040 --> 45:45.160
So that was weird.

45:45.160 --> 45:46.520
I got very confused by that.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.240
And then I got kind of mad.

45:50.040 --> 45:54.520
So pretty amazing information.

45:54.520 --> 45:56.840
And when John Hopkins put that report out,

45:57.640 --> 45:59.560
they had Snopes and everybody go,

45:59.560 --> 46:03.400
oh, it's false. So they go, well, all the year's numbers aren't in.

46:03.400 --> 46:04.840
But in the study, they looked at that.

46:05.480 --> 46:09.000
They looked at last year, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands more

46:09.000 --> 46:10.440
already than it would be this year.

46:10.440 --> 46:14.440
So they averaged in the rest of the year and found still about the same deaths.

46:16.200 --> 46:18.920
But they said, well, it's not totally scientific.

46:18.920 --> 46:20.040
Down to the person.

46:20.040 --> 46:21.400
Well, nothing is with statistics.

46:21.400 --> 46:28.280
So that's how they spin the fact into something that they can then obfuscate.

46:28.280 --> 46:29.960
This is really simple.

46:29.960 --> 46:36.120
According to the CDC, there were 2,839,205 deaths total in 2019,

46:36.120 --> 46:40.760
a rate of about 867 per 100,000 population.

46:40.760 --> 46:43.320
We don't have the total data for 2020 yet,

46:43.320 --> 46:45.880
and reliable figures won't be available for months.

46:45.880 --> 46:50.680
But the AP reported that scholars estimate the number will be over 3.2 million.

46:51.320 --> 46:54.280
Typically, you would expect a consistent rate of death

46:54.280 --> 46:58.280
to produce between 20,000 and 50,000 extra deaths each year

46:58.280 --> 47:02.360
as the population ages and also increases in just a total number.

47:02.360 --> 47:03.400
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

47:03.400 --> 47:05.800
There's just a reality that people are dying,

47:05.800 --> 47:10.280
and Alex's political position depends on him living in complete denial of that fact.

47:10.920 --> 47:14.920
And I don't mean to be too preachy, but I hope this haunts him for the rest of his life,

47:14.920 --> 47:17.240
how ghastly this kind of behavior is.

47:17.240 --> 47:21.720
People are suffering and losing loved ones for him just to pull this kind of bullshit.

47:21.720 --> 47:25.720
It's just, I want more Wonder Woman reviews.

47:25.720 --> 47:27.000
I don't want this shit.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.400
This is what I was telling you before the episode.

47:29.400 --> 47:32.280
I was like, yeah, I got one of those moments I haven't had in a while

47:32.280 --> 47:34.040
where I just had to walk away from the computer.

47:34.040 --> 47:37.320
I had to stand up and be like, no, no, no.

47:37.320 --> 47:41.000
You know, my family is what they are,

47:41.000 --> 47:44.760
but my little sister and her husband both tested positive not too long ago.

47:45.400 --> 47:51.080
And I just, like the possibilities for damage to them,

47:51.080 --> 47:55.800
that we aren't even considering, like, fine, I get it.

47:55.800 --> 47:57.400
You don't think that you're going to die.

47:58.040 --> 47:58.680
That's great.

47:59.720 --> 48:01.880
Like, have you not seen long COVID symptoms?

48:01.880 --> 48:05.160
Have you not seen people's psychosis manifest?

48:05.160 --> 48:09.080
Like, how do you not understand how terrifyingly dangerous this shit is?

48:09.640 --> 48:11.640
And it happened to people in my family.

48:11.640 --> 48:13.800
You know, like, there's no escape from it.

48:13.800 --> 48:16.360
And it's because of fucking monsters like this.

48:16.360 --> 48:18.280
Oh, it's because of at least behaviors like this.

48:18.280 --> 48:19.560
Yes, totally.

48:19.560 --> 48:21.080
So fucking, yeah.

48:21.080 --> 48:24.360
The unknown unknowns, I think is partially what you're talking about too.

48:24.360 --> 48:26.280
And it's just like, I don't know.

48:28.280 --> 48:31.720
I hope that he lives long enough to be haunted by this.

48:31.720 --> 48:32.280
Yeah, please.

48:33.080 --> 48:35.000
So Alex does finally get to taking calls.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.560
I'm not sure if he ever gets around to Diana.

48:37.560 --> 48:40.520
I regret to inform you that I think he takes two calls on this episode.

48:40.520 --> 48:41.480
Hilarious.

48:41.480 --> 48:45.400
But one guy calls in, he wants to talk about how diverse Trump rallies are.

48:45.400 --> 48:52.920
I feel like the fake news media and fellow MPC Americans, they're expecting a specific

48:52.920 --> 48:56.600
archetype of Trump supporters to be there in DC.

48:56.600 --> 49:03.720
But I feel like they'll be greatly shocked at the intellectual diversity that will come

49:03.720 --> 49:06.360
crashing through in DC on January 6th.

49:06.360 --> 49:07.640
Well, they are shocked.

49:07.640 --> 49:11.400
I mean, they tried to always say the Tea Party was racist so that blacks, Hispanics and Asians

49:11.400 --> 49:12.280
wouldn't go.

49:12.280 --> 49:15.960
That started to fail about eight years ago as people went and were totally accepted and

49:15.960 --> 49:16.760
loved.

49:16.760 --> 49:21.400
And then now under Trump, you go and you'll have an over-representation at some of these

49:21.400 --> 49:23.240
rallies of blacks, Hispanics and others.

49:23.240 --> 49:28.280
And the media, that's what put them into total race-based panic mode to say Trump is Hitler

49:28.280 --> 49:29.240
because they don't know what to do.

49:29.240 --> 49:33.480
I mean, look, Trump got three times more black men to vote for him than any Republican ever.

49:33.480 --> 49:36.280
That scares the living snot out of the establishment.

49:37.800 --> 49:39.080
Oh yeah, of course it does.

49:39.080 --> 49:41.880
So this caller brought up intellectual diversity.

49:41.880 --> 49:42.120
Yeah.

49:42.120 --> 49:45.560
And Alex immediately starts talking about racial...

49:45.560 --> 49:46.280
Right.

49:46.280 --> 49:48.760
Well, they don't actually have any intellectual diversity.

49:49.320 --> 49:51.880
I don't know what he was trying to say.

49:51.880 --> 49:57.560
I think that people have the image of Trump fans from past Trump rallies.

49:57.560 --> 49:58.360
I think that that...

49:58.360 --> 49:59.960
The ones where we saw them.

49:59.960 --> 50:01.880
History is prelude, as they say.

50:01.880 --> 50:04.600
You expect about that.

50:04.600 --> 50:11.800
Sometimes I really do think that the GOP thinks maybe there are 10 black people total, and

50:11.800 --> 50:16.360
then when one shows up at the rally, they're like, we got 10% of the entire...

50:16.360 --> 50:18.440
How do you not think these things are diverse?

50:18.440 --> 50:20.520
We got 10% of all black people here.

50:20.520 --> 50:27.240
Well, what I think is interesting is the inability for Alex to hear diversity and not immediately

50:27.240 --> 50:36.040
jump into defense mode about the clear lack of diversity at these rallies.

50:36.040 --> 50:40.840
From that standpoint, intellectual diversity, I guess, means that some people want to shoot

50:40.840 --> 50:43.560
people and some people want to go the legislative route.

50:43.560 --> 50:44.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:44.040 --> 50:45.080
I guess maybe that's...

50:45.080 --> 50:45.880
A lot of diversity there.

50:45.880 --> 50:53.400
Some people are Mies Institute libertarian types, and some people are outright fascists.

50:53.400 --> 50:56.680
So you've got a lot of people on different sides.

50:56.680 --> 51:02.680
Also, not for nothing, Trump got 8% of the black vote in the last election, so it's definitely

51:02.680 --> 51:07.480
better to report that as, oh, record black support, instead of just saying, hey, this

51:07.480 --> 51:12.040
party that I support has never gotten over 10%.

51:12.040 --> 51:15.560
Has so alienated an entire group of people.

51:15.560 --> 51:20.600
Much like Trump's pardons, let's not consider any of the surrounding context of that.

51:21.880 --> 51:24.600
But man, Alex has a great idea.

51:24.600 --> 51:25.160
What's that?

51:25.160 --> 51:33.560
If his goal is to incite violence and an insurrection among right-wing people in this country, he

51:33.560 --> 51:35.000
has an amazing idea.

51:35.800 --> 51:37.320
Thank God he hasn't conceded.

51:37.320 --> 51:41.640
We need to keep exposing the fraud, keep showing the evidence, and then no matter what happens,

51:42.360 --> 51:46.520
Trump is still our president, and I think he should have that talking point, because

51:46.520 --> 51:53.320
it's true that the power structure in the system has occupied America and put in their

51:53.320 --> 51:59.800
puppet and that Trump should then travel around the country rallying legislatures, state houses,

51:59.800 --> 52:04.200
and others, and he should have a nightly TV program where he, it'll have more ratings

52:04.200 --> 52:06.040
than Fox, talks to the public.

52:06.040 --> 52:09.480
Yeah, he should have a nightly show where he pretends to be the second president and

52:09.480 --> 52:14.040
the rightful president of the United States because there's an occupier in the house.

52:15.720 --> 52:21.080
I don't know if I want to live in a 2020 where we're reliving like the pope and the dark

52:21.080 --> 52:24.120
pope fighting in Italy in the 17th century.

52:24.120 --> 52:26.360
I don't want to live where that is.

52:26.360 --> 52:28.120
I don't get why we're still doing that.

52:28.840 --> 52:30.280
It wasn't good for people.

52:30.280 --> 52:32.040
No, it was bad.

52:32.760 --> 52:36.520
But yeah, when I was listening to this, I was like, okay, it's a stupid idea.

52:36.520 --> 52:37.560
Trump's never going to do that.

52:38.120 --> 52:42.200
The TV show, maybe, if it profits him somehow, yes.

52:42.200 --> 52:49.000
He's not going to go on a barnstorming tour of state legislatures in order to save the

52:49.000 --> 52:49.880
Constitution.

52:49.880 --> 52:52.040
I mean, essentially you would be describing a war.

52:53.880 --> 52:58.760
But he's also going to go from town to town recruiting for his fucking army.

52:58.760 --> 53:03.080
Well, I mean, he's one of the greatest orators of our generation.

53:03.080 --> 53:09.480
He'll go and give really measured, thoughtful speeches about the responsibilities of

53:09.480 --> 53:10.280
statementship.

53:10.280 --> 53:10.840
Oh man.

53:12.040 --> 53:16.040
I just found that this kind of, this section of the show just really struck me as like

53:16.040 --> 53:18.760
what I would describe as terrorist edging.

53:18.760 --> 53:19.880
Yeah, yeah.

53:19.880 --> 53:23.400
It's just trying to get these people right up to the point of...

53:23.400 --> 53:24.520
But that's what this is.

53:24.520 --> 53:28.200
This whole, like, since he lost the election, it has been nothing but edging.

53:28.200 --> 53:29.640
Like, we're going to do it this time.

53:29.640 --> 53:31.720
No, no, we're not going to blow it up this time.

53:31.720 --> 53:32.680
But next time I do it...

53:32.680 --> 53:36.120
But it feels pretty, like, really pronounced on this 28th.

53:36.840 --> 53:38.280
We don't value ourselves.

53:38.280 --> 53:38.840
So guess what?

53:38.840 --> 53:40.360
The new world order doesn't value us.

53:41.160 --> 53:44.520
And God will let us have what we want.

53:45.880 --> 53:47.480
We forsake ourselves.

53:47.480 --> 53:50.520
God didn't forsake us.

53:50.520 --> 53:55.320
We took all the blessings and threw them out the window because we had a game of tennis

53:55.320 --> 53:56.680
to play or golf to player.

53:56.680 --> 53:59.400
We were going to go act cool with our friends and get drunk again.

53:59.400 --> 54:00.280
And so we'll care.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.400
Let somebody else handle it.

54:01.400 --> 54:02.120
Okay.

54:02.120 --> 54:03.800
Everything will be taken from you now.

54:03.800 --> 54:04.440
Everything.

54:04.440 --> 54:08.120
And they're going to do it in increments where you join along, you'll be taken care of.

54:08.120 --> 54:10.760
And then, oh, it gets a little harder, but you still join.

54:10.760 --> 54:14.040
You still keep complying while you're being strangled.

54:14.680 --> 54:15.000
All right.

54:15.000 --> 54:19.240
Let's go to Mike in Arizona.

54:19.240 --> 54:19.960
Mike, you're on the air.

54:19.960 --> 54:20.520
Go ahead.

54:20.520 --> 54:22.040
Weird sound there.

54:22.040 --> 54:22.520
Yeah.

54:22.520 --> 54:26.040
There's a little burp, a little something stuck in his throat.

54:26.040 --> 54:26.920
Some reflux.

54:26.920 --> 54:29.160
Maybe had some nachos out at the Alamo Drafthouse.

54:29.160 --> 54:32.600
Hey, everybody's got to get something to eat during WW84.

54:32.600 --> 54:35.720
Yeah, I just hear that stuff.

54:35.720 --> 54:42.200
And it's just like, hey, you could keep, you know, getting along, going along to get along.

54:42.200 --> 54:44.360
But that's how you're going to end up in submission.

54:44.360 --> 54:48.440
You're going to end up in shackles unless you blow something up.

54:48.440 --> 54:49.080
Yeah.

54:49.080 --> 54:50.680
It kind of feels that way a little bit.

54:50.680 --> 54:51.640
Yeah, it does.

54:51.640 --> 54:56.440
I think that there's something to it, too, where Alex is saying, like, we brought this

54:56.440 --> 54:57.640
on ourselves.

54:57.640 --> 54:59.000
It's your own fault.

54:59.560 --> 55:04.840
And that's to, you know, be the guilt fuel that you kind of need to get yourself into

55:04.840 --> 55:06.600
a position where maybe you do something stupid.

55:06.600 --> 55:07.100
Totally.

55:07.800 --> 55:12.120
So one of the things that I think is really weird, and I think we've talked about this

55:12.120 --> 55:15.240
a bit, is that Alex believes that masks are evil.

55:15.240 --> 55:15.560
Sure.

55:15.560 --> 55:18.600
And wearing them is a mouth diaper and what have you.

55:19.960 --> 55:21.160
But he sells them.

55:21.160 --> 55:22.040
Well, yeah, of course.

55:22.040 --> 55:23.640
So he rationalizes that here a little bit.

55:23.640 --> 55:24.140
Let's do it.

55:24.760 --> 55:27.320
I'm not talking about any particular individual.

55:28.120 --> 55:33.640
I'm talking about the way a Pharisee brain works is very one dimensional.

55:33.640 --> 55:37.640
Like you say the mask are a fraud and cause bacterial pneumonia.

55:37.640 --> 55:38.840
You say they don't protect you.

55:38.840 --> 55:40.440
You say they're a symbol of slavery.

55:40.440 --> 55:44.040
Then what are you doing selling mask?

55:44.840 --> 55:50.120
Well, when we launched them, I made the decision to print it with info wars com.

55:50.120 --> 55:54.760
So if you're on a plane or in a restaurant where it's a private place and they're making

55:54.760 --> 56:00.600
you do it and you need to go there for whatever reason, you wear it to fight back and then

56:00.600 --> 56:02.840
use the abuse like a judo move.

56:02.840 --> 56:03.880
They attack you.

56:03.880 --> 56:06.120
You use their momentum to throw them through the wall.

56:06.120 --> 56:07.400
No, no, we get it.

56:07.400 --> 56:13.160
That's that we don't we don't no one misunderstands that we understand that he's selling these

56:13.160 --> 56:17.480
masks in an attempt to encourage his audience to be oppositional, defiant to people in public

56:17.480 --> 56:21.880
and hopefully cause a scene big enough to go viral and get some free press for info wars.

56:21.880 --> 56:24.600
We understand that the meaning is clear.

56:25.480 --> 56:29.560
The thing that I think is fascinating, though, is that Alex can't grasp the critique that's

56:29.560 --> 56:32.840
coming from the other side, namely our critique.

56:32.840 --> 56:38.200
I would say that it's strange that, you know, you think that this is a sign of slavery,

56:38.200 --> 56:44.280
but that somehow this sign of slavery is OK if it's a branded sign of slavery that Alex

56:44.280 --> 56:49.720
can profit off of somehow, whether by selling it or the free press that comes from it or

56:49.720 --> 56:54.200
the potential new audience that gets exposed to your product by other people wearing it.

56:54.200 --> 56:55.560
It's it's it's weird.

56:55.560 --> 57:00.760
It's it's strange that a sign of slavery would somehow become acceptable if you benefit from

57:00.760 --> 57:02.920
hey, it's a sign of slavery.

57:02.920 --> 57:06.520
But, you know, if we're going to have slavery, might as well make a little cash on it.

57:06.520 --> 57:07.480
That's fucked up.

57:07.480 --> 57:10.360
Yeah, it's really fucked up because that's pretty much what he said.

57:10.360 --> 57:10.760
Yeah.

57:10.760 --> 57:13.080
Also, he can straight fuck himself.

57:13.080 --> 57:17.320
If Alex spent even a minute looking into the history of how enslaved people were branded

57:17.320 --> 57:21.960
and mutilated to signify that they were enslaved, probably feel pretty bad and maybe a little

57:21.960 --> 57:25.080
bit petty, complaining about having to wear a mask to go to Kroger.

57:25.080 --> 57:26.760
You would think you're a fucking dick.

57:26.760 --> 57:35.960
Yep, but he did brave the slavery of public spaces or something because he needed to see

57:35.960 --> 57:36.680
Wonder Woman.

57:37.400 --> 57:40.360
And then I talked to everybody I saw in the movie theater.

57:40.360 --> 57:41.000
It was amazing.

57:41.880 --> 57:45.960
Alamo Drafthouse, horrible socialist globalist on it.

57:45.960 --> 57:46.520
They love it.

57:46.520 --> 57:48.280
You go in, all the lights are turned off.

57:48.280 --> 57:49.400
It's like dystopic.

57:50.200 --> 57:55.160
They're sitting there with wanting to, you know, with a thermometer, a laser thermometer

57:55.160 --> 57:57.640
to, you know, to all get into theater.

57:57.640 --> 58:00.680
And I said to the guy, I said, you know, the same amount of people who've died this year

58:00.680 --> 58:01.560
that died last year, right?

58:02.360 --> 58:03.080
This is all a fraud.

58:03.080 --> 58:05.160
He goes, I know, but we're just doing to keep you safe.

58:05.160 --> 58:07.080
Oh, if I never existed, I'd be safe.

58:07.080 --> 58:08.840
It's all a fraud to shut down the economy.

58:08.840 --> 58:10.440
You won't even have your job soon, buddy.

58:10.440 --> 58:12.360
This is a global takeover.

58:12.360 --> 58:15.080
And the people that own Alamo are horrible leftists.

58:15.080 --> 58:16.360
Sir, just go see the movie.

58:16.360 --> 58:17.000
You can even imagine.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.800
Sir, do you want butter on your popcorn?

58:19.800 --> 58:22.440
The last 11 months and it was just a disgrace.

58:22.440 --> 58:23.000
We'll be right back.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.400
Stay with us.

58:25.400 --> 58:26.360
Watch it at home.

58:30.360 --> 58:31.720
You sound miserable.

58:33.480 --> 58:34.360
I don't get it.

58:34.360 --> 58:38.680
Why would you go to this theater that's run by terrible socialist globalists as opposed

58:38.680 --> 58:40.280
to just renting it at home?

58:40.280 --> 58:44.920
How can you even, how can you go give money to terrible socialist globalists?

58:44.920 --> 58:47.400
It seems like it's counter to everything Alex stands for.

58:47.400 --> 58:48.280
Yeah, totally.

58:48.280 --> 58:52.920
It seems like he's probably rich enough that he has a pretty comfortable TV in his living

58:52.920 --> 58:56.920
room, I would assume, based on how many goddamn movies he talks about watching.

58:56.920 --> 58:58.840
You'd think he's got a pretty cushy setup.

58:58.840 --> 59:01.240
Maybe even an in-home theater set up.

59:02.120 --> 59:04.200
Watch this movie around loved ones.

59:04.200 --> 59:05.240
Oh wait, can't.

59:05.960 --> 59:08.200
He risks brainwashing his children.

59:08.200 --> 59:09.080
That's true.

59:09.080 --> 59:15.080
His children may not be strong enough to resist the wiles of the subliminal messages that

59:15.080 --> 59:16.280
are in Wonder Woman 84.

59:16.280 --> 59:19.080
Wonder Woman did get an R rating for its subliminal messaging.

59:19.080 --> 59:19.480
Yeah.

59:19.480 --> 59:19.960
Yeah.

59:19.960 --> 59:20.520
No kidding.

59:20.520 --> 59:22.440
18 and older without an adult.

59:22.440 --> 59:23.080
Yeah.

59:23.080 --> 59:26.200
M-P-A-A-S for subliminal.

59:26.200 --> 59:27.160
Yes, exactly.

59:28.280 --> 59:29.080
Yeah, dumb.

59:29.080 --> 59:30.200
This is dumb.

59:30.200 --> 59:31.480
I mean, I'm not gonna judge.

59:31.480 --> 59:35.160
I'm not gonna judge him for going to a socialist globalist theater.

59:35.160 --> 59:39.880
I go see the Cubs game and the Ricketts are terrible fascist nightmare people.

59:39.880 --> 59:41.960
So what are you gonna do?

59:41.960 --> 59:49.480
I think that there is an argument to be made for like, if you have to, you can't watch

59:49.480 --> 59:55.160
the Cubs live except by paying for a ticket to go to Wrigley or, you know, I guess you

59:55.160 --> 59:56.040
could travel to another city.

59:56.040 --> 01:00:01.160
You can't watch them on TV without giving money to the Cubs that own their own goddamn

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:01.560
network.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.200
They're evil.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:05.960
And you could make a similar argument that renting the movie at home would still be giving

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.000
money to the studios and, you know, he doesn't support them.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:09.400
Whatever.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.040
I don't care.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.520
VPN torrent. Let's do this.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.120
Get off the grid, buddy.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:20.760
Still, I don't think it's a great idea to go to a movie theater in Austin right now.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.440
Maybe I would still judge that.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.240
I think that's wise.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:29.000
So anyway, Alex is cranky about this trip to the globalist socialist movie theater to

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.440
see a brainwashing film.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:37.480
The only way to deal with that is to have a couple of news reporter babies come in.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:37.800
Sure.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.360
These two dicks.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:46.280
So it's Tom Papert and Patrick Howley, and they both work at National File, and they

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:52.120
are just like, I can't look at them and not think that they're babies dressed up like

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:52.600
adults.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.080
They just strike me as like, I don't know.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.920
The suits don't fit too well.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.840
They've got shoulder pads on.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:07.640
And they have these sort of skills and presentation of, I don't know, like, debate team

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.240
junior high kids.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.760
Like, it's just outrageous.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:14.200
At the end of the performance, they both step away from their chairs.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.320
One of them gets on the other's shoulders, and they put their big trench coat on and

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:17.880
walk out.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:18.200
Yeah.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:25.480
And they're like, Tom's a little bit beefy, and Patrick Howley seems like a little squirrely

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.120
guy.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.880
And they're Laurel and Hardy-ing it.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:28.440
Oh, boy.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:33.400
The team of them, and realizing that they work at the same place, it's comical.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.400
I kind of want to write a sitcom about it.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.160
I will not, though.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.680
A nice little workplace comedy about those two evil fucks?

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:46.760
I will just suffer through listening to these two horribly voiced people explain to me how

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.960
Trump can seize power.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:53.720
A sitting US representative in the new Congress that will come in on January 3 needs to have

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.240
in writing a written objection.

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.920
We've got this from Mo Brooks.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.040
That written objection then needs to be mirrored in the Senate.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:04.200
If it is with Tommy Tuberville or any number of people, Rand Paul, I'm looking at you,

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.600
Ted Cruz, looking at you, these are all of our heroes, right?

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.880
Why haven't they agreed to do this?

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:08.680
That's a very good question.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:14.760
Then if they have a senator agree, the two chambers break off and go meet and discuss

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:18.760
the allegations of fraud, what they should do, whether they should strike these electoral

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.920
votes, what the proper thing to do.

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.960
And in all likelihood, Nancy Pelosi's house will say no.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.520
Arizona's Sharpie ballot markers were fine.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.720
That was just how elections were meant to be, according to the founding fathers.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.840
Meanwhile, if the Republicans have a spine, which we'll see if that happens, that's the

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.920
big question, they'll come back and say, no, Arizona must be thrown out.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:43.800
It's then entirely up to Vice President Mike Pence as the presiding officer of the joint

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:44.920
session of Congress.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:47.640
He gets to decide what to do with that information, Alex.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:52.040
So Mike Pence can say, all right, I'm siding with the Senate on this one.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.920
We're going to toss out Arizona.

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:55.960
He can do that.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:00.680
Or Pence can do the safe thing, the expected thing.

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.760
And he can say, there's no agreement.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:05.320
I do not want to cast a tie-breaking vote.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.560
Therefore, Arizona stands.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:11.640
I think the founding fathers would go ahead and throw out all the votes from non-whites

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.120
and women.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.480
I don't think they would worry too much about this election at all.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:19.400
Trump would have won in a landslide if the founding fathers had anything to say about

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:19.560
it.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.360
Their definition of white might not be what yours is.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.600
It might be a little different.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.320
If we go by the founding fathers definition of votes, maybe 5 million would have been

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:30.120
cast this year?

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:30.440
Yeah.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.200
Bad news, Italians and Irish.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:32.920
You can't vote.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:36.920
Oh, God.

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:37.080
Yeah.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.320
So that was Sharpies.

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:39.880
Yeah.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.000
Get the fuck out of here.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.440
I will tell you this.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:48.440
If they find some Byzantine way where they're like, no, no, technically, I mean, I'm sorry,

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:53.880
but according to legal code 206.C54, Trump is going to be president for the next four

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.280
years.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.880
I'm going to start a war by myself.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:56.600
By myself.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.960
It'll be a war against...

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.840
A Byzantine code rule.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.160
Yeah, it's not going to fly.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.080
This is just fan service.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.040
Yeah, exactly.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:13.320
So if this happened the way that Papert is discussing here, these objections would have

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:17.800
to be brought up in the January 6th joint session of Congress, and then it would require

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.200
a senator and representative to have signed on.

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:24.520
Then each house would meet separately and debate the matter.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:30.440
So each objection, each state would have to have an objection with a senator and a

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.640
representative signed on, and then they'd each have to be debated.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.520
We call on the right honorable senator from Kentucky.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:37.400
Yes.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.760
Do you believe in reality?

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:39.560
No?

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.160
Next person.

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:45.640
So each house of Congress would then vote, and they would require a simple majority for

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.240
the objection to stand.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.760
The objections would literally never pass the house, so you could just forget about

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.160
that.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:56.360
And it seems nearly impossible for me to imagine that it would end up in a 50-50 tie in the

01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:01.720
Senate, which would be the only time when Mike Pence's vote would matter, because the

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:08.440
only instance there would be like, okay, it's possible if both Democrats win in the Georgia

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.480
runoff election.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.040
Sure.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:15.560
Then the vote in the Senate goes down strictly party lines, then we get to a 50-50.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.880
But that seems super unlikely.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:22.440
I find it really difficult to believe, even as craven and ghoulish as some of these GOP

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:26.600
Congress people are, I can't imagine Mitt Romney voting along that line.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.440
No, well, they just heard my threat.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.760
Rand Paul can't even debate me.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.480
Imagine if I started my own war against all of them.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.320
No, I think Rand Paul would go along with it.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.520
Yeah, no, I agree with that.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:43.080
I don't think that Mitt Romney would...

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:49.400
There's a number of GOP senators that I don't think are secure enough in their position

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.400
that they would go along with this.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.880
I think even McConnell's a toss up.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.880
Oh, he's too much of a craven dickwad.

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.360
If he thought he could win, he'd win.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.560
But he couldn't.

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:02.120
If he thought he would lose, he'd find some way to screw somebody else.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:02.920
But you couldn't.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:07.880
Even if you do this and you somehow get the objection to stand in the Senate, it still

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.000
doesn't stand in the House.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.360
It doesn't matter.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:14.120
These statutes are really clear that in order for things like this to fly, there needs to

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.680
be agreement in both houses of Congress.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:21.240
When there's an alternative slate of electors offered from each state in the House, they

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:26.280
disagree on which to accept, quote, the statute states that the votes of the electors whose

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:30.040
appointment was certified by the governor of the state shall be counted.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:35.160
The only outcome this is going to result in is like they're just going to draw this shit

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.320
out, like the process is just going to get dragged out.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:42.200
They're going to stall any government operation and they're going to further radicalize and

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.080
agitate the right wing elements who just can't accept that Trump lost.

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:49.080
Tom Papert's out here creating this fantasy world for them to all live in.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:53.480
And then when that world does not materialize, it's just going to drive the audience deeper

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:57.800
into the hole of resentment and insisting that the system is broken and can't be fixed.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:03.240
Like if these magical fantasy plans don't work, what hope does the actual process have?

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:03.960
We're screwed.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.800
That's all that's going on here.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:08.600
Draw it out.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.560
Drag it out.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:15.720
Yeah, the problem is once you've exhausted all of your magical plans, then everybody

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:21.000
who's believed that the magical plans could happen eventually has to go, nothing we do

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:21.800
works.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.800
We have to do something different.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:31.000
And usually the thing that they think to do different is not like, let's get into actually

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.320
organizing, community building.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:39.480
And that's because they don't ask, why are we always losing?

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.520
Because they already know the answer.

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:42.520
Can't be because the plans are magical.

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.560
No, can't be that.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.280
It has to be because these people are so evil.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:49.480
They won't even follow the rules that we're, we're the good guys.

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.120
We're trying to follow the rules and they won't.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.200
It's not that we're full of shit.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:54.520
Nope.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:54.840
Yep.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:55.560
Certainly not.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:59.480
So, so that's Tom Papert coming in with his magical Mike Pence plan.

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.040
Love it.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.920
And then we get Patrick Hawley also on the call.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:03.560
All right.

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.400
Just like really being a shithead.

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:09.480
Well, Alex, first of all, I want to make clear because I just got a text.

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:14.360
You know, nobody's considering replacing Mike Pence in the short term as a strategy, but

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:17.720
mark my words that was looked into that was researched.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.600
Absolutely.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.680
No one has a free pass.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:24.600
If they're going to go against president Donald Trump, president Donald Trump is the Republican

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.160
party.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:29.480
President Donald Trump is this movement and the American people are desperate to keep

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.200
them in here.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:35.720
So actually I looked into this a little bit and I found a mission statement for Patrick

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.760
Hawley's politics.

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:37.000
Sure.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.680
Um, there is no loyalty except loyalty to Donald Trump.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.000
There's no love except love for Donald Trump.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.520
There is no laughter except the laugh of triumph over Antifa.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.840
There is no art, no literature, no science.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.640
When we are omnipotent, we shall have no more need for science.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:54.600
There'll be no distinction between beauty and ugliness.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.720
There'll be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.960
All competing pleasures will be destroyed, but always do not forget this Winston.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:05.400
There will always be the intoxication of power constantly increasing.

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:06.280
You get where I'm going.

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:12.440
Dude, get a, get a, get a job that does do something good.

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.720
Become a bricklayer.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.600
Do something good with your life instead of writing that.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.400
Sweat a little bit.

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:17.880
Just do something.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.080
He didn't actually write that.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:30.520
I mean, it's spiritually in line with, uh, so, uh, Patrick Hawley's a little bit too

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:31.400
like obvious.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.120
Here's what's going to happen on January 6th.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:39.560
It's great independent media like Tom and Alex Jones are going to show the world in

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:45.160
real time, all of the evidence that the courts have not been making public to the people

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.080
and the Supreme court won't even hear.

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:52.360
And I know Matt Gates is going to fight and I know we can drag it out for hours upon hours

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:56.280
upon hours and create a maximum pressure scenario.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:01.320
And that's why what we're doing is going to really make an impact.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:04.040
So that was showing a few too many cards.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:08.840
Patrick Hawley knows that the only thing they're going to achieve is this big dumb dumb publicity

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:13.240
stunt and they're going to extend the process by however long they can to maximize profits.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:18.200
Unfortunately, according to the US code, each objection that gets made is limited to two

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:22.760
hours of debate with no Congress person being allowed more than five minutes to speak or

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:23.880
question the matter.

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.240
You can do the math if you want, but according to the law, there's only so much they can

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.680
drag this way.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.280
So good luck.

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:32.760
Enjoy dumb Jesus.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:41.000
So Alex wants Tom and Pat to close things out by explaining, Hey, who are them globalists?

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:41.320
All right.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.920
And in my note, I just have here, these people are fucking nuts.

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:45.420
Okay.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.040
30 seconds or one minute each.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.520
How would you describe in one minute, Papert the globalist?

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.960
Well, what you started to say is accurate.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:58.360
It's a collection of psychopaths who have figured out that they can leverage blackmail,

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:03.960
extortion, bribery, everything you can get to keep a seat in power, no matter what country

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.080
is the global hegemon.

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.520
If it's the United States, that's great.

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:08.040
If it's China, who cares?

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.320
I think that that is the globalist.

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.280
They are power drunk.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:14.840
They are sick and they don't, they have no loyalties to anything but power.

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.480
Well, they might have loyalty to ball, to a malloc.

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:17.880
That's true.

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.600
And you know, these are, these are baby killing Satanists.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.320
They are overseeing a genocide of little babies.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.200
They're sick people.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.480
They have a religion.

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:28.840
They believe that they're, you know, descended from the Nephilim bloodlines.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.920
It's a satanic Luciferian cult.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:31.420
Wow.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.800
I just don't understand.

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:37.080
Yeah.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:37.800
Just don't.

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.120
Our enemies believe that they're descended from the Nephilim.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:42.600
It's not.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.920
No, they don't.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.040
They don't.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:46.520
Wow.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.800
They don't exist.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.760
You just don't know about what they talk about behind closed doors.

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.720
They don't exist.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.240
Really say that out loud.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:53.640
Nephilim bloodlines.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.920
Say that out loud.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:58.360
Our enemies believe they're descended from the Nephilim.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:11:59.000
Okay.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.120
The biblical giants.

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:00.360
Bye.

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:01.640
Bye.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:02.360
Goodbye.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.000
Yep.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.400
Goodbye, Tom Papert and Patrick Cowley.

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:09.880
You have comported yourself exactly how one would expect, which is not well.

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:10.440
Yeah.

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.480
So, um, Alex-

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.720
Go try and steal booze from somebody.

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:17.080
Two toddlers wearing a goddamn fucking, ugh.

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:21.400
Alex has a really important like sort of structural public service announcement that I think is

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:25.400
actually really, really key for the Infowarriors to take to heart.

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.560
Brother, I absolutely agree with you.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:31.240
And we have to physically not support the big globalist chains.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.000
Sometimes we still will be forced to.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.080
We have to physically support mom and pops.

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.920
You have to understand it's a war.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:42.920
Didn't you go see Wonder Woman at a socialist globalist movie theater on opening weekend?

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:45.080
Look, Alamo Drafthouse isn't a huge chain.

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.320
It's not AMC or anything like that.

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:48.920
I think you're supporting mom and pop.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:53.800
I mean, obviously mom and pop evil globalist socialists, but you know, there's still room

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:55.800
for that small business globalism.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.360
Opening weekend, movie I hate.

01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.240
Great.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:06.200
So Alex goes back to calls and this caller actually brings up what I would say is a good

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:06.600
point.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.080
It's a logical extension of a lot of Alex's ideas.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:09.800
All right.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:16.680
I'd love to see in the future your show maybe focus on, or a new show maybe focus on how

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:22.600
we start setting up new systems and societies to get outside of the mainstream society and

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:27.320
What you're saying is 100% the answer.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:33.080
We should all just be focusing on communities, neighborhoods, towns, organizations, free

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:37.800
association groups where we want a pro-human future, where we want traditional values,

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:43.560
where we honor life, where we honor children, where we honor goodness, because they've

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.960
overtaken the churches and control most of those.

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:50.280
And so we need something that I don't even use the word secular, but something that's

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:53.000
just human and saying, we reject death.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.080
We reject the wages of the new world order.

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:55.560
God bless you.

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.600
And I appreciate your call.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:56.760
Yeah.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:00.760
So I mean, this caller is essentially bringing up like, Hey, why don't we talk more about

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:01.960
setting up some communes?

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:03.560
You know what?

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:07.640
We should, we should set up those communes, but that does sound a lot like what the dirty

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:09.320
globalists want to do.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:09.640
Shit.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.000
We're stuck.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.960
Our imaginary enemies have solutions that we don't like because they're also, God damn

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:16.120
it.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:19.800
We have to make a rural autonomous zone as opposed to autonomous zones in cities.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.400
Yeah, completely different.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:28.680
So Joel Skousen shows up and, uh, the, the conversation about this dumb elector plan

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:34.760
that Tom Papert was pitching earlier, uh, comes up and, and I'll say to Skousen's credit,

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.120
he doesn't go in for that bullshit.

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.240
He thinks it's a dumb plan.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.720
It's going to be very easy to block.

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:43.160
It doesn't matter how many people are in favor of the Trump electors.

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.240
All it takes is two or three to block.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.960
And I think that's, what's going to happen in the Senate.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.240
Is there any path to victory now for Trump?

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.200
Disrespectful.

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.040
Eating a little bit.

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:54.920
Disrespectful.

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.120
Eating a little bit.

01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:56.600
Yeah.

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:57.560
Having a little bite.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:02.920
So I will say that Skousen is, I will tip my hat to him in terms of him, you know, saying

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.360
that this plan is dumb.

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:05.400
Yes.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:10.840
I will retract my hat at this point when he starts talking about, there was that story

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.160
that was going around about, uh, uh, John Roberts, chief justice of the Supreme Court,

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.160
yelling about how we can't take up this case.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:17.800
Absolutely.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.440
Um, listen to this idiot.

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:20.760
Okay.

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.640
Listen to this idiot Joel Skousen talk about that story.

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:24.040
All right.

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:25.400
This guy's a fucking idiot.

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:25.640
Okay.

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:32.440
As you know, there was this supposed leak from the Supreme Court, which I'm a little

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:37.080
bit doubtful of stating that John Roberts, you know, had a yelling and screaming session

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:43.480
threatening conservatives into, uh, uh, not taking up the Texas case for fear of rioting

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:44.120
the United States.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.720
If we ever, you know, allow Trump to be reelected.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:53.320
Well, the Supreme Court came out the next day and said, uh, there was no such yelling

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:58.920
match because, uh, the, the, the Supreme Court justice haven't met in person for weeks because

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:01.080
of COVID-19 everything is done by zoom meeting.

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:06.280
But another person had said, well, it's very possible they did meet in person because John

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:10.600
Roberts wouldn't have wanted to put this on zoom, which is not a secure form of communications.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.520
It could have been tapped and leaked to the American people what he was saying on that.

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:20.680
So I think there's good arguments in both cases, but this much, I do know Alex, that

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:23.400
John Roberts is a controlled individual by the deep state.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:23.880
Of course.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:29.000
And he did in fact, and would in fact always vote against Trump to make sure he's not reelected.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.280
What a fucking idiot.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.160
All right.

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:35.720
So, uh, I, I doubt this story even happened.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.000
Great start.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:37.400
Okay.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.160
Great start to launch this ship.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:44.440
And they told me that it didn't happen because the only zoom meetings have happened for weeks.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.760
Um, my rebuttal to that is what if they did?

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:49.260
Yeah.

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:51.160
Whoa.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:51.480
Yeah.

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:52.200
That's a good one.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:52.920
Skousen.

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.600
What if instead of the thing that's real, they did the thing that I say?

01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:00.120
Skousen, I'm going to fucking subscribe to your newsletter, man.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.000
You were killing it.

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.040
Fucking that level of reasoning is being brought to this.

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:06.680
What if?

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:07.160
All right.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:12.600
Now I know the sun rose yesterday, but what if it didn't, what would we say then?

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:17.560
I would guess that any communication between Supreme court justices is not something that

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.000
anyone would want to leak.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.320
And therefore this meeting would not be different or special from any other meeting.

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:28.840
Any other meeting, if any is being done on zoom, I would assume it's probably a hyper

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.840
secure, special zoom.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.280
It's like the zoom that you and I use.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.160
I would doubt it.

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.120
I would doubt it.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:34.760
Very stupid.

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:37.880
Although very, very stupid reasoning skills.

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:38.920
Very dumb.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.440
Um, analysis.

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:46.600
I will say as we found out when we did our bonus episode over zoom, it's not even possible

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:49.320
for John Roberts to scream at somebody through zoom.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:52.680
It cuts your volume off if you're anywhere near as loud as me.

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.880
That might've been your laptop.

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:54.520
That could be me.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.800
But, uh, it's unclear.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:00.040
So anyway, uh, we're gonna end this episode here and jump to the 29th.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.800
Skousen, who cares?

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.120
You just talked about how you need to live an hour outside of town.

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:05.800
I want to move an hour outside of town.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:10.200
I don't not want to, but I also don't care to hear Skousen talk about it.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.400
So we, uh, we jumped to the 29th here.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.920
This is delightful.

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.520
I find this a lot of fun.

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:21.960
Alex decides to, uh, to kick things off by teasing a little bit, but then he's like,

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:26.200
I'm not going to tell you what I'm teasing about, but it's a little, but it's a little

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:26.760
too obvious.

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:33.000
Now I know some incredible information that I am not at liberty to tell you, but I am

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.360
at liberty to just give you a hint, which I don't think is too hard.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.200
You notice Trump said January 6th will be wild in DC.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.400
Well, it will be wild.

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:50.120
And I can tell you the twilight zone nature of all of this went up to a whole new level

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:52.040
yesterday and I'll leave it at that.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.600
Alex keeps trying to hit the Trump's going to come to the rallies.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:56.200
It's very simple.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:00.600
I love the idea of somebody being like, look, here's some information.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.040
You can't tell anybody that you can hint.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:06.040
Hey, listen, don't give away the information.

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:06.840
Make it a puzzle.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:11.720
This is really serious and you got to be on the up and up about this.

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.600
Now I'm not going to tell you what, how to hint.

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:19.400
I'm not going to give you any lines that you can't cross, but I'm not going to say make

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.080
it too easy or too hard.

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:21.960
I'm not going to say that.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.440
I just want you to put your own spin on it.

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:24.760
Yeah.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.560
All right.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.320
So yesterday's show, the 28th, was kind of disappointing in a lot of ways.

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.600
There wasn't a lot of content.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.280
There's a lot of stupid shit.

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:34.840
Anytime those two dum-dums are on the show, it's bad.

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.640
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:36.840
Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.340
Yeah.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:42.840
And then there's a lot of Wonder Woman complaining and I found it to be uninspired even by Alex

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.240
standards, but there was a problem.

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.160
Did he even talk about Pedro Pascal?

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:47.560
No.

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.000
Because it's amazing.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:49.320
Yeah.

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.040
He's so good.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:50.760
I'm sure he is.

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:51.320
He's amazing.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.920
But look, there was a problem with the show that was structural.

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:55.480
Okay.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.320
It was beyond what I could observe.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:58.840
Okay.

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.920
Let me just kind of calmly explain this.

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:07.560
I got prepared for yesterday's show for several days and then I got so upset after looking

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.800
at all the news and evidence and over preparing.

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:10.600
Watching Wonder Woman.

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:13.240
That I was in such a nasty mood when I started the show yesterday.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.840
Because you watched Wonder Woman.

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.280
Yeah, man, I over prepared.

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:21.000
I just couldn't get my job done because I was too prepared again.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:21.400
Okay.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:21.960
So...

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.560
Constantly over prepared.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:27.560
Whining about Wonder Woman happened because he was too prepared.

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:28.120
Too prepared.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:28.680
Too prepared.

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.160
Okay.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:29.480
All right.

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.440
And angry.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.440
And someone named Diana called in.

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:33.400
Well, then you gotta.

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:33.720
Yeah.

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:34.360
You just gotta.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.360
Look, I don't blame him for that.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.280
I would have done the same in that situation.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.000
And then today he's like, I ought to make good on it.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.280
You know, I had all this over preparation yesterday.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:46.440
Now I must pay off that over preparation.

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.080
All right, here we go.

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.640
So what he decides to do is show off like a baby might.

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:50.440
Whine about Wonder Woman.

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.440
Let me show you just the COVID stacks.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.600
One is from yesterday.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:55.720
Three are from today.

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:57.240
So I have four stacks right here.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.080
Four COVID stacks.

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:01.400
Now look at this stack.

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:02.360
Look at this one.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.640
Look at all these stacks.

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.760
I have so much paper.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:06.920
I've seen...

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:11.320
Look, I've been in the pool hustling game for a while.

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:12.120
I'll tell you right now.

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:15.720
I've seen, I know when somebody has some fake ones.

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:16.040
All right.

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.040
I know what's underneath that role.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.000
I know what's going on.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.120
This is somebody who's like padded an essay to hit the word limit.

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:25.640
That's how it feels.

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.080
Like, oh, look at all this paper.

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.360
I've read all this.

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:32.040
I know you said size 14, but what if I can get away with a size 15?

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.640
That's one less word per page.

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.040
Yeah.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:34.360
Yeah.

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:39.720
It's so much a desperate attempt to trick people into thinking he's prepared at all

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:41.720
because it visually looks like he might have.

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:43.640
There's so much paper out here.

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:49.960
I would be more impressed if he had nothing, but it's all just a magic trick.

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:56.600
Anyway, Alex, apparently the story is another level of deep COVID denialism that again was

01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:00.280
like the kind of thing that I just had to walk away from, breathe a little bit and just

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.560
be like, oh, fuck you, man.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.760
So again, they're like, oh, we're turning people away.

01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:11.720
Well, that's like saying one restaurant is full, but there's 10 more next door that aren't.

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.240
That's how they statistically manipulated.

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.920
But I don't just, I'm not just going to tell you that.

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:20.920
We're going to show you where you can go directly into the CDC's own numbers and see what every

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:25.560
hospital in your town or city has because the COVID cases are all reported because they're

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.800
all incentivized to call it COVID to get money.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.600
And most of these people don't even need to be in the hospital.

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:37.400
But Travis County is at, as of last night, 9% COVID capacity.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:48.120
There are 77 people in hospitals in Austin, in Travis County, that supposedly have COVID.

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:53.720
We're talking millions of people, 77 in the hospital.

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:57.400
Alex is desperately trying to spin the news stories that have been coming out about how

01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:01.880
hospitals are going to have to start talking about rationing care because they can't handle

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.680
the load of patients with the surge of COVID-19 cases.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:09.160
Obviously, this is something that people have been warning about for a long time, and everything

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:13.080
Alex has stood for has been the exact things that people warned would cause the need to

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.720
ration care and turn people away from hospitals.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:19.800
The fact that we've reached the point we have should be a sign that people like Alex Jones

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:24.040
have been a cancerous influence on the public information space and that his recommendations

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:26.760
have led exactly where everyone knew they would.

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:30.760
So it's super important for him to act like all this is imaginary or something.

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:34.680
The way he chooses to do it is by covering the story like a fifth grader doing a book

01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:37.640
report about a novel he's only pretending to have read.

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:41.080
There's a couple of details that he got from reading the back cover that he's hitting really

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:43.560
hard in order to fake like he knows what he's talking about.

01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:49.560
A December 28 article in the Austin Statesman reported that the ICU occupancy in Travis

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:53.160
County rose 62% in just the previous week.

01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:59.160
The county has a maximum ICU availability of 200 patients and they were at 132 on Monday

01:23:59.160 --> 01:23:59.960
night.

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:05.800
There were 422 hospitalizations in the county linked to COVID-19 as of the time of the writing

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:06.600
of that article.

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:10.600
I was trying to get a sense of what Alex would possibly be talking about because the numbers

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:14.280
that he's using are just completely out of sync with anything I can find reported anywhere.

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:19.000
I looked at the Austin COVID-19 surveillance dashboard and I think I figured out where

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.680
he got the 77 number from.

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:25.000
I think that was the number of people listed as on ventilators at the time that he looked

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.200
at the data.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.920
By December 31st that number was up to 81 but it seems like the number could have possibly

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:33.160
be close to what he was saying at the time that he read it.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:38.120
And I actually found a Statesman article from earlier this week that cited that the number

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:44.840
of people on ventilators was 77 in Austin on Monday when this episode was recorded so

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:45.880
I'm pretty sure that's what he's...

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.080
That sounds about right, yeah.

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:52.520
Yeah, what's outrageous about this, if this is what he's going off of, like this

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:57.240
misinterpretation, is that right next to the ventilator number on the COVID-19 dashboard

01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:02.040
is the hospitalized figure in twice as large a font which is much higher.

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:07.400
If Alex actually had looked to find these numbers it would be literally impossible for

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:10.120
him to miss that one and see the other one.

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.560
It kind of heavily implies that either he's just repeating something that someone told

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:18.200
him which is inaccurate or he's willfully passing along inaccurate information in order

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:22.920
to minimize the public health risk posed by COVID-19 which stands a very good chance of

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.440
getting extra people killed.

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:29.400
I mean, well, I mean he just saw Wonder Woman so whenever he read that his brain was all

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:29.800
messed up.

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.760
He thought that the smaller number was the only number that you could see.

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.120
That's what happens with Wonder Woman.

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:34.680
Is that right?

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:36.360
Yeah, you can't see large numbers anymore.

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:36.760
Shit.

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.360
Yeah, I know, it's a real bummer.

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:38.760
Fuck.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:42.520
Write something bigger than 16-point font and I cannot read it.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:42.920
Oh no.

01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:44.040
Yeah, I know, it's brutal.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:48.760
Also in terms of deaths, the city of Austin put out a press release on December 30th announcing

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:52.920
that COVID-19 was the third highest cause of death this year behind only cancer and

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:54.120
heart disease.

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:57.160
The number is at least 548 this year.

01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:59.560
If you do a little bit of math, that's north of one a week.

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:05.240
Also, I know it's not possible, but I wish you would just stop doing stuff like this.

01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:10.760
It's so much more fun when it's Wonder Woman, Illuminati symbols, and fake Jefferson quotes.

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:12.440
It sucks.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:13.960
It blows me away.

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:22.040
I understand it because I have never been able to just light $20,000 on fire whenever

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:27.800
I wanted to, but it never fails to surprise me what people will be convinced is enough

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.880
to corrupt somebody.

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:36.840
This whole, like, oh, they get an extra 20 grand out of, it says COVID in an ICU and

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.680
it's like, that's nothing.

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:43.000
The people that you are describing as being the evil billionaires that are destroying

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.480
everything would fucking put $20,000 under their shoes just to feel like what it's, to

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:50.120
step on money.

01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.200
It is nothing.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:56.600
But there's a secondary conversation even past that, that that money that's being discussed

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.360
isn't like some kind of a bonus.

01:26:58.360 --> 01:26:59.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.600
It's payment for care.

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:01.000
Yeah.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.360
Like it's Medicare payments.

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:03.000
Yeah.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.800
So like, do you think that people who have other things don't also have payments attached

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:09.240
to them like a heart attack?

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.400
Do you think that maybe might be more?

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:12.200
No, no, no, no.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:16.040
If you go in for a cough and you have a heart attack, they still only pay for the cough.

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:19.400
They're not giving people bonuses just for having a heart attack in the hospital, Dan.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:24.200
He's imagining that like this number is zero for other things and then, oh, we incentivize.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:26.360
It's just so stupid.

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.000
It's pathetic.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.480
But yes, that number is also like really big to people like us.

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:31.960
Yeah, no.

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:35.320
And comically small to people like Bezos.

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:39.880
It's one of those things that it's hilarious to me whenever people are like, oh, man, your

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:43.480
House of Representatives make like $140,000 a year.

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:46.520
And it's like, yes, I know that's a lot of money to you and me.

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:51.960
But to the oligarchs who own them, they can shit out $140,000 every five seconds.

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:54.520
Like it is so little.

01:27:54.520 --> 01:28:03.560
The real scale of corruption that we are existing in is world like the country is what corruption

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:08.520
where like somebody could be like, okay, I will corrupt you if you own Sudan now.

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:12.040
Like that's the level of billionaire evil corruption we're dealing with.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.360
I think I get what you're saying in terms of scale.

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:14.920
Yeah.

01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:16.120
So I thought that was bad.

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:23.000
I thought that Alex is claiming that 77 people are hospitalized with COVID-19 in Travis County,

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.360
which is demonstrably not true and very, very bad.

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:27.240
I thought that was bad.

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:29.000
But then this is worse, I think.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.320
We've got Kyle Rittenhouse's mother.

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.880
No, no.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:39.000
She did her first interview yesterday with Owen Schroyer.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:39.960
I was like up here working.

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:42.040
I was like, wow, she's got a lot to say.

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.800
I haven't seen her on TV and they're like, no, this is, I think, her first interview.

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:50.920
So she'll be joining us with her lawyer about the incredible persecution of the Rittenhouses.

01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:53.640
That's a beta test for the rest of us in the third hour.

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:54.440
Oh boy.

01:28:54.440 --> 01:29:00.280
So whenever that does end up happening, Alex cannot stop saying We Are All Kyle Rittenhouse.

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:00.840
Jesus.

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.120
It's very uncomfortable.

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.080
That's not good.

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:04.280
No, it's a bad interview.

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:07.240
And we'll get to a little bit of it to end this episode.

01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:13.160
We Are All Murderers, however, is something that I would say that Alex is correct on.

01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:13.480
Spiritually.

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:15.160
If that's what he's describing, yeah.

01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:20.280
So we got to get back to this hospital hoax first though, that Alex is going to blow the lid off.

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:20.520
Great.

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:24.280
Man, this guy is an in-depth journalist.

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:33.080
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to lay out for you the absolute proof of total criminal

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:40.760
fraud by the hospitals, by the media, by the CDC, because they go on the news and they

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:43.000
say, we've got to lock down the economy.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.760
You can't leave your house for a few months.

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:47.960
We're going to have 2.5 million dead in just a few months.

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:52.280
The hospitals are already overwhelmed and the people went to the very hospitals.

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.800
You saw the hundreds of videos.

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:54.040
Yeah.

01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:57.720
I remember when everybody took pictures of parking lots and pretended that no one was

01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:58.360
at the hospital.

01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.000
Yeah, I remember that.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.160
You guys are all dogged industrial.

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:01.480
Yeah.

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.560
So Alex rambles about nonsense for a bit.

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.240
I'm like, what are you actually talking about?

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:06.440
And he finally gets down to it.

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:08.520
And it was an article in NPR that he found.

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:08.840
Sure.

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:13.800
Federal data reveals which hospitals are dangerously full this week is yours.

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:19.160
And then you link to the federal government CDC website from in PR, but they know you're

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:19.880
not going to link through.

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:25.560
No, you know, you know, federal shows you've got a billion dollars in your bank account,

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:26.360
but you really don't.

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:31.240
We have federal data reveals which hospitals are dangerously full.

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:32.520
This week is yours.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:37.000
So what's going on here is that Alex is upset about an article he didn't read in NPR, where

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.040
they had some links that I guess he's certain no one followed.

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:44.120
I'm certain that Alex didn't do any original research on this, nor do I believe that he

01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:47.800
went and looked at the raw data because I'm certain he would be unable to read the Excel

01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:48.520
spreadsheet.

01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:51.240
It's a lot of it's a lot of rows.

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:51.880
Yeah.

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:56.680
He's talking about the data visualization that NPR posted, which does show that Travis

01:30:56.680 --> 01:31:00.600
County has 9% of its known inpatient beds used for COVID patients.

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:04.680
The problem with that stat on its own is that it's meaningless.

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:09.320
For instance, if Alex looked a little bit deeper into the data, he'd see that nine out

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:12.680
of 15 Austin hospitals are not included in the data set.

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:15.080
So it's a little incomplete in terms of getting the full picture.

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:16.120
Well, that's a struggle.

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:20.760
But even beyond that, the problem isn't that all the beds are being taken up by COVID patients.

01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:24.920
It's that with a rise in COVID patients, the hospitals will reach their capacity and have

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.560
no beds left for anybody else who might need treatment.

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:32.040
That's why a more than surface level analysis of this data is important.

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:36.600
So let's take St. David's Medical Center in Austin as an example.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:41.400
They show 7% of their adult inpatient beds being taken up for COVID patients.

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:42.600
That seems like nothing.

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:43.880
A drop in the bucket at 7%.

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:50.120
However, if you look at the next column, you'll see that 93% of their total adult inpatient

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.320
beds are occupied.

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:55.080
So any increases in COVID patients would be a disaster for them.

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.880
You see this in many of the included Austin hospitals.

01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:04.360
Ascension Seton Medical Center has 13% of its beds taken by COVID patients, but 90%

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:05.880
total occupied.

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:11.160
Dell Seton Medical Center at UT Austin has 23% of its beds taken by COVID patients, but

01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:13.560
94% are occupied total.

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:20.600
For North Austin Medical Center, 10% are COVID patients, but 94% total are occupied.

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:24.120
This is the pattern that is the important piece.

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:28.600
The concern is definitely partially that there are a lot of COVID patients that need to be

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:33.000
treated, but the larger picture has to take into account that hospitals have a certain

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.080
capacity, and even beyond that, they only have a certain amount of human attention that

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.760
can be provided to patients.

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:43.240
You can't magically create doctors and nurses in a 3D printer, so even if you add a ton

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:48.760
of beds, or put patients who should be in the ICU in non-ICU beds, it's not like that

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:50.600
part of the equation can be balanced out.

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:55.720
This is the sort of context that Alex deprives his audience of, because he thinks that he

01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:58.920
is a slam dunk with the optics of this 9% statistic.

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:04.040
He can yell that 9% all he wants, but it doesn't change the reality that it's far more complex

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:06.200
than surface level faked book reports.

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:06.760
Yeah.

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:09.160
I feel like I might be saying this a lot, but this shit's disgraceful.

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:11.720
Like, it's just, it's infantile bullshit.

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:17.960
This elevator has 100 people on it, and there's only an increase in 9% of COVID patients

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:18.840
adding to the elevator.

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:24.360
I mean, sure, the maximum capacity is 50, and the elevator's going to fall, and everyone's

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.320
going to die.

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.040
Well, it's only 9.

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:29.000
But you can fit an extra 9% in there.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:35.800
It's interesting when you either willfully or are unable to understand the complexities

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.280
of things, and then you gloat about it.

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.000
Yeah.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.840
So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:45.880
St. David's is at 7% capacity.

01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:50.680
Uh-oh, St. David's South Austin Medical Center is at 20% capacity.

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:55.240
Uh-oh, Ascension Seton.

01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:57.480
Oh, no, this one.

01:33:58.440 --> 01:33:59.720
They're at 13%.

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:00.840
Oh, no, we're all dead.

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:02.760
You average together 9% capacity.

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:05.080
Again, those are the hospitals that we just discussed.

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:09.880
It's not, he's not taking into account the larger picture, and he's gloating about missing

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:13.560
the point, which is kind of, like, exactly what Alex does.

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:14.280
I mean, it's perfect.

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:19.080
I'm going to cut out this next clip because it's pointless, but I just thought it was

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:23.080
pretty funny that Alex claims that he fact-checked Johns Hopkins.

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:23.880
All right.

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:24.520
All right, Alex.

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:25.960
I just thought that was really funny.

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.680
Get the fuck out of here.

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:29.400
Alex sitting there with, like, bifocals on, like, what?

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:30.200
Hold on.

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:36.440
Yeah, using my CPA, I've gone through and taken care of Johns Hopkins' numbers.

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:40.200
I just thought that was really funny, just the mental image of it, but it pales in comparison

01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:42.040
to how excited I got when I heard this clip.

01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:42.840
Okay.

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:43.800
So there's facts.

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:48.680
Now, I haven't hit the latest, the actual UN document where they admit it's all a hoax,

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:51.880
and for power and control, bigger than the great reset.

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.480
It was first in a Canadian document.

01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:56.440
They tried to say, well, we're not sure what's real, but we were able to search the document

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:59.320
and find other documents from other countries that confirm it is real.

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:02.120
We have you now.

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:02.920
We'll be back.

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:04.840
Hour number two, straight ahead.

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.520
This is the Info War.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.400
God damn, he's so excited.

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.000
I am pumped.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.440
We have you now.

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.160
Yeah.

01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:13.800
You better...

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:14.520
He got him.

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:17.320
You better fucking follow through on We Have You Now.

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:18.040
Dude, he got him.

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:18.600
You have...

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:22.200
If you have them now, you better now have them.

01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:23.160
You know me pretty well.

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:24.760
You know that's something that gets me excited.

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:26.280
When Alex drops something like that on my lap.

01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:26.920
We have them now.

01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:27.800
It's a document.

01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:29.640
We have them now, not later.

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:31.400
We're not going to get them soon.

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.920
Now is when we have them.

01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:33.960
Yeah, but we'll get back to that.

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:34.680
All right.

01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:35.480
Because Alex...

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:36.600
See, but we have them now.

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:37.640
We should be getting to it now.

01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:39.720
You can't get back to something that we have now.

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:41.560
There's more important things going on.

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:42.520
We have them.

01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:43.160
Nope.

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:43.480
Okay.

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:45.640
There's Epstein.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:46.040
Mariam.

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:48.840
I should have known.

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:49.800
He had a cellmate.

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:50.840
I should have guessed.

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.600
And that cellmate just died of COVID.

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:53.000
Sure.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.120
And now this is a conspiracy.

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.160
Now it's a conspiracy.

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:57.880
Epstein liked to read a lot and he kept himself.

01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:00.520
He wasn't a problem starter or too loud.

01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:02.440
My uncle said he was a good cellmate.

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:10.200
His niece said the Daily News reports that Reyes was transferred to a private prison

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:13.960
the day before Epstein hanged himself in August 2019.

01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:17.320
And it was there that he contracted the coronavirus.

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:24.280
Oh, so he was found dead in his apartment and they're telling you it was coronavirus.

01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:26.680
Let me tell you who else died of COVID-19.

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.920
Please pull up the Sir Bruder film, please.

01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:30.520
That's right.

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:35.960
Little did you know, but the coronavirus COVID-19 got in the time machine and went back to Dallas.

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:43.160
I think he thought of that bit before he realized that the cellmate wasn't there when Epstein died.

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:43.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:45.640
I think he found that out on air.

01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:46.140
Yeah.

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:52.040
I could sense a really strong, like, oh, damn it.

01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:53.240
Oh, shit.

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.400
I thought this was the person I was going to pin the murder on.

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:56.680
Really going to be great.

01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:57.800
Really going to be great.

01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:58.300
Yeah.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.960
Alex hasn't got the memo from Trump's lawyer tweeting about Epstein being still alive, too.

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:05.720
What's going on here?

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:06.520
Oh, God.

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:09.720
Anyway, I'm going to cut out this whole part, too.

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:13.640
I just, I have no patience for it right now, and it's not important.

01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:15.240
I can just tell you what happened.

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:15.740
Okay.

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:20.760
Ivan Reichlin, the guy who hung out with Michael Flynn Jr. at the CPAC meeting.

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:21.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:25.000
And apparently was working with some kind of a search engine startup.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:25.720
Hey, they're great.

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:27.240
Very confusing stuff.

01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:33.480
He is on, and his argument for Alex is that Trump needs to immediately take over the emergency alert system.

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:35.000
Okay, that'll do it.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.600
Then we'll all understand.

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:45.640
And he needs to start, I guess, like broadcasting to people and explaining like the election was stolen over their phones or something.

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:54.440
It's unclear the specifics of what they want Trump to do, but it involves taking over technology in a way that's like usually just for tornadoes.

01:37:54.440 --> 01:38:00.520
You know, judging by the number of times it came up in cartoons when I was growing up,

01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:06.360
I assumed you would be able to solve most anti-reality problems with a frying pan to the side of the head.

01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:09.560
You know? Like, if this happened, if somebody says something like that.

01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:10.760
It'll get you back into reality.

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.920
Yeah, it'll get hit him with a frying pan and all of a sudden he's like,

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.680
whoo, good thing I don't think that shit anymore.

01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:15.720
Ooh, sorry about that.

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:16.280
My bad.

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:16.780
Yeah.

01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:17.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:18.520
Uh, yeah.

01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:22.200
I don't know if I can endorse a frying pan, but I would like-

01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:24.680
Only if it brings people back into reality.

01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:25.800
Well, I got-

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:26.520
A magical frying pan.

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:27.480
I need to ask you this, though.

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:28.200
Sure, sure.

01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:31.880
I got the sense that this had something to do with Wonder Woman.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:32.520
Yes.

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:33.020
Does it?

01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:34.140
No.

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:35.800
The lasso of truth?

01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:37.480
No, the plot of the movie.

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:37.980
Oh.

01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:42.600
Like, the electronic alert system idea, there was-

01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:44.360
Yeah, I guess that might be the case.

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:45.000
There was something-

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:45.720
I can see that.

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:48.280
I don't know, like I said, I haven't seen the movie.

01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:51.720
It felt like Alex was hinting at having some connection to Wonder Woman.

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:52.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:55.160
There was a presidential, like,

01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:59.800
we can control and broadcast into every home using this new technology.

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:00.200
Bingo.

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:00.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:01.080
That's it.

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:01.560
Yep.

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:02.600
Okay. Yep, it is.

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:03.000
There you go.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:03.640
It's from the movie.

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:09.080
Yeah, I honestly, I forgot about that part because I don't remember too much of them.

01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:13.400
Anyway, Ivan Reikland wants Alex to get Trump to use that.

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:14.920
Okay, all right.

01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:17.960
The super secret magical broadcast into everybody's home.

01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:19.960
Yes, to save America.

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:22.200
We gotta stop letting these people watch movies.

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.080
Yeah, it would be good.

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.240
All they get to read is Heart of Darkness.

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:25.880
That's it.

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:29.560
Alex, you can't come back to the Alamo Drafthouse.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:33.640
Yeah, you have to wake up every morning to Colonel Kurtz, he dead.

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:34.600
That's what you gotta do.

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:36.520
Mr. Kurtz, sorry.

01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:41.800
We'll jump ahead to this, to Rittenhouse's mom coming in.

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:42.200
Sure.

01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:46.520
Because we've heard Ivan Reikland before, and basically his interview is no more interesting

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:49.720
than Trump should use the emergency alert system to fuck with people.

01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:50.600
That'd be great.

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:51.160
It wouldn't.

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.280
It would be dark.

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:54.780
Yeah.

01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:58.620
Yeah, what if War of the Worlds was the president and also real?

01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:02.300
God, it'd be awful.

01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:03.260
That'd be a nightmare.

01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:08.300
So I feel okay skipping that, because I find myself uninspired by it at the moment.

01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:14.620
I'm uninspired by Kyle Rittenhouse's mom as well, but it seems like something that bears

01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:15.660
discussion.

01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:19.580
Alex is really trying to turn Kyle Rittenhouse into a folk hero.

01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:27.580
We've watched the left burn down apartment buildings and police stations and shoot innocent

01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:29.180
people in the head on the side of the road.

01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:33.660
And we've watched the media tell us that it's mostly peaceful demonstrations.

01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:35.500
And then we saw Kyle Rittenhouse.

01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:36.140
Murder people.

01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:39.420
Who's become a symbol of good people defending themselves.

01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:40.380
A murderer.

01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:42.940
Out there trying to be a medic, trying to help people.

01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:43.740
Murdering people.

01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:45.100
In Kenosha, Wisconsin.

01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:45.740
He's a murderer.

01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:47.820
Being chased down by thugs with guns.

01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:49.260
Oh, he's a white supremacist murderer.

01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:49.660
I forgot about that.

01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:50.620
And defending himself.

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:51.740
Murder?

01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:53.740
And now having the book thrown at him.

01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:54.940
Because he's a murderer.

01:40:54.940 --> 01:41:01.740
I couldn't tell if this interview was prompted by the state tacking on a breaking curfew

01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:06.060
charge, which I even thought was a little like, that's suspicious.

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:06.940
That's a little petty.

01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:10.300
There's got to be a reason, but I can't figure out what it is.

01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:16.380
So they can treat him very nicely and then throw the book at him on that breaking curfew

01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:16.940
charge.

01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:18.220
I'm not entirely sure.

01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:21.180
But I was listening to this and I'm like, I'm going to get mad.

01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:22.460
I don't like this.

01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:24.700
But then I realized I'm not going to get mad.

01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:27.180
I'm going to feel really sad for these people.

01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:29.900
I mean, look, no, I don't.

01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:32.060
But at the same time, I feel gross.

01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:33.020
Maybe that's what I feel.

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:33.340
All right.

01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:33.900
I'm not sure.

01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:35.020
Let's talk to my therapist.

01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:36.140
Figure out exactly what I feel about this.

01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:37.260
Let's find out.

01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:38.620
We need more help, Alex.

01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:41.340
We need everyone to go to FreeKyleUSA.com.

01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:47.980
Kyle was subjected to an outrageous, excessive, unconstitutional $2 million cash bail amount.

01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:49.260
We raised those $2 million.

01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:50.540
We put the cash on the barrelhead.

01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:51.580
We got him free.

01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:52.380
We set him free.

01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:53.420
He's with his family.

01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:55.820
But we need a lot more resources.

01:41:55.820 --> 01:41:58.620
This is going to be a long, hard fight.

01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:02.220
Every American, every Democrat, Republican, independent should care about this because

01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:05.500
they're coming after Kyle Rittenhouse now and they're going to come after you next.

01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:08.220
Let's be clear about that.

01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:12.860
They pick people like Rittenhouse, like Stone, like Jones, like Trump, because I've experienced

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:13.180
it.

01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:14.140
I'm not being a victim here.

01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:14.780
It's just true.

01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:18.140
And then we become like a standard, like the flag that they want to get.

01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:22.140
And then they throw everything they've got at you, the harassment, the lawsuits, the

01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:22.540
lies.

01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:28.780
I mean, like, nothing would be happening to Alex if he didn't commit, like, violations

01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:29.420
against people.

01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:29.980
Yeah, yeah.

01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:35.900
Like, if he didn't defame people, then he wouldn't be getting sued for those things.

01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:42.700
If Kyle Rittenhouse hadn't shot people, or even been at this protest with a gun that

01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:47.580
he shouldn't legally have had, like, there's a number of issues that, you know, like, it's

01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:52.380
not like globalists want to just turn people into symbols or whatever.

01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:58.860
There's actions that precede those lawsuits or arrests that generally are what cause them.

01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:04.460
These fuckers cheer when a black person gets 10 years for weed.

01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:06.380
Fuck them.

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:13.580
I, like, any sympathy that I had where I was like, you know what, it was her son who did

01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:14.140
it.

01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:16.300
She's not directly involved with that.

01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:17.660
I'm not going to blame the mother.

01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:19.500
You know, maybe parenting is an issue.

01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:20.220
I don't know.

01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:21.500
I don't know them personally.

01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:22.300
Infowars.

01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:24.860
Now that is all fucking gone.

01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:25.980
Go fuck yourself.

01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:27.100
You're a murderer too.

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:28.140
I don't give a shit.

01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:32.060
But also this, like, this entire appearance is really just about raising money.

01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:32.620
Yeah, it's disgusting.

01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:35.980
They're constantly going back to the well of like, we need more money.

01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:36.300
Yeah.

01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:37.980
But Alex wants some content.

01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:40.780
He doesn't want her just, like, putting out this message.

01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:42.620
You get money for content.

01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:44.060
You understand the job here.

01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:45.820
Tell me how bad the left is.

01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:47.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:50.460
Has this been a new experience for you to really find out what the left's really like?

01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:53.340
They don't like to be murdered.

01:43:53.340 --> 01:44:03.660
I mean, the left is disgusting, unreal, and you have to be a criminal for them to put

01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:04.860
you on a pedestal.

01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:06.220
My son.

01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:07.260
No, your son's a murderer.

01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:09.180
He's a caring young man.

01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:10.940
And no, he's not.

01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:13.660
They utilize him.

01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:17.740
Then he's a monster, a killer, a murderer.

01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:18.220
Yeah, he is.

01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:25.580
You know, it's just, I'm just so disgusted with it.

01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:27.820
You know, they need to be stopped.

01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:33.260
The internal logic here doesn't work because if the left has turned her son into a criminal

01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:37.180
and a murderer, then they should be putting him on a pedestal based on her saying that

01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:39.340
they take criminals and put them on pedestals.

01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:39.840
Yes.

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.100
Doesn't make sense.

01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:42.540
No, no.

01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:45.740
And we, the left, needs to be stopped.

01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:49.180
Otherwise, Kyle Rittenhouse will continue murdering us.

01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:52.540
Hey, look, I just...

01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:54.000
Fuck them.

01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:56.140
That's, fuck you.

01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:56.860
I agree.

01:44:56.860 --> 01:45:00.860
That's, if you want to say that to me, cool.

01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:02.700
I will let you finish your statement.

01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:04.140
And then I will say, go fuck yourself.

01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:05.580
What if somebody wants to say this?

01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:08.540
New website and everything like that.

01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:15.660
We're selling merchandise from t-shirts, the mugs, I know I'm going to say it, bikinis.

01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:17.120
Yes.

01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:23.420
And a lot of people are disgusted by it, but you know what?

01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:25.420
I don't care.

01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:26.620
Yeah, I got that vibe.

01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:28.700
I got that vibe pretty strong.

01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:34.460
I'm interested to read Kyle's book, If I Did It, Here's How I Would Have Done It.

01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:39.660
Does he get to keep the profits from all of those sales?

01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:44.140
I mean, let's imagine a best case scenario for the rest of his life.

01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:44.640
Yeah.

01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:46.620
Like, just after that night.

01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:49.180
This is not part of it.

01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:52.460
Your mom selling Kyle Rittenhouse bikinis?

01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:52.960
Yep.

01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:57.260
Like, just even, like, take that night in Kenosha out of the equation.

01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:59.820
Imagine your mom selling a bikini with your face on it.

01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:00.460
Jesus.

01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:01.660
That would be years of therapy.

01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:02.540
That'd be great.

01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:03.500
That'd be really great.

01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:05.500
That'd be real great.

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:06.700
It seems gross.

01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:09.440
Jesus.

01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:12.140
Not because it's a bikini.

01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:15.740
I mean, it's just crass, you know?

01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:17.340
Like, it's exploitative.

01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:24.940
Yeah, it's like in Peaky Blinders, whenever the one kid goes to jail and his mom winds

01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:31.820
up sleeping with the corrupt, evil Northern Irish police chief to get him out, and he's

01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:34.380
like, Mom, what did you do?

01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:35.660
What did you do?

01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:40.540
That's infinitely better than if you find out your mom sold your face on a bikini.

01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:43.740
I refuse to believe that Peaky Blinders exists.

01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:44.940
I think it's just a funny name.

01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:45.740
Fantastic.

01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:46.940
It's a great show.

01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:48.300
Cillian Murphy is the best.

01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:52.460
I got this vibe off his mom that really worried me.

01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:56.380
You know, like, laughing about selling bikinis and then getting a little defensive about

01:46:56.380 --> 01:46:56.540
it.

01:46:56.540 --> 01:46:57.020
Yeah.

01:46:57.020 --> 01:46:57.820
Like, all right.

01:46:57.820 --> 01:46:58.380
All right, Ma.

01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:03.580
And then the lawyer comes in and says this, and I got even worse vibes off this dude.

01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:08.300
There has been a long march through the institutions over the past few decades.

01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:13.580
It's very similar to the Maoist revolution in China and the Chinese Communist Party.

01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:14.860
Their tactics are very clear.

01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:17.580
They attempt to destroy everything sacred in a society.

01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:19.900
They attempt to tear down statues.

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:21.900
They try to destroy history.

01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:27.500
They try to destroy our faith in God, and they try to capture the key cultural elite

01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:34.540
institutions such as the media, such as academia, such as the financial institutions, and today

01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:35.580
such as big tech.

01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:38.860
And they've been pretty successful on that front.

01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:43.100
But I'll tell you, Americans are waking up now, and we're going to fight back, and it's

01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:46.140
not going to be pretty for those who are attempting to take our freedom.

01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:49.100
Well, all I can say is amen to that.

01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:51.260
We got one more segment with you guys coming up.

01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:54.940
I don't like the idea that this guy thinks there's a decades-long communist party who

01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:56.380
might not be the best representation.

01:47:56.860 --> 01:48:00.060
Also, I would guess that I would say, are you a lawyer?

01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:11.660
This is like when you're 17, and when you go to college, you need to get a good humanities

01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:15.020
education, and then you can kind of start getting into your specialty, and you're all

01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:16.300
like, nah, I don't need...

01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:18.060
What is all this humanities bullshit?

01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:20.780
My major is pre-law or whatever.

01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:23.900
And it's like, this is why you need a humanities education.

01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:27.500
This is why you need to read anything other than law.

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:28.620
I have to make a confession.

01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:29.100
What's that?

01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:34.460
I didn't actually watch this video, so I can't confirm if this guy is not a robot.

01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:34.940
Oh, okay.

01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:41.100
It's entirely possible he is just animated on screen.

01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:41.900
It's Wall-E.

01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:43.500
Yeah, it's an AI lawyer.

01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:46.140
It's one of those machines.

01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:50.940
Such as big tech, such as media, such as banks.

01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:52.860
Like when an AI writes a screenplay.

01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:55.900
An AI writes a right-wing screed.

01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:57.260
It's the same thing.

01:48:57.260 --> 01:48:58.060
Oh boy.

01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:00.460
So Alex is like, hey, I got a great idea.

01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:01.500
You should work with Barnes.

01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:04.460
Yeah, he breathes really heavy.

01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:05.500
You're a robot.

01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:11.260
No, his idea is like, I don't like these pardons that Trump is throwing around.

01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:11.900
Yes, they're evil.

01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:15.500
But maybe pardon could be used for Kyle Rittenhouse.

01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:16.380
Oh boy.

01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:17.180
That would be...

01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:19.900
This kind of reveals that Alex doesn't understand how pardons work.

01:49:20.540 --> 01:49:25.100
Can the president pardon Rittenhouse before he's convicted?

01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:26.540
And obviously he didn't do anything wrong.

01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:27.420
The law's on his side.

01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:28.700
It's going to be a big fight.

01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:29.500
They're being political.

01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:30.220
They're not dropping it.

01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:35.980
But just hypothetically, could President Trump preemptively pardon Kyle Rittenhouse?

01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:42.620
So Alex, the president's pardoning authorities under the Constitution only

01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:45.580
offend to charges under federal law.

01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:48.300
These are charges under state law in Wisconsin.

01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:53.500
So we are going to need to take this fight to the front lines in Wisconsin.

01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:54.060
Yep.

01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:54.560
Yeah.

01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:55.900
So no.

01:49:57.260 --> 01:50:03.580
Also, any political system where you think it's a good idea to be able to write get out

01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:09.260
of jail free cards, like one free murder cards preemptively, that's a bad system.

01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:09.980
Yeah, no shit.

01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:11.340
You should not support that system.

01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:13.900
Even imagining that system is not good.

01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:14.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:15.840
No.

01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:18.140
So anyway, fuck all these people.

01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:19.980
I'm not going to listen to any more of their interview.

01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:21.180
It's not really that interesting.

01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:25.420
It's just kind of like Alex begging for Kyle to come on once he can talk.

01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:29.260
Once he can speak publicly like, I gotta get this guy a job.

01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:29.740
Wow.

01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:31.100
Might as well be what he's saying.

01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:31.740
Yeah.

01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:35.180
Anyway, Alex has a little bit of time left to kill here at the end of the show.

01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:38.140
No more Wonder Woman thoughts.

01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:41.180
Hmm, although he does get to talk about Bill Gates.

01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:42.300
It turns out Bill Gates.

01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:43.520
Demon.

01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:44.460
Yeah.

01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:45.260
Super demon.

01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:45.760
Sure.

01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:47.900
Genetic super demon.

01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:49.180
I did not know that.

01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:52.860
Now, when you look at Bill Gates, that is a literal super demon.

01:50:52.860 --> 01:50:55.020
A literal super killing machine.

01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:57.020
So is he back in the 12th?

01:50:57.020 --> 01:51:01.180
Celebrations on TV, which with a psycho is what they love to do.

01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:04.220
So many psychos like send letters to the police.

01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:05.020
You'll never catch me.

01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:06.060
You'll never get me.

01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:10.220
Or they'll even tell you what they're going to do to you before they do it.

01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:14.860
And they just hate everyone.

01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:19.180
And it's like a kid pulling the legs off a frog or something, except they do it to people

01:51:19.180 --> 01:51:20.060
in mash.

01:51:20.060 --> 01:51:21.740
And of course, a lot of times it's genetic.

01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:26.140
You know, his dad was clearly a genetic psychotic.

01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:26.640
Oh boy.

01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:29.660
Mark Zuckerberg is a genetic psychopath.

01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:30.460
Oh boy.

01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:34.460
And boy, when I call him a genetic psychopath is he obviously knows, you know, that you

01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:37.020
can look at him and see he's got the chromosome disorder.

01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:37.660
What?

01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:38.300
Several of them.

01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:39.420
He's definitely got the disorder.

01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:42.060
He got so pissed.

01:51:42.060 --> 01:51:45.020
He said the last straw was Jones calling me a genetic psychopath.

01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:51.580
Because that was the protege, the aide, the camp, the apprentice of Bill Gates is right.

01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:53.500
I mean, you know, it's Mark Zuckerberg.

01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:54.380
I mean, they're on record.

01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:55.420
They vacation together.

01:51:55.420 --> 01:51:56.780
They both wear pink sweaters.

01:51:56.780 --> 01:51:58.380
They both wear pink sweaters.

01:51:58.380 --> 01:51:59.500
What more do you need to know?

01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:02.780
I hate this so much.

01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:06.060
I hate you so much.

01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:11.420
I really don't like the idea that Alex has decided that there's a psychopath gene that's

01:52:11.420 --> 01:52:15.500
inheritable among generations and that he can see visually.

01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:16.620
Yeah, yeah.

01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:17.980
I really don't like that.

01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:21.100
You know what's great to hear in 2020?

01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:21.980
Phrenology.

01:52:21.980 --> 01:52:22.300
Yeah.

01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:23.420
That's what you want to hear.

01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:29.180
Yeah, what's really great is magic.

01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:35.180
A lot of people who believe really heavily that things should be talked about in almost

01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:38.700
exclusively genetic terms are cool folks.

01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:39.100
Yeah.

01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:40.140
Yeah, they're super cool.

01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:41.340
Yeah, typically, chill is out.

01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:42.380
Love them.

01:52:42.380 --> 01:52:46.700
So you have one last clip here, and I hate to disappoint, but this is actually a perfect

01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:47.820
last clip for Alex.

01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:52.060
Paul Watson has a lot to cover.

01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:58.460
I only scratched the surface here of the big enchilada today.

01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:02.860
I didn't get to it, and I can't really do justice to this.

01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:03.820
We have them now.

01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:04.700
Now's the time I have.

01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:08.780
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to shoot a special report right after I'm not live.

01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:09.740
We have them now.

01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:11.820
I'm going to take a five minute break.

01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:12.320
Now.

01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:14.300
And have a nice glass of water.

01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:21.420
And then I'm going to go and I'm going to shoot a whole report on this latest event.

01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:22.540
This latest development.

01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:23.340
Great.

01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:27.020
Where you saw a few months ago, they got the Canadian document about the next lockdowns

01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:28.620
coming and then there'll be the strain too.

01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:32.300
And then we'll never unlock things until the communist takeover happens.

01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:33.420
People said, Is this real?

01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:34.560
Yes.

01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:36.700
Look, Alex didn't have time to cover this.

01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:37.900
I don't have time for it either.

01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:39.660
We'll see what happens in the next episode.

01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:40.940
I fucking hate you.

01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:43.180
I hate this so much.

01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:45.100
We've got you now.

01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:47.740
Now is when we've got you.

01:53:47.740 --> 01:53:51.580
And right now I'm going to take care after we get to a couple of different things, listen.

01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:55.900
Look, I got to talk to Ivan Reiklin about how Trump needs to start using tornado alerts

01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:56.860
to take over the country.

01:53:56.860 --> 01:53:57.900
That's how we're going to do it.

01:53:58.620 --> 01:54:00.060
You got to get the message to the people.

01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:04.700
The problem with America, Dan, is not enough people have heard Trump speak.

01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:07.580
That's the real issue that I think we've all had.

01:54:07.580 --> 01:54:09.500
He's just not getting his fair day in court.

01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:10.780
He's not getting his word out.

01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:15.420
Well, because the courts keep reading the petitions and being like, Oh, no, this is

01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:16.380
comically stupid.

01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:20.300
Yeah, reading is one of their big hang ups when it comes to writing.

01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:20.940
Yeah.

01:54:20.940 --> 01:54:25.580
So I think we have a pretty good start to the end of the year for Alex here.

01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:27.580
Wonder Woman sucks.

01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:28.080
Yep.

01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:37.100
Some harder COVID denialism, particularly around the like the 77 people, like that glaring

01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:40.140
misunderstanding of the data and the weaponization of it.

01:54:40.140 --> 01:54:40.640
Yeah.

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:47.840
Um, uh, I, I, I feel, I feel unglued, um, listening to this.

01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:52.000
Like I want to know, like there's no continuity.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.040
Right, right, right.

01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:54.400
It's just all over the place.

01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:54.720
Yeah.

01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:55.120
Yeah.

01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:55.760
It's everywhere.

01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:56.240
Yeah.

01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:59.920
Anyway, what happened to the, like, there's no follow up on the Nashville.

01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:00.560
We have it.

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:01.440
We have them now.

01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:02.800
You don't need to worry about it.

01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:08.640
What you need to worry about, Dan, is which of the Hollywood Chris's are you a fan of?

01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:10.800
Cause listen, I hate Chris Pine.

01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:12.320
I'm going to say it right now.

01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:13.760
I watched Wonder Woman.

01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:14.960
I hate Chris Pine.

01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:15.520
What about Evans?

01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:16.160
What about Evans?

01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:17.120
Captain America?

01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:18.080
I can't support that.

01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:19.520
All cops are bad.

01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:19.840
All right.

01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:20.400
What next?

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:22.480
Uh, Chris Hardwick.

01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:23.200
Chris Hardwick?

01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:24.880
Oh no, definitely a big no on that one.

01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:27.680
Gonna go with a big pass, a Rooney on that.

01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:29.360
What was the name I was trying to pull out?

01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:31.680
The guy from Parks and Rec.

01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:33.600
Chris, uh, uh, oh.

01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:36.080
Oh, now I can't remember.

01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:37.680
Wait, no, the character's name was Chris.

01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:38.160
Is that right?

01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:38.800
Yeah, yeah.

01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:40.080
I think that was Rob Lowe?

01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:40.240
No.

01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:41.440
Is that what you're talking about?

01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:43.600
I'm thinking of the guy from Jurassic Park.

01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:44.640
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:45.280
Oh, he sucks too.

01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:45.920
Chris Pratt.

01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:46.640
Yeah, Chris Pratt.

01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:47.920
He's a, he's a lunatic.

01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:48.480
He sucks.

01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:49.840
Yeah.

01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:50.560
Which is the other one?

01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:51.360
Chris Hemsworth.

01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:52.640
Who's Chris Hemsworth?

01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:53.120
Thor?

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:54.320
Or Thor's brother?

01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:55.040
Love Thor.

01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:55.440
Okay.

01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:55.920
Love Thor.

01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:57.200
That's my favorite Chris.

01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:57.680
Done.

01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:58.160
Great.

01:55:58.160 --> 01:55:58.800
What about you?

01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:00.320
I don't know, man.

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:01.040
Maybe all Chris's.

01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:03.840
Except for our conspiracy of Chris's.

01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:04.320
That's true.

01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:06.800
The wonderful Chris's that are in the Wonk nation.

01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:08.160
That's what I choose.

01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:08.480
Yep.

01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:09.440
You're stars to me.

01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:11.920
I love it.

01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:17.120
So we'll be back on our next episode on Monday to check in and see how Alex closes out the

01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:19.040
disastrous year that was 2020.

01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:19.760
Gotta get rid of it.

01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:24.720
And then, you know, we'll be into smoother sailing or not.

01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:25.360
Probably not.

01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:25.920
We'll see.

01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:26.240
Yep.

01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:27.120
We'll see.

01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:30.640
But happy new year to you and yours if you celebrate the Gregorians.

01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:30.960
Yep.

01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:35.120
If you're a Gregorian-ers, then yeah, happy new year to you.

01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:35.680
And we'll be back.

01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:36.880
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:37.600
We do have a website.

01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:38.960
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:40.000
So we're also on Twitter.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:40.640
We are on Twitter.

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:42.960
It's at knowledgefight.com and at go2bedjordan.

01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:43.120
Yep.

01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:44.000
We're also on Facebook.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:44.880
We are on Facebook.

01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:50.080
If you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out those

01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:50.880
doing God's work.

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:51.040
Yep.

01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:51.440
We'll be back.

01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:52.640
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:53.120
I'm Leo.

01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:54.400
I'm DZX clerk.

01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:55.440
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:57.120
I live on the edge, man.

01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:59.360
I live 45 minutes from town.

01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:01.040
Andy in Kansas.

Hello, Alex.

01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:05.760
I'm a first time caller.

I'm a huge fan.
