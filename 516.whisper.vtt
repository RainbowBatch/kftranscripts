N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:18.040
Damn, Ed, Jordan, I'm sweating

00:18.040 --> 00:21.280
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

00:21.280 --> 00:23.880
I have great respect for knowledgefight

00:23.880 --> 00:25.180
knowledgefight

00:25.180 --> 00:27.400
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

00:27.400 --> 00:30.040
Shang, we are the bad guys, knowledgefight

00:30.040 --> 00:32.200
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight

00:32.200 --> 00:35.040
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

00:35.040 --> 00:39.360
Need, I need money, riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

00:39.360 --> 00:42.200
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and

00:42.200 --> 00:46.200
Stop it, Andy and, Andy and Kansas

00:46.200 --> 00:47.120
It's time to pray

00:47.120 --> 00:49.440
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us

00:49.440 --> 00:51.760
Hello, Alex, I'm a sister in color, I'm a huge fan

00:51.760 --> 00:53.000
I love your work

00:53.000 --> 00:54.640
knowledgefight

00:54.640 --> 00:58.400
knowledgefight.com

00:58.400 --> 00:59.360
I love you

00:59.360 --> 01:01.280
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

01:01.280 --> 01:01.880
I'm Jordan

01:01.880 --> 01:04.000
We're a couple dudes, I like to sit around, drink novelty beverages

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:06.000 --> 01:07.280
Oh, indeed we are, Dan

01:07.280 --> 01:07.680
Jordan!

01:07.680 --> 01:08.080
Dan!

01:08.080 --> 01:08.520
Jordan!

01:08.520 --> 01:09.280
Quick question for you

01:09.280 --> 01:09.680
What's up?

01:09.680 --> 01:10.520
What's your bright spot today?

01:10.520 --> 01:14.800
My bright spot today, Jordan, is that I completed my newest little nanoblock sculpture

01:14.800 --> 01:16.080
Oh yeah, you did!

01:16.080 --> 01:18.800
I've been getting into these little mini Legos quite a bit

01:18.800 --> 01:19.800
and I got a new one

01:19.800 --> 01:21.640
I don't believe you can call them mini Legos

01:21.640 --> 01:25.400
that is a brand name, Dan, these are nanoblocks

01:25.400 --> 01:28.920
I got one that is the Easter Island Heads

01:28.920 --> 01:31.480
and it was a little bit easy, actually, it's pretty small

01:31.480 --> 01:35.520
but great, I've always had an attraction

01:35.520 --> 01:39.320
I've been drawn to the Easter Island, the statues

01:39.320 --> 01:40.120
You really have

01:40.120 --> 01:40.520
Yeah

01:40.520 --> 01:41.920
We've talked about this since like

01:41.920 --> 01:42.520
Since childhood

01:42.520 --> 01:43.400
Yeah

01:43.400 --> 01:46.840
There's something about, I don't know, maybe it's because I grew up in Hawaii for a while

01:46.840 --> 01:48.520
and there's something about the call of the islands

01:48.520 --> 01:49.320
You like an island

01:49.320 --> 01:50.360
I do like an island

01:50.360 --> 01:51.160
You like a good island

01:51.160 --> 01:51.880
Yes

01:51.880 --> 01:57.640
And I guess, you know, just the idea of those gigantic heads

01:57.640 --> 02:00.920
If you're a kid, that's amazing, it fills you with wonder

02:00.920 --> 02:02.040
Yeah, absolutely

02:02.040 --> 02:04.920
And so it's very nice to have this as a little decoration on the desk

02:04.920 --> 02:07.400
Yeah, it is always nice to see Easter Island

02:07.400 --> 02:10.600
because no matter, I mean, even if you know what's going on

02:10.600 --> 02:12.440
and how it was done

02:12.440 --> 02:12.840
Yeah

02:12.840 --> 02:15.720
As many archaeologists and scientists do

02:15.720 --> 02:18.520
there's still a party that just looks at those and go like

02:18.520 --> 02:19.960
The fuck were you guys thinking?

02:19.960 --> 02:20.440
It's still

02:20.440 --> 02:22.040
What was going on in your brains there?

02:22.040 --> 02:23.880
It's still remarkable no matter what

02:23.880 --> 02:24.600
Yeah, amazing

02:24.600 --> 02:28.200
And to a child, it's just amazing

02:28.200 --> 02:28.760
Absolutely

02:28.760 --> 02:29.800
So what about you, Jordan?

02:29.800 --> 02:34.280
Ah, Dan, I'm afraid my bright spot is going to be back in FF7

02:34.280 --> 02:35.240
Oh boy

02:35.240 --> 02:41.320
I just bred my 7,000th Gold Chocobo over the years

02:41.320 --> 02:43.560
In the 23 years that I've been playing this dumb game

02:43.560 --> 02:44.920
7,000 Chocobos

02:44.920 --> 02:46.440
So many Gold Chocobos

02:46.440 --> 02:51.240
But Dan, it's weird, I have bred my fastest ever Gold Chocobo

02:51.240 --> 02:54.360
It is, I've never seen a Chocobo this fast

02:54.360 --> 02:56.920
Number 7,000 was the fastest

02:56.920 --> 02:58.040
Something along those lines

02:58.040 --> 03:00.120
But yeah, it's incredibly fast

03:00.120 --> 03:01.160
It's very exciting for me

03:01.800 --> 03:03.560
And that's basically the end of the game

03:03.560 --> 03:06.680
Whenever I'm, I rarely ever finally finish the game

03:06.680 --> 03:08.600
It always ends once I've completed that

03:08.600 --> 03:10.280
Like you have to go through all these different things

03:10.280 --> 03:11.640
And it's just so fun

03:11.640 --> 03:12.440
It's fun

03:12.440 --> 03:13.960
And it's a sense of achievement

03:13.960 --> 03:15.320
And you develop a relationship

03:15.320 --> 03:16.200
I name them

03:16.200 --> 03:16.760
Sure

03:16.760 --> 03:17.320
It's fantastic

03:17.320 --> 03:20.920
This sounds exactly like the chows in Sonic Adventure 2 Battle

03:20.920 --> 03:23.560
Which I told you about when you told me you were back on your bullshit

03:23.560 --> 03:24.520
Oh, back on my bullshit

03:24.520 --> 03:25.640
Back on your Chocobo bullshit

03:25.640 --> 03:26.680
Back on my bullshit

03:26.680 --> 03:31.160
I can't wait to see how they handled Knights of the Round summon materia in the new remake

03:31.160 --> 03:32.120
That'll be incredible

03:32.120 --> 03:32.680
Ooh

03:32.680 --> 03:33.160
Ooh

03:34.600 --> 03:36.120
Well, I look forward to that on your behalf

03:37.480 --> 03:39.480
Jordan, today we got an interesting episode to go over

03:39.480 --> 03:42.120
We're going to be talking about December 31st, 2020

03:42.120 --> 03:43.240
I'm Dan, this is 2020

03:43.240 --> 03:45.800
Up to January 1st, 2021

03:45.800 --> 03:47.320
I'm Dan, this is now 2021

03:48.840 --> 03:49.640
Confusing

03:50.840 --> 03:53.000
We're going with the last day of last year and the first day

03:53.000 --> 03:54.360
New Year's Eve and New Year's Day

03:54.360 --> 03:54.760
Yep

03:54.760 --> 03:55.400
I gotcha

03:55.400 --> 03:57.080
Alex did do both of these shows

03:57.080 --> 03:57.640
Okay

03:57.640 --> 04:02.200
And there's, you know, some stuff

04:02.200 --> 04:03.160
Okay, good for him

04:03.160 --> 04:03.960
Yeah, I don't know

04:03.960 --> 04:07.400
I found myself, like, I had an interesting experience when I was listening to this

04:07.400 --> 04:07.880
Uh-huh

04:07.880 --> 04:10.600
It was one of those times that I'll listen to this show

04:10.600 --> 04:13.640
I'll listen to this show and I'll be like, all right, Alex

04:15.080 --> 04:19.560
As I'm listening to it, I'll find myself Mystery Science Theater-ing it

04:19.560 --> 04:21.720
Kind of like, oh yeah, sure you did

04:21.720 --> 04:22.200
Sure you did

04:22.840 --> 04:24.200
Okay, yeah, I bet

04:24.760 --> 04:25.560
Okay, all right

04:25.560 --> 04:29.560
Yeah, there's just a long stretches where I was like, okay, sure

04:29.560 --> 04:31.640
Jones, the hands of fate

04:31.640 --> 04:33.000
Just like nothing was going on

04:33.000 --> 04:33.480
Yeah

04:33.480 --> 04:34.360
For long stretches

04:34.360 --> 04:37.720
But there is some things that are important to discuss

04:37.720 --> 04:38.760
Visit from Torgo?

04:39.320 --> 04:39.960
We may

04:39.960 --> 04:40.360
Okay

04:40.360 --> 04:42.040
You really shoehorned that in

04:42.040 --> 04:43.560
I was trying real hard

04:43.560 --> 04:47.080
Uh, hands have faded that horned it in

04:47.080 --> 04:47.400
Dammit

04:48.120 --> 04:49.320
Horns have faded it in?

04:49.320 --> 04:49.640
Yeah

04:49.640 --> 04:50.120
Okay

04:50.120 --> 04:52.920
Before we get to today's episode though, let's take a moment to say thank you

04:52.920 --> 04:54.440
to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show

04:54.440 --> 04:55.240
Oh, that's a great idea

04:55.240 --> 04:59.880
So first, uh, Burnt W, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

04:59.880 --> 05:00.920
I'm a policy wonk

05:00.920 --> 05:02.280
Thank you, Burnt W

05:02.280 --> 05:05.160
Next to Megan S, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:05.160 --> 05:06.200
I'm a policy wonk

05:06.200 --> 05:07.000
Thanks, Megan

05:07.000 --> 05:07.480

05:13.400 --> 05:16.600
Next, Ian H, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:16.600 --> 05:17.640
I'm a policy wonk

05:17.640 --> 05:18.280
Thanks, Ian

05:18.280 --> 05:15.480
Thank you

05:18.680 --> 05:21.720
Next, Justin C, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:21.720 --> 05:22.520
I'm a policy wonk

05:22.520 --> 05:24.040
Thank you, Justin C

05:24.040 --> 05:24.600
Thank you

05:24.600 --> 05:27.800
Next, Reid G, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:27.800 --> 05:28.920
I'm a policy wonk

05:28.920 --> 05:29.640
Thanks, Reid

05:29.640 --> 05:33.240
And finally, uh, I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on elevated level

05:33.240 --> 05:34.440
and we appreciate that very much

05:34.440 --> 05:37.960
So first, Brianna R, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat

05:37.960 --> 05:42.520
And Dan, I'm so glad you don't have to sell blood anymore. You are now a technocrat.

05:42.520 --> 05:43.800
I'm a policy wonk.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.840
Crikey, mate. That's fantastic. Have yourself a brew.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.200
How's your 401k doing, bro?

05:48.200 --> 05:51.080
All right, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

05:51.080 --> 05:54.360
Let's just get down to business. We ain't making that money off that heroin.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.120
Why you pimps so good?

05:56.120 --> 06:00.680
My neck is freakishly large. I declare info war on you.

06:00.680 --> 06:05.080
Thank you so much. I got a correction. I accidentally said Brianna. It's Brenna.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.920
Oh, damn it, Dan.

06:06.920 --> 06:11.160
Sorry about that. I throw in eyes all over the place.

06:11.160 --> 06:11.660
Redo.

06:12.600 --> 06:16.120
Start it from the beginning. Hey, everybody. Welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.320
And thank you so much, Dan. I'm so glad you don't have to sell blood anymore.

06:19.320 --> 06:23.400
Yes, I'm not, Dan. I thought we were far more punk rock when you were selling blood.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.280
We were so fucking cool.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.720
I feel like we had more credibility.

06:25.720 --> 06:32.200
Totally. Now that you're comfortable in your single bedroom apartment as we record in your office.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.880
I do. I mean, I do feel spoiled.

06:35.880 --> 06:39.560
I live a pampered existence now that I don't have to sell blood.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.000
So opulent we live.

06:42.760 --> 06:47.800
Anyway, Jordan, today we got an episode.

06:47.800 --> 06:48.360
Oh, yeah.

06:48.360 --> 06:53.720
I found this intro to today's episode, this beginning, this first clip where Alex is just

06:53.720 --> 06:57.000
getting the gears going on New Year's Eve day. All right.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.560
I thought that this was really exciting.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.280
Okay.

07:00.280 --> 07:03.080
I was wrong, but I got pretty excited by it.

07:03.080 --> 07:10.040
Okay. Now, what is this? Well, this really is the equivalent of an intruder cell.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.200
He's talking about the vaccine.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.960
Sure. Just to be clear.

07:13.960 --> 07:14.460
Yeah.

07:16.280 --> 07:23.240
With an entire genome of multiple species, a chimera, a chimera clone of a human and a jellyfish.

07:23.240 --> 07:23.740
Love it.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.200
Coming in and assimilating your entire body.

07:26.200 --> 07:30.520
The jellyfish is a hive organism, a colony organism.

07:30.520 --> 07:34.920
Wait, all jellyfish or just this specific jellyfish?

07:34.920 --> 07:39.080
Going in and taking over every cell that replicates in your body.

07:39.080 --> 07:43.640
Only thing that will be the original you when it's done is the cells in your eyes

07:44.200 --> 07:46.200
and any eggs in a woman's ovaries.

07:47.400 --> 07:53.640
All other cells are to be taken over.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.440
They leave your eyes.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.680
Happening in the year 2021.

07:58.440 --> 08:04.200
It didn't come from some distant galaxy.

08:05.480 --> 08:09.720
It didn't come from some distant star.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.480
They came from a different dimension.

08:11.480 --> 08:14.840
From some far away planetary system.

08:14.840 --> 08:15.340
Sure.

08:16.760 --> 08:21.960
It came from the mad scientist here on our planet, but it is as alien as a Martian.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.600
It's as alien as somebody from Pluto.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.100
Why?

08:25.100 --> 08:31.880
It's as alien as some single cell organism in some planet orbiting Alpha Centuries or Betelgeuse.

08:33.080 --> 08:33.580
Really?

08:34.440 --> 08:35.080
Are we doing that?

08:36.040 --> 08:37.080
Are we really doing that?

08:39.560 --> 08:40.200
Music's back.

08:44.360 --> 08:45.800
Cell intruder MRNA.

08:47.240 --> 08:47.960
Human cell.

08:47.960 --> 08:51.640
Human cell.

08:51.640 --> 08:52.140
Uh-huh.

08:52.140 --> 08:55.720
Inject MRNA.

08:56.920 --> 08:57.420
Take over.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.560
Assimilation completed.

08:59.560 --> 08:59.960
Okay.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.240
It's pronounced Betelgeuse.

09:01.240 --> 09:01.960
Yeah, it is.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.400
Was there a five-second cut?

09:05.400 --> 09:07.720
Because I heard a difference in the sound.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.640
I think there might have been a cut where he went,

09:09.640 --> 09:10.360
Fuck!

09:10.360 --> 09:11.400
No, I don't think so.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.000
I don't think so.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.240
It would be tough to tell even if you watch the video.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.840
Yeah, because, you know, there's overlay of video.

09:18.840 --> 09:19.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:19.720 --> 09:25.480
I got really excited there because I was like, oh my god, Alex is doing a goddamn sci-fi speech

09:25.480 --> 09:27.160
over dramatic music.

09:27.160 --> 09:27.640
Hell yeah.

09:27.640 --> 09:30.200
I thought for sure it was like, oh, I'm gonna try.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.240
I'm gonna end this year.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.120
I've been terrible this whole year, but I'm gonna go out on top.

09:34.120 --> 09:34.760
Might as well.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.200
I am gonna have ambition.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.880
I'm gonna show you guys what I can do.

09:38.440 --> 09:42.280
And I went and I found the video and I was like, no, this is just a meme.

09:42.280 --> 09:46.840
Someone in the engineering room or like the producer is just playing a meme that has audio.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.600
It's from the movie The Thing.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.160
Uh-huh.

09:49.160 --> 09:53.160
And someone has just replaced, like, just written MRNA.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.440
Brilliant.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.280
Over the computer analysis scene.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.800
Brilliant.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.320
These people are geniuses.

09:59.320 --> 10:02.680
I was a little disappointed, but I still thought it...

10:02.680 --> 10:03.180
Yeah.

10:04.120 --> 10:04.520
I wish...

10:05.400 --> 10:06.520
It was a little different.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.160
I wish the right didn't own creativity, you know?

10:09.160 --> 10:11.000
They're just so goddamn creative.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.080
It's dumb, and I'm sure it was Count Dankula or whoever the fuck Alex is making his hot

10:17.080 --> 10:18.600
memes these days.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.800
But like, I just...

10:20.440 --> 10:25.560
When I was listening to it, what I got away from it or what I took from it as an audio

10:25.560 --> 10:30.760
thing was so much more disappointing when I realized it was just a meme that had accidental

10:30.760 --> 10:31.240
audio in it.

10:31.240 --> 10:32.200
I thought he was trying.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.400
Yeah, I really thought so, too.

10:33.400 --> 10:37.400
I thought it was a good choice of music to play behind that little creepy speech.

10:37.400 --> 10:37.480
It was ominous?

10:37.480 --> 10:38.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:38.440 --> 10:43.480
The thing is one of the top ten horror movies of all time, I would say.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.200
Beetle Geese.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.160
Better be goose.

10:46.200 --> 10:51.320
Man, he had to have realized, otherwise there wouldn't have been such a long pause, right?

10:51.320 --> 10:55.240
He realized instantly that is not how you say it.

10:55.240 --> 10:55.960
I don't think so.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.360
And then he was trying to find a way.

10:58.360 --> 10:59.960
I think he just ran out of gas.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.000
That could be.

11:01.000 --> 11:01.640
That could be.

11:01.640 --> 11:10.360
So apparently, top story, people are dying from the coronavirus vaccine, the COVID-19

11:10.360 --> 11:10.840
vaccine.

11:10.840 --> 11:11.480
What?

11:11.480 --> 11:11.640
No.

11:11.640 --> 11:16.280
They always say the devil is in the old details.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.480
Oh, more deaths, by the way.

11:20.200 --> 11:26.440
Deaths in Spain, deaths in Israel, deaths in Switzerland, deaths, deaths, deaths from

11:26.440 --> 11:30.040
the new mRNA genetic takeover systems.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.040
Beetle Geese.

11:33.080 --> 11:35.880
Folks are taking it, and they're dead in a couple hours.

11:36.760 --> 11:40.680
So I'm not sure about the supposed death that he's talking about in Spain, but there

11:40.680 --> 11:43.880
is an article on his website, at least, that tells you what he's talking about, about

11:43.880 --> 11:45.960
the Israel and Switzerland deaths.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.520
The Switzerland death doesn't appear to be related to the vaccine.

11:48.520 --> 11:49.080
Okay.

11:49.080 --> 11:54.200
And in the case of the person in Israel, it was a 75-year-old man who had cancer and a

11:54.200 --> 11:55.640
history of heart attacks.

11:55.640 --> 11:59.560
Doctors believe that though he died shortly after receiving the vaccine, the heart attack

11:59.560 --> 12:02.040
that killed him was unrelated to vaccination.

12:02.040 --> 12:05.720
I'm certain that that assumption that the doctors have is something that's going to

12:05.720 --> 12:06.600
be examined.

12:06.600 --> 12:06.840
Yeah.

12:06.840 --> 12:10.760
And I'll go ahead and listen to doctors about issues like this, not weirdos who ramble over

12:10.760 --> 12:13.400
80s sci-fi movies to sell dumb pills.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.000
Yeah, that one's a real...

12:16.680 --> 12:21.400
That requires a bit more of a titanic intellect to get to the bottom of that.

12:21.400 --> 12:26.200
Yeah, or if you're going to be like, deaths, deaths everywhere, you kind of have a responsibility

12:26.200 --> 12:26.920
of proof.

12:26.920 --> 12:32.120
You need a little bit more than a couple of stray cases of people who have conditions

12:32.120 --> 12:35.160
that could have not been related to the vaccine.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.200
I have a question for you.

12:36.200 --> 12:36.520
Yeah.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.880
How many doses of the vaccine worldwide have we got out so far?

12:39.880 --> 12:40.440
Well, there was three.

12:40.440 --> 12:43.880
There was just that one in Spain, that one in Israel, that one in Switzerland.

12:43.880 --> 12:44.360
Oh, okay.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.840
Well, then two for three is trouble.

12:46.840 --> 12:47.560
Oh, no.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.480
The vaccine rollout is not going well.

12:49.480 --> 12:49.800
Yeah.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.960
I'm going to need Alex to do a little better, and he does not.

12:51.960 --> 12:58.680
Yeah, so as you may recall, a little while back, someone got canned over at Infowars.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.520
I believe a lot of people got canned.

13:00.520 --> 13:01.560
Oh, man.

13:01.560 --> 13:02.280
David Knight.

13:02.280 --> 13:02.680
Yes.

13:02.680 --> 13:03.400
Is he back?

13:03.400 --> 13:03.640
No.

13:03.640 --> 13:04.040
Oh.

13:04.040 --> 13:10.760
David Knight is still on The Lamb doing his show on Periscope, which I can't imagine ever

13:10.760 --> 13:11.400
watching.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.200
No, no, no.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.080
That's where we...

13:13.080 --> 13:13.720
After Alex...

13:13.720 --> 13:14.600
I've been so close.

13:14.600 --> 13:18.120
After Infowars goes down, we're going right to David Knight's Periscope.

13:18.120 --> 13:21.880
I've been so close a couple of times to tuning in to see if he's talking shit, and then

13:21.880 --> 13:22.520
I just can't do it.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.720
Just to see if he's talking shit.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.120
Yeah.

13:24.120 --> 13:24.920
Can't pull the trigger.

13:24.920 --> 13:26.520
You want to see him talk good shit, though.

13:26.520 --> 13:27.000
Yeah, I do.

13:27.880 --> 13:34.280
When he was fired, I made a pronouncement, and that was, who the fuck else do you have

13:34.280 --> 13:34.680
there?

13:34.680 --> 13:34.920
Yes.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.040
Harrison Smith?

13:36.040 --> 13:36.680
What are you going to do?

13:36.680 --> 13:41.080
Have Harrison Smith host the hours that David Knight was on?

13:41.080 --> 13:44.040
So he's going to have Harrison Smith host the hours that David Knight was on.

13:44.040 --> 13:48.200
And we have the new American Journal hosted by Harrison Smith doing a splendid job.

13:48.200 --> 13:48.440
There we go.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.880
His name is AAM Central.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.880
I also pop in, so does Owen Schroyer.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.560
That is a total call-in show.

13:54.280 --> 14:02.600
But the final transmission of the Alex Jones show of the year 2020, what a year.

14:04.360 --> 14:08.840
I'd like to get your take on what you think is coming in the new year, and what your resolutions

14:08.840 --> 14:13.240
are in the new year, and what you think our focus should be in the new year.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.200
Great question.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.160
Reading.

14:15.160 --> 14:15.720
Yeah.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.840
That would be a good focus for you, Alex.

14:18.840 --> 14:20.280
Read the articles you cover.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.280
That would be a good start.

14:22.280 --> 14:25.960
Get an hour away from your recording studio at all times.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.080
That would be my suggestion.

14:27.080 --> 14:27.800
Yeah, go with the scouser.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.960
Get an hour away from everywhere.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.080
Get Harrison an hour away, too.

14:31.080 --> 14:31.960
Yeah, get everybody.

14:31.960 --> 14:36.280
Although, I mean, I've talked a lot of shit about Harrison Smith being an uninteresting

14:36.280 --> 14:37.080
bump on a log.

14:38.120 --> 14:41.720
Basically the equivalent of a cardboard cutout of a host.

14:41.720 --> 14:47.640
But again, what American Journal is trying to be is like a call-in show with a completely

14:47.640 --> 14:48.520
neutral host.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:49.400 --> 14:54.840
He is probably the only person who you might be able to, like, he's so boring he fits that

14:54.840 --> 14:55.160
role.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.520
Yeah, I'd say he's their best shot.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.880
He is an upgrade in terms of a boring-ometer.

14:59.880 --> 15:00.200
Yes.

15:00.200 --> 15:00.920
From David Knight.

15:01.720 --> 15:05.320
Going to the applause-o-meter, we're still at zero, but it's 0.2.

15:05.320 --> 15:05.720
Yes.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.480
Instead of 0.0.

15:07.480 --> 15:11.960
Also, I went to the American Journal page on band.video, because I was thinking about,

15:11.960 --> 15:15.080
like, seeing if Alex had been hosting it, and I saw that it was Harrison Smith.

15:15.080 --> 15:15.480
Sure, sure, sure.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.680
I'm not even gonna fish in this well.

15:18.680 --> 15:25.400
But I did notice, it's a little bit in your face that American Journal's initials are

15:25.400 --> 15:26.600
the same as Alex Jones.

15:26.600 --> 15:26.920
Okay.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.040
It just has a big AJ on it.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.400
The AJ Show.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.080
Not the Alex Jones Show.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.840
The American Journal Show.

15:34.840 --> 15:35.720
Completely different.

15:35.720 --> 15:38.440
I didn't realize it until I went to the website and I saw those graphics.

15:38.440 --> 15:41.000
I was like, this is a little bit much.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.240
Put your name on the building.

15:43.240 --> 15:47.960
So we got some people dying of COVID in the last week.

15:48.760 --> 15:51.400
Some celebrities and some high-profile people.

15:51.400 --> 15:51.880
Sure.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.960
And these are people that Alex needs to push back on.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.480
Yeah, they're globalists or whatever.

15:55.480 --> 15:59.560
Well, Luke Letlow just got elected to Congress.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.080
And then what happened?

16:02.200 --> 16:05.800
And then they said he died of COVID.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.760
But what happened is he went in, he tested positive for COVID.

16:09.320 --> 16:11.000
They did a quote, surgery on him.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
He had a heart attack and died.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.960
You got to read the fine print, but they say he died of a heart attack.

16:19.560 --> 16:24.360
Well, 80 something year old Dawn Wells of Marianne fame of Gilligan's Island.

16:24.360 --> 16:25.880
One of my favorite silly shows.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.160
Some earliest memories are watching Gilligan's Island.

16:31.160 --> 16:33.400
Dies of COVID-19 at 82.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.680
Complications.

16:34.680 --> 16:37.080
Dumbass Alex Jones probably thought that was a documentary.

16:37.080 --> 16:41.160
These people have been on that island for a long time.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.080
Too bad they can't get off.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.360
Those rich people seem nice.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.360
I'd like to hang out with them.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.520
And my favorite thing about these people on the island is they're all white.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.720
They're all ungrateful.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.280
They wouldn't have been there if they weren't for that boat in the first place.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.840
So Alex is really playing fast and loose with the details of these situations,

16:58.840 --> 17:03.080
particularly with that of Luke Letlow, because he knows it's really bad.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.240
And stories like this are really hard for him to spin.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.080
And so when he, you know, when that happens,

17:07.080 --> 17:09.880
he basically just denies reality as a primary strategy.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.960
Letlow had been elected to Congress to represent the 5th district in Louisiana,

17:13.960 --> 17:18.280
but before he could be sworn in, he died at the age of 41 from COVID-19.

17:18.280 --> 17:21.880
The way Alex is presenting the story, it sounds like he just happened to have COVID

17:21.880 --> 17:25.160
and he went to get a completely unrelated quote surgery

17:25.160 --> 17:27.080
and then died of a heart attack in that surgery.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.360
But that is not what happened.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.320
He entered Monroe Hospital on December 19th because of COVID symptoms.

17:33.320 --> 17:38.360
And his condition deteriorated quickly, leading to him entering the ICU on December 23rd.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.280
There he suffered a heart attack that, quote,

17:40.280 --> 17:45.320
was refractory to all resuscitation efforts, according to Dr. G.E. Galley.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.960
The New Orleans Times-Picayune reported, quote,

17:47.960 --> 17:52.040
asked if Letlow had any underlying conditions that would have made his death more likely.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.840
Galley said in a text message, quote, none.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.120
All COVID-related.

17:56.680 --> 17:59.160
Alex is lying to his audience about this case to make them,

17:59.160 --> 18:01.720
you know, less likely to take COVID-19 seriously.

18:01.720 --> 18:02.280
That's bad.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.000
Yeah.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.840
Now, as for Dawn Wells, he better keep her name out of his mouth.

18:06.840 --> 18:12.040
She was a great woman, which I'm basically saying mostly because she was an alum of Stevens College,

18:12.040 --> 18:14.440
which is in my hometown of Columbia, Missouri.

18:14.440 --> 18:17.400
She would come to town regularly and speak with theater students there.

18:17.400 --> 18:21.000
And everyone I knew who'd met her and spent time with her really gave me the impression

18:21.000 --> 18:25.160
that she cared a lot about being able to give whatever she could to these students,

18:25.160 --> 18:26.760
which I always found really admirable.

18:26.760 --> 18:27.080
Always.

18:27.080 --> 18:30.760
I've always, I've grown up with a, with a deep appreciation for Dawn Wells,

18:30.760 --> 18:34.120
both as like someone who liked Gilligan's Island as a kid,

18:34.120 --> 18:40.520
and someone who was tertiarily aware of some of her, uh, like decency as an adult.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.000
Sure.

18:41.000 --> 18:41.320
Sure.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.320
She was 82 years old, but from all accounts,

18:43.320 --> 18:45.320
including a video she posted around Christmas,

18:45.320 --> 18:48.120
she was in really good health until she got COVID-19,

18:48.120 --> 18:50.440
at which point things went downhill fast.

18:50.440 --> 18:51.960
From the details that are available,

18:51.960 --> 18:55.160
it does not seem outlandish to ascribe her death to COVID.

18:55.160 --> 18:59.160
These are two recent deaths that are high profile and very emotionally resonant.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.880
So it's critical and important for Alex to attempt

19:01.880 --> 19:04.200
to deny the reality of these deaths to his audience.

19:04.840 --> 19:08.920
Luke Letlow was only 41 years old, and he'd just been elected to a seat in Congress.

19:08.920 --> 19:12.040
He had his life ahead of him and it was snatched away by COVID.

19:12.040 --> 19:15.880
On the other side, Dawn Wells was a sweetheart for most of the audience,

19:15.880 --> 19:19.160
for their youths, the person that they had a crush on when they were children.

19:19.720 --> 19:23.640
Sure, her passing has the possibility of being like emotionally affecting to them in a way

19:23.640 --> 19:25.080
that could be unpredictable.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.240
So Alex has got to pretend that all this is bullshit.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.280
And I just hate it.

19:28.280 --> 19:28.760
I hate it.

19:28.760 --> 19:29.800
Yeah, yeah.

19:29.800 --> 19:30.520
I mean, it's...

19:32.920 --> 19:35.720
How do humans act this despicably?

19:35.720 --> 19:36.440
You ever wonder?

19:37.960 --> 19:42.360
You know, when he says you can look into the abyss, that old nature character.

19:42.360 --> 19:46.120
When you can look into the abyss, then the, you know, the nature.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.160
Yeah, that character.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.520
The character, okay.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.440
And then the abyss looks back.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.480
But you don't deny a pandemic.

19:53.480 --> 19:54.680
Isn't that different?

19:54.680 --> 19:55.720
Isn't that different?

19:55.720 --> 19:56.280
I don't know.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.400
Isn't that just too wrong?

19:57.400 --> 20:02.120
There's a small part of me that I suspect that Alex realizes, like, I can't go back.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.320
I've already gone too far down this road.

20:05.320 --> 20:05.800
Yeah.

20:05.800 --> 20:09.720
No matter what, I have to commit to this because going back looks so dumb.

20:09.720 --> 20:11.800
What happens if I say, whoops.

20:11.800 --> 20:12.200
Yeah.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.200
I've got years.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.600
What if in 2006 he'd been like, you know what?

20:17.160 --> 20:19.160
I was wrong about 9-11.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.080
What kind of a career could he possibly have?

20:21.080 --> 20:24.920
He'd spent so much time insisting 9-11 was an inside job and all this.

20:24.920 --> 20:29.080
If he did that now or at any point, he's like, oh, you know what?

20:29.080 --> 20:30.920
We got to take over real seriously, guys.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.840
Masks are not a sign of slavery.

20:33.560 --> 20:34.920
You should get the vaccine.

20:34.920 --> 20:35.640
He can't do it.

20:35.640 --> 20:36.760
He can't double back.

20:36.760 --> 20:40.840
It's just so weird because when you look at the history of capitalism and you see how

20:40.840 --> 20:45.720
many times people have had the choice between continuing to make money or doing the responsible

20:45.720 --> 20:49.720
thing and saving lives, it's always been saving lives with capitalism.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.160
That's what I've always thought of.

20:51.160 --> 20:56.520
I wonder, I mean, you're putting it in terms of making money.

20:56.520 --> 21:03.640
And I do think that that's a piece of it, but it's also like, his whole career is torpedo.

21:03.640 --> 21:04.120
Totally.

21:04.120 --> 21:08.760
Like he's already on the way to that happening slowly by a thousand cuts that mostly are

21:08.760 --> 21:15.720
in the shape of a cube, but it would be a disaster for him and it would invalidate a

21:15.720 --> 21:19.160
lot of what he probably would like to be his legacy.

21:19.160 --> 21:26.200
Yeah, I just don't know how you could be in his situation and not like see the writing

21:26.200 --> 21:29.640
on the wall and seek to control how you go out.

21:29.640 --> 21:30.280
You know?

21:30.280 --> 21:31.240
Narcissism, my man.

21:31.240 --> 21:33.080
Yeah, that's so right.

21:33.080 --> 21:36.760
I wish I could argue with that, but that's 100% correct.

21:36.760 --> 21:37.400
Nevermind.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.240
It's just feelings of like...

21:40.280 --> 21:43.000
I retract all my statements and confirm my ennui.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.080
And think about how many times he's been like back against the wall and been able to wiggle

21:47.080 --> 21:47.640
out of things.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.120
Yeah.

21:48.120 --> 21:51.320
But something this big, you can't really do that.

21:52.920 --> 22:01.160
When you're actively calling for the overthrowing of an election and denying a large-scale pandemic

22:01.160 --> 22:06.280
that's killing thousands of people a day, you can't just be like, whoops, I whiffed

22:06.280 --> 22:07.160
on that one.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.280
It doesn't work.

22:08.280 --> 22:08.520
Yeah.

22:08.520 --> 22:14.120
And I mean, at this point you have to reframe it in an almost borderline sense of like,

22:14.120 --> 22:18.360
this is the ultimate expression of class warfare.

22:18.360 --> 22:21.480
Poor people are dying at rates infinitely higher.

22:22.360 --> 22:23.560
That's what this is.

22:23.560 --> 22:27.400
Like, I'm amazed that we can't even talk about it in those terms.

22:27.400 --> 22:30.200
That would be an interesting way for Alex to try and approach it.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.200
I mean, it would have the air of populism.

22:32.200 --> 22:32.440
Yeah.

22:32.440 --> 22:32.920
Certainly.

22:33.880 --> 22:34.360
Oh, well.

22:34.360 --> 22:35.720
But they do want the poor to die.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.720
So it kind of up and down.

22:37.720 --> 22:43.000
So you're saying like denying the pandemic is really monstrous and how do people do that?

22:43.000 --> 22:43.240
Yeah.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.360
I agree with you, but I think you're selling Alex short.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.160
He can be worse.

22:47.160 --> 22:47.960
Okay.

22:47.960 --> 22:53.160
And they're even arresting people now that go into the empty hospital.

22:53.160 --> 22:54.680
So I want to be very, very clear.

22:54.680 --> 22:57.000
You need to go show the parking lot empty.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.160
You need to show the receiving area empty.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.440
You can shoot a time-lapse.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.760
If they tell you to leave, leave.

23:03.560 --> 23:11.480
But we've got multiple videos of people being arrested in the US and the UK when they go

23:11.480 --> 23:14.200
to the hospitals, I don't think it violates.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.200
I don't think it violates privacy.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.360
I don't think the public has a right to know.

23:18.360 --> 23:19.800
It does cover by whistleblowing.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.960
It's covered by investigative journalism is not.

23:21.960 --> 23:26.040
No, it is certainly not the arrest that Alex is referring to.

23:26.040 --> 23:30.520
I don't know what United States person he's talking about, but there's definitely a person

23:30.520 --> 23:35.480
in the UK named Debbie Hicks, who is an anti lockdown protester who showed up at a hospital

23:35.480 --> 23:39.640
and recorded people to try and argue that there aren't any COVID-19 patients being treated

23:39.640 --> 23:44.600
at forgive me in advance, Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.

23:44.600 --> 23:45.080
Okay.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.760
She got arrested for that video.

23:46.760 --> 23:47.880
Isn't that Gloucestershire?

23:47.880 --> 23:48.440
Whatever.

23:48.440 --> 23:48.840
All right.

23:50.040 --> 23:54.920
From now on, I'm just mispronouncing places harder.

23:54.920 --> 23:55.720
Who cares?

23:55.720 --> 24:00.920
2021 is the year of me leaning into mispronouncing place names.

24:00.920 --> 24:01.720
Hey, come on.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.240
The UK won't even be the UK.

24:03.240 --> 24:06.200
You won't even need to remember how to pronounce United Kingdom.

24:06.200 --> 24:07.320
It's going to be over soon.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.720
Glues, sure.

24:09.720 --> 24:14.520
So, yeah, she was videotaping patients who were waiting to see doctors, which is a serious

24:14.520 --> 24:17.000
breach of confidentiality and privacy.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.760
This is the case that Alex is referring to.

24:18.760 --> 24:22.600
So when he says that he doesn't think that doing what that person is doing is a violation

24:22.600 --> 24:24.840
of HIPAA, he is absolutely wrong.

24:24.840 --> 24:28.200
He's directly telling his audience to behave in ways that would violate the rights of privacy

24:28.200 --> 24:29.640
of persons seeking medical care.

24:29.640 --> 24:35.240
He better seriously hope people don't follow through with that and yell infowars.com in

24:35.240 --> 24:38.200
the video, because if they do, he might be in trouble.

24:38.200 --> 24:43.320
I would like more people to attribute their crimes to infowars.com.

24:43.320 --> 24:47.400
See, that could be the double-edged sword of him offering money for people who yell

24:47.400 --> 24:52.680
stuff at rallies and yell infowars.com if they start doing things that he doesn't think

24:52.680 --> 24:54.360
are illegal, but probably are.

24:54.360 --> 25:00.440
If the RV bomber screamed out, Bill Clinton was a rapist before the RV exploded, I think

25:00.440 --> 25:03.080
we'd have a little bit more of a clear-cut idea.

25:03.080 --> 25:05.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:05.320 --> 25:08.600
Alex gets back to talking about demons.

25:09.320 --> 25:09.640
Sure.

25:09.640 --> 25:10.360
He can see them.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.800
Newsome with that big jack-o'-lantern demon face.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.280
I'd run from that guy that saw him in an alley.

25:16.280 --> 25:16.840
He scares me.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.000
People don't have the sight, though.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.080
What's Newsome doing in that alley?

25:21.080 --> 25:22.040
I would run too.

25:22.040 --> 25:22.920
Killer level demon.

25:22.920 --> 25:23.800
That's about as bad as they...

25:23.800 --> 25:25.880
That's Satan's helper right there.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.280
I mean, Cuomo, open demon.

25:28.280 --> 25:28.920
Look at him.

25:28.920 --> 25:29.800
Open demon.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.320
Brian Stelter, open demon.

25:31.320 --> 25:33.320
Open demon.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.600
They've got the look.

25:34.600 --> 25:35.400
They got the look.

25:36.360 --> 25:39.240
Is that a term that I don't know?

25:39.800 --> 25:40.600
Open demon?

25:40.600 --> 25:41.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.720
Is that a categorization of demon?

25:43.720 --> 25:50.360
You know, it's hard at around, you know, anywhere from like 10 to 15.

25:50.360 --> 25:53.960
You're going to have to come out as a demon to your parents and it's going to be brutal.

25:55.160 --> 25:56.280
Go to demon...

25:58.200 --> 25:58.840
I got nothing.

25:58.840 --> 26:04.840
I don't like, I mean, I kind of enjoy Alex's continuing insistence that he can see demons

26:04.840 --> 26:09.240
in people, although I think if taken not as a joke, it's really scary.

26:09.240 --> 26:09.740
Yeah.

26:10.520 --> 26:12.440
It implies something deeply disturbed.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.080
What's the look?

26:13.880 --> 26:14.680
I don't know.

26:14.680 --> 26:15.880
Whatever Alex doesn't like.

26:15.880 --> 26:19.480
Oh, the look actually, it seems to have to do something to do with political beliefs.

26:21.480 --> 26:25.160
Turns out political beliefs can change the way you look to Alex.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.120
That makes sense.

26:26.120 --> 26:26.840
That makes sense.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.680
Oh, weird how it's all super subjective.

26:28.680 --> 26:30.520
It's a lot clearer to me now.

26:30.520 --> 26:34.120
But it's good that you were talking over that because he does say that people without discernment

26:34.120 --> 26:34.620
can't.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.320
Yeah, apparently you need discernment.

26:37.320 --> 26:38.360
I hate that word.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.640
So speaking of discernment.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.040
Sure.

26:40.040 --> 26:42.040
Alex has it in bucket loads.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.000
Sure, he does.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.960
So I'm gonna go back to Robert here and the rest of your calls, but the big news coming

26:45.960 --> 26:46.600
up next hour.

26:46.600 --> 26:48.280
Linwood files emergency petition.

26:48.280 --> 26:53.000
US Supreme Court stopped January 5th runoff races in the US Senate in Georgia, which Trump

26:53.000 --> 26:53.800
should have done.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.800
Those are sending in the same fake ballots.

26:55.800 --> 27:02.280
They're engaged the same fraud again, and if we let them do it, they'll do it again.

27:02.280 --> 27:05.960
So Alex hasn't gotten the memo to ixnay on the Linwood.

27:05.960 --> 27:09.400
Don't vote, don't vote, don't vote, don't vote, don't vote.

27:09.400 --> 27:09.960
No, no, no.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.920
Even beyond that, don't bring up Linwood by name.

27:12.920 --> 27:14.040
I think it's a bad idea.

27:14.040 --> 27:14.360
Yeah.

27:14.360 --> 27:15.080
I think it's a bad idea.

27:15.080 --> 27:16.440
This isn't gonna be good for anybody.

27:18.040 --> 27:18.840
It's not smart.

27:18.840 --> 27:19.240
No.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.200
I would say no.

27:20.200 --> 27:23.080
Everyone stopped mentioning Sidney Powell.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.320
We've stopped because a lot of this.

27:25.320 --> 27:27.640
We don't want to talk about krakens anymore.

27:27.640 --> 27:34.520
I don't like how it seems like everybody can get away with just kind of like letting the

27:34.520 --> 27:37.000
detritus fall off the back of the ship.

27:37.000 --> 27:42.680
You know, like Sidney Powell can just be drowned as she as the boat leaves and Trump and everybody

27:42.680 --> 27:44.120
on the boat are fine.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.520
No, she should take the boat down with her.

27:46.520 --> 27:52.440
It seems like cause and effect would lead to that, but yeah, I don't know.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.360
I'm constantly surprised.

27:54.360 --> 27:58.440
We just watch them like throw Sidney Powell off the boat and we're like, well, the boat's

27:58.440 --> 27:59.400
fine at least.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.240
Well, I mean, like she shouldn't have been on that boat.

28:01.240 --> 28:01.480
Yeah.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.840
No, she was invited on the boat.

28:04.840 --> 28:11.560
I know, but we just look at it like she should have been on the boat.

28:11.560 --> 28:12.440
We're glad she's not on the boat.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.560
We're glad you know.

28:13.560 --> 28:15.080
No, the whole boat should be gone.

28:15.080 --> 28:18.200
Well, maybe that makes more sense.

28:18.200 --> 28:19.080
God damn it.

28:19.080 --> 28:19.960
Speaking of boats.

28:19.960 --> 28:20.200
What?

28:20.200 --> 28:21.160
You know who had a lot of boats?

28:21.720 --> 28:22.360
Alex?

28:22.360 --> 28:24.520
No, well, yes, but more.

28:24.520 --> 28:25.240
Oh, okay.

28:25.240 --> 28:25.960
Actually, guess.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.760
Guess how many boats or who it is?

28:28.760 --> 28:29.080
No, no, no.

28:29.080 --> 28:31.480
So a group that would have a lot of boats.

28:31.480 --> 28:33.560
A group that would have a lot of boats.

28:33.560 --> 28:34.200
North Korea.

28:34.200 --> 28:37.080
No, they may not have existed.

28:39.800 --> 28:45.560
A group that may not have existed, but had they existed would indeed surely have had

28:45.560 --> 28:45.720
a lot of boats.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.960
But I think Alex thinks they definitely existed.

28:47.960 --> 28:48.760
Okay.

28:48.760 --> 28:49.480
All right.

28:49.480 --> 28:50.360
I got nothing then.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.840
The Atlanteans.

28:52.840 --> 28:59.080
And so it's a private corporate government who's in game is depopulation of the planet.

28:59.080 --> 28:59.320
Sure.

29:00.040 --> 29:05.240
And the establishment will then merge with machines and become this new evolved creature.

29:05.240 --> 29:08.280
Now, whether they're going to get away with that or whether that's going to work, I don't

29:08.280 --> 29:08.780
know.

29:09.320 --> 29:11.720
The Bible says they're going to try to do it and it's going to fail.

29:11.720 --> 29:12.440
Does the Bible say that?

29:12.440 --> 29:16.360
Destroy most of the Earth, which they say happened with Atlantis before.

29:16.360 --> 29:17.880
So things, I guess, repeat themselves.

29:17.880 --> 29:18.440
Who's they?

29:18.440 --> 29:21.320
Who says that's what happened with Atlantis?

29:21.320 --> 29:23.480
I believe the Disney movie Atlantis.

29:24.200 --> 29:30.520
Did even the Disney movie say that the elites were trying to become robot immortals or whatever?

29:30.520 --> 29:33.720
No, they were already robot immortals in the Disney movie.

29:33.720 --> 29:34.200
Okay.

29:34.200 --> 29:34.760
Yeah.

29:34.760 --> 29:37.720
Maybe, I mean, there's some Assassin's Creed in here, I think.

29:37.720 --> 29:40.600
I think the narrative would be improved with Michael J. Fox.

29:40.600 --> 29:43.160
I just think that's just true.

29:43.160 --> 29:48.520
I, look, Alex is broke or in prison one day.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.020
Sure.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.080
I finally get to sit.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.480
I pick up the phone across from the plexiglass.

29:53.480 --> 29:57.240
You got your little prison-approved crayon in your other hand.

29:57.240 --> 30:00.440
The only thing I want to know, do you think Atlantis is real?

30:02.680 --> 30:03.720
Wait, I thought you were going to...

30:04.520 --> 30:07.720
I thought we had a lot of talk about it because, no, you covered my show.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.240
Only fucking question.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.560
Do you really think Atlantis is real?

30:12.280 --> 30:12.920
Oh, yeah.

30:12.920 --> 30:13.960
Because you know what's fucked up?

30:13.960 --> 30:15.320
I mean, we've talked about this a bunch.

30:15.320 --> 30:16.280
I love Atlantis.

30:16.280 --> 30:16.920
Oh, you love Atlantis.

30:16.920 --> 30:18.440
I think it's a wonder...

30:18.440 --> 30:21.480
Again, maybe it's because I had that time growing up in the islands.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.480
The call of the island is strong.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.800
You're an info-lawyer, if you will.

30:25.800 --> 30:26.040
Sure.

30:26.920 --> 30:30.760
I would never argue that Atlantis is real.

30:30.760 --> 30:31.240
It was real?

30:31.240 --> 30:31.560
No.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.280
It was real?

30:32.280 --> 30:33.480
Are you sure it wasn't real?

30:33.480 --> 30:33.880
No.

30:33.880 --> 30:35.640
I love thinking about it.

30:35.640 --> 30:36.600
I like the ideas.

30:36.600 --> 30:39.800
I like a lot of the sort of themes that have come from it.

30:39.800 --> 30:40.300
Sure.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.940
Where would you think it was?

30:42.940 --> 30:43.420
Were it...

30:44.300 --> 30:45.180
Santorini?

30:45.180 --> 30:45.900
Santorini.

30:45.900 --> 30:46.380
That's where you're going.

30:46.380 --> 30:46.540
Right?

30:46.540 --> 30:47.340
Isn't that...

30:47.340 --> 30:47.900
I don't know.

30:47.900 --> 30:48.220
I don't know.

30:48.220 --> 30:50.060
A lot of people say a lot of different things.

30:50.060 --> 30:50.620
I think it's...

30:51.420 --> 30:54.780
I think most people assume that they meant the Mediterranean at the beginning,

30:54.780 --> 30:55.900
and then everybody...

30:55.900 --> 30:57.260
The world got bigger, and they were like,

30:57.260 --> 30:58.620
Ooh, that's not going to look good.

30:58.620 --> 31:00.380
So it's probably in the ocean somewhere.

31:00.380 --> 31:02.220
Over by the plateau of Leng.

31:02.220 --> 31:02.720
Yeah.

31:03.660 --> 31:04.300
Sure.

31:04.300 --> 31:06.620
I think it's from Lovecraft's dream cycle.

31:06.620 --> 31:07.100
I like it.

31:07.100 --> 31:15.020
So Alex, in the past, has asserted that the Trump...

31:15.020 --> 31:20.220
One of his kids, one of Trump's kids, asked Alex to investigate Dominion.

31:20.220 --> 31:25.900
And Alex got a crack team of sleuths on it, and they uncovered from SEC filings

31:25.900 --> 31:31.980
that the state of China had given Dominion 400 million dollars or something along those lines.

31:31.980 --> 31:33.820
Yes, they did say they discovered that.

31:33.820 --> 31:35.980
We've talked about this already on a past episode,

31:35.980 --> 31:40.620
but spoiler alert, that was a QAnon post that Alex had found.

31:40.620 --> 31:41.820
And he had taken credit for...

31:41.820 --> 31:42.700
Crack team of sleuths.

31:42.700 --> 31:46.140
Um, he's still claiming that Trump's son told him...

31:46.140 --> 31:46.640
Hell yeah.

31:47.660 --> 31:49.340
What's crazy is the White House knows this.

31:49.340 --> 31:52.860
I got asked by one of the Trump sons about a weekend of the election.

31:52.860 --> 31:54.300
When I was out in Arizona, they said,

31:54.860 --> 31:56.380
and they go, I want you to talk to this guy.

31:56.380 --> 31:59.180
This guy calls up and he works for a big company.

31:59.180 --> 32:01.740
And he says, we want you to look into where they get the money

32:01.740 --> 32:04.860
for Staple Streets and for Dominion, it's sub-company.

32:05.420 --> 32:08.780
And so I went and hired a company, took them three weeks,

32:09.420 --> 32:18.780
and they found the LLCs in Switzerland and the 400 million on October 7th of this year, 2020,

32:19.500 --> 32:23.500
being sent to Dominion by the Communist Party.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.740
So yeah, I only play that to like,

32:25.740 --> 32:28.460
demonstrate that Alex has really not given up on that narrative.

32:28.460 --> 32:29.500
Yeah, he should let that one go.

32:29.500 --> 32:30.220
Which is really sad.

32:30.220 --> 32:32.220
He should let that one go.

32:32.220 --> 32:35.420
Well, it's just sad to look at because I think that what's not,

32:35.980 --> 32:38.620
the part about the Dominion and the documents and stuff,

32:38.620 --> 32:41.740
it seems to be less important than Trump's son sent me on a mission.

32:41.740 --> 32:43.980
Yeah, he's very proud of that thing that didn't happen.

32:43.980 --> 32:47.340
Yeah, that part is really what is sadder about this.

32:47.340 --> 32:50.860
He's puffing his chest out about a thing that definitely didn't happen.

32:50.860 --> 32:51.360
Yeah.

32:51.340 --> 32:51.840
Yeah.

32:52.460 --> 32:54.700
Boy, no, no, it's not.

32:54.700 --> 32:56.460
So he takes a number of calls on the show.

32:56.460 --> 33:00.220
I will give it up to Alex on this front.

33:00.220 --> 33:03.420
For winning the bronze at the Nagano Olympics, which he also totally did?

33:03.420 --> 33:03.920
Yes.

33:04.300 --> 33:07.260
He set out to take more calls and he achieved that.

33:07.260 --> 33:09.900
I don't know if they fixed the phone lines or it was coincidence,

33:09.900 --> 33:12.380
but there weren't any big fuck-ups in the calls.

33:12.380 --> 33:16.700
Like it actually worked kind of, but the calls are largely boring.

33:16.700 --> 33:17.200
Well.

33:17.260 --> 33:21.900
Now, this one guy does call in and he wants to talk about hand sanitizer.

33:21.900 --> 33:22.400
Sure.

33:22.400 --> 33:26.880
And I'm here for that conversation, I would like a hand sanitizer conversation.

33:26.880 --> 33:32.800
This bums me out because this is just a clip of like, why does Alex ask people questions?

33:33.440 --> 33:38.800
Uh, the hand sanitizers, hand gel, mass used to create new superbugs,

33:38.800 --> 33:42.800
scientist warns, and a bunch of other articles about how it lowers your fertility,

33:42.800 --> 33:46.000
sterilizes you, makes you sick and kills your good bacteria.

33:46.000 --> 33:46.960
Explain that to people.

33:46.960 --> 33:53.200
Well, uh, what happens is it messes up your hormones, um, because of the, um, antibacterial,

33:53.200 --> 33:57.680
you want some good bacteria is, uh, on your body that actually heals you.

33:57.680 --> 34:02.240
And, uh, it actually, it turns out that the solid parts of our body,

34:02.240 --> 34:04.400
something like a third of us is bacteria.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.720
And Bill Gates knows that and studies it and he loves you though.

34:08.160 --> 34:09.680
I don't know why he has a weird noise.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.440
Yeah, I don't like that noise at all.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.040
I don't know why he asks people questions.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.720
You just immediately interrupts them.

34:14.720 --> 34:18.000
Yeah, I mean, that was a terrible answer that deserved interrupting.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.200
I don't disagree.

34:19.200 --> 34:20.080
It's still rude.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.360
It's still not a good host behavior.

34:23.360 --> 34:23.840
That's fair.

34:23.840 --> 34:29.120
So Alex is operating there at the end, uh, of old disproven scientific estimates.

34:29.120 --> 34:33.680
In 2016, researchers examined the previously accepted ideas about the ratio of human cells

34:33.680 --> 34:37.600
to bacteria in the body, and they found that there was a serious lack of backing for what

34:37.600 --> 34:40.560
had been up to that point considered conventional thinking.

34:40.560 --> 34:46.160
Previously, it was accepted as possible that microorganisms outnumbered human cells 10

34:46.160 --> 34:50.560
to one in our bodies, but these researchers were able to trace this back solely to an

34:50.560 --> 34:55.280
estimate from a 1972 paper in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

34:55.280 --> 34:59.280
By reexamining assumptions made back then and taking a more scientific approach, these

34:59.280 --> 35:03.600
researchers arrived at a percentage of 0.3% of your body weight as bacteria.

35:03.600 --> 35:07.680
In terms of pure numbers, they found that there's an approximately one to one ratio

35:07.680 --> 35:12.720
of bacteria in human cells in most adult bodies, but it's still only 0.3% of your body.

35:12.720 --> 35:17.760
I was waiting for you to be like, they traced it back to Pliny the Elder, and also it turns

35:17.760 --> 35:22.080
out that centaurs aren't real, so we've learned a lot today.

35:22.080 --> 35:25.760
This is just stupid shit where Alex is trying to scare his audience and sound smart.

35:25.760 --> 35:30.880
There's definitely reasons why people shouldn't overdo it with antibacterial hand soap and

35:30.880 --> 35:34.400
sanitizers, just for the sake of, you know, you don't want to.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.720
But like, what, does he never take antibiotics then?

35:36.720 --> 35:37.840
Yeah, no, never.

35:37.840 --> 35:38.960
Seems unwise.

35:38.960 --> 35:43.280
I don't like, people who, people like this shouldn't be allowed to enjoy the benefits

35:43.280 --> 35:44.320
of the future.

35:44.320 --> 35:48.000
If you're telling me that hand sanitizer, then you can't have anything!

35:48.000 --> 35:51.840
You can't have antibiotics, you can't have probiotics, you can't have your pills, you

35:51.840 --> 35:55.360
can't have any of this shit, because you, it's all based on the same shit!

35:55.360 --> 35:56.480
Yeah, you can't eat yogurt.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.760
Yeah, you can't have yogurt!

35:58.320 --> 35:59.440
No penicillin!

35:59.440 --> 35:59.940
Yeah.

36:00.960 --> 36:03.040
So, I think Alex would be fine with it.

36:03.040 --> 36:04.160
No, maybe not.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.360
It's tough to say.

36:05.360 --> 36:10.000
Although, I would like him to slowly be eaten alive by a foot fungus, that would be interesting.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.040
Well, that could never happen, because he takes his vitamins.

36:13.040 --> 36:13.920
Okay, good.

36:13.920 --> 36:15.760
It's good to wash your hands some.

36:15.760 --> 36:19.200
When you've been shaking a bunch of hands, whatever you never know, just because some

36:19.200 --> 36:21.520
people might have some bacteria that your body doesn't like.

36:21.520 --> 36:22.720
Wash your damn hands!

36:22.720 --> 36:28.000
With your wife, or people you know, we all make each other stronger, more bacteria is

36:28.000 --> 36:28.880
better, God bless you.

36:30.720 --> 36:35.280
Again, if you have all the vitamins and minerals you need, you basically cannot get communicable

36:35.280 --> 36:36.000
diseases.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.760
Viruses can't replicate, bacteria can't take over, if you're healthy.

36:39.760 --> 36:40.260
Wow.

36:42.160 --> 36:43.760
That is an irresponsible take.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.400
Just say you can pray out disease, Christ.

36:46.400 --> 36:49.760
Well, I mean, prayer and vitamins, he's basically Hulk Hogan.

36:49.760 --> 36:50.260
Yeah.

36:53.120 --> 36:53.680
Dr.

36:53.680 --> 36:55.360
Any carrots you'll be able to see.

36:55.360 --> 36:57.840
Dr. Bolia on the radio here.

36:57.840 --> 36:58.720
I hate people.

36:58.720 --> 37:02.240
Boy, and man, does Alex knock it out of the park with science on this episode.

37:02.240 --> 37:05.280
You know, we're genetically very similar to rats, we're more genetically similar to a

37:05.280 --> 37:07.040
rat or a pig than we are to a chimpanzee.

37:08.560 --> 37:08.960
Why do you think that?

37:08.960 --> 37:10.160
Some weird stuff going on, folks.

37:10.160 --> 37:10.640
Why?

37:10.640 --> 37:11.040
That's weird stuff.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.560
Why do you think that?

37:12.560 --> 37:12.880
Why?

37:14.160 --> 37:16.080
How can you say that out loud?

37:17.280 --> 37:18.400
It's not true.

37:18.400 --> 37:19.600
It is not true.

37:21.680 --> 37:22.880
You just can't believe...

37:24.080 --> 37:29.520
We're actually more genetically similar to rats and pigs than the thing that we literally

37:29.520 --> 37:30.960
directly evolved from.

37:30.960 --> 37:34.480
We're more similar to sticks than we are to each other.

37:34.480 --> 37:35.200
Fine.

37:35.200 --> 37:35.680
Whatever.

37:36.560 --> 37:37.440
Say words.

37:37.440 --> 37:38.240
Words, words, words.

37:38.240 --> 37:43.440
We are shockingly close to a lot of animals, and that's because there are a lot of things

37:43.440 --> 37:45.200
that are in common with us and animals.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.080
Right, right, right.

37:46.080 --> 37:47.680
Because we're animals.

37:47.680 --> 37:48.640
Because we are them.

37:48.640 --> 37:49.040
Yeah.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.480
We're mammals.

37:50.480 --> 37:54.720
And there's a theorized common ancestor way, way, way, way, way back.

37:54.720 --> 37:55.920
And a lot of those DNA...

37:55.920 --> 37:57.280
All 6,000 years back?

37:57.280 --> 37:57.520
Or...

37:58.160 --> 37:58.880
About 4,000.

37:58.880 --> 37:59.440
About 4,000?

37:59.440 --> 38:00.240
Okay, good.

38:00.240 --> 38:04.480
And a lot of the DNA, a lot of it does the same things.

38:04.480 --> 38:04.980
Yeah.

38:06.480 --> 38:07.840
Expresses in similar ways.

38:08.800 --> 38:13.760
But then certain mutations and such can then express in different ways, and what's more

38:13.760 --> 38:18.400
survivable in any given environment would then kind of win out over time, and those

38:18.400 --> 38:23.200
genes would continue to propagate until the cycle happens all over again, and over and

38:23.200 --> 38:25.520
over and over again for billions of years, right Dan?

38:25.520 --> 38:27.200
Yep, and that's how a rat became a human.

38:27.200 --> 38:28.240
Ah, shit.

38:28.240 --> 38:35.600
So Alex is talking to this caller, another caller, and it turns out that I think the

38:35.600 --> 38:38.480
globalists have another plan that we didn't know about.

38:38.480 --> 38:39.280
Plan C?

38:39.280 --> 38:40.640
It might be plan D.

38:40.640 --> 38:41.040
No!

38:41.040 --> 38:42.560
I don't know what plan this is anymore.

38:43.520 --> 38:46.320
But their plan is the Hunger Games.

38:46.320 --> 38:51.920
People see that and they think, oh, that's a woman talking about the UN.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.240
No, that's actually predictive programming.

38:54.240 --> 38:58.400
The actual plan the UN wants is a Hunger Games scenario.

38:58.400 --> 39:04.480
I read a UN biological diversity assessment report put out in the late 70s that Dr. Michael

39:04.480 --> 39:12.960
Kaufman told me about for Endgame, for Endgame 2.0, and in that it says we're going to bring

39:12.960 --> 39:17.680
back regions, we're going to bring back games like the Olympics, and we're going to bring

39:17.680 --> 39:22.320
back a CAS system, and people have to live in rural areas and have no technology or they'll

39:22.320 --> 39:27.040
live in these smart cities, highly controlled, and we're going to bring back human sacrifice

39:27.920 --> 39:29.040
at these games.

39:29.040 --> 39:29.440
Sure.

39:29.440 --> 39:34.880
And we're going to have floating fortresses with UN troops, everyone will be disarmed,

39:34.880 --> 39:40.720
and the global forces will be delivered by giant airships.

39:40.720 --> 39:41.600
I think that's Elysium.

39:43.760 --> 39:44.480
I would say...

39:44.480 --> 39:46.000
I think that was the Winter Soldier?

39:46.000 --> 39:48.960
I'm fucking tired of the globalists having so many plans.

39:48.960 --> 39:52.560
They have got to just pick one and stick to it.

39:52.560 --> 39:55.040
You know, execute your goddamn plan.

39:55.040 --> 39:56.560
This is why they're ten years behind.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.880
Oh god, just finish one!

39:58.880 --> 39:59.920
Finish one!

39:59.920 --> 40:02.160
It's like a weird dad in a hobby.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.720
Every week there's a new thing he does in the garage.

40:04.720 --> 40:07.360
It's like me back when I was trying to write short stories.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.600
Like I get two pages in, fuck it, I'm done.

40:10.720 --> 40:15.680
Yeah, hey globalist, I thought your plan was orderly killing off of people within a few

40:15.680 --> 40:20.400
years, and then if Alex is too good at his job, then there's Plan B with a super bioweapon,

40:20.400 --> 40:23.600
but that's not very good because it's not as fun for the globalists.

40:23.600 --> 40:24.480
They like order.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.920
They want to do things in an organized way.

40:27.920 --> 40:33.920
But apparently they want to bring about the Hunger Games, which doesn't seem like extermination.

40:33.920 --> 40:40.480
It seems like a situation where people are living in destitution while the elites live

40:40.480 --> 40:44.320
opulently and then people kill for entertainment.

40:44.320 --> 40:49.680
I haven't seen those movies, but I did see Battle Royale, so I figure it's the same thing.

40:49.680 --> 40:50.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.640
With slightly more story maybe.

40:52.640 --> 40:56.240
Uh, I mean, I might even go the opposite direction.

40:57.120 --> 40:57.840
I don't know.

40:57.840 --> 40:58.720
I would say...

40:58.720 --> 40:59.520
Why doesn't he ever...

41:00.320 --> 41:04.000
Like, I want him to just really dig into the weeds and start doing...

41:04.720 --> 41:09.200
Don't give me this popular bullshit that's written for young adults.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.560
Give me hard sci-fi.

41:10.560 --> 41:14.480
Tell me that it's going to be like a Heinlein book or fucking...

41:14.480 --> 41:18.160
Do you know what the globalist plan is?

41:18.160 --> 41:19.280
Snow Crash.

41:19.280 --> 41:20.000
That's what it's all about.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.920
It's all about Neal Stephenson now.

41:21.920 --> 41:23.280
That's what's going on.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.160
Let's do that.

41:24.160 --> 41:25.600
That's 2023.

41:25.600 --> 41:26.560
He's got to rebrand.

41:26.560 --> 41:27.520
That's fair.

41:27.520 --> 41:33.360
He's got to leave pockets of sci-fi untouched for when he needs to find a New Testament,

41:33.360 --> 41:33.840
more or less.

41:33.840 --> 41:34.960
That will get to Seven Eves.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.160
That's when it'll happen.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.080
I'm so sick and tired of this shit.

41:38.080 --> 41:38.640
Yeah.

41:38.640 --> 41:43.600
It's just, like, I want a coherent, like, narrative.

41:43.600 --> 41:44.160
Something.

41:44.160 --> 41:49.200
The bad guys are supposed to be working on the behalf of the fucking devil.

41:49.200 --> 41:49.700
Yeah.

41:50.160 --> 41:52.000
He's not a new character.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.600
Whom you can see.

41:53.600 --> 41:54.000
Yeah.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.200
You can see him.

41:55.200 --> 41:55.920
Open demons.

41:55.920 --> 41:56.720
If they've got the look.

41:56.720 --> 41:57.360
If they're open demons.

41:57.360 --> 41:58.240
If they're open demons.

41:58.240 --> 41:59.520
Closed demons, different story.

41:59.520 --> 42:00.320
Yeah, that's tough.

42:00.320 --> 42:00.820
Yeah.

42:01.360 --> 42:05.360
I would say that I've been studying them 27 years.

42:05.360 --> 42:07.520
The plan shouldn't keep changing around.

42:07.520 --> 42:08.240
Wow, they have to.

42:08.240 --> 42:09.200
Here's the bottom line.

42:09.200 --> 42:10.160
I'm playing games here.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.280
I'm playing Hunger Games.

42:11.280 --> 42:12.080
Nice.

42:12.080 --> 42:14.640
David Icke talks about the Hunger Games stuff all the time.

42:14.640 --> 42:15.120
Oh, okay.

42:15.120 --> 42:18.480
And so Alex is just ripping off David Icke because he's really into him right now.

42:18.480 --> 42:19.200
So annoying.

42:19.200 --> 42:25.760
But yeah, it's more annoying in terms of, like, I can't even trust Alex to be pretending

42:25.760 --> 42:26.880
to be serious about this.

42:26.880 --> 42:26.880
Yeah.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.200
And this is where I'm at, like, oh, yeah, sure.

42:31.200 --> 42:31.440
Okay.

42:32.080 --> 42:32.800
Yeah, I bet.

42:32.800 --> 42:33.200
I bet.

42:33.760 --> 42:34.800
Yeah, good, Alex.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.080
It just makes sense.

42:36.080 --> 42:41.440
I feel like I'm reading the first third of a new novel every week and never finishing

42:41.440 --> 42:43.280
it, and it's infuriating.

42:43.280 --> 42:44.480
It's infuriating.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.080
Yeah, and it points.

42:46.080 --> 42:47.200
It's kind of scary.

42:47.200 --> 42:48.640
Yeah, it's a little scary.

42:48.640 --> 42:49.120
That's fair.

42:49.120 --> 43:10.240
Like this of your wives and children now, the horsemen are drawing their let us teach

43:10.240 --> 43:13.280
a ride, and they're coming to take your life.

43:13.280 --> 43:17.200
So I'm going to ask you right now, what are you going to do about it?

43:19.600 --> 43:20.800
Not going to roll over, are you?

43:21.680 --> 43:22.640
That doesn't protect you.

43:24.400 --> 43:26.000
Choose your fate now.

43:27.120 --> 43:27.440
Yeah.

43:29.120 --> 43:30.240
Take it in your hands.

43:30.240 --> 43:32.480
You've been dying since the day you were born.

43:32.480 --> 43:33.840
You know, it's all been planned.

43:35.360 --> 43:36.800
Stop living on your knees.

43:38.560 --> 43:39.520
Fight on your feet.

43:39.520 --> 43:42.000
You've been dying since the day you were born.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.520
You know, it's all been planned.

43:46.480 --> 43:48.160
A sinner once, a sinner twice.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.680
You need no confessions now.

43:54.560 --> 43:55.280
You have to fight it.

43:55.280 --> 43:56.000
You're alive now.

44:00.080 --> 44:04.240
Just like all those children fought for their lives and those doctors chopped them up.

44:04.240 --> 44:05.600
You're going to have to fight now.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.960
You let the enemy go to the wall.

44:08.960 --> 44:14.880
We all let our own species down, and now we're going to be punished.

44:17.760 --> 44:24.160
And make no mistake, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Bill Gateses of the world,

44:24.160 --> 44:26.000
they will go into the fire as well.

44:27.680 --> 44:31.920
And their destruction will be the most painful and agonizing ever.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.280
They will be judged.

44:33.280 --> 44:40.960
Every man and every woman will be forced to kneel in front of God.

44:40.960 --> 44:46.400
I just, I find myself like, you know, while I'm sitting here not being able to take Alex

44:46.400 --> 44:50.960
seriously about just about anything he's saying, now getting into this like performative rant

44:50.960 --> 44:54.640
where it's like sort of, you know, it's song lyrics, but it's also in the context of his

44:54.640 --> 44:58.800
show, basically terrorist edging, just trying to get people like ramped up to commit acts

44:58.800 --> 44:59.280
of violence.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.000
You've been dying anyway.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.680
You know, like all that shit.

45:03.680 --> 45:08.800
And then it gets into like, you pair that with forced religious imagery.

45:08.800 --> 45:11.120
It's like, I don't, I can't stand this stuff.

45:11.120 --> 45:17.360
Like, I don't think I've ever encountered in my life a time when like religiosity matched

45:17.360 --> 45:21.520
with like open violence is a good combo.

45:21.520 --> 45:22.020
Yeah.

45:23.520 --> 45:29.920
Historically, just going back through my Rolodex of Second Crusade, that was, no, that wasn't

45:29.920 --> 45:30.400
a good one.

45:30.400 --> 45:33.200
No, that didn't go well.

45:36.240 --> 45:37.520
No, no, usually bad.

45:37.520 --> 45:37.920
Yeah.

45:37.920 --> 45:38.160
Yeah.

45:38.160 --> 45:39.120
You're going to have to go with that.

45:39.120 --> 45:45.920
It just, I know this is performative and I know that Alex, like he doesn't even, he's,

45:45.920 --> 45:47.120
he thinks this is a joke.

45:47.120 --> 45:47.520
Yeah.

45:47.520 --> 45:49.280
Like he's fucking with his audience.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.240
Like, and I can tell because like, listen to this.

45:53.200 --> 45:59.440
President pretender elect Joe Biden can act powerful all day long.

45:59.440 --> 46:03.520
But he's a nobody and he will be brought low.

46:04.400 --> 46:05.680
He will be broken.

46:07.440 --> 46:17.040
He will beg the almighty and God will tell him the door is closed.

46:17.840 --> 46:19.360
You are damned to hell.

46:19.360 --> 46:19.760
Cool.

46:19.760 --> 46:21.120
Then leave him alone until then.

46:23.120 --> 46:24.240
Damned to hell.

46:25.200 --> 46:25.840
All right.

46:25.840 --> 46:27.920
But Joe Biden knows he's damned to hell.

46:27.920 --> 46:29.520
Cool.

46:29.520 --> 46:36.400
He just wants to take you where they, so thank your lucky stars every day that you're not

46:36.400 --> 46:44.240
Joe Biden or Bill Gates or any of these people who are prepared for their own annihilation

46:44.240 --> 46:46.480
and are just trying to drag us down with them.

46:46.480 --> 46:48.000
All right, let's go back to your phone calls here.

46:52.640 --> 46:53.600
All right.

46:53.600 --> 46:58.640
All right, everybody, we're getting back to phone calls on the 9, 6 40 AM.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.840
And all right.

46:59.840 --> 47:04.160
Our next topic today is who's going to burn in the fires of hell.

47:04.160 --> 47:04.660
Yeah.

47:05.520 --> 47:09.520
I'm going to pretend to really care about this, but it's all an act.

47:09.520 --> 47:16.960
I'm putting on a fucking spooky voice to scare you and get you excited about Joe Biden burning

47:16.960 --> 47:17.520
in hell.

47:19.040 --> 47:19.600
Give it away.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.560
Free tickets.

47:20.560 --> 47:21.840
Yeah, exactly.

47:21.840 --> 47:24.640
Anyways, what are we up to?

47:24.640 --> 47:26.640
Aerosmiths coming to the pavilion.

47:27.840 --> 47:29.040
Yeah, this is so stupid.

47:29.040 --> 47:29.520
Yeah.

47:29.520 --> 47:34.480
Anyway, why do you think is a good reason to overthrow the government?

47:36.880 --> 47:39.920
Like taxation without representation is one from American history.

47:39.920 --> 47:40.160
Right.

47:40.160 --> 47:42.560
I was going to go with a real bad Thursday.

47:42.560 --> 47:44.560
Thursdays are usually pretty rough.

47:44.560 --> 47:45.920
You just got to take a nap, man.

47:45.920 --> 47:46.400
Yeah.

47:46.400 --> 47:47.840
Well, a nap would also work.

47:48.720 --> 47:49.360
Let's see.

47:49.360 --> 47:52.080
I will say that in terms of slavery is a good one.

47:52.080 --> 47:52.560
Sure.

47:52.560 --> 47:54.800
I'm pretty sure Haiti had the right idea.

47:54.800 --> 48:00.320
I would say that those are both better than what this caller is going through.

48:00.320 --> 48:00.720
Okay.

48:00.720 --> 48:04.960
This caller wants to overthrow the federal government, and I will say that their grievance

48:04.960 --> 48:06.560
list is small.

48:06.560 --> 48:07.280
Okay.

48:07.280 --> 48:11.120
And I really just called you because we're just getting sick and tired of it, man.

48:11.120 --> 48:16.640
I had to go to my girlfriend's Christmas celebration with masks on 60 away from everybody.

48:16.640 --> 48:22.800
No, I really think this area is ready to not have a federal government anymore.

48:22.800 --> 48:23.200
Everyone.

48:23.200 --> 48:23.680
I agree.

48:23.680 --> 48:27.600
But I mean, I would speak out at that Christmas party and show people the evidence of fraud

48:27.600 --> 48:31.760
and how mass caused bacterial pneumonia privilege, man.

48:31.760 --> 48:34.880
And just because they think they're nurses, they think they know everything.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.200
Well, you know, most of the nurses say that it's all a fraud to scam.

48:39.200 --> 48:40.720
So these must be really young nurses.

48:41.840 --> 48:43.520
One is her grandma.

48:43.520 --> 48:45.520
And one of them is like a 30 year old woman.

48:45.520 --> 48:46.160
I don't know.

48:46.160 --> 48:47.520
They're both pretty liberal.

48:47.520 --> 48:48.640
They both voted for.

48:48.640 --> 48:49.280
I mean, that's it.

48:49.280 --> 48:49.600
No, no.

48:49.600 --> 48:53.360
They know it's about their power, and they're making everybody wear a burka.

48:53.360 --> 48:59.280
So Alex has realized, like, oh, no, I've set out this talking point that all the nurses

48:59.280 --> 49:02.480
are against the vaccine, but these two nurses are for it.

49:02.480 --> 49:03.440
So they must be young.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.200
Oh, wait, they're not young.

49:05.200 --> 49:08.400
Oh, they must be really liberal because that's how they want to express their power.

49:09.360 --> 49:10.560
Just don't go to the Christmas party.

49:11.360 --> 49:14.640
It's like he's got a check down list of like, oh, this must be the most.

49:14.640 --> 49:14.960
Nope.

49:14.960 --> 49:15.680
Okay.

49:15.680 --> 49:18.400
It's like he's a fucking psychic.

49:18.400 --> 49:22.240
It's like you go to that psychic and they're like, oh, I see some loss in your past.

49:22.240 --> 49:23.280
No, I haven't lost.

49:23.280 --> 49:24.720
Ah, but you're going to lose.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.560
I'll be like, fuck off, man.

49:26.560 --> 49:27.120
Yeah.

49:27.120 --> 49:30.960
And in order to trick you from realizing that they've been wrong about a bunch of things,

49:30.960 --> 49:34.320
usually this mentalist will switch topics a little bit.

49:34.320 --> 49:37.680
And Alex does that by talking about these nurses and gender roles.

49:38.400 --> 49:39.840
And I'm not putting women down.

49:39.840 --> 49:44.480
Some women statistically are as mathematically smart as men.

49:44.480 --> 49:46.880
They are more aggressive than men.

49:46.880 --> 49:48.160
They're more dynamic.

49:48.160 --> 49:51.280
On average, men are more mathematical.

49:51.280 --> 49:52.720
Men are more aggressive.

49:52.720 --> 49:53.920
Men don't bow as much.

49:53.920 --> 49:57.840
Men have been taught to be domesticated slugs, let their wives and girlfriends work for them.

49:58.480 --> 50:00.960
And women have been taught to comply with the system.

50:02.800 --> 50:06.000
And so that's why we're being led into bondage by women.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.920
Just as the Bible says will happen in the end times.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.000
But that's not women's fault.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.200
That's men's fault for not being leaders.

50:13.200 --> 50:14.160
Holy shit.

50:14.160 --> 50:14.480
Wow.

50:15.360 --> 50:15.760
Wild.

50:16.720 --> 50:17.680
Wild stuff.

50:19.360 --> 50:20.320
Oh my God.

50:20.320 --> 50:23.920
You ever hear somebody just start saying something and then you're like,

50:23.920 --> 50:25.600
oh my God, you actually believe that?

50:25.600 --> 50:26.000
Yeah.

50:26.000 --> 50:26.800
That's insane.

50:26.800 --> 50:28.160
That's an insane thing you just said.

50:28.160 --> 50:29.360
You should be slapped in the face.

50:29.360 --> 50:29.600
Yeah.

50:29.600 --> 50:30.960
You should be slapped in the face.

50:30.960 --> 50:31.280
Yeah.

50:31.280 --> 50:36.240
He's basically saying that like women by leading are fucking everything up,

50:36.240 --> 50:37.440
but it's not their fault.

50:37.440 --> 50:38.720
Men should have put them in their place.

50:38.720 --> 50:39.280
Yep.

50:39.280 --> 50:39.440
Yep.

50:40.240 --> 50:41.120
What the fuck?

50:41.120 --> 50:45.520
Just just just just come out and be like, I don't think we should have given them the right to vote.

50:45.520 --> 50:46.320
Just say it.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.800
I would bet that he would think that's creeping communism.

50:50.800 --> 50:52.320
Why would you give women the right to vote?

50:52.320 --> 50:54.480
They're just going to vote the way their husbands do.

50:54.480 --> 50:55.200
Duh.

50:55.200 --> 50:57.280
You're just going to double all existing votes.

50:57.280 --> 50:58.000
Exactly.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.760
We don't even need to worry about it.

51:00.880 --> 51:02.240
So that was shocking.

51:02.240 --> 51:03.040
I mean, it's not shocking.

51:03.040 --> 51:05.120
No, that's not shocking in its bluntness.

51:05.120 --> 51:09.360
Hey, welcome back to Harrison Smith and I'm down for the casual misogyny hour.

51:09.360 --> 51:11.840
Everybody, what are we doing this morning?

51:11.840 --> 51:13.440
Women should not have rights.

51:16.160 --> 51:21.040
So we have one last caller here on this New Year's Eve show.

51:21.040 --> 51:21.600
Okay.

51:21.600 --> 51:24.640
And this guy has got an interesting idea about what to do

51:25.280 --> 51:28.640
on the sixth because they're doing this rally right down in DC.

51:28.640 --> 51:29.200
Yes, they are.

51:29.200 --> 51:30.720
This guy's got a novel idea.

51:31.280 --> 51:36.560
Just want to touch bases with you with the March on DC or the occupation of DC.

51:36.560 --> 51:41.200
I think that you I'm going to talk to all the Cajun Navy and all

51:41.200 --> 51:46.160
these people that did vote parade for the past three to four months.

51:46.800 --> 51:52.000
We need to have every single one of those people plug up the Potomac.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.240
Because that is a genius idea.

51:58.240 --> 52:00.960
Well, I can set out some Facebook posts and stuff.

52:00.960 --> 52:01.360
Okay.

52:01.360 --> 52:01.840
Yeah, good.

52:01.840 --> 52:05.360
We're going to get some Facebook Facebook posts going to the Cajun

52:05.360 --> 52:10.080
Navy. Yes, yes.

52:10.080 --> 52:11.600
I am fine with these plans.

52:11.600 --> 52:13.120
These are my favorite plans.

52:13.120 --> 52:15.760
Pick something stupid and stick to it.

52:15.760 --> 52:18.000
Like, it's just going to inconvenience you guys.

52:18.000 --> 52:18.560
Exactly.

52:18.560 --> 52:19.680
You're going to sink each other.

52:19.680 --> 52:20.640
They're stupid.

52:21.760 --> 52:22.080
Yes.

52:22.720 --> 52:25.280
Somebody is going to accuse a boat of being Antifa.

52:25.280 --> 52:26.240
Everybody's going to drown.

52:26.240 --> 52:26.720
Totally.

52:29.200 --> 52:32.320
I don't like being taken over by the dumbest people on the planet, Dan.

52:32.320 --> 52:34.240
This plan is too complicated for y'all.

52:34.240 --> 52:40.480
Yes, it's unfortunate that I want to, like, in an almost parental way,

52:40.480 --> 52:43.600
just be like, and here's how you overthrow the government, guys.

52:43.600 --> 52:44.640
This is a terrible...

52:44.640 --> 52:45.280
No, shit!

52:45.280 --> 52:45.840
I couldn't have...

52:45.840 --> 52:46.960
Oh, God damn it.

52:46.960 --> 52:52.240
So I would say that the New Year's Eve Day show and the New Year's Day

52:52.240 --> 52:57.200
show themselves are not, like, really that special.

52:57.200 --> 53:00.000
There's not really a feeling of, like, new beginnings.

53:00.000 --> 53:07.600
Alex does ask on the 31st for people to call in and say their New Year's resolution.

53:07.600 --> 53:08.000
Sure.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.400
It's not much meaningful shit there, but...

53:10.400 --> 53:12.320
I resolved to overthrow the government!

53:13.680 --> 53:14.240
By boat!

53:17.440 --> 53:21.200
So we get to the first, and it's just another show.

53:21.200 --> 53:22.720
It's not like a New Year's show.

53:22.720 --> 53:23.120
Yeah.

53:23.120 --> 53:23.680
There's nothing.

53:23.680 --> 53:28.320
There's no bells or whistles about it, except an amazing roster of guests.

53:28.320 --> 53:29.360
Okay.

53:29.360 --> 53:33.440
And Alex realizing it's probably going to be impossible for Trump to win this election.

53:33.440 --> 53:34.080
All right.

53:34.080 --> 53:37.760
The head of Roger Stone with major exclusive information joining us,

53:37.760 --> 53:41.120
and Robert Barnes with major exclusive information.

53:41.120 --> 53:42.880
He's been working since the election.

53:44.000 --> 53:44.640
Sure he has.

53:44.640 --> 53:47.360
For President Trump, going all across the country.

53:47.360 --> 53:48.400
You've got to stop saying that.

53:48.400 --> 53:52.320
He was there in Georgia with us and other areas, but he was off the radar then.

53:52.320 --> 53:52.960
Sure he was.

53:52.960 --> 53:58.800
And he can really give you the serious path to victory that Trump still has,

53:58.800 --> 54:03.840
but it is a narrowing window like in Indiana Jones, Raiders of the Lost Ark,

54:03.840 --> 54:08.000
where he rolls under as the wall lowers down and closes,

54:08.000 --> 54:10.880
and reaches through and grabs his whip right as it slams shut.

54:10.880 --> 54:18.240
I mean, it's like a Robin Hood shot now of firing the arrow and splitting the arrow.

54:19.920 --> 54:21.600
You know, I've actually done that quite a few times.

54:21.600 --> 54:23.360
Get the fuck out!

54:23.360 --> 54:25.040
Shut the fuck up!

54:25.040 --> 54:26.160
Shut the fuck up!

54:26.160 --> 54:27.680
Just shut the fuck up!

54:27.680 --> 54:30.000
Shut up!

54:30.000 --> 54:31.760
It was a little bragging.

54:31.760 --> 54:34.240
A little unnecessarily bragging.

54:34.240 --> 54:35.600
I couldn't handle that one.

54:35.600 --> 54:37.760
I'm sorry for screaming, but that was just too much.

54:37.760 --> 54:38.240
Yeah.

54:38.240 --> 54:39.040
That was just too much.

54:39.040 --> 54:40.640
I've heard him say too much shit.

54:40.640 --> 54:43.280
There is something nonsensical about him being like,

54:43.280 --> 54:47.120
all right, I'm going to come up with an example of an incredibly difficult thing to do,

54:47.120 --> 54:48.800
which by the way, I've done a bunch of times.

54:48.800 --> 54:49.760
So easily.

54:49.760 --> 54:52.080
God damn it, I hate him so much.

54:52.080 --> 54:52.640
What a dick.

54:52.640 --> 54:53.760
How could someone...

54:53.760 --> 54:55.840
I've listened to him say he can do too much shit.

54:55.840 --> 54:56.160
Yeah.

54:56.160 --> 54:59.840
You can't Forrest Gump your way into I'm Robin Hood 2.

54:59.840 --> 55:04.800
I've got bad news for Alex about Trump's agility score.

55:04.800 --> 55:05.280
Yeah.

55:05.280 --> 55:08.560
Don't think he's going to be diving under any doors and getting his bullwhip.

55:08.560 --> 55:12.480
He's got a crossbow and he's going to lean forward and doing that stand thing that he

55:12.480 --> 55:14.800
does that makes him look like a weird fucking horse.

55:14.800 --> 55:15.680
I think he might get...

55:16.720 --> 55:18.560
He's not going to roll well on that guy.

55:18.560 --> 55:19.520
No, I doubt it.

55:19.520 --> 55:25.520
So this is probably my second favorite thing on this January 1st episode.

55:25.520 --> 55:30.160
I will say we end with fantastic and maybe worth the episode on its own.

55:30.160 --> 55:30.480
Okay.

55:30.480 --> 55:31.760
And I'm not talking about Roger Stone.

55:31.760 --> 55:32.400
Okay, good.

55:32.400 --> 55:36.880
But this was a little much for me in a way that I enjoy.

55:36.880 --> 55:38.240
It's good, but it's a little much.

55:38.240 --> 55:38.880
Okay.

55:38.880 --> 55:44.800
The social engineers have noticed that most people, when they're part of a crime,

55:47.200 --> 55:51.920
when they're part of something corrupt, when they get manipulated into doing something

55:51.920 --> 55:55.840
wrong, they don't say they're wrong.

55:55.840 --> 56:01.840
They decide to get even more delusional and to sign on to even more excesses and more

56:01.840 --> 56:02.400
extremes.

56:03.520 --> 56:03.840
Yeah.

56:04.400 --> 56:09.680
And there's many examples of this that you could point out throughout history, but it's

56:09.680 --> 56:10.960
a well-known phenomenon.

56:10.960 --> 56:11.600
Right in front of you.

56:11.600 --> 56:17.520
And the one that I've personally experienced is you with coworkers and even not distant

56:17.520 --> 56:19.520
family, but not really close family.

56:19.520 --> 56:20.080
No, you.

56:20.080 --> 56:21.440
I'm very embarrassed about it.

56:21.440 --> 56:22.400
You specifically.

56:22.400 --> 56:23.600
His online scams.

56:24.240 --> 56:27.120
Everybody knows about Nigerian email scams.

56:27.120 --> 56:31.680
They're one of the most popular, one of the most prolific, but there's lots of groups

56:31.680 --> 56:32.480
doing it.

56:32.480 --> 56:39.040
And you get an email that, hey, the royal bloodline of Prince Abubu wants to give you

56:39.040 --> 56:40.000
a thousand dollars.

56:42.640 --> 56:47.440
He's got money locked up, millions in this bank account, but he is unable because of

56:47.440 --> 56:49.040
sanctions to get it out or whatever.

56:49.040 --> 56:53.520
If you'll just give him a thousand dollars, you will be given $20,000.

56:55.200 --> 57:00.400
And when you give them the thousand, they go, well, he's ready to give you even more

57:00.400 --> 57:04.400
money, but he needs 5,000 more, but now he's going to give you a half million.

57:06.640 --> 57:10.240
And usually most people, once they've given a thousand, they don't want to admit they

57:10.240 --> 57:10.960
got conned.

57:10.960 --> 57:13.200
They give the larger amount.

57:13.200 --> 57:18.560
And then if you've already given them like 20, $30,000, a Cadillac will pull up at your

57:18.560 --> 57:21.920
house because they've got, you know, some of the guys in the scam all over the country.

57:21.920 --> 57:25.520
They'll be in royal robes and say, I am the representative of Prince Abubu.

57:25.520 --> 57:26.720
He thanks you graciously.

57:26.720 --> 57:30.480
Let's make a phone call to him and he will graciously thank you from Nigeria.

57:30.480 --> 57:33.120
And, and, and some people will mortgage their house.

57:33.120 --> 57:36.640
They have a hundred thousand dollars to Prince Abubu because now Prince Abubu is going to

57:36.640 --> 57:38.080
give you a 50 million.

57:38.080 --> 57:38.960
50 million.

57:43.280 --> 57:47.600
And again, I knew a guy, a GCN talk show host that said, I'm being offered a hundred thousand

57:47.600 --> 57:49.120
dollars by Nigerians.

57:49.120 --> 57:50.560
I've already given them 5,000.

57:51.280 --> 57:53.840
And I called the guy and I said, that's a scam, bro.

57:53.840 --> 57:54.880
Are you joking?

57:54.880 --> 57:55.840
Or are you part of this?

57:57.200 --> 57:58.320
And he said, screw you.

57:58.320 --> 57:59.200
You're just jealous.

57:59.200 --> 58:00.160
I'm going to get all this money.

58:00.160 --> 58:01.840
And then he actually got ripped off.

58:03.440 --> 58:05.920
As opposed to the other possibility radio host.

58:05.920 --> 58:10.720
I'm certain Alex has to be talking about himself.

58:10.720 --> 58:13.440
There's the only, he's the only person who could be talking about.

58:13.440 --> 58:18.240
He's so uncreative about like, Oh, this guy was a GCN radio host.

58:18.240 --> 58:19.360
So many details.

58:19.360 --> 58:23.120
I guess the alternative is, Hey, Alex should wrestle with the fact that his buddy, Ted

58:23.120 --> 58:28.000
Anderson would hire a guy and have him as a host to someone who would fall for the Nigerian

58:28.000 --> 58:29.440
email scam that hard.

58:29.440 --> 58:30.240
Yeah.

58:30.240 --> 58:37.600
I don't know if I've ever heard of anybody having a car pull up and in person scammers

58:37.600 --> 58:38.160
show up.

58:38.160 --> 58:39.040
I've never seen that one.

58:39.040 --> 58:41.600
No, because they know that that would probably be a sting.

58:41.600 --> 58:44.640
It would be a bad idea for the scammers to show up.

58:44.640 --> 58:45.120
Yeah.

58:45.120 --> 58:48.800
Because this is primarily because if you're scamming over long distance.

58:48.800 --> 58:48.960
Yeah.

58:48.960 --> 58:49.360
Yeah.

58:49.360 --> 58:50.640
Maybe even in another country.

58:50.640 --> 58:50.960
Yeah.

58:50.960 --> 58:51.520
Yeah.

58:51.520 --> 58:53.600
This is a, this is a bad idea.

58:53.600 --> 58:54.960
I wouldn't do that if I were them.

58:54.960 --> 59:01.920
This is not, this isn't something that escalates to like, let's do this in person because there's

59:01.920 --> 59:02.800
no reason to.

59:02.800 --> 59:08.400
No, you understand that that would be like, the only way that could work is if a reverse

59:08.400 --> 59:12.480
scam of the scammers was possible where they're like, Holy shit, we're going to get so much

59:12.480 --> 59:13.600
money out of this guy.

59:13.600 --> 59:15.680
We got to show up at his place.

59:15.680 --> 59:16.240
Yes.

59:16.240 --> 59:19.120
That would be the same scam in reverse.

59:19.120 --> 59:19.840
Yeah.

59:19.840 --> 59:21.680
I actually did some looking into this.

59:21.680 --> 59:25.200
I read the page on the FBI's website about this scam.

59:25.200 --> 59:27.760
Like, like, you know, the warning signs and stuff.

59:27.760 --> 59:28.880
I read a couple other things.

59:28.880 --> 59:33.200
I can't find any indication that it escalates to a guy showing up at your house.

59:34.240 --> 59:35.040
I don't know.

59:35.040 --> 59:38.320
That doesn't seem like, it seems like a different scam.

59:38.320 --> 59:41.920
We should hire somebody to show up at Alex's house.

59:41.920 --> 59:43.520
Just a Nigerian prince.

59:43.520 --> 59:48.000
Well, I, I gotta, he does always say Prince of Boo Boo.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.400
And I know that that feels racist.

59:50.400 --> 59:50.720
It is.

59:50.720 --> 59:51.600
He is a racist.

59:51.600 --> 59:56.480
So it feels like that could just be a name he's making up, but he always uses that name.

59:56.480 --> 59:57.840
Well, it's very specific.

59:57.840 --> 01:00:03.360
It's the name of, uh, uh, well, I mean, isn't it from Aladdin?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.160
Isn't that the insult name that Jafar, he calls him Prince of Boo Boo.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:08.800
Oh, does he?

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.520
Yes, he does.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.400
Oh shit.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.280
I didn't realize that.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.560
I haven't seen that in a long time.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.640
I'm pretty sure that's Ali Ababwa.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:14.960
Yeah.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.680
Yeah.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.000
Yeah.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.360
So then he, he insults his name like this.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.080
Interesting.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:20.560
Yeah.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.600
That, that's, I don't know why that poll is so easy for me.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.400
Well, I don't know.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.840
I haven't, I haven't seen it in a long time and it does make sense that something would

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.560
come from a movie.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:28.800
Yeah.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.120
Yeah.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.080
That makes sense.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:30.480
All right.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.760
We've, we've sorted this out.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.240
Okay.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.040
Alex has almost certainly been scammed by, uh, that.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.120
I don't know about the car though.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.400
I think that seems, that seems like he might've just dreamt it.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:45.360
That seems his, uh, his embellishment kind of storytelling style, but everything else

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.600
seems very suspiciously accurate.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.480
So this vaccine, um, you know what it is?

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.640
It's the mark of the beast.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.440
Again?

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.440
This is the whole world government agenda.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.480
This is the mark of the beast.

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.080
This is the tracking system.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:58.720
This is it.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:04.880
And yes, Trump has failed at this critical juncture on this critical issue.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.000
He has gone along with it.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.840
And I, I thought he was doing that to take control of the agenda from him.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:10.640
Cause I made that up.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.720
Which partially they've done.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.280
And I understand that Trump's not a scientist.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.240
It doesn't matter.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.280
Trump won the election.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.640
The Democrats are trying to steal it.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.320
They want him out of the way because Joe Biden is 500 times worse.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.520
So I support Trump.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.320
Okay.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:24.720
Yeah.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:29.520
All that stuff about like Trump is putting out the Pfizer vaccine to cut off Bill Gates

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.200
with his MR and RNA.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.800
I was just making all that stuff up.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.680
I was just talking shit to find a way to support Trump, even though he was in favor of the

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.560
vaccine.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:39.360
So I had to do that.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.680
That was the only way that I could really thread the needle.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.840
And now I look like an idiot, so I pretend I never said that, but I do have to, I mean,

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:50.240
my callers do know that I said that Trump was trying to play 3d chess or 4d chess with

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.040
the vaccine.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.840
So now I gotta be like, ah, well, Trump is wrong on this one.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.600
Uh oh, he gave us the mark of the beast.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:56.000
Sure.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.280
But you gotta support him cause Biden would give you 50 marks of the beast.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.080
Love it.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:00.800
I love it.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:01.440
So dumb.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.120
I just love how stupid it is.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:03.440
Yeah.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:08.960
And, and literally, literally immediately after he's talking about how people will double

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.440
down rather than admit they got conned.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.160
He's literally doing exactly that.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:14.640
Yeah.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.840
Except he conned himself.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.080
Yeah.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.960
He is both the recipient and the sender of the Nigerian scam email.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:21.460
Yeah.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:26.560
But, uh, I think, you know, which also wouldn't surprise me too much if that was true in real

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:31.680
life as well, a Nigerian scam email.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.180
Yeah.

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:39.680
I think that if I find it difficult to understand what you gain by having Trump in office, if

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:43.280
Trump being in office still facilitated the rise of the devil.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:43.780
Yep.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:44.260
I do.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:49.620
If, if the goal is averting the mark of the beast and Trump ushered everyone into and

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:52.580
did not protect you from the mark of the beast or whatever.

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:52.980
Yeah.

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:55.700
Seems like he sucks and you shouldn't support him either.

01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:56.200
Yeah.

01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:57.800
Yeah.

01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:59.060
That would make sense.

01:02:59.060 --> 01:02:59.460
Yeah.

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:04.340
I think we, I think if I was in government, I would officially name something the mark

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:08.500
of the beast just cause I'm so sick of everything being the mark of the beast.

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:08.900
Oh yeah.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.260
Like the mark of the beast act or something.

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:10.660
Yeah.

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:11.460
Something like that.

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.540
Just literally like, Hey, guess what?

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.540
This is your lucky day, Christians.

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.300
This is the mark of the beast.

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.940
And it would just be like a bill to name a library or something.

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:20.820
Totally.

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:21.700
Absolutely.

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.860
And then, then we wouldn't have to deal with all this.

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:25.380
Well, the vaccine is the mark of the beast.

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:26.900
Well, the barcodes is the mark of the beast.

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:28.020
Well, your phone's the mark of the beast.

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:28.660
I'm sick of it.

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:29.160
Yeah.

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.540
So Alex takes a bunch of calls on this show too.

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:36.340
Like I think he's just sort of like, yeah, let's just take all easy content, whatever.

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:37.460
That's kind of a vacation.

01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:40.100
These people are tough to deal with.

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:40.340
Yeah.

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:41.060
That's fair.

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:45.060
I would not consider a vacation talking to Alex's audience.

01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:45.780
Fair enough.

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.540
Um, this guy is terrified.

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:48.100
Okay.

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:52.340
Just want to let you know, I used to call in as Jason from Germany, um, but I had to

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:56.260
get my family out of Germany, brought them back to the States after Trump was reelected

01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:59.060
because I remember you've been calling for what, four or five years.

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:00.340
Yes, sir.

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.220
I've been listening longer than that, but I had to get my family out because of the

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:04.740
invasion, which you're well aware of.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.500
And, uh, the Islamic invasion.

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:12.180
Yes, sir, uh, brought my family here back to my home state of Oregon, which I love and

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.540
wanted to put down roots in.

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:15.460
Unfortunately, as you know, it didn't work out here.

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:21.540
The West coast appears to be become, have, have become aligned with Chinese interests

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:22.500
more than anything else.

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.460
Oh no.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:27.140
Wow, dude, you are fucking up your whole life.

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:31.860
This guy had to flee Germany because apparently the Muslims have invaded Germany.

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:36.740
He gets home to the West coast only to find that it is under Chinese control.

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.900
This guy can't catch a break.

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.220
This is our modern day Odysseus.

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.900
That is what we're dealing with right here.

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:48.100
He gets home only to find that his wife has left him.

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:53.620
I honestly also kept thinking while I was listening to this, I don't know, maybe it's

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:59.140
just the mood I'm in, but I kept thinking, grow up just to everybody, to Alex, to these

01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:00.820
callers, just grow the fuck up.

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:01.700
What are you guys doing?

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:07.860
Um, well, it's just too much larping.

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.300
It's all larping.

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:12.500
It's so, it's so like, I get it.

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.820
Real life is often boring.

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:16.420
It's repetitive.

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:21.860
Not much is going on, especially now, but you can't live like you're in a fucking

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:25.380
spy movie and the Muslims are invading Germany.

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:25.860
Sure.

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:26.740
Come on, man.

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:31.220
I think, I think a certain amount of it is probably motivated by people recognizing

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:39.220
how difficult a time in history this is and how relatively easy some people have it and

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:42.660
needing to not feel the guilt of that.

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:48.020
And so you trans, you, you take that and you sort of transform it into, well, obviously

01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:49.540
the Chinese run the West coast.

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:50.580
Sure, sure.

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:54.100
And I better run away from the Chinese occupied territory.

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:54.580
Fine.

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:54.740
Right.

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:58.340
Cause that's the way, that's the way you can experience some of the actual pain that

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:02.740
so many other people are living without having to actually face it.

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:08.100
Or feel like you're sharing pain with people who you actively are told to hate.

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:14.820
Or recognize that you are a part of the system that maintains that status quo.

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:15.320
Totally.

01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:18.100
I guess it's more fun this way.

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:24.020
So Alex takes another call and this, this guy is like really, really laying it out there.

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:25.860
What Infowars is all about.

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:29.860
I know it's a little off subject, but you would be one of the best preachers.

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:34.180
If you could just take like, maybe like, I don't know what day you do it on, but maybe

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.540
once a week, once a month.

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:42.740
But you were the person that got me through politics to finally accept Jesus as my savior.

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.580
And I'm not, I'm not trying to say that to be silly.

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.540
It's really true.

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:51.860
It was first politics, but I did realize that it's about, you know, what we wrestle not

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:56.980
with against flesh and blood, against principalities, powers, you know how it goes.

01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:57.480
You know?

01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:58.600
Yeah.

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:01.380
This is the second call within these two days.

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:04.580
I didn't even cut the first one because it was just kind of like, well, it's just another

01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:06.500
person saying that Alex brought him to God.

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:11.700
But it is a bunch there, like two people within two days calling in being like, you through

01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:14.820
politics, you Trojan horse religion to me.

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:19.140
And that's, I mean, Hey, look, if people want to be religious, like I, like I always try

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.300
and try and say, I'm not against religion.

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:21.860
Yeah.

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:24.740
I find this to be a fraud.

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:33.060
I find this to be a con that Alex is doing where it's this extremist version of Christianity

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:39.300
in maybe in quotes that you can arrive to by way of extreme right-wing politics.

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.980
And you know what?

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:42.740
It's not even really religion.

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:48.420
It's still politics, but it has the verve and the zeal of religiosity.

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:51.860
Wherein now all of your political enemies are demons.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:52.180
Yeah.

01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:54.420
And you can see it because you have discernment now.

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:54.740
Right.

01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:58.820
It's, it's that it's, it's a, it's a two staged charade.

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:03.460
I mean, religion is the escalation of political violence in a way.

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:07.780
Just that sense of like, Oh, my purpose is so much bigger.

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:12.340
You know, I used to be politically active where I wanted to affect the country and the

01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:14.420
government and the way my city was run.

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:16.900
But now I'm not just affecting that.

01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:17.940
I'm affecting the world.

01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:19.300
And I'm not just affecting the world.

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.860
I'm affecting the entire universe.

01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:22.500
Right, right, right.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:22.900
Yeah.

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:25.060
That is a path that that can go.

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:27.060
That is not what religion is entirely.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:27.780
No, no, no, no.

01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:28.500
Absolutely.

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.500
That is a way that it can manifest.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:35.380
And it's, it's the, it's the path that Alex thrives on.

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:36.980
And it's really, it's really a bummer.

01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:37.300
Yeah.

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:42.100
Particularly because like you're seeing like these people are just like living in a completely

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:43.380
different world than everyone else.

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:43.940
Totally.

01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:47.700
They're like, this guy had to flee Germany because the Muslims invaded.

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:49.780
And the Chinese are running the West Coast.

01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:50.260
Yeah, no.

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:54.740
Prosperity gospel preachers should be immediately arrested and imprisoned for life.

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.740
Like every part of that is fucked.

01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:56.980
Yeah.

01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:57.860
And then listen to this.

01:08:57.860 --> 01:09:02.980
Alex is like, this is the kind of reality that Alex wants to live in and wants to perpetuate

01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:03.780
for his audience.

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:09.140
I told you 16 years ago that a friend of mine is a big movie producer, was talking to James

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:13.140
Cameron and James Cameron said, yeah, we were going to roll out new movie theaters where

01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.460
you sit in a circle around it and it's a hologram.

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:16.900
But the decision was made in the future.

01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:18.260
There won't even be movies anymore.

01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:22.420
So I'm moving to New Zealand for the end of the world, and I'm going to get all these

01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:28.180
ships and things so that it looks like I'm, you can write it off as an ocean oceanic researcher,

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:34.340
but really in case even New Zealand falls, I've got a fleet of ships during the depopulation

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:34.980
operation.

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:35.460
Sure.

01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:41.860
Remember I told you that 15, 16 years ago and now he admits basically all of that.

01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:43.300
What does basically mean?

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:51.940
So if I understand this correctly, movie producer talking to James Cameron, James Cameron's

01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:53.620
like, hey, you remember Titanic?

01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:54.660
And he's like, yes, I do.

01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:57.220
We're going to watch it in holograms.

01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:58.500
And he was like, that sounds cool.

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:02.420
And then he was like, psych, movies aren't even going to exist.

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:07.700
So the movie producer realizing that he doesn't have a job later on in life was like, oh,

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:11.860
obviously what I'll do is scam New Zealand's tax system.

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:14.660
So I'll have a fleet of ships.

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:18.900
Also, keep telling people you're going to put out those avatar sequels, even though

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.500
there will be no movies.

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:21.460
You're still going to need it.

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:21.960
Yeah.

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:26.580
I want to know what elements of that has been basically admitted to.

01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:28.580
I don't know.

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:29.080
By who?

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:30.900
Great question.

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.420
Did New Zealand open up those tax loopholes?

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:40.260
James Cameron is incredibly committed to the bit because he also put out that Titanic,

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:42.100
the hunt for the Titanic film.

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:42.600
Yeah.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.460
He is interested in the water.

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:46.340
Yeah, well, of course.

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:49.380
So stupid.

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:49.860
Okay.

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:55.700
So this is the detachment from reality and this stupid shit that Alex puts out.

01:10:55.700 --> 01:11:03.380
And it's mixed up with this religious verve that gets people to think that he's bringing

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:06.420
them to some kind of a real spirituality, but it's not.

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:14.100
Go to band.video, see the ancient Middle Ages, 800 year old carving of the devil, eating

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:14.820
a child.

01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:17.940
And now what do you see at the Space Needle?

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.100
Now, what do you see at the Olympics?

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:22.020
Now, what do you see for real?

01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:24.900
Now, what do you see coming with the mRNA vaccine?

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:30.420
Death, sacrifice of your genetics, sacrifice of your fertility, sacrifice of your health.

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:41.220
The very takeover of your body in a giant genetic ritual with what they cooked up with

01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:47.940
full clone genomes of jellyfish and humans injected, taking over every cell in your body

01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:48.740
cell by cell.

01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:52.340
And by the time you figure out you've been hit by it, you don't know what hit you.

01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:55.780
All right, Brian, Michael, John, everybody, we're going to your calls.

01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:56.740
We come back.

01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:00.420
Then it sticks after Stone's on for a couple of segments and I'll go back to your calls.

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:02.180
Then Robert Barnes is coming up.

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:02.980
This is not a game.

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.700
Fight back with what God gave us.

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.620
Vitamin D3, winter sun in stock.

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:10.660
It's just ridiculous.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:15.220
If you listen to that minute, it's just nonsensical.

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:18.020
Alex, I just want to thank you for bringing me to Christ.

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:24.980
After you told me there was an 800 year old statue of the devil eating a child, and then

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:30.340
I looked at what was happening at the Space Needle and at the Olympics.

01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:31.860
And why not?

01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:32.740
Denver's airport.

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:33.240
Sure.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:34.420
Lucifer.

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:36.180
I came to Christ.

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:39.860
And by that, I mean I bought winter sun because it's on sale.

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:41.380
Yeah, that was what I meant to say.

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.220
The religion of Alex's dumb pills.

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:43.700
Jesus.

01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:45.620
Anyway, Roger Stone is on.

01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:46.260
Oh yeah?

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:46.660
Yeah.

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:51.300
Is he talking about James Cameron's movie after the Avatar sequel where North Korean

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:57.300
get on a boat and they dramatic fly over to Maine?

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:57.620
Nope.

01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:58.660
Drop the ballots off.

01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.420
He just wants to wish Alex a happy new year.

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:01.300
Starring Tom Hanks.

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:04.740
Well, Alex, first of all, happy new year.

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:09.700
It's got to be a better year than 2020, although 2020 certainly had its highlights.

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:15.940
It was not only the year in which I was convicted, framed really in a Soviet style show trial.

01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:16.420
I hate you.

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:20.900
But also the year in which through the mercy of God, the president gave me first a

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:24.420
commutation, then a full and unconditional pardon.

01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:24.660
I hate you.

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:27.380
So here's really what I take offense at.

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:30.900
Roger should be furious at Trump for pardoning him.

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.780
No, no, no, no, no.

01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:37.060
It's because now he doesn't have to spend all that money proving that he was innocent

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:37.940
of the entire thing.

01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:38.340
See?

01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:40.260
He's saving all of his money and he's...

01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:40.580
Nope.

01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:41.700
No, it's a good thing.

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.380
It's a good thing that he doesn't have to...

01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:44.740
Now, obviously he is.

01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:47.300
And he's going to give back all the money that people donated.

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.100
Shut up.

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:48.820
Oh, he's not?

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:54.980
Based on the premise from around the time of that conversation about a commutation,

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:59.460
Roger was explicit that he didn't want a pardon because he had so much evidence that he could

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:03.140
prove that he was set up and he was going to be the one who's going to be the champion

01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:07.940
fighting to expose the deep state corruption that only he could because he had the standing,

01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:09.940
because he had all the evidence that he was innocent.

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:11.620
It was all going to come out in court.

01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:13.140
Trump, don't pardon me.

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:17.700
I'm just afraid to go to prison because there's a lot of COVID-19 in those prisons and I'm

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:22.740
an old man, I have pre-existing health conditions, you need to commute my sentence so I can survive

01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:23.780
to appeal.

01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:24.340
Of course.

01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:27.620
And now, of course, like, hey, isn't it great to pardon me?

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:28.420
Fuck you, man.

01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:28.660
No kidding.

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:29.220
Fuck you.

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:31.460
The whole story is gone now.

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.780
I think if I were the judge...

01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:34.980
You're so full of shit.

01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:42.020
If I were the judge that gave Roger Stone so many fucking chances, and then I heard

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:46.420
that, I would think that every decision that I had ever made up to that point was a bad

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:46.660
one.

01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:51.220
Now listen to me, if I were somebody who listened to Infowars and believed this shit, I would

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.020
be mad about this.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:52.580
You should be.

01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:53.300
I would be mad.

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:57.780
I'd be like, hey, Roger, remember when you were going to be the one who was going to

01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:01.220
get Peter Strzok thrown in prison or whatever?

01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:02.900
Nobody wants to be the first...

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:05.060
Look, I'm not an Infowarrior.

01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:07.620
I'm not the tip of the spear, Dan.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.700
I think he said he's the tip of the spear.

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:12.820
Well, okay, so I said I was the tip of the spear, but I don't want to fight anybody.

01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:17.620
He was begging for money from everybody for his legal defense so he could be there and

01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:19.140
expose the deep state.

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:23.700
If I believed that the deep state was something real that was an imminent threat and was going

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:29.460
to kill my family, I'd probably be pretty fucking pissed off that Roger accepted a pardon

01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:33.940
or even like, I don't know, is there some kind of a mechanic for rejecting a pardon?

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:36.180
Like if you think you're actually innocent?

01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:37.220
Yeah, I believe there is.

01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:38.500
I believe you can reject a pardon.

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:39.220
Guess what?

01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:43.380
He wouldn't need to because he could just tell Trump, don't pardon me, he could actually

01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:45.540
do that instead of just doing that publicly.

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.540
Oh God, I would be so mad at him.

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:50.660
I can't believe these people let these people get away with this.

01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:51.140
I can.

01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:53.380
Well, yeah, I guess I can too, but it's still infuriating.

01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:56.340
That you can get away with this shit is bonkers.

01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:56.900
Yeah.

01:15:56.900 --> 01:16:02.340
And that you, and that it seems almost not, it's almost expected that she'll get away

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:02.980
with it.

01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:08.740
I swear to God, if they were, if they should be smirking all the time at how, Harrison

01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:13.460
Ford should play the parts of everyone at Info Wars with that dumb smirk on his face every

01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:16.420
time he says anything, because if you listen to this, you're fucking stupid.

01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:18.340
Harrison Ford as Harrison Smith.

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.220
Get off my plane.

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:25.540
So Alex is going to DC, you know, he's going to go do this rally.

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:25.780
Sure.

01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:28.820
And like, I was listening to this clip and all I could think is like, this is just a

01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:30.740
separate reality that's being discussed.

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:38.180
We're going to DC like they did in Romania or, you know, like they've done in many other

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:44.820
places and showing our numbers to the dictatorship of the left of the bureaucracy that's trying

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:48.180
to steal the election from our president and complete their takeover.

01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:52.100
We do not want violence of any type because we have the election on our side.

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:52.980
We have the truth.

01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:54.420
It's the left that's violent.

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:59.860
So, I mean, it's just the conception of what's going on is just completely warped.

01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:00.340
Yeah.

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:03.220
There's just, I don't even know how to have a conversation with that.

01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:09.220
This is another one of those things where you're like, I just can't believe that this

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:15.540
is still, it's like those conversations, it's like those debates that we've talked about

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:19.700
where it's like, you're just having the same conversation they had 2000 years ago, but

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:20.100
dumber.

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:20.340
Yeah.

01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:25.540
You don't realize the thoughts that the people who had this conversation a while back had

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:29.460
afterwards through the scholarly discussion about this.

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:36.980
And in the same way, this like, we've literally seen not just this exact thing happen before,

01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:40.100
but this exact thing happened a couple weeks ago.

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:44.900
It's not like this is in the long distant past where there's no way we could possibly

01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:46.020
learn from our history.

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:46.420
Yeah.

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:47.860
This is a couple weeks ago.

01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:49.220
And it's only worse.

01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:50.020
It's only worse.

01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:53.700
Yeah, it's, I just don't know.

01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:58.900
I can't even fathom how fucking stupid this is.

01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:01.060
It's the left that's violent propaganda.

01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:02.980
That's infinite years old.

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:06.180
It's always the same shit and people still fall for it.

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:12.340
Well, I mean, look, the truth is that Alex is going to do this rally and people have

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:16.420
told him that if he doesn't, then maybe he'd get back on Facebook.

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:19.780
I have had ABC national news host call me up.

01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:21.940
I've had others from Fox call me.

01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:25.300
I've had Democrat party lawyers call me and go, Alex, we like you.

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:29.780
You platform, please don't do this in DC.

01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:30.660
You're going to be in danger.

01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:32.180
Somebody might shoot you.

01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:34.660
Oh, please don't lead a violent revolution.

01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:37.380
And really what they're doing is calling up and threatening me.

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:40.180
So they're really concerned about the six, Roger.

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.980
I mean, if they've got it in the bag so much, why are they doing this?

01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:43.700
Because they didn't.

01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:51.860
So an ABC news host called Alex Jones on air, on air, on air host, by the way,

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:52.900
threatening him.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:53.460
Yeah.

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:54.580
Don't do this.

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:57.220
We don't want violence to happen to you.

01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:57.460
Yeah.

01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:57.860
Yeah.

01:18:57.860 --> 01:18:59.460
ABC on air host.

01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:01.220
Hey, look, we like you, Alex.

01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:05.060
Alex, I'm a Democrat lawyer, which is how I've always introduced myself

01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:06.500
on any phone conversation.

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:08.500
And I just want to let you know, we love you.

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.660
Alex, I should tell you I'm a high ranking globalist.

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.140
And I will get you back on Twitter.

01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:15.860
If you just please don't have your violence rally.

01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:16.980
Don't hold this rally.

01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:21.060
We've only seen two of these in the past few weeks and nothing happened then either.

01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:22.580
Well, some things happened.

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:23.300
Well, that's fair.

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:26.740
Not maybe not to the scale Alex was looking for.

01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:29.300
And also, let's not get it twisted.

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:32.180
Alex is going to show up somewhere.

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.500
It's not like Alex is leading a revolution.

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:35.220
No, no, no, no, no.

01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:37.540
But he is one of the bad boys.

01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:44.420
Got a hold of me.

01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:46.340
Yeah, we got two of the real bad boys here.

01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:49.140
You're surely Alex Jones and Roger Stone.

01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:52.740
Fuck yeah, two of the real bad boys.

01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:53.860
Oh boy.

01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:55.380
Oh boy.

01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:56.180
Bad boys.

01:19:59.060 --> 01:19:59.460
Okay.

01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:01.220
Okay.

01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:01.940
All right.

01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:02.340
All right.

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:06.420
If we who's who's Will Smith and who's Martin Lawrence in this?

01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:07.140
I'm not sure.

01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:11.860
But look, I will say that Roger lives up to his reputation as a bad, bad boy.

01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:17.860
You know, Alex, I'm putting in sometimes 17, 18 hour days.

01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:22.660
I'm trying to finish my book, which is entitled Roger Stone did nothing wrong.

01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:26.340
My political persecution and the heist of the 2020 election.

01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:29.460
They are very intricately connected.

01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:30.100
Real quick.

01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:31.460
That's an unwieldy title.

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:32.580
I would shorten that up.

01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:33.220
No, no, no.

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:35.860
I like to go back to 17th century titles.

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:39.460
I like on the existence of this and over that.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:42.820
And on the course of things that might be and over, okay.

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:44.420
No, unwieldy.

01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:45.060
Love it.

01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.620
I'm trying to finish the script for a documentary.

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:48.740
I'm going to be honest with you.

01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:54.180
If I was not using Brain Force Plus, there's no way.

01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:55.700
This is a great product.

01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:58.660
I'm paid nothing to tell you this, folks.

01:20:58.660 --> 01:20:59.460
Bad boys.

01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:02.020
How much is he getting paid to say that?

01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:08.100
I might have suspected that he wasn't getting paid until he said, I'm definitely not getting

01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:13.620
paid for this kind of makes me think you're getting paid dicey.

01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:16.660
Yeah, that's what the bad boys do.

01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:23.060
They work 17 hour days on shelf-serving documentaries and books and then shill for Alex's products.

01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.100
Couple of the bad boys.

01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:26.420
Couple of the real rebels out there.

01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:33.700
And much like bad boys, Roger says, I would say that one of the defining characteristics

01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:38.180
of bad boys is that they defer to authority.

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.940
That's exactly what they do.

01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:41.220
In any situation.

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:41.860
Oh, totally.

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:44.660
I'm not second guessing the president of the United States.

01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:46.580
I don't know what he has up his sleeve.

01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:47.860
I do know this.

01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:51.140
Whatever it is, I will support him 1000%.

01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:54.820
He is the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:56.980
Hey, you're talking to a guy who hates Abraham Lincoln right now.

01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:58.580
I was going to say, this is the guy.

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:01.700
Abraham Lincoln killed Alex's ancestors.

01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:02.740
Well, they fought at least.

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:03.060
Yeah.

01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:05.140
Yeah.

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:09.220
So, I mean, Lincoln might not be the best example to use here.

01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:14.580
I know that for sane people, that might be a good example as a president that's looked

01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:18.340
upon positively, but Alex doesn't like him.

01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:19.940
You're talking to the people who still...

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:21.380
Alex's Confederate Royalty.

01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:24.420
Still smarten over that whole loss back then.

01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:24.580
Yeah.

01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:28.020
Also, just such a bad boy.

01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:30.020
Whatever Trump does, I am fine with.

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:35.620
I will never, never be insubordinate, even if he does the things that I say he shouldn't

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:36.340
do.

01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:42.580
Cause he got me out of prison for something that I definitely would have lost appeal about,

01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:44.740
but I pretend to... fuck it, asshole.

01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:45.220
Jesus.

01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:46.820
I mean, go fuck yourself, Roger.

01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:47.380
Really?

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:48.740
Like really hard.

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:48.980
Yeah.

01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:50.260
Like really hard.

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:51.860
Now it's time for Barnes to come in.

01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:55.540
I like how it never gets better.

01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:56.020
No.

01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:56.340
No.

01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:57.140
No, it doesn't.

01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:59.060
Although this episode will end quite well.

01:22:59.060 --> 01:22:59.620
Okay, good.

01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:05.140
But before that, we got to get through the Meyer that is Robert Barnes.

01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:10.660
So Barnes has a plan, or he's a constitutional lawyer, so he can explain...

01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:15.140
I don't know if any of that's true, but I haven't seen any evidence that would suggest

01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:17.060
he's a constitutional lawyer, but you can continue.

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:18.660
He was Wesley Snipes' lawyer!

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:25.140
So Barnes, because he knows the Constitution, is gonna lay out for Alex the steps that could

01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:28.500
happen in order for Trump to get into office.

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:35.220
And basically, it's just an elaborately, absurdly complicated plan that is not gonna happen.

01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:40.180
So all of those are basically in play, and the question is, what do House members and

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:45.540
Senators do when presented with argument and evidence about these individual states' electors?

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:50.420
Do they uphold an unconstitutional election, or do they contest that unconstitutional election?

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:57.780
If Biden ends up with fewer than 270 electoral votes at the end of this process,

01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:02.740
then under the 12th Amendment, the election goes to the House of Representatives to vote

01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:04.420
by state delegation.

01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:07.220
Not by individual members, but by state delegation.

01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:09.540
So, and that heavily favors Trump.

01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:14.260
So the big question, the first big question was, would a Senator join the objections?

01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:17.300
We now know, Senator Hawley, that will happen.

01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:21.780
That means these votes have to take place, that means these hearings have to take place,

01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:26.900
and that gives the President, while a long shot, a shot to have a constitutionally correct

01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:30.180
response take place to this unconstitutional election.

01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:34.180
What can we the people do to put pressure?

01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:35.780
Obviously, March, what else?

01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:36.820
Chew your food?

01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:39.940
Yeah, I would say talk with your mouth empty would be-

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:42.020
Eat during the breaks, asshole.

01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:42.980
Yeah, cheers.

01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:46.020
You've got a constitutional lawyer trying to tell you how the Constitution works and

01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:47.860
Trump could steal this election.

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:50.260
Don't eat a sandwich while he's telling me this.

01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:55.700
This is all just this elaborate, this root.

01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:57.540
So you've got the objections.

01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:03.860
Let's say Arizona is being objected to, and then somehow magically that objection

01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:08.260
stands and everyone agrees on it, then those electoral votes are taken away, and then you

01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:11.940
get Biden under the threshold, and then now the House elects-

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:12.260
Right.

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:19.780
Oh God, it sounds like QAnon stuff, but you should know that even though Alex has not

01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:24.660
gotten the memo about Lin Wood, Robert Barnes has, and he does not like what he's hearing.

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:28.580
Well, I think Lin Wood is doing a lot of damage to the President's case,

01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:34.180
particularly in Congress where he needs votes, he needs votes out of House members and Senators.

01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:39.140
And I think the reason why the media has been happy to let him go wild and why Twitter hasn't

01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:44.260
censored him at all is because they see them as helping Democrats and hurting Trump.

01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:49.700
I think he thinks he's helping Trump, but in fact he's not because he's pursuing allegations

01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:54.500
that either cannot be proven at this stage or within this timeframe, or allegations that

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:57.540
distract from the core issues that can be proven.

01:25:57.540 --> 01:25:58.980
Which are-

01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:03.300
And frankly, Wood has been involved with a lot of the QAnon types who believe a lot of

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:08.340
stuff that just has not been proven true. And that's a key problem, and unfortunately Sidney

01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:10.260
Powell got entrapped by a lot of that.

01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:15.540
Entrapped by a lot of that? What does that mean? Unpack that word, counselor.

01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:25.380
I would say that my new exhortation for everyone is to always be carrying tomatoes with you

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.860
in case you see Robert Barnes.

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:32.900
I'm amazed by the turn of phrase that Sidney Powell was entrapped by QAnon stuff.

01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:34.580
Entrapped by QAnon stuff.

01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:36.820
Is that a legally meaningful term?

01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:42.340
I don't know, did she get to catch a predator with QAnon stuff?

01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:44.660
I don't want to say that she believes dumb shit.

01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:45.860
Hey, why don't you have a seat?

01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:50.500
So anyway, Barnes lays out this scenario again for Alex.

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:56.820
Yes, so if I understand correctly, it's possible that a Rube Goldberg machine might have been

01:26:56.820 --> 01:27:05.140
activated by a lawsuit that will then suddenly roll down one of those ducts that bends over

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:09.300
and drinks water and pops back up, and then there'll be an overthrow of the government,

01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:10.420
and we're all just going to be fine.

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:12.740
They're playing Constitution mousetrap.

01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:13.240
Gotcha.

01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:17.540
I want to find that for people that aren't Constitution lawyers, how that would happen

01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:21.700
if the House and Senate voted to do that, what the states would then do, what that would

01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:22.200
look like.

01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:30.020
So what would happen is if Joe Biden does not reach 270 electoral votes that are uncontested

01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:36.020
and that have not yet been certified, then the remedy under the 12th Amendment is to

01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:36.900
go to the House.

01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:40.660
Now, the Vice President Pence, there is an interpretation of the 12th Amendment that

01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:46.100
Vice President Pence can do this all by himself, that he can say there's contests involving

01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:48.340
too many states, so there's not enough.

01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:50.980
Neither candidate has more than 270 electoral votes.

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:55.300
So under the 12th Amendment, the House must vote now by state delegation.

01:27:55.300 --> 01:28:00.660
So all the and in some houses you have a tie, so the vote probably wouldn't count.

01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:05.700
But it's the it's the newly seeded house, not the old house, but the newly seeded house

01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:06.740
that would vote.

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:11.460
They would vote by state and whoever gets 26 states to vote for them wins.

01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:16.180
Or if it's 25 and 23 and two are tied, they win.

01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:20.020
So the the president has an edge with 27 states.

01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:20.820
Wow.

01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:24.980
And this makes the Georgia election also more important than ever.

01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:28.740
Yes, that's why that's why Trump has been pursuing it.

01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:34.260
He knows he needs those Republican senators to have a chance to get to the House delegation

01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:35.620
in the first place.

01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:38.580
To get to this stupid Hail Mary nonsense that you're talking about.

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:42.580
Oh, this is why I like that election is is important to Trump.

01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:44.500
Oh, yeah, it makes sense.

01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:46.260
This is nonsense.

01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:53.700
Like like here's here's why this stuff exists is because this makes sense when it's only

01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:55.540
white landowners who are allowed to vote.

01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:59.300
So you can have all these conversations in Congress because you're like, this is also

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:02.260
the total number of people who were allowed to vote in this election.

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:04.340
But when but when everybody's allowed to vote.

01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:07.780
OK, sooner or later.

01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:09.460
Yeah, this is going to have to happen.

01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:15.860
One side is going to have to accept what they believe is an undemocratic election.

01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:17.060
Oh, either way.

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:18.980
But we already did in 2000.

01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:20.020
Exactly.

01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:22.180
So that's how it's going to go down.

01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:28.580
Either either the Democrats admit, fine, you can stay in office because you imagine something

01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:30.340
happened and we're just going to live with it.

01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:35.220
Or Republicans are going to have to be like, fine, we're just fine with an undemocratically

01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:39.620
chosen president because at no point in time are these people going to ever believe that

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:40.740
they that he's the.

01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:44.580
Well, they have to they have to accept what they perceive to be.

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:45.220
That's what I'm saying.

01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:46.660
Not an actually undemocratic.

01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:47.300
Exactly.

01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:47.780
Exactly.

01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:50.020
But in their minds, it's just as real as anything else.

01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:50.820
Yeah, that's fair.

01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:54.660
So I mean, I don't know, there's no there's no other way to like.

01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:56.660
There's some humble pie that will need to be eaten.

01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:57.160
Yeah.

01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:02.260
By Trump fans because otherwise it gets bad.

01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:07.460
By our blown up knees like that'll that'll be one way for us to eat humble pie.

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:09.700
Well, see, here's the thing.

01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:15.220
Barnes has got this elaborate scenario wherein maybe there's an interpretation of the 12th

01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:19.060
Amendment where Pence can just be like, hey, shit doesn't look good.

01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:20.980
Let's do steal it.

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:24.420
Yeah, I think that was Sideshow Bob's interpretation of the 12th Amendment.

01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:28.500
Alex is a little bit worried about that, though, because why?

01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.740
Well, seems kind of dictator ish.

01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:34.820
Well, Alex would like to avoid the perception of being a dictator.

01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:36.020
Sure.

01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:40.180
Is there not another way so they don't claim Trump overturned the election as a dictator

01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:43.300
for the ignorant people out there to say we're going to have a new election?

01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:46.740
Because even the U.N., the State Department say if there's not poll watchers, if there's

01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:48.500
big questions, you should redo.

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:49.860
That's the international standard.

01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:51.300
That's the American standard.

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:53.940
We don't normally have to redo elections, but I think this is the time to do it.

01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:54.980
Is there a path to do that?

01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:57.380
Congress could do that.

01:30:57.380 --> 01:31:01.380
Congress could set another election day and say that given the contested presidential

01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:04.580
election, we're going to have election day on January 19th.

01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:09.380
For example, I think they're too cowardly when the Democrats have done this gaslighting

01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:10.980
saying they want to run this scam.

01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:12.820
I think they're just too cowardly.

01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:16.580
These people in Congress should absolutely overturn the fraud, which they should.

01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:19.300
But I think the third way is a new election.

01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:20.420
I think Trump's leaning towards that.

01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:20.980
I've been told.

01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:21.700
Have you talked to him?

01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:27.300
He was always open to that, but he preferred his original remedy, of course, was

01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:30.740
preferred that he be declared the winner based on an honest vote count.

01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:32.100
Yeah, that makes sense.

01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:32.660
Wild.

01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:33.140
Yeah.

01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:33.700
Wild.

01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:37.220
It's it's like looking into a funhouse mirror.

01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:38.580
It really is nuts.

01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:44.100
I would give anything for a Democratic Party as strong and as conniving is what they

01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:44.980
imagine.

01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:52.740
I would take any single activist under the age of 20 over anybody in Congress right

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:52.980
now.

01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:55.220
That's the reality of it.

01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:56.500
They're pathetic.

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:57.700
It's sad.

01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:00.260
It's but it's sad.

01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:05.700
Even so, like, I mean, like, we could talk about that all day.

01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:10.340
I'm I'm I'm much more interested in how this is being painted.

01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:10.980
Yeah.

01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:16.020
They're talking about like, hey, you know, like the sensible middle ground is another

01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:16.500
election.

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:16.900
Yeah.

01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:20.980
Like, hey, look, we can just do another election as a favor to the Democrats.

01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:22.660
We could do another election.

01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:24.180
Like, what the fuck?

01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:25.540
How many how many?

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:26.980
How detached is this?

01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:27.940
I don't know.

01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:28.580
I don't know.

01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:32.740
I don't know how you could even take it seriously as a OK, you want another election?

01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:36.980
What will need to happen for you to agree that Biden lost?

01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:37.540
Just tell me.

01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:38.100
Oh, yeah.

01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:39.300
What are the parameters?

01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:44.420
In fact, yeah, I would be for another election if you had to write down exactly what you

01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:46.180
need to accept the election.

01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:49.700
And then if it happens, you have to shut the fuck up forever.

01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:50.740
Sorry, I can't do that.

01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:52.900
I wrote those down when I was in a fugue state.

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:54.740
See, now this is what I'm talking about.

01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:58.900
Also, Robert Barnes is on Stefan Molyneux's show within the last year.

01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:01.060
Hey, white nationalist buddy.

01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:05.620
So anyway, Barnes thinks that the problem for Trump is that he has a lack of allies

01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:07.220
and that they've all betrayed him.

01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:08.740
I wonder why they would do that.

01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:14.020
Oh, well, the fundamental weakness the president has had throughout his four year tenure has

01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:17.620
been the lack of allies in key positions of power around him.

01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:23.300
And he's coming to terms with the full recognition of what that means as he sees McConnell's

01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:27.940
recommended judges betray him at every single level, as he sees McConnell tries to betray

01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:33.060
him in the Senate on the upcoming vote, as he sees what's happened with the Republican

01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:35.940
governors in Arizona and Georgia undermining him.

01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:37.940
So he now fully appreciates it.

01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:41.700
But I think he undervalued it before and he had too few allies.

01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:46.180
And the effect of it is smart allies would have him periscoping every single day, would

01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:51.140
have him doing, you know, introducing Trump TV now and doing at least one hour updates

01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:56.100
every single night, answering questions, connecting to people directly, getting people proactive

01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:59.140
had he controlled the narrative in that manner.

01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:03.860
Then some of this Linsanity from Linwood and some of these other Q movements could not

01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:06.500
have diverted people's attention.

01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:10.260
And Big Tech wouldn't have seen a green light to even start censoring him.

01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:13.940
I don't know if it's a good idea or not, but I will tell you, I don't want to live in a

01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:17.940
world where the president is moonlighting as a TRL host.

01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:18.500
Not good.

01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:19.700
Taking calls.

01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:23.380
I mean, in the reality we live in, I think it might be a smart idea.

01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:24.340
I don't want to live there.

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:26.420
We're talking about two different things.

01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:27.860
You're talking about effective.

01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:28.260
Yes.

01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:28.820
Yeah.

01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:31.540
I'm talking about that would be dark.

01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:34.420
I'm more mad at him taking Linsanity away.

01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:40.740
That is one of the five good things that have happened to the Knicks in the past hundred

01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:41.300
years.

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:41.940
Shame on you, Barnes.

01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:43.060
How dare you?

01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:45.300
The Knicks have had five good moments.

01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:45.540
Okay.

01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:51.540
Yeah, so I guess they want Trump to have a media outlet that he's operating while he

01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:58.500
is in power and should have been doing it while he was trying to be reelected, which

01:34:58.500 --> 01:34:59.700
is fucked up.

01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:04.100
You know what's not dystopian at all is if it was forced into our homes no matter what

01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:07.940
we did and it was always on screen and you couldn't even turn the TV off if you wanted

01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:08.100
to.

01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:10.100
Alex's buddy suggested that on the other day.

01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:10.580
Oh, really?

01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:12.660
The emergency alert system.

01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:16.500
Now that reminds me of this one thing from that book that they like to talk about all

01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:17.380
that all the time.

01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:18.180
What was it called?

01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:25.540
Because in that book, the Dictator's Dystopia, he was always on that.

01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:26.420
Wind in the Willows.

01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:26.900
That was it.

01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:29.140
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:35.060
Yeah, so you may recall the last time Alex went to DC, he spoke at that Jericho March

01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:37.860
and in the course of the day, he ran into Mike Flynn.

01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:42.660
And unfortunately, video came out of this where Mike Flynn looked at Alex like he was

01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:46.180
a weirdo and then ran away.

01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:47.220
We have an update on that.

01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:47.620
What?

01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:49.460
Turns out Mike Flynn called to apologize.

01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:51.300
That's what this is all about.

01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:55.540
But I told the story of how this happened and I just handed it off immediately because

01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:58.580
no one else was stepping up and there wasn't a magical Q group.

01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:01.140
There wasn't a magical Intel group doing it.

01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:06.100
And I had General Flynn called me yesterday and said, I'm sorry about how it looked like

01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:08.020
when I got startled by you that I'm not a friend.

01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:09.140
And they said, I'm sorry that happened.

01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:10.260
I said, I totally understand.

01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.380
He's going to be there.

01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:12.900
So everybody's together.

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:13.700
Everybody's good.

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:15.220
Everything's great.

01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:21.140
Look, I'm sorry that I was startled by you and I looked like I wasn't a friend.

01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:23.540
Normally, normally I don't particularly care.

01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:28.820
Anytime they do those, like when reached for comment, this person said, this is the only

01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:33.620
time I want Michael Flynn on record as having said yes or no to this being true.

01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:36.500
Also, was Mike Flynn entrapped by the keystone?

01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:40.820
Where are we going to draw the line on entrapment?

01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:44.980
If there's entrapment, are they being blackmailed by pedophiles?

01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:45.860
What is happening?

01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:46.420
I don't know.

01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:47.140
Jesus.

01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:51.460
Anyway, I'd like to remind you before I play this clip that Robert Barnes is a constitutional

01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:51.780
lawyer.

01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:52.260
Are you sure?

01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:54.900
We'll talk about what Trump's role should be if they effectively steal it.

01:36:54.900 --> 01:37:00.580
He's got to never concede and just be the president in absentia, in exile, and just

01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:01.780
keep building the movement against him.

01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:02.260
Do you remember that?

01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:03.460
Like the constitution says.

01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:04.660
Oh, no doubt about it.

01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:06.180
And it needs to be at the...

01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:07.860
There's been too much focus at the top.

01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:09.460
Hugh always focuses on the top.

01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:10.020
We need to focus...

01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:12.580
This needs to be a bottom-up revolution if it's going to work.

01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:15.060
You're complaining that other people are focusing too much at the top.

01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:18.100
You're saying you should have a make-believe second president.

01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:20.500
That seems like a pretty harsh focus on the top.

01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:27.140
Are we just going to exile him to an island for a while until he eventually returns to

01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:29.700
recapture the empire and then...

01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:30.820
I like islands too much.

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:33.940
Send him to Atlantis.

01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:34.420
All right.

01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:36.420
That's where Bonaparte is.

01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:39.380
I promised you that we were going to end this episode on a fun note.

01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:39.620
Yes.

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:40.420
And we will.

01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:41.140
Okay.

01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:44.580
Because there is a call that comes in that is huge.

01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:44.900
Okay.

01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:47.300
Let's talk to John in Wyoming.

01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:48.100
John, thanks for holding.

01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:48.420
Go ahead.

01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:50.340
Good morning, Alex.

01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:50.660
Yes!

01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:53.460
It's Old Man House Phone!

01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:54.100
He's alive!

01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:56.100
Old Man House Phone, you live!

01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:56.900
Sign of life.

01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.260
January 1st, 2021.

01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:04.420
Of course he joins us on the first day of the new year.

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:09.380
He's like, I don't know, a groundhog showing up and seeing its shadow so there's no more

01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:09.860
winter or something.

01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:11.460
Old Man House Phone returns.

01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:13.060
Old Man House Phone's alive.

01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:14.500
Hey, Old Man House Phone.

01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:17.540
But he probably is, because he lives in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming and that's a

01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:18.020
house phone.

01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:19.700
So he's not a high COVID risk.

01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:20.420
No, no, no.

01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:20.980
That would be a...

01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:22.740
Although he is really old, from what I recall.

01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:25.060
I'll tell you this, he's at least an hour outside of town.

01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:26.340
Yeah, he listens to Skousen.

01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:32.340
So anyway, his call is not very interesting at all, but it is worth celebrating that he

01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:33.140
is alive.

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:34.100
It's good to see him back.

01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:35.700
Yeah, and here's how the call ends.

01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:39.220
And John, you've been calling in for like 15, 16, maybe.

01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:40.340
How long you been calling in, John?

01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:41.380
You haven't gotten on in years.

01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:45.780
Oh, it's, you know, since little Orphan Annie had pupils in her eyes.

01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:47.220
All right, brother.

01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:49.780
I said I'm gonna start that show years ago with our best callers.

01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:52.580
I never did it, but we finally have started doing it.

01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:53.540
Give me your name and number again.

01:38:53.540 --> 01:38:54.660
I want to have you on as a guest.

01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:57.060
I'll get you on with Harrison on the American Journal.

01:38:57.060 --> 01:39:04.820
You have been giving him your name and number for over 17 years since fucking...

01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:09.780
I was in college when he first gave the phone number.

01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:12.660
Old man house phone.

01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:14.900
Yeah, we're gonna do it over Skype.

01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:16.820
Do you want to do it over Skype, old man house phone?

01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:20.100
What's that?

01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:25.860
I don't think I can do FaceTime on my rotary.

01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:26.260
Hold on.

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:29.620
I'm gonna have to plug into the other operator and see if she can handle that out.

01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:33.460
Sorry, I can't come on your show today.

01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:34.820
It's a party line.

01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:36.900
Could you please hang up?

01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:38.100
I need to keep this line open.

01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:41.220
Wow.

01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:42.020
Oh, man.

01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:42.420
Wow.

01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:45.940
See, now the problem is everybody should have a good house phone

01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:49.060
just in case they need to hang up on Alex Jones.

01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:49.380
Sure.

01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:50.500
Because if you could hang up on...

01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:52.420
Oh, you could make a real good noise out of it.

01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:53.060
It'd be great.

01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:57.220
Yeah, I do think that people who are of a certain age, younger folks,

01:39:57.220 --> 01:39:59.060
probably don't know that experience.

01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:02.420
The joy of really slamming a phone down.

01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:02.980
Yeah, it's pretty cathartic.

01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:08.500
Just like solving a lot of problems that you didn't even know you had with one phone slam.

01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:10.180
Yeah, I don't miss it though.

01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:12.900
Maybe I was a more angsty person whenever.

01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:14.260
Stationary phones go around.

01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:14.740
Sure, sure.

01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:17.140
Wall phones, jamming the fucking...

01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:20.180
Oh, man, have you ever broken one of the things on a wall phone?

01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:20.900
I think everybody has.

01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:21.940
Oh, yeah, it's the best.

01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:22.340
Yeah.

01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:23.220
The worst is when...

01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:23.700
Sorry, Dan.

01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:28.980
The worst is when you try to sort of slam a wall phone horizontally and it doesn't stick.

01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:31.060
It just drops.

01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:32.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:34.180
That gesture did not work.

01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:37.940
That's like tripping up the stairs whenever two people can see you.

01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:41.940
And there's no escape from that moment of embarrassment where you're like, shit.

01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:42.340
Yeah.

01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:43.140
Yep.

01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:49.300
So we begin 2021 and I think that there's an old man house phone showing up and giving

01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:52.500
us proof of life is probably a great sign.

01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:53.460
I think it's a good omen.

01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:53.860
Yeah.

01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:59.540
I think it says 2021 is going to be more house phone oriented.

01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:01.300
Maybe.

01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:01.940
I don't know.

01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:05.300
I don't know what it portends, but it's something positive.

01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:08.260
A step backward in technological development.

01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:11.620
COVID Sharia.

01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:14.980
My COVID.

01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:15.300
Sorry.

01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:16.500
I forget.

01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:18.260
I just wanted to play that.

01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:19.700
I forgot to play it at the beginning.

01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:20.020
Sorry.

01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:24.900
That sorry is always...

01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:25.220
Sorry.

01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:27.940
I mean, it's the right thing to say.

01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:29.300
It is the right thing to say.

01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:29.860
It's just weird.

01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:30.420
I want to know.

01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:31.220
That's the other thing.

01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:32.420
Two questions for once.

01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:34.740
The plexiglass between us.

01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:35.140
Sure.

01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:36.180
Atlantis.

01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:37.620
And why do you say sorry?

01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:39.780
What is motivating that?

01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:40.820
Are you actually sorry?

01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:42.260
I bet that's a childhood tick.

01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:42.820
It must be.

01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:43.060
Yeah.

01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:45.540
I think that's a Texas childhood tick for him.

01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:46.100
It's got to be.

01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:46.580
Yeah.

01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:48.580
So, Jordan, we'll be back.

01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:50.020
But until then, we have a website.

01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:50.740
We do have a website.

01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:51.780
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:51.940
Yep.

01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:53.220
We're also on Twitter.

01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:54.100
We are on Twitter.

01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:55.300
It's at knowledgefight.net.

01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:56.340
Go2betjordan.

01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:56.500
Yep.

01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:57.300
We're also on Facebook.

01:41:57.300 --> 01:41:59.860
We are on Facebook.

01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:02.420
Please find a local charity or bail fund in your area

01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:04.740
to help out people doing God's work right now.

01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:04.900
Yep.

01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:05.380
We'll be back.

01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:06.260
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:06.660
I'm Leo.

01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:07.620
I'm DZXClark.

01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:09.140
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:11.060
I'm thrilled that Old Man House Phone is alive.

01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:12.500
I mean that un-sarcastically.

01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:14.900
It's pretty nice to hear from him again.

01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:17.300
It's almost like hearing that Don DeGrande Prix is alive.

01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:18.900
But unfortunately, I have bad news.

01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:19.540
He is not.

01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:21.060
But Old Man House Phone is.

01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:22.740
Andy in Kansas.

01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:23.220
You're on the air.

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:23.860
Thanks for holding.

01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:26.500
Hello, Alex.

01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:27.460
I'm a first time caller.

01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:28.260
I'm a huge fan.

01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:29.060
I love your work.

01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:37.460
I love you.
