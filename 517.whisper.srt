2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,360
I have great respect for knowledgefight.

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,360
Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,280
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,280
Knowledgefight.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,280

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,280
Riddle her.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,280
Riddle her.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,280
Riddle her.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,280
Riddle her.

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
Need money.

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,280
Riddle her.

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,280
Riddle her.

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,280
Riddle her.

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,280
Andy and Kansas.

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,280
Andy and Kansas.

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,280
Stop it.

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,280
Andy and Kansas.

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,280
Andy and Kansas.

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
Andy and Kansas.

24
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,280
It's time to pray.

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,280
Andy and Kansas.

26
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,280
You're on the air.

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
Thanks for holding.

28
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
Hello Alex.

29
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,280
I'm a first time caller.

30
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
I'm a huge fan.

31
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
I love your room.

I love you.

35
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Hey everybody.

36
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
Welcome back to Knowledgefight.

37
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
I'm Dan.

38
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,400
I'm Jordan.

39
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,400
We're a couple dudes.

40
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,200
We like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

41
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,400
Oh indeed we are Dan.

42
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Jordan.

43
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Dan.

44
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Jordan.

45
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Quick question for you.

46
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
What's up?

47
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
What's your bright spot today?

48
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,960
My bright spot today, Jordan, is a happy anniversary for our show.

49
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
Oh that's right.

50
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
It is our anniversary.

51
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
We are recording this.

52
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
January 7th.

53
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
Yes.

54
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Four years ago.

55
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
It's crazy.

56
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
Our first episode came out.

57
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
What are we doing?

58
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
I don't know.

59
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
How dare we do this for four years?

60
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
I'm mad at us.

61
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
What is it?

62
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
Yeah.

63
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
Yeah.

64
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Shit.

65
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,960
Somehow we are also a cancer on this world.

66
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,840
Oh, dammit.

67
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,320
That was unexpected four years ago, but here we are and it's been a fun ride at times.

68
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,320
Yeah.

69
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,040
And we got quite an appropriate gift from the universe.

70
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,840
Yes, as far as a four year, yeah.

71
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,920
But it is nice to still be working on this with you and I appreciate that and so that

72
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
is my bright spot.

73
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
No, it's beautiful.

74
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,040
It's one of those things where I have a hard time remembering that we didn't do this show.

75
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
At some point.

76
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
Yeah.

77
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
Like there's a part of me that's like remembering-

78
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
I did open mics.

79
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
No, I remember.

80
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
No, no, no.

81
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
I was 24.

82
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,560
I was in the fucking suburbs and I was doing an open mic my third of the night and I keep

83
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
in my memory.

84
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,680
I'm like, well tomorrow I'm going to have to record.

85
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,440
Like that's how ridiculous it is that we do this show.

86
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,840
The schedule has become something you've super imposed on.

87
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
Retroactive.

88
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Yeah, yeah.

89
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
Absolutely.

90
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
What's your bright spot?

91
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,640
My bright spot is I got new glasses.

92
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Nice.

93
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,080
I got new glasses about two weeks after I got these.

94
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,920
My dog Jake got a whole of them and there's tooth marks and the like all over.

95
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,520
And that was about a year ago.

96
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,320
So I went and got a new pair of glasses.

97
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,400
And Dan, do you want to know how stupid I am?

98
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,460
How stupid?

99
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,680
When I went to get new glasses, I was looking at the frames and I was like, oh, you know

100
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
what I'll do?

101
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
I'll get some different frames.

102
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,400
I like the same style, but I'm going to get some different frames.

103
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,560
Can I predict what happened?

104
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,040
I got the same exact frame, exact same frames.

105
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,280
Intending to get the different ones.

106
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,400
Intending to get different frames, I got the same one because I am predictable.

107
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
That's pretty sweet.

108
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
They look good though.

109
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Yeah, they look great.

110
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,560
So something that doesn't look great is our prospects for going to bed at a decent hour.

111
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,480
We're recording this a little bit late because necessity kind of had to.

112
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,440
Yeah, you were, you know, some big news happened yesterday and you decided to sleep the whole

113
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
day.

114
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,920
You didn't pay any attention to it.

115
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,120
You've really, like you did maybe two hours of work on this episode, right?

116
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
Really phoned it in.

117
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,480
Yeah, you threw this one on the, yeah.

118
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,560
We were talking on Tuesday, we recorded our little bonus scavenger hunt over zoom and

119
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,140
after we recorded that we were talking and I'm like, well, tomorrow's going to suck.

120
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,840
It's going to be a disaster.

121
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,720
I'm going to have to work a whole lot, so I'm going to do nothing today.

122
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,120
I'm going to treat myself to a little bit of relaxation because I know that Wednesday

123
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,600
is going to suck.

124
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,040
I didn't think it was going to suck in the way that it did.

125
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,920
Oh, at that point I was kind of predicting a dumb rally, but what I was thinking was

126
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,640
going to suck was that Alex had interviewed Mike Flynn and I didn't want to deal with

127
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
that.

128
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,200
Oh man, how naive I was on Tuesday.

129
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,560
I am the 10th famous person on the plane where the big bopper went down.

130
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,080
Not going to be in the news anymore.

131
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,080
Yeah, Mike Flynn's interview.

132
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,080
You're going to have to be on the back burner.

133
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,400
Yeah, page A-26 my friends.

134
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,760
I did watch it and it's boring, but we may cover it at some point because it is a bizarre

135
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,840
thing to happen because you have Mike Flynn who's like the hero of the QAnon folk who

136
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,200
think Alex Jones is like a CIA massage shill and the two of them are doing an interview

137
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,840
where they're like, Hey buddy, and they won't stop talking about it on the episode that

138
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,400
we're going to be going over today.

139
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,160
It ends with the two of them hugging.

140
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
Oh, great.

141
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,160
I love it.

142
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
Great.

143
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,400
Tom Pappert describes it as like a really important moment.

144
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Yeah.

145
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Yeah.

146
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Yeah.

147
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Of course.

148
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
I don't know how QAnon fans would rationalize that.

149
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,440
Like it seems like it'd be really difficult for their hero to be hugging a CIA facade

150
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,440
agent.

151
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
I know.

152
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
Here's how I would do it.

153
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,520
I would say he actually doesn't know anything about us, doesn't care and would just like

154
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
our money.

155
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,600
Ah, I mean that would be, that would be on the level.

156
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Yeah.

157
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,920
So Jordan, today, what we're going to be doing, we're going to be going over, first of all,

158
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,080
the speeches that Owen Troyer and Alex Jones gave at a Stop the Steal rally on the evening

159
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,400
of January 5th.

160
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Okay.

161
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,040
Then we will be tracking the entire day's coverage on Info Wars on January 6th.

162
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Okay.

163
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,200
We're going to start with the American Journal call-in show.

164
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Call-in show.

165
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
No calls.

166
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,000
No calls.

167
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why not?

168
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,440
Well, I mean, nothing had happened by then.

169
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,160
No, I don't.

170
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,360
That's early in the morning.

171
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,560
It's mostly because Harrison Smith is hosting and he's just basically throwing it to...

172
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Just boring.

173
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,880
Well, he's just throwing it to like Don Jr.'s speech and stuff like that.

174
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

175
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,840
Then we've got the Alex Jones show, comes on after that.

176
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,720
Also hosted by Harrison Smith, because Alex and Owen are in DC.

177
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,860
And then we've got The War Room, which is hosted by Tom Papert and also Alex Jones and

178
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,840
Owen Schroyer in DC.

179
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Okay.

180
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,520
So, if I understand correctly, we are playing the Washington Generals today.

181
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,840
Is that what's going on?

182
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,720
It is the B string.

183
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
But it's still important.

184
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,760
I do still think it's important to look at the lens of how the coverage on Info Wars

185
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:39,120
went because you can see Alex's hand, editorial control, you can see the training that these

186
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,680
people have had under Alex, and Alex does show up a bit, and he's yelling.

187
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
For sure, for sure.

188
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
And it's a load of nonsense.

189
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,920
But I apologize to everybody, I have been working straight through all day yesterday.

190
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,300
I forgot to get names for Wonks.

191
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,640
So I'll tell you what, before we start today's show, I'd like to say thank you to everybody

192
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,100
who supports our show, and also everybody who likes the show but doesn't support it.

193
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
I'd like to thank you.

194
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:12,080
Anybody out there who needs this today, who needs a nice little pick-me-up, you're a policy

195
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Wonk.

196
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
You know that?

197
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
I'm a policy Wonk.

198
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Thank you.

199
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
Thanks, everybody.

200
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Put a smile on your face.

201
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,800
Thanks to all the Wonks, non-Wonks, and I guess people who are hearing this ten years

202
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
in the future.

203
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Sure.

204
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Yeah.

205
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,520
So yeah, on Wednesday, there was the planned rally in DC.

206
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
We knew that there was-

207
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,400
Went off without a hitch.

208
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:38,360
I was not surprised, inasmuch as they've been talking about this for a long time, and Alex

209
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,000
has been trying to incite an event like people storming the White House-

210
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Sure.

211
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,380
Or not the White House, excuse me, the Capitol building, for quite a while.

212
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,600
That has been something that has been a predictable conclusion from some-

213
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Sure.

214
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,000
But I would be lying if I said I wasn't still, like, shocked.

215
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah.

216
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,320
I wasn't ready for it to happen.

217
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Right.

218
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,360
I was, I thought it was, like I said already, I thought it was gonna be another dumb rally

219
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,400
where Ali Alexander says a bunch of nonsense, and then everyone goes home.

220
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,460
I was taken aback by how quickly things got out of control, how extremely they got out

221
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:17,960
of control, and I was pretty surprised watching Alex's coverage of it, too.

222
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,560
Yeah, I'm interested to see.

223
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,040
I was trying to avoid dipping my toe into how the conservative media would react too

224
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,760
much to this, just so I didn't get a whiff of ruining the whole premise of the show,

225
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,680
which is that I don't know what Alex is gonna say.

226
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,680
Yeah.

227
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,480
So I am very curious to see how they all take this as a glaring loss and that they're all

228
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,200
a bunch of embarrassing morons.

229
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,520
I think that's what they're gonna-

230
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,780
I think this is interesting because you and I have very different takes on the events

231
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,780
that transpired.

232
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,960
Yes, very much.

233
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,060
Over our text messages, we've been going back and forth, and there's a little bit of a disagreement,

234
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,720
and I actually think that both of our positions have merit, and there's validity to both of

235
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
them.

236
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,520
You believe that this was an optics disaster, and they all looked like dum-dums, and this

237
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,400
is going to be crippling to the right-wing extremist movement.

238
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,880
Yeah, I would argue that.

239
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,280
And I can see where you're coming from, and I think that there is a place for mocking,

240
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,960
and I think that that is something that is valid to be part of the conversation.

241
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Sure, sure.

242
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,760
Personally, I see Patriot lore being established, and that worries me.

243
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:34,040
I see, you know, the way that Alex talks about Colonel Travis and his time at the Alamo,

244
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,520
and it's like, this isn't history.

245
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
Sure.

246
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
This is Patriot lore.

247
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
Sure, sure, sure.

248
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,120
This is something like a misunderstanding and a misrepresentation of the past.

249
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Yeah.

250
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,780
I see that happening in the present, and I see all of the elements that are necessary

251
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:56,160
in this event to become a part of Patriot lore that is really encouraging and inspiring

252
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,880
and dangerous for people in the future.

253
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Yeah.

254
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,680
And I don't think that you don't think that's valid also.

255
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,880
No, I think that's one of the weird things about our general disagreements is, I think

256
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,600
you're probably right if a certain couple of variables, like, our worldviews are just

257
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,680
like a couple little variables twisted here or there and we disagree.

258
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,620
Otherwise, I think, even then, we're still coming at it from the same, like, this is

259
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,640
where all of these people think.

260
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:31,280
Yeah, and I think that some of these differences in our perspective, I hope they can be more

261
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,160
fleshed out as we go along through the episode as we see the Infowars coverage.

262
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
I think it's interesting.

263
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,280
I think it's very interesting.

264
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,520
Yeah, so we're going to jump in with the speeches at the Stop the Steal rally, but before we

265
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,040
do, here's an out of context drop from today's show.

266
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,760
God and his consciousness creates the ocean that creates the waves on which Donald Trump

267
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,800
or an Alex Jones or you ride in on.

268
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Yep.

269
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,960
So God creates the ocean, the ocean creates the waves, and Donald Trump, Alex Jones, and

270
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,760
you ride them waves.

271
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
Great.

272
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
Okay.

273
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,320
Alex might have been fucked up.

274
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,120
He seems like he's gassed, like he's running out of breath.

275
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,240
It's a mess.

276
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
He's not...

277
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,840
Oh God, it's another instance of him being the guy at the comedy show you never want

278
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
to go after.

279
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

280
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,640
You don't want this guy in the middle of the booking.

281
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
Not where it's supposed to be.

282
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,840
No, because he's going to burn out the audience with just...

283
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
You can't do it.

284
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
No.

285
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,740
I mean, even if the guy in front of you is only doing 10 minutes and you're doing 45,

286
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,440
if he gets eight standing ovations, you're done.

287
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
Yeah.

288
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
You're fucked.

289
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
The end.

290
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Yeah.

291
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
So we start with Owen though.

292
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
Owen opens for Alex.

293
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
He does a good...

294
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,600
He does a tight five, let's say.

295
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,740
But he starts off by ripping off Alex.

296
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,120
President Trump is watching this and he's very excited at what he sees.

297
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:06,080
And he's going to have some big announcements for us tomorrow, I believe.

298
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:14,400
Thomas Jefferson once said, when the government fears the people, there is freedom.

299
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,040
But for too long now, the people have feared the government.

300
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,800
Well, in January, 2021, that changes.

301
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,440
That looks a little worse in hindsight.

302
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,480
We've been over this before, but that isn't a Thomas Jefferson quote.

303
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,600
It's from a 1914 debate against socialism delivered by John Basil Barnhill that over

304
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,280
the years has been misattributed to a bunch of people like Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson.

305
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,940
Perhaps more interestingly though, in that clip, it appears that Owen's trying to promote

306
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,240
the idea that Trump is going to show up at the rally the next day.

307
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,360
This was the first instance of an Infowars employee behaving in a way that led me to

308
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,160
believe that they had no idea people were planning to storm the Capitol the next day.

309
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,480
They are acting 100% business as usual.

310
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,680
Promoting what they expect will just be another afternoon of profitable terrorism edging that

311
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
they're going to be playing.

312
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,960
And that's kind of the vibe that I get.

313
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:14,160
And it's just, this is all like Infowars business as usual, just Owen being a dumb shithead.

314
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,480
And the theme is four more years for Donald Trump.

315
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,600
And while I all think, I think all of us can get behind that, I'd like to see a thousand

316
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:31,480
more years of human freedom and a thousand more years of the United States of America.

317
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:39,240
Then deal with climate change?

318
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
USA!

319
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,240
USA!

320
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
USA!

321
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
You dumb fuck!

322
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
It always happens.

323
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Oh my God.

324
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
They're so silly.

325
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
It always happens.

326
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
The USA chants break out so easily.

327
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,840
Do you know, here's, here's the problem.

328
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
Here's the problem with these.

329
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Oh.

330
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Here's the problem.

331
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
I'm going to give you this right now.

332
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
I'm surprised there's only one.

333
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,920
There's only one that I can see.

334
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Okay.

335
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
All right.

336
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Here's your audience.

337
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,840
Look at those dumb dumbs.

338
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,640
You can steal anything and they will have no, you stole a Thomas Jefferson quote from

339
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,260
not Thomas Jefferson and they still bought it.

340
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,960
Why wouldn't you go out there and be like, uh, uh, uh, would you rather have a Lexus

341
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
or justice?

342
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,080
A dream or some substance?

343
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Okay.

344
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,520
Why wouldn't you go dead press?

345
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Why wouldn't you do something real?

346
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,520
To quote Thomas Jefferson.

347
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
Yeah, exactly.

348
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,520
They schools don't teach us shit.

349
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:36,400
Yeah, just stay awake or try and get really fancy and just completely lie to the audience

350
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,240
is just like grapes don't exist.

351
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,640
Yeah.

352
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,960
Let's fucking shoot the moon.

353
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Yeah.

354
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
Yeah.

355
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,960
What's it?

356
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
Where's our line?

357
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
What's the line?

358
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,920
I think that, uh, the fake Thomas Jefferson quotes are just something that's so in the

359
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,480
pocket for them that it's safe territory.

360
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
You can't go wrong.

361
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
No.

362
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,480
No.

363
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,560
Um, also I would say that even under like ideal conditions, I don't know if America

364
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,360
could last another thousand years.

365
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:06,480
Climate change notwithstanding, that's still a long time for a country to, uh, I guess

366
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,040
maybe, but you know, it could still exist in some fashion, but not like super power.

367
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,700
I mean, it'll probably be more like the homie Holy Roman empire was in Germany for a while.

368
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,000
You know, like that kind of thing.

369
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,060
It would, it would be a bizarre to imagine continuing at the, the re like the status

370
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,060
thing.

371
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,060
Yeah.

372
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,060
Yeah.

373
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,060
It's for that long.

374
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,160
Small parts of Montana that cut apart.

375
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,300
It's foolish on Owen's part, but I will say, I think that Owen feels the itch to get into

376
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,680
a line of work that you and I used to explore.

377
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,680
Okay.

378
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,180
I think he wants to start doing open mics.

379
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,180
You think he wants to do a little bits?

380
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,640
Well, you remember when, uh, he took the tank down to the Austin, uh, they're getting ready

381
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,660
to go on the, uh, the caravan and he was workshopping bits to empty traffic.

382
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,660
He was doing jokes.

383
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,660
Sure.

384
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
Sure.

385
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,660
He's got a new bit.

386
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,660
Yeah.

387
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:04,500
But you know, Nancy Pelosi said that you can no longer say mother and father in Congress.

388
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Did you see this?

389
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,700
Well, I got news for Nancy Pelosi.

390
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
Trump is your daddy.

391
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:21,660
Good bit, good bit solid, solid piece of work right there or doing the, you can't say mother

392
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:29,980
and father 24 hours prior to the fall of the United States government, a nuclear power.

393
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,460
One of the leaders of the resistance said Trump is your daddy.

394
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,460
Great.

395
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,340
Uh, five years ago they did this.

396
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,380
You can't say mother and father paranoia and panic.

397
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,100
It's great to see them bringing back the hits about time.

398
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,340
So this is in response to Nancy Pelosi, uh, and, uh, the, the house updating their rule

399
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,340
book.

400
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,340
Sure.

401
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,740
The text of the rule book doesn't include gendered language, but that doesn't mean that

402
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,940
you can't say mother and father.

403
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,320
That's not like it's against the rules.

404
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,100
It's just not in the text of the rules.

405
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,660
This is like Skinner, you know, they've been doing new stuff for five years, but whenever

406
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,340
you go in public, you still got to play the hits.

407
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,340
But you know, yeah.

408
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:15,240
But this would be like, you know, you don't play free bird for a few years and then you

409
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,740
bring it out as if it has never been played before.

410
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,540
They've just been on the radio too much.

411
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,540
They haven't been in public.

412
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,140
They haven't really had that chance to get a free bird out there.

413
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,140
You know?

414
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:30,440
Um, I would say that a free bird is a long song and Owen Schroyer set is not long.

415
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,440
That's a smart move.

416
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,780
Um, this is no stairway to heaven.

417
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,580
This is a, uh, in and out.

418
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,580
Okay.

419
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,580
All right.

420
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,580
Uh, two and a half minute pop song.

421
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,660
He's getting out of there and he's a, he's a, also another standup reference.

422
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,400
It's a shotgun situation.

423
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,660
He's introducing Alex.

424
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,660
All right.

425
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,660
That's good stuff.

426
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
Coming up next.

427
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,020
It's my pleasure to introduce a man.

428
00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:01,540
It's my honor to introduce a man who was the Genesis in many ways of this second American

429
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,540
revolution.

430
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:12,620
Dear FBI, Alex Jones was in many ways the Genesis of this that started with one man

431
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:18,660
on public access television will tomorrow turn into millions of Americans in the streets

432
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:32,140
of Washington DC to take our Republic back and that man's name is really also does not

433
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,140
look great.

434
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,140
Oh man.

435
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,020
Oh, I want that on my wall.

436
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,020
Only one man on public access in Austin, Texas is responsible for everything that happens

437
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,020
tomorrow.

438
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:49,020
I just want any law enforcement entities that may be recording this speech.

439
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,180
As we speak to know this is all on Alex Jones.

440
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,300
Tomorrow will be the culmination of his professional career.

441
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:05,540
I'm just saying you want to stop this movement, get Alex Jones.

442
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,940
It's all on him.

443
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,940
It's only him.

444
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,140
I'm throwing him under the bus by way of flattery.

445
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,900
This is the greatest man who is responsible for everything.

446
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,820
I found myself feeling a lot of that like in hindsight.

447
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,820
This is terrible.

448
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,020
But then the other thing that I was feeling was that like there's a lot of stand up shit

449
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:35,260
in here like Owens doing some stand up getting the crowd to chant USA is pandery nonsense

450
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,920
and Alex basically starts his set with like give it up for yourselves.

451
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,460
He does like a give it up for the wait staff out of here.

452
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,500
I'll tell you who I'm excited to hear to see.

453
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:53,940
It's you, the American people, unified in resistance to the new world order.

454
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,220
Give yourselves a round of applause for coming out tonight.

455
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,220
Yeah.

456
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,220
Jesus.

457
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,220
What a lovely audience.

458
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,220
You guys are the best.

459
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,220
All right.

460
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,220
Okay.

461
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,540
If I'm, if I'm doing my set, I want to open with three applause breaks.

462
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,540
Doesn't matter.

463
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,180
I want to say, give it up for your wait staff.

464
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,700
Hey, give it up for yourselves for coming out tonight.

465
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:15,740
Hey, ladies and gentlemen, how about those sports teams like them or a nice gracious

466
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,740
move if maybe you're the headliner, give it up for everyone else who saw tonight.

467
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,740
Totally.

468
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,740
Absolutely.

469
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,740
That's super cool.

470
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,620
That number three in there and then get your set going.

471
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,620
Oh yes.

472
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,580
Um, so Alex at least has maybe learned that as a little bit of etiquette.

473
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,580
Sure.

474
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,400
Which I haven't seen in some of his other speeches, so I think that might be a performance

475
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
evolution on his part.

476
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,300
I mean, so many failed right wing comics are these people, so I assume Alex has spent a

477
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,100
lot more time with failed right wing comics recently.

478
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,100
It's possible.

479
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,860
And maybe he's going backwards, maybe he's Benjamin buttoning it.

480
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:52,420
Now he's going from right wing reactionary to successful comic, that would be the worst

481
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,420
part.

482
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,420
If he suddenly nails it.

483
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,420
I've seen him do stand up.

484
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,420
Okay.

485
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,420
Well, we have to.

486
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:03,980
Um, but he does have a head start on other, let's say younger comics coming up.

487
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,980
Sure.

488
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,980
And that name recognition.

489
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,980
Well, there's that.

490
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,980
Yeah.

491
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,380
But he's also got a catch phrase and he's got a catch phrase that apparently audiences

492
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,620
will chant with him.

493
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,620
Get the fuck.

494
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,620
They have tried to steal this election in front of everyone.

495
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:24,620
And as I told them 20 years ago, I tell them again, I don't know how this is going to end,

496
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:30,900
but if they want to fight, they better believe.

497
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,180
He's got his own get her done.

498
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,060
People will call and response that shit.

499
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,060
Yeah.

500
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,060
Get the fuck out.

501
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,060
Yeah.

502
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,060
That was wild.

503
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,060
I have never heard that before in my life.

504
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,060
Oh, he yells that all the time.

505
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,060
Yeah.

506
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,560
But I mean, if you, if you think, uh, you know, if you want to fight, you better believe

507
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
you got one.

508
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
That right.

509
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,560
Yeah.

510
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,620
But I mean like that was a long thing for people to remember.

511
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,620
Yeah.

512
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,620
It shocked me.

513
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,780
It's a little, it's a little, the length of the Lord's prayer.

514
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,380
I'm just saying, I don't remember all of the Lord's prayer.

515
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,300
If I was up after this, I would be worried.

516
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,780
I would start with the Lord's prayer to bring the energy down again.

517
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,060
I would be super worried because it's like, all right, either he's going to fuck this

518
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:14,220
up or I'm not going to be able to follow one of the two.

519
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,220
Yeah.

520
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,420
Anyway, he almost alienates the audience.

521
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,420
Alex Jones is the Lauren Hill of the right.

522
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:27,980
He all, he almost immediately after this, after getting a getter done style champs,

523
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,380
he almost alienates the audience by accidentally saying that Hitler was bad.

524
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,020
Hitler was a monster.

525
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:45,620
Stalin was a monster, but what Mao Zedong and Xi Jinping did overshadows their crimes

526
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:50,540
against us, against humanity.

527
00:22:50,540 --> 00:23:00,540
They commit against a Muslim, a Christian, a Buddhist, an agnostian, a Chinese, an African,

528
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,540
a North American.

529
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,540
It doesn't matter.

530
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,540
I think he's fucked up.

531
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,040
It's a crime in the eyes of God.

532
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,780
You can tell that Alex is a serious scholar of Chinese history and the Chinese Communist

533
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,780
Party because he knows the names of Mao and Xi.

534
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,880
I actually kind of think that he doesn't realize that Xi isn't Mao's successor and I'd love

535
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,980
to bring up Hu Jintao to him because then he would say who and then we'd end up in a

536
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,980
vaudeville bit.

537
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,160
I would, I would legitimately like to ask him if he knows that Chairman Mao had a wife.

538
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,140
I would be interested to know if he thinks that the whole time it was just him.

539
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,140
I don't know.

540
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,140
You know?

541
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,540
I don't think he knows a whole lot more than a couple of names.

542
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,660
I think that you might be right.

543
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,260
Some broad strokes and maybe something he read in a JBS pamphlet.

544
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,260
Could be.

545
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,140
Leaving that aside, it's important to understand that Alex is lying to this audience in a very,

546
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,760
very real way.

547
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,240
He doesn't care at all what China does to the Uyghur population of Muslims except when

548
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,840
he can use their pain as a weapon against his own enemies.

549
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,220
In this case, he's in front of a crowd so he wants to establish the moral high ground

550
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,340
against their imaginary evil enemies who support China's treatment of Muslims.

551
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,780
When he's alone on his own show speaking freely, he sounds a little bit different like he did

552
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,820
on May 26th.

553
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:20,580
But from Michigan to Texas, from London to Los Angeles, from Rio de Janeiro to Berlin,

554
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,580
there are call to prayers.

555
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:26,100
I don't like to call it as Chinese but they don't put up with that because they know it's

556
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,180
a group trying to take them over.

557
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,440
Hey, Chai-Coms, do your thing.

558
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,660
Don't try to take me over.

559
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,660
Do your thing.

560
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,660
Do your thing, Chai-Coms.

561
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,660
Come on, man.

562
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,420
Talking about their repressive treatment to certain Muslim populations.

563
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,420
No, he cares.

564
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,420
Do your thing.

565
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,420
No, he cares.

566
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,420
He cares.

567
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,420
Well, when it's useful.

568
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,420
I mean, yeah.

569
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,140
What Alex is doing here on stage is exactly what he and his friends accuse the entire

570
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,180
left of doing, virtue signaling.

571
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:54,940
Alex doesn't care about how China treats Muslims because if Alex had his way, the only Muslims

572
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,220
that would be allowed in America would be the ones who agreed to convert to his bizarre

573
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,780
idiotic version of Christianity.

574
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,700
Quite simply, Alex is using the false impression that he's offended by how the Chinese government

575
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,020
treats the Uyghurs in order to pretend that his criticisms of China come from a sensible

576
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:15,260
and real place, when in reality, they're mostly just re-warmed up, John Birch society, Cold

577
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,260
War nonsense.

578
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

579
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,260
Yep.

580
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,740
It's a bummer, but also Alex does seem a little bit fucked up.

581
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,740
He seems a little messed up.

582
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,340
He's having a good time.

583
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
Yes.

584
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,340
I agree.

585
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:32,680
There are currently, I would say, on the countdown of ways to learn, we've gone from ten to about

586
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
eight.

587
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
Jordan.

588
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,980
When he gets down to a four, we know we're fucked up.

589
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,380
Right now, there are eight ways to learn.

590
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,220
I would say that he's having a good time, and more importantly, he has had a good time

591
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,780
before this.

592
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,780
That's fair.

593
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,780
He's been having a good time.

594
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,780
That's a fair characterization.

595
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,180
And I think, like I was saying, he's gassed.

596
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,760
He has no cardio.

597
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,900
If you're a comic and you want to be a high-energy comic, you'll quickly learn that if you're

598
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,100
out of shape, you're going to have a really tough time with that.

599
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,140
You see comics who are maybe a little bit more energetic.

600
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,180
Sometimes they'll be sweating, and it's because it's hard.

601
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,060
It's hard to keep that energy up.

602
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,060
Oh yeah.

603
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,060
And I think Alex is learning.

604
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,060
I'm sweating now.

605
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,300
We're only a half hour in.

606
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,300
Alex is learning this the hard way.

607
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:20,300
And just as authoritarians throughout history have bet on the Bolsheviks, and bet on the

608
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:28,340
Nazis, and bet on every other form of tyranny, their bet will fail.

609
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,860
I guess you're right.

610
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:38,580
Because there is a God that created the universe, and there is a God that inspired our republic,

611
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:46,860
and there is a God in the control of the affairs of humans, and that God will see us through

612
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,660
if we are loyal.

613
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,480
I don't know if it came through as well on the audio, but you can tell he's getting his

614
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,580
breath after just about every other word.

615
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,640
And it doesn't look comfortable.

616
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,420
But he also gets into safe territory to start this getting into religion.

617
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,680
Get into God.

618
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,060
Get in or get out.

619
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,060
Yeah.

620
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,420
And once you start talking about religion, it's important that you level with the audience.

621
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,420
You gotta be real.

622
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,420
Sure.

623
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,420
You gotta be real.

624
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,420
Let's hear this one.

625
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,420
But make no mistake.

626
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,740
Make no mistake.

627
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,860
I'm like being completely honest with you here.

628
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,860
Things are gonna be rough.

629
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,860
I'm drunk.

630
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,860
I'm in bed.

631
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,860
I'm kind of shitfaced.

632
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,660
We've already allowed the murder of 60 million babies in this country.

633
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,660
I took a lot out of it.

634
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,300
We've done so many other evil things.

635
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,300
So we're deep down in the water.

636
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,900
We're hundreds of feet deep.

637
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,500
It's gonna be hard swimming back to the surface.

638
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,960
And not everybody is gonna make it.

639
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,500
But that's okay.

640
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:55,340
Because in the end, God will fulfill his destiny and will reward the righteous.

641
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,740
Outside of some surface level stuff, this is exactly the kind of speech I would expect

642
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,480
to hear at an ISIS rally.

643
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,420
You know, there'd be some different decoration and some different themes maybe, but this

644
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
is...

645
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,420
Totally.

646
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,420
This is culty.

647
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,780
Yeah, these guys are ISIS.

648
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,980
It's really messed up.

649
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:20,940
I am so happy to remember how many times people told me years ago, don't call them ISIS.

650
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,140
That's offensive.

651
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,140
That's too much.

652
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,140
Mwah!

653
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,140
They're ISIS.

654
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,140
They're ISIS.

655
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,140
Love it.

656
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,140
Love it.

657
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,140
I...

658
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,140
Fuck you, the past.

659
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:35,140
Well, I mean, it's possible for you to have been onto something and also wrong them.

660
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,940
I am aware.

661
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,940
I am aware.

662
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,180
Uh, but maybe not now.

663
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:47,300
Just as we see in the Bible and just as we see in history, God rises up men who are real.

664
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:53,780
Not men that are perfect, not men that are above reproach, but real men like President

665
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,780
Trump.

666
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:59,340
Who has fought hard for our Republic.

667
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,660
Who's fought hard for justice.

668
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:10,140
Who's done the best job he can and because he has represented us, he is under attack.

669
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:20,660
So we hold up President Trump before the creator of the universe and we say thank you for trying

670
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:27,300
to send us a deliverer, though he's not perfect as we are, but we pray for him and we pray

671
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,300
for America and we hold him up in this hour of peril.

672
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,860
Sounds like his voice is about to bottom out, too, like...

673
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:37,100
Give up the gasoline, road warrior.

674
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,100
Wow.

675
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,100
Thank you.

676
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,100
All right.

677
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,100
Okay.

678
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,780
Thank you, God, for sending Trump as a deliverer.

679
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,940
Oh boy.

680
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:55,300
It's funny to hear that speech broadcast on TV and know it.

681
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,380
I'm not positive that this speech was broadcast on TV.

682
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
Oh, that's fair.

683
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,380
That's fair.

684
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:05,220
I meant in a more ethereal sense of it, traveling throughout space.

685
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,220
It's sent to a satellite.

686
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,220
Sure.

687
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,620
It's on the right side broadcast network.

688
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:15,100
To space and then sent back down, sent around everywhere, all of this happening instantly.

689
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:21,020
In his pocket is a small little brick with all of human history recorded inside of it.

690
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,340
And he's like, we've got Trump as our deliverer because of God.

691
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,340
It's super weird.

692
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,340
What world do we live in?

693
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,380
It's super weird, too, to imagine that signal going into people's homes and then at least

694
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,660
one person is watching it like, damn right.

695
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,660
Yeah.

696
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

697
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,660
That's very bizarre to me.

698
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,660
Like, seeing this...

699
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,140
You realize a miracle's in your face.

700
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:44,180
Well, I mean, seeing this speech, it's like, yeah, yeah.

701
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,660
I get what Alex is doing.

702
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,500
Like, I kind of understand what he's up to.

703
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,100
It's baffling to me to imagine that, you know, people are like...

704
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,100
Wild.

705
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,100
Yeah, this is good.

706
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,100
Yeah, man.

707
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,100
This is...

708
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,100
Totally.

709
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
This is entertainment.

710
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,100
Absolutely.

711
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,100
Or like, this is inspiring.

712
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,100
You know who my favorite character...

713
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,100
Fucked up.

714
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,100
...in Fury Road was?

715
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,100
Immortan Joe.

716
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,580
I thought he was the guy I wanted to follow.

717
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,500
Ride or die, Immortan Joe.

718
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,020
Well, it could not be worse than Bill Gates.

719
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,020
Okay.

720
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,020
I know that.

721
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,020
Okay.

722
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,020
Yeah.

723
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,020
I was looking around on band.video.

724
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,020
Okay.

725
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:23,020
And there's a new section on there, and it's just titled, Bill Gates is Evil.

726
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,020
I guess...

727
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,020
That's also a folder I have on my desktop, but yeah, yeah.

728
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,140
I guess that's what Alex is doing instead of making that documentary about Bill Gates.

729
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,180
He's just got a place where he's posted some shitty videos about him.

730
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,180
That's nice.

731
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,180
Organize it.

732
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,180
Yeah.

733
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,180
But he doesn't run the world, that Bill Gates.

734
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,180
What is God in control of human destiny?

735
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:49,740
Not Bill Gates, not Warren Buffet, not Lord Rothschild, not the globalist.

736
00:31:49,740 --> 00:32:01,500
And it's that simple understanding that God of the universe is in control, not the globalist

737
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,220
who want to play God.

738
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:12,140
We recognize God, we connect with God, and we transcend the Satanist by doing that.

739
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,460
I think people were worried about when that sentence was gonna end.

740
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,460
Yeah.

741
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,460
Yeah, that one kept going.

742
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,460
That one kept going.

743
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,460
I think Alex didn't.

744
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,940
He was trying to find his feet.

745
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,540
I don't mind a run-on sentence.

746
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,180
I don't mind one, but there are times when you shouldn't.

747
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,180
Yeah.

748
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:32,140
It felt like the sentence was as drunk as Alex appears to be, just sort of staggering

749
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,140
forward.

750
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,700
There you go.

751
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,940
So this next thing that Alex says also doesn't look great in hindsight.

752
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,960
Tomorrow is a great day.

753
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,500
We don't quietly take the election fraud, we don't quietly take the scam and believe

754
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
they're BS.

755
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,940
We've seen the evidence.

756
00:32:53,940 --> 00:33:02,500
The system has had to desperately engage in this gambit to maintain control, but this

757
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,300
will be their Waterloo.

758
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,380
This will be their destruction.

759
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,940
Doesn't look great.

760
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,380
I would say that if I were Alex and I were confronted with that, I would be like, I wasn't

761
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,700
talking about Waterloo, the battle.

762
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

763
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,860
I was talking about the ABBA song.

764
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,460
This is all political.

765
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,460
Political only.

766
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,940
I am not talking about literal events.

767
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,140
Yeah, that would be smart.

768
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,740
Depicting war.

769
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,260
So now here was my concern when I was talking about being the person who comes up after

770
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,000
him is like, he's going to lose the crowd.

771
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,740
This is like, you can't keep this up.

772
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,700
This is like, he's going to, he's burning up, coming in hot and he's going to burn out

773
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,700
fast.

774
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,620
And Ornie Adams up next, wait, what?

775
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:50,020
Alex starts dipping his toes into COVID denial and he starts losing the audience a little

776
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,020
bit.

777
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,020
They're like, ah, we're just not here.

778
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,020
Come on, man.

779
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,020
This is about this.

780
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,020
Cool.

781
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,020
But we're not here for this.

782
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,100
This is a stop the steal rally.

783
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:05,260
And the world is watching every thing you do with the big tech censorship and the economic

784
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:12,820
attacks and the COVID lockdowns and the UN martial law world government foretold for

785
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:23,100
thousands of years is now upon us and it's pathetic and it will be defeated.

786
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:30,900
We finally face the world government chicken little witch hunt system and we have the deaths

787
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:43,220
of 2020 from the CDC 61,000 more people died in 2020 and when you count, when you count

788
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:59,460
the drug addiction, the drug overdose and suicide, less people died in 2020, 2019 is

789
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,460
broken.

790
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,460
That wasn't me.

791
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,300
Have to go out and you have to expose it.

792
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,620
It's fallen apart a little bit.

793
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,620
Yeah.

794
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,620
I think you should have left that one alone.

795
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,620
Yeah.

796
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,620
The wheels are off the wagon.

797
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,620
I was just making up numbers.

798
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,620
Alex is a little bit drunk now.

799
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,700
Alex is a little bit too drunk to stay on target.

800
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,500
I think he's just, you know, it got good to him.

801
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,140
He was feeling like sometimes you'll be on stage, like your first three bits will land

802
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,140
and you're like, I'm going to try out something new.

803
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,220
I'm just, nope, I fucked up.

804
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:34,420
No, I think he's in a, I think he's in a nice little world of like, hold on, I'm going to

805
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,420
do one more bit.

806
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,420
That last one didn't land, so I'm going to do one more bit and then that one lands and

807
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,220
you're like, oh shit, I'm going to do one more after that.

808
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,220
I'm going to push it.

809
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,900
I'm going to keep letting this ride.

810
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,140
No one's going to get this, but he's Mike Sheehan again.

811
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,140
Yeah, exactly.

812
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,140
Yeah.

813
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,340
Um, yeah, I would say that's about right.

814
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:56,060
Um, so when you, when you're in that circumstance, the only thing you can do is retreat back

815
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,620
to what was working.

816
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,620
Yeah.

817
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,580
Try and be like, okay, I was being dirty earlier.

818
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,820
I tried to be like more introspective and observational.

819
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,820
They didn't like that.

820
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,180
Gotta go back to dick jokes.

821
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,340
Don't be mean to Hitler.

822
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,980
I realized that if you're mean to Hitler, it's bad.

823
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,980
Yeah.

824
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,980
Yeah.

825
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,980
Popping the crowd.

826
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,980
Let's go back to religion.

827
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:22,060
So we must now pray for president Trump and lift him up to God and ask God to give him

828
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:30,060
the guidance and the discernment and the leadership to make the decisions in God's plan that bring

829
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:34,220
down the new world order.

830
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,220
Got him back a little bit.

831
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,220
All right.

832
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,220
Yeah.

833
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,220
All right.

834
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,220
Back on his side a bit.

835
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,220
It should be harder than that.

836
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,220
These people are not very smart.

837
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,380
They believe things like that, like that fake Jefferson quote earlier, and now Alex pulls

838
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,900
out a fake Churchill quote.

839
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:54,660
Churchill gave up a famous speech where he said, all I can promise you was blood and

840
00:36:54,660 --> 00:37:05,700
pain and war and suffering, but the alternative is even worse, total slavery.

841
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,820
So we don't care what the new world order does.

842
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:20,860
We commit to Christ and we commit to war against the globalist with the truth and we will never

843
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,860
surrender.

844
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:27,660
I may be wrong and I'm open to admitting that if Alex will go ahead and provide that citation,

845
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,060
but I think the quote he's trying to remember is from Churchill's first speech as prime

846
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,880
minister in the House of Commons in 1940.

847
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,620
The part Alex I think is misquoting is, quote, in this crisis I hope I may be pardoned if

848
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,140
I do not address the House at any length today.

849
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,880
I hope that any of my friends and colleagues or former colleagues who are affected by the

850
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,520
political reconstruction will make allowance, all allowance, for any lack of ceremony with

851
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,660
which it has been necessary to act.

852
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,900
I would say to the House, as I say to those who have joined this government, I have nothing

853
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,220
to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.

854
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,860
The blood, toil, tears, and sweat thing is an attempt to stress to his government that

855
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,580
he's working hard despite a short speech.

856
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,020
I'm promising you the blood.

857
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,060
After this, Churchill comments on his strategy for fighting World War II, which is the other

858
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:17,780
part of what I think Alex is mixing up here, quote, you ask what is our policy?

859
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,540
I can say it is to wage war, by sea, land, and air, with all our might and with all our

860
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,340
strength that God can give us.

861
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:29,500
To wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalog

862
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,980
of human crime.

863
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,340
That is our policy.

864
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,560
You ask what is our aim?

865
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,060
I can answer in one word.

866
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,220
It is victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long

867
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,340
and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival.

868
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,420
So the elements of- Slightly more eloquent than Alex makes it

869
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,420
sound.

870
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,420
Yeah.

871
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,420
I will give you blood.

872
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:58,400
I am reminded of the great Churchill quote, what is best in life?

873
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,900
To crush your enemies with blood, see them driven before you, and hear the levitations

874
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,860
of the weapons!

875
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,620
Yeah, that wasn't good.

876
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:15,120
I think that that is definitely the quote that he's mixing up, because-

877
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
It sounds right.

878
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:22,020
Whenever he does his really shitty Churchill impression, that's the, by land, by air.

879
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,620
That's the quote that he does, so I assume it's the only reference he has.

880
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,540
It's whatever pull he has and however he's changed it in the moment in his drunken, idle

881
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,540
brain.

882
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,540
Yeah.

883
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:36,060
I know that a lot of people are struggling, I think a lot of people had a tough time with

884
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:40,980
watching the events that unfolded on Wednesday, and granted this is Tuesday, but Alex still

885
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,100
recognizes that there's a lot of people in pain, and maybe some people in the audience

886
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,100
are feeling in pain.

887
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,100
Sure.

888
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,100
And they shouldn't.

889
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,100
This is his message of- Unity.

890
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,100
No.

891
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,100
No hope.

892
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,100
God no.

893
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,100
No.

894
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
No.

895
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,100
This is what he's- He's bringing the country together, this is how he's-

896
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,100
He wants to comfort anybody in the audience who might be feeling alone.

897
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,100
Alright, good.

898
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:08,140
No matter if you're in a jail cell, or no matter if you're dying of cancer, or no matter

899
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:14,580
if your car broke down in the middle of the desert, the God of the universe built you,

900
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,300
and the God of the universe loves you.

901
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:24,220
And the God of the universe will deliver and fulfill you, but you must have faith and open

902
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,220
that channel.

903
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:31,140
And that's why, in closing, I'm so honored to be here tonight.

904
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,140
Okay.

905
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,140
Alright.

906
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,420
I love the idea of Owen Schroyer sitting off stage left and just being like, this guy's

907
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,420
got the goods.

908
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,420
This is- I will follow- Oh captain, my captain.

909
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,940
You sitting there taking notes?

910
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,180
Or Owen is in the back listening to his set.

911
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,820
He'd recorded his set.

912
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, in order to improve later, because he's got another set to do

913
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,100
later on tonight.

914
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,100
Yeah, yeah.

915
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,460
He's got another set for his buddy to get done with his set, so they can both get in

916
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,500
the car and go to fucking hidden shamrock.

917
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,500
Why not do it?

918
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,100
Although, I do hear that, and I kind of think to myself, it would be really interesting

919
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,420
to see Alex Jones' motivational speaker.

920
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:14,060
You know, like, hey, hey, you lost your job, you lost your job, that sucks, it sucks, man,

921
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,420
it sucks, but guess what?

922
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,940
You're made in God's image.

923
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:24,220
No matter what you got, he just minimizes your problem, and he just tells you that God

924
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,820
made you out of stardust or whatever.

925
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,020
Hey, I know you're poor.

926
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,020
God's fine with that though.

927
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,020
Come on now.

928
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,020
Let's get it together.

929
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,020
Let's move on.

930
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,020
Let's move on.

931
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,220
So here's the end of Alex's speech, and where we will leave the Stop the Steal rally from

932
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,220
January 5th.

933
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,220
The globalists want to play God.

934
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,220
They are not God.

935
00:41:40,220 --> 00:42:00,220
And the answer to their 1984 charity is 1776, 1776, 1776, 1776.

936
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:09,220
I'm so honored to be here with General Flynn and Roger Stone and others coming up, but

937
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:14,620
they are just as important as you are, whether you be black, whether you be white, whether

938
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:21,420
you be old, whether you be young, God made you, and God loves you, and they will never

939
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,980
separate us.

940
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,220
We will prevail.

941
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,220
Amen.

942
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,220
Whoa.

943
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,220
Wild.

944
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,220
Very weird.

945
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,220
Yeah.

946
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,780
You gotta end on 1776.

947
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,780
You bet.

948
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,780
The end.

949
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,780
End of set.

950
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,780
Yep.

951
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,780
Walk off.

952
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,820
You've completely blanked on who else is speaking.

953
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,820
Nope.

954
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,820
Except for General Flynn.

955
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,820
Nope.

956
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,820
You don't need to end with amen.

957
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,820
Uh-uh.

958
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,820
It's a weird ramble.

959
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,820
None of it.

960
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,820
Yeah, you can end with the chanting of 1776.

961
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,820
You nailed it.

962
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:53,020
Although he does still leave the question in your mind, what does he think that means?

963
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,140
You got people storming the Capitol the next day.

964
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,140
Yeah.

965
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:01,180
You got him inspiring chants of 1776, 1774.

966
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,180
Sure.

967
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,180
Sure.

968
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,180
It kind of, I mean, look.

969
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,040
I don't understand what you're, are you drawing a connection between the two?

970
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,040
I'm not necessarily.

971
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,180
I'm just saying there's a narrative consistency.

972
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:15,200
That's one way of putting it.

973
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,740
If these two events were in a fictional story and the author were arguing that one led to

974
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,460
the other, it would make sense.

975
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,580
It would make sense, yes.

976
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,100
I'm not saying that they do.

977
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,740
I'm not saying that Alex did cause anything.

978
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,980
I'm just saying.

979
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,820
From an entropy standpoint, if you were going to put one in front of the other, I think

980
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,260
you know which you would choose.

981
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:40,500
So now we go to the sixth and we will be here for a while.

982
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,940
We'll be spending a little bit of time in the Infowars Trenches, yes.

983
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:50,580
But it doesn't happen until almost the end of Alex's show.

984
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,580
Sure.

985
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,620
Actually, it's probably in the second hour, I think is when the actual like going over

986
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,620
the barricades.

987
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

988
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,620
When it started popping off.

989
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:02,380
And then it proceeded to get wild pretty fast.

990
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:09,800
And yeah, we'll deal with that as best we can as we go along.

991
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,580
But we're still in this sort of much more innocent time now because we're listening

992
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,100
to the American Journal.

993
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,100
Sure.

994
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,460
Which again is supposed to be a call-in show.

995
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,460
There's no calls.

996
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,460
There's no calls.

997
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,460
No calls.

998
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,460
Zero calls?

999
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,460
Not even one call.

1000
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,720
I remember Alex saying that whoever's hosting this show, if they're not taking calls, they're

1001
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,220
not going to be hosting it anymore.

1002
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,220
So bad news, Harrison.

1003
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,220
You're fired.

1004
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:36,660
We are going to get a 17-year-old host very shortly.

1005
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,820
I think we already have one.

1006
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,820
Oh, that's true.

1007
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,300
Harrison could be a baby for all I know.

1008
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,840
I think he's like a high school sophomore.

1009
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,840
He's there on an internship.

1010
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,840
Sure, sure.

1011
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,840
He's not even getting paid.

1012
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,020
He's the AV Club guy.

1013
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,940
He's got an extra block free and they let him do a work program.

1014
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,940
Yeah, yeah.

1015
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,940
I gotcha.

1016
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,740
Alex is sponsoring him at the local college or high school.

1017
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,740
Yeah, he gets credit.

1018
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,740
Yeah, I like it.

1019
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:03,100
The news of the day for him at the beginning is that there's this Trump rally that's going

1020
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:08,020
to be going on, but also Georgia got stolen.

1021
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,020
Wow.

1022
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,020
What do you expect?

1023
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,020
They haven't been punished.

1024
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,620
Of course, they're going to do it again.

1025
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,240
And so they did it again.

1026
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,740
And so Georgia looks like it was lost.

1027
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:24,060
I think one of the, I'll get an update here, but as far as I know, both races are projected

1028
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:33,340
to be Democrat victories, although one is still on that hairline victory margin.

1029
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,500
Donald Trump Jr. is live right now on the stage.

1030
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,500
I want to go to him.

1031
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,260
He, I think, has a major future.

1032
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:44,820
If there's anybody that could succeed his father, I remember seeing him give a speech

1033
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:49,900
at the RNC in 2016 and thinking, I'm putting my money on this guy.

1034
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:55,460
This guy, uh, this guy can carry his father's mantle and keep that torch lit.

1035
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,220
Let's go to him now and watch this live feed.

1036
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,340
This Don Jr. kid's got something.

1037
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,340
Wow.

1038
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,340
Yeah.

1039
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,340
So he's the future.

1040
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,400
I think Harrison's the future for sure.

1041
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,060
The way he intro'd that clip made me real excited to hear what I wanted to hear.

1042
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,060
Yeah.

1043
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,020
Georgia has been stolen again because they didn't get punished for stealing last time.

1044
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,020
Yeah.

1045
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,020
Why not?

1046
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,340
Uh, I found myself very bored listening to Harrison, but I do think that he has a word

1047
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,340
a day calendar.

1048
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,340
Oh yeah?

1049
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,980
Uh, because he would not stop fucking saying abrogate.

1050
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,580
He said abrogate a lot?

1051
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,580
All right, get the fuck out of here.

1052
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,220
I was going to make a super cut of it, but I got to like three or four times that I'd

1053
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,940
cut it out and I was just like, I don't even care anymore.

1054
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,800
You get at most one abrogate per week.

1055
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,800
These people.

1056
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,800
Max.

1057
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,800
Mike Pence has abrogated.

1058
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,800
See, max.

1059
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,800
Yeah.

1060
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,800
One.

1061
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,800
It's a mess.

1062
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,800
Yeah.

1063
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,860
Anyway, there's a lot of stuff that I was listening to that would have just sounded

1064
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:51,660
like, oh, look at this braggy bullshit if people hadn't rushed the Capitol building.

1065
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,660
Yeah.

1066
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:53,660
Yeah.

1067
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:59,580
In hindsight, there's a lot of stuff that doesn't look great.

1068
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,740
Here is one of them.

1069
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,740
Okay.

1070
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,700
Truly incredible stuff.

1071
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:08,960
Of course, what we have just learned and I'm excited to share once again is that president

1072
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,740
Donald Trump himself personally asked Alex Jones to lead this March following Alex Jones

1073
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,740
a speech.

1074
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:17,740
He will be at the Vanguard.

1075
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,500
I guess he didn't want to win to the Capitol and it's a, it's truly incredible.

1076
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,460
And guys, let's just go ahead and leave that live feed up.

1077
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,180
We can leave me in a box just because it's not me.

1078
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,420
People are tuning in for, it's the incredible events going down in Washington.

1079
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,420
You're right.

1080
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,420
No one's doing it for you.

1081
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,420
That's for sure.

1082
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,420
God damn right.

1083
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,420
You are.

1084
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:40,980
I would say that now, uh, it would probably be, you know, had they have known that people

1085
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,180
were going to storm the Capitol, I don't think they would've lied that big.

1086
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:50,260
No, I would assume that the storyline wouldn't be Alex Jones was personally asked by Trump

1087
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,260
to leave the March from the speech to the Capitol building.

1088
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,260
Yeah.

1089
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,260
Yeah.

1090
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,260
That doesn't seem like, I would want that one off my resume pretty quick.

1091
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,260
Yeah.

1092
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,260
Yeah.

1093
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,580
Um, also this looks just kind of silly in hindsight.

1094
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,860
That's the message that we need to tell the police is you're a human being.

1095
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,140
You're not a robot.

1096
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,820
You know what's going on here.

1097
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,620
You know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are.

1098
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,020
Shouldn't be confusing to you.

1099
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:18,260
Shouldn't be up in the air for you when you have hordes of, you know, just black lives

1100
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:23,780
matter, just failures, just supported by the state coming out to the Capitol city to try

1101
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:28,500
to burn down buildings, to try to tear down statues, just yell at police and call them

1102
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,020
all sorts of horrible things.

1103
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:34,660
Then you have interest from protesters marching, saying thank you to the cops saying, you know,

1104
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,660
we support you.

1105
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,660
Interesting.

1106
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,420
It's not too difficult to know who the bad guys are and who the good guys are a couple

1107
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,420
hours later.

1108
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:46,020
Interesting, interesting things you're saying a couple hours later, not so thrilled with

1109
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,020
the cops.

1110
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:52,220
Perhaps, perhaps you may not be viewing yourselves through the appropriate lens.

1111
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,620
I think I might be right.

1112
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:59,620
So one of the things I found really interesting is Harrison's doing play by play of this Trump

1113
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,620
rally.

1114
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:06,580
And so you had Don Jr. who's this fresh upstart, he's got a bright future ahead of him.

1115
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:13,340
Now there is an actual GOP upstart who's really like kind of a hot commodity in the right

1116
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,820
wing, and that is Madison Cawthorn.

1117
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Nazi who's in a wheelchair.

1118
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,140
Yeah, and he's like 25 or something like that.

1119
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,180
It doesn't take long for him to go full Nazi.

1120
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:25,580
Like he looks like the person you would want on all kinds of ad campaigns.

1121
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,580
Yeah, absolutely.

1122
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,660
I mean, if he weren't a Nazi.

1123
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:33,860
Sure, I don't, I don't know enough about his politics to really parse everything, but based

1124
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,780
on the speech, I'm not thrilled with him.

1125
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,780
But it's interesting.

1126
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:43,020
I do still know who he is, square jaw and all.

1127
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,260
Sure, sure.

1128
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,260
Sure.

1129
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,260
Yeah.

1130
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,260
Handsome.

1131
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,260
Yeah.

1132
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,180
But Harrison doesn't know who he is.

1133
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,180
Really?

1134
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:54,260
Madison Cawthorn comes up to give the speech.

1135
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,460
He's up like next and he's like Madison something?

1136
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,460
That's fantastic.

1137
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:05,820
Yeah, this is, I believe his name is, he's a new, he's a new congressman, I believe his

1138
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:11,900
name is, I'm blanking on his name right now, Madison or something, but he was just elected.

1139
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,380
He's promised to stand up for Trump against Stop the Steal.

1140
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,380
Wild.

1141
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,460
Just the depth of awareness.

1142
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:23,700
I want this to be Info Wars' new entire tone.

1143
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,220
I want Harrison Smith to host every show.

1144
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,420
I think this is dynamite stuff here.

1145
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:32,180
Greg looks familiar.

1146
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:37,140
So Madison Cawthorn's up there doing his, doing his speech and just to show that everyone

1147
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,140
is a dork.

1148
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:43,420
My friends, I want you to chant with me so loud that the cowards on White Washington

1149
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,420
DC that I serve with can hear you.

1150
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:50,180
While I leave, let's get a chance so Donald Trump knows who supports him.

1151
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,180
USA!

1152
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,180
USA!

1153
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,180
USA!

1154
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,180
USA!

1155
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,620
Love that USA chant.

1156
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,900
It is a parody of a parody at this point.

1157
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,900
It is.

1158
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,900
Yeah, it's bizarre.

1159
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:01,900
It really is.

1160
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:02,900
Yeah.

1161
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,900
Speaking of parodies of parodies.

1162
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,900
Yeah.

1163
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,900
Up next, Rudy Giuliani.

1164
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,900
Oh!

1165
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,900
Here we go!

1166
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,860
Rudy is giving a speech and man, man oh man.

1167
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:16,900
So a lot of people took issue with him saying that he suggests trial by combat and then

1168
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,300
people stormed the White House.

1169
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,980
Yeah, which is objectively hilarious.

1170
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,380
It is, it is, because it's a poor choice of words.

1171
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:30,620
No, look, I mean, I get why you would be hand-wringing over that.

1172
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,620
I understand it.

1173
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,620
I do too.

1174
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:36,220
But nobody says trial by combat meaning storm a building.

1175
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,940
Sure, it means one-on-one combat in Game of Thrones.

1176
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,220
It means a duel, it means, yeah, yeah.

1177
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,380
He was being very flowery and stupid.

1178
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,380
But even so, that's not what he was talking about.

1179
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,380
No, of course not.

1180
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,540
If you actually listen to the context, he's talking about the reputation of Donald Trump

1181
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,500
versus the reputation of Joe Biden.

1182
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,500
Totally.

1183
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,500
And he's just trying to argue-

1184
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,980
The Mountain versus the Sand Snakes or whatever, that's what it, yeah, yeah.

1185
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,060
He's saying trial by combat, he's not talking about the two of them actually fighting.

1186
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,060
Of course.

1187
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:05,840
He wants ten days, his whole argument is he wants ten days for them to go on a fucking

1188
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:11,220
fishing experiment, expedition, and try and find something in the ballots that they can

1189
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,220
make an argument, but of course he's not presenting it that way.

1190
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:18,500
He's saying it'll take ten days for them to find the fraud that they already know is there

1191
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,500
or something.

1192
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,980
What a fantastic, arbitrary measure of time.

1193
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:21,980
Yeah.

1194
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:22,980
I love ten.

1195
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:23,980
Ten days.

1196
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:24,980
Exactly ten.

1197
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:31,900
So over the next ten days, we get to see the machines that are crooked, the ballots that

1198
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:36,380
are fraudulent, and if we're wrong, we will be made fools of.

1199
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,640
Too late.

1200
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:43,300
But if we're right, a lot of them will go to jail.

1201
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:52,180
So let's have trial by combat.

1202
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:57,740
I'm willing to stake, I'm willing to stake my reputation, the president is willing to

1203
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:04,400
stake his reputation, on the fact that we're going to find criminality there.

1204
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,920
If I were Rudy Giuliani and I could get anyone to gamble against my reputation, I don't care

1205
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,520
what I stand to win, I'm taking that bet.

1206
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,720
His reputation ain't worth shit.

1207
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,980
I can't think of two reputations more worthless at this point in time.

1208
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:18,980
Amazing.

1209
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:23,980
Rudy Giuliani, I'm gambling for like a sandwich against my reputation.

1210
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:30,260
Everything that I have, every bit of my reputation, from 9-11's mayor to standing in front of

1211
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:34,100
the Four Seasons Landscaping Company, yeah.

1212
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:40,340
So I got a little bored at this point, because Harrison is really just, you know, covering

1213
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:46,180
these speeches, and it's a lot of speeches, and so I was actually pretty pumped to see

1214
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,180
this.

1215
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,740
It was an amazing, exclusive interview.

1216
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:54,340
Right now we have an exclusive, we are on the line with Rob Dew, who is there at the

1217
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,660
Save America March, live on the ground.

1218
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:02,620
Thanks for connecting with us, Rob, I know it's difficult to get cell phone signal there

1219
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,780
with all of the massive crowds.

1220
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,060
What is it like there on the ground, Rob?

1221
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:11,860
It's a sea of patriots, it's a sea of happy people, really.

1222
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,260
How do you land this interview?

1223
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,980
How do you get the exclusive?

1224
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:19,020
I cannot believe you would describe that as an exclusive.

1225
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,900
Oh man.

1226
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:25,580
It is also technically one of the most accurate ways you can use the word exclusive.

1227
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:26,580
Yeah.

1228
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,580
I agree.

1229
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:30,860
I just love to imagine that all the networks are knocking down Rob Dew's door.

1230
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:31,860
We gotta get Rob Dew!

1231
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,100
We gotta get Rob Dew!

1232
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:38,700
Guys, I would love to go on Fox News today, but I've got an exclusive with Harrison Smith.

1233
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,820
Sorry, I have an exclusivity deal.

1234
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:41,940
Promised it earlier today.

1235
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,780
Because they really want my analysis.

1236
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,780
I gotta get the Dew in there, you know?

1237
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:54,140
So Rob Dew, ever the fumbly dum-dum, I can't even come up with the right words to express

1238
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,980
how much of a goof this guy is.

1239
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,100
I believe he's just schlemazel.

1240
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,100
Sure.

1241
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,100
Yeah.

1242
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,580
He's gotta come in and get a little piece of that pie.

1243
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:07,180
And that pie, of course, is saying things that look really bad in hindsight.

1244
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:10,820
Right when the president starts speaking, about halfway through, Alex is gonna pull

1245
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:16,060
out and then we're gonna lead that march to the capitol to surround it and let these thugs

1246
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:20,180
that are trying to steal our republic know what's gonna happen to them if they do go

1247
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,420
through with their dastardly deeds.

1248
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,860
Yeah, and you know, I wish I was there.

1249
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,820
I mean, the energy must be amazing.

1250
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:32,340
So I guess Rob is expressing that the intention of the march is to scare the Congress into

1251
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:35,860
not certifying the results of the election, which is cool.

1252
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:40,620
What they need to know is that we are a threat to them, physically.

1253
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,660
They should be scared for their lives.

1254
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,820
What we're gonna do to them.

1255
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:48,580
And we are going to follow through on that threat should they not give us what we want.

1256
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,580
Yeah, exactly.

1257
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,580
So, Arizona's pumped.

1258
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,580
Of course.

1259
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,580
All right, folks.

1260
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:55,580
So Donald Trump coming up next, Alex Jones leading the march to the capitol.

1261
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:56,580
What are we doing?

1262
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:57,580
What are we doing?

1263
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:03,860
It's January 6th, 2021, and the revolution, the second American revolution has begun.

1264
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,100
He can't quite do that out to break like Alex does.

1265
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,380
It won't go the distance.

1266
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,580
It will go fast.

1267
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,580
Yeah.

1268
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:15,380
And Alex does that thing where he goes out to break with some overly dramatic, really

1269
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,740
exciting thing.

1270
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:22,340
You can see he's trying to do some of Alex's tricks, but he just can't.

1271
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,340
He doesn't have it.

1272
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,340
No.

1273
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:29,180
And it's also embarrassing, again, to know that a couple hours after this, people storm

1274
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,180
the capitol.

1275
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,060
I think it's a little bit weird that...

1276
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:38,020
I understand being nervous, but it's not like this is Harrison Smith's first time on mic.

1277
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,140
Like he's been on mic for a long time.

1278
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,140
Yes.

1279
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:46,380
How do you not just allow yourself into the joy of following out with music?

1280
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,380
I don't know.

1281
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,380
You know?

1282
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:49,380
How could you not get pumped?

1283
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,420
How could you not even like at least sing a little bit along?

1284
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,100
He sounds bored and disinfected.

1285
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,100
It sucks.

1286
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,340
Probably because Alex would hear about it and he'd beat him up for working his side

1287
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,340
of the street.

1288
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,340
Sure.

1289
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,340
No.

1290
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,340
That's fair.

1291
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,340
That's my game.

1292
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,340
Yeah, but get a little into it.

1293
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,340
Get a little hips.

1294
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:05,340
Get your hips into it, man.

1295
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:08,740
If I worked at Infowars and I was hosting when Alex was gone or something like that,

1296
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:12,380
I would come in for a break with Silver Stally and I'd sing along.

1297
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,380
Non-stop.

1298
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,540
I'd just begging Alex to fire me.

1299
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:21,340
I would have callers call in and then be like, you're boring, and play a song and sing instead.

1300
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,340
It would be great.

1301
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,460
It would always be the highway.

1302
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,900
Everyone would go crazy.

1303
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:33,140
So we sensed a little bit of perhaps racial animus earlier from Harrison, his Black Lives

1304
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:36,300
Matter failures and what have you.

1305
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,300
Sure.

1306
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,180
You can see a little bit more of that on display here.

1307
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:46,340
If the Democrats are allowed to carry out this fraud, first of all, they'll do it again

1308
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:48,420
and again and again and again and again.

1309
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:56,020
They'll also increase the number of immigrants by magnitudes of 10, refugees by many, many

1310
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,020
millions.

1311
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,620
They'll completely open the borders outright.

1312
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:07,620
They'll install socialistic programs that reward people that don't work, don't provide,

1313
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,460
have nothing but hatred for us.

1314
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,780
I think I see Owen Schroyer there.

1315
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,620
Do you see him right there to the left of the stage?

1316
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,980
Screen left, stage right.

1317
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:19,420
Owen Schroyer just stood up and is looking around.

1318
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,420
That's him, right?

1319
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:24,480
I do think that moment is a little cute at the end because if you're watching the video,

1320
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,500
you can see almost real excitement when he sees Owen.

1321
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,500
Oh, look at Owen!

1322
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,500
Hey!

1323
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,020
I think that him and Owen might actually be friends.

1324
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,020
I think that sounds right.

1325
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:37,980
Because later on when Owen's on the phone and the two of them, I think, talk over each

1326
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:42,740
other or something, there's some kind of a weird thing, they both apologize to each other

1327
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:43,740
in a way.

1328
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:44,740
That's cute.

1329
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,740
Well, it's not so much that it's cute.

1330
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:46,740
It seems human.

1331
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:47,740
Yeah.

1332
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:48,740
It seems like how people would interact.

1333
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:49,740
I know.

1334
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:50,740
That's what I'm saying.

1335
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:53,120
Whereas it's cute that these automatons...

1336
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:56,020
Watching Alex interact with people, it's so goddamn rude all the time.

1337
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,620
He's got half a mouthful of sandwich.

1338
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,120
Yeah, exactly.

1339
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,900
It's bizarre to see actual excitement.

1340
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:06,420
See my friend on TV and then also polite conversation.

1341
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,420
It's bizarre.

1342
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,140
Oh my god, Owen's on The Price is Right.

1343
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,140
Owen's on The Price is Right, guys!

1344
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,140
Everybody get around!

1345
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,140
The standards are so low.

1346
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:21,220
Anyway, I'm a guy who's just shoveling a little pile of stuff that looks bad in hindsight.

1347
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,220
Sure, sure.

1348
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,220
Just gonna add to that.

1349
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,220
Digging that deeper.

1350
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,220
Just gonna add to that pile over here.

1351
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,220
Yep, okay.

1352
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,220
Whoop, what's this?

1353
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:28,220
Oh, it's a big one.

1354
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:36,620
So today is the day that the Congress will vote on whether or not to certify and codify

1355
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:42,620
the so-called fraudulent results of the election.

1356
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:50,860
There are many machinations that could be pulled out here in the last minutes or so,

1357
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:51,860
the last hours.

1358
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:56,580
And of course, it's not really over until January 20th, but today is the day that we've

1359
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,580
all been waiting for.

1360
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:03,020
It's the day that Donald Trump himself requested his supporters come to Washington DC to see

1361
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:08,360
him speak and to stand up against the lies, disinformation, and fraud of the mainstream

1362
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,540
media and their controllers in the deep state.

1363
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:13,540
Truly incredible stuff.

1364
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:19,140
Of course, the word is that Alex Jones was requested by Donald Trump himself to lead

1365
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,140
the march.

1366
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,140
Really driving that home.

1367
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,140
Oh boy.

1368
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:24,940
I mean, he only said it twice, though.

1369
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:27,980
I would have to hear it three times in order for it to be like, well, yeah, that would

1370
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:28,980
be a pattern.

1371
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,100
You know, once or twice is isolated incidents.

1372
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:37,300
In just a few minutes, Alex Jones will actually be leading the march to the Capitol at the

1373
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,620
behest, at the personal request of President Donald Trump.

1374
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:48,380
Alex Jones will be at the head of that vanguard as the entire crowd, this massive human snake,

1375
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:56,340
this huge, just unimaginable almost crowd of Trump supporters who have made their way

1376
01:00:56,340 --> 01:01:01,260
to the nation's Capitol, will wind its way towards the Capitol building.

1377
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,580
Oh, so they're going to the Capitol building.

1378
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,580
Wow.

1379
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:05,580
This all looks really bad.

1380
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:10,700
What a just glowing way to describe your friends and people you love.

1381
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,380
They look like a giant human snake.

1382
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:14,380
Yeah.

1383
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:20,300
So the mood is jovial among Trump supporters in D.C., or at least that's what Harrison

1384
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:24,740
is guessing, of course, based on his assessment of it from occupied Texas.

1385
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:25,740
Yeah.

1386
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:26,740
Come back, folks.

1387
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:29,500
The mood is still a jovial one here.

1388
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:34,540
And of course, as Rob Doo reported live on the scene there at the Save America March

1389
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:37,980
in Washington, D.C., it's like it's uplifting.

1390
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:38,980
Everybody's happy.

1391
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:39,980
Everybody's feeling good.

1392
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:46,820
But at the same time, there's an underlying aggressiveness beneath the surface and an

1393
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:53,900
unrest, I suppose you could say, pervading the spirit of American Trump supporters.

1394
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:59,620
Everybody's a little bit on edge because once again, we have tried and tried and tried and

1395
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,560
tried and tried to play within the rules.

1396
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,720
We have tried.

1397
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:11,100
To make the system change itself, to get back on track, to stop having endless drive to

1398
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,600
bankrupt and enslave us.

1399
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:20,020
And time and time again, we are met with traitorous and seditious acts blocking us from carrying

1400
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:27,060
out a legal, lawful within the bounds of the game changes.

1401
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:29,140
And now they've prevented us at every pass.

1402
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:33,460
Our last and final outlet was our sacred vote.

1403
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:38,060
And that is what has been stolen from us, or at least is still in the process of being

1404
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:39,400
stolen from us.

1405
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:45,500
So you're making the argument that the jovial mood is pierced only by the recognition that

1406
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:51,780
there are no more legal ways for you to deal with the problems that are existentially threatening

1407
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:53,260
to you.

1408
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,900
So you're saying that it's time to do illegal things.

1409
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:02,500
It is a solemn moment that we must decide to extrajudicially take back our republic.

1410
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:06,660
And it just so happens that that's exactly what we wanted to do, so we're feeling pretty

1411
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,780
good about it right now.

1412
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:12,060
It's a real jovial atmosphere, we're gonna kill a few people, it's gonna be great.

1413
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:16,660
There'll be some jaunty music playing in the background.

1414
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:21,520
We got a flapper contingent over there, they're doing a little...

1415
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:30,340
So earlier in the episode we already heard Harrison saying that we had the stolen.

1416
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:34,320
The Georgia election, the runoff was stolen.

1417
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:40,220
So this bit of news that he comes to at the end of his show seems almost unbelievable.

1418
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:49,660
Jack Pessobic reports that the Senate races in Georgia attracted 300,000 less votes than

1419
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:56,460
Donald Trump got for president, indicating that the base stayed home.

1420
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:02,020
Why would we go out of our way to support a party that refuses to lift a single finger

1421
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:28,140
for the president of the United States who we all voted for?

1422
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:32,900
These seem to be counter explanations for something.

1423
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:36,180
They almost seem at odds with one another.

1424
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:40,260
It almost seems that intentionally Infowars has self-contradictory narratives.

1425
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:41,620
Right, right, right, right.

1426
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:46,680
Perhaps even one would suggest that they don't even know what they believe is happening.

1427
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,820
Maybe they're very confused.

1428
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:50,620
Maybe they just report what feels good.

1429
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,860
It feels right that they stole it.

1430
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:53,860
Now obviously people didn't show up.

1431
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:57,200
It also feels right that people would punish the GOP for abandoning Trump.

1432
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,780
It makes sense that they wouldn't show up.

1433
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,660
Yeah, but also they stole it.

1434
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:01,660
They stole it.

1435
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:02,660
Yeah.

1436
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:06,460
Now, I mean, obviously it might have something to do with us saying that they stole elections

1437
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:10,420
and that elections don't matter, so your vote doesn't matter, so it doesn't matter if you

1438
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:11,420
vote.

1439
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,860
Ali Alexander's making a lot of money off the stuff that's stealing the vote.

1440
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:14,860
Exactly.

1441
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:15,860
We're getting a taste.

1442
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:16,860
I like it.

1443
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:17,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1444
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:22,180
So Harrison's hosting Alex's show, so it's basically just a smooth transition into the

1445
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,180
Alex Jones show.

1446
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:26,580
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Alex Jones show.

1447
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:27,580
I'm Harrison Smith.

1448
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:32,580
It's January 6th, and Donald Trump has just begun speaking to the Stop the Steal march

1449
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:33,580
in Washington.

1450
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:37,740
Without any further ado, we go now to the President of the United States in Washington.

1451
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,300
So I apologize in advance.

1452
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:43,980
The first hour of the show is just Trump's speech, and so we're going to have to listen

1453
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,020
to a little bit of it.

1454
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:49,540
I know that we generally don't listen to stuff, but this is pretty wild.

1455
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:50,540
Sure.

1456
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:56,060
I think that it also sets the stage for a lot of the content and the things that end

1457
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,060
up happening.

1458
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:58,560
I'll listen to his words.

1459
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,020
Please try not to scream too much.

1460
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:01,020
We're recording this late.

1461
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:02,260
I'm not screaming.

1462
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:10,860
So it kind of begins with Trump rambling a bit about how his crowds are really huge and

1463
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:11,860
fake news.

1464
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:12,860
Unsurprising.

1465
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,860
They never show the crowds, so they won't.

1466
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:15,860
Of course not.

1467
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:16,860
Go ahead.

1468
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:17,860
Turn your cameras, please.

1469
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:18,860
Would you show?

1470
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:26,380
They came from all over the world, actually, but they came from all over our country.

1471
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,140
I just really want to see what they do.

1472
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:30,860
I just want to see how they cover it.

1473
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:37,860
I've never seen anything like it, but it would be really great if we could be covered fairly

1474
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:38,860
by the media.

1475
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:41,860
The media is the biggest problem we have as far as I'm concerned.

1476
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,860
Single biggest problem.

1477
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:44,860
Wow.

1478
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:49,740
Oh, you're making whimpering dog noises.

1479
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:53,340
Oh, what a whimpering whiny- oh, no, the media's so mean.

1480
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:56,860
Well, if that seemed kind of soft, wait for this one.

1481
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:57,860
Okay.

1482
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:00,700
There's so many weak Republicans, and we have great ones.

1483
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:05,780
Jim Jordan and some of these guys, they're out there fighting, the House guys are fighting,

1484
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:07,460
but it's incredible.

1485
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,460
Many of the Republicans, I helped them get in.

1486
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,100
I helped them get elected.

1487
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,540
I helped Mitch get elected.

1488
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:20,580
I helped... I could name 24 of them, let's say.

1489
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:22,140
I won't bore you with it.

1490
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:24,180
What the fuck is going on?

1491
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:30,300
Even just now, this is so bizarre that this is what's happening, that this is the speech

1492
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,300
that he's giving.

1493
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:35,540
What a whiny... I never listened to him.

1494
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:36,540
It's so weak.

1495
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:42,140
I think this is something that is underreported amongst all of his terrifying words, is how

1496
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:45,020
much of a pathetic little whiny whiner he is.

1497
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,500
He's a whiner.

1498
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,500
He's a whiner.

1499
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,980
He's a little tiny whiner.

1500
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:54,100
You imagine anybody else in a leadership position complaining about, I could name 24 people

1501
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,980
I've helped who are ungrateful to me.

1502
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:59,100
Oh my God.

1503
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,100
Grow up.

1504
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,460
I wouldn't respect that in a boss.

1505
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:07,460
I wouldn't respect that in a contemporary.

1506
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:10,660
I wouldn't respect that in anybody who's in elected office.

1507
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:13,380
That is childish shit.

1508
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:21,380
Can you imagine Obama... They made fun of my tan suit.

1509
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:23,700
Everybody's so mean to me.

1510
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:27,820
I helped all these Democrats get elected and they have abandoned me in my time of need

1511
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:30,780
when I need people to stand up for my tan suit.

1512
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:33,500
God, it's just pathetic.

1513
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,060
This is so sad.

1514
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:39,660
Anyway, it's been a while since I've heard a president swear.

1515
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:42,140
And Trump says bullshit in the middle of this clip.

1516
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:43,140
And then the audio-

1517
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,140
Well, you weren't alive for Nixon.

1518
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:45,140
Well, that's true.

1519
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:47,140
I've heard some tapes.

1520
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:53,500
I don't know if Nixon ever swore and then a crowd of people started chanting the swear

1521
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,500
he just said.

1522
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,500
Yes, come on, do it.

1523
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:02,180
This year, using the pretext of the China virus and the scam of mail-in ballots, Democrats

1524
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:07,620
attempted the most brazen and outrageous election theft, and there's never been anything like

1525
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:10,620
this, so pure theft in American history.

1526
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:11,620
Everybody knows it.

1527
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:12,620
Everybody knows it.

1528
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:15,780
That election, our election, was over at 10 o'clock in the evening.

1529
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:22,180
We're leading Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, by hundreds of thousands of votes.

1530
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:23,180
I don't understand things.

1531
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:29,720
And then late in the evening or early in the morning, boom, these explosions of bullshit.

1532
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:40,540
And all of a sudden, all of a sudden, it started to happen.

1533
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,000
That's amazing.

1534
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Do you know why?

1535
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,240
Do you know why all of this shit?

1536
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,480
Do you know?

1537
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,480
Here's what I'll say.

1538
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,960
I will say this.

1539
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,960
This is what I believe.

1540
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,660
As much as the cops are totally complicit with all those people getting through and

1541
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:02,180
all that shit, the reason that the National Guard and all of those people weren't already

1542
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:05,660
at the ready is because of shit like this.

1543
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,940
This is professional wrestling.

1544
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:13,980
None of these people thought that any of this was real.

1545
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:19,020
You're telling me that a crowd of people who's listening to the President of the United States,

1546
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:24,060
a goddamn, the biggest economy in the world, a nuclear fucking power, is going to get taken

1547
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:29,220
down by a crowd of assholes screaming, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

1548
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:30,220
It's perfect.

1549
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:31,220
Yes.

1550
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,220
Yes.

1551
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,220
Yes.

1552
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:34,220
Yes.

1553
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,220
Yes.

1554
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,220
Yes.

1555
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:37,220
It's the same shit.

1556
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:38,220
It's weird.

1557
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:39,220
It's pathetic.

1558
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:40,220
Yeah.

1559
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:42,340
There are definite elements of overlap.

1560
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:45,900
And when you're losing in a wrestling match, you got to fight harder.

1561
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:48,120
And that's what Trump says people got to do.

1562
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:52,760
This is keep in mind right before people stormed the Capitol.

1563
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:55,880
And we want to be so nice.

1564
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:01,820
We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people.

1565
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:04,700
And we're going to have to fight much harder.

1566
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,580
And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us.

1567
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:16,660
And if he doesn't, that will be a sad day for our country because you're sworn to uphold

1568
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:20,540
our Constitution.

1569
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:26,500
Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy.

1570
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:31,340
Donald Trump giving it to Republicans and Democrats alike in defense of the Constitution.

1571
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,020
We have to go to a quick commercial break.

1572
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:34,020
It's the Alex Jones show.

1573
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,020
We'll be right back.

1574
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:38,820
So now it's up to Pence to save the Constitution, which I guess he didn't do.

1575
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:39,820
Oh, no.

1576
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:41,740
So the audience kind of took the message.

1577
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:42,740
Yeah.

1578
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:45,860
Seemed very one to one.

1579
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:46,860
Seemed very if-then.

1580
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:52,100
It's, again, narrative consistency.

1581
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:56,780
It's kind of interesting how the night before, Owen was trying out a little bit of standup.

1582
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,780
Yeah, he was doing a bit.

1583
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:58,780
Yeah.

1584
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:01,220
And I noticed that Trump might have the standup itch too.

1585
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,220
He's got a bit.

1586
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,220
He's got a little bit.

1587
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:04,220
All right.

1588
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:09,420
And the only unhappy person in the United States, single most unhappy, is Hillary Clinton

1589
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:13,380
because she said, why didn't you do this for me four years ago?

1590
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:16,660
Why didn't you do this for me four years ago?

1591
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:20,220
You changed the votes, 10,000 in Michigan.

1592
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:23,740
You could have changed the whole thing, but she's not too happy.

1593
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:25,580
You don't see her anymore.

1594
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:26,580
What happened?

1595
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:27,580
Where's Hillary?

1596
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:28,580
Where is she?

1597
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,580
That bit did not land.

1598
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:32,940
You would have expected that bit to go over gangbusters in that crowd, but no.

1599
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:39,020
I think the problem with that bit is that he unfortunately undid his entire bullshit

1600
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:40,860
for this election.

1601
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,220
Yeah.

1602
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:43,820
Why didn't they do it for her?

1603
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:44,820
Yeah.

1604
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:47,700
It's a comedic premise as much as it is a plot hole.

1605
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:48,700
Yeah.

1606
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:49,700
Exactly.

1607
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,700
Yeah.

1608
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,700
Yeah.

1609
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:52,700
Huh.

1610
01:12:52,700 --> 01:13:03,700
Oh, why didn't those gunners on the destroyer shoot down the escape pod with C-3PO and R2D2

1611
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:04,700
on it?

1612
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:05,700
Good bit.

1613
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:06,700
I don't know.

1614
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:07,700
I don't know.

1615
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:08,700
Hilarious.

1616
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:09,700
Hilarious.

1617
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:12,380
So this is where things fall apart.

1618
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:17,100
He wants to try and prove that there was fraud.

1619
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,100
Sure.

1620
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,100
Let's hear it.

1621
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,100
It was rough.

1622
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,100
Okay.

1623
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:24,980
As you know, the media has constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was no evidence

1624
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:25,980
of widespread fraud.

1625
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:26,980
You ever see these people?

1626
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:27,980
You ever see these people?

1627
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:28,980
Well, there's no evidence of fraud.

1628
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:29,980
Oh, really?

1629
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,980
Well, I'm going to read you pages.

1630
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:34,300
I hope you don't get bored listening to it.

1631
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,300
Promise.

1632
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,500
Don't get bored listening to it.

1633
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,780
All those hundreds of thousands of people back there.

1634
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:42,340
Move them up, please.

1635
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:45,660
All these people, don't get bored.

1636
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:48,580
Don't get angry at me because you're going to get bored.

1637
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:49,860
Because it's so much.

1638
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:50,860
They do get bored.

1639
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:51,860
Yeah.

1640
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:52,860
He just starts rattling off numbers.

1641
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:53,860
That'll happen.

1642
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:54,860
And stuff.

1643
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,140
And the audience, I don't think, is able to pay attention.

1644
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,340
It's not exciting.

1645
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:00,060
He loses them a little bit.

1646
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:07,160
In retrospect, if all of these speakers had known that the crowd was more of a stormin'

1647
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:10,100
crowd than a chantin' crowd, you know?

1648
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:11,820
Like they like chantin' for sure.

1649
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:12,820
But they love stormin'.

1650
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:13,820
Well, we learned that.

1651
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:17,540
I don't think the numbers game was really going to inspire them in the speeches department.

1652
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,780
You kind of needed like a three quarters Alex.

1653
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:20,780
Yeah, totally.

1654
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:21,780
That's about where you want him to be.

1655
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:22,780
Yeah.

1656
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,140
You'll burn out too fast with a full Alex.

1657
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:25,140
Totally.

1658
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:27,780
But that same kind of energy, just a little bit lower.

1659
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:30,540
And if you get stuck in the weeds, you're not coming back out.

1660
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,540
No.

1661
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:32,540
Nope.

1662
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:33,540
Start talking about COVID shit.

1663
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:34,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1664
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:35,540
You're fucked.

1665
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,540
One out of every ten people.

1666
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:37,540
We already stopped listening, buddy.

1667
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,540
Start listing off counties.

1668
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:39,540
Yeah, exactly.

1669
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:40,540
Oh, yeah, don't.

1670
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:41,540
Get the fuck out of here.

1671
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:45,540
The only way to save that is you got to start complaining about Twitter.

1672
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:51,180
Every time I put out a tweet, even if it's totally correct, totally correct, I get a

1673
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:52,180
flag.

1674
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:53,180
It gets flagged.

1675
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:54,180
I get a flag.

1676
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:56,500
And they also don't let you get out.

1677
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:00,160
You know, on Twitter, it's very hard to come onto my account.

1678
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,620
It's very hard to get out a message.

1679
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:06,180
They don't let the message get out nearly like they should.

1680
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:09,060
But I've had many people say, I can't get on your Twitter.

1681
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:10,580
I don't care about Twitter.

1682
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:11,580
Twitter's bad news.

1683
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,180
They're all bad news.

1684
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,300
Twitter's bad news.

1685
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,860
Twitter's bad news.

1686
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:17,460
Oh, man.

1687
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:22,620
How funny is it how long everybody has tried to respect the office of the president?

1688
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,620
Yeah.

1689
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,300
How hilarious is it?

1690
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:30,040
This might have all ended if TV news anchors just treated Trump the way I did.

1691
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:34,200
And every time he whined, just went, oh, no, you're so sad.

1692
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,820
And then everybody was done.

1693
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:36,820
Maybe.

1694
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:37,820
Yeah.

1695
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:42,580
I mean, look, I know that generally we don't cover when, you know, Trump's speeches.

1696
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:46,460
But often they don't play these full speeches on Info Wars.

1697
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:47,460
Of course not.

1698
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:51,740
And I had to listen to this.

1699
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:52,740
I'm sorry.

1700
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:53,740
So that's why we're...

1701
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:56,220
That's why I have to listen.

1702
01:15:56,220 --> 01:16:00,460
And because there are things in it that are like, really, if you're listening in the audience,

1703
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:04,980
you kind of get a certain message, and that is that Pence has got to seize power.

1704
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:05,980
That's our only option.

1705
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:06,980
Yeah, 100%.

1706
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:09,700
And it's time that somebody did something about it.

1707
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:15,460
And Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for

1708
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:17,680
the good of our country.

1709
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:23,300
And if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you, I will tell you right now.

1710
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:24,860
I'm not hearing good stories.

1711
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:26,940
He's not hearing good stories.

1712
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:30,000
So I mean, that's pretty clear, but it's even clearer here.

1713
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,700
The Republicans have to get tougher.

1714
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:34,960
You're not going to have a Republican Party if you don't get tougher.

1715
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,460
They want to play so straight, they want to play so...

1716
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,580
Sir, yes, the United States.

1717
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:43,420
The Constitution doesn't allow me to send them back to the States.

1718
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:45,420
Well, I say, yes, it does.

1719
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:49,060
Because the Constitution says you have to protect our country, and you have to protect

1720
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:52,460
our Constitution, and you can't vote on fraud.

1721
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:54,800
And fraud breaks up everything, doesn't it?

1722
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,500
When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very different rules.

1723
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,500
I should know.

1724
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,500
I've cheated on my wife.

1725
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:05,100
And I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do.

1726
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:09,220
And I hope he doesn't listen to the rhinos and the stupid people that he's listening

1727
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,220
to.

1728
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:14,740
You know, whenever you have the president up there saying that Pence is the last chance

1729
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:19,940
to really save this and save the Constitution, he has a responsibility to do it, then Pence

1730
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:22,000
doesn't do that thing.

1731
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,840
And the president has also said that when something is stolen, you're playing by a different

1732
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,160
set of rules.

1733
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:32,780
It's kind of hard to not take away a message of, like, there's no rules.

1734
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:35,620
The rules that are normal are gone.

1735
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:42,060
I do find it difficult to take a would-be strongman dictator seriously if he gives an

1736
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:45,660
entire speech exhorting his second in command.

1737
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:51,780
What is a borderline honorary position?

1738
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:54,300
It's to overthrow the country for him.

1739
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:55,580
That's a little bit sad.

1740
01:17:55,580 --> 01:18:00,020
Mixed in with petty complaints about people being rude to him.

1741
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:01,020
Real tough.

1742
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:02,020
And Twitter traction.

1743
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:04,140
Real tough to be terrified of this.

1744
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:08,060
But that's kind of the thing, though.

1745
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:13,140
That could easily be what blinds you to the real danger of a lot of things.

1746
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:19,700
And it's easy to minimize what some real threats are because of that window dressing of, like,

1747
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:20,700
isn't this pathetic?

1748
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,700
Yeah, sure.

1749
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:22,700
And shit.

1750
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:23,700
Obviously.

1751
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:24,700
Of course.

1752
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,820
So, we're done with Trump's speech now.

1753
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:31,620
That was the most of it that is relevant, because Harrison comes back and he wants to

1754
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:36,900
throw it to a video of what's going on in Congress, where Mike Pence is presiding over

1755
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:37,900
this.

1756
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:42,700
But they actually send it to the streets, where Alex is bullhorning.

1757
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:47,340
Let's go to inside the chamber here.

1758
01:18:47,340 --> 01:19:03,540
The report is...

1759
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:05,160
So what does that mean?

1760
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,020
It doesn't have a good rhythm.

1761
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:08,020
It doesn't have a good meter.

1762
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:09,020
No, it doesn't.

1763
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,340
As far as the chant goes.

1764
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:13,100
But also, again, he's chanting 1776.

1765
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:17,460
I don't know what message you're supposed to take away from that other than overthrow

1766
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:18,460
the government.

1767
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:20,620
What happened in 1776 that he would be referencing?

1768
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:23,180
I mean, there's that revolution...

1769
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,700
Did anything else happen, though?

1770
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,700
I mean, I'm certain.

1771
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:29,660
I'm certain there were things that history has not recorded that happened.

1772
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:30,660
Let's see.

1773
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:31,660
Did, uh...

1774
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:32,660
Probably someone opened a business.

1775
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:38,180
Yeah, I would say that I think Benjamin Franklin opened up a little side gig grinding lenses.

1776
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,700
I think that's also what happened in 1776.

1777
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:46,980
I guarantee there was somebody in, like, Virginia who was also like, everybody cool out!

1778
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:48,540
He's not referencing that.

1779
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:49,540
1776!

1780
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:54,060
The year Sam made his first beers!

1781
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,300
Sam Adams!

1782
01:19:55,300 --> 01:20:00,940
Somebody in Virginia was trying to get people to have rationality, and calmer heads will

1783
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:01,940
prevail!

1784
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:02,940
Yeah!

1785
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:03,940
That's not what he's referring to.

1786
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:05,180
He's talking about overthrowing the government.

1787
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:08,840
I think a diplomatic solution is in order!

1788
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:14,460
So Alex still is not, like, great with long stretches, he'll still end up becoming really

1789
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,460
overwhelmed by...

1790
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:16,460
I mean, it's tough.

1791
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:17,460
You gotta yell into a bullhorn.

1792
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:18,460
Bullhorning is hard.

1793
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,460
So Owen's gotta come in here and there.

1794
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:21,460
Sure.

1795
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:28,460
The Democrats have gone so insane that they're now making the words mother and father illegal

1796
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:29,460
in legislative bodies!

1797
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:30,460
Have you heard this?

1798
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,460
Nancy Pelosi has proposed that the words mother and father are illegal.

1799
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,460
So I got news for Nancy Pelosi!

1800
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:43,100
Donald Trump is your daddy!

1801
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:44,100
Too good.

1802
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,100
Do twice.

1803
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,100
Oh boy.

1804
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,100
Yeah.

1805
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:48,100
He's into that bit.

1806
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,100
Oh man.

1807
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,100
Yup.

1808
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:54,540
So when I was listening to this action of Alex and Owen on the street, it really felt

1809
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:57,460
like they were trying to juice this crowd up.

1810
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,700
It feels kind of like incitement.

1811
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:06,940
Ladies and gentlemen, Trump said in his speech today, he said the Democrats are out to get

1812
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:07,940
us.

1813
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:08,940
They want to destroy us!

1814
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:09,940
They want for the globalist!

1815
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:10,940
They want to bring America down!

1816
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:11,940
But we're not going to let them do it!

1817
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:12,940
This news system is a military high-tech attack, and we need to understand we're under attack,

1818
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:13,940
and we need to understand this is 21st century warfare, and get on the road.

1819
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:14,940
We need to get on the road.

1820
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:15,940
We need to get on the road.

1821
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:16,940
We need to get on the road.

1822
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:17,940
We need to get on the road.

1823
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:37,100
And not just take this country back, but take the whole world back from the communist Chinese!

1824
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:41,420
So I mean, it seems like if you're in the audience, you're probably, this is the kind

1825
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:47,580
of thing that would be like, what you then yell, rawr, and then you charge, you know?

1826
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:51,540
How should I take the country back?

1827
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:53,180
You're not giving me answers.

1828
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,300
I'm not getting concrete answers from you.

1829
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:56,300
Supplements.

1830
01:21:56,300 --> 01:22:00,980
There's actually a way to take the country back in front of me, so I'm going to go do

1831
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:01,980
that.

1832
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:02,980
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1833
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:03,980
You need to spread my links.

1834
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:04,980
No, no, no, no.

1835
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:06,660
See, you said take the country back.

1836
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,860
Right, by spreading links to Band.video and buying supplements.

1837
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:10,980
I left my phone in the car.

1838
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:13,140
I guess I'll overthrow the government.

1839
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:14,140
Just take a walk.

1840
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:17,620
When you get back to the car, you'll be able to, just be cool.

1841
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:20,260
But I want one of those pictures off that fucking wall, man.

1842
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:21,260
Listen to me.

1843
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:22,260
Listen to me.

1844
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:24,060
I went on a tour the other day, and there's this picture.

1845
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:26,180
No, it's on the Capitol building wall.

1846
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:30,100
Stopping the Chinese can only be achieved by more traffic coming to my website.

1847
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:32,100
I don't think you understand.

1848
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:35,900
We're at cross purposes!

1849
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:39,980
We have different ideas of what 1776 looks like.

1850
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:43,740
In your 1776, you get rich!

1851
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:46,140
I feel like that's different than mine!

1852
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:49,180
You're trying to profiteer.

1853
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:51,900
So Owen, I'm sorry, not Owen.

1854
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:58,540
Harrison has been pretty clear that allegedly, alleged, Donald Trump has personally asked

1855
01:22:58,540 --> 01:22:59,780
Alex to lead this march.

1856
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:00,780
It's possible.

1857
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:07,140
Now that's weird because while they're showing Alex, you can overhear a producer tell Alex

1858
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:12,540
that Trump told the audience at his speech that they were going to march down Pennsylvania,

1859
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:15,180
which Alex should know, because he's supposed to be leading that march.

1860
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:16,180
He was led, yeah.

1861
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:17,180
President's going to finish.

1862
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:22,620
President's going to finish in ten minutes, and he just told the crowd, let's walk down

1863
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:23,620
Pennsylvania.

1864
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:24,620
Is this Pennsylvania?

1865
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:27,480
Right, folks, this is a live feed from Washington, D.C.

1866
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:31,580
Right now, Alex Jones and Owen Schroer speaking to a large crowd.

1867
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:37,180
That exchange doesn't make much sense if Trump has asked Alex to, but whatever.

1868
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:38,180
I don't care.

1869
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:41,020
Trump is going down Pennsylvania Avenue.

1870
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:42,020
Where am I?

1871
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:43,020
Is this Pennsylvania?

1872
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,020
Am I in D.C.?

1873
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:45,020
Where am I?

1874
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,020
Pennsylvania's a state.

1875
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:51,300
That's a long walk from here.

1876
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:55,700
So here is where we get our first mention of the breaching of barriers.

1877
01:23:55,700 --> 01:24:00,060
And I think it's really interesting because these people have started to encroach over

1878
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:07,440
the line, and at the same time, you have audio of Alex yelling about the New World Order.

1879
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:12,320
On the broadcast that Harrison is trying to put together, you have really an interesting

1880
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,260
juxtaposition of these two things.

1881
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:17,780
Mike Pence has rejected Trump's call.

1882
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:23,820
He has failed to show the courage that Donald Trump was attempting to imbue in him and has

1883
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:27,060
begun the counting of the electoral votes.

1884
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:34,940
At the same time, there's word that thousands of patriots have broken through the barriers

1885
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:39,580
around the Capitol and are now moving towards it to occupy this word from Elijah Shaffer,

1886
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:41,260
who's on the ground.

1887
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:43,620
And Alex Jones continues to speak to this crowd.

1888
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,620
Let's go back to Alex Jones.

1889
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:54,380
And the great awakening, the great reset is triggering the great awakening and the great

1890
01:24:54,380 --> 01:25:02,860
awakening will trigger the great rebellion and the destruction of the New World Order.

1891
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:04,940
Looks bad in hindsight.

1892
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:06,580
A lot of this looks real bad.

1893
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:10,820
I just, I'm starting to see a pattern.

1894
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:13,100
The word, it's thematic consistency.

1895
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:19,260
Yeah, you know, a lot of the times I think the word incitement is overused.

1896
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:22,020
You know, it's a very specific meaning.

1897
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:23,940
This is that specific meaning.

1898
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:31,340
Yeah, it's interesting because this group does, like that Alex is leading, are not the

1899
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:36,820
same people that Harrison is talking about breaching these barriers.

1900
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:41,140
But at the same time, Alex's group is going to go to the Capitol.

1901
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:42,740
They're heading to the Capitol.

1902
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:46,700
So some of the people that are in Alex's group may have gotten involved.

1903
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:47,700
We'll have to.

1904
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:51,980
I don't know, but I mean, they would hope for the time being, these are two separate

1905
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:56,640
things that are happening are a hundred percent in sync.

1906
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:01,220
And to the extent that like a lot of those people who are the first ones that were pictured

1907
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:06,340
inside the Capitol building were QAnon weirdos, Alex is talking about the Great Awakening,

1908
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:11,540
which is such a trademark of the Q followers.

1909
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:16,060
Something that is basically their brand.

1910
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:17,960
And it's just, it's a lot.

1911
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,100
It's a lot.

1912
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:27,060
But I will say, in Alex's credit, maybe not in Alex's credit, he's very insistent to make

1913
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:31,460
sure people hear him say we're not politically nonviolent, nonviolent.

1914
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:32,460
Yeah.

1915
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:38,420
Upwards of, as we say, estimated a million people moving to surround the Capitol.

1916
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:42,700
Owen Troyer and Alex Jones now speaking through the bullhorn to the crowds who follow them.

1917
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:43,700
You stabbed us in the back one too many times.

1918
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:44,700
Coming with truth and justice and non-violent civil disobedience.

1919
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,700
Good to get that on the record.

1920
01:26:46,700 --> 01:27:04,500
No, there's, I think just after that you can hear someone say, you tell them Alex.

1921
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:08,820
I think a producer also was in his ear there saying, hey, they were, they're actually doing

1922
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:09,820
it.

1923
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:14,940
So, uh, I don't know how much Alex would be aware of at this point because you know, communication

1924
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:19,380
would be difficult with that many people in a, such a tight space.

1925
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:20,380
Totally.

1926
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:21,380
Communication could be tough.

1927
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:25,020
I know that Alex does have quite a security detail that probably have walkie talkies and

1928
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:26,020
private bands.

1929
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:27,020
Yeah.

1930
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:31,820
So there is a chance that, and actually spoiler alert, I know that he has somebody who's inside.

1931
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:32,820
Yeah.

1932
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:38,580
So like, I know that like he, I have a hard time believing he doesn't know more than it

1933
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:39,580
appears.

1934
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:40,580
Sure.

1935
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:41,780
But also I don't know if he knows the full scope of things.

1936
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:42,780
Right.

1937
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:43,780
Right.

1938
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:44,780
Right.

1939
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:47,180
I think it would be strange that he would be very insistent on being like, we're coming

1940
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,180
with nonviolent.

1941
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,180
All right.

1942
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:50,180
Yeah.

1943
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,180
That seems a little bit telling.

1944
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:52,180
But it also seems on brand for him.

1945
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:56,780
I could believe like, cause he'd always says like politically, I want to kill you politically.

1946
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:57,780
Yeah.

1947
01:27:57,780 --> 01:27:58,780
Yeah.

1948
01:27:58,780 --> 01:27:59,780
So it's hard to say.

1949
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:04,740
Uh, they also, uh, you know, just getting people riled up while they walk.

1950
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:05,740
It's fun.

1951
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:06,740
We're never surrendering!

1952
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:07,740
Until tomorrow.

1953
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:08,740
This is our country!

1954
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:09,740
This is our country!

1955
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:10,740
Not our corrupt politician's country!

1956
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:19,740
They work for us and it's time they got our family to remind us who their boss is!

1957
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:27,740
The communist Chinese and the globalist and Hollywood don't run this country and our children

1958
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:30,740
do not belong in their pedophile trash!

1959
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:37,740
We will not accept the fake election of that child molesting Joe Biden, that Chinese communist

1960
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:38,740
agent Joe Biden!

1961
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:42,260
We know where he belongs and it's not the White House!

1962
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:46,380
So something I think is really interesting about their dynamic, their tag team dynamic,

1963
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:51,380
is like, they kind of have to do this because Alex doesn't have the cardio to walk and carry

1964
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:57,280
on sentences and simultaneously Owen doesn't have the creativity to speak more than like

1965
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,280
in little bursts.

1966
01:28:58,280 --> 01:28:59,280
Yeah.

1967
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,280
Yeah.

1968
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:01,280
Yeah.

1969
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,280
So the two of them kind of need each other as crutches.

1970
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,280
Yeah.

1971
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:04,280
They're doing a good little two man game here.

1972
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,280
I think of it as like a three legged race.

1973
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,280
Yeah.

1974
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:11,700
Well, it's no Siskel and Ebert teamwork level of complimentary parts here.

1975
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:12,700
No.

1976
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:16,020
Or some like good trading verses and some hip hop songs you might hear.

1977
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:17,020
It's not that.

1978
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:18,020
It's not fluid.

1979
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,020
This is not definition.

1980
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,020
No.

1981
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:23,780
No, no Mos Def and Talib Kweli to be found here.

1982
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:28,940
No, but it's the same thing in terms of like they need each other in order to make this

1983
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:29,940
work.

1984
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:30,940
Yeah.

1985
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:31,940
It's blah.

1986
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:32,940
Sad.

1987
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:36,100
So Harrison's back in the studio and he has some other things to report, primarily he's

1988
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:41,700
getting word that staffers are evacuating from these Capitol buildings.

1989
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:46,180
Siskel is addressing the house right now, but here is an update as of less than a minute

1990
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:50,820
ago Hill staffers have been told to evacuate the Madison building.

1991
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:55,340
Things are getting tenuous here as Trump supporters and Patriots continue to pour towards

1992
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:56,340
the Capitol.

1993
01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:00,860
Alex Jones himself at the head of a massive column of Patriots moving now towards the

1994
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:03,060
United States Capitol building.

1995
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:08,220
This again looks bad.

1996
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:12,860
The government is fleeing Alex Jones is at the head of the rebellion.

1997
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:17,900
Well, they're going to enjoin the rebellion that is already in progress.

1998
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:21,900
They're the reinforcement column that's coming in.

1999
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:25,420
Alex Jones is flanking the fucking Capitol building.

2000
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:30,800
And to a certain extent, I kind of think that the reason that it's being presented like

2001
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,460
this is they still think this is going to stop.

2002
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:34,460
Yeah, no, of course.

2003
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:37,820
They still think they're not going to get inside.

2004
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:40,180
Everybody thinks that someone will stop these people.

2005
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:41,180
Yeah.

2006
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:42,180
Yeah.

2007
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:47,180
But because there's still this like, eh, kind of vibe, this is all very positive.

2008
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:53,740
This is a historic day, ladies and gentlemen, incredible things happening there storming

2009
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:58,300
DC Patriots are rushing and surrounding the Capitol.

2010
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:00,060
They're tearing down barriers.

2011
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:06,020
Police are struggling to maintain the crowd mace and punches being thrown back and forth

2012
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:09,920
to two house buildings have been evacuated.

2013
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:14,700
The House Cannon building in the House Madison building have both been issued evacuation

2014
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:15,700
orders.

2015
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:21,540
Pence has said he cannot reject out electoral votes outright, but the Congress themselves

2016
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:25,100
are objecting right now to the Arizona votes.

2017
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:26,340
The vibe is really positive.

2018
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:31,060
You know, this is, this is someone who's like really pumped to see what's happening.

2019
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:32,420
Yeah, this is great.

2020
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:33,780
This will never go wrong.

2021
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:34,780
Yeah.

2022
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:37,960
And I know that now there are a lot of people who are trying to make arguments that this

2023
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:38,960
was Antifa.

2024
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:39,960
Uh, certainly.

2025
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:42,660
Oh, it was just so super Antifa.

2026
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:43,660
Yeah.

2027
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:49,220
There's a lot of folks who have been on that tip, but immediately as everything is unfolding,

2028
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:52,640
Harrison wants you to know that this is not, these are the Patriots.

2029
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,020
This is not black lives matter folks.

2030
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:55,460
This is not Antifa.

2031
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:59,580
These are Patriots and perhaps they finally boiled over.

2032
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:06,500
You see the air filled with the mist of mace, the stinging gas that the police will be implementing

2033
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:10,420
and that is also being implemented against the police as Patriots.

2034
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:11,420
Wow.

2035
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:15,920
So, I mean, he's being very clear that, and if you watch the video, there are people who

2036
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,740
are macing cops, which is, you know, that's violence.

2037
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:19,740
Yeah.

2038
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:20,740
So yeah.

2039
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:21,740
Check that just for later.

2040
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:22,740
Totally.

2041
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:23,740
Um, yeah, he's very clear.

2042
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:24,740
This is not, this is us.

2043
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:25,740
This is our guys.

2044
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:26,740
We take responsibility.

2045
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:30,180
They finally had enough.

2046
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:31,180
He's celebrating all that.

2047
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:32,180
Of course he is.

2048
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:33,180
There's a celebratory vibe.

2049
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:34,180
Of course it is.

2050
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:40,660
American nationalists on Twitter, uh, asking president Trump to storm the Senate chamber.

2051
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:46,060
This day is young folks and who knows what will be, uh, what the, what the future holds

2052
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:47,060
for us.

2053
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:50,500
Again, Elijah Shaffer reports Patriots have stormed the Capitol building ground and are

2054
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:53,180
breaching federal barriers and police en masse.

2055
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:54,180
Yeah.

2056
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:55,180
That's what this day will bring.

2057
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:56,580
Maybe exactly what you're talking about.

2058
01:32:56,580 --> 01:33:01,060
Could be exactly what you're saying is what you want to happen might happen.

2059
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:02,060
Yeah.

2060
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:05,100
And he's pretty consistently calling these people Patriots.

2061
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,100
Sure.

2062
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:09,740
Thousands, hundreds of thousands of people right now moving towards the Capitol.

2063
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:15,740
The mass of humanity continues to grow as the police lash out their thin line of armored

2064
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:22,280
officers, a pitiful resistance against the literal tidal wave moving towards them.

2065
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:25,100
There's a pitiful resistance against these Patriots.

2066
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,100
They're so strong.

2067
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:27,100
Now.

2068
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:28,100
Yes.

2069
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:31,180
This is Harrison reporting on what he's seeing, right?

2070
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:34,020
Because he has access to a lot of different information.

2071
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:35,020
Yeah.

2072
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:36,020
Yeah.

2073
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:37,020
Yeah.

2074
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:38,020
Alex may or may not.

2075
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:42,820
So now we go to Alex on the street where everyone is chanting, fight for Trump.

2076
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:43,820
Cool.

2077
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:55,220
Chance of fight for Trump surrounding Alex Jones and Owen Troyer and the rest of the

2078
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:59,660
info Wars crew as they move towards the Capitol here, we see a view from inside the Capitol

2079
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:00,660
of staffers.

2080
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:04,420
They're moving down the stairs, following that evacuation order.

2081
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:09,180
You can't not see this as like two things that are about to intersect.

2082
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:10,180
Sure.

2083
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:13,940
A group of people who are fighting for Trump and a group of people that are being led by

2084
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:16,940
Alex who are chanting, fight for Trump.

2085
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:17,940
Right.

2086
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:18,940
Seems to be.

2087
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:19,940
Yes.

2088
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:20,940
Yes.

2089
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:21,940
Yeah.

2090
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:22,940
Yeah.

2091
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:23,940
Yeah.

2092
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:24,940
It's weird.

2093
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:25,940
It's very weird.

2094
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:26,940
Yeah.

2095
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:27,940
I would.

2096
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:28,940
Thematic consistency.

2097
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:29,940
I would want this back.

2098
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:30,940
Mulligan.

2099
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:33,860
I would like a mulligan on today.

2100
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:35,300
I don't think they can get that.

2101
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:40,140
This show looks bad.

2102
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:43,980
It's one part because Harrison Smith is hosting and he's terrible, but another part because

2103
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:48,820
like, I mean, you could draw your own conclusions.

2104
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:54,980
I don't, I don't think that like it would be wise or even sensible to say that like

2105
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:59,620
Alex inspired a lot of these actions because I mean, like we already said, a lot of the

2106
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:03,820
people who are the first photographed folks who were there, who had gotten in were Q folks

2107
01:35:03,820 --> 01:35:05,180
and they hate Alex.

2108
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:09,220
It's easy to, if you don't have an awareness of those worlds to think like, Oh, it's all

2109
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:10,220
the same.

2110
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:11,220
Right.

2111
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:12,220
It is not.

2112
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:13,220
Those people do not listen to Alex.

2113
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:14,220
Right.

2114
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:17,240
There are similar information spheres in terms of a lot of the themes and the narratives

2115
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:21,740
and the stories that they tell and the reality that they believe in, but they are not the

2116
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:23,180
same group.

2117
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:29,700
Now at the same time, Past Info Wars guests like Nick Fuentes and Baked Alaska were both

2118
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:36,140
in the offices, live streaming, and that's a little bit fucked up.

2119
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:37,140
They're Antifa.

2120
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:38,140
Did you know that?

2121
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:44,100
They are deep state secret Antifa agents that this entire time have been inspired.

2122
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:48,780
Not just, see the problem was they wanted deep state Antifa agents to inspire right

2123
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:49,780
wing violence.

2124
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:50,780
Sure.

2125
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:51,780
Right?

2126
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:52,780
But there wasn't any right wing violence, Dan.

2127
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:53,780
Oh, I see.

2128
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:56,860
They would never existed, so they had to create it from the ground up.

2129
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:58,060
I've got a conspiracy for you.

2130
01:35:58,060 --> 01:35:59,060
What's that?

2131
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:00,060
Where do you live?

2132
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:01,060
I live down the way.

2133
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:02,060
What city?

2134
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:03,060
Chicago.

2135
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:04,060
What city is Nick Fuentes living?

2136
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,060
Chicago?

2137
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:06,060
Uh oh.

2138
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:07,060
No way.

2139
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:08,060
You're Nick Fuentes.

2140
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:09,060
Stop yelling.

2141
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:10,060
Stop yelling.

2142
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:11,060
Sorry.

2143
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:12,060
That's alright.

2144
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:13,060
That deserved a yell.

2145
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:14,060
Okay.

2146
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:18,940
So this all just looks, it all looks really, really bad.

2147
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:25,340
And especially thinking about the people who are, you know, it's sometimes tough for people

2148
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:30,620
to get over their frustration with elected officials and feel too much empathy for them.

2149
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:34,860
But then you think about people who are just staffers and people who are just on the job

2150
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:38,100
and the terror that a lot of them probably felt.

2151
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:45,140
Being whisked away to secure locations, I can't even imagine what that would be like.

2152
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:49,860
And it's really fucked up to know that that is what a lot of people are experiencing.

2153
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:53,980
And for this just to be like, they're kind of relishing it.

2154
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:56,700
And Harrison is as well on air.

2155
01:36:56,700 --> 01:37:04,620
Now in the least unexpected thing ever, Trump is not going to the Capitol.

2156
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:09,260
After he said, we're all going to the Capitol, they're all going to the Capitol, huge, almost

2157
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:14,340
unprecedented crowd is moving towards the Capitol.

2158
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:19,420
As we speak, as the debate rages inside, President Trump has apparently returned to the White

2159
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:20,420
House.

2160
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:22,580
That's the word that we're receiving from Washington.

2161
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:25,820
He said he was going to go to the Capitol, but it looks like he's gone to the White House

2162
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:26,820
instead.

2163
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:31,780
Many people on Twitter encouraging him to storm the Senate along with his supporters.

2164
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:37,460
And what we're seeing here are the independent journalist videos as the Trump supporters

2165
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:41,300
move once again inexorably towards the Capitol building.

2166
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:45,460
Yeah, I wonder why he would send everybody towards the Capitol and then not go there

2167
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:46,460
himself.

2168
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:47,460
That seems crazy.

2169
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:52,160
That just seems crazy because he's their fearless leader, you know, he's the one at the, no,

2170
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:56,380
they're willing to die for this man because he's willing to die for them.

2171
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:57,380
Yeah.

2172
01:37:57,380 --> 01:38:01,520
This dude is a fucking potster.

2173
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:08,820
So you remember that ragtime music that was playing earlier and the joyous, the joyous

2174
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:12,260
tone square that Rob do was describing.

2175
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:13,260
Yeah.

2176
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:14,260
Yeah.

2177
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:15,260
That vibe has changed.

2178
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:16,260
Oh, it's changed.

2179
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:17,260
Oh, no more flappers dancing.

2180
01:38:17,260 --> 01:38:18,260
Nope.

2181
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:27,220
The joyous, uh, you know, uh, uh, upbeat atmosphere of the event earlier today has soured and

2182
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:33,660
turned to rage as the fury of Trump supporters and Patriots crossing United States overflows

2183
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:37,340
and expresses itself on the outside of the Capitol.

2184
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:43,100
So the, the, the editorial tone, it appears to me to be pretty consistently righteous

2185
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:44,100
indignation.

2186
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:45,100
Yeah.

2187
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:48,140
That is what is motivating this and they are right to do this.

2188
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:51,820
They are right to storm the Capitol and Trump should be right there with them.

2189
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:53,700
Are you saying that the founding fathers were wrong?

2190
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:56,120
Mike Pence wouldn't stop this.

2191
01:38:56,120 --> 01:39:00,420
So someone's got to, or else the constitution has been pissed upon Mike.

2192
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:01,800
Mike Pence is King George.

2193
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,740
We got to take them out.

2194
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:08,180
So the vibe is just excitement kind of about this because there's nothing Harrison can

2195
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:11,060
really do other than be the guy who's calling it.

2196
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:14,260
I'm the guy who gets to be on air while this is going on.

2197
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:15,260
Yeah.

2198
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:20,800
And again, this was as of 24 minutes ago and since then we've seen 24 minutes of rising

2199
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:27,740
aggression, rising crowds, more police building evacuations.

2200
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:34,980
And the reaction from across the nation is largely excitement as far as I'm concerned.

2201
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:40,940
This is again, truly incredible and we'll continue to update and bring you more videos.

2202
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:41,940
The vibe is excitement.

2203
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:42,940
Yeah.

2204
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:44,500
It was not the vibe that I was getting.

2205
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:49,800
I took a, I took a slightly different temperature from the country based on the sense I was

2206
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:56,620
getting, um, yeah, I, it seemed like everybody, uh, soured real quick.

2207
01:39:56,620 --> 01:40:02,740
Everybody was like, Oh, this is, Oh no, Oh no, that's not, Oh no, I didn't want that.

2208
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:12,660
I saw a lot of people responding in ways that, um, were kind of like, Oh, Oh my, like, uh,

2209
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:17,180
I can't believe I didn't see this possibility coming.

2210
01:40:17,180 --> 01:40:21,900
And I think it's a little, which is very funny from, uh, from where I I'm sitting.

2211
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:22,900
Sure.

2212
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:28,460
But I mean, at the same time, I think that had this not have happened this week, yeah,

2213
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:32,100
you and I would have had a show where we would have said, ah, another dumb rally.

2214
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:34,180
What do you, what do you expect is going to happen?

2215
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:39,140
It's more just edging towards the hope that something like this would happen.

2216
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:41,340
I'm not surprised that it did, but I'm shocked.

2217
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:42,620
You know that, that, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2218
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:45,540
I think that there's a lot of people who are surprised.

2219
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:50,460
And I see a lot of like scales falling from people's eyes and it would be easy to respond

2220
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:55,140
to that with some kind of like a flippant, like I told you so, or, you know, like I get

2221
01:40:55,140 --> 01:41:00,220
on our, I, I, I'm glad that I haven't seen a lot of that because I think that that's

2222
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:01,220
really counterproductive.

2223
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:02,220
Yeah, totally.

2224
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:07,540
And I hope that people who, I mean, I did tell you so though, you want to engage in

2225
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:08,540
that.

2226
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:09,540
That's your business.

2227
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:10,540
But I was facetious.

2228
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:11,540
I know.

2229
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:12,540
I know.

2230
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:13,540
Come on.

2231
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:18,020
There's a white right wing extremist storming the white house and they're like, oh, this

2232
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:21,460
is what people have been talking about for a while.

2233
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:22,820
That is fucked up.

2234
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:23,820
All right.

2235
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:24,820
Okay.

2236
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:25,820
Great.

2237
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:30,140
No need to shame anybody as long as they remember that this is a problem.

2238
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:31,140
Yeah.

2239
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:32,140
Tomorrow too.

2240
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:33,140
Yes.

2241
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:34,140
It didn't stop yesterday.

2242
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:35,140
No.

2243
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:37,780
And it doesn't, and today, I mean, spoiler alert, we don't know what Alex's response

2244
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:42,200
is to it, but Trump has basically been like, all right, whatever, it's over.

2245
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:44,260
It reminded me, and that doesn't end it.

2246
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:45,260
Yeah.

2247
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:46,260
No, no, no, no, no.

2248
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:47,260
That does not end the problem.

2249
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:51,340
The reaction to it reminded me so much of, uh, my partner was watching a documentary

2250
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:56,300
the other day and they, some, one of the bad guys, it was like a crime documentary about

2251
01:41:56,300 --> 01:42:00,900
a small town that had gotten rogue with the police department and the Sheriff's department.

2252
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:03,100
And she was like, can you believe this?

2253
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:07,760
This guy thinks that the Sheriff is the highest constitutional power in the land.

2254
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:11,080
And I was like, well, baby, you ain't got no idea.

2255
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:13,900
Let me tell you about, uh, one sixth of the country.

2256
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:14,900
Yeah.

2257
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:15,900
And that's, that's what I'm saying.

2258
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:20,980
Like all these people watch this and I'm like, and it's the same reaction of, of like, I,

2259
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:24,180
I know you thought that that couldn't be real.

2260
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:25,180
Yeah.

2261
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:26,180
Oh, but it is.

2262
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:27,180
One sixth of the country is too high.

2263
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:31,860
I was, I was, I was desperately grasping for a number and that's what came to my head.

2264
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:33,740
This is why Trump can't do rallies anymore.

2265
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:34,740
Too many numbers.

2266
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:40,740
Um, so, but it comes down to, for Harrison though, again, is just righteous indignation.

2267
01:42:40,740 --> 01:42:42,480
That is the name of the game.

2268
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:48,940
We do know is that the Washington establishment is scrambling any and all officers they have

2269
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:55,180
at their command in order to deal with this massive outpouring of anger, fury, and righteous

2270
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:59,220
indignation coming from the Trump supporters.

2271
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:05,260
You can there see, we have the Fox News feed up and even they are having trouble maintaining

2272
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:07,860
the integrity of their signal.

2273
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:09,740
So yeah, it's just righteous indignation.

2274
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:14,820
These people have been pushed to the point where this, this response is the only, only

2275
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:16,280
thing that can be done.

2276
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:21,460
You have created an imaginary reality wherein I have pushed, been pushed too far.

2277
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:22,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2278
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:26,060
So there's rallies going on in other states as well.

2279
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:29,740
There's some fucked up stuff happening elsewhere.

2280
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:34,260
Harrison covers this and then says something pretty scary.

2281
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:37,900
Los Angeles as well, a stop the steal rally lining the streets.

2282
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:44,820
Hundreds of Trump supporters, people cheering it on on Twitter saying, drag them out, saying

2283
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:48,540
go into the Capitol building and drag the traitors out.

2284
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:53,300
That does not seem like something that could have been impossible.

2285
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:54,300
No.

2286
01:43:54,300 --> 01:44:01,380
Had things gone slightly differently, I could see some harm coming to representatives and

2287
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:02,380
Congress members.

2288
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:04,260
No, there were people walking around with zip ties.

2289
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:05,420
I saw those pictures.

2290
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:11,620
I didn't have a chance to look into them enough to feel really confident, but that was really

2291
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:12,620
scary.

2292
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:13,620
Yeah.

2293
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:19,220
The people who tweeted them out, I trust enough to be like, I have to go search down every,

2294
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:20,220
you know?

2295
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:21,220
No, totally.

2296
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:28,300
I just, for my standpoint, I didn't want to, I didn't, I can't, I can't back that a hundred

2297
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:33,740
percent of my own looking into it, but I don't think it's fake.

2298
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:35,460
I just don't know enough.

2299
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:37,900
But that's scary as hell.

2300
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:45,460
Even the possibility that that is what someone was up to going to take hostages or some shit.

2301
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:48,780
Put a citizen's arrest on Chuck Schumer or something.

2302
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:49,780
Like it's terrifying.

2303
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:50,780
Wow.

2304
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:53,460
I guess we have slightly different takes.

2305
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:55,060
No, I understand.

2306
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:58,460
It is terrifying, but it is also deeply funny.

2307
01:44:58,460 --> 01:44:59,680
That's the problem.

2308
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:05,780
That's where I'm, I'm struggling with this because we are looking at a group of people

2309
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:12,260
who stormed the fucking Capitol building, but we are also looking at a series of pictures

2310
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:16,260
of people smoking weed in Nancy Pelosi's office.

2311
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:18,860
So that's deeply funny.

2312
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:19,860
Sorry.

2313
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:23,580
So Harrison is going on and I just can't hear this as anything other than just like, this

2314
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:26,360
is really positive coverage.

2315
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:31,700
There are people such as a Dana lash saying, stop this to Trump supporters who are moving

2316
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:33,080
towards the Capitol.

2317
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:35,340
Other people saying, get in there and tear them out.

2318
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:39,140
Oh, here we see my God, these images are just incredible.

2319
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:44,140
Massive numbers of Patriots storming the Capitol building, Texas flags waving American flags

2320
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:49,520
waving and masses of humanity have apparently broken past the police barricades, which were

2321
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:52,380
keeping them off the steps and away from the Capitol building.

2322
01:45:52,380 --> 01:46:00,460
They have been torn down and the people have moved onto that raised platform and are scaling

2323
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:03,120
the scaffolding that was set up.

2324
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:09,900
So at this point, you know, we don't have people inside, but you do have an awareness

2325
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:15,660
that there are people who are a large mass of folks who are not seeming to have all that

2326
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:22,100
much resistance from the authorities who are making their way towards the Capitol building.

2327
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:26,800
You have people online who are expressing a desire for people to be dragged out.

2328
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:30,960
You have people who want Trump to come and lead a charge on the Senate.

2329
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,580
So you have that awareness.

2330
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:40,260
And when you have that in the, in the sort of context of what's going on, you hear a

2331
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:44,120
clip like this and you're like, you just want somebody to kill.

2332
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:47,220
You just want, you want somebody to kill someone you don't like.

2333
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:48,220
Incredible.

2334
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:51,980
And the crowd continues to swell.

2335
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:52,980
What was it?

2336
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:54,780
I mean, I've lost track of time.

2337
01:46:54,780 --> 01:47:01,500
I think it was less than an hour ago, an hour ago that President Trump finished his speech

2338
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:06,220
and that massive crowd of hundreds of thousands, probably upwards of a million people surrounding

2339
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:11,660
the Washington monuments and all the way to the White House finished watching that speech

2340
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:14,660
by President Trump and moved towards the U.S. Capitol.

2341
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:20,620
And by the time that, uh, here we see an update from Ilhan Omar, currency in the Capitol buildings

2342
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:22,780
are locked down and everyone is sheltering in place.

2343
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:25,620
Hey, so look, that's where Ilhan Omar is, everyone.

2344
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:26,620
Just kidding.

2345
01:47:26,620 --> 01:47:27,620
Uh, uh, what?

2346
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:28,620
No, just kidding.

2347
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:30,400
That's not just kidding.

2348
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:34,980
The joke is, hey, from this vantage point, you can tell where she is.

2349
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:39,660
You know that there are tons of people who are, who are storming the Capitol building

2350
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:43,680
and now you're saying, hey, wouldn't it be fun if one of you, wouldn't it be fun?

2351
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:44,900
She's just joking.

2352
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:45,900
That's where she is.

2353
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:46,900
Yeah, that's, that's...

2354
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:51,660
This person who we've expressed extensive hatred for.

2355
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:54,360
Yeah, yeah.

2356
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:58,620
Even if I believed somebody was joking when they said that, that's poor taste.

2357
01:47:58,620 --> 01:47:59,620
Oh yeah.

2358
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:00,620
And he's not joking.

2359
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:01,620
And he's not joking.

2360
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:02,620
No.

2361
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:04,860
So don't give me this just JK bullshit.

2362
01:48:04,860 --> 01:48:05,860
Yeah.

2363
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:09,380
I would say that Harrison is pragmatic to a fault.

2364
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:15,260
Um, and that is that he, it does not care at all about the people in the, in the Congress

2365
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:16,260
building.

2366
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:17,260
Sure.

2367
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:21,880
And to a certain extent, I kind of get where he's coming from in terms of like, there are

2368
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:23,700
safety precautions in place.

2369
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:24,700
Yeah.

2370
01:48:24,700 --> 01:48:25,700
Like there are evacuation routes.

2371
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:26,700
Yeah.

2372
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:29,500
There are, you know, so I get, I get where he's coming from.

2373
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:35,300
It doesn't seem super callous, I guess, but he is just like, eh, who cares?

2374
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:38,980
They'll be able, the people inside aren't in any danger.

2375
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:43,820
The congressmen and women and senators, I don't think are at much of a threat.

2376
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:46,940
We know there's one thing they take very, very seriously.

2377
01:48:46,940 --> 01:48:50,180
It is their own personal wellbeing and their own security.

2378
01:48:50,180 --> 01:48:57,300
There are tunnels of course, crisscrossing like spiderwebs throughout all of DC and there's

2379
01:48:57,300 --> 01:49:02,420
almost no risk of them having to try to escape through a crowd or having to bunker down in

2380
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:03,420
the Capitol building.

2381
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:06,940
They have escape routes more than they need.

2382
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:11,260
So again, I do not think there's actually a bodily threat to anybody in the chambers

2383
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:12,260
at this moment.

2384
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:13,380
They don't seem too concerned.

2385
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:18,540
They're continuing to argue, continuing to debate without so much as a look over their

2386
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:22,260
shoulder as to the doors being broken down or anything like that.

2387
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:28,140
This is simply a massive protest that is refusing to stay quiet any longer.

2388
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:30,000
That is making themselves known.

2389
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:35,960
That is not stopping at the barricades, not a cow towing and adhering to the police who

2390
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:40,420
have betrayed us time and time again, but instead are pushing forward to take over what

2391
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:44,100
is, at the heart of it, our building.

2392
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:49,420
I find it hard to believe that they would be covering, let's say, Black Lives Matter

2393
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:51,300
protest at the White House similarly.

2394
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:52,300
No, the same way.

2395
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:53,300
Same way.

2396
01:49:53,300 --> 01:49:59,820
I seem to recall when, over the summer, when there were those large fences that people

2397
01:49:59,820 --> 01:50:04,020
were up against and like, you know, yelling at cops and maybe somebody threw a water bottle.

2398
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:05,020
Right, right.

2399
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:06,980
A water bottle was a dangerous instrument.

2400
01:50:06,980 --> 01:50:07,980
Yeah, yeah.

2401
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:13,820
Then it wasn't, you know, a situation where everyone's safe inside, they've got evacuation

2402
01:50:13,820 --> 01:50:14,820
routes.

2403
01:50:14,820 --> 01:50:15,820
Right.

2404
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:16,820
Right.

2405
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:17,820
I don't know.

2406
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:18,820
It just seems a little bit selective.

2407
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:19,820
I do.

2408
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:23,460
I do like the, they have more escape tunnels than they need.

2409
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:25,100
That's such a funny way of putting it.

2410
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:26,100
They're lousy with escape tunnels.

2411
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:29,500
That is such a funny, they've got more than they even need.

2412
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:30,500
Yeah.

2413
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:33,380
This is the type of thing we're wasting taxpayers' money on.

2414
01:50:33,380 --> 01:50:34,380
Yeah.

2415
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:35,380
They've got four escape tunnels.

2416
01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:37,780
They've got four that don't go anywhere.

2417
01:50:37,780 --> 01:50:42,120
It's like that Futurama joke where they're carrying the tanker full of oil and he's like,

2418
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:44,460
this has 5,000 hulls.

2419
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:48,740
And whenever it breaks open, there's like, oh, if only there were 5,001 hulls.

2420
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:52,540
It would be great if there's just like, there's so many escape tunnels down here.

2421
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:53,940
There's like, they go in circles.

2422
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:54,940
Yeah.

2423
01:50:54,940 --> 01:50:55,940
It's just pointless.

2424
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:56,940
It's just out of control.

2425
01:50:56,940 --> 01:50:57,940
Yeah.

2426
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:59,940
So now.

2427
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:04,660
That's where all, if, if the Capitol building turned into the Scooby-Doo bit, where they're

2428
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:08,060
all going up through the tunnel and exiting one door and then closing it and then coming

2429
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:09,060
back out.

2430
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:10,060
That'd be great.

2431
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:11,060
So good.

2432
01:51:11,060 --> 01:51:15,060
So at this point, people have breached the building and this is where I think a lot of

2433
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:19,500
people around the country and the world were like, oh boy, fuck.

2434
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:20,500
Oh shit.

2435
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:25,300
Senators, the vice president, the congressmen now no doubt making their way towards the

2436
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:30,540
security of the underground tunnels to escort them away from the threat of their supposed

2437
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:36,740
constituents, angry, furious, and now venting that frustration on the system that has betrayed

2438
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:38,340
them time and time again.

2439
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:39,740
This is just incredible folks.

2440
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:41,140
You're watching info wars.

2441
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:45,700
So you've got people who have come in and the, uh, the evacuation, they're afraid of

2442
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:46,700
their constituents.

2443
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:49,020
It's an interesting way to frame it.

2444
01:51:49,020 --> 01:51:54,900
There's a certain part of me that almost is like good on you for sticking with it longer

2445
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:56,860
than most of the right wing media did.

2446
01:51:56,860 --> 01:52:00,300
Well, you know, like they were already at the point where they're like, this is wrong

2447
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:01,300
and all this stuff.

2448
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:04,700
And Harrison Smith is like, this is what we guys, this is what we wanted.

2449
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:08,020
I remember I wanted, I want to disagree with the phrasing.

2450
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:09,020
Good on you.

2451
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:10,020
Yeah.

2452
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:11,020
Yeah.

2453
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:12,020
Yeah.

2454
01:52:12,020 --> 01:52:13,020
What you're trying to say, I agree with.

2455
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:14,020
Yeah.

2456
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:15,020
Yeah.

2457
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:16,020
It's remarkable that you are still, you're still on it, buddy.

2458
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:17,020
Everybody.

2459
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:18,620
You, if you, at this point, everyone was cutting bait.

2460
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:21,980
What you didn't realize is that you thought everybody was in a line right next to you

2461
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:26,420
and you took one step forward and they are gone.

2462
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:27,620
There's nobody behind me.

2463
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:28,620
Yeah, no.

2464
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:29,620
Harrison is thrilled.

2465
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:30,620
It's a privilege for him.

2466
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:31,620
Of course.

2467
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:36,820
Uh, at least I would say my estimation, a million Trump supporters having moved from

2468
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:40,060
throughout to DC and are now converging on the Capitol.

2469
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:42,060
This is revolution in progress.

2470
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:47,020
This is a major historic moment in the history of the United States and is a privilege and

2471
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:52,100
an honor to be here sharing it with you and bringing you updates just as soon as possible.

2472
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:56,540
I suspect that he may be more of a true believer than a lot of the people at Infowars.

2473
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:58,300
Yeah, that sounds like true belief.

2474
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:00,740
And I also think he's a dork.

2475
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:02,500
Uh, yeah.

2476
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:03,500
Anyway.

2477
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:09,980
I'm, I'm just saying, uh, yes, it is a historic moment, uh, but it will probably be remembered

2478
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:15,660
more for an idiot in a headdress smiling, carrying a podium than, uh, the, uh,

2479
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:16,980
There will be a resonant image.

2480
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:17,980
Yeah.

2481
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:22,780
But, uh, in order to justify a lot of this, I think, I think Harrison probably has a good

2482
01:53:22,780 --> 01:53:25,580
sense that like, well, people aren't going to like this too much.

2483
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:26,580
Hmm.

2484
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:30,540
Going to have to make this palatable, uh, to some of the more normie, uh, parts of the

2485
01:53:30,540 --> 01:53:33,260
audience as if Infowars has a lot of that.

2486
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:34,260
Yeah, no ton of them.

2487
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:39,500
Um, the only way that they can do this is by being like, the left protests a lot and

2488
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:42,180
CVS is burned down and stuff.

2489
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:49,540
We've seen six months or more of violent protest burning down entire cities, aimless, pointless

2490
01:53:49,540 --> 01:53:55,300
destruction being wrought across the United States by liberal and communist agitators,

2491
01:53:55,300 --> 01:53:57,940
all to the point of trying to tear down our system.

2492
01:53:57,940 --> 01:54:03,900
Now we see not the system fight back, but those who love America fight back patriots

2493
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:08,900
now taking over the entire Capitol steps, continuing to wave the American flag, the

2494
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:13,740
Gadsden flag, the tree of Liberty flag, the Trump flag.

2495
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:15,460
They've taken it over.

2496
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:16,460
It is done.

2497
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:18,580
This is what happens when Americans rise up.

2498
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:23,980
This is what happens when patriots do what the communists have been trying to do for

2499
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:24,980
so long.

2500
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:25,980
This doesn't look great.

2501
01:54:25,980 --> 01:54:28,340
I want to, I want them to eat those words.

2502
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:32,540
I would like to print those words out and I would like to see them eat those papers.

2503
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:37,380
I don't, I don't think this is going to age great.

2504
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:42,660
I think Alex might be needing to fire Harrison soon and it's not because he didn't take calls

2505
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:43,660
on the American Journal.

2506
01:54:43,660 --> 01:54:44,660
No, no, no, no.

2507
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:48,660
I think that this is something Alex is- It's because he will be getting some calls

2508
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:49,660
from the authorities.

2509
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:53,740
I think at a certain point, Alex might have to pretend a lot of this stuff didn't, uh,

2510
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:54,740
this wasn't what we did.

2511
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:58,100
This is a rogue Infowars employee who is saying all of this stuff.

2512
01:54:58,100 --> 01:54:59,100
I don't know Harrison.

2513
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:02,140
The views expressed by Harrison Smith do not represent-

2514
01:55:02,140 --> 01:55:03,260
I never met that guy.

2515
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:04,260
Never heard of him.

2516
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:05,260
He's an independent contractor.

2517
01:55:05,260 --> 01:55:06,260
Did you know that, Dan?

2518
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:10,820
We found those Soros contracts with Antifa though, which we love to report on, Alex.

2519
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:13,220
Anyway, this is all just the globalists, man.

2520
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:15,620
They've pushed Patriots too far.

2521
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:16,620
Totally.

2522
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:22,100
I have in my note here, this is dramatically pro-storming coverage.

2523
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:27,080
Time and time again, the American people have shrugged and taken the blows on the back without

2524
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:33,300
so much as a whimper in protest, but finally they have pushed too far after stealing our

2525
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:34,300
last resort.

2526
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:37,420
They always knew in the back of our minds, in the back of our heads, we had the numbers.

2527
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:38,420
We had the will.

2528
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:44,300
We could, through the electoral process, maintain some semblance of control over what is supposed

2529
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:48,060
to be our representative democracy, our republic.

2530
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:50,260
Well, they stole that from us.

2531
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:52,460
They took away the final lifeline.

2532
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:57,300
They destroyed the final pressure valve, and now the rage of the American people overflows

2533
01:55:57,300 --> 01:56:03,300
as Patriots storm into the United States Capitol, waving Trump flags, waving American flags,

2534
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:07,820
waving the Gadson flag, taking over the steps, pushing through the doors, and forcing an

2535
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:14,240
evacuation of our representatives as they halt the vote counting process.

2536
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:15,240
He's loving this.

2537
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:16,240
Yeah.

2538
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:17,240
Yep.

2539
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:18,620
This is the best day of Harrison's career.

2540
01:56:18,620 --> 01:56:24,640
It is so funny listening to that in retrospect, just because that like, this is an ocean wave

2541
01:56:24,640 --> 01:56:30,500
that's coming, and all I can think in my head is, no, you guys have been terrorist edging

2542
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:33,900
for a long time, and your idiots came too soon.

2543
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:34,900
That's what happened.

2544
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:40,100
Yeah, and you're going to end up having to make the best of it, and I think that Alex

2545
01:56:40,100 --> 01:56:45,420
can get that sense once he shows up, but Harrison isn't experienced enough.

2546
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:51,260
He doesn't really know how to play the game that Alex needs to play in order to be profitable

2547
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:52,580
in situations like this.

2548
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:56,380
This is going to take some fine threading, if you will.

2549
01:56:56,380 --> 01:56:59,540
Because Harrison actually believes that there's a chance that this is going to lead to a real

2550
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:00,540
revolution.

2551
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:01,540
We're going to do it.

2552
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:02,540
We're going to take him over.

2553
01:57:02,540 --> 01:57:03,540
Where Trump is going to stay in office.

2554
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:04,540
Absolutely.

2555
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:05,540
Yeah.

2556
01:57:05,540 --> 01:57:06,540
Nonsense.

2557
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:07,540
Yeah.

2558
01:57:07,540 --> 01:57:08,540
So anyway, he tries to go to Alex, because Alex is in D.C.

2559
01:57:08,540 --> 01:57:09,540
He's somewhere.

2560
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:10,540
What are we going to figure this out?

2561
01:57:10,540 --> 01:57:13,540
Ah, doesn't really, can't quite get a hold of him.

2562
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:14,540
Got to go to break.

2563
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:17,540
But Americans are mad, and so when they stage elections in Venezuela, are they speechless?

2564
01:57:17,540 --> 01:57:20,540
These incredible folks live updates from Alex Jones, more on the other side.

2565
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:23,940
The Capitol has fallen, the Patriots are in control.

2566
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:28,540
The Patriots are in control, the Capitol has fallen.

2567
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:33,060
So he's able to get a hold of Alex there, but he can't talk to him.

2568
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:34,060
Alex is just rambling.

2569
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:35,060
Hilarious.

2570
01:57:35,060 --> 01:57:39,740
So they go to break, and the fucking Capitol has fallen, is the report.

2571
01:57:39,740 --> 01:57:46,540
You know, one thing that I like to do is sometimes while the craziest shit is going on, I'll

2572
01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:52,620
split screen it on my computer with just like a stock feed.

2573
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:55,140
The Capitol has fallen.

2574
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:57,140
Patriots have taken over.

2575
01:57:57,140 --> 01:58:00,780
Stocks go up by like one point.

2576
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:07,180
Do you think the stocks would just stay the same if the entire United States had been

2577
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:08,180
overthrown?

2578
01:58:08,180 --> 01:58:09,180
Well, I mean.

2579
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:10,180
And Patriots had, come on.

2580
01:58:10,180 --> 01:58:15,740
I know that the stock market lives and dies by the reportage of Harrison Smith.

2581
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:16,740
Yes, exactly.

2582
01:58:16,740 --> 01:58:20,100
As he's the most trusted newsman of our generation.

2583
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:21,100
The Cronkite.

2584
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:22,940
So, the paper of record.

2585
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:24,100
Millennial Cronkite.

2586
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:26,980
That's what they call him.

2587
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:32,060
The young gray lady.

2588
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:34,620
Old wolf in sheep's clothing blitzer.

2589
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:35,620
Yeah.

2590
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:37,780
So, Harrison has a little thought here.

2591
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:41,340
It's like, hey, we stopped the steel.

2592
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:49,260
Just the sheer crowds all over the Capitol steps waving stop the steel signs, waving

2593
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:50,620
American flags.

2594
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:53,460
For the time being, at least the steel has been stopped.

2595
01:58:53,460 --> 01:59:01,940
We have, we're no longer counting the votes, no longer debating the certification.

2596
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:09,940
It has all ground to a halt, it has all ceased to continue as the lawmakers and the other

2597
01:59:09,940 --> 01:59:11,820
Capitol Hill staffers flee.

2598
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:21,140
I just have this picture in my head of Harrison Smith in a fighter pilot outfit on an aircraft

2599
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:23,140
carrier with a big banner.

2600
01:59:23,140 --> 01:59:24,140
Totally.

2601
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:25,140
100%.

2602
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:26,140
Steel stopped.

2603
01:59:26,140 --> 01:59:28,700
Big banner behind.

2604
01:59:28,700 --> 01:59:34,580
I don't know if we can print up a better Dewey defeats Truman than we stopped the steel.

2605
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:37,340
At least he had the good sense to say at least temporarily.

2606
01:59:37,340 --> 01:59:39,940
At least, yeah, I was going to say.

2607
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:40,940
Good work, buddy.

2608
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:48,100
So, there's some stuff going on and it involves protesters, right wing ding dongs, assaulting

2609
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:52,380
officers and Harrison's pretty excited about that.

2610
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:57,740
My God, now the protesters have gotten their hands on fire extinguishers and are spraying

2611
01:59:57,740 --> 02:00:03,420
them at the people, the congressional staffers and members of the media who are attempting

2612
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:04,420
to film them.

2613
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:10,320
They're getting a face full of fire extinguisher gas as police continue to radio and we heard

2614
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:15,580
over the radio from the US Capitol Police, we have lost control, repeat, we have lost

2615
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:17,580
control.

2616
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:21,500
Control now seated to the patriots who have breached the Capitol.

2617
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:26,540
Alex did like days worth of coverage about people yelling at Sarah Huckabee Sanders at

2618
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:27,540
a restaurant.

2619
02:00:27,540 --> 02:00:28,540
They made her feel bad.

2620
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:30,960
They made her feel bad, it was public.

2621
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:35,380
Every private citizen is entitled to the right to go eat at a restaurant.

2622
02:00:35,380 --> 02:00:37,780
What if they had sprayed her with a fire extinguisher?

2623
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:41,020
Well, now that's fine.

2624
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:43,180
What is she afraid of her constituents, Dan?

2625
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:47,260
Strictly speaking, that is assault and we've already heard him talking about punching and

2626
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:53,620
macing coming towards the officers, so that's at least three instances that Harrison is

2627
02:00:53,620 --> 02:01:00,820
very keenly aware of, of violence that's being done by these people against the cops.

2628
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:09,900
Now obviously no situation is perfect at any protest and I don't think that you can respond

2629
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:15,900
to the entirety of the group just based on the actions of an individual, but those people

2630
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:18,620
should definitely have been treated differently.

2631
02:01:18,620 --> 02:01:23,240
What they're doing is not appropriate and it's not property damage that is directed

2632
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:28,580
towards bodily harm and hurting another person, which is now assault.

2633
02:01:28,580 --> 02:01:33,500
Anyway, I just want to make a clear line there because Harrison later will pretend that he's

2634
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:35,500
not aware of any violence.

2635
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:37,500
No violent actions happen.

2636
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:44,740
So also, interestingly, Harrison's thrilled that they've stolen police equipment.

2637
02:01:44,740 --> 02:01:52,840
People now ceded to the patriots who have breached the Capitol and are moving ever further

2638
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:54,620
into this Capitol building.

2639
02:01:54,620 --> 02:01:59,100
People dressed as pioneers, people carrying riot shields that have been stripped from

2640
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:07,420
the Capitol City police, MAGA hats, Confederate flags, American flags, Gadson flags.

2641
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:15,900
I just can't imagine, you know, the picture, you know, the left-wing protesters have stolen

2642
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:19,060
riot shields from police and they've entered the state out.

2643
02:02:19,060 --> 02:02:22,220
I can't imagine you being like, this is protest.

2644
02:02:22,220 --> 02:02:23,220
Yeah, yeah.

2645
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:27,860
You would say this is America's fallen or whatever the fuck, but I guess he is actually

2646
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:28,860
saying America's fallen.

2647
02:02:28,860 --> 02:02:29,860
Yeah, that's true.

2648
02:02:29,860 --> 02:02:30,860
We have now taken it.

2649
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:32,860
Yeah, we're stoked about it.

2650
02:02:32,860 --> 02:02:35,780
I guess there isn't that much difference, honestly.

2651
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:37,980
Yeah, man, weird.

2652
02:02:37,980 --> 02:02:41,980
Weird to think of the number of dead that there would have been if this was a left-wing

2653
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:42,980
crowd.

2654
02:02:42,980 --> 02:02:44,340
Oh, the people who are...

2655
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:46,020
So many people would have been killed.

2656
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:48,180
Yeah, I think you're right.

2657
02:02:48,180 --> 02:02:53,340
It's tough to litigate that kind of what-if, but yeah, I think...

2658
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:58,140
You know that whole, like, how is it that so many people could do this?

2659
02:02:58,140 --> 02:03:02,680
I thought if you went for the Capitol building, you would just get mowed down, you know?

2660
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:06,820
If this was a left-wing protest, oh, believe me, you would have.

2661
02:03:06,820 --> 02:03:10,820
It seems that way, yeah.

2662
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:17,640
So Harrison's still giving positive coverage of this event, and at this point, he does

2663
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:24,580
know that they've shot tear gas in the chamber, and he's kind of aware that someone got shot.

2664
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:27,680
He doesn't know any of the details about it, but he's aware that someone...

2665
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:31,460
There's reports that someone's been shot, and he's still like, eh, it's good times.

2666
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:35,380
From Disclose TV, protesters are smashing the doors to the U.S. House chamber.

2667
02:03:35,380 --> 02:03:39,260
That's the image that we saw just a second ago of the furniture being piled up in an

2668
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:44,780
attempt to prevent, or at least waylay or delay, the breaking into the House chamber

2669
02:03:44,780 --> 02:03:45,780
there.

2670
02:03:45,780 --> 02:03:50,140
U.S. Senate chamber has been evacuated, and senators are being taken to a secure location.

2671
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:54,900
House members are being instructed to put on masks as tear gas is now inside the U.S.

2672
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:56,140
Capitol dome, folks.

2673
02:03:56,140 --> 02:03:58,300
This is, again, unprecedented.

2674
02:03:58,300 --> 02:04:01,340
This is history being made as we speak.

2675
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:04,060
So this is, like, severe.

2676
02:04:04,060 --> 02:04:09,940
Like the situation has deteriorated to an outrageous extent, and Harrison's still definitely

2677
02:04:09,940 --> 02:04:16,060
cool with it, to the point where he's saying, like, yeah, they're rioting, but good.

2678
02:04:16,060 --> 02:04:18,220
We took back the Capitol.

2679
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:24,460
The security of the Capitol building has been utterly devastated and decimated, and the

2680
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:25,460
rioter...

2681
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:26,460
Well, yeah, I guess we'll call them rioters.

2682
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:27,740
Why the hell not, right?

2683
02:04:27,740 --> 02:04:33,380
The rioters, the protesters, the patriots, the Americans, the Trump supporters, the revolutionaries

2684
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:34,800
have taken the Capitol.

2685
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:37,740
The U.S. Capitol has fallen to the American people.

2686
02:04:37,740 --> 02:04:41,060
This day will go down in history, ladies and gentlemen, and you're getting it all live

2687
02:04:41,060 --> 02:04:43,180
here at m4wars.com.

2688
02:04:43,180 --> 02:04:46,900
Make no mistake about it, this would still be the tone if it had been successful.

2689
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:47,900
Yeah.

2690
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:48,900
Yeah, totally.

2691
02:04:48,900 --> 02:04:49,900
Like, this is...

2692
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:51,260
It would have been more jubilant.

2693
02:04:51,260 --> 02:04:52,260
Yes.

2694
02:04:52,260 --> 02:04:53,260
Yeah.

2695
02:04:53,260 --> 02:04:56,060
This would have continued if shit did not fall apart, and people didn't just leave.

2696
02:04:56,060 --> 02:05:01,820
I want to bottle the feeling of joy that he felt for almost a short period of time.

2697
02:05:01,820 --> 02:05:02,820
Mm-hmm.

2698
02:05:02,820 --> 02:05:03,820
Because that must have been really nice.

2699
02:05:03,820 --> 02:05:08,620
Yeah, but it also comes hand in hand with the embarrassment that he's got to feel now,

2700
02:05:08,620 --> 02:05:09,620
because this was recorded.

2701
02:05:09,620 --> 02:05:10,620
Oh, yeah.

2702
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:14,620
That's why I would only bottle the joy, and I would enjoy that like a cold glass of water.

2703
02:05:14,620 --> 02:05:15,620
Sorry.

2704
02:05:15,620 --> 02:05:16,620
Mm, that joy is delicious.

2705
02:05:16,620 --> 02:05:18,220
That joy causes the hangover.

2706
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:22,380
Harrison, you can keep the embarrassment and sadness of being you.

2707
02:05:22,380 --> 02:05:28,820
And unfortunately, that joy has the hangover effect of realizing you were so naive.

2708
02:05:28,820 --> 02:05:30,300
So fucking stupid.

2709
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:31,300
Yeah.

2710
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:34,900
Anyway, at this point, Harrison is heard...

2711
02:05:34,900 --> 02:05:37,860
He didn't mention it in that last clip, but he is aware at that point that someone had

2712
02:05:37,860 --> 02:05:39,100
been shot.

2713
02:05:39,100 --> 02:05:43,020
And so now he's reporting that he's heard that someone got shot in the arm.

2714
02:05:43,020 --> 02:05:48,640
Just got this information not confirmed, but we have reports of a woman shot in the arm

2715
02:05:48,640 --> 02:05:50,620
attempting to breach the chamber.

2716
02:05:50,620 --> 02:05:56,620
So we have guns drawn inside the chamber, furniture piled against the door, the security

2717
02:05:56,620 --> 02:06:01,620
is firing out through the door, and is apparently shot woman in the arm.

2718
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:06,900
So this is the reporting that he's giving based on preliminary stuff, which is incorrect,

2719
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:10,980
but you know, oftentimes as information's coming in, you can make some mistakes here

2720
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:11,980
and there.

2721
02:06:11,980 --> 02:06:14,660
I'm not going to hold it against him too harshly.

2722
02:06:14,660 --> 02:06:17,940
I am going to blame him for being so goddamn boring.

2723
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:21,700
I've got to assure you all, Alex will be coming back eventually.

2724
02:06:21,700 --> 02:06:24,740
We'll get to Alex.

2725
02:06:24,740 --> 02:06:29,820
How can you think that you are living through a successful overthrow of the United States

2726
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:34,260
government by your side, and still be this boring?

2727
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:35,260
Yeah.

2728
02:06:35,260 --> 02:06:40,140
Well, I mean, on some level he knows he took over for David Knight, so...

2729
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:41,140
Well, that's fair.

2730
02:06:41,140 --> 02:06:42,140
He knows where the bread's buttered.

2731
02:06:42,140 --> 02:06:43,700
He's got to deliver.

2732
02:06:43,700 --> 02:06:45,620
He's got big shoes to fill.

2733
02:06:45,620 --> 02:06:48,020
Alex probably hired him, he's like, I need a boring guy.

2734
02:06:48,020 --> 02:06:49,540
I need another boring guy.

2735
02:06:49,540 --> 02:06:52,380
I need a backup boring guy in case my relief...

2736
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:53,620
You're my boring understudy.

2737
02:06:53,620 --> 02:06:55,500
Yeah, you're my relief pitcher.

2738
02:06:55,500 --> 02:07:00,980
So at this point, there's a video going around of some people commandeering a window washing

2739
02:07:00,980 --> 02:07:01,980
rig.

2740
02:07:01,980 --> 02:07:02,980
Sure.

2741
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:03,980
Yeah.

2742
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:04,980
And Harrison's fucking pumped.

2743
02:07:04,980 --> 02:07:05,980
Oh my God.

2744
02:07:05,980 --> 02:07:06,980
This is amazing.

2745
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:09,220
All right, so now we're seeing video of the protesters.

2746
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:14,780
They seem to have commandeered a window washing platform, and are raising themselves up to

2747
02:07:14,780 --> 02:07:18,820
the second floor to perhaps breach the windows there.

2748
02:07:18,820 --> 02:07:21,860
Trump flags waving, American flags waving.

2749
02:07:21,860 --> 02:07:22,860
Shots have been fired.

2750
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:29,060
We have reports of one woman shot from a protester, a female protester, has been shot by the Capitol

2751
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:35,460
security presumably, who is inside the house chamber there, furniture piled up against

2752
02:07:35,460 --> 02:07:36,460
the door.

2753
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:38,020
There were protesters trying to get through that door.

2754
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:42,980
Shots were fired through the window of that door, and seemingly struck a protester.

2755
02:07:42,980 --> 02:07:48,300
These are the unconfirmed reports that we are receiving from less than a minute ago,

2756
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:51,140
and we'll continue to bring you updates as we get them, folks.

2757
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:56,780
This is the revolution, and it's only going to be televised on Infowars.com.

2758
02:07:56,780 --> 02:07:57,780
I'm receiving updates.

2759
02:07:57,780 --> 02:07:58,780
Oh.

2760
02:07:58,780 --> 02:07:59,780
What a dork.

2761
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:00,780
Oh, what a loser.

2762
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:02,320
What a loser.

2763
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:05,980
You really think this is only going to be covered by Infowars?

2764
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:06,980
So funny.

2765
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:08,300
What a fucking...

2766
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:11,780
Oh, we are getting reports that the Death Star is going down.

2767
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:13,380
Oh, no, I can see it.

2768
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:19,860
Luke Skywalker has commandeered a window washing vehicle, and he is slowly making his way towards

2769
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:22,260
the exhaust port.

2770
02:08:22,260 --> 02:08:25,260
We are going to be televising this the entire way.

2771
02:08:25,260 --> 02:08:31,140
I love this dumb, dumb ass kind of thing where it would be like someone being like, Richard

2772
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:32,860
Nixon has resigned.

2773
02:08:32,860 --> 02:08:37,220
That's the kind of news you're only going to hear on my channel.

2774
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:39,260
No, everyone's going to cover that.

2775
02:08:39,260 --> 02:08:45,060
Ladies and gentlemen, I am sad to report that JFK has been assassinated.

2776
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:46,060
You'll not hear that on other networks.

2777
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:49,380
You are only going to hear that on Infowars.

2778
02:08:49,380 --> 02:08:51,260
No one else is saying shit about it.

2779
02:08:51,260 --> 02:08:57,020
Pretending this isn't a gigantic news story that is going to dominate every news cycle

2780
02:08:57,020 --> 02:08:58,020
for a while.

2781
02:08:58,020 --> 02:08:59,020
So ridiculous.

2782
02:08:59,020 --> 02:09:00,020
Yeah.

2783
02:09:00,020 --> 02:09:06,140
So at this point, Harrison, I don't know exactly how it happens, maybe by way of images or

2784
02:09:06,140 --> 02:09:12,940
a video, but Harrison comes to the realization that this shooting is worse than he had realized.

2785
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:14,580
And this is not someone's arm.

2786
02:09:14,580 --> 02:09:16,060
Now we're not having fun.

2787
02:09:16,060 --> 02:09:21,740
The tone shifts dramatically and very, very noticeably.

2788
02:09:21,740 --> 02:09:27,340
And here we see the bloody stretcher and a woman, oh my gosh, oh my God, putting pressure

2789
02:09:27,340 --> 02:09:28,340
on a wound.

2790
02:09:28,340 --> 02:09:31,580
It looked like, we heard before she was shot in the arm, that looked like she was shot

2791
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:37,080
in the chest, perhaps the collarbone, but absolutely covered in blood as she's rushed

2792
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:39,500
away from the Capitol.

2793
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:44,140
This may be the first casualty of the second American revolution.

2794
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:48,520
This woman who is presumably, oh my God, and they're pumping her, wow, they're pumping

2795
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:49,840
her chest.

2796
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:52,820
That means she was most likely unresponsive.

2797
02:09:52,820 --> 02:09:58,500
That woman may have died or at least sustained a critical energy.

2798
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:02,580
So Harrison, I don't know if he knows how to handle a lot of this stuff.

2799
02:10:02,580 --> 02:10:08,700
This is pretty, this is tough because you've been spending your entire day sort of teasing

2800
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:15,580
people towards doing something like this, celebrating as it happens, and now the reality

2801
02:10:15,580 --> 02:10:19,880
that someone has been shot and is probably dead.

2802
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:20,880
It's tough.

2803
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:24,260
It's tough to cover all of that.

2804
02:10:24,260 --> 02:10:27,180
Especially when you're someone like Harrison who just doesn't have the skills.

2805
02:10:27,180 --> 02:10:34,980
It is in the real world, in his world, in the world that they all believe in, that should

2806
02:10:34,980 --> 02:10:37,900
be expected?

2807
02:10:37,900 --> 02:10:41,620
That should be an expected casualty of your fucking revolution?

2808
02:10:41,620 --> 02:10:45,260
Are you telling me, are you telling me that you think you're going to overthrow a fucking

2809
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:50,980
country and then you're going to get all wingy and sad when someone gets shot and dies?

2810
02:10:50,980 --> 02:10:51,980
Fuck off.

2811
02:10:51,980 --> 02:10:56,540
And I think there's some decent instincts on Harrison's part with saying like the first

2812
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:58,660
casualty of the American Revolution.

2813
02:10:58,660 --> 02:11:00,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2814
02:11:00,060 --> 02:11:01,060
That's what you should be saying.

2815
02:11:01,060 --> 02:11:03,900
That's him keeping it in the pocket of the patriot lore.

2816
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:04,900
Yeah, exactly.

2817
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:07,700
That he needs to build in real time in order to be profitable.

2818
02:11:07,700 --> 02:11:14,420
But at the same time, from an emotional standpoint and from a performance standpoint, I don't

2819
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:18,060
see him being able to keep up his character.

2820
02:11:18,060 --> 02:11:21,300
No, no, because it's a character.

2821
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:23,740
And because this is someone's dead.

2822
02:11:23,740 --> 02:11:25,560
I understand that somebody's dead.

2823
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:28,100
In the real world, that's a fucking tragedy.

2824
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:34,460
What I'm saying is that these people are imagining themselves as fucking revolutionaries, and

2825
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:39,600
then they all quit and cried because somebody died.

2826
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:44,700
You cannot scream 1776 at me and then be like, whoa, somebody got shot?

2827
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:45,700
Oh my god.

2828
02:11:45,700 --> 02:11:51,060
Well, I can explain Alex's angle on it much better as soon as he comes around.

2829
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:53,220
Harrison's a little bit more of a mystery to me.

2830
02:11:53,220 --> 02:11:57,460
And I think, I'm not entirely sure, I just don't think he's very good.

2831
02:11:57,460 --> 02:11:58,760
No, he sucks.

2832
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:01,220
He's supposed to be doing a job, but I just don't think he does it very well.

2833
02:12:01,220 --> 02:12:04,340
And that's why you gotta get Alex and Owen on the phone.

2834
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:05,340
Shit's getting real.

2835
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:06,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2836
02:12:06,340 --> 02:12:12,300
So they get on the phone, and Owen's trying to talk to Harrison, his good friend who saw

2837
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:13,300
him in that video.

2838
02:12:13,300 --> 02:12:14,300
You know, they're buddies.

2839
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:15,300
Yeah, yeah, they're great.

2840
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:19,980
Alex just keeps yelling in the background, contradicting the entire day's coverage.

2841
02:12:19,980 --> 02:12:20,980
Love it.

2842
02:12:20,980 --> 02:12:21,980
Dave, I'm on air right now.

2843
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:23,300
No, basically, okay.

2844
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:25,980
I want to get live, Dave, so I'm just hearing this story.

2845
02:12:25,980 --> 02:12:29,660
The city is going under martial law, we caught Antifa provocateurs, with witnesses and the

2846
02:12:29,660 --> 02:12:33,980
footage that first started the storming, but then triggered all this.

2847
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:37,020
So Alex is going to be breaking that down momentarily.

2848
02:12:37,020 --> 02:12:40,460
Yeah, in a moment Alex is going to be explaining that Antifa did all this.

2849
02:12:40,460 --> 02:12:41,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2850
02:12:41,460 --> 02:12:45,660
Because now we gotta figure out a way to not have any kind of involvement.

2851
02:12:45,660 --> 02:12:47,700
This is going to look bad.

2852
02:12:47,700 --> 02:12:50,620
We gotta thread this needle, baby.

2853
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:51,620
Aw, man.

2854
02:12:51,620 --> 02:12:52,620
Yep.

2855
02:12:52,620 --> 02:12:56,420
These white people are so fucking entitled, they think they're entitled to a revolution

2856
02:12:56,420 --> 02:12:58,300
without getting hurt.

2857
02:12:58,300 --> 02:12:59,300
Or looking bad.

2858
02:12:59,300 --> 02:13:00,300
Yeah, exactly.

2859
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:04,860
So Alex is decreeing in the background, yelling while Owen's on the phone, that they're going

2860
02:13:04,860 --> 02:13:05,860
commercial-free.

2861
02:13:05,860 --> 02:13:09,860
They can't go commercial-free on all shows, commercial-free.

2862
02:13:09,860 --> 02:13:13,980
I'm telling you folks, this is historic, they've declared basically martial law, they're sending

2863
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:18,900
in National Guard, it's absolutely insane, all because Antifa, the minute Trump announced

2864
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:24,580
he was going to come speak, Antifa, dressed up like patriots but with knee pads and arm

2865
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:27,740
pads, attacked the police to stage the triggered event.

2866
02:13:27,740 --> 02:13:31,020
So they triggered this stampede, we have the witnesses, we have the police.

2867
02:13:31,020 --> 02:13:34,780
I guess at this point he had taken the phone from Owen, which is probably smart.

2868
02:13:34,780 --> 02:13:37,660
It would be smart, because Owen clearly doesn't have the lines yet.

2869
02:13:37,660 --> 02:13:44,620
No, no, and Alex can just rattle off this narrative without anything.

2870
02:13:44,620 --> 02:13:48,780
No, no, and it could be a switch that he flips instantly and just be like, oh are we doing

2871
02:13:48,780 --> 02:13:49,780
Antifa now?

2872
02:13:49,780 --> 02:13:52,580
Okay, I'll switch to my Antifa rambling nonsense.

2873
02:13:52,580 --> 02:14:02,260
And if I have my timeline right, the National Guard definitely had not been at this point.

2874
02:14:02,260 --> 02:14:07,740
This is tough, because this is a direct contradiction of Harrison's narrative that he's been building

2875
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:11,840
for hours at this point, watching this event happen live.

2876
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:15,780
This is patriots who have righteous indignation, they've been pushed too far.

2877
02:14:15,780 --> 02:14:22,260
No it's not, it's Antifa provocateur-ing, and they're the ones who stormed things.

2878
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:26,260
The patriots were trying to keep it peaceful, they had not had enough, they could put up

2879
02:14:26,260 --> 02:14:27,260
with much more.

2880
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:28,260
God dammit.

2881
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:31,740
So now we have two completely contradictory narratives being sold.

2882
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:38,360
Now, Owen is on the same phone call with Alex, and he is there, he's contradicting Alex.

2883
02:14:38,360 --> 02:14:39,360
He's got number three?

2884
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:43,060
It's so tough to really put this into perspective, because here's the deal, we're not violent

2885
02:14:43,060 --> 02:14:49,220
revolutionaries, but they've taken our country, our country is occupied, and you can debate

2886
02:14:49,220 --> 02:14:54,220
all day long what the appropriate response is, the point is, we finally have a response,

2887
02:14:54,220 --> 02:14:58,620
and we haven't had any fight in our Congress, we haven't had any fight in our legislatures,

2888
02:14:58,620 --> 02:15:01,060
and so this is what's going to happen, is we the people are going to have to fight.

2889
02:15:01,060 --> 02:15:06,340
Again, we did not come here as violent revolutionaries, but the history is definitely being made right

2890
02:15:06,340 --> 02:15:07,340
now.

2891
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:12,100
I don't know if today is the turning point that will change the course of American history,

2892
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:15,460
but this is just the nexus of the beginning.

2893
02:15:15,460 --> 02:15:20,680
So this is a direct contradiction of Alex, he's closer to the narrative that Harrison

2894
02:15:20,680 --> 02:15:24,500
has been selling throughout the day, this is patriots who have had enough.

2895
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:30,220
Now the thing that I have a difficult time with is we can have different opinions about

2896
02:15:30,220 --> 02:15:35,100
I don't know whether pasta is good, like maybe you don't like it.

2897
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:36,100
Who, you and me?

2898
02:15:36,100 --> 02:15:37,100
Yeah, it's sort of an opinion.

2899
02:15:37,100 --> 02:15:38,100
We have different opinions.

2900
02:15:38,100 --> 02:15:40,300
Yeah, but we both agree that pasta exists.

2901
02:15:40,300 --> 02:15:44,180
I begrudgingly admit that, yes.

2902
02:15:44,180 --> 02:15:50,740
They have fundamental contradictions about the reality of what has happened and what

2903
02:15:50,740 --> 02:15:52,540
it means and everything.

2904
02:15:52,540 --> 02:15:58,220
These two things cannot coexist together, and they're asking their audience to believe

2905
02:15:58,220 --> 02:16:03,340
that it's just sort of a little disagreement that we have, sort of an interpretation thing.

2906
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:04,340
No, it's not.

2907
02:16:04,340 --> 02:16:05,340
No.

2908
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:06,340
It's very important.

2909
02:16:06,340 --> 02:16:12,380
There's something that's underappreciated about, I think the difference that we're seeing

2910
02:16:12,380 --> 02:16:20,500
between these and the Black Lives Matter protests is kind of built around the fact that all

2911
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:24,580
of these right wing ding dongs are fighting a different enemy.

2912
02:16:24,580 --> 02:16:29,540
Like they all have their own conception of the evil government, whether it's lizards

2913
02:16:29,540 --> 02:16:34,500
or anything, it's all completely different from the person standing next to them.

2914
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:39,580
They have same things they chant and same things they scream, but deep down they're

2915
02:16:39,580 --> 02:16:41,980
all fighting a different fight.

2916
02:16:41,980 --> 02:16:46,980
And in Portland, everybody was fighting the same singular fight.

2917
02:16:46,980 --> 02:16:47,980
Sure.

2918
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:52,900
And one of the things that I actually think is at the core of why I disagree with you

2919
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:57,520
about the nature of what happened on Wednesday, where you're saying they all looked stupid

2920
02:16:57,520 --> 02:16:59,960
and this is going to have a deflationary effect.

2921
02:16:59,960 --> 02:17:08,580
I look at this and I worry that the way that it will be used, this event, will be used

2922
02:17:08,580 --> 02:17:14,700
in the same way that things like Ruby Ridge and Waco were used in the 90s.

2923
02:17:14,700 --> 02:17:20,140
In the aftermath of those events, you had the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous, where you had

2924
02:17:20,140 --> 02:17:24,640
a bunch of different right wing extremist groups who also didn't see eye to eye about

2925
02:17:24,640 --> 02:17:26,400
what their enemy was.

2926
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:29,540
Some people thought it was just a big government.

2927
02:17:29,540 --> 02:17:32,380
Some people thought it was the Jews.

2928
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:36,140
And they all got together and were like, well, we got to work together.

2929
02:17:36,140 --> 02:17:41,900
And that is what emboldened and grew the militia right wing community in the 90s.

2930
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:49,060
I do worry that this will have a galvanizing effect, especially with you have a death that,

2931
02:17:49,060 --> 02:17:55,040
spoiler alert, is something that Alex is going to try and use to make a martyr out of.

2932
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:58,540
That is going to be the game that Alex ends up playing.

2933
02:17:58,540 --> 02:18:04,140
You have a lot of the essential elements that you would need to try and create this focal

2934
02:18:04,140 --> 02:18:11,260
point where you could get people of different, like, how could you get QAnon folks and Alex

2935
02:18:11,260 --> 02:18:14,020
to work side by side?

2936
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:20,060
Seems like this is something that we could reach detente over.

2937
02:18:20,060 --> 02:18:21,060
I get that.

2938
02:18:21,060 --> 02:18:22,060
I get that.

2939
02:18:22,060 --> 02:18:27,380
I think the difference for me between the Ruby Ridge and those examples that you've

2940
02:18:27,380 --> 02:18:34,140
given are that they were in response to an aggressor.

2941
02:18:34,140 --> 02:18:36,980
There were people coming at them as well.

2942
02:18:36,980 --> 02:18:43,100
It was not a, it was not a bunch of morons and the cops let them go.

2943
02:18:43,100 --> 02:18:44,340
There was a conflict.

2944
02:18:44,340 --> 02:18:45,340
We don't have time.

2945
02:18:45,340 --> 02:18:46,740
I know we're not going to do all that.

2946
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:52,740
No, we don't have time to get into all of that, but I will say that perception is what's

2947
02:18:52,740 --> 02:18:55,820
more important than reality in terms of Patriot lore.

2948
02:18:55,820 --> 02:18:56,820
I agree.

2949
02:18:56,820 --> 02:19:02,980
The stories that can be told can put people in the roles that they need to be in in order

2950
02:19:02,980 --> 02:19:08,100
to make the story that you would see as a bunch of losers going home and looking stupid

2951
02:19:08,100 --> 02:19:10,260
as being exactly what's needed.

2952
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:12,300
I will be interested to see how they do it.

2953
02:19:12,300 --> 02:19:15,140
I'm not saying that that is what's going to happen.

2954
02:19:15,140 --> 02:19:18,740
As I was seeing all this happen, that was the fear that I had.

2955
02:19:18,740 --> 02:19:25,100
That was the worry that I have about the pieces of this and the way that I see Alex responding

2956
02:19:25,100 --> 02:19:26,100
to it.

2957
02:19:26,100 --> 02:19:29,900
That is, is kind of, but I don't know.

2958
02:19:29,900 --> 02:19:30,900
We'll see.

2959
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:31,900
Yeah.

2960
02:19:31,900 --> 02:19:37,420
Anyway, um, everybody's contradicting each other in a way that is, um, it's just, it's,

2961
02:19:37,420 --> 02:19:38,420
it's incomprehensible.

2962
02:19:38,420 --> 02:19:42,820
If you're a listener, I guess you just gotta be on team Owen and Harrison or team Alex.

2963
02:19:42,820 --> 02:19:43,820
Yeah, whatever.

2964
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:44,820
Or whomever.

2965
02:19:44,820 --> 02:19:49,580
And now Harrison has realized that, uh, shit, someone got shot, probably dead.

2966
02:19:49,580 --> 02:19:50,860
Um, you know what?

2967
02:19:50,860 --> 02:19:53,340
These protesters, they were completely nonviolent.

2968
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:54,340
Get the fuck out.

2969
02:19:54,340 --> 02:19:59,900
That's the only violence I have seen perpetrated so far beyond, uh, you know, one or two punches

2970
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:03,100
in return for a punch thrown by a police officer.

2971
02:20:03,100 --> 02:20:07,040
The only violence I have seen has been the cold blooded point blank shooting of a woman

2972
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:11,980
in the chest by the capital city police rather.

2973
02:20:11,980 --> 02:20:12,980
Yeah.

2974
02:20:12,980 --> 02:20:13,980
That's the only violence.

2975
02:20:13,980 --> 02:20:20,180
Gone are the memories of people shooting fire extinguishers at cops, cops, cops, anytime

2976
02:20:20,180 --> 02:20:21,180
they punched.

2977
02:20:21,180 --> 02:20:24,580
Sure, they punched a cop, but that's not violence.

2978
02:20:24,580 --> 02:20:27,900
That's more like, you know, Oh, we're all tough guys here.

2979
02:20:27,900 --> 02:20:28,900
Yeah.

2980
02:20:28,900 --> 02:20:33,380
So now the entire tone has kind of changed for Harrison and he's in justification mode

2981
02:20:33,380 --> 02:20:37,140
and it's almost entirely for a long stretch of time.

2982
02:20:37,140 --> 02:20:43,060
Him talking about how the left gets to protest, protest against them, then you get shot.

2983
02:20:43,060 --> 02:20:44,700
The leftists are saying, just shoot them all.

2984
02:20:44,700 --> 02:20:48,160
You know, if you dare protest against us, we can protest, we can burn your city down

2985
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:49,160
for a year and a half.

2986
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:53,900
And just, you know, for a year, for four years, we can just, um, obstruct everything.

2987
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:54,900
We can destroy everything.

2988
02:20:54,900 --> 02:21:00,740
We can murder people in cold blood vice magazine will give us a, uh, a good 30 minute documentary

2989
02:21:00,740 --> 02:21:09,140
in order to call him racist and a bigot and a Nazi in order to justify his death.

2990
02:21:09,140 --> 02:21:12,600
That's the reaction you get if you are a protester on the left.

2991
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:14,140
This is really hollow for me.

2992
02:21:14,140 --> 02:21:18,380
Uh, but it seems to be like their mic drop moment because Harrison just keeps coming

2993
02:21:18,380 --> 02:21:20,940
back to that argument and it's just, I don't care.

2994
02:21:20,940 --> 02:21:21,940
Yeah.

2995
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:23,220
I get the fuck out of here.

2996
02:21:23,220 --> 02:21:28,900
Um, so he hears what Ted Cruz's response is and I think Harrison's a little bit surprised

2997
02:21:28,900 --> 02:21:33,020
to learn that Ted Cruz is not on board with this from Ted Cruz.

2998
02:21:33,020 --> 02:21:35,860
He says, quote, those storming in the Capitol need to stop.

2999
02:21:35,860 --> 02:21:39,900
Now the constitution protects peaceful protest, but violence from the left or right is always

3000
02:21:39,900 --> 02:21:40,900
wrong.

3001
02:21:40,900 --> 02:21:41,900
I've not seen any violence.

3002
02:21:41,900 --> 02:21:43,660
I've not seen any violence from the protesters yet.

3003
02:21:43,660 --> 02:21:44,660
Am I wrong?

3004
02:21:44,660 --> 02:21:47,500
And the crew tell me, have I seen, have I seen violence from the protesters?

3005
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:48,500
Yes, you have.

3006
02:21:48,500 --> 02:21:49,500
You've mentioned some of it.

3007
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:50,740
You commented on it earlier, sir.

3008
02:21:50,740 --> 02:21:52,180
And you were excited about it.

3009
02:21:52,180 --> 02:21:53,180
You were stoked.

3010
02:21:53,180 --> 02:21:54,180
Yeah.

3011
02:21:54,180 --> 02:21:55,180
In fact.

3012
02:21:55,180 --> 02:21:56,180
Weird.

3013
02:21:56,180 --> 02:21:57,180
Things change.

3014
02:21:57,180 --> 02:22:02,300
So, um, uh, speaking of things changing, uh, he, Harrison better fucking hope that some

3015
02:22:02,300 --> 02:22:06,740
of the people that he's talking about in this clip didn't do what he's saying they did.

3016
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:08,140
Cause if so, they're going to prison.

3017
02:22:08,140 --> 02:22:09,140
Oh no.

3018
02:22:09,140 --> 02:22:14,020
Uh, the people who have been able to successfully break into, uh, Senate offices and congressional

3019
02:22:14,020 --> 02:22:20,120
offices, uh, did so with such swiftness that the protesters there were, or the, I'm sorry,

3020
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:26,140
the, uh, the staffers and congressmen and senators there were unable to even grab their

3021
02:22:26,140 --> 02:22:29,660
information, grab their papers or even shut down their computers.

3022
02:22:29,660 --> 02:22:35,300
So now unlocked and open to anybody, those computers are being accessed by the protesters

3023
02:22:35,300 --> 02:22:40,340
who themselves are gathering information, downloading hard drives or stealing the hard

3024
02:22:40,340 --> 02:22:41,340
drives outright.

3025
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:46,380
Uh, we can expect to see the fallout from this continue on for a very long time.

3026
02:22:46,380 --> 02:22:53,540
But I remind you again, after a year of complete chaos, a year of protest, a year of literally

3027
02:22:53,540 --> 02:22:58,960
tens of thousands of violent riots, I'm not saying, I'm not saying that it's impossible

3028
02:22:58,960 --> 02:23:03,820
that, uh, some people took some stuff or might've accessed some stuff, but like that was, that's

3029
02:23:03,820 --> 02:23:06,420
a very serious, like national security problem.

3030
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:08,620
That's a, that's a sitcom plot.

3031
02:23:08,620 --> 02:23:11,240
That's something that I don't think that people will take lightly.

3032
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:15,740
What did, what did Chandler bring home from the White House?

3033
02:23:15,740 --> 02:23:18,660
Uh oh, it's the governor's fucking hard drive.

3034
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:19,660
Oh no.

3035
02:23:19,660 --> 02:23:23,300
It's, uh, yeah, Schumer's motherboard.

3036
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:24,300
What are we going to do?

3037
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:25,780
We got to get rid of it.

3038
02:23:25,780 --> 02:23:26,780
Yeah.

3039
02:23:26,780 --> 02:23:32,860
It'd be good to like, if these fucking ding dongs didn't live stream themselves without

3040
02:23:32,860 --> 02:23:33,860
masks on.

3041
02:23:33,860 --> 02:23:34,860
I know.

3042
02:23:34,860 --> 02:23:39,620
Going into these offices where allegedly they are stealing, uh, maybe, uh, privileged or

3043
02:23:39,620 --> 02:23:40,960
classified information.

3044
02:23:40,960 --> 02:23:47,220
It's a good thing that they decided to storm one of the least heavily surveilled buildings,

3045
02:23:47,220 --> 02:23:49,020
uh, without masks on.

3046
02:23:49,020 --> 02:23:50,020
Yeah.

3047
02:23:50,020 --> 02:23:54,180
You know, that Capitol building, I'm glad they just don't have many cameras there or

3048
02:23:54,180 --> 02:23:59,820
recording equipment of any kind to, to like, the perfect heist.

3049
02:23:59,820 --> 02:24:09,800
Anyway, were they filming, was George Clooney there?

3050
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:13,260
Is this like a Jimmy Fallon in that Boston movie?

3051
02:24:13,260 --> 02:24:15,540
It's Pawns 11.

3052
02:24:15,540 --> 02:24:22,340
So at this point, Alex has suggested that it's Antifa that is orchestrating or provocateering

3053
02:24:22,340 --> 02:24:26,460
all of this, but Harrison is, this is still real to him, man.

3054
02:24:26,460 --> 02:24:31,740
We have heard time and time again how valuable protests are, how good protests are, how Antifa

3055
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:36,940
is only an idea, how Black Lives Matter is simply a set of beliefs that if you don't

3056
02:24:36,940 --> 02:24:42,340
believe you're racist, uh, and we've watched silently because we always knew that the end

3057
02:24:42,340 --> 02:24:43,740
of the day, we had our vote.

3058
02:24:43,740 --> 02:24:48,260
We always knew that when it came right down to it, the American system was powerful enough,

3059
02:24:48,260 --> 02:24:50,920
flexible enough.

3060
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:52,820
Is that what you guys were talking about?

3061
02:24:52,820 --> 02:24:55,320
To voting, maintain.

3062
02:24:55,320 --> 02:25:02,460
And we knew that if we just trusted and exerted our rights as members of a Republican citizens

3063
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:07,940
of this democracy, that we could regain our footing and get back on track.

3064
02:25:07,940 --> 02:25:10,160
Well, that vote has been stolen from us.

3065
02:25:10,160 --> 02:25:16,660
If you're wondering what is inspiring the overwhelming, um, activity that we're seeing

3066
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:21,780
here on violent activity, some supporters move into the Capitol building and start to

3067
02:25:21,780 --> 02:25:27,920
destroy things, uh, it's that that last release valve has been taken, destroyed, perverted

3068
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:35,500
and prevented from being accessed and used by the people who for so long have patiently

3069
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:38,860
stood by and watched their country literally burned around them.

3070
02:25:38,860 --> 02:25:43,060
So I guess it wasn't Antifa provocateur-ing things, I guess it was that people had their

3071
02:25:43,060 --> 02:25:46,760
right to vote stolen and they'd had enough and this is the only thing that could remedy

3072
02:25:46,760 --> 02:25:47,760
that.

3073
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:52,040
Yeah, but it was Antifa who exploited that to make them do things that they didn't want

3074
02:25:52,040 --> 02:25:55,500
to do, even though the things that they did are the things that they did want to do.

3075
02:25:55,500 --> 02:26:01,140
I bet, I bet, like, if pushed Alex might be able to come up with that, but that's not

3076
02:26:01,140 --> 02:26:02,140
what he said.

3077
02:26:02,140 --> 02:26:03,540
I don't think you can sell that one.

3078
02:26:03,540 --> 02:26:11,700
So this next clip is really where I found myself saying, oh, Alex, oh no, um, this is

3079
02:26:11,700 --> 02:26:16,620
sad, um, this is really indicative of how Alex operates.

3080
02:26:16,620 --> 02:26:21,460
Mike down for this because Owen's going to talk about this shooting and he listened to

3081
02:26:21,460 --> 02:26:23,980
Alex's response.

3082
02:26:23,980 --> 02:26:26,660
People apparently have been shot inside the Capitol.

3083
02:26:26,660 --> 02:26:28,780
Now we're still getting intel on what that is.

3084
02:26:28,780 --> 02:26:33,220
We've gotten to a safe location because it was just too crazy out there on the streets.

3085
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:34,940
But that was Capitol police.

3086
02:26:34,940 --> 02:26:35,940
That's probably false.

3087
02:26:35,940 --> 02:26:36,940
That's the left.

3088
02:26:36,940 --> 02:26:38,940
Probably we're going to get later and the intel is probably false.

3089
02:26:38,940 --> 02:26:39,940
What's false?

3090
02:26:39,940 --> 02:26:40,940
The shooting inside.

3091
02:26:40,940 --> 02:26:44,420
Well, there was, I mean, a woman came out in a gurney bleeding, so I don't know who,

3092
02:26:44,420 --> 02:26:45,420
we don't know who did it.

3093
02:26:45,420 --> 02:26:46,500
Point is, it's crazy.

3094
02:26:46,500 --> 02:26:53,140
Point is, there's video now of the shooting having taken place.

3095
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:58,420
So Alex, based on nothing, his response is that's probably fake.

3096
02:26:58,420 --> 02:26:59,420
Probably fake.

3097
02:26:59,420 --> 02:27:01,020
This shooting is probably fake.

3098
02:27:01,020 --> 02:27:03,100
Alex, I saw somebody going out there with a girl.

3099
02:27:03,100 --> 02:27:05,540
I'm just throwing that out there in case you want to use that later.

3100
02:27:05,540 --> 02:27:06,540
It's probably fake.

3101
02:27:06,540 --> 02:27:07,540
Things are crazy.

3102
02:27:07,540 --> 02:27:08,540
Just in case you were wondering, probably fake.

3103
02:27:08,540 --> 02:27:10,360
And Harrison has to come in and be like, there's video.

3104
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:12,340
You can't, you can't deny this.

3105
02:27:12,340 --> 02:27:13,500
That's fake.

3106
02:27:13,500 --> 02:27:14,560
That's just random.

3107
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:15,560
That's knee jerk.

3108
02:27:15,560 --> 02:27:16,560
He's basing that on nothing.

3109
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:17,560
Just anything.

3110
02:27:17,560 --> 02:27:18,560
That is just.

3111
02:27:18,560 --> 02:27:19,560
That makes us look bad.

3112
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:22,060
Let's say it's fake first and let's just see if we can get away with it.

3113
02:27:22,060 --> 02:27:23,060
Let's see how it feels.

3114
02:27:23,060 --> 02:27:24,060
Yeah.

3115
02:27:24,060 --> 02:27:25,060
Yeah.

3116
02:27:25,060 --> 02:27:26,060
Yeah.

3117
02:27:26,060 --> 02:27:27,060
Let's taste it in our mouths a little bit.

3118
02:27:27,060 --> 02:27:29,780
So he has been now refuted by both of his employees.

3119
02:27:29,780 --> 02:27:30,780
Yeah.

3120
02:27:30,780 --> 02:27:31,780
Yeah.

3121
02:27:31,780 --> 02:27:32,780
Alex, no.

3122
02:27:32,780 --> 02:27:33,780
Who are not getting the lines.

3123
02:27:33,780 --> 02:27:34,780
We cannot do that.

3124
02:27:34,780 --> 02:27:35,820
They are not getting the lines.

3125
02:27:35,820 --> 02:27:37,820
There's video.

3126
02:27:37,820 --> 02:27:38,820
Can't fight that.

3127
02:27:38,820 --> 02:27:42,080
So Alex makes up another detail.

3128
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:45,980
So now Pence has also betrayed President Donald Trump.

3129
02:27:45,980 --> 02:27:52,340
So Trump is now a man on a, on a mountain by himself and he has we the people fighting

3130
02:27:52,340 --> 02:27:53,340
for him.

3131
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:56,820
By the way, the police just confirmed one woman was shot in the leg inside the Capitol.

3132
02:27:56,820 --> 02:27:58,780
Alex is making up that confirmation.

3133
02:27:58,780 --> 02:28:00,540
He didn't get that confirmation from anybody.

3134
02:28:00,540 --> 02:28:01,540
No.

3135
02:28:01,540 --> 02:28:02,540
She didn't get shot in the leg.

3136
02:28:02,540 --> 02:28:07,780
That, he's just making that up because he has to, he has to admit that someone got shot

3137
02:28:07,780 --> 02:28:12,260
and it's not fake because of the pushback that he got from his employees, but he can't

3138
02:28:12,260 --> 02:28:15,680
let it be as serious as it looks like it might be.

3139
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:16,940
So it's someone was shot in the leg.

3140
02:28:16,940 --> 02:28:19,060
And he can't also just say he was wrong.

3141
02:28:19,060 --> 02:28:21,460
He has to say, I got word that it was confirmed.

3142
02:28:21,460 --> 02:28:22,460
Yes.

3143
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:23,460
Yes.

3144
02:28:23,460 --> 02:28:24,460
It's all made up.

3145
02:28:24,460 --> 02:28:25,460
Yep.

3146
02:28:25,460 --> 02:28:30,460
So Alex has decided that this is Antifa and he explains his evidence for this.

3147
02:28:30,460 --> 02:28:33,660
And when I say evidence, I'm being incredibly generous.

3148
02:28:33,660 --> 02:28:34,660
Okay.

3149
02:28:34,660 --> 02:28:38,660
I would describe this as a, he imagined that it was Antifa.

3150
02:28:38,660 --> 02:28:39,660
Okay.

3151
02:28:39,660 --> 02:28:43,300
Folks saw him militarily come in, a lot of vets were over here and they said, yeah, they

3152
02:28:43,300 --> 02:28:44,300
were very military.

3153
02:28:44,300 --> 02:28:47,420
My elbow pads and knee pads kind of gray outfits.

3154
02:28:47,420 --> 02:28:50,260
They came in, attacked the riot police and said, let's go, let's do it.

3155
02:28:50,260 --> 02:28:51,820
Got some people to follow them.

3156
02:28:51,820 --> 02:28:55,780
Then they all pulled out real quick and I ran to a bunch of experts who were witnesses

3157
02:28:55,780 --> 02:28:56,780
to what else happened.

3158
02:28:56,780 --> 02:29:00,260
But as soon as I saw the footage, Trump had just announced, I'm going to drive in 20 minutes

3159
02:29:00,260 --> 02:29:04,860
over there from his big rally for a peaceful protest here at the Capitol within minutes

3160
02:29:04,860 --> 02:29:05,860
of that.

3161
02:29:05,860 --> 02:29:06,860
Everybody's like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3162
02:29:06,860 --> 02:29:08,260
People are attacking the police.

3163
02:29:08,260 --> 02:29:09,540
All this crazy stuff's happening.

3164
02:29:09,540 --> 02:29:11,140
All this crazy stuff's going down.

3165
02:29:11,140 --> 02:29:13,780
All this crazy stuff's unfolding.

3166
02:29:13,780 --> 02:29:16,220
And then boom, I was like, man, they're going to do provocateur action.

3167
02:29:16,220 --> 02:29:19,640
And sure enough minutes later that happened 95% of provocateur.

3168
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:20,640
We have the witnesses.

3169
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:21,640
We have the footage.

3170
02:29:21,640 --> 02:29:22,640
We have so much.

3171
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:23,640
We have the witness footage.

3172
02:29:23,640 --> 02:29:24,640
We have the witnesses.

3173
02:29:24,640 --> 02:29:25,640
We have the witnesses.

3174
02:29:25,640 --> 02:29:26,640
We have the footage.

3175
02:29:26,640 --> 02:29:27,640
We have the witness footage.

3176
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:29,060
We got it all.

3177
02:29:29,060 --> 02:29:31,220
We got all three kinds of footage.

3178
02:29:31,220 --> 02:29:35,020
Alex is basically just saying, Hey, I thought that they might do a provocateur thing.

3179
02:29:35,020 --> 02:29:36,020
So they did.

3180
02:29:36,020 --> 02:29:37,020
They did.

3181
02:29:37,020 --> 02:29:38,020
They totally did.

3182
02:29:38,020 --> 02:29:39,020
I proved it.

3183
02:29:39,020 --> 02:29:40,020
Aha.

3184
02:29:40,020 --> 02:29:41,020
We saw it.

3185
02:29:41,020 --> 02:29:42,020
There's this guy.

3186
02:29:42,020 --> 02:29:43,020
He was dressed.

3187
02:29:43,020 --> 02:29:44,020
It's amazing how good Antifa is.

3188
02:29:44,020 --> 02:29:46,540
He was dressed exactly like you would expect somebody at this rally to be dressed.

3189
02:29:46,540 --> 02:29:50,980
He was screaming things that like, I screamed, so you know that he was Antifa because they

3190
02:29:50,980 --> 02:29:52,260
wouldn't say the things that I say.

3191
02:29:52,260 --> 02:29:56,220
We all know that the Antifa is mostly out of work theater students.

3192
02:29:56,220 --> 02:29:57,220
And they are so good.

3193
02:29:57,220 --> 02:29:58,220
They're good at acting.

3194
02:29:58,220 --> 02:30:00,980
This guy even had a Nazi tattoo on his neck.

3195
02:30:00,980 --> 02:30:03,100
How good is Antifa at provocateuring?

3196
02:30:03,100 --> 02:30:04,100
We know that was a stick-on.

3197
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:09,340
Amazing how good they are at mimicking their infiltrators.

3198
02:30:09,340 --> 02:30:12,260
So one of the things that was jarring about this is they kind of go back and forth from

3199
02:30:12,260 --> 02:30:17,540
Harrison doing some reporting and Alex doing his yelling.

3200
02:30:17,540 --> 02:30:23,500
And so Harrison, you know, I would say one of the most important things in a situation

3201
02:30:23,500 --> 02:30:27,700
like this is not to just say anything on air.

3202
02:30:27,700 --> 02:30:33,860
When you have a tense situation and you have a lot of information coming in, some of it

3203
02:30:33,860 --> 02:30:34,860
might be wrong.

3204
02:30:34,860 --> 02:30:35,860
Yeah.

3205
02:30:35,860 --> 02:30:36,860
You might want to vet some things.

3206
02:30:36,860 --> 02:30:37,860
Right.

3207
02:30:37,860 --> 02:30:41,620
I understand that there's an impulse to report everything as quickly as you can.

3208
02:30:41,620 --> 02:30:45,500
Sometimes it's best to take a breath and wait a little while.

3209
02:30:45,500 --> 02:30:47,180
Harrison is from a different school.

3210
02:30:47,180 --> 02:30:48,180
Oh, okay.

3211
02:30:48,180 --> 02:30:52,620
This is unconfirmed, but it does say that protesters are engaging U.S. Secret Service

3212
02:30:52,620 --> 02:30:54,620
hand-to-hand combat.

3213
02:30:54,620 --> 02:30:55,620
Okay.

3214
02:30:55,620 --> 02:30:56,620
Unconfirmed.

3215
02:30:56,620 --> 02:31:00,540
I'm not sure if that's a troll post or not.

3216
02:31:00,540 --> 02:31:05,380
Usually not good on your news outlet to read something and then afterwards when you sound

3217
02:31:05,380 --> 02:31:09,900
stupid coming out of your mouth, like, ah, that might be trolling.

3218
02:31:09,900 --> 02:31:13,540
Ladies and gentlemen, I am just getting word that Olympus has fallen.

3219
02:31:13,540 --> 02:31:15,580
Oh wait, no, that might be a troll.

3220
02:31:15,580 --> 02:31:21,380
Oh wait, earlier I did say that the Capitol is fallen.

3221
02:31:21,380 --> 02:31:22,380
Well there's that.

3222
02:31:22,380 --> 02:31:24,700
That might've been trolling.

3223
02:31:24,700 --> 02:31:26,180
So anyway, back to Alex yelling.

3224
02:31:26,180 --> 02:31:30,300
Look, there's a communist Chinese takeover with the new world order of the country.

3225
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:31,300
They're trying to steal the election.

3226
02:31:31,300 --> 02:31:32,300
They're trying to bankrupt the nation.

3227
02:31:32,300 --> 02:31:34,300
They're telling us the country shouldn't even exist.

3228
02:31:34,300 --> 02:31:36,420
They're telling us the word mother and father can't exist.

3229
02:31:36,420 --> 02:31:39,660
This is a communist takeover and everybody knows it.

3230
02:31:39,660 --> 02:31:43,940
And South America is starting to push back and GGP and everybody else needs to know you're

3231
02:31:43,940 --> 02:31:45,660
the one starting all this, not us.

3232
02:31:45,660 --> 02:31:48,900
And you're the ones that are going to pay just like Hitler and just like all the rest

3233
02:31:48,900 --> 02:31:49,900
of scumbags.

3234
02:31:49,900 --> 02:31:52,160
And you know, this is, this is what happens.

3235
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:53,160
This is the result.

3236
02:31:53,160 --> 02:31:57,060
This is like if you don't, if you don't deal with a cancer and you have cancer and you

3237
02:31:57,060 --> 02:32:00,460
don't deal with it until it's too late, they basically only have one shot and that's just

3238
02:32:00,460 --> 02:32:04,780
a chemotherapy radiate the hell out of you and then hope you can survive.

3239
02:32:04,780 --> 02:32:05,780
That's what we're going through.

3240
02:32:05,780 --> 02:32:09,100
We've had a cancer in this country for decades.

3241
02:32:09,100 --> 02:32:12,140
We've had a communist Chinese takeover for decades.

3242
02:32:12,140 --> 02:32:16,900
We've been occupied by tyrants for decades and we've been ignoring it.

3243
02:32:16,900 --> 02:32:17,900
Whoa.

3244
02:32:17,900 --> 02:32:18,900
That's pretty severe.

3245
02:32:18,900 --> 02:32:19,900
Yeah.

3246
02:32:19,900 --> 02:32:25,100
I mean, we're at a point now where they have no reason to be like gung ho about this.

3247
02:32:25,100 --> 02:32:26,420
Everyone's backed off, buddy.

3248
02:32:26,420 --> 02:32:27,420
Yeah.

3249
02:32:27,420 --> 02:32:28,420
Yeah.

3250
02:32:28,420 --> 02:32:30,780
Um, yeah, it's, uh, it's, it's troubling.

3251
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:32,340
What a bunch of idiots.

3252
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:33,340
Yeah.

3253
02:32:33,340 --> 02:32:38,980
This is, they, this is how it was going to go.

3254
02:32:38,980 --> 02:32:42,540
How is this taking them by so, so much surprise?

3255
02:32:42,540 --> 02:32:48,820
Well, I think that they're used to acting in ways that would conceivably lead to something

3256
02:32:48,820 --> 02:32:51,620
like this, uh, and then it never happens.

3257
02:32:51,620 --> 02:32:55,060
And so I think that they're pretty used to that outcome.

3258
02:32:55,060 --> 02:32:59,860
And so it's kind of surprising to be, uh, the stars have aligned in such a way that

3259
02:32:59,860 --> 02:33:04,100
the other influences are actually making this happen.

3260
02:33:04,100 --> 02:33:07,780
Oh, um, I don't know if they, they know how to, uh, to react.

3261
02:33:07,780 --> 02:33:09,840
And that's why I think you see a little bit of flailing.

3262
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:14,300
You see, um, contradictory narratives being thrown out.

3263
02:33:14,300 --> 02:33:18,500
You have Alex trying to insist it's Antifa, but then at the same time, that last clip

3264
02:33:18,500 --> 02:33:21,260
seemed to sound like he was saying it's great.

3265
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:22,260
Yeah.

3266
02:33:22,260 --> 02:33:23,260
I don't know.

3267
02:33:23,260 --> 02:33:24,260
It's, it's weird.

3268
02:33:24,260 --> 02:33:28,420
I think it's because the only thing they're not allowed to say is the only thing that

3269
02:33:28,420 --> 02:33:32,660
would make any sense for any of them to say, which is just, you guys weren't supposed to

3270
02:33:32,660 --> 02:33:34,780
actually do it.

3271
02:33:34,780 --> 02:33:35,780
Yeah.

3272
02:33:35,780 --> 02:33:37,980
This was about stealing your money.

3273
02:33:37,980 --> 02:33:38,980
Yeah.

3274
02:33:38,980 --> 02:33:40,380
And now look at us.

3275
02:33:40,380 --> 02:33:41,540
This is tough for business.

3276
02:33:41,540 --> 02:33:43,820
I'm disappointed in you.

3277
02:33:43,820 --> 02:33:44,820
Yeah.

3278
02:33:44,820 --> 02:33:45,820
Yeah.

3279
02:33:45,820 --> 02:33:47,500
I it's, it's, it's weird.

3280
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:52,280
So in order to really thread the needle successfully, one of the things you have to do is cast dispersions

3281
02:33:52,280 --> 02:33:55,500
on the people who actually did follow through with it.

3282
02:33:55,500 --> 02:34:00,820
So there are people who have speculated that the Q shaman, a weirdo guy.

3283
02:34:00,820 --> 02:34:02,620
He was a agent.

3284
02:34:02,620 --> 02:34:03,620
He was Antifa.

3285
02:34:03,620 --> 02:34:06,060
Yeah, come on buddy.

3286
02:34:06,060 --> 02:34:07,540
Who else is Antifa?

3287
02:34:07,540 --> 02:34:08,540
Give him more names.

3288
02:34:08,540 --> 02:34:10,500
Uh, people are now in vet.

3289
02:34:10,500 --> 02:34:17,080
Now looking into some of the people that have broken in, they're seeing a look suspiciously

3290
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:24,140
like a communist, uh, communist things we're seeing, uh, it was incredible shots from inside

3291
02:34:24,140 --> 02:34:25,140
the Capitol dome.

3292
02:34:25,140 --> 02:34:28,720
So there's a guy who had a tattoo that everyone thought was a hammer and a sickle and it turns

3293
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:30,900
out it's a symbol from like a video game dishonored.

3294
02:34:30,900 --> 02:34:34,180
Um, so they were like, oh, he's a commie.

3295
02:34:34,180 --> 02:34:35,900
He can't actually, this isn't really.

3296
02:34:35,900 --> 02:34:36,900
Yeah.

3297
02:34:36,900 --> 02:34:40,020
Oh, so he had Corvo's little tattoo on his hand.

3298
02:34:40,020 --> 02:34:41,020
What a nerd.

3299
02:34:41,020 --> 02:34:42,020
Dorks.

3300
02:34:42,020 --> 02:34:43,020
That's so funny.

3301
02:34:43,020 --> 02:34:47,820
Um, and yeah, but Nick Fuentes and Baked Alaska are figures.

3302
02:34:47,820 --> 02:34:49,420
They're media figures.

3303
02:34:49,420 --> 02:34:50,900
They were on your show.

3304
02:34:50,900 --> 02:34:51,900
Yes.

3305
02:34:51,900 --> 02:34:53,900
Nick Fuentes was on like a week ago.

3306
02:34:53,900 --> 02:34:55,280
He was on a week ago.

3307
02:34:55,280 --> 02:34:57,280
He was with you the last time you were in DC.

3308
02:34:57,280 --> 02:34:59,280
Was he Antifa then or now?

3309
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:00,280
Pick one.

3310
02:35:00,280 --> 02:35:01,280
Yeah.

3311
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:02,280
Yeah.

3312
02:35:02,280 --> 02:35:03,280
They just conveniently ignore that.

3313
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:04,280
Jesus.

3314
02:35:04,280 --> 02:35:05,280
What a bunch.

3315
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:06,280
Is he, he's going to be back on Infowars, right?

3316
02:35:06,280 --> 02:35:07,280
Probably today.

3317
02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:09,020
They're going to have to get Fuentes on soon.

3318
02:35:09,020 --> 02:35:11,180
I don't know what happened on Thursday.

3319
02:35:11,180 --> 02:35:12,180
Yeah.

3320
02:35:12,180 --> 02:35:15,940
We're keeping this as a bottle episode of Wednesday and then on Monday we'll cover.

3321
02:35:15,940 --> 02:35:16,940
We'll go from there.

3322
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:17,940
Yeah.

3323
02:35:17,940 --> 02:35:18,940
Yeah.

3324
02:35:18,940 --> 02:35:21,100
Just because of the stupidity of all this.

3325
02:35:21,100 --> 02:35:22,100
So stupid.

3326
02:35:22,100 --> 02:35:25,940
Um, but yeah, I would assume that at least by the time the weekend's over, Fuentes will

3327
02:35:25,940 --> 02:35:31,260
have made some sort of a play for Harrison's job.

3328
02:35:31,260 --> 02:35:39,380
Anyway, we end the Alex Jones show and we end up going into the war room.

3329
02:35:39,380 --> 02:35:40,380
Smooth transition.

3330
02:35:40,380 --> 02:35:41,380
Of course.

3331
02:35:41,380 --> 02:35:42,580
It's all hosted by Harrison Smith.

3332
02:35:42,580 --> 02:35:43,700
He has to leave.

3333
02:35:43,700 --> 02:35:44,700
He's done.

3334
02:35:44,700 --> 02:35:45,700
He's okay.

3335
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:46,700
He's tapped out.

3336
02:35:46,700 --> 02:35:47,700
He's had a long day.

3337
02:35:47,700 --> 02:35:48,700
Oh yeah.

3338
02:35:48,700 --> 02:35:51,800
He's, I mean, to be fair, he was on air for a long time.

3339
02:35:51,800 --> 02:35:52,800
Seven straight hours?

3340
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:58,740
He did hold up at least in terms of like not completely falling apart, which is faint praise,

3341
02:35:58,740 --> 02:35:59,740
but I'll give it to him.

3342
02:35:59,740 --> 02:36:00,740
I don't know.

3343
02:36:00,740 --> 02:36:01,740
I don't think I could do seven hours.

3344
02:36:01,740 --> 02:36:02,740
No.

3345
02:36:02,740 --> 02:36:03,860
I don't think I, absolutely not.

3346
02:36:03,860 --> 02:36:05,740
Especially this is an intense seven hours.

3347
02:36:05,740 --> 02:36:08,060
I don't think he did a good job, but he did a job.

3348
02:36:08,060 --> 02:36:09,060
Yeah.

3349
02:36:09,060 --> 02:36:11,260
So I would've, I would've been like, guys, we shouldn't be doing this.

3350
02:36:11,260 --> 02:36:12,700
This is not for us right now.

3351
02:36:12,700 --> 02:36:13,900
We got to stop.

3352
02:36:13,900 --> 02:36:19,500
Now what's really funny is that Alex, oh, and also, I mean, not to, not to add more

3353
02:36:19,500 --> 02:36:22,180
praise on, but like Alex had said, we're cutting commercials.

3354
02:36:22,180 --> 02:36:23,180
Yeah.

3355
02:36:23,180 --> 02:36:27,180
So he had no breaks for like the last, like basically the last hour that he's been on

3356
02:36:27,180 --> 02:36:28,180
air.

3357
02:36:28,180 --> 02:36:29,180
God damn.

3358
02:36:29,180 --> 02:36:30,180
But like, uh.

3359
02:36:30,180 --> 02:36:31,180
Fuck you boss.

3360
02:36:31,180 --> 02:36:33,180
Alex keeps saying, we're going to go into the fourth hour.

3361
02:36:33,180 --> 02:36:35,840
Meanwhile, they're in the fourth hour.

3362
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:37,420
They're about to start the war room.

3363
02:36:37,420 --> 02:36:40,220
He has no idea, but again, I could be.

3364
02:36:40,220 --> 02:36:44,620
Time zones and, and he's, it's, there's a revolution going on.

3365
02:36:44,620 --> 02:36:45,620
No, totally.

3366
02:36:45,620 --> 02:36:46,620
I get it.

3367
02:36:46,620 --> 02:36:47,620
Yeah.

3368
02:36:47,620 --> 02:36:49,660
It's a little bit funny because you can hear the producer's voice like war room.

3369
02:36:49,660 --> 02:36:50,660
Yeah.

3370
02:36:50,660 --> 02:36:53,260
But I'm not, you know, I would make that mistake.

3371
02:36:53,260 --> 02:36:54,260
Totally.

3372
02:36:54,260 --> 02:36:55,260
No, that's understandable.

3373
02:36:55,260 --> 02:36:56,260
For sure.

3374
02:36:56,260 --> 02:37:01,380
Now with the mistake I would not make is Tom for a violent revolution, Tom Papert is hosting

3375
02:37:01,380 --> 02:37:02,380
the war.

3376
02:37:02,380 --> 02:37:03,380
Oh, that was a big mistake.

3377
02:37:03,380 --> 02:37:04,380
And this guy sucks.

3378
02:37:04,380 --> 02:37:07,900
Um, he's pretty scary.

3379
02:37:07,900 --> 02:37:14,100
Uh, local news has reported that protesters have moved inside the Kansas, uh, uh, house

3380
02:37:14,100 --> 02:37:15,260
chambers as well.

3381
02:37:15,260 --> 02:37:19,580
I'm getting additional reports from Kentucky and Georgia that protesters are making their

3382
02:37:19,580 --> 02:37:22,980
way inside the state Capitol buildings.

3383
02:37:22,980 --> 02:37:28,620
What seems to have set this off of course is all of this happened mere seconds after

3384
02:37:28,620 --> 02:37:33,540
Mike Pence announced his ultimate betrayal of president Trump and said that he would

3385
02:37:33,540 --> 02:37:36,320
not fight for him in the electoral college.

3386
02:37:36,320 --> 02:37:40,540
So I would say that everybody has like real different vibe.

3387
02:37:40,540 --> 02:37:44,460
So that was because, so Pence is Antifa.

3388
02:37:44,460 --> 02:37:45,460
Yes.

3389
02:37:45,460 --> 02:37:47,220
He was the one who instigated this whole thing.

3390
02:37:47,220 --> 02:37:56,020
Well here, here's, here's the vibe I would say, yeah, Harrison is like, yay, no, yay.

3391
02:37:56,020 --> 02:37:57,020
That's where he's at.

3392
02:37:57,020 --> 02:37:58,020
All right.

3393
02:37:58,020 --> 02:38:02,340
He's watching this go down and he's like, this is the revolution, but he's also drastically

3394
02:38:02,340 --> 02:38:05,700
affected in a kind of human way about the fact that someone died.

3395
02:38:05,700 --> 02:38:06,700
That's true.

3396
02:38:06,700 --> 02:38:08,980
And it, it, it ruins a lot of the vibe.

3397
02:38:08,980 --> 02:38:10,340
It does hurt his feelings.

3398
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:11,340
Yeah.

3399
02:38:11,340 --> 02:38:13,740
Uh, Tom Papert wants everything to burn.

3400
02:38:13,740 --> 02:38:18,900
He does not think that he thinks this is great, but he also thinks that we need to do way

3401
02:38:18,900 --> 02:38:19,900
more.

3402
02:38:19,900 --> 02:38:20,900
Okay.

3403
02:38:20,900 --> 02:38:21,900
Good.

3404
02:38:21,900 --> 02:38:22,900
Good.

3405
02:38:22,900 --> 02:38:23,900
It's he's, he's much more acceleration.

3406
02:38:23,900 --> 02:38:24,900
All right, Tom.

3407
02:38:24,900 --> 02:38:29,420
And then Alex can't quite figure out if it's Antifa or if he's glad.

3408
02:38:29,420 --> 02:38:33,440
And Owen, I don't even know what the fuck he's on.

3409
02:38:33,440 --> 02:38:34,440
Listen to this shit.

3410
02:38:34,440 --> 02:38:36,220
Owen's talking to Tom Papert and like,

3411
02:38:36,220 --> 02:38:44,700
hundreds of police cars never did they did it never did they do this once this summer

3412
02:38:44,700 --> 02:38:48,740
when churches burned, buildings burned, businesses were looted.

3413
02:38:48,740 --> 02:38:52,420
You never saw a response like this once, never once.

3414
02:38:52,420 --> 02:38:54,660
Now you could, you could make an argument.

3415
02:38:54,660 --> 02:38:58,680
I would even listen to an argument that says, oh, this is the appropriate response for what's

3416
02:38:58,680 --> 02:38:59,680
happening today.

3417
02:38:59,680 --> 02:39:00,680
I would listen to that.

3418
02:39:00,680 --> 02:39:01,680
Great.

3419
02:39:01,680 --> 02:39:03,620
Cause that's the argument I would make.

3420
02:39:03,620 --> 02:39:06,700
It's the fucking Capitol building.

3421
02:39:06,700 --> 02:39:11,580
It's it's people storming the fucking Capitol building of the country.

3422
02:39:11,580 --> 02:39:16,260
So you could, you could make the argument that this is a very serious, real thing, much

3423
02:39:16,260 --> 02:39:19,500
more so than someone stealing stuff from target.

3424
02:39:19,500 --> 02:39:20,500
Yes.

3425
02:39:20,500 --> 02:39:21,620
And I would listen to that argument.

3426
02:39:21,620 --> 02:39:22,620
Convenient.

3427
02:39:22,620 --> 02:39:23,620
Cause that's the argument I would make.

3428
02:39:23,620 --> 02:39:24,620
Yeah.

3429
02:39:24,620 --> 02:39:25,620
Yeah.

3430
02:39:25,620 --> 02:39:27,460
Why would you tell me that you would listen to that argument?

3431
02:39:27,460 --> 02:39:33,580
Cause it's the argument that really hurts your, obviously, obviously now, Hey, look,

3432
02:39:33,580 --> 02:39:37,420
if you were to make the argument that this was real, I would agree with you.

3433
02:39:37,420 --> 02:39:38,420
Yeah.

3434
02:39:38,420 --> 02:39:39,420
But.

3435
02:39:39,420 --> 02:39:42,500
Now even so I would say that some of the police responses that we've seen over the course

3436
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:44,700
of the summer were pretty severe.

3437
02:39:44,700 --> 02:39:47,060
Oh no, no.

3438
02:39:47,060 --> 02:39:48,060
How so?

3439
02:39:48,060 --> 02:39:52,160
I don't, I don't want to get into a game with scale or playing that cause I don't actually

3440
02:39:52,160 --> 02:39:58,660
think that I would be the most credible source on that, but I would say that there was a

3441
02:39:58,660 --> 02:40:04,300
lot of police action against people before.

3442
02:40:04,300 --> 02:40:12,700
And also whatever they did in terms of defending the Capitol building, you kind of would see

3443
02:40:12,700 --> 02:40:15,060
it and be like, well, it's the Capitol building.

3444
02:40:15,060 --> 02:40:20,460
Hey, we can talk about how many, how there were almost no arrests and all of that stuff.

3445
02:40:20,460 --> 02:40:22,060
We can talk about that stuff.

3446
02:40:22,060 --> 02:40:28,940
But I think what's a more telling statistic is how many fucking casualties there were

3447
02:40:28,940 --> 02:40:30,300
far.

3448
02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:33,840
There were fewer people with broken hands like that type of shit.

3449
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:36,660
Those types of, Oh, I got shot in the face with a rubber bullet.

3450
02:40:36,660 --> 02:40:41,120
Oh, I got blood coming from my nose because I was hit by three fucking cops.

3451
02:40:41,120 --> 02:40:43,460
There was none of that shit going around.

3452
02:40:43,460 --> 02:40:47,180
It seems like there's less that I've heard of.

3453
02:40:47,180 --> 02:40:48,180
Yeah.

3454
02:40:48,180 --> 02:40:49,180
Yeah.

3455
02:40:49,180 --> 02:40:54,540
I mean, it's, it, it's tough because obviously I don't think that the police should be, you

3456
02:40:54,540 --> 02:40:55,540
know, or law enforcement.

3457
02:40:55,540 --> 02:40:59,420
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not in the business of saying like, yeah, what'd you expect?

3458
02:40:59,420 --> 02:41:00,620
I don't like that tone.

3459
02:41:00,620 --> 02:41:02,580
Oh no, absolutely not.

3460
02:41:02,580 --> 02:41:09,940
But had things gone differently over the summer and people had made it over that barricade

3461
02:41:09,940 --> 02:41:12,900
when they were around the white house, sure.

3462
02:41:12,900 --> 02:41:18,780
I would not have been super surprised if people got shot for trying to rush the white totally

3463
02:41:18,780 --> 02:41:19,860
100%.

3464
02:41:19,860 --> 02:41:24,600
I'm not saying that people should have been shot for rushing the Capitol building, but

3465
02:41:24,600 --> 02:41:29,600
I'm saying I, what I am saying is I am not surprised by any level of law enforcement

3466
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:35,940
response when it comes to the fucking Capitol or the white house or, or I just don't understand

3467
02:41:35,940 --> 02:41:37,540
why they're playing games with that.

3468
02:41:37,540 --> 02:41:43,480
I think, I think that's one of the reasons that I'm just not as, uh, I, okay.

3469
02:41:43,480 --> 02:41:48,700
When you, when Portland happened, you had fucking stormtroopers against people.

3470
02:41:48,700 --> 02:41:53,100
And the pictures that came out were all in the middle of the night and everybody looked

3471
02:41:53,100 --> 02:41:54,400
fucking cool.

3472
02:41:54,400 --> 02:41:55,940
The cops looked cool.

3473
02:41:55,940 --> 02:41:59,000
They looked like the fucking beasts from movies.

3474
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:00,600
They looked so strong.

3475
02:42:00,600 --> 02:42:03,660
And the protesters, they were the protesters from movies.

3476
02:42:03,660 --> 02:42:05,060
They looked so strong.

3477
02:42:05,060 --> 02:42:09,980
And in this one we have cops standing around going like, Hey, what are you guys doing?

3478
02:42:09,980 --> 02:42:12,720
We just got to let you guys get this out of your system.

3479
02:42:12,720 --> 02:42:14,580
And we have idiots storming.

3480
02:42:14,580 --> 02:42:19,400
We have people fucking putting their feet up on Nancy Pelosi's fucking desk.

3481
02:42:19,400 --> 02:42:20,900
Some people might think that's pretty cool.

3482
02:42:20,900 --> 02:42:23,660
It is cool, but it's also pathetic and stupid.

3483
02:42:23,660 --> 02:42:27,540
I think, I think you're coming at this from a very subjective standpoint.

3484
02:42:27,540 --> 02:42:28,540
I understand.

3485
02:42:28,540 --> 02:42:29,540
I'm just saying.

3486
02:42:29,540 --> 02:42:32,660
You have a particular view of what's cool and what kind of movies you like.

3487
02:42:32,660 --> 02:42:35,300
No, no, that's, but they do too.

3488
02:42:35,300 --> 02:42:39,480
These are people that are, that guy has a Corvo tattoo, Dan.

3489
02:42:39,480 --> 02:42:42,720
These are all people who live in fucking fantasy movies.

3490
02:42:42,720 --> 02:42:44,740
That's the guy who's hanging out with the shaman.

3491
02:42:44,740 --> 02:42:50,100
Alex is their leader and he is, you know, like they're, these are all fucking sci-fi

3492
02:42:50,100 --> 02:42:51,100
nerds.

3493
02:42:51,100 --> 02:42:52,100
That is, that is true.

3494
02:42:52,100 --> 02:42:57,100
It does seem like there's a lot of, yeah, that, um, but look, the bottom line is this

3495
02:42:57,100 --> 02:42:58,100
was Antifa.

3496
02:42:58,100 --> 02:42:59,100
Yeah.

3497
02:42:59,100 --> 02:43:00,100
Okay.

3498
02:43:00,100 --> 02:43:01,100
Alex.

3499
02:43:01,100 --> 02:43:02,100
Alex is pretty sure of that.

3500
02:43:02,100 --> 02:43:03,100
Okay.

3501
02:43:03,100 --> 02:43:04,100
He's pretty much sure.

3502
02:43:04,100 --> 02:43:05,100
Antifa started this.

3503
02:43:05,100 --> 02:43:08,300
We're pretty much sure they're all wearing the same outfits, shoulder pads, knee pads,

3504
02:43:08,300 --> 02:43:09,300
mask.

3505
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:10,300
Ooh.

3506
02:43:10,300 --> 02:43:11,300
The people are pissed.

3507
02:43:11,300 --> 02:43:12,300
They got them up there.

3508
02:43:12,300 --> 02:43:15,340
A few people broke in, went in, could have arrested them, could have tasered them.

3509
02:43:15,340 --> 02:43:16,340
Shouldn't have shot that woman.

3510
02:43:16,340 --> 02:43:18,820
So they've already committed the big crime there.

3511
02:43:18,820 --> 02:43:23,780
This does not need to escalate and we need to have our path to victory by exposing the

3512
02:43:23,780 --> 02:43:26,700
fraudulent election with the massive evidence that came out.

3513
02:43:26,700 --> 02:43:34,060
So Alex is really at like a point where he's like, let's deescalate and I honestly kind

3514
02:43:34,060 --> 02:43:35,060
of get it.

3515
02:43:35,060 --> 02:43:37,060
I get, I get his perspective.

3516
02:43:37,060 --> 02:43:39,980
I mean, not because I agree.

3517
02:43:39,980 --> 02:43:40,980
I do agree.

3518
02:43:40,980 --> 02:43:41,980
There should have been deescalation.

3519
02:43:41,980 --> 02:43:42,980
Sure.

3520
02:43:42,980 --> 02:43:43,980
Sure.

3521
02:43:43,980 --> 02:43:44,980
Sure.

3522
02:43:44,980 --> 02:43:45,980
Sure.

3523
02:43:45,980 --> 02:43:46,980
But I get where he's coming from and it became very clear as I listened on.

3524
02:43:46,980 --> 02:43:47,980
What did that cap do?

3525
02:43:47,980 --> 02:43:48,980
Sorry about the choppiness.

3526
02:43:48,980 --> 02:43:49,980
That's not us.

3527
02:43:49,980 --> 02:43:50,980
That's not us.

3528
02:43:50,980 --> 02:43:51,980
That was the bad connection for Alex.

3529
02:43:51,980 --> 02:43:52,980
Yeah.

3530
02:43:52,980 --> 02:43:53,980
He said, don't fire on us.

3531
02:43:53,980 --> 02:43:54,980
They're going to get one.

3532
02:43:54,980 --> 02:43:55,980
And that's what this comes down to.

3533
02:43:55,980 --> 02:43:56,980
And they just fired first.

3534
02:43:56,980 --> 02:44:09,220
She met a woman in the neck and if she dies, that's on you.

3535
02:44:09,220 --> 02:44:14,700
So Alex is justifying basically now a war on the government because they've taken first

3536
02:44:14,700 --> 02:44:22,300
blood by shooting this woman, which I thought he had confirmed is just in the leg, but I

3537
02:44:22,300 --> 02:44:24,100
guess that's not the case anymore.

3538
02:44:24,100 --> 02:44:33,420
I would argue that if somebody who believed in violent conspiracy theories was encouraged

3539
02:44:33,420 --> 02:44:38,980
to go to the mall and then stormed the Capitol building and was killed, that's probably more

3540
02:44:38,980 --> 02:44:40,860
on people like Alex.

3541
02:44:40,860 --> 02:44:46,780
I think it's tough because people have such similar information streams that are very

3542
02:44:46,780 --> 02:44:47,780
separate.

3543
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:49,100
That's why I said people like Alex.

3544
02:44:49,100 --> 02:44:50,100
Exactly.

3545
02:44:50,100 --> 02:44:51,100
Yeah, yeah.

3546
02:44:51,100 --> 02:44:52,100
It's that sphere.

3547
02:44:52,100 --> 02:44:53,100
It's the whole sphere.

3548
02:44:53,100 --> 02:44:54,100
Yeah.

3549
02:44:54,100 --> 02:44:55,100
It's decentralized.

3550
02:44:55,100 --> 02:44:59,300
Her death is on the right wing media ecosystem.

3551
02:44:59,300 --> 02:45:00,300
Yeah.

3552
02:45:00,300 --> 02:45:05,620
It's hard to personalize responsibility or to make it like, Alex, you did this because

3553
02:45:05,620 --> 02:45:09,740
it's kind of nebulous and impossible to nail down.

3554
02:45:09,740 --> 02:45:10,740
Totally.

3555
02:45:10,740 --> 02:45:19,300
But yeah, it does feel to me that you look at what is most responsible for the circumstances

3556
02:45:19,300 --> 02:45:20,680
that lead to this.

3557
02:45:20,680 --> 02:45:26,780
It's people believing in a fictional reality and there's a lot of people who are responsible

3558
02:45:26,780 --> 02:45:34,640
for creating, reinforcing, worsening those things and Alex is certainly one of them.

3559
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:37,700
Everybody on Fox News should be fucking slapped.

3560
02:45:37,700 --> 02:45:40,880
If they say anything about...

3561
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:45,220
You can hear them saying shit that people on Fox News said two days before, so it's

3562
02:45:45,220 --> 02:45:46,960
on you.

3563
02:45:46,960 --> 02:45:49,860
Everybody there should have been slapped in the face while it was going on.

3564
02:45:49,860 --> 02:45:52,100
It's your fucking fault.

3565
02:45:52,100 --> 02:45:54,560
But now, Alex wants you to deescalate.

3566
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:56,920
He wants everyone to go home.

3567
02:45:56,920 --> 02:45:57,920
Such a surprise.

3568
02:45:57,920 --> 02:45:58,920
It's time to go home.

3569
02:45:58,920 --> 02:46:03,220
I would advise everybody who happens to be watching down there on our feeds, go home

3570
02:46:03,220 --> 02:46:08,620
now, because we're not the bad guys that are instigating this and I don't want you to get

3571
02:46:08,620 --> 02:46:09,620
hurt.

3572
02:46:09,620 --> 02:46:10,620
Okay?

3573
02:46:10,620 --> 02:46:12,180
The globalists know they're losing.

3574
02:46:12,180 --> 02:46:15,980
They want to show some type of decisive force like Trump's bad, like we started this.

3575
02:46:15,980 --> 02:46:21,500
We need to deescalate this and people need to then decide, okay, and then watch what

3576
02:46:21,500 --> 02:46:26,540
happens and let them have the debate and let them have the process that we were starting

3577
02:46:26,540 --> 02:46:30,220
to win of showing the fraud, okay?

3578
02:46:30,220 --> 02:46:33,700
That's why they activated the provocateurs to trigger this, I believe, and we have witnesses

3579
02:46:33,700 --> 02:46:35,680
and it looks just like antifa.

3580
02:46:35,680 --> 02:46:40,360
So the reason that Alex is saying everyone go home, deescalate, is because he has what

3581
02:46:40,360 --> 02:46:41,940
he thinks he needs.

3582
02:46:41,940 --> 02:46:48,840
He thinks that everything that he was hoping to accomplish, and trying to make lemonade

3583
02:46:48,840 --> 02:46:53,860
out of the lemons that life has given him, obviously the most profitable route is continuing

3584
02:46:53,860 --> 02:46:57,940
just the terrorist edging game that he constantly does.

3585
02:46:57,940 --> 02:46:59,680
That's super manageable for him.

3586
02:46:59,680 --> 02:47:02,540
But now that this has happened, it's tough.

3587
02:47:02,540 --> 02:47:08,540
But on the bright side, Alex doesn't realize that Congress will just reconvene in the evening

3588
02:47:08,540 --> 02:47:10,940
and certify the election results.

3589
02:47:10,940 --> 02:47:16,140
So he thinks that there's a stay of execution that's going on here.

3590
02:47:16,140 --> 02:47:23,740
Simultaneously, he has this woman who has been killed by the police that he believes

3591
02:47:23,740 --> 02:47:27,340
he can build a martyr narrative out of.

3592
02:47:27,340 --> 02:47:31,900
He has all of the optics that he needs to build upon, move forward.

3593
02:47:31,900 --> 02:47:37,500
He's decided that this is antifa and he's going to put it on the left.

3594
02:47:37,500 --> 02:47:41,280
He has everything that he needs as long as it doesn't get worse.

3595
02:47:41,280 --> 02:47:44,020
And so that's what he's encouraging people to do.

3596
02:47:44,020 --> 02:47:47,060
He has no real effect on anyone's actions, I don't believe.

3597
02:47:47,060 --> 02:47:48,980
No, no, no, absolutely not.

3598
02:47:48,980 --> 02:47:50,620
But it's...

3599
02:47:50,620 --> 02:47:55,100
Imagine somebody in the Capitol building after having stormed it like, hold on, I got word

3600
02:47:55,100 --> 02:47:57,540
from Alex, we all got to go home, guys.

3601
02:47:57,540 --> 02:48:00,820
Hold on, guys, I'm listening to the very highly rated War Room program.

3602
02:48:00,820 --> 02:48:01,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3603
02:48:01,820 --> 02:48:03,540
Wait, I thought that one was in DC.

3604
02:48:03,540 --> 02:48:05,340
Yeah, Tom Pappertoasting today.

3605
02:48:05,340 --> 02:48:08,180
Ooh, turn it off.

3606
02:48:08,180 --> 02:48:14,220
So one of the dead giveaways that Alex is just like, listen, we can't let this get worse

3607
02:48:14,220 --> 02:48:15,580
is this.

3608
02:48:15,580 --> 02:48:20,860
I would advise all the great people down here to understand we are contesting, we are fighting,

3609
02:48:20,860 --> 02:48:22,260
we've not reached this point yet.

3610
02:48:22,260 --> 02:48:24,980
I would advise people to get off the streets by six o'clock tonight.

3611
02:48:24,980 --> 02:48:27,540
Alex is telling people to accept a curfew.

3612
02:48:27,540 --> 02:48:28,540
Yeah.

3613
02:48:28,540 --> 02:48:29,540
What?

3614
02:48:29,540 --> 02:48:34,820
Hey, you know what happens when your revolutionary movement is led by a bunch of rich people

3615
02:48:34,820 --> 02:48:43,560
and grifters and scam artists and your supreme leader is a fucking coward asking vice presidents

3616
02:48:43,560 --> 02:48:48,440
to overthrow a country for him, and then he decided to run away.

3617
02:48:48,440 --> 02:48:54,260
He ran away, he fleed from your overthrow capital attack.

3618
02:48:54,260 --> 02:48:59,860
And then your hero anti-government guy tells you, hey, listen to the state when they tell

3619
02:48:59,860 --> 02:49:01,380
you to go home at a certain time.

3620
02:49:01,380 --> 02:49:02,380
Yeah, totally.

3621
02:49:02,380 --> 02:49:03,380
Listen to that curfew.

3622
02:49:03,380 --> 02:49:04,980
Hey, you know who we're fighting?

3623
02:49:04,980 --> 02:49:07,140
The literal Christian devil.

3624
02:49:07,140 --> 02:49:09,140
But nightfall.

3625
02:49:09,140 --> 02:49:10,740
We only fight in the day.

3626
02:49:10,740 --> 02:49:16,100
Now, I have been spending a lot of time on my program yelling about how, you know, curfews

3627
02:49:16,100 --> 02:49:19,460
are basically, you know, that and masks are basically slavery.

3628
02:49:19,460 --> 02:49:20,460
Yeah, just slavery.

3629
02:49:20,460 --> 02:49:21,460
Government overreach.

3630
02:49:21,460 --> 02:49:22,460
Go home by six.

3631
02:49:22,460 --> 02:49:23,460
Well, it's six.

3632
02:49:23,460 --> 02:49:25,540
Yeah, it's nightfall guys.

3633
02:49:25,540 --> 02:49:27,540
Gotta go home.

3634
02:49:27,540 --> 02:49:29,100
This is actually kind of interesting.

3635
02:49:29,100 --> 02:49:33,780
At this point, Alex reports that this woman who was shot has died.

3636
02:49:33,780 --> 02:49:34,780
This is way before.

3637
02:49:34,780 --> 02:49:37,020
Yeah, I was going to say, we didn't find that out.

3638
02:49:37,020 --> 02:49:38,020
No.

3639
02:49:38,020 --> 02:49:39,020
No.

3640
02:49:39,020 --> 02:49:40,020
We got really bad news.

3641
02:49:40,020 --> 02:49:41,020
Try to get her name.

3642
02:49:41,020 --> 02:49:45,620
Is that from our police sources or is that, that's exclusive.

3643
02:49:45,620 --> 02:49:51,100
Guys, the woman that they shot looks like some type of security for the senators.

3644
02:49:51,100 --> 02:49:53,260
The woman they shot died.

3645
02:49:53,260 --> 02:49:56,540
So the woman who shot on the screen, she's dead.

3646
02:49:56,540 --> 02:49:58,900
I gotta go talk to our folks.

3647
02:49:58,900 --> 02:50:01,380
We got DC police that we've got hired off duty.

3648
02:50:01,380 --> 02:50:04,740
So I gotta give you the latest stuff and they're talking to Capitol Police right now.

3649
02:50:04,740 --> 02:50:08,860
I don't know what to make of this because it did end up being correct.

3650
02:50:08,860 --> 02:50:09,860
Right.

3651
02:50:09,860 --> 02:50:12,180
But I still don't think Alex had a source on that.

3652
02:50:12,180 --> 02:50:14,140
I think that was just a good bet.

3653
02:50:14,140 --> 02:50:15,140
Yeah.

3654
02:50:15,140 --> 02:50:19,060
I think he knew that there was a good chance she was going to pass and decided to make

3655
02:50:19,060 --> 02:50:21,700
it definitive, claim there was a source.

3656
02:50:21,700 --> 02:50:22,700
Yeah.

3657
02:50:22,700 --> 02:50:23,700
Yeah.

3658
02:50:23,700 --> 02:50:27,860
Up until that point, all the confirmed reports were very much like...

3659
02:50:27,860 --> 02:50:28,860
Nonsense.

3660
02:50:28,860 --> 02:50:29,860
Well, I mean...

3661
02:50:29,860 --> 02:50:33,660
Oh, I meant confirmed reports that Alex is saying.

3662
02:50:33,660 --> 02:50:34,660
The real world.

3663
02:50:34,660 --> 02:50:35,660
Right.

3664
02:50:35,660 --> 02:50:36,660
Right.

3665
02:50:36,660 --> 02:50:42,160
The reporting was like, we saw her get this type of medical treatment, which they only

3666
02:50:42,160 --> 02:50:46,140
give in the most extreme of circumstances.

3667
02:50:46,140 --> 02:50:47,620
So it would be surprising.

3668
02:50:47,620 --> 02:50:48,620
Critical condition.

3669
02:50:48,620 --> 02:50:49,620
Yeah.

3670
02:50:49,620 --> 02:50:50,620
Yeah.

3671
02:50:50,620 --> 02:50:51,620
So it would be, it's a good bet.

3672
02:50:51,620 --> 02:50:52,620
It's not, I doubt he knew.

3673
02:50:52,620 --> 02:50:53,620
Yeah.

3674
02:50:53,620 --> 02:50:57,300
When I said that the confirmed reports are nonsense, I mean the things that Alex has

3675
02:50:57,300 --> 02:50:59,020
tried to pass off as confirmed reports.

3676
02:50:59,020 --> 02:51:00,020
Yes, exactly.

3677
02:51:00,020 --> 02:51:01,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3678
02:51:01,020 --> 02:51:02,020
Totally.

3679
02:51:02,020 --> 02:51:03,020
We just had a misunderstanding.

3680
02:51:03,020 --> 02:51:04,020
Yeah, totally.

3681
02:51:04,020 --> 02:51:05,020
We got to crossfire.

3682
02:51:05,020 --> 02:51:08,420
So Alex, now in light of this decision that he's made, or maybe somebody has given him

3683
02:51:08,420 --> 02:51:13,100
a tip that she has passed, now we need to set the narrative.

3684
02:51:13,100 --> 02:51:17,900
I see it in fullwars.com, I'm not mad, we're just directing live from the air, that it

3685
02:51:17,900 --> 02:51:20,100
still says, watch live.

3686
02:51:20,100 --> 02:51:24,500
Today's the day Alex Jones leads largest Patriot movement in history through DC.

3687
02:51:24,500 --> 02:51:32,420
Let's update that, that DC now under martial law, feds murder innocent woman, Pence turns

3688
02:51:32,420 --> 02:51:33,420
against Trump.

3689
02:51:33,420 --> 02:51:34,420
Okay.

3690
02:51:34,420 --> 02:51:38,300
Let me give you that one again.

3691
02:51:38,300 --> 02:51:39,300
Okay.

3692
02:51:39,300 --> 02:51:40,300
Okay.

3693
02:51:40,300 --> 02:51:48,940
DC now under martial law, feds shoot and kill innocent woman.

3694
02:51:48,940 --> 02:51:51,020
Pence turns against Trump.

3695
02:51:51,020 --> 02:51:54,060
We have to get the narrative out of the truth of them killing this woman.

3696
02:51:54,060 --> 02:51:56,020
You got to get the narrative out.

3697
02:51:56,020 --> 02:51:58,300
This is the narrative that we need to set.

3698
02:51:58,300 --> 02:52:02,220
Pence is now the bad guy, the cops murdered this woman in cold blood, and the city is

3699
02:52:02,220 --> 02:52:03,840
under martial law.

3700
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:07,700
And of course the sub-narratives, of course the martial law was precipitated by false

3701
02:52:07,700 --> 02:52:13,500
flag, takeover of the Capitol building, it was provocateured by Antifa.

3702
02:52:13,500 --> 02:52:16,220
Fight the power, but also go home at six.

3703
02:52:16,220 --> 02:52:17,220
Yeah.

3704
02:52:17,220 --> 02:52:20,500
Pence is trying to make this work and it's just pathetic.

3705
02:52:20,500 --> 02:52:28,580
So he has some footage of this shooting and he constantly describes it as execution style.

3706
02:52:28,580 --> 02:52:30,740
And again, that's just the narrative that's being set.

3707
02:52:30,740 --> 02:52:31,740
I saw the video.

3708
02:52:31,740 --> 02:52:34,980
I just want the footage of them execute the woman.

3709
02:52:34,980 --> 02:52:37,300
They just walk up and shoot her right in the neck.

3710
02:52:37,300 --> 02:52:41,380
A nonviolent woman wasn't even the woman trying to break through the glass, they just execute

3711
02:52:41,380 --> 02:52:42,380
her.

3712
02:52:42,380 --> 02:52:45,060
And they're the good guys and it's Trump's fault, it's our fault.

3713
02:52:45,060 --> 02:52:49,060
No, it's your fault, globalist, and if you want to fight, you're gonna fucking get one,

3714
02:52:49,060 --> 02:52:50,700
you got that?

3715
02:52:50,700 --> 02:52:51,700
Fucking bullies.

3716
02:52:51,700 --> 02:52:52,700
So, yeah.

3717
02:52:52,700 --> 02:52:53,700
Fucking bullies.

3718
02:52:53,700 --> 02:52:58,380
I have unfortunately also seen this video, I did not want to, but Alex plays it a bunch

3719
02:52:58,380 --> 02:53:06,320
of times, and it seems very clear that he has made a point to have everyone say that

3720
02:53:06,320 --> 02:53:14,180
this was execution, because that term is now used almost blanketly.

3721
02:53:14,180 --> 02:53:18,020
And get this, this is weird, Alex has found a first-hand witness.

3722
02:53:18,020 --> 02:53:22,340
We're gonna, in a couple of minutes, we're gonna have Pepper take over, because we've

3723
02:53:22,340 --> 02:53:27,020
got a guest that was one of the first to go in today that witnessed it all, so stay there.

3724
02:53:27,020 --> 02:53:30,820
So we're gonna have an eyewitness guest that was in the building and witnessed the whole

3725
02:53:30,820 --> 02:53:32,260
thing, but we now have it confirmed.

3726
02:53:32,260 --> 02:53:36,940
Oh my god, what a shock, we got a witness, we got a first-hand witness.

3727
02:53:36,940 --> 02:53:43,040
You don't get to tell me that you're revolting and overthrowing the government, and then

3728
02:53:43,040 --> 02:53:48,980
be like, oh, this innocent woman was murdered in cold blood by the cops.

3729
02:53:48,980 --> 02:53:53,420
No, you said you're fighting a revolution, people die in a revolution.

3730
02:53:53,420 --> 02:54:01,300
Or conversely, Antifa provocateur'd things, and then she wouldn't be, I don't understand.

3731
02:54:01,300 --> 02:54:04,860
So if she's not- It's hard.

3732
02:54:04,860 --> 02:54:07,340
It's hard to figure out exactly what the narrative is.

3733
02:54:07,340 --> 02:54:12,660
Basically they're all false flag provocateurs except for her, she was a hero, and I don't

3734
02:54:12,660 --> 02:54:13,660
know.

3735
02:54:13,660 --> 02:54:19,700
Yeah, see, I can care that she was killed, because I'm living in the real world where

3736
02:54:19,700 --> 02:54:25,700
what happened was a woman's brain was destroyed and melted, and then here we are.

3737
02:54:25,700 --> 02:54:30,580
But they can't care, because they're fighting a real fucking war against the devil.

3738
02:54:30,580 --> 02:54:34,580
They should all be expecting to die immediately.

3739
02:54:34,580 --> 02:54:37,900
That's what, you're fighting the literal Christian devil.

3740
02:54:37,900 --> 02:54:42,380
Yeah, and- Don't hand-ring about one person dying.

3741
02:54:42,380 --> 02:54:49,460
It does seem weird, and it also seems weird to go halfway in terms of we have breached

3742
02:54:49,460 --> 02:54:53,980
the Capitol building and be like, we'll fight another day.

3743
02:54:53,980 --> 02:54:59,620
It seems weird, if you think that you're up against the actual devil, you're already midstream.

3744
02:54:59,620 --> 02:55:00,620
It's very weird.

3745
02:55:00,620 --> 02:55:01,740
No, it's pathetic.

3746
02:55:01,740 --> 02:55:04,580
But that's because that's not really what they want.

3747
02:55:04,580 --> 02:55:06,620
They don't want that.

3748
02:55:06,620 --> 02:55:09,780
It's like what you were saying, the people who they're probably the most mad at are the

3749
02:55:09,780 --> 02:55:12,920
people who followed through with what they keep saying should be done.

3750
02:55:12,920 --> 02:55:15,260
We want your money.

3751
02:55:15,260 --> 02:55:17,220
We don't actually want a Ron Paul presidency.

3752
02:55:17,220 --> 02:55:19,980
Do you realize what would happen if that shit happened?

3753
02:55:19,980 --> 02:55:22,500
We would lose our money.

3754
02:55:22,500 --> 02:55:28,100
So Tom Papert hosts for a little while, and this is just, he's doing the work to build

3755
02:55:28,100 --> 02:55:31,660
up this narrative that this woman was a martyr.

3756
02:55:31,660 --> 02:55:36,860
I will completely admit that I am a chauvinist, and I forced all of our female reporters on

3757
02:55:36,860 --> 02:55:39,060
the ground to get the hell out of there.

3758
02:55:39,060 --> 02:55:42,180
Everyone is on a train getting multiple states away right now.

3759
02:55:42,180 --> 02:55:43,780
This is not a safe place.

3760
02:55:43,780 --> 02:55:50,260
These are the times that try many souls, and this is, it's not the time to be a martyr.

3761
02:55:50,260 --> 02:55:54,660
They've already made a martyr, and that is what this young woman will be.

3762
02:55:54,660 --> 02:56:00,980
The police shot and killed a woman because they didn't like her form of protest.

3763
02:56:00,980 --> 02:56:03,500
I'd say...

3764
02:56:03,500 --> 02:56:08,820
I mean, if your form of protest is storming the Capitol building, I would argue, yeah!

3765
02:56:08,820 --> 02:56:09,820
Yeah!

3766
02:56:09,820 --> 02:56:10,820
Yeah!

3767
02:56:10,820 --> 02:56:11,820
So, um...

3768
02:56:11,820 --> 02:56:15,940
This is all the martyr, this is, now is not the time to martyr yourself.

3769
02:56:15,940 --> 02:56:17,780
Obviously we're fighting the devil.

3770
02:56:17,780 --> 02:56:18,780
Yeah.

3771
02:56:18,780 --> 02:56:25,860
I'm going to tell you that I have some real negative feelings about how Alex handles the

3772
02:56:25,860 --> 02:56:30,500
fact that he has footage of this shooting.

3773
02:56:30,500 --> 02:56:38,260
But there's a really interesting dynamic at play about the provenance of this footage.

3774
02:56:38,260 --> 02:56:45,620
And Alex kind of reveals too much, and then it pretends that he didn't say these things.

3775
02:56:45,620 --> 02:56:50,180
I have seen a snuff film today.

3776
02:56:50,180 --> 02:56:55,280
I just saw footage of an innocent woman that one of our own cameramen followed the crowds

3777
02:56:55,280 --> 02:57:01,380
into the Senate, and I watched them execute an unarmed woman with a Trump flag shooting

3778
02:57:01,380 --> 02:57:04,380
her in the neck at point blank range.

3779
02:57:04,380 --> 02:57:06,660
We are uploading the footage right now.

3780
02:57:06,660 --> 02:57:10,900
So one of your camera people, one of your employees, was one of the people who was along

3781
02:57:10,900 --> 02:57:17,260
storming the Senate and was there close enough to get this video of this woman being shot.

3782
02:57:17,260 --> 02:57:18,260
Yeah.

3783
02:57:18,260 --> 02:57:19,260
Interesting.

3784
02:57:19,260 --> 02:57:20,260
Yeah.

3785
02:57:20,260 --> 02:57:21,260
So that is what he's saying.

3786
02:57:21,260 --> 02:57:22,260
Yeah.

3787
02:57:22,260 --> 02:57:23,260
Weird.

3788
02:57:23,260 --> 02:57:26,980
You would think that the psycho, like, and we had a cameraman in there, all of a sudden

3789
02:57:26,980 --> 02:57:32,020
everybody around him would just go, ee, ee, ee, ee, stabbing him through the fucking neck.

3790
02:57:32,020 --> 02:57:33,020
Yeah.

3791
02:57:33,020 --> 02:57:34,020
Alex, that hurts, that hurts.

3792
02:57:34,020 --> 02:57:35,020
Don't do that.

3793
02:57:35,020 --> 02:57:36,020
Don't do this.

3794
02:57:36,020 --> 02:57:40,500
The cameraman is freaking out about the criminals in Congress, and I don't, I just think this

3795
02:57:40,500 --> 02:57:44,160
is a little, I think I kept this clip because it's so out of place.

3796
02:57:44,160 --> 02:57:45,160
It's a weird outburst.

3797
02:57:45,160 --> 02:57:46,160
Okay.

3798
02:57:46,160 --> 02:57:49,380
And this is the biggest frustration, and this is why this is so difficult, why we're on

3799
02:57:49,380 --> 02:57:50,980
a high wire here.

3800
02:57:50,980 --> 02:57:52,340
We're not at war with the police.

3801
02:57:52,340 --> 02:57:53,540
I don't look at the police like my enemy.

3802
02:57:53,540 --> 02:57:54,540
I don't look at Antifa like my enemy.

3803
02:57:54,540 --> 02:57:55,540
Look, they're choosing the wrong side.

3804
02:57:55,540 --> 02:57:59,980
I don't look like BLM is my enemy, but man, the fucking criminals are sitting in that

3805
02:57:59,980 --> 02:58:04,020
fucking building, taking my fucking country, and I'm fucking sick of it, man.

3806
02:58:04,020 --> 02:58:05,660
And these people are too.

3807
02:58:05,660 --> 02:58:06,660
That's all.

3808
02:58:06,660 --> 02:58:09,460
And you guys just keep killing women and stuff and see what happens.

3809
02:58:09,460 --> 02:58:10,460
Yep.

3810
02:58:10,460 --> 02:58:11,460
You're damn right.

3811
02:58:11,460 --> 02:58:14,620
Because they take our kindness for weakness.

3812
02:58:14,620 --> 02:58:18,860
So now they're on top of a building, I think, at a like a press location.

3813
02:58:18,860 --> 02:58:19,860
Okay.

3814
02:58:19,860 --> 02:58:20,860
So like, I don't...

3815
02:58:20,860 --> 02:58:25,020
This sounds like three dudes at a bar arguing about how they fucking lost, and they're like,

3816
02:58:25,020 --> 02:58:28,140
no, no, no, we won the game, we'll get them next time.

3817
02:58:28,140 --> 02:58:31,220
It's really hard to tell, but that was bizarre.

3818
02:58:31,220 --> 02:58:32,220
Yeah.

3819
02:58:32,220 --> 02:58:33,980
So anyway, Rob Doo is there too.

3820
02:58:33,980 --> 02:58:34,980
He's hanging out.

3821
02:58:34,980 --> 02:58:35,980
Of course.

3822
02:58:35,980 --> 02:58:36,980
He's watched this death film.

3823
02:58:36,980 --> 02:58:37,980
Yeah, I just watched it a couple times.

3824
02:58:37,980 --> 02:58:38,980
It's pretty sad.

3825
02:58:38,980 --> 02:58:39,980
She's climbing...

3826
02:58:39,980 --> 02:58:40,980
Why don't you come here?

3827
02:58:40,980 --> 02:58:41,980
Come here.

3828
02:58:41,980 --> 02:58:42,980
Come here.

3829
02:58:42,980 --> 02:58:43,980
Okay.

3830
02:58:43,980 --> 02:58:44,980
I understand you just watched it.

3831
02:58:44,980 --> 02:58:46,460
When is the network going to have it?

3832
02:58:46,460 --> 02:58:47,460
They have it.

3833
02:58:47,460 --> 02:58:48,460
They have it now.

3834
02:58:48,460 --> 02:58:52,740
I'm not ready to show it yet, because I want to give viewer discretion's advice.

3835
02:58:52,740 --> 02:58:53,740
Describe what...

3836
02:58:53,740 --> 02:58:58,140
We're going to show you the HD footage in a minute of the execution.

3837
02:58:58,140 --> 02:59:05,900
So Alex's big take on this is that the media and the news played the police footage of

3838
02:59:05,900 --> 02:59:08,100
the killing of George Floyd.

3839
02:59:08,100 --> 02:59:09,100
Yeah.

3840
02:59:09,100 --> 02:59:10,900
And so he's like, well, I'm going to play this.

3841
02:59:10,900 --> 02:59:12,900
I want you to watch it.

3842
02:59:12,900 --> 02:59:17,900
I want it next hour, because we're going to slow it down so you get to see her, because

3843
02:59:17,900 --> 02:59:22,220
like George Floyd, that thing on his neck, and he's ODing on heroin.

3844
02:59:22,220 --> 02:59:23,220
It's a terrible thing.

3845
02:59:23,220 --> 02:59:25,740
The cops are in the wrong, but they didn't do it on purpose.

3846
02:59:25,740 --> 02:59:26,900
This is on purpose.

3847
02:59:26,900 --> 02:59:31,700
I want you to see her die slow, because believe me, if she was still here and she's with God

3848
02:59:31,700 --> 02:59:38,660
now, she'd want to be seen for what she did, executed while she was just trying to execute

3849
02:59:38,660 --> 02:59:39,660
her own first amendment.

3850
02:59:39,660 --> 02:59:43,580
So we're going to play the footage raw next hour.

3851
02:59:43,580 --> 02:59:46,300
That's psychologically so fucked up.

3852
02:59:46,300 --> 02:59:49,940
I want you to watch her die slow.

3853
02:59:49,940 --> 02:59:52,280
That's so gross.

3854
02:59:52,280 --> 02:59:53,620
She would have wanted me.

3855
02:59:53,620 --> 02:59:56,240
You don't even know who this person is.

3856
02:59:56,240 --> 03:00:01,940
I mean, you can guess some things about her based on the fact that she stormed the Capitol.

3857
03:00:01,940 --> 03:00:03,340
But those would be weak assumptions.

3858
03:00:03,340 --> 03:00:04,340
They wouldn't be great.

3859
03:00:04,340 --> 03:00:05,500
They wouldn't be great.

3860
03:00:05,500 --> 03:00:07,380
But Tom Pappert is doing his job.

3861
03:00:07,380 --> 03:00:11,620
Alex has declared this an execution, and so while he's hosting, he's really trying to

3862
03:00:11,620 --> 03:00:12,620
push that.

3863
03:00:12,620 --> 03:00:20,620
Again, Infowars has exclusive video of the martyr of DC, the MAGA martyr who was executed

3864
03:00:20,620 --> 03:00:22,220
Shawn execution style.

3865
03:00:22,220 --> 03:00:23,300
I've seen the video.

3866
03:00:23,300 --> 03:00:33,180
I don't know what else you call it by these jackboots of Muriel Bowser by the jackboots

3867
03:00:33,180 --> 03:00:34,380
of Joe Biden.

3868
03:00:34,380 --> 03:00:36,020
Joe Biden's jackboots.

3869
03:00:36,020 --> 03:00:37,420
You fucking nerds.

3870
03:00:37,420 --> 03:00:38,420
Yeah.

3871
03:00:38,420 --> 03:00:39,420
Get the fuck out of here.

3872
03:00:39,420 --> 03:00:40,420
Call them Koopa Troopas.

3873
03:00:40,420 --> 03:00:41,420
Yeah.

3874
03:00:41,420 --> 03:00:42,420
No kidding.

3875
03:00:42,420 --> 03:00:43,580
The jackboots.

3876
03:00:43,580 --> 03:00:45,140
Her name is Bowser.

3877
03:00:45,140 --> 03:00:46,140
Make use of it.

3878
03:00:46,140 --> 03:00:48,140
Good God.

3879
03:00:48,140 --> 03:00:52,700
So anyway, Pappert also let slip that the person who got this footage is employed by

3880
03:00:52,700 --> 03:00:53,900
Infowars.

3881
03:00:53,900 --> 03:01:00,340
I know the Infowars cameraman who was in the room who captured the footage when it happened.

3882
03:01:00,340 --> 03:01:01,340
Say his name out loud.

3883
03:01:01,340 --> 03:01:02,340
I hope the man is okay.

3884
03:01:02,340 --> 03:01:05,780
He's a strong man, but I don't know if I would be.

3885
03:01:05,780 --> 03:01:12,540
So Tom Pappert is playing some clips, responding to them, and at this point, there's a group

3886
03:01:12,540 --> 03:01:19,700
of Trump supporters who find a media set up, and they start attacking the lights and what

3887
03:01:19,700 --> 03:01:20,700
have you.

3888
03:01:20,700 --> 03:01:21,700
I haven't seen any violence, though.

3889
03:01:21,700 --> 03:01:22,900
None.

3890
03:01:22,900 --> 03:01:27,380
But what's really funny here is that I was watching this, and Tom Pappert is playing

3891
03:01:27,380 --> 03:01:32,300
this video, and he has to pretend that he can't see Trump flags.

3892
03:01:32,300 --> 03:01:35,460
It's so pathetic.

3893
03:01:35,460 --> 03:01:41,940
More clashes happening, it appears, between the media and Trump supporters.

3894
03:01:41,940 --> 03:01:42,940
Or is that the left?

3895
03:01:42,940 --> 03:01:48,260
I can't tell what kind of flag that is, but more clashes happening in DC as the sun starts

3896
03:01:48,260 --> 03:01:49,260
to go down a little bit.

3897
03:01:49,260 --> 03:01:53,940
Things are gonna get a little bit darker, Antifa will come out, those appear to be lights.

3898
03:01:53,940 --> 03:01:58,100
Looks like somebody was maybe doing a stand up, some news outlet was doing a stand up.

3899
03:01:58,100 --> 03:02:00,860
That's just dumb as well.

3900
03:02:00,860 --> 03:02:05,600
To the media, to my friends in the media, I've given my reporters, and we are the renegade

3901
03:02:05,600 --> 03:02:09,940
news outlet that is doing this by the seat of our pants.

3902
03:02:09,940 --> 03:02:11,420
I told my people, go home.

3903
03:02:11,420 --> 03:02:15,380
I told my people, nobody's gonna get shot today on my watch.

3904
03:02:15,380 --> 03:02:21,740
Mainstream media journalists who are out there to get the footage to make us look bad, you're

3905
03:02:21,740 --> 03:02:25,060
not safe for Antifa or police either, I'm sorry.

3906
03:02:25,060 --> 03:02:26,960
That's not a threat, that's an observation.

3907
03:02:26,960 --> 03:02:27,960
No it's not a threat.

3908
03:02:27,960 --> 03:02:30,020
Because these people are feral.

3909
03:02:30,020 --> 03:02:31,780
I think you might need to go to therapy.

3910
03:02:31,780 --> 03:02:36,160
I, okay, here's the problem, here's the problem, alright, okay.

3911
03:02:36,160 --> 03:02:40,600
Here's why that's so obviously transparently bullshit.

3912
03:02:40,600 --> 03:02:47,820
Because if they were Antifa provocateurs, they would still be carrying Trump flags.

3913
03:02:47,820 --> 03:02:50,420
They wouldn't be carrying Antifa flags.

3914
03:02:50,420 --> 03:02:52,580
Oh yeah, that's true.

3915
03:02:52,580 --> 03:02:53,580
That's a great point.

3916
03:02:53,580 --> 03:02:54,580
Yeah.

3917
03:02:54,580 --> 03:02:55,580
Also, based on-

3918
03:02:55,580 --> 03:02:56,580
Everything else.

3919
03:02:56,580 --> 03:03:01,860
Based on what Tom Papert is describing, conflict journalism should not exist.

3920
03:03:01,860 --> 03:03:02,860
I can't-

3921
03:03:02,860 --> 03:03:07,340
Hey look, look, I understand everyone's curious what's going on in a war zone, but you journalists

3922
03:03:07,340 --> 03:03:08,700
are fucking stupid.

3923
03:03:08,700 --> 03:03:15,420
Hey, hey, journalists, the cops in Antifa are gonna, they're not your friends and they're

3924
03:03:15,420 --> 03:03:17,140
gonna come after you too.

3925
03:03:17,140 --> 03:03:19,040
No, no they're not.

3926
03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:20,700
You guys are.

3927
03:03:20,700 --> 03:03:28,620
So something bad happens on this broadcast and that is they've been teasing this death

3928
03:03:28,620 --> 03:03:35,940
footage that they're gonna play, viewer discretion advised, but they get scooped, someone else

3929
03:03:35,940 --> 03:03:36,940
releases it.

3930
03:03:36,940 --> 03:03:37,940
Oh no.

3931
03:03:37,940 --> 03:03:42,780
We will be going live here in just a second with Alex Jones, he's going to come in and

3932
03:03:42,780 --> 03:03:43,780
break the video.

3933
03:03:43,780 --> 03:03:47,940
Sorry, it's just my cry who was telling them do not upload this video anywhere, it is an

3934
03:03:47,940 --> 03:03:50,980
Info Wars exclusive and then all of a sudden I'm seeing it go up.

3935
03:03:50,980 --> 03:03:52,220
So not sure what happened there.

3936
03:03:52,220 --> 03:03:53,540
Yep, someone else got the footage.

3937
03:03:53,540 --> 03:03:54,540
Somebody else got there first.

3938
03:03:54,540 --> 03:04:00,020
Some other dude, Michael Codray, I think, a guy from Stop a Steal, got the footage and

3939
03:04:00,020 --> 03:04:02,440
he uploaded it and got scooped.

3940
03:04:02,440 --> 03:04:03,980
No longer an Info Wars exclusive.

3941
03:04:03,980 --> 03:04:05,100
Oh, poor guys.

3942
03:04:05,100 --> 03:04:07,020
They can still get Rob Doo though.

3943
03:04:07,020 --> 03:04:08,020
Yes.

3944
03:04:08,020 --> 03:04:09,020
I don't know.

3945
03:04:09,020 --> 03:04:10,020
He might be in the wind.

3946
03:04:10,020 --> 03:04:13,020
He might be too high enough.

3947
03:04:13,020 --> 03:04:22,460
So I noticed there are similarities in how Harrison is aping traits and patterns that

3948
03:04:22,460 --> 03:04:24,700
Alex Jones does.

3949
03:04:24,700 --> 03:04:25,700
In-house style.

3950
03:04:25,700 --> 03:04:26,700
Exactly.

3951
03:04:26,700 --> 03:04:33,060
And I noticed one that Tom Papert is doing an impression of, or just basically Alex does

3952
03:04:33,060 --> 03:04:38,660
it so it's totally fine, and that is reporting something based on imagining it.

3953
03:04:38,660 --> 03:04:42,840
I guarantee you as we speak right now, they're trying to use the 25th Amendment to remove

3954
03:04:42,840 --> 03:04:46,580
Trump and do a full and complete and total coup right before our eyes.

3955
03:04:46,580 --> 03:04:50,240
I guarantee you that's the conversation and Mike Pence is leading it.

3956
03:04:50,240 --> 03:04:54,020
I can almost, this is without sources, I'm just telling you I know how these people think.

3957
03:04:54,020 --> 03:04:57,340
I've spent enough time covering them like Alex Jones has, not nearly as much as him,

3958
03:04:57,340 --> 03:04:59,180
but you figure it out pretty quick, they're sick.

3959
03:04:59,180 --> 03:05:03,860
I'm making this up and I guarantee you because I know I've followed these people for so long

3960
03:05:03,860 --> 03:05:07,660
they're sick and I know what they're doing and it's all just based on nothing.

3961
03:05:07,660 --> 03:05:08,940
Just feels so true though.

3962
03:05:08,940 --> 03:05:09,940
Yeah.

3963
03:05:09,940 --> 03:05:10,940
So true.

3964
03:05:10,940 --> 03:05:11,940
This is a coup.

3965
03:05:11,940 --> 03:05:18,840
You know, after we stormed the Capitol building, they're going to coup, wait, our guy's the

3966
03:05:18,840 --> 03:05:19,840
president now.

3967
03:05:19,840 --> 03:05:21,180
Speaking of coup.

3968
03:05:21,180 --> 03:05:24,040
So now is the coup, but...

3969
03:05:24,040 --> 03:05:26,780
You know who's conspicuous in their absence?

3970
03:05:26,780 --> 03:05:27,780
Steve Pechenik.

3971
03:05:27,780 --> 03:05:32,540
No, he's, he's got to get those ballots.

3972
03:05:32,540 --> 03:05:35,220
We've got to find those ballots, man.

3973
03:05:35,220 --> 03:05:37,820
They've got the blockchain.

3974
03:05:37,820 --> 03:05:45,140
I would say call number one for me if I'm Alex, Steve, get your ass on air.

3975
03:05:45,140 --> 03:05:49,380
Trump has abandoned us, so it's time for Melania to take over.

3976
03:05:49,380 --> 03:05:52,700
Also conspicuous in their absence, Roger Stone.

3977
03:05:52,700 --> 03:05:56,060
Hey, Roger, do you want to come on?

3978
03:05:56,060 --> 03:05:57,060
No.

3979
03:05:57,060 --> 03:05:59,460
I don't.

3980
03:05:59,460 --> 03:06:01,580
Please leave a message for Roger Stone.

3981
03:06:01,580 --> 03:06:02,580
Yeah, exactly.

3982
03:06:02,580 --> 03:06:03,580
That shit's going to voicemail.

3983
03:06:03,580 --> 03:06:06,380
I am not dealing with Alex's bullshit today.

3984
03:06:06,380 --> 03:06:07,380
Nope.

3985
03:06:07,380 --> 03:06:08,380
Gotta eat a sandwich myself.

3986
03:06:08,380 --> 03:06:12,020
I am drunk in the bunker.

3987
03:06:12,020 --> 03:06:18,420
So we get now to Alex's firsthand guy who got the video.

3988
03:06:18,420 --> 03:06:19,420
Sure.

3989
03:06:19,420 --> 03:06:24,860
Now Alex is going to pretend that he hasn't already said that this person works for InfoWars.

3990
03:06:24,860 --> 03:06:27,700
All right, Tyler Hansen is here with us.

3991
03:06:27,700 --> 03:06:28,900
He was another witness.

3992
03:06:28,900 --> 03:06:32,220
I've seen his footage, absolutely horrible, of this poor woman.

3993
03:06:32,220 --> 03:06:37,660
We don't know her name yet, who was executed by some type of security force inside the

3994
03:06:37,660 --> 03:06:41,160
North Korean death chamber that is the US Capitol.

3995
03:06:41,160 --> 03:06:46,180
Alex conveniently fails to mention that Taylor Hansen, not Tyler, is the InfoWars cameraman

3996
03:06:46,180 --> 03:06:48,500
that's been referenced multiple times already.

3997
03:06:48,500 --> 03:06:53,480
Owen was hanging out with Taylor the night before, and by hanging out, this is actually

3998
03:06:53,480 --> 03:06:54,480
what I mean.

3999
03:06:54,480 --> 03:06:55,480
Here's how they took video.

4000
03:06:55,480 --> 03:07:03,340
All right, so my good friend Taylor here is going to do a little Black Lives Matter enrichment

4001
03:07:03,340 --> 03:07:04,340
ceremony.

4002
03:07:04,340 --> 03:07:05,340
Taylor, Tyler, Taylor.

4003
03:07:05,340 --> 03:07:06,340
So who wants to see this flag?

4004
03:07:06,340 --> 03:07:07,340
To my audience, I'm just going to say, I'm not afraid of any kind of security.

4005
03:07:07,340 --> 03:07:08,340
VLM sucks.

4006
03:07:08,340 --> 03:07:09,340
VLM sucks.

4007
03:07:09,340 --> 03:07:10,340
VLM sucks.

4008
03:07:10,340 --> 03:07:11,340
VLM sucks.

4009
03:07:11,340 --> 03:07:12,340
VLM sucks.

4010
03:07:12,340 --> 03:07:13,340
VLM sucks.

4011
03:07:13,340 --> 03:07:14,340
VLM sucks.

4012
03:07:14,340 --> 03:07:15,340
VLM sucks.

4013
03:07:15,340 --> 03:07:16,340
VLM sucks.

4014
03:07:16,340 --> 03:07:17,340
VLM sucks.

4015
03:07:17,340 --> 03:07:18,340
VLM sucks.

4016
03:07:18,340 --> 03:07:19,340
VLM sucks.

4017
03:07:19,340 --> 03:07:20,340
VLM sucks.

4018
03:07:20,340 --> 03:07:21,340
VLM sucks.

4019
03:07:21,340 --> 03:07:22,340
VLM sucks.

4020
03:07:22,340 --> 03:07:25,740
VLM sucks.

4021
03:07:25,740 --> 03:07:30,280
VLM sucks.

4022
03:07:30,280 --> 03:07:34,000
VLM sucks.

4023
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:36,960
VLM sucks.

4024
03:07:36,960 --> 03:07:39,540
VLM sucks.

4025
03:07:39,540 --> 03:07:42,020
What the fuck is going on here, dude?

4026
03:07:42,020 --> 03:07:43,100
We're going to get all dirt on it.

4027
03:07:43,100 --> 03:07:44,100
Yeah.

4028
03:07:44,100 --> 03:07:45,100
Fuck Antifa.

4029
03:07:45,100 --> 03:07:46,100
Fuck Antifa.

4030
03:07:46,100 --> 03:07:47,100
Fuck Antifa.

4031
03:07:47,100 --> 03:07:48,100
Fuck Antifa.

4032
03:07:48,100 --> 03:07:49,100
Fuck Antifa.

4033
03:07:49,100 --> 03:07:50,100
And Tifa can burn the American flag if she can't burn this propaganda bullshit?

4034
03:07:50,100 --> 03:07:51,100
Yeah.

4035
03:07:51,100 --> 03:07:52,100
Yeah.

4036
03:07:52,100 --> 03:08:03,340
So yeah, the night before, Owen and Taylor had gotten together with a group of people

4037
03:08:03,340 --> 03:08:10,460
and doused a Black Lives Matter flag in lighter fluid, set it on fire, and chanted, fuck BLM,

4038
03:08:10,460 --> 03:08:11,460
BLM sucks.

4039
03:08:11,460 --> 03:08:14,900
Didn't we hear earlier Alex say that BLM isn't our enemy in a TV business?

4040
03:08:14,900 --> 03:08:15,900
No, Owen said that.

4041
03:08:15,900 --> 03:08:16,900
Oh, Owen said that.

4042
03:08:16,900 --> 03:08:17,900
Oh, that's odd.

4043
03:08:17,900 --> 03:08:18,960
The night before it burned their flag.

4044
03:08:18,960 --> 03:08:19,960
That's weird.

4045
03:08:19,960 --> 03:08:20,960
Yeah.

4046
03:08:20,960 --> 03:08:21,960
That's weird.

4047
03:08:21,960 --> 03:08:27,780
It's also weird how they're pretending that this is just a guy who got footage.

4048
03:08:27,780 --> 03:08:29,460
Just a patriot out there, Dan.

4049
03:08:29,460 --> 03:08:31,700
Or maybe an Antifa provocateur?

4050
03:08:31,700 --> 03:08:34,880
Hey everybody, Dan here.

4051
03:08:34,880 --> 03:08:39,900
Just wanted to drop in to make a little bit of a correction here.

4052
03:08:39,900 --> 03:08:49,340
There is something going on here, definitely, about this dude, Taylor, who Alex is interviewing.

4053
03:08:49,340 --> 03:08:50,940
But I messed something up.

4054
03:08:50,940 --> 03:08:54,980
I mixed something up and that is my fault and I'd just like to correct that.

4055
03:08:54,980 --> 03:08:59,100
I didn't realize this until after we'd recorded the episode, but I didn't want to take it

4056
03:08:59,100 --> 03:09:02,300
out but at the same time I didn't want anyone to get the wrong idea.

4057
03:09:02,300 --> 03:09:10,620
There were actually two videos that are being referenced and it's very unclear and I made

4058
03:09:10,620 --> 03:09:12,040
a hasty assumption.

4059
03:09:12,040 --> 03:09:20,420
There was an Infowars camera person who was filming at the Capitol when people had stormed

4060
03:09:20,420 --> 03:09:23,220
and the shooting did take place.

4061
03:09:23,220 --> 03:09:30,580
And in addition to that, Taylor Hanson was also there and he had shot some video.

4062
03:09:30,580 --> 03:09:37,260
So I apologize for the mistake, there's no indication necessarily that Taylor himself

4063
03:09:37,260 --> 03:09:42,940
is an Infowars employee, although very much clearly an Infowars associate in as much as

4064
03:09:42,940 --> 03:09:51,100
he's hanging out in Owen Troyer's hotel room and he is on video the night before, setting

4065
03:09:51,100 --> 03:09:54,260
a Black Lives Matter flag on fire with Owen.

4066
03:09:54,260 --> 03:09:59,100
So there's something going on that was really confusing about the social dynamics between

4067
03:09:59,100 --> 03:10:06,940
pretending he was a stranger to them, when in fact he was very well known to them, and

4068
03:10:06,940 --> 03:10:13,340
the multiple people recording stuff, it was very, it was a mess.

4069
03:10:13,340 --> 03:10:18,060
Anyway, sorry I got that mixed up, now back to the episode.

4070
03:10:18,060 --> 03:10:22,780
The next day after this, Taylor Hanson was a guest on Laura Ingraham's show.

4071
03:10:22,780 --> 03:10:24,420
Taylor better be really careful.

4072
03:10:24,420 --> 03:10:28,180
I certainly hope that the video showing him burning a Black Lives Matter flag the night

4073
03:10:28,180 --> 03:10:32,180
before doesn't paint his journalistic intentions as being a little bit iffy.

4074
03:10:32,180 --> 03:10:35,460
I would imagine that he and Alex should be really concerned right now about him getting

4075
03:10:35,460 --> 03:10:40,340
arrested for illegal entry into the Capitol building because he was clearly not there

4076
03:10:40,340 --> 03:10:41,860
as some kind of an objective journalist.

4077
03:10:41,860 --> 03:10:44,300
No, no, no, he's pressed, Dan, he's pressed.

4078
03:10:44,300 --> 03:10:48,060
He's an Infowars employee who was trying to get a sizzle reel.

4079
03:10:48,060 --> 03:10:53,020
What, are you against the freedom of the press now, Dan?

4080
03:10:53,020 --> 03:10:59,220
So they'll get to this interview in a little bit, but Alex wants to play the video first,

4081
03:10:59,220 --> 03:11:00,220
right?

4082
03:11:00,220 --> 03:11:04,380
And he's really excited to play this video, but not so excited that he doesn't get distracted.

4083
03:11:04,380 --> 03:11:09,100
They're like, Trump caused violence, Trump's bad, remove him, blah, blah, they're not telling

4084
03:11:09,100 --> 03:11:13,860
you they executed a woman, I got Joe Rogan calling me, let's just take this call.

4085
03:11:13,860 --> 03:11:15,740
Hey Joe, how you doing?

4086
03:11:15,740 --> 03:11:16,740
Alex.

4087
03:11:16,740 --> 03:11:23,300
I am there, I'm in the middle of it.

4088
03:11:23,300 --> 03:11:24,300
So that's jarring.

4089
03:11:24,300 --> 03:11:25,300
Yeah.

4090
03:11:25,300 --> 03:11:27,060
They play the video of her getting shot while Alex is.

4091
03:11:27,060 --> 03:11:30,020
While Alex is on the phone, that's what the shot was?

4092
03:11:30,020 --> 03:11:31,020
Yep.

4093
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:36,540
So you play that, cause Alex had already been setting up the clip, and now he's gotten a

4094
03:11:36,540 --> 03:11:41,220
call from Rogan that he can't not answer, so he wants to interview Rogan, cause he has

4095
03:11:41,220 --> 03:11:46,460
him on speakerphone, but apparently they go, like in the feed, they don't have Rogan's

4096
03:11:46,460 --> 03:11:50,500
call on there, which I think is probably good, cause they don't have his permission.

4097
03:11:50,500 --> 03:11:52,140
Cause they didn't ask her permission yet.

4098
03:11:52,140 --> 03:11:53,140
Yeah.

4099
03:11:53,140 --> 03:11:54,140
Yeah.

4100
03:11:54,140 --> 03:11:55,140
And so Alex gets a little frustrated.

4101
03:11:55,140 --> 03:11:56,140
Call him back.

4102
03:11:56,140 --> 03:12:03,100
It's weird, I have such a great crew, but these remotes are very interesting.

4103
03:12:03,100 --> 03:12:09,260
They're very interesting, cause they're just seizing up constantly, just seizing, seizing,

4104
03:12:09,260 --> 03:12:10,260
seizing.

4105
03:12:10,260 --> 03:12:11,260
Try again.

4106
03:12:11,260 --> 03:12:12,260
We're live.

4107
03:12:12,260 --> 03:12:13,260
That's great.

4108
03:12:13,260 --> 03:12:14,260
This is all real.

4109
03:12:14,260 --> 03:12:18,860
I'm here while they're killing people down there, so everything's good.

4110
03:12:18,860 --> 03:12:23,020
Roll the footage without me talking over it, two and a half minutes, I have a timer.

4111
03:12:23,020 --> 03:12:25,140
It's already played.

4112
03:12:25,140 --> 03:12:31,260
I do think that he seems more interested in getting Rogan on than he is in this footage.

4113
03:12:31,260 --> 03:12:32,260
Yeah.

4114
03:12:32,260 --> 03:12:33,260
It's disrespectful.

4115
03:12:33,260 --> 03:12:34,260
No, no, no, no, no.

4116
03:12:34,260 --> 03:12:39,020
The martyr, the Maga martyr, uh, she's gonna galvanize it.

4117
03:12:39,020 --> 03:12:40,020
Hold on.

4118
03:12:40,020 --> 03:12:41,020
I got to take this call.

4119
03:12:41,020 --> 03:12:42,020
It's Joe.

4120
03:12:42,020 --> 03:12:43,020
It's a famous person.

4121
03:12:43,020 --> 03:12:46,780
Now this Maga martyr, she's going to inspire the rebel, but I got to take a Joe Rogan call

4122
03:12:46,780 --> 03:12:47,780
real quick.

4123
03:12:47,780 --> 03:12:50,940
Joe Rogan, I don't know if you know this, uh, is a comedian.

4124
03:12:50,940 --> 03:12:56,900
So the Maga martyr, uh, fighting the little Christian devil, uh, hero, but I got to talk

4125
03:12:56,900 --> 03:13:00,460
to Joe Rogan, professional comedian.

4126
03:13:00,460 --> 03:13:05,100
So now that that is out of the way and he can't get Rogan back on the phone, Alex decides,

4127
03:13:05,100 --> 03:13:09,220
fuck it, I'll interview Taylor, uh, and pretend that I don't know him.

4128
03:13:09,220 --> 03:13:10,220
Wild.

4129
03:13:10,220 --> 03:13:11,220
Sir, thanks for being here with us.

4130
03:13:11,220 --> 03:13:12,220
Tell us who you are.

4131
03:13:12,220 --> 03:13:13,340
Tell us what you witnessed.

4132
03:13:13,340 --> 03:13:14,660
My name is Taylor Hansen.

4133
03:13:14,660 --> 03:13:20,620
I'm an independent journalist and she was the first one that actually had, uh, had headed

4134
03:13:20,620 --> 03:13:21,620
into that hall.

4135
03:13:21,620 --> 03:13:22,860
I was right behind her.

4136
03:13:22,860 --> 03:13:24,240
This is nonsense.

4137
03:13:24,240 --> 03:13:26,540
Why are they pretending that they don't know each other?

4138
03:13:26,540 --> 03:13:28,380
Like literally listen to this, listen to this.

4139
03:13:28,380 --> 03:13:30,460
This is just a little bit later.

4140
03:13:30,460 --> 03:13:32,180
I was sitting with Taylor last night in my room.

4141
03:13:32,180 --> 03:13:33,540
We were watching them steal the Jordan.

4142
03:13:33,540 --> 03:13:35,340
I mean, you, I mean, I said it's over.

4143
03:13:35,340 --> 03:13:38,140
Even when the Republicans were at, we were both like, we literally watched them do a

4144
03:13:38,140 --> 03:13:39,140
switch.

4145
03:13:39,140 --> 03:13:42,380
When we first sit down and watched it, Owen and Taylor were clearly friends.

4146
03:13:42,380 --> 03:13:45,600
They were hanging out in their hotel room last night.

4147
03:13:45,600 --> 03:13:47,220
It's so bizarre.

4148
03:13:47,220 --> 03:13:53,140
So Owen's got an interesting theory at this point about the stealing of the election.

4149
03:13:53,140 --> 03:13:54,140
Sure.

4150
03:13:54,140 --> 03:13:56,340
Oh, by the way, we're not going to listen to much of Taylor cause he's really boring

4151
03:13:56,340 --> 03:13:58,340
outside of the fact that it's clearly a charade.

4152
03:13:58,340 --> 03:14:00,940
It's clearly a ridiculous dance.

4153
03:14:00,940 --> 03:14:01,940
Yeah.

4154
03:14:01,940 --> 03:14:03,300
This is an interesting theory.

4155
03:14:03,300 --> 03:14:10,520
I think that Owen suspects that the communist Chinese are going through an elaborate conspiracy

4156
03:14:10,520 --> 03:14:13,060
just to make him mad.

4157
03:14:13,060 --> 03:14:15,260
The election is completely fake.

4158
03:14:15,260 --> 03:14:16,780
It's not that they steal elections.

4159
03:14:16,780 --> 03:14:18,100
Of course they steal elections.

4160
03:14:18,100 --> 03:14:23,260
They rigged this election last night to make it look like they stole it intentionally and

4161
03:14:23,260 --> 03:14:27,620
to make it look like it's close intentionally, all being done by the Chinese who run the

4162
03:14:27,620 --> 03:14:33,260
voting machines so that they could get this anger, get this ill sentiment, get these fake

4163
03:14:33,260 --> 03:14:39,260
people in, and then have us mad that they just stole our presidency and stole our Senate.

4164
03:14:39,260 --> 03:14:40,500
Yeah, man.

4165
03:14:40,500 --> 03:14:42,980
That's pretty, that's pretty ambitious as a conspiracy theory.

4166
03:14:42,980 --> 03:14:50,140
So if I understand correctly, the globalists both made the election look like they stole

4167
03:14:50,140 --> 03:14:51,140
it.

4168
03:14:51,140 --> 03:14:52,140
Yes.

4169
03:14:52,140 --> 03:14:57,580
While at the same time actually making the election look as though we're close while

4170
03:14:57,580 --> 03:15:00,540
at the same time actually stealing it.

4171
03:15:00,540 --> 03:15:01,540
Yes.

4172
03:15:01,540 --> 03:15:04,460
And they wanted to make it close because they knew if it wasn't close, it wouldn't anger

4173
03:15:04,460 --> 03:15:06,460
people like Owen.

4174
03:15:06,460 --> 03:15:09,820
And it had to be obvious that it was stolen cause that would also piss them off quite

4175
03:15:09,820 --> 03:15:10,820
a bit.

4176
03:15:10,820 --> 03:15:13,900
Cause it was a come from behind victory cause it was one of those gut punch losses, you

4177
03:15:13,900 --> 03:15:14,900
know?

4178
03:15:14,900 --> 03:15:21,620
It's like when LeBron sunk that three to knock out my beloved Bulls.

4179
03:15:21,620 --> 03:15:26,260
They're imagining that like she is just sitting around and being like, Owen's going to hate

4180
03:15:26,260 --> 03:15:27,260
this.

4181
03:15:27,260 --> 03:15:28,260
Owen's going to be so pissed.

4182
03:15:28,260 --> 03:15:31,160
Oh, he's not going to like this one.

4183
03:15:31,160 --> 03:15:35,180
So they'd, they covered Trump's video that he put out.

4184
03:15:35,180 --> 03:15:40,620
I'm guessing you saw that where he called everyone special and I love you all go home.

4185
03:15:40,620 --> 03:15:41,620
Yeah.

4186
03:15:41,620 --> 03:15:42,620
Yeah.

4187
03:15:42,620 --> 03:15:43,620
That was great.

4188
03:15:43,620 --> 03:15:44,620
That was a really good way to de-escalate.

4189
03:15:44,620 --> 03:15:45,620
Fucked up.

4190
03:15:45,620 --> 03:15:46,620
Hey, listen, they stole it.

4191
03:15:46,620 --> 03:15:49,660
Everything you're doing is right and I love you, but it's time to go home.

4192
03:15:49,660 --> 03:15:50,660
Yeah.

4193
03:15:50,660 --> 03:15:51,660
It's 6 PM guys.

4194
03:15:51,660 --> 03:15:52,860
Fucked up.

4195
03:15:52,860 --> 03:15:55,740
So they do cover that, but it's basically exactly what you would expect.

4196
03:15:55,740 --> 03:15:56,740
Yeah.

4197
03:15:56,740 --> 03:16:00,600
The only thing that I find shocking is after Trump had put out that video, he more or less

4198
03:16:00,600 --> 03:16:02,900
tweeted something pretty similar.

4199
03:16:02,900 --> 03:16:03,900
Yeah.

4200
03:16:03,900 --> 03:16:07,060
And even Tom Papert is shocked by this tweet.

4201
03:16:07,060 --> 03:16:08,060
Listen to this.

4202
03:16:08,060 --> 03:16:10,220
Tom is like, what?

4203
03:16:10,220 --> 03:16:14,380
We just have a, a breaking a tweet from the president.

4204
03:16:14,380 --> 03:16:18,900
President Trump tweets, which is one of his first tweets of the day.

4205
03:16:18,900 --> 03:16:19,900
Really?

4206
03:16:19,900 --> 03:16:21,900
These are, wow.

4207
03:16:21,900 --> 03:16:23,380
President Donald Trump breaking.

4208
03:16:23,380 --> 03:16:28,340
These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is

4209
03:16:28,340 --> 03:16:34,620
so unceremoniously and viciously stripped away from great Patriots who have been badly

4210
03:16:34,620 --> 03:16:37,820
and unfairly treated for so long.

4211
03:16:37,820 --> 03:16:40,180
Tom Papert's a shithead and he believes all that stuff.

4212
03:16:40,180 --> 03:16:43,000
And even he was like, holy shit, Trump said that.

4213
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:45,860
So then how is it Antifa agents?

4214
03:16:45,860 --> 03:16:46,860
I guess it can't be.

4215
03:16:46,860 --> 03:16:47,860
I don't know.

4216
03:16:47,860 --> 03:16:50,260
These people are, it's all just like, whatever.

4217
03:16:50,260 --> 03:16:51,260
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

4218
03:16:51,260 --> 03:16:52,260
Let's do all of it.

4219
03:16:52,260 --> 03:16:53,260
Yeah.

4220
03:16:53,260 --> 03:16:54,260
100%.

4221
03:16:54,260 --> 03:16:56,900
Throw it all out there tonight and then we'll pick something to stick with tomorrow.

4222
03:16:56,900 --> 03:16:57,900
Yeah.

4223
03:16:57,900 --> 03:16:58,900
And at this point.

4224
03:16:58,900 --> 03:16:59,900
That's shameful.

4225
03:16:59,900 --> 03:17:00,900
That should not be.

4226
03:17:00,900 --> 03:17:05,300
That's I know it's, look, we're on sin 10,000, but I mean, really.

4227
03:17:05,300 --> 03:17:06,300
It's our fourth anniversary.

4228
03:17:06,300 --> 03:17:07,300
Yeah.

4229
03:17:07,300 --> 03:17:08,300
That's fucked up.

4230
03:17:08,300 --> 03:17:09,300
Yeah.

4231
03:17:09,300 --> 03:17:10,300
That's crazy.

4232
03:17:10,300 --> 03:17:11,300
Yeah.

4233
03:17:11,300 --> 03:17:18,940
So, um, Alex is really trying to push home this idea that the woman who got shot is going

4234
03:17:18,940 --> 03:17:20,700
to be covered up by the media.

4235
03:17:20,700 --> 03:17:22,080
The media is not going to talk about it.

4236
03:17:22,080 --> 03:17:27,100
Just going to pretend that didn't happen because it's too threatening to the globalists because

4237
03:17:27,100 --> 03:17:30,620
she's a martyr for the cause of the Patriots and the revolutionaries.

4238
03:17:30,620 --> 03:17:31,620
I'm sorry.

4239
03:17:31,620 --> 03:17:33,140
I would love to hear more about her, but I got to take this call.

4240
03:17:33,140 --> 03:17:34,460
Joe, Joe Rogan is calling me.

4241
03:17:34,460 --> 03:17:37,860
No, I know I care about the martyr, but I got to take this call.

4242
03:17:37,860 --> 03:17:38,860
So Trump's the real deal.

4243
03:17:38,860 --> 03:17:39,860
One in a landslide.

4244
03:17:39,860 --> 03:17:40,860
One in a landslide.

4245
03:17:40,860 --> 03:17:42,620
We got to find this woman's name.

4246
03:17:42,620 --> 03:17:46,860
Does anybody know name of the woman killed in DC?

4247
03:17:46,860 --> 03:17:49,180
Name of the woman killed in DC.

4248
03:17:49,180 --> 03:17:51,500
Name of the woman killed in DC.

4249
03:17:51,500 --> 03:17:52,900
Name of the woman killed in DC.

4250
03:17:52,900 --> 03:17:53,900
Say her name.

4251
03:17:53,900 --> 03:17:54,900
Say her name.

4252
03:17:54,900 --> 03:17:55,900
Say her name.

4253
03:17:55,900 --> 03:17:57,900
Cause we, cause they're not going to want us to know.

4254
03:17:57,900 --> 03:17:58,900
No.

4255
03:17:58,900 --> 03:17:59,900
They're gonna try to suppress us for a while.

4256
03:17:59,900 --> 03:18:04,180
By this point, uh, people were already figured out who she was on Twitter and everything's

4257
03:18:04,180 --> 03:18:05,180
fine.

4258
03:18:05,180 --> 03:18:06,180
We know where she lives.

4259
03:18:06,180 --> 03:18:07,180
Yeah.

4260
03:18:07,180 --> 03:18:08,420
Uh, that other voice is Ali Alexander.

4261
03:18:08,420 --> 03:18:10,180
She is also hanging out on the roof of this hotel.

4262
03:18:10,180 --> 03:18:11,180
Of course.

4263
03:18:11,180 --> 03:18:14,500
They're all just getting drunk after a fucking boat parade.

4264
03:18:14,500 --> 03:18:15,500
It does seem that way.

4265
03:18:15,500 --> 03:18:16,500
That is what's happening.

4266
03:18:16,500 --> 03:18:17,500
Yes.

4267
03:18:17,500 --> 03:18:18,500
These people are fucking stupid.

4268
03:18:18,500 --> 03:18:19,500
It does seem that way.

4269
03:18:19,500 --> 03:18:23,020
So Alex tries to sign off here cause he's, uh, he's done it.

4270
03:18:23,020 --> 03:18:24,020
He's tired.

4271
03:18:24,020 --> 03:18:25,020
It's been a long day.

4272
03:18:25,020 --> 03:18:26,820
He took a little walk leading that parade earlier.

4273
03:18:26,820 --> 03:18:29,940
I know it's hard to remember that happened on this episode.

4274
03:18:29,940 --> 03:18:36,580
Um, but uh, yeah, so he's signing off and uh, they seem like they really care about

4275
03:18:36,580 --> 03:18:38,540
this woman who got shot.

4276
03:18:38,540 --> 03:18:41,220
They're demonizing Trump with this narrative.

4277
03:18:41,220 --> 03:18:42,900
They're demonizing that he caused the violence.

4278
03:18:42,900 --> 03:18:44,740
No, protesting is good.

4279
03:18:44,740 --> 03:18:45,740
We were peaceful.

4280
03:18:45,740 --> 03:18:48,940
The federal police attacked the protesters first, eliciting a response.

4281
03:18:48,940 --> 03:18:51,900
Now they killed a woman in cold blood and they hope nobody gets that out, but you're

4282
03:18:51,900 --> 03:18:55,260
going to get that out.

4283
03:18:55,260 --> 03:18:57,220
Truly sad what's going on here.

4284
03:18:57,220 --> 03:19:02,740
Well, they, they just full of empathy and care for their common person, their fellow

4285
03:19:02,740 --> 03:19:04,260
human.

4286
03:19:04,260 --> 03:19:08,220
So Alex is signing off, but he throws it to Owen to wrap it up.

4287
03:19:08,220 --> 03:19:09,220
Oh, of course.

4288
03:19:09,220 --> 03:19:11,780
Cause they still got a little time on the war room or something.

4289
03:19:11,780 --> 03:19:12,780
I don't know.

4290
03:19:12,780 --> 03:19:13,780
That's necessary.

4291
03:19:13,780 --> 03:19:16,020
People are definitely going to want to make sure they get the last 10 minutes of this

4292
03:19:16,020 --> 03:19:17,020
shit.

4293
03:19:17,020 --> 03:19:18,020
Yeah.

4294
03:19:18,020 --> 03:19:19,020
Yeah.

4295
03:19:19,020 --> 03:19:20,020
So Alex is gone.

4296
03:19:20,020 --> 03:19:21,020
Yeah.

4297
03:19:21,020 --> 03:19:22,020
Theoretically.

4298
03:19:22,020 --> 03:19:25,900
Owen tries to get reflective about like, what do we call this?

4299
03:19:25,900 --> 03:19:28,220
What do we call what's happened?

4300
03:19:28,220 --> 03:19:32,080
I'm wondering what to call this situation.

4301
03:19:32,080 --> 03:19:38,660
So we pushing and pushing and pushing and no one ever pushes back and they freak out

4302
03:19:38,660 --> 03:19:39,660
when we push back.

4303
03:19:39,660 --> 03:19:40,760
They burn the country down.

4304
03:19:40,760 --> 03:19:43,980
We push back, they kill a woman and we're the bad guys.

4305
03:19:43,980 --> 03:19:45,620
Don't you take our kindness for weakness.

4306
03:19:45,620 --> 03:19:46,620
You are the bad guy.

4307
03:19:46,620 --> 03:19:47,620
Go ahead.

4308
03:19:47,620 --> 03:19:48,620
I'm sorry.

4309
03:19:48,620 --> 03:19:49,620
So wait, was it Antifa or not?

4310
03:19:49,620 --> 03:19:54,200
Wait, did you just barged back in to yell that the globalists don't like it when you

4311
03:19:54,200 --> 03:19:55,900
push back and what?

4312
03:19:55,900 --> 03:19:56,940
That's the problem.

4313
03:19:56,940 --> 03:20:01,900
They want a violent revolution, but it looks stupid and they can't make money off of it.

4314
03:20:01,900 --> 03:20:02,900
Yeah.

4315
03:20:02,900 --> 03:20:03,900
So now we're trapped.

4316
03:20:03,900 --> 03:20:04,900
Yeah.

4317
03:20:04,900 --> 03:20:05,900
They want it both ways.

4318
03:20:05,900 --> 03:20:06,900
Yeah.

4319
03:20:06,900 --> 03:20:07,900
And it's no good.

4320
03:20:07,900 --> 03:20:10,420
And they also want their violent revolution to be non-violent for them.

4321
03:20:10,420 --> 03:20:13,500
They want to play a video game in god mode.

4322
03:20:13,500 --> 03:20:16,060
They don't want to actually, oh, it's just like fucking democracy.

4323
03:20:16,060 --> 03:20:19,660
Oh, we live in a republic, but I don't want to risk losing an election.

4324
03:20:19,660 --> 03:20:20,660
Sure.

4325
03:20:20,660 --> 03:20:21,660
You know?

4326
03:20:21,660 --> 03:20:22,660
The tyranny of the majority.

4327
03:20:22,660 --> 03:20:23,660
Oh, I can't stand that.

4328
03:20:23,660 --> 03:20:24,660
But I mean, yeah.

4329
03:20:24,660 --> 03:20:28,840
So Owen wants to wrap up now because he was only supposed to say a few more things and

4330
03:20:28,840 --> 03:20:30,420
Alex won't let him.

4331
03:20:30,420 --> 03:20:34,780
A million or at least, I mean half a million minimum at the Trump rally by 9 a.m. today,

4332
03:20:34,780 --> 03:20:38,440
they sat there and stood there, cheered all day long for all the great speakers and then

4333
03:20:38,440 --> 03:20:43,480
president Trump, president Trump was on the phone with Mike Pence before he spoke.

4334
03:20:43,480 --> 03:20:48,180
My guess is I don't, I mean, demanding, begging.

4335
03:20:48,180 --> 03:20:51,940
I've got some more witnesses to her getting executed and now that's what people got mad

4336
03:20:51,940 --> 03:20:52,940
and fought back.

4337
03:20:52,940 --> 03:20:53,940
So bring these guys in.

4338
03:20:53,940 --> 03:20:54,940
Bring this other chair in.

4339
03:20:54,940 --> 03:20:56,940
Hey guys, we're shutting down soon.

4340
03:20:56,940 --> 03:21:01,580
Come up here, you came here, pull your chair in right there, get up there with Owen.

4341
03:21:01,580 --> 03:21:02,580
Introduce yourself.

4342
03:21:02,580 --> 03:21:03,580
Go ahead, gentlemen.

4343
03:21:03,580 --> 03:21:04,580
So you got some more witnesses.

4344
03:21:04,580 --> 03:21:05,580
Oh boy.

4345
03:21:05,580 --> 03:21:07,220
So Owen tries to interview these people.

4346
03:21:07,220 --> 03:21:08,740
Also, Infowars employees.

4347
03:21:08,740 --> 03:21:10,420
It turns out they're not so much witnesses.

4348
03:21:10,420 --> 03:21:13,740
All right, so you guys were, you guys were in the Capitol today.

4349
03:21:13,740 --> 03:21:17,260
Um, are you guys both eyewitnesses to the lady's execution?

4350
03:21:17,260 --> 03:21:20,140
Uh, the immediate aftermath.

4351
03:21:20,140 --> 03:21:21,140
Yeah.

4352
03:21:21,140 --> 03:21:22,140
Okay.

4353
03:21:22,140 --> 03:21:24,140
So why don't you talk about what you saw?

4354
03:21:24,140 --> 03:21:28,340
Um, I don't, I mean, it was pandemonium there.

4355
03:21:28,340 --> 03:21:30,060
Yeah, you'd assume so.

4356
03:21:30,060 --> 03:21:31,060
Wild.

4357
03:21:31,060 --> 03:21:32,060
Yeah.

4358
03:21:32,060 --> 03:21:33,860
So you didn't actually see the thing that we're presenting you as a witness of.

4359
03:21:33,860 --> 03:21:36,220
Well, I didn't see the per se.

4360
03:21:36,220 --> 03:21:40,700
Also, unfortunate, you guys have put yourself in a place you're not legally supposed to

4361
03:21:40,700 --> 03:21:41,900
have been.

4362
03:21:41,900 --> 03:21:46,540
And these witnesses are not witnesses, they're right-wing blog types.

4363
03:21:46,540 --> 03:21:50,740
One of them is Lucian Wintrick, who's the former White House correspondent working at

4364
03:21:50,740 --> 03:21:55,100
the Gateway Pundit, and somebody who's been on Infowars a bunch in the past.

4365
03:21:55,100 --> 03:21:58,460
There's no way that Alex and Owen don't know who he is, yet they're pretending that they

4366
03:21:58,460 --> 03:22:02,140
don't know each other, and it's just a random person who witnessed the shooting.

4367
03:22:02,140 --> 03:22:04,780
It's so bizarre that no one knows each other.

4368
03:22:04,780 --> 03:22:09,380
Also, the other guy, his name is Matthew Foster, I have no idea who he is, but he's probably

4369
03:22:09,380 --> 03:22:11,180
a shithead because he's hanging out with Lucian.

4370
03:22:11,180 --> 03:22:12,780
Yeah, that would make sense.

4371
03:22:12,780 --> 03:22:17,620
But like, both of them are now like, we were in there when that shooting happened, well,

4372
03:22:17,620 --> 03:22:18,620
guess what?

4373
03:22:18,620 --> 03:22:19,620
You committed a crime.

4374
03:22:19,620 --> 03:22:20,620
Hey, there you go.

4375
03:22:20,620 --> 03:22:25,340
So, a lot of people making these investigations pretty easy.

4376
03:22:25,340 --> 03:22:32,580
They really don't understand that they're wrong, and that crime is real, even if they

4377
03:22:32,580 --> 03:22:33,580
do it.

4378
03:22:33,580 --> 03:22:34,580
Yeah, yeah.

4379
03:22:34,580 --> 03:22:38,780
And I don't think white people can revolt in the United States, they're too goddamn

4380
03:22:38,780 --> 03:22:39,780
entitled.

4381
03:22:39,780 --> 03:22:45,900
And part of, you know, sort of non-violent civil disobedience is the recognition that

4382
03:22:45,900 --> 03:22:50,500
there will be consequences, and you will have to bear those consequences, and that's part

4383
03:22:50,500 --> 03:22:51,500
of it.

4384
03:22:51,500 --> 03:22:55,860
So like, if you're doing something where you invade the Senate chamber and you do a sit-in

4385
03:22:55,860 --> 03:23:00,500
or something like that, you recognize that there are consequences legally for that because

4386
03:23:00,500 --> 03:23:03,300
what you're doing is technically illegal.

4387
03:23:03,300 --> 03:23:10,660
And so these guys have decided to engage in some form of the protest that they feel is

4388
03:23:10,660 --> 03:23:11,660
appropriate.

4389
03:23:11,660 --> 03:23:14,340
They have committed crimes, and now they will have to bear it.

4390
03:23:14,340 --> 03:23:17,540
No, but they're not supposed to be illegal, and I'm not supposed to be punished for it,

4391
03:23:17,540 --> 03:23:18,540
Dan.

4392
03:23:18,540 --> 03:23:22,620
I have no feelings, Lucian, but unfortunately- No, but I'm the good guy.

4393
03:23:22,620 --> 03:23:24,100
There should be a warrant out for your arrest.

4394
03:23:24,100 --> 03:23:28,220
No, look, I'm the good guy, see, because they stole the election, I'm good.

4395
03:23:28,220 --> 03:23:32,640
Anyway, their interview is very boring, and we have one last clip where Alex encourages

4396
03:23:32,640 --> 03:23:36,300
Trump to use this woman's death as a weapon.

4397
03:23:36,300 --> 03:23:37,300
Sure.

4398
03:23:37,300 --> 03:23:40,460
I'm gonna call General Flynn, I'm gonna call Giuliani, I'm gonna call all my contacts and

4399
03:23:40,460 --> 03:23:42,340
Trump's lawyers.

4400
03:23:42,340 --> 03:23:45,900
Trump has to say, we had a great event with over a million people, it was all peaceful.

4401
03:23:45,900 --> 03:23:47,780
Riot police attacked folks, they pushed back a little.

4402
03:23:47,780 --> 03:23:51,020
If you want to arrest those people, that's fine, but you don't shoot him in the neck,

4403
03:23:51,020 --> 03:23:54,460
and he needs to know the name of that woman, and humanize her, and turn that against him,

4404
03:23:54,460 --> 03:23:57,340
because they're blaming Trump for everything right now, and 25th Amendment.

4405
03:23:57,340 --> 03:23:58,620
The fight is now.

4406
03:23:58,620 --> 03:24:01,500
So we're gonna end this transformation in five minutes with your final comments, Tom

4407
03:24:01,500 --> 03:24:04,980
Pappert's gonna take over, and then I'm gonna go to work tonight calling influencers and

4408
03:24:04,980 --> 03:24:08,460
tell the president, don't cuck on this, go on the offense.

4409
03:24:08,460 --> 03:24:10,100
Don't cuck on it.

4410
03:24:10,100 --> 03:24:15,060
Later in the evening, Alex did a report about how Pence is gonna invoke the 25th Amendment,

4411
03:24:15,060 --> 03:24:21,060
basically just taking Pappert's imagination and reporting it as news, and by that point

4412
03:24:21,060 --> 03:24:24,900
he still is unaware of what this lady's name is, and I know what her name is, but I just

4413
03:24:24,900 --> 03:24:28,220
don't care, I don't want to get involved.

4414
03:24:28,220 --> 03:24:36,960
If there is one skill that Donald Trump absolutely does not possess, it is getting people to

4415
03:24:36,960 --> 03:24:39,480
care about human life.

4416
03:24:39,480 --> 03:24:40,480
That is true.

4417
03:24:40,480 --> 03:24:46,820
So, if you are asking Donald Trump to shit all over her for being dead, and failing in

4418
03:24:46,820 --> 03:24:52,780
her mission, if you wanted the president to go on TV and say, he loves insurrectionists

4419
03:24:52,780 --> 03:24:56,340
who don't get shot by the cops, you can get that.

4420
03:24:56,340 --> 03:24:57,940
Yeah, he's skilled at that.

4421
03:24:57,940 --> 03:25:02,260
I don't think you're gonna get anybody being a martyr, but Trump.

4422
03:25:02,260 --> 03:25:08,220
Yeah, and if it's not personally involved him, I don't think he would care.

4423
03:25:08,220 --> 03:25:09,220
He doesn't give a shit.

4424
03:25:09,220 --> 03:25:16,460
So, I watched all this, and I lived inside this a bit, and it was really weird, because

4425
03:25:16,460 --> 03:25:21,180
I was experiencing a lot of stuff that was like what everyone else was experiencing,

4426
03:25:21,180 --> 03:25:29,260
and reality-based, and at the same time I was seeing and paying attention to the reportage

4427
03:25:29,260 --> 03:25:34,980
and what have you on Infowars, and the gap between the two is staggering.

4428
03:25:34,980 --> 03:25:44,500
And it really, I mean, lack of talent aside, because he had people like Papert and Harrison,

4429
03:25:44,500 --> 03:25:53,140
who just aren't good at this, that aside, there was a noticeable rockiness to trying

4430
03:25:53,140 --> 03:25:59,080
to figure out what to do, how to cover this, and then there was a singularity of purpose

4431
03:25:59,080 --> 03:26:04,900
that Alex had that I really felt, as I was listening to this, it fit that idea that he

4432
03:26:04,900 --> 03:26:07,380
is trying to create patriot lore.

4433
03:26:07,380 --> 03:26:14,100
He's trying to create a myth out of this, that is, this woman was murdered for the cause,

4434
03:26:14,100 --> 03:26:20,060
and the globalists shot her to make us look bad, Antifa probably agitated.

4435
03:26:20,060 --> 03:26:22,640
But also we were right to do the, yeah.

4436
03:26:22,640 --> 03:26:27,500
In case it wasn't Antifa, we were right to do it.

4437
03:26:27,500 --> 03:26:37,300
I felt the first pages of narratives and first pages of things that will affect people down

4438
03:26:37,300 --> 03:26:43,380
the road, be rallying cries for people in fucked up ways, and I hope that that's not

4439
03:26:43,380 --> 03:26:47,900
the case, but that is the general sense of what I felt Alex's intentions were.

4440
03:26:47,900 --> 03:26:52,560
Now, at the same time, everybody else around him is working across purposes.

4441
03:26:52,560 --> 03:26:55,220
Everyone else, I have no idea what the fuck they're doing.

4442
03:26:55,220 --> 03:26:56,980
Tom Papert seems insane.

4443
03:26:56,980 --> 03:26:57,980
He's nuts.

4444
03:26:57,980 --> 03:27:01,420
Harrison Smith seems like a true believer, Owen Troyer.

4445
03:27:01,420 --> 03:27:06,820
Splits the difference somewhere between just being angry and also wanting to make daddy

4446
03:27:06,820 --> 03:27:07,820
so happy.

4447
03:27:07,820 --> 03:27:08,820
Yeah.

4448
03:27:08,820 --> 03:27:12,100
So he's like, I want to kill everybody, but also daddy needs money, so I'm going to back

4449
03:27:12,100 --> 03:27:14,800
off because he said so, but I do want to kill everybody.

4450
03:27:14,800 --> 03:27:18,020
And also I've recently realized that I'm pretty good at standup comedy.

4451
03:27:18,020 --> 03:27:19,020
I'm pretty great.

4452
03:27:19,020 --> 03:27:20,860
I got one bit, give me 15.

4453
03:27:20,860 --> 03:27:21,860
Yeah.

4454
03:27:21,860 --> 03:27:26,340
Hey, look, I'm unemployable if Info Wars goes away, self-employed is a comic, baby.

4455
03:27:26,340 --> 03:27:27,340
That's where the money is.

4456
03:27:27,340 --> 03:27:29,620
I know this guy named Joe.

4457
03:27:29,620 --> 03:27:31,780
He made millions doing standup.

4458
03:27:31,780 --> 03:27:35,900
I'm going to go on tour with Nick DiPaolo.

4459
03:27:35,900 --> 03:27:36,900
Everything's going to be all right.

4460
03:27:36,900 --> 03:27:39,780
I'm going to middle for Rob Schneider.

4461
03:27:39,780 --> 03:27:49,620
So I think that we've taken a bit of a, I don't know, maybe a lighter tone than maybe

4462
03:27:49,620 --> 03:27:53,300
some people would feel and maybe lighter than I feel at times.

4463
03:27:53,300 --> 03:27:54,300
Sure, sure.

4464
03:27:54,300 --> 03:28:00,340
And I think a part of that is just, we're looking at Alex and this is scary, but he's

4465
03:28:00,340 --> 03:28:01,540
also a fucking idiot.

4466
03:28:01,540 --> 03:28:02,540
Right.

4467
03:28:02,540 --> 03:28:03,540
And this is idiotic.

4468
03:28:03,540 --> 03:28:04,540
Right.

4469
03:28:04,540 --> 03:28:14,640
And I'm, yeah, I mean, I'm in a place, I feel like I am coming at this from a completely

4470
03:28:14,640 --> 03:28:17,880
different point of view than everyone.

4471
03:28:17,880 --> 03:28:18,880
And it freaks me out.

4472
03:28:18,880 --> 03:28:23,360
I feel a little insane because I have never felt more confident that we are not going

4473
03:28:23,360 --> 03:28:30,460
to be overthrown because the reality of actually overthrowing the United States is that you

4474
03:28:30,460 --> 03:28:33,340
would have to have the military on your side.

4475
03:28:33,340 --> 03:28:38,760
And the most important thing about the military is that it is an arm of the economy.

4476
03:28:38,760 --> 03:28:44,520
And there's no way that the economy is going to be collapsed by those fucking morons.

4477
03:28:44,520 --> 03:28:49,540
And there's no way that the military leadership who could, I mean, it's entirely conceivable

4478
03:28:49,540 --> 03:28:55,640
that that could have, that a coup could have happened if it was planned appropriately,

4479
03:28:55,640 --> 03:29:01,400
if the military saw signals that this is actually some real shit, if Trump didn't fucking run

4480
03:29:01,400 --> 03:29:02,520
away like a coward.

4481
03:29:02,520 --> 03:29:03,520
Right.

4482
03:29:03,520 --> 03:29:07,360
And if the right wing politicians, if the right wing politicians who are all up in arms

4483
03:29:07,360 --> 03:29:14,040
about doing anything like that, if they joined the rally, I, all bets could be off.

4484
03:29:14,040 --> 03:29:20,320
But everybody who's important in terms of running the world saw those people do that

4485
03:29:20,320 --> 03:29:24,340
shit and went, oh fuck, they did it too soon.

4486
03:29:24,340 --> 03:29:27,480
They blew their wad too early and now they're an embarrassment.

4487
03:29:27,480 --> 03:29:28,480
Yeah.

4488
03:29:28,480 --> 03:29:33,600
I see where you're coming from and I think that I can agree on the, on the sort of short

4489
03:29:33,600 --> 03:29:34,600
scale.

4490
03:29:34,600 --> 03:29:35,600
Sure.

4491
03:29:35,600 --> 03:29:36,600
Sure.

4492
03:29:36,600 --> 03:29:37,600
The fear, the fear is the longer scale.

4493
03:29:37,600 --> 03:29:43,000
The lessons that can be learned by the very serious people who are among these groups

4494
03:29:43,000 --> 03:29:50,300
of ding dongs, the lessons that you can take from this, the image of, you know, these people

4495
03:29:50,300 --> 03:29:56,000
flying Confederate flags, invading the fucking capital.

4496
03:29:56,000 --> 03:29:58,420
It's meaningful from an optics standpoint.

4497
03:29:58,420 --> 03:29:59,540
It's emboldening.

4498
03:29:59,540 --> 03:30:06,500
And so even if it doesn't encourage an actual like coup, those are the sorts of imagery

4499
03:30:06,500 --> 03:30:11,560
and the sort of things that you would need in order to inspire people to take other kinds

4500
03:30:11,560 --> 03:30:13,520
of actions that could be destructive.

4501
03:30:13,520 --> 03:30:14,520
Right.

4502
03:30:14,520 --> 03:30:15,520
Yeah.

4503
03:30:15,520 --> 03:30:16,520
I don't know.

4504
03:30:16,520 --> 03:30:17,520
I don't know.

4505
03:30:17,520 --> 03:30:18,520
Yeah.

4506
03:30:18,520 --> 03:30:19,520
Let's, let's, let's not go crazy.

4507
03:30:19,520 --> 03:30:20,520
Yeah.

4508
03:30:20,520 --> 03:30:21,520
Yeah.

4509
03:30:21,520 --> 03:30:24,400
But I hope everyone is doing all right out there.

4510
03:30:24,400 --> 03:30:28,960
We will find out what happened after this on Monday.

4511
03:30:28,960 --> 03:30:31,440
We'll figure out whatever Alex decided.

4512
03:30:31,440 --> 03:30:32,440
Maybe it was Antifa.

4513
03:30:32,440 --> 03:30:33,440
Maybe it's not.

4514
03:30:33,440 --> 03:30:34,440
Who knows?

4515
03:30:34,440 --> 03:30:40,480
We'll see if by the next day Alex had figured out who this woman was.

4516
03:30:40,480 --> 03:30:41,760
And yeah.

4517
03:30:41,760 --> 03:30:43,200
But then, but until then we have a website.

4518
03:30:43,200 --> 03:30:44,200
We do have a website.

4519
03:30:44,200 --> 03:30:45,200
It's knowledgefight.com.

4520
03:30:45,200 --> 03:30:46,200
Yeah.

4521
03:30:46,200 --> 03:30:47,200
We're also on Twitter.

4522
03:30:47,200 --> 03:30:48,200
We are on Twitter.

4523
03:30:48,200 --> 03:30:49,200
It's at knowledgefight.net.

4524
03:30:49,200 --> 03:30:50,200
Go to bed Jordan.

4525
03:30:50,200 --> 03:30:51,200
We're also on Facebook.

4526
03:30:51,200 --> 03:30:52,200
We are on Facebook.

4527
03:30:52,200 --> 03:30:55,280
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

4528
03:30:55,280 --> 03:30:56,480
doing God's work right now.

4529
03:30:56,480 --> 03:30:57,480
Yeah.

4530
03:30:57,480 --> 03:30:58,480
We'll be back.

4531
03:30:58,480 --> 03:31:01,800
But until then, I'm Leo.

4532
03:31:01,800 --> 03:31:02,800
I'm Leo.

4533
03:31:02,800 --> 03:31:03,800
I'm DZX Clark.

4534
03:31:03,800 --> 03:31:04,800
I'm Daryl Rundis.

4535
03:31:04,800 --> 03:31:06,960
I'm the juiciest ice cube.

4536
03:31:06,960 --> 03:31:07,960
Andy in Kansas.

4537
03:31:07,960 --> 03:31:08,960
You're on the air.

4538
03:31:08,960 --> 03:31:11,520
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller.

4539
03:31:11,520 --> 03:31:12,520
I'm a huge fan.

4540
03:31:12,520 --> 03:31:13,520
I love your work.

4541
03:31:13,520 --> 03:31:14,520
I love you.

4542
03:31:14,520 --> 03:31:43,520
Thank you so much for being with us today, and I'll see you in the next one.
