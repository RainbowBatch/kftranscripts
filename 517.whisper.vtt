N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.880 --> 00:19.520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.360
I have great respect for knowledgefight.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.360
Knowledgefight.

00:25.360 --> 00:29.280
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.280
Knowledgefight.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.280
Dan and Jordan.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.280
Knowledgefight.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.280
Riddle her.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.280
Riddle her.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.280
Riddle her.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.280
Riddle her.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.280
Need money.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.280
Riddle her.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.280
Riddle her.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.280
Riddle her.

00:40.280 --> 00:41.280
Andy and Kansas.

00:41.280 --> 00:42.280
Andy and Kansas.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.280
Stop it.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.280
Andy and Kansas.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.280
Andy and Kansas.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.280
Andy and Kansas.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.280
It's time to pray.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.280
Andy and Kansas.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.280
You're on the air.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.280
Thanks for holding.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.280
Hello Alex.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.280
I'm a first time caller.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.280
I'm a huge fan.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.280
I love your room.

00:54.280 --> 00:55.280
Knowledgefight.

00:55.280 --> 00:56.280
N-N-N-N-N-Knowledgefight.com.

00:56.280 --> 00:59.400
I love you.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.400
Hey everybody.

01:00.400 --> 01:01.400
Welcome back to Knowledgefight.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.400
I'm Dan.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.400
I'm Jordan.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.400
We're a couple dudes.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.200
We like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.400
Oh indeed we are Dan.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.400
Jordan.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.400
Dan.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.400
Jordan.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.400
Quick question for you.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.400
What's up?

01:12.400 --> 01:13.400
What's your bright spot today?

01:13.400 --> 01:14.960
My bright spot today, Jordan, is a happy anniversary for our show.

01:14.960 --> 01:15.960
Oh that's right.

01:15.960 --> 01:16.960
It is our anniversary.

01:16.960 --> 01:17.960
We are recording this.

01:17.960 --> 01:18.960
January 7th.

01:18.960 --> 01:19.960
Yes.

01:19.960 --> 01:20.960
Four years ago.

01:20.960 --> 01:21.960
It's crazy.

01:21.960 --> 01:22.960
Our first episode came out.

01:22.960 --> 01:23.960
What are we doing?

01:23.960 --> 01:24.960
I don't know.

01:24.960 --> 01:25.960
How dare we do this for four years?

01:25.960 --> 01:26.960
I'm mad at us.

01:26.960 --> 01:27.960
What is it?

01:27.960 --> 01:28.960
Yeah.

01:28.960 --> 01:29.960
Yeah.

01:29.960 --> 01:30.960
Shit.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.960
Somehow we are also a cancer on this world.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.840
Oh, dammit.

01:34.840 --> 01:41.320
That was unexpected four years ago, but here we are and it's been a fun ride at times.

01:41.320 --> 01:42.320
Yeah.

01:42.320 --> 01:46.040
And we got quite an appropriate gift from the universe.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.840
Yes, as far as a four year, yeah.

01:48.840 --> 01:53.920
But it is nice to still be working on this with you and I appreciate that and so that

01:53.920 --> 01:54.920
is my bright spot.

01:54.920 --> 01:55.920
No, it's beautiful.

01:55.920 --> 02:00.040
It's one of those things where I have a hard time remembering that we didn't do this show.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.040
At some point.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.040
Yeah.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.040
Like there's a part of me that's like remembering-

02:03.040 --> 02:04.040
I did open mics.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.040
No, I remember.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.040
No, no, no.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.040
I was 24.

02:07.040 --> 02:12.560
I was in the fucking suburbs and I was doing an open mic my third of the night and I keep

02:12.560 --> 02:13.560
in my memory.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.680
I'm like, well tomorrow I'm going to have to record.

02:15.680 --> 02:18.440
Like that's how ridiculous it is that we do this show.

02:18.440 --> 02:21.840
The schedule has become something you've super imposed on.

02:21.840 --> 02:22.840
Retroactive.

02:22.840 --> 02:23.840
Yeah, yeah.

02:23.840 --> 02:24.840
Absolutely.

02:24.840 --> 02:25.840
What's your bright spot?

02:25.840 --> 02:27.640
My bright spot is I got new glasses.

02:27.640 --> 02:28.640
Nice.

02:28.640 --> 02:32.080
I got new glasses about two weeks after I got these.

02:32.080 --> 02:37.920
My dog Jake got a whole of them and there's tooth marks and the like all over.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.520
And that was about a year ago.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.320
So I went and got a new pair of glasses.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.400
And Dan, do you want to know how stupid I am?

02:44.400 --> 02:45.460
How stupid?

02:45.460 --> 02:48.680
When I went to get new glasses, I was looking at the frames and I was like, oh, you know

02:48.680 --> 02:49.680
what I'll do?

02:49.680 --> 02:50.680
I'll get some different frames.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.400
I like the same style, but I'm going to get some different frames.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.560
Can I predict what happened?

02:53.560 --> 02:57.040
I got the same exact frame, exact same frames.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.280
Intending to get the different ones.

02:58.280 --> 03:02.400
Intending to get different frames, I got the same one because I am predictable.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.400
That's pretty sweet.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.400
They look good though.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.400
Yeah, they look great.

03:05.400 --> 03:10.560
So something that doesn't look great is our prospects for going to bed at a decent hour.

03:10.560 --> 03:14.480
We're recording this a little bit late because necessity kind of had to.

03:14.480 --> 03:18.440
Yeah, you were, you know, some big news happened yesterday and you decided to sleep the whole

03:18.440 --> 03:19.440
day.

03:19.440 --> 03:20.920
You didn't pay any attention to it.

03:20.920 --> 03:24.120
You've really, like you did maybe two hours of work on this episode, right?

03:24.120 --> 03:25.120
Really phoned it in.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.480
Yeah, you threw this one on the, yeah.

03:27.480 --> 03:34.560
We were talking on Tuesday, we recorded our little bonus scavenger hunt over zoom and

03:34.560 --> 03:39.140
after we recorded that we were talking and I'm like, well, tomorrow's going to suck.

03:39.140 --> 03:40.840
It's going to be a disaster.

03:40.840 --> 03:45.720
I'm going to have to work a whole lot, so I'm going to do nothing today.

03:45.720 --> 03:50.120
I'm going to treat myself to a little bit of relaxation because I know that Wednesday

03:50.120 --> 03:51.600
is going to suck.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.040
I didn't think it was going to suck in the way that it did.

03:54.040 --> 03:58.920
Oh, at that point I was kind of predicting a dumb rally, but what I was thinking was

03:58.920 --> 04:04.640
going to suck was that Alex had interviewed Mike Flynn and I didn't want to deal with

04:04.640 --> 04:05.640
that.

04:05.640 --> 04:10.200
Oh man, how naive I was on Tuesday.

04:10.200 --> 04:14.560
I am the 10th famous person on the plane where the big bopper went down.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.080
Not going to be in the news anymore.

04:16.080 --> 04:17.080
Yeah, Mike Flynn's interview.

04:17.080 --> 04:19.080
You're going to have to be on the back burner.

04:19.080 --> 04:22.400
Yeah, page A-26 my friends.

04:22.400 --> 04:27.760
I did watch it and it's boring, but we may cover it at some point because it is a bizarre

04:27.760 --> 04:32.840
thing to happen because you have Mike Flynn who's like the hero of the QAnon folk who

04:32.840 --> 04:38.200
think Alex Jones is like a CIA massage shill and the two of them are doing an interview

04:38.200 --> 04:43.840
where they're like, Hey buddy, and they won't stop talking about it on the episode that

04:43.840 --> 04:45.400
we're going to be going over today.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.160
It ends with the two of them hugging.

04:47.160 --> 04:48.160
Oh, great.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.160
I love it.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.160
Great.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.400
Tom Pappert describes it as like a really important moment.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.400
Yeah.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.400
Yeah.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.400
Yeah.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.400
Of course.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.400
I don't know how QAnon fans would rationalize that.

04:57.400 --> 05:01.440
Like it seems like it'd be really difficult for their hero to be hugging a CIA facade

05:01.440 --> 05:02.440
agent.

05:02.440 --> 05:03.440
I know.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.440
Here's how I would do it.

05:04.440 --> 05:08.520
I would say he actually doesn't know anything about us, doesn't care and would just like

05:08.520 --> 05:09.520
our money.

05:09.520 --> 05:13.600
Ah, I mean that would be, that would be on the level.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.600
Yeah.

05:14.600 --> 05:19.920
So Jordan, today, what we're going to be doing, we're going to be going over, first of all,

05:19.920 --> 05:25.080
the speeches that Owen Troyer and Alex Jones gave at a Stop the Steal rally on the evening

05:25.080 --> 05:26.400
of January 5th.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.400
Okay.

05:27.400 --> 05:33.040
Then we will be tracking the entire day's coverage on Info Wars on January 6th.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.040
Okay.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.200
We're going to start with the American Journal call-in show.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.200
Call-in show.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.200
No calls.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.000
No calls.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Why not?

05:44.000 --> 05:46.440
Well, I mean, nothing had happened by then.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.160
No, I don't.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.360
That's early in the morning.

05:49.360 --> 05:54.560
It's mostly because Harrison Smith is hosting and he's just basically throwing it to...

05:54.560 --> 05:55.560
Just boring.

05:55.560 --> 05:57.880
Well, he's just throwing it to like Don Jr.'s speech and stuff like that.

05:57.880 --> 05:58.880
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.840
Then we've got the Alex Jones show, comes on after that.

06:01.840 --> 06:07.720
Also hosted by Harrison Smith, because Alex and Owen are in DC.

06:07.720 --> 06:13.860
And then we've got The War Room, which is hosted by Tom Papert and also Alex Jones and

06:13.860 --> 06:15.840
Owen Schroyer in DC.

06:15.840 --> 06:16.840
Okay.

06:16.840 --> 06:21.520
So, if I understand correctly, we are playing the Washington Generals today.

06:21.520 --> 06:22.840
Is that what's going on?

06:22.840 --> 06:25.720
It is the B string.

06:25.720 --> 06:26.720
But it's still important.

06:26.720 --> 06:31.760
I do still think it's important to look at the lens of how the coverage on Info Wars

06:31.760 --> 06:39.120
went because you can see Alex's hand, editorial control, you can see the training that these

06:39.120 --> 06:44.680
people have had under Alex, and Alex does show up a bit, and he's yelling.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.680
For sure, for sure.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.600
And it's a load of nonsense.

06:47.600 --> 06:53.920
But I apologize to everybody, I have been working straight through all day yesterday.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.300
I forgot to get names for Wonks.

06:56.300 --> 06:59.640
So I'll tell you what, before we start today's show, I'd like to say thank you to everybody

06:59.640 --> 07:05.100
who supports our show, and also everybody who likes the show but doesn't support it.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.100
I'd like to thank you.

07:06.100 --> 07:12.080
Anybody out there who needs this today, who needs a nice little pick-me-up, you're a policy

07:12.080 --> 07:13.080
Wonk.

07:13.080 --> 07:14.080
You know that?

07:14.080 --> 07:15.080
I'm a policy Wonk.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.080
Thank you.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.080
Thanks, everybody.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.080
Put a smile on your face.

07:18.080 --> 07:21.800
Thanks to all the Wonks, non-Wonks, and I guess people who are hearing this ten years

07:21.800 --> 07:22.800
in the future.

07:22.800 --> 07:23.800
Sure.

07:23.800 --> 07:24.800
Yeah.

07:24.800 --> 07:28.520
So yeah, on Wednesday, there was the planned rally in DC.

07:28.520 --> 07:29.520
We knew that there was-

07:29.520 --> 07:31.400
Went off without a hitch.

07:31.400 --> 07:38.360
I was not surprised, inasmuch as they've been talking about this for a long time, and Alex

07:38.360 --> 07:42.000
has been trying to incite an event like people storming the White House-

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Sure.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.380
Or not the White House, excuse me, the Capitol building, for quite a while.

07:45.380 --> 07:50.600
That has been something that has been a predictable conclusion from some-

07:50.600 --> 07:51.600
Sure.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.000
But I would be lying if I said I wasn't still, like, shocked.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Yeah.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.320
I wasn't ready for it to happen.

07:56.320 --> 07:57.320
Right.

07:57.320 --> 08:00.360
I was, I thought it was, like I said already, I thought it was gonna be another dumb rally

08:00.360 --> 08:05.400
where Ali Alexander says a bunch of nonsense, and then everyone goes home.

08:05.400 --> 08:10.460
I was taken aback by how quickly things got out of control, how extremely they got out

08:10.460 --> 08:17.960
of control, and I was pretty surprised watching Alex's coverage of it, too.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.560
Yeah, I'm interested to see.

08:20.560 --> 08:25.040
I was trying to avoid dipping my toe into how the conservative media would react too

08:25.040 --> 08:30.760
much to this, just so I didn't get a whiff of ruining the whole premise of the show,

08:30.760 --> 08:32.680
which is that I don't know what Alex is gonna say.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.680
Yeah.

08:33.680 --> 08:38.480
So I am very curious to see how they all take this as a glaring loss and that they're all

08:38.480 --> 08:40.200
a bunch of embarrassing morons.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.520
I think that's what they're gonna-

08:41.520 --> 08:47.780
I think this is interesting because you and I have very different takes on the events

08:47.780 --> 08:48.780
that transpired.

08:48.780 --> 08:49.960
Yes, very much.

08:49.960 --> 08:54.060
Over our text messages, we've been going back and forth, and there's a little bit of a disagreement,

08:54.060 --> 08:58.720
and I actually think that both of our positions have merit, and there's validity to both of

08:58.720 --> 08:59.720
them.

08:59.720 --> 09:05.520
You believe that this was an optics disaster, and they all looked like dum-dums, and this

09:05.520 --> 09:09.400
is going to be crippling to the right-wing extremist movement.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.880
Yeah, I would argue that.

09:10.880 --> 09:15.280
And I can see where you're coming from, and I think that there is a place for mocking,

09:15.280 --> 09:19.960
and I think that that is something that is valid to be part of the conversation.

09:19.960 --> 09:20.960
Sure, sure.

09:20.960 --> 09:25.760
Personally, I see Patriot lore being established, and that worries me.

09:25.760 --> 09:34.040
I see, you know, the way that Alex talks about Colonel Travis and his time at the Alamo,

09:34.040 --> 09:35.520
and it's like, this isn't history.

09:35.520 --> 09:36.520
Sure.

09:36.520 --> 09:37.520
This is Patriot lore.

09:37.520 --> 09:38.520
Sure, sure, sure.

09:38.520 --> 09:42.120
This is something like a misunderstanding and a misrepresentation of the past.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.120
Yeah.

09:43.120 --> 09:48.780
I see that happening in the present, and I see all of the elements that are necessary

09:48.780 --> 09:56.160
in this event to become a part of Patriot lore that is really encouraging and inspiring

09:56.160 --> 09:58.880
and dangerous for people in the future.

09:58.880 --> 09:59.880
Yeah.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.680
And I don't think that you don't think that's valid also.

10:01.680 --> 10:07.880
No, I think that's one of the weird things about our general disagreements is, I think

10:07.880 --> 10:13.600
you're probably right if a certain couple of variables, like, our worldviews are just

10:13.600 --> 10:17.680
like a couple little variables twisted here or there and we disagree.

10:17.680 --> 10:22.620
Otherwise, I think, even then, we're still coming at it from the same, like, this is

10:22.620 --> 10:24.640
where all of these people think.

10:24.640 --> 10:31.280
Yeah, and I think that some of these differences in our perspective, I hope they can be more

10:31.280 --> 10:35.160
fleshed out as we go along through the episode as we see the Infowars coverage.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.160
I think it's interesting.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.280
I think it's very interesting.

10:38.280 --> 10:43.520
Yeah, so we're going to jump in with the speeches at the Stop the Steal rally, but before we

10:43.520 --> 10:46.040
do, here's an out of context drop from today's show.

10:46.040 --> 10:52.760
God and his consciousness creates the ocean that creates the waves on which Donald Trump

10:52.760 --> 10:56.800
or an Alex Jones or you ride in on.

10:56.800 --> 10:57.800
Yep.

10:57.800 --> 11:03.960
So God creates the ocean, the ocean creates the waves, and Donald Trump, Alex Jones, and

11:03.960 --> 11:05.760
you ride them waves.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.760
Great.

11:06.760 --> 11:07.760
Okay.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.320
Alex might have been fucked up.

11:09.320 --> 11:13.120
He seems like he's gassed, like he's running out of breath.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.240
It's a mess.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.240
He's not...

11:15.240 --> 11:20.840
Oh God, it's another instance of him being the guy at the comedy show you never want

11:20.840 --> 11:21.840
to go after.

11:21.840 --> 11:22.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.640
You don't want this guy in the middle of the booking.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.640
Not where it's supposed to be.

11:25.640 --> 11:29.840
No, because he's going to burn out the audience with just...

11:29.840 --> 11:30.840
You can't do it.

11:30.840 --> 11:31.840
No.

11:31.840 --> 11:35.740
I mean, even if the guy in front of you is only doing 10 minutes and you're doing 45,

11:35.740 --> 11:38.440
if he gets eight standing ovations, you're done.

11:38.440 --> 11:39.440
Yeah.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.440
You're fucked.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.440
The end.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.440
Yeah.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.440
So we start with Owen though.

11:43.440 --> 11:44.440
Owen opens for Alex.

11:44.440 --> 11:45.440
He does a good...

11:45.440 --> 11:48.600
He does a tight five, let's say.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.740
But he starts off by ripping off Alex.

11:51.740 --> 11:56.120
President Trump is watching this and he's very excited at what he sees.

11:56.120 --> 12:06.080
And he's going to have some big announcements for us tomorrow, I believe.

12:06.080 --> 12:14.400
Thomas Jefferson once said, when the government fears the people, there is freedom.

12:14.400 --> 12:18.040
But for too long now, the people have feared the government.

12:18.040 --> 12:22.800
Well, in January, 2021, that changes.

12:22.800 --> 12:28.440
That looks a little worse in hindsight.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.480
We've been over this before, but that isn't a Thomas Jefferson quote.

12:31.480 --> 12:36.600
It's from a 1914 debate against socialism delivered by John Basil Barnhill that over

12:36.600 --> 12:41.280
the years has been misattributed to a bunch of people like Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.940
Perhaps more interestingly though, in that clip, it appears that Owen's trying to promote

12:44.940 --> 12:48.240
the idea that Trump is going to show up at the rally the next day.

12:48.240 --> 12:52.360
This was the first instance of an Infowars employee behaving in a way that led me to

12:52.360 --> 12:57.160
believe that they had no idea people were planning to storm the Capitol the next day.

12:57.160 --> 13:00.480
They are acting 100% business as usual.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.680
Promoting what they expect will just be another afternoon of profitable terrorism edging that

13:04.680 --> 13:05.680
they're going to be playing.

13:05.680 --> 13:07.960
And that's kind of the vibe that I get.

13:07.960 --> 13:14.160
And it's just, this is all like Infowars business as usual, just Owen being a dumb shithead.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.480
And the theme is four more years for Donald Trump.

13:17.480 --> 13:23.600
And while I all think, I think all of us can get behind that, I'd like to see a thousand

13:23.600 --> 13:31.480
more years of human freedom and a thousand more years of the United States of America.

13:31.480 --> 13:39.240
Then deal with climate change?

13:39.240 --> 13:40.240
USA!

13:40.240 --> 13:41.240
USA!

13:41.240 --> 13:42.240
USA!

13:42.240 --> 13:43.240
You dumb fuck!

13:43.240 --> 13:44.240
It always happens.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.240
Oh my God.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.240
They're so silly.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.240
It always happens.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.240
The USA chants break out so easily.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.840
Do you know, here's, here's the problem.

13:50.840 --> 13:51.840
Here's the problem with these.

13:51.840 --> 13:52.840
Oh.

13:52.840 --> 13:53.840
Here's the problem.

13:53.840 --> 13:54.840
I'm going to give you this right now.

13:54.840 --> 13:55.840
I'm surprised there's only one.

13:55.840 --> 13:56.920
There's only one that I can see.

13:56.920 --> 13:57.920
Okay.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.920
All right.

13:58.920 --> 13:59.920
Here's your audience.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.840
Look at those dumb dumbs.

14:01.840 --> 14:07.640
You can steal anything and they will have no, you stole a Thomas Jefferson quote from

14:07.640 --> 14:11.260
not Thomas Jefferson and they still bought it.

14:11.260 --> 14:16.960
Why wouldn't you go out there and be like, uh, uh, uh, would you rather have a Lexus

14:16.960 --> 14:17.960
or justice?

14:17.960 --> 14:21.080
A dream or some substance?

14:21.080 --> 14:22.080
Okay.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.520
Why wouldn't you go dead press?

14:23.520 --> 14:24.520
Why wouldn't you do something real?

14:24.520 --> 14:25.520
To quote Thomas Jefferson.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.520
Yeah, exactly.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.520
They schools don't teach us shit.

14:28.520 --> 14:36.400
Yeah, just stay awake or try and get really fancy and just completely lie to the audience

14:36.400 --> 14:39.240
is just like grapes don't exist.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.640
Yeah.

14:40.640 --> 14:41.960
Let's fucking shoot the moon.

14:41.960 --> 14:42.960
Yeah.

14:42.960 --> 14:43.960
Yeah.

14:43.960 --> 14:44.960
What's it?

14:44.960 --> 14:45.960
Where's our line?

14:45.960 --> 14:46.960
What's the line?

14:46.960 --> 14:48.920
I think that, uh, the fake Thomas Jefferson quotes are just something that's so in the

14:48.920 --> 14:51.480
pocket for them that it's safe territory.

14:51.480 --> 14:52.480
You can't go wrong.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.480
No.

14:53.480 --> 14:54.480
No.

14:54.480 --> 14:57.560
Um, also I would say that even under like ideal conditions, I don't know if America

14:57.560 --> 14:59.360
could last another thousand years.

14:59.360 --> 15:06.480
Climate change notwithstanding, that's still a long time for a country to, uh, I guess

15:06.480 --> 15:11.040
maybe, but you know, it could still exist in some fashion, but not like super power.

15:11.040 --> 15:16.700
I mean, it'll probably be more like the homie Holy Roman empire was in Germany for a while.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.000
You know, like that kind of thing.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.060
It would, it would be a bizarre to imagine continuing at the, the re like the status

15:23.060 --> 15:24.060
thing.

15:24.060 --> 15:25.060
Yeah.

15:25.060 --> 15:26.060
Yeah.

15:26.060 --> 15:27.060
It's for that long.

15:27.060 --> 15:30.160
Small parts of Montana that cut apart.

15:30.160 --> 15:37.300
It's foolish on Owen's part, but I will say, I think that Owen feels the itch to get into

15:37.300 --> 15:39.680
a line of work that you and I used to explore.

15:39.680 --> 15:40.680
Okay.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.180
I think he wants to start doing open mics.

15:42.180 --> 15:43.180
You think he wants to do a little bits?

15:43.180 --> 15:47.640
Well, you remember when, uh, he took the tank down to the Austin, uh, they're getting ready

15:47.640 --> 15:52.660
to go on the, uh, the caravan and he was workshopping bits to empty traffic.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.660
He was doing jokes.

15:53.660 --> 15:54.660
Sure.

15:54.660 --> 15:55.660
Sure.

15:55.660 --> 15:56.660
He's got a new bit.

15:56.660 --> 15:57.660
Yeah.

15:57.660 --> 16:04.500
But you know, Nancy Pelosi said that you can no longer say mother and father in Congress.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.500
Did you see this?

16:05.500 --> 16:09.700
Well, I got news for Nancy Pelosi.

16:09.700 --> 16:11.700
Trump is your daddy.

16:11.700 --> 16:21.660
Good bit, good bit solid, solid piece of work right there or doing the, you can't say mother

16:21.660 --> 16:29.980
and father 24 hours prior to the fall of the United States government, a nuclear power.

16:29.980 --> 16:34.460
One of the leaders of the resistance said Trump is your daddy.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.460
Great.

16:35.460 --> 16:38.340
Uh, five years ago they did this.

16:38.340 --> 16:41.380
You can't say mother and father paranoia and panic.

16:41.380 --> 16:44.100
It's great to see them bringing back the hits about time.

16:44.100 --> 16:49.340
So this is in response to Nancy Pelosi, uh, and, uh, the, the house updating their rule

16:49.340 --> 16:50.340
book.

16:50.340 --> 16:51.340
Sure.

16:51.340 --> 16:55.740
The text of the rule book doesn't include gendered language, but that doesn't mean that

16:55.740 --> 16:57.940
you can't say mother and father.

16:57.940 --> 16:59.320
That's not like it's against the rules.

16:59.320 --> 17:02.100
It's just not in the text of the rules.

17:02.100 --> 17:05.660
This is like Skinner, you know, they've been doing new stuff for five years, but whenever

17:05.660 --> 17:08.340
you go in public, you still got to play the hits.

17:08.340 --> 17:09.340
But you know, yeah.

17:09.340 --> 17:15.240
But this would be like, you know, you don't play free bird for a few years and then you

17:15.240 --> 17:17.740
bring it out as if it has never been played before.

17:17.740 --> 17:19.540
They've just been on the radio too much.

17:19.540 --> 17:20.540
They haven't been in public.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.140
They haven't really had that chance to get a free bird out there.

17:23.140 --> 17:24.140
You know?

17:24.140 --> 17:30.440
Um, I would say that a free bird is a long song and Owen Schroyer set is not long.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.440
That's a smart move.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.780
Um, this is no stairway to heaven.

17:33.780 --> 17:35.580
This is a, uh, in and out.

17:35.580 --> 17:36.580
Okay.

17:36.580 --> 17:37.580
All right.

17:37.580 --> 17:39.580
Uh, two and a half minute pop song.

17:39.580 --> 17:43.660
He's getting out of there and he's a, he's a, also another standup reference.

17:43.660 --> 17:45.400
It's a shotgun situation.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.660
He's introducing Alex.

17:46.660 --> 17:47.660
All right.

17:47.660 --> 17:48.660
That's good stuff.

17:48.660 --> 17:49.660
Coming up next.

17:49.660 --> 17:54.020
It's my pleasure to introduce a man.

17:54.020 --> 18:01.540
It's my honor to introduce a man who was the Genesis in many ways of this second American

18:01.540 --> 18:02.540
revolution.

18:02.540 --> 18:12.620
Dear FBI, Alex Jones was in many ways the Genesis of this that started with one man

18:12.620 --> 18:18.660
on public access television will tomorrow turn into millions of Americans in the streets

18:18.660 --> 18:32.140
of Washington DC to take our Republic back and that man's name is really also does not

18:32.140 --> 18:33.140
look great.

18:33.140 --> 18:34.140
Oh man.

18:34.140 --> 18:37.020
Oh, I want that on my wall.

18:37.020 --> 18:42.020
Only one man on public access in Austin, Texas is responsible for everything that happens

18:42.020 --> 18:43.020
tomorrow.

18:43.020 --> 18:49.020
I just want any law enforcement entities that may be recording this speech.

18:49.020 --> 18:54.180
As we speak to know this is all on Alex Jones.

18:54.180 --> 18:59.300
Tomorrow will be the culmination of his professional career.

18:59.300 --> 19:05.540
I'm just saying you want to stop this movement, get Alex Jones.

19:05.540 --> 19:06.940
It's all on him.

19:06.940 --> 19:07.940
It's only him.

19:07.940 --> 19:12.140
I'm throwing him under the bus by way of flattery.

19:12.140 --> 19:16.900
This is the greatest man who is responsible for everything.

19:16.900 --> 19:21.820
I found myself feeling a lot of that like in hindsight.

19:21.820 --> 19:22.820
This is terrible.

19:22.820 --> 19:27.020
But then the other thing that I was feeling was that like there's a lot of stand up shit

19:27.020 --> 19:35.260
in here like Owens doing some stand up getting the crowd to chant USA is pandery nonsense

19:35.260 --> 19:38.920
and Alex basically starts his set with like give it up for yourselves.

19:38.920 --> 19:42.460
He does like a give it up for the wait staff out of here.

19:42.460 --> 19:46.500
I'll tell you who I'm excited to hear to see.

19:46.500 --> 19:53.940
It's you, the American people, unified in resistance to the new world order.

19:53.940 --> 19:56.220
Give yourselves a round of applause for coming out tonight.

19:56.220 --> 19:57.220
Yeah.

19:57.220 --> 19:58.220
Jesus.

19:58.220 --> 19:59.220
What a lovely audience.

19:59.220 --> 20:00.220
You guys are the best.

20:00.220 --> 20:01.220
All right.

20:01.220 --> 20:02.220
Okay.

20:02.220 --> 20:04.540
If I'm, if I'm doing my set, I want to open with three applause breaks.

20:04.540 --> 20:05.540
Doesn't matter.

20:05.540 --> 20:07.180
I want to say, give it up for your wait staff.

20:07.180 --> 20:09.700
Hey, give it up for yourselves for coming out tonight.

20:09.700 --> 20:15.740
Hey, ladies and gentlemen, how about those sports teams like them or a nice gracious

20:15.740 --> 20:18.740
move if maybe you're the headliner, give it up for everyone else who saw tonight.

20:18.740 --> 20:19.740
Totally.

20:19.740 --> 20:20.740
Absolutely.

20:20.740 --> 20:21.740
That's super cool.

20:21.740 --> 20:23.620
That number three in there and then get your set going.

20:23.620 --> 20:24.620
Oh yes.

20:24.620 --> 20:28.580
Um, so Alex at least has maybe learned that as a little bit of etiquette.

20:28.580 --> 20:29.580
Sure.

20:29.580 --> 20:32.400
Which I haven't seen in some of his other speeches, so I think that might be a performance

20:32.400 --> 20:33.400
evolution on his part.

20:33.400 --> 20:38.300
I mean, so many failed right wing comics are these people, so I assume Alex has spent a

20:38.300 --> 20:41.100
lot more time with failed right wing comics recently.

20:41.100 --> 20:42.100
It's possible.

20:42.100 --> 20:45.860
And maybe he's going backwards, maybe he's Benjamin buttoning it.

20:45.860 --> 20:52.420
Now he's going from right wing reactionary to successful comic, that would be the worst

20:52.420 --> 20:53.420
part.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.420
If he suddenly nails it.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.420
I've seen him do stand up.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.420
Okay.

20:56.420 --> 20:57.420
Well, we have to.

20:57.420 --> 21:03.980
Um, but he does have a head start on other, let's say younger comics coming up.

21:03.980 --> 21:04.980
Sure.

21:04.980 --> 21:05.980
And that name recognition.

21:05.980 --> 21:06.980
Well, there's that.

21:06.980 --> 21:07.980
Yeah.

21:07.980 --> 21:12.380
But he's also got a catch phrase and he's got a catch phrase that apparently audiences

21:12.380 --> 21:13.620
will chant with him.

21:13.620 --> 21:14.620
Get the fuck.

21:14.620 --> 21:18.620
They have tried to steal this election in front of everyone.

21:18.620 --> 21:24.620
And as I told them 20 years ago, I tell them again, I don't know how this is going to end,

21:24.620 --> 21:30.900
but if they want to fight, they better believe.

21:30.900 --> 21:32.180
He's got his own get her done.

21:32.180 --> 21:34.060
People will call and response that shit.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.060
Yeah.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.060
Get the fuck out.

21:36.060 --> 21:37.060
Yeah.

21:37.060 --> 21:38.060
That was wild.

21:38.060 --> 21:39.060
I have never heard that before in my life.

21:39.060 --> 21:40.060
Oh, he yells that all the time.

21:40.060 --> 21:41.060
Yeah.

21:41.060 --> 21:43.560
But I mean, if you, if you think, uh, you know, if you want to fight, you better believe

21:43.560 --> 21:44.560
you got one.

21:44.560 --> 21:45.560
That right.

21:45.560 --> 21:46.560
Yeah.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.620
But I mean like that was a long thing for people to remember.

21:48.620 --> 21:50.620
Yeah.

21:50.620 --> 21:51.620
It shocked me.

21:51.620 --> 21:54.780
It's a little, it's a little, the length of the Lord's prayer.

21:54.780 --> 21:57.380
I'm just saying, I don't remember all of the Lord's prayer.

21:57.380 --> 22:00.300
If I was up after this, I would be worried.

22:00.300 --> 22:04.780
I would start with the Lord's prayer to bring the energy down again.

22:04.780 --> 22:09.060
I would be super worried because it's like, all right, either he's going to fuck this

22:09.060 --> 22:14.220
up or I'm not going to be able to follow one of the two.

22:14.220 --> 22:15.220
Yeah.

22:15.220 --> 22:17.420
Anyway, he almost alienates the audience.

22:17.420 --> 22:21.420
Alex Jones is the Lauren Hill of the right.

22:21.420 --> 22:27.980
He all, he almost immediately after this, after getting a getter done style champs,

22:27.980 --> 22:32.380
he almost alienates the audience by accidentally saying that Hitler was bad.

22:32.380 --> 22:36.020
Hitler was a monster.

22:36.020 --> 22:45.620
Stalin was a monster, but what Mao Zedong and Xi Jinping did overshadows their crimes

22:45.620 --> 22:50.540
against us, against humanity.

22:50.540 --> 23:00.540
They commit against a Muslim, a Christian, a Buddhist, an agnostian, a Chinese, an African,

23:00.540 --> 23:01.540
a North American.

23:01.540 --> 23:03.540
It doesn't matter.

23:03.540 --> 23:04.540
I think he's fucked up.

23:04.540 --> 23:08.040
It's a crime in the eyes of God.

23:08.040 --> 23:11.780
You can tell that Alex is a serious scholar of Chinese history and the Chinese Communist

23:11.780 --> 23:14.780
Party because he knows the names of Mao and Xi.

23:14.780 --> 23:19.880
I actually kind of think that he doesn't realize that Xi isn't Mao's successor and I'd love

23:19.880 --> 23:24.980
to bring up Hu Jintao to him because then he would say who and then we'd end up in a

23:24.980 --> 23:25.980
vaudeville bit.

23:25.980 --> 23:32.160
I would, I would legitimately like to ask him if he knows that Chairman Mao had a wife.

23:32.160 --> 23:37.140
I would be interested to know if he thinks that the whole time it was just him.

23:37.140 --> 23:38.140
I don't know.

23:38.140 --> 23:39.140
You know?

23:39.140 --> 23:40.540
I don't think he knows a whole lot more than a couple of names.

23:40.540 --> 23:41.660
I think that you might be right.

23:41.660 --> 23:44.260
Some broad strokes and maybe something he read in a JBS pamphlet.

23:44.260 --> 23:45.260
Could be.

23:45.260 --> 23:49.140
Leaving that aside, it's important to understand that Alex is lying to this audience in a very,

23:49.140 --> 23:50.760
very real way.

23:50.760 --> 23:55.240
He doesn't care at all what China does to the Uyghur population of Muslims except when

23:55.240 --> 23:58.840
he can use their pain as a weapon against his own enemies.

23:58.840 --> 24:02.220
In this case, he's in front of a crowd so he wants to establish the moral high ground

24:02.220 --> 24:06.340
against their imaginary evil enemies who support China's treatment of Muslims.

24:06.340 --> 24:10.780
When he's alone on his own show speaking freely, he sounds a little bit different like he did

24:10.780 --> 24:12.820
on May 26th.

24:12.820 --> 24:20.580
But from Michigan to Texas, from London to Los Angeles, from Rio de Janeiro to Berlin,

24:20.580 --> 24:21.580
there are call to prayers.

24:21.580 --> 24:26.100
I don't like to call it as Chinese but they don't put up with that because they know it's

24:26.100 --> 24:28.180
a group trying to take them over.

24:28.180 --> 24:30.440
Hey, Chai-Coms, do your thing.

24:30.440 --> 24:31.660
Don't try to take me over.

24:31.660 --> 24:32.660
Do your thing.

24:32.660 --> 24:33.660
Do your thing, Chai-Coms.

24:33.660 --> 24:34.660
Come on, man.

24:34.660 --> 24:37.420
Talking about their repressive treatment to certain Muslim populations.

24:37.420 --> 24:38.420
No, he cares.

24:38.420 --> 24:39.420
Do your thing.

24:39.420 --> 24:40.420
No, he cares.

24:40.420 --> 24:41.420
He cares.

24:41.420 --> 24:42.420
Well, when it's useful.

24:42.420 --> 24:43.420
I mean, yeah.

24:43.420 --> 24:47.140
What Alex is doing here on stage is exactly what he and his friends accuse the entire

24:47.140 --> 24:50.180
left of doing, virtue signaling.

24:50.180 --> 24:54.940
Alex doesn't care about how China treats Muslims because if Alex had his way, the only Muslims

24:54.940 --> 24:58.220
that would be allowed in America would be the ones who agreed to convert to his bizarre

24:58.220 --> 25:00.780
idiotic version of Christianity.

25:00.780 --> 25:04.700
Quite simply, Alex is using the false impression that he's offended by how the Chinese government

25:04.700 --> 25:09.020
treats the Uyghurs in order to pretend that his criticisms of China come from a sensible

25:09.020 --> 25:15.260
and real place, when in reality, they're mostly just re-warmed up, John Birch society, Cold

25:15.260 --> 25:16.260
War nonsense.

25:16.260 --> 25:17.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:17.260 --> 25:18.260
Yep.

25:18.260 --> 25:21.740
It's a bummer, but also Alex does seem a little bit fucked up.

25:21.740 --> 25:23.740
He seems a little messed up.

25:23.740 --> 25:25.340
He's having a good time.

25:25.340 --> 25:26.340
Yes.

25:26.340 --> 25:27.340
I agree.

25:27.340 --> 25:32.680
There are currently, I would say, on the countdown of ways to learn, we've gone from ten to about

25:32.680 --> 25:33.680
eight.

25:33.680 --> 25:34.680
Jordan.

25:34.680 --> 25:35.980
When he gets down to a four, we know we're fucked up.

25:35.980 --> 25:37.380
Right now, there are eight ways to learn.

25:37.380 --> 25:42.220
I would say that he's having a good time, and more importantly, he has had a good time

25:42.220 --> 25:43.780
before this.

25:43.780 --> 25:44.780
That's fair.

25:44.780 --> 25:45.780
He's been having a good time.

25:45.780 --> 25:46.780
That's a fair characterization.

25:46.780 --> 25:49.180
And I think, like I was saying, he's gassed.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.760
He has no cardio.

25:50.760 --> 25:55.900
If you're a comic and you want to be a high-energy comic, you'll quickly learn that if you're

25:55.900 --> 25:59.100
out of shape, you're going to have a really tough time with that.

25:59.100 --> 26:02.140
You see comics who are maybe a little bit more energetic.

26:02.140 --> 26:06.180
Sometimes they'll be sweating, and it's because it's hard.

26:06.180 --> 26:08.060
It's hard to keep that energy up.

26:08.060 --> 26:09.060
Oh yeah.

26:09.060 --> 26:10.060
And I think Alex is learning.

26:10.060 --> 26:11.060
I'm sweating now.

26:11.060 --> 26:12.300
We're only a half hour in.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.300
Alex is learning this the hard way.

26:14.300 --> 26:20.300
And just as authoritarians throughout history have bet on the Bolsheviks, and bet on the

26:20.300 --> 26:28.340
Nazis, and bet on every other form of tyranny, their bet will fail.

26:28.340 --> 26:31.860
I guess you're right.

26:31.860 --> 26:38.580
Because there is a God that created the universe, and there is a God that inspired our republic,

26:38.580 --> 26:46.860
and there is a God in the control of the affairs of humans, and that God will see us through

26:46.860 --> 26:50.660
if we are loyal.

26:50.660 --> 26:55.480
I don't know if it came through as well on the audio, but you can tell he's getting his

26:55.480 --> 26:58.580
breath after just about every other word.

26:58.580 --> 27:02.640
And it doesn't look comfortable.

27:02.640 --> 27:08.420
But he also gets into safe territory to start this getting into religion.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.680
Get into God.

27:09.680 --> 27:11.060
Get in or get out.

27:11.060 --> 27:12.060
Yeah.

27:12.060 --> 27:15.420
And once you start talking about religion, it's important that you level with the audience.

27:15.420 --> 27:16.420
You gotta be real.

27:16.420 --> 27:17.420
Sure.

27:17.420 --> 27:18.420
You gotta be real.

27:18.420 --> 27:19.420
Let's hear this one.

27:19.420 --> 27:20.420
But make no mistake.

27:20.420 --> 27:21.740
Make no mistake.

27:21.740 --> 27:25.860
I'm like being completely honest with you here.

27:25.860 --> 27:26.860
Things are gonna be rough.

27:26.860 --> 27:27.860
I'm drunk.

27:27.860 --> 27:28.860
I'm in bed.

27:28.860 --> 27:29.860
I'm kind of shitfaced.

27:29.860 --> 27:32.660
We've already allowed the murder of 60 million babies in this country.

27:32.660 --> 27:33.660
I took a lot out of it.

27:33.660 --> 27:35.300
We've done so many other evil things.

27:35.300 --> 27:37.300
So we're deep down in the water.

27:37.300 --> 27:38.900
We're hundreds of feet deep.

27:38.900 --> 27:41.500
It's gonna be hard swimming back to the surface.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.960
And not everybody is gonna make it.

27:43.960 --> 27:45.500
But that's okay.

27:45.500 --> 27:55.340
Because in the end, God will fulfill his destiny and will reward the righteous.

27:55.340 --> 27:59.740
Outside of some surface level stuff, this is exactly the kind of speech I would expect

27:59.740 --> 28:01.480
to hear at an ISIS rally.

28:01.480 --> 28:06.420
You know, there'd be some different decoration and some different themes maybe, but this

28:06.420 --> 28:07.420
is...

28:07.420 --> 28:08.420
Totally.

28:08.420 --> 28:09.420
This is culty.

28:09.420 --> 28:11.780
Yeah, these guys are ISIS.

28:11.780 --> 28:12.980
It's really messed up.

28:12.980 --> 28:20.940
I am so happy to remember how many times people told me years ago, don't call them ISIS.

28:20.940 --> 28:22.140
That's offensive.

28:22.140 --> 28:23.140
That's too much.

28:23.140 --> 28:24.140
Mwah!

28:24.140 --> 28:25.140
They're ISIS.

28:25.140 --> 28:26.140
They're ISIS.

28:26.140 --> 28:27.140
Love it.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.140
Love it.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.140
I...

28:29.140 --> 28:30.140
Fuck you, the past.

28:30.140 --> 28:35.140
Well, I mean, it's possible for you to have been onto something and also wrong them.

28:35.140 --> 28:36.940
I am aware.

28:36.940 --> 28:37.940
I am aware.

28:37.940 --> 28:40.180
Uh, but maybe not now.

28:40.180 --> 28:47.300
Just as we see in the Bible and just as we see in history, God rises up men who are real.

28:47.300 --> 28:53.780
Not men that are perfect, not men that are above reproach, but real men like President

28:53.780 --> 28:54.780
Trump.

28:54.780 --> 28:59.340
Who has fought hard for our Republic.

28:59.340 --> 29:01.660
Who's fought hard for justice.

29:01.660 --> 29:10.140
Who's done the best job he can and because he has represented us, he is under attack.

29:10.140 --> 29:20.660
So we hold up President Trump before the creator of the universe and we say thank you for trying

29:20.660 --> 29:27.300
to send us a deliverer, though he's not perfect as we are, but we pray for him and we pray

29:27.300 --> 29:31.300
for America and we hold him up in this hour of peril.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.860
Sounds like his voice is about to bottom out, too, like...

29:33.860 --> 29:37.100
Give up the gasoline, road warrior.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.100
Wow.

29:38.100 --> 29:39.100
Thank you.

29:39.100 --> 29:40.100
All right.

29:40.100 --> 29:41.100
Okay.

29:41.100 --> 29:46.780
Thank you, God, for sending Trump as a deliverer.

29:46.780 --> 29:48.940
Oh boy.

29:48.940 --> 29:55.300
It's funny to hear that speech broadcast on TV and know it.

29:55.300 --> 29:58.380
I'm not positive that this speech was broadcast on TV.

29:58.380 --> 29:59.380
Oh, that's fair.

29:59.380 --> 30:00.380
That's fair.

30:00.380 --> 30:05.220
I meant in a more ethereal sense of it, traveling throughout space.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.220
It's sent to a satellite.

30:06.220 --> 30:07.220
Sure.

30:07.220 --> 30:08.620
It's on the right side broadcast network.

30:08.620 --> 30:15.100
To space and then sent back down, sent around everywhere, all of this happening instantly.

30:15.100 --> 30:21.020
In his pocket is a small little brick with all of human history recorded inside of it.

30:21.020 --> 30:25.340
And he's like, we've got Trump as our deliverer because of God.

30:25.340 --> 30:26.340
It's super weird.

30:26.340 --> 30:27.340
What world do we live in?

30:27.340 --> 30:31.380
It's super weird, too, to imagine that signal going into people's homes and then at least

30:31.380 --> 30:33.660
one person is watching it like, damn right.

30:33.660 --> 30:34.660
Yeah.

30:34.660 --> 30:35.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:35.660 --> 30:36.660
That's very bizarre to me.

30:36.660 --> 30:37.660
Like, seeing this...

30:37.660 --> 30:39.140
You realize a miracle's in your face.

30:39.140 --> 30:44.180
Well, I mean, seeing this speech, it's like, yeah, yeah.

30:44.180 --> 30:45.660
I get what Alex is doing.

30:45.660 --> 30:49.500
Like, I kind of understand what he's up to.

30:49.500 --> 30:53.100
It's baffling to me to imagine that, you know, people are like...

30:53.100 --> 30:54.100
Wild.

30:54.100 --> 30:55.100
Yeah, this is good.

30:55.100 --> 30:56.100
Yeah, man.

30:56.100 --> 30:57.100
This is...

30:57.100 --> 30:58.100
Totally.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.100
This is entertainment.

30:59.100 --> 31:00.100
Absolutely.

31:00.100 --> 31:01.100
Or like, this is inspiring.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.100
You know who my favorite character...

31:02.100 --> 31:03.100
Fucked up.

31:03.100 --> 31:04.100
...in Fury Road was?

31:04.100 --> 31:05.100
Immortan Joe.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.580
I thought he was the guy I wanted to follow.

31:06.580 --> 31:08.500
Ride or die, Immortan Joe.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.020
Well, it could not be worse than Bill Gates.

31:11.020 --> 31:12.020
Okay.

31:12.020 --> 31:13.020
I know that.

31:13.020 --> 31:14.020
Okay.

31:14.020 --> 31:15.020
Yeah.

31:15.020 --> 31:16.020
I was looking around on band.video.

31:16.020 --> 31:17.020
Okay.

31:17.020 --> 31:23.020
And there's a new section on there, and it's just titled, Bill Gates is Evil.

31:23.020 --> 31:24.020
I guess...

31:24.020 --> 31:26.020
That's also a folder I have on my desktop, but yeah, yeah.

31:26.020 --> 31:30.140
I guess that's what Alex is doing instead of making that documentary about Bill Gates.

31:30.140 --> 31:33.180
He's just got a place where he's posted some shitty videos about him.

31:33.180 --> 31:34.180
That's nice.

31:34.180 --> 31:35.180
Organize it.

31:35.180 --> 31:36.180
Yeah.

31:36.180 --> 31:37.180
But he doesn't run the world, that Bill Gates.

31:37.180 --> 31:41.180
What is God in control of human destiny?

31:41.180 --> 31:49.740
Not Bill Gates, not Warren Buffet, not Lord Rothschild, not the globalist.

31:49.740 --> 32:01.500
And it's that simple understanding that God of the universe is in control, not the globalist

32:01.500 --> 32:03.220
who want to play God.

32:03.220 --> 32:12.140
We recognize God, we connect with God, and we transcend the Satanist by doing that.

32:12.140 --> 32:16.460
I think people were worried about when that sentence was gonna end.

32:16.460 --> 32:17.460
Yeah.

32:17.460 --> 32:18.460
Yeah, that one kept going.

32:18.460 --> 32:19.460
That one kept going.

32:19.460 --> 32:20.460
I think Alex didn't.

32:20.460 --> 32:21.940
He was trying to find his feet.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.540
I don't mind a run-on sentence.

32:23.540 --> 32:26.180
I don't mind one, but there are times when you shouldn't.

32:26.180 --> 32:27.180
Yeah.

32:27.180 --> 32:32.140
It felt like the sentence was as drunk as Alex appears to be, just sort of staggering

32:32.140 --> 32:33.140
forward.

32:33.140 --> 32:36.700
There you go.

32:36.700 --> 32:41.940
So this next thing that Alex says also doesn't look great in hindsight.

32:41.940 --> 32:44.960
Tomorrow is a great day.

32:44.960 --> 32:50.500
We don't quietly take the election fraud, we don't quietly take the scam and believe

32:50.500 --> 32:51.500
they're BS.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.940
We've seen the evidence.

32:53.940 --> 33:02.500
The system has had to desperately engage in this gambit to maintain control, but this

33:02.500 --> 33:05.300
will be their Waterloo.

33:05.300 --> 33:08.380
This will be their destruction.

33:08.380 --> 33:11.940
Doesn't look great.

33:11.940 --> 33:16.380
I would say that if I were Alex and I were confronted with that, I would be like, I wasn't

33:16.380 --> 33:17.700
talking about Waterloo, the battle.

33:17.700 --> 33:18.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:18.700 --> 33:19.860
I was talking about the ABBA song.

33:19.860 --> 33:22.460
This is all political.

33:22.460 --> 33:23.460
Political only.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.940
I am not talking about literal events.

33:25.940 --> 33:27.140
Yeah, that would be smart.

33:27.140 --> 33:28.740
Depicting war.

33:28.740 --> 33:32.260
So now here was my concern when I was talking about being the person who comes up after

33:32.260 --> 33:35.000
him is like, he's going to lose the crowd.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.740
This is like, you can't keep this up.

33:36.740 --> 33:40.700
This is like, he's going to, he's burning up, coming in hot and he's going to burn out

33:40.700 --> 33:41.700
fast.

33:41.700 --> 33:44.620
And Ornie Adams up next, wait, what?

33:44.620 --> 33:50.020
Alex starts dipping his toes into COVID denial and he starts losing the audience a little

33:50.020 --> 33:51.020
bit.

33:51.020 --> 33:52.020
They're like, ah, we're just not here.

33:52.020 --> 33:53.020
Come on, man.

33:53.020 --> 33:54.020
This is about this.

33:54.020 --> 33:55.020
Cool.

33:55.020 --> 33:56.020
But we're not here for this.

33:56.020 --> 33:58.100
This is a stop the steal rally.

33:58.100 --> 34:05.260
And the world is watching every thing you do with the big tech censorship and the economic

34:05.260 --> 34:12.820
attacks and the COVID lockdowns and the UN martial law world government foretold for

34:12.820 --> 34:23.100
thousands of years is now upon us and it's pathetic and it will be defeated.

34:23.100 --> 34:30.900
We finally face the world government chicken little witch hunt system and we have the deaths

34:30.900 --> 34:43.220
of 2020 from the CDC 61,000 more people died in 2020 and when you count, when you count

34:43.220 --> 34:59.460
the drug addiction, the drug overdose and suicide, less people died in 2020, 2019 is

34:59.460 --> 35:00.460
broken.

35:00.460 --> 35:01.460
That wasn't me.

35:01.460 --> 35:06.300
Have to go out and you have to expose it.

35:06.300 --> 35:07.620
It's fallen apart a little bit.

35:07.620 --> 35:08.620
Yeah.

35:08.620 --> 35:09.620
I think you should have left that one alone.

35:09.620 --> 35:10.620
Yeah.

35:10.620 --> 35:11.620
The wheels are off the wagon.

35:11.620 --> 35:12.620
I was just making up numbers.

35:12.620 --> 35:13.620
Alex is a little bit drunk now.

35:13.620 --> 35:15.700
Alex is a little bit too drunk to stay on target.

35:15.700 --> 35:18.500
I think he's just, you know, it got good to him.

35:18.500 --> 35:23.140
He was feeling like sometimes you'll be on stage, like your first three bits will land

35:23.140 --> 35:25.140
and you're like, I'm going to try out something new.

35:25.140 --> 35:28.220
I'm just, nope, I fucked up.

35:28.220 --> 35:34.420
No, I think he's in a, I think he's in a nice little world of like, hold on, I'm going to

35:34.420 --> 35:35.420
do one more bit.

35:35.420 --> 35:38.420
That last one didn't land, so I'm going to do one more bit and then that one lands and

35:38.420 --> 35:41.220
you're like, oh shit, I'm going to do one more after that.

35:41.220 --> 35:42.220
I'm going to push it.

35:42.220 --> 35:43.900
I'm going to keep letting this ride.

35:43.900 --> 35:46.140
No one's going to get this, but he's Mike Sheehan again.

35:46.140 --> 35:47.140
Yeah, exactly.

35:47.140 --> 35:48.140
Yeah.

35:48.140 --> 35:50.340
Um, yeah, I would say that's about right.

35:50.340 --> 35:56.060
Um, so when you, when you're in that circumstance, the only thing you can do is retreat back

35:56.060 --> 35:57.620
to what was working.

35:57.620 --> 35:58.620
Yeah.

35:58.620 --> 36:00.580
Try and be like, okay, I was being dirty earlier.

36:00.580 --> 36:04.820
I tried to be like more introspective and observational.

36:04.820 --> 36:05.820
They didn't like that.

36:05.820 --> 36:07.180
Gotta go back to dick jokes.

36:07.180 --> 36:08.340
Don't be mean to Hitler.

36:08.340 --> 36:10.980
I realized that if you're mean to Hitler, it's bad.

36:10.980 --> 36:11.980
Yeah.

36:11.980 --> 36:12.980
Yeah.

36:12.980 --> 36:13.980
Popping the crowd.

36:13.980 --> 36:14.980
Let's go back to religion.

36:14.980 --> 36:22.060
So we must now pray for president Trump and lift him up to God and ask God to give him

36:22.060 --> 36:30.060
the guidance and the discernment and the leadership to make the decisions in God's plan that bring

36:30.060 --> 36:34.220
down the new world order.

36:34.220 --> 36:35.220
Got him back a little bit.

36:35.220 --> 36:36.220
All right.

36:36.220 --> 36:37.220
Yeah.

36:37.220 --> 36:38.220
All right.

36:38.220 --> 36:39.220
Back on his side a bit.

36:39.220 --> 36:40.220
It should be harder than that.

36:40.220 --> 36:41.220
These people are not very smart.

36:41.220 --> 36:45.380
They believe things like that, like that fake Jefferson quote earlier, and now Alex pulls

36:45.380 --> 36:47.900
out a fake Churchill quote.

36:47.900 --> 36:54.660
Churchill gave up a famous speech where he said, all I can promise you was blood and

36:54.660 --> 37:05.700
pain and war and suffering, but the alternative is even worse, total slavery.

37:05.700 --> 37:09.820
So we don't care what the new world order does.

37:09.820 --> 37:20.860
We commit to Christ and we commit to war against the globalist with the truth and we will never

37:20.860 --> 37:21.860
surrender.

37:21.860 --> 37:27.660
I may be wrong and I'm open to admitting that if Alex will go ahead and provide that citation,

37:27.660 --> 37:31.060
but I think the quote he's trying to remember is from Churchill's first speech as prime

37:31.060 --> 37:33.880
minister in the House of Commons in 1940.

37:33.880 --> 37:38.620
The part Alex I think is misquoting is, quote, in this crisis I hope I may be pardoned if

37:38.620 --> 37:41.140
I do not address the House at any length today.

37:41.140 --> 37:44.880
I hope that any of my friends and colleagues or former colleagues who are affected by the

37:44.880 --> 37:49.520
political reconstruction will make allowance, all allowance, for any lack of ceremony with

37:49.520 --> 37:51.660
which it has been necessary to act.

37:51.660 --> 37:55.900
I would say to the House, as I say to those who have joined this government, I have nothing

37:55.900 --> 37:59.220
to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.

37:59.220 --> 38:02.860
The blood, toil, tears, and sweat thing is an attempt to stress to his government that

38:02.860 --> 38:05.580
he's working hard despite a short speech.

38:05.580 --> 38:09.020
I'm promising you the blood.

38:09.020 --> 38:13.060
After this, Churchill comments on his strategy for fighting World War II, which is the other

38:13.060 --> 38:17.780
part of what I think Alex is mixing up here, quote, you ask what is our policy?

38:17.780 --> 38:22.540
I can say it is to wage war, by sea, land, and air, with all our might and with all our

38:22.540 --> 38:24.340
strength that God can give us.

38:24.340 --> 38:29.500
To wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalog

38:29.500 --> 38:30.980
of human crime.

38:30.980 --> 38:32.340
That is our policy.

38:32.340 --> 38:33.560
You ask what is our aim?

38:33.560 --> 38:35.060
I can answer in one word.

38:35.060 --> 38:40.220
It is victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long

38:40.220 --> 38:44.340
and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival.

38:44.340 --> 38:47.420
So the elements of- Slightly more eloquent than Alex makes it

38:47.420 --> 38:48.420
sound.

38:48.420 --> 38:49.420
Yeah.

38:49.420 --> 38:50.420
I will give you blood.

38:50.420 --> 38:58.400
I am reminded of the great Churchill quote, what is best in life?

38:58.400 --> 39:03.900
To crush your enemies with blood, see them driven before you, and hear the levitations

39:03.900 --> 39:05.860
of the weapons!

39:05.860 --> 39:10.620
Yeah, that wasn't good.

39:10.620 --> 39:15.120
I think that that is definitely the quote that he's mixing up, because-

39:15.120 --> 39:16.120
It sounds right.

39:16.120 --> 39:22.020
Whenever he does his really shitty Churchill impression, that's the, by land, by air.

39:22.020 --> 39:25.620
That's the quote that he does, so I assume it's the only reference he has.

39:25.620 --> 39:29.540
It's whatever pull he has and however he's changed it in the moment in his drunken, idle

39:29.540 --> 39:30.540
brain.

39:30.540 --> 39:31.540
Yeah.

39:31.540 --> 39:36.060
I know that a lot of people are struggling, I think a lot of people had a tough time with

39:36.060 --> 39:40.980
watching the events that unfolded on Wednesday, and granted this is Tuesday, but Alex still

39:40.980 --> 39:45.100
recognizes that there's a lot of people in pain, and maybe some people in the audience

39:45.100 --> 39:46.100
are feeling in pain.

39:46.100 --> 39:47.100
Sure.

39:47.100 --> 39:48.100
And they shouldn't.

39:48.100 --> 39:49.100
This is his message of- Unity.

39:49.100 --> 39:50.100
No.

39:50.100 --> 39:51.100
No hope.

39:51.100 --> 39:52.100
God no.

39:52.100 --> 39:53.100
No.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.100
No.

39:54.100 --> 39:55.100
This is what he's- He's bringing the country together, this is how he's-

39:55.100 --> 39:58.100
He wants to comfort anybody in the audience who might be feeling alone.

39:58.100 --> 40:00.100
Alright, good.

40:00.100 --> 40:08.140
No matter if you're in a jail cell, or no matter if you're dying of cancer, or no matter

40:08.140 --> 40:14.580
if your car broke down in the middle of the desert, the God of the universe built you,

40:14.580 --> 40:17.300
and the God of the universe loves you.

40:17.300 --> 40:24.220
And the God of the universe will deliver and fulfill you, but you must have faith and open

40:24.220 --> 40:25.220
that channel.

40:25.220 --> 40:31.140
And that's why, in closing, I'm so honored to be here tonight.

40:31.140 --> 40:32.140
Okay.

40:32.140 --> 40:33.140
Alright.

40:33.140 --> 40:36.420
I love the idea of Owen Schroyer sitting off stage left and just being like, this guy's

40:36.420 --> 40:37.420
got the goods.

40:37.420 --> 40:40.420
This is- I will follow- Oh captain, my captain.

40:40.420 --> 40:44.940
You sitting there taking notes?

40:44.940 --> 40:48.180
Or Owen is in the back listening to his set.

40:48.180 --> 40:49.820
He'd recorded his set.

40:49.820 --> 40:53.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, in order to improve later, because he's got another set to do

40:53.100 --> 40:54.100
later on tonight.

40:54.100 --> 40:55.100
Yeah, yeah.

40:55.100 --> 40:57.460
He's got another set for his buddy to get done with his set, so they can both get in

40:57.460 --> 41:00.500
the car and go to fucking hidden shamrock.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.500
Why not do it?

41:01.500 --> 41:05.100
Although, I do hear that, and I kind of think to myself, it would be really interesting

41:05.100 --> 41:08.420
to see Alex Jones' motivational speaker.

41:08.420 --> 41:14.060
You know, like, hey, hey, you lost your job, you lost your job, that sucks, it sucks, man,

41:14.060 --> 41:15.420
it sucks, but guess what?

41:15.420 --> 41:18.940
You're made in God's image.

41:18.940 --> 41:24.220
No matter what you got, he just minimizes your problem, and he just tells you that God

41:24.220 --> 41:25.820
made you out of stardust or whatever.

41:25.820 --> 41:28.020
Hey, I know you're poor.

41:28.020 --> 41:29.020
God's fine with that though.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.020
Come on now.

41:30.020 --> 41:31.020
Let's get it together.

41:31.020 --> 41:32.020
Let's move on.

41:32.020 --> 41:33.020
Let's move on.

41:33.020 --> 41:37.220
So here's the end of Alex's speech, and where we will leave the Stop the Steal rally from

41:37.220 --> 41:38.220
January 5th.

41:38.220 --> 41:39.220
The globalists want to play God.

41:39.220 --> 41:40.220
They are not God.

41:40.220 --> 42:00.220
And the answer to their 1984 charity is 1776, 1776, 1776, 1776.

42:00.220 --> 42:09.220
I'm so honored to be here with General Flynn and Roger Stone and others coming up, but

42:09.220 --> 42:14.620
they are just as important as you are, whether you be black, whether you be white, whether

42:14.620 --> 42:21.420
you be old, whether you be young, God made you, and God loves you, and they will never

42:21.420 --> 42:22.980
separate us.

42:22.980 --> 42:25.220
We will prevail.

42:25.220 --> 42:26.220
Amen.

42:26.220 --> 42:27.220
Whoa.

42:27.220 --> 42:28.220
Wild.

42:28.220 --> 42:29.220
Very weird.

42:29.220 --> 42:30.220
Yeah.

42:30.220 --> 42:32.780
You gotta end on 1776.

42:32.780 --> 42:33.780
You bet.

42:33.780 --> 42:34.780
The end.

42:34.780 --> 42:35.780
End of set.

42:35.780 --> 42:36.780
Yep.

42:36.780 --> 42:37.780
Walk off.

42:37.780 --> 42:39.820
You've completely blanked on who else is speaking.

42:39.820 --> 42:40.820
Nope.

42:40.820 --> 42:41.820
Except for General Flynn.

42:41.820 --> 42:42.820
Nope.

42:42.820 --> 42:43.820
You don't need to end with amen.

42:43.820 --> 42:44.820
Uh-uh.

42:44.820 --> 42:45.820
It's a weird ramble.

42:45.820 --> 42:46.820
None of it.

42:46.820 --> 42:47.820
Yeah, you can end with the chanting of 1776.

42:47.820 --> 42:48.820
You nailed it.

42:48.820 --> 42:53.020
Although he does still leave the question in your mind, what does he think that means?

42:53.020 --> 42:56.140
You got people storming the Capitol the next day.

42:56.140 --> 42:57.140
Yeah.

42:57.140 --> 43:01.180
You got him inspiring chants of 1776, 1774.

43:01.180 --> 43:02.180
Sure.

43:02.180 --> 43:03.180
Sure.

43:03.180 --> 43:04.180
It kind of, I mean, look.

43:04.180 --> 43:07.040
I don't understand what you're, are you drawing a connection between the two?

43:07.040 --> 43:08.040
I'm not necessarily.

43:08.040 --> 43:10.180
I'm just saying there's a narrative consistency.

43:10.180 --> 43:15.200
That's one way of putting it.

43:15.200 --> 43:20.740
If these two events were in a fictional story and the author were arguing that one led to

43:20.740 --> 43:22.460
the other, it would make sense.

43:22.460 --> 43:23.580
It would make sense, yes.

43:23.580 --> 43:25.100
I'm not saying that they do.

43:25.100 --> 43:27.740
I'm not saying that Alex did cause anything.

43:27.740 --> 43:28.980
I'm just saying.

43:28.980 --> 43:33.820
From an entropy standpoint, if you were going to put one in front of the other, I think

43:33.820 --> 43:36.260
you know which you would choose.

43:36.260 --> 43:40.500
So now we go to the sixth and we will be here for a while.

43:40.500 --> 43:44.940
We'll be spending a little bit of time in the Infowars Trenches, yes.

43:44.940 --> 43:50.580
But it doesn't happen until almost the end of Alex's show.

43:50.580 --> 43:51.580
Sure.

43:51.580 --> 43:55.620
Actually, it's probably in the second hour, I think is when the actual like going over

43:55.620 --> 43:56.620
the barricades.

43:56.620 --> 43:57.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:57.620 --> 43:58.620
When it started popping off.

43:58.620 --> 44:02.380
And then it proceeded to get wild pretty fast.

44:02.380 --> 44:09.800
And yeah, we'll deal with that as best we can as we go along.

44:09.800 --> 44:14.580
But we're still in this sort of much more innocent time now because we're listening

44:14.580 --> 44:16.100
to the American Journal.

44:16.100 --> 44:17.100
Sure.

44:17.100 --> 44:18.460
Which again is supposed to be a call-in show.

44:18.460 --> 44:19.460
There's no calls.

44:19.460 --> 44:20.460
There's no calls.

44:20.460 --> 44:21.460
No calls.

44:21.460 --> 44:22.460
Zero calls?

44:22.460 --> 44:23.460
Not even one call.

44:23.460 --> 44:27.720
I remember Alex saying that whoever's hosting this show, if they're not taking calls, they're

44:27.720 --> 44:29.220
not going to be hosting it anymore.

44:29.220 --> 44:30.220
So bad news, Harrison.

44:30.220 --> 44:31.220
You're fired.

44:31.220 --> 44:36.660
We are going to get a 17-year-old host very shortly.

44:36.660 --> 44:37.820
I think we already have one.

44:37.820 --> 44:38.820
Oh, that's true.

44:38.820 --> 44:41.300
Harrison could be a baby for all I know.

44:41.300 --> 44:44.840
I think he's like a high school sophomore.

44:44.840 --> 44:45.840
He's there on an internship.

44:45.840 --> 44:46.840
Sure, sure.

44:46.840 --> 44:47.840
He's not even getting paid.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.020
He's the AV Club guy.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.940
He's got an extra block free and they let him do a work program.

44:51.940 --> 44:52.940
Yeah, yeah.

44:52.940 --> 44:53.940
I gotcha.

44:53.940 --> 44:56.740
Alex is sponsoring him at the local college or high school.

44:56.740 --> 44:57.740
Yeah, he gets credit.

44:57.740 --> 44:58.740
Yeah, I like it.

44:58.740 --> 45:03.100
The news of the day for him at the beginning is that there's this Trump rally that's going

45:03.100 --> 45:08.020
to be going on, but also Georgia got stolen.

45:08.020 --> 45:09.020
Wow.

45:09.020 --> 45:10.020
What do you expect?

45:10.020 --> 45:11.020
They haven't been punished.

45:11.020 --> 45:12.620
Of course, they're going to do it again.

45:12.620 --> 45:14.240
And so they did it again.

45:14.240 --> 45:18.740
And so Georgia looks like it was lost.

45:18.740 --> 45:24.060
I think one of the, I'll get an update here, but as far as I know, both races are projected

45:24.060 --> 45:33.340
to be Democrat victories, although one is still on that hairline victory margin.

45:33.340 --> 45:35.500
Donald Trump Jr. is live right now on the stage.

45:35.500 --> 45:36.500
I want to go to him.

45:36.500 --> 45:38.260
He, I think, has a major future.

45:38.260 --> 45:44.820
If there's anybody that could succeed his father, I remember seeing him give a speech

45:44.820 --> 45:49.900
at the RNC in 2016 and thinking, I'm putting my money on this guy.

45:49.900 --> 45:55.460
This guy, uh, this guy can carry his father's mantle and keep that torch lit.

45:55.460 --> 45:58.220
Let's go to him now and watch this live feed.

45:58.220 --> 46:00.340
This Don Jr. kid's got something.

46:00.340 --> 46:01.340
Wow.

46:01.340 --> 46:02.340
Yeah.

46:02.340 --> 46:03.340
So he's the future.

46:03.340 --> 46:05.400
I think Harrison's the future for sure.

46:05.400 --> 46:10.060
The way he intro'd that clip made me real excited to hear what I wanted to hear.

46:10.060 --> 46:11.060
Yeah.

46:11.060 --> 46:14.020
Georgia has been stolen again because they didn't get punished for stealing last time.

46:14.020 --> 46:15.020
Yeah.

46:15.020 --> 46:16.020
Why not?

46:16.020 --> 46:19.340
Uh, I found myself very bored listening to Harrison, but I do think that he has a word

46:19.340 --> 46:20.340
a day calendar.

46:20.340 --> 46:21.340
Oh yeah?

46:21.340 --> 46:23.980
Uh, because he would not stop fucking saying abrogate.

46:23.980 --> 46:25.580
He said abrogate a lot?

46:25.580 --> 46:26.580
All right, get the fuck out of here.

46:26.580 --> 46:30.220
I was going to make a super cut of it, but I got to like three or four times that I'd

46:30.220 --> 46:31.940
cut it out and I was just like, I don't even care anymore.

46:31.940 --> 46:34.800
You get at most one abrogate per week.

46:34.800 --> 46:35.800
These people.

46:35.800 --> 46:36.800
Max.

46:36.800 --> 46:37.800
Mike Pence has abrogated.

46:37.800 --> 46:38.800
See, max.

46:38.800 --> 46:39.800
Yeah.

46:39.800 --> 46:40.800
One.

46:40.800 --> 46:41.800
It's a mess.

46:41.800 --> 46:42.800
Yeah.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.860
Anyway, there's a lot of stuff that I was listening to that would have just sounded

46:44.860 --> 46:51.660
like, oh, look at this braggy bullshit if people hadn't rushed the Capitol building.

46:51.660 --> 46:52.660
Yeah.

46:52.660 --> 46:53.660
Yeah.

46:53.660 --> 46:59.580
In hindsight, there's a lot of stuff that doesn't look great.

46:59.580 --> 47:00.740
Here is one of them.

47:00.740 --> 47:01.740
Okay.

47:01.740 --> 47:03.700
Truly incredible stuff.

47:03.700 --> 47:08.960
Of course, what we have just learned and I'm excited to share once again is that president

47:08.960 --> 47:15.740
Donald Trump himself personally asked Alex Jones to lead this March following Alex Jones

47:15.740 --> 47:16.740
a speech.

47:16.740 --> 47:17.740
He will be at the Vanguard.

47:17.740 --> 47:21.500
I guess he didn't want to win to the Capitol and it's a, it's truly incredible.

47:21.500 --> 47:23.460
And guys, let's just go ahead and leave that live feed up.

47:23.460 --> 47:26.180
We can leave me in a box just because it's not me.

47:26.180 --> 47:30.420
People are tuning in for, it's the incredible events going down in Washington.

47:30.420 --> 47:31.420
You're right.

47:31.420 --> 47:32.420
No one's doing it for you.

47:32.420 --> 47:33.420
That's for sure.

47:33.420 --> 47:34.420
God damn right.

47:34.420 --> 47:35.420
You are.

47:35.420 --> 47:40.980
I would say that now, uh, it would probably be, you know, had they have known that people

47:40.980 --> 47:44.180
were going to storm the Capitol, I don't think they would've lied that big.

47:44.180 --> 47:50.260
No, I would assume that the storyline wouldn't be Alex Jones was personally asked by Trump

47:50.260 --> 47:54.260
to leave the March from the speech to the Capitol building.

47:54.260 --> 47:55.260
Yeah.

47:55.260 --> 47:56.260
Yeah.

47:56.260 --> 47:58.260
That doesn't seem like, I would want that one off my resume pretty quick.

47:58.260 --> 47:59.260
Yeah.

47:59.260 --> 48:00.260
Yeah.

48:00.260 --> 48:02.580
Um, also this looks just kind of silly in hindsight.

48:02.580 --> 48:05.860
That's the message that we need to tell the police is you're a human being.

48:05.860 --> 48:07.140
You're not a robot.

48:07.140 --> 48:08.820
You know what's going on here.

48:08.820 --> 48:11.620
You know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are.

48:11.620 --> 48:14.020
Shouldn't be confusing to you.

48:14.020 --> 48:18.260
Shouldn't be up in the air for you when you have hordes of, you know, just black lives

48:18.260 --> 48:23.780
matter, just failures, just supported by the state coming out to the Capitol city to try

48:23.780 --> 48:28.500
to burn down buildings, to try to tear down statues, just yell at police and call them

48:28.500 --> 48:30.020
all sorts of horrible things.

48:30.020 --> 48:34.660
Then you have interest from protesters marching, saying thank you to the cops saying, you know,

48:34.660 --> 48:35.660
we support you.

48:35.660 --> 48:36.660
Interesting.

48:36.660 --> 48:40.420
It's not too difficult to know who the bad guys are and who the good guys are a couple

48:40.420 --> 48:41.420
hours later.

48:41.420 --> 48:46.020
Interesting, interesting things you're saying a couple hours later, not so thrilled with

48:46.020 --> 48:47.020
the cops.

48:47.020 --> 48:52.220
Perhaps, perhaps you may not be viewing yourselves through the appropriate lens.

48:52.220 --> 48:54.620
I think I might be right.

48:54.620 --> 48:59.620
So one of the things I found really interesting is Harrison's doing play by play of this Trump

48:59.620 --> 49:00.620
rally.

49:00.620 --> 49:06.580
And so you had Don Jr. who's this fresh upstart, he's got a bright future ahead of him.

49:06.580 --> 49:13.340
Now there is an actual GOP upstart who's really like kind of a hot commodity in the right

49:13.340 --> 49:14.820
wing, and that is Madison Cawthorn.

49:14.820 --> 49:17.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Nazi who's in a wheelchair.

49:17.540 --> 49:20.140
Yeah, and he's like 25 or something like that.

49:20.140 --> 49:22.180
It doesn't take long for him to go full Nazi.

49:22.180 --> 49:25.580
Like he looks like the person you would want on all kinds of ad campaigns.

49:25.580 --> 49:26.580
Yeah, absolutely.

49:26.580 --> 49:28.660
I mean, if he weren't a Nazi.

49:28.660 --> 49:33.860
Sure, I don't, I don't know enough about his politics to really parse everything, but based

49:33.860 --> 49:36.780
on the speech, I'm not thrilled with him.

49:36.780 --> 49:37.780
But it's interesting.

49:37.780 --> 49:43.020
I do still know who he is, square jaw and all.

49:43.020 --> 49:44.260
Sure, sure.

49:44.260 --> 49:45.260
Sure.

49:45.260 --> 49:46.260
Yeah.

49:46.260 --> 49:47.260
Handsome.

49:47.260 --> 49:48.260
Yeah.

49:48.260 --> 49:51.180
But Harrison doesn't know who he is.

49:51.180 --> 49:52.180
Really?

49:52.180 --> 49:54.260
Madison Cawthorn comes up to give the speech.

49:54.260 --> 49:57.460
He's up like next and he's like Madison something?

49:57.460 --> 49:58.460
That's fantastic.

49:58.460 --> 50:05.820
Yeah, this is, I believe his name is, he's a new, he's a new congressman, I believe his

50:05.820 --> 50:11.900
name is, I'm blanking on his name right now, Madison or something, but he was just elected.

50:11.900 --> 50:14.380
He's promised to stand up for Trump against Stop the Steal.

50:14.380 --> 50:15.380
Wild.

50:15.380 --> 50:17.460
Just the depth of awareness.

50:17.460 --> 50:23.700
I want this to be Info Wars' new entire tone.

50:23.700 --> 50:26.220
I want Harrison Smith to host every show.

50:26.220 --> 50:28.420
I think this is dynamite stuff here.

50:28.420 --> 50:32.180
Greg looks familiar.

50:32.180 --> 50:37.140
So Madison Cawthorn's up there doing his, doing his speech and just to show that everyone

50:37.140 --> 50:38.140
is a dork.

50:38.140 --> 50:43.420
My friends, I want you to chant with me so loud that the cowards on White Washington

50:43.420 --> 50:45.420
DC that I serve with can hear you.

50:45.420 --> 50:50.180
While I leave, let's get a chance so Donald Trump knows who supports him.

50:50.180 --> 50:51.180
USA!

50:51.180 --> 50:52.180
USA!

50:52.180 --> 50:53.180
USA!

50:53.180 --> 50:54.180
USA!

50:54.180 --> 50:55.620
Love that USA chant.

50:55.620 --> 50:58.900
It is a parody of a parody at this point.

50:58.900 --> 50:59.900
It is.

50:59.900 --> 51:00.900
Yeah, it's bizarre.

51:00.900 --> 51:01.900
It really is.

51:01.900 --> 51:02.900
Yeah.

51:02.900 --> 51:03.900
Speaking of parodies of parodies.

51:03.900 --> 51:04.900
Yeah.

51:04.900 --> 51:05.900
Up next, Rudy Giuliani.

51:05.900 --> 51:06.900
Oh!

51:06.900 --> 51:07.900
Here we go!

51:07.900 --> 51:11.860
Rudy is giving a speech and man, man oh man.

51:11.860 --> 51:16.900
So a lot of people took issue with him saying that he suggests trial by combat and then

51:16.900 --> 51:18.300
people stormed the White House.

51:18.300 --> 51:20.980
Yeah, which is objectively hilarious.

51:20.980 --> 51:25.380
It is, it is, because it's a poor choice of words.

51:25.380 --> 51:30.620
No, look, I mean, I get why you would be hand-wringing over that.

51:30.620 --> 51:31.620
I understand it.

51:31.620 --> 51:32.620
I do too.

51:32.620 --> 51:36.220
But nobody says trial by combat meaning storm a building.

51:36.220 --> 51:38.940
Sure, it means one-on-one combat in Game of Thrones.

51:38.940 --> 51:41.220
It means a duel, it means, yeah, yeah.

51:41.220 --> 51:43.380
He was being very flowery and stupid.

51:43.380 --> 51:45.380
But even so, that's not what he was talking about.

51:45.380 --> 51:46.380
No, of course not.

51:46.380 --> 51:49.540
If you actually listen to the context, he's talking about the reputation of Donald Trump

51:49.540 --> 51:51.500
versus the reputation of Joe Biden.

51:51.500 --> 51:52.500
Totally.

51:52.500 --> 51:53.500
And he's just trying to argue-

51:53.500 --> 51:56.980
The Mountain versus the Sand Snakes or whatever, that's what it, yeah, yeah.

51:56.980 --> 52:00.060
He's saying trial by combat, he's not talking about the two of them actually fighting.

52:00.060 --> 52:01.060
Of course.

52:01.060 --> 52:05.840
He wants ten days, his whole argument is he wants ten days for them to go on a fucking

52:05.840 --> 52:11.220
fishing experiment, expedition, and try and find something in the ballots that they can

52:11.220 --> 52:14.220
make an argument, but of course he's not presenting it that way.

52:14.220 --> 52:18.500
He's saying it'll take ten days for them to find the fraud that they already know is there

52:18.500 --> 52:19.500
or something.

52:19.500 --> 52:20.980
What a fantastic, arbitrary measure of time.

52:20.980 --> 52:21.980
Yeah.

52:21.980 --> 52:22.980
I love ten.

52:22.980 --> 52:23.980
Ten days.

52:23.980 --> 52:24.980
Exactly ten.

52:24.980 --> 52:31.900
So over the next ten days, we get to see the machines that are crooked, the ballots that

52:31.900 --> 52:36.380
are fraudulent, and if we're wrong, we will be made fools of.

52:36.380 --> 52:37.640
Too late.

52:37.640 --> 52:43.300
But if we're right, a lot of them will go to jail.

52:43.300 --> 52:52.180
So let's have trial by combat.

52:52.180 --> 52:57.740
I'm willing to stake, I'm willing to stake my reputation, the president is willing to

52:57.740 --> 53:04.400
stake his reputation, on the fact that we're going to find criminality there.

53:04.400 --> 53:08.920
If I were Rudy Giuliani and I could get anyone to gamble against my reputation, I don't care

53:08.920 --> 53:11.520
what I stand to win, I'm taking that bet.

53:11.520 --> 53:12.720
His reputation ain't worth shit.

53:12.720 --> 53:17.980
I can't think of two reputations more worthless at this point in time.

53:17.980 --> 53:18.980
Amazing.

53:18.980 --> 53:23.980
Rudy Giuliani, I'm gambling for like a sandwich against my reputation.

53:23.980 --> 53:30.260
Everything that I have, every bit of my reputation, from 9-11's mayor to standing in front of

53:30.260 --> 53:34.100
the Four Seasons Landscaping Company, yeah.

53:34.100 --> 53:40.340
So I got a little bored at this point, because Harrison is really just, you know, covering

53:40.340 --> 53:46.180
these speeches, and it's a lot of speeches, and so I was actually pretty pumped to see

53:46.180 --> 53:47.180
this.

53:47.180 --> 53:49.740
It was an amazing, exclusive interview.

53:49.740 --> 53:54.340
Right now we have an exclusive, we are on the line with Rob Dew, who is there at the

53:54.340 --> 53:57.660
Save America March, live on the ground.

53:57.660 --> 54:02.620
Thanks for connecting with us, Rob, I know it's difficult to get cell phone signal there

54:02.620 --> 54:04.780
with all of the massive crowds.

54:04.780 --> 54:08.060
What is it like there on the ground, Rob?

54:08.060 --> 54:11.860
It's a sea of patriots, it's a sea of happy people, really.

54:11.860 --> 54:13.260
How do you land this interview?

54:13.260 --> 54:14.980
How do you get the exclusive?

54:14.980 --> 54:19.020
I cannot believe you would describe that as an exclusive.

54:19.020 --> 54:20.900
Oh man.

54:20.900 --> 54:25.580
It is also technically one of the most accurate ways you can use the word exclusive.

54:25.580 --> 54:26.580
Yeah.

54:26.580 --> 54:27.580
I agree.

54:27.580 --> 54:30.860
I just love to imagine that all the networks are knocking down Rob Dew's door.

54:30.860 --> 54:31.860
We gotta get Rob Dew!

54:31.860 --> 54:33.100
We gotta get Rob Dew!

54:33.100 --> 54:38.700
Guys, I would love to go on Fox News today, but I've got an exclusive with Harrison Smith.

54:38.700 --> 54:40.820
Sorry, I have an exclusivity deal.

54:40.820 --> 54:41.940
Promised it earlier today.

54:41.940 --> 54:43.780
Because they really want my analysis.

54:43.780 --> 54:45.780
I gotta get the Dew in there, you know?

54:45.780 --> 54:54.140
So Rob Dew, ever the fumbly dum-dum, I can't even come up with the right words to express

54:54.140 --> 54:55.980
how much of a goof this guy is.

54:55.980 --> 54:58.100
I believe he's just schlemazel.

54:58.100 --> 54:59.100
Sure.

54:59.100 --> 55:00.100
Yeah.

55:00.100 --> 55:02.580
He's gotta come in and get a little piece of that pie.

55:02.580 --> 55:07.180
And that pie, of course, is saying things that look really bad in hindsight.

55:07.180 --> 55:10.820
Right when the president starts speaking, about halfway through, Alex is gonna pull

55:10.820 --> 55:16.060
out and then we're gonna lead that march to the capitol to surround it and let these thugs

55:16.060 --> 55:20.180
that are trying to steal our republic know what's gonna happen to them if they do go

55:20.180 --> 55:22.420
through with their dastardly deeds.

55:22.420 --> 55:24.860
Yeah, and you know, I wish I was there.

55:24.860 --> 55:26.820
I mean, the energy must be amazing.

55:26.820 --> 55:32.340
So I guess Rob is expressing that the intention of the march is to scare the Congress into

55:32.340 --> 55:35.860
not certifying the results of the election, which is cool.

55:35.860 --> 55:40.620
What they need to know is that we are a threat to them, physically.

55:40.620 --> 55:42.660
They should be scared for their lives.

55:42.660 --> 55:43.820
What we're gonna do to them.

55:43.820 --> 55:48.580
And we are going to follow through on that threat should they not give us what we want.

55:48.580 --> 55:49.580
Yeah, exactly.

55:49.580 --> 55:50.580
So, Arizona's pumped.

55:50.580 --> 55:51.580
Of course.

55:51.580 --> 55:52.580
All right, folks.

55:52.580 --> 55:55.580
So Donald Trump coming up next, Alex Jones leading the march to the capitol.

55:55.580 --> 55:56.580
What are we doing?

55:56.580 --> 55:57.580
What are we doing?

55:57.580 --> 56:03.860
It's January 6th, 2021, and the revolution, the second American revolution has begun.

56:03.860 --> 56:06.100
He can't quite do that out to break like Alex does.

56:06.100 --> 56:08.380
It won't go the distance.

56:08.380 --> 56:09.580
It will go fast.

56:09.580 --> 56:10.580
Yeah.

56:10.580 --> 56:15.380
And Alex does that thing where he goes out to break with some overly dramatic, really

56:15.380 --> 56:17.740
exciting thing.

56:17.740 --> 56:22.340
You can see he's trying to do some of Alex's tricks, but he just can't.

56:22.340 --> 56:23.340
He doesn't have it.

56:23.340 --> 56:24.340
No.

56:24.340 --> 56:29.180
And it's also embarrassing, again, to know that a couple hours after this, people storm

56:29.180 --> 56:31.180
the capitol.

56:31.180 --> 56:33.060
I think it's a little bit weird that...

56:33.060 --> 56:38.020
I understand being nervous, but it's not like this is Harrison Smith's first time on mic.

56:38.020 --> 56:40.140
Like he's been on mic for a long time.

56:40.140 --> 56:41.140
Yes.

56:41.140 --> 56:46.380
How do you not just allow yourself into the joy of following out with music?

56:46.380 --> 56:47.380
I don't know.

56:47.380 --> 56:48.380
You know?

56:48.380 --> 56:49.380
How could you not get pumped?

56:49.380 --> 56:51.420
How could you not even like at least sing a little bit along?

56:51.420 --> 56:53.100
He sounds bored and disinfected.

56:53.100 --> 56:54.100
It sucks.

56:54.100 --> 56:57.340
Probably because Alex would hear about it and he'd beat him up for working his side

56:57.340 --> 56:58.340
of the street.

56:58.340 --> 56:59.340
Sure.

56:59.340 --> 57:00.340
No.

57:00.340 --> 57:01.340
That's fair.

57:01.340 --> 57:02.340
That's my game.

57:02.340 --> 57:03.340
Yeah, but get a little into it.

57:03.340 --> 57:04.340
Get a little hips.

57:04.340 --> 57:05.340
Get your hips into it, man.

57:05.340 --> 57:08.740
If I worked at Infowars and I was hosting when Alex was gone or something like that,

57:08.740 --> 57:12.380
I would come in for a break with Silver Stally and I'd sing along.

57:12.380 --> 57:13.380
Non-stop.

57:13.380 --> 57:16.540
I'd just begging Alex to fire me.

57:16.540 --> 57:21.340
I would have callers call in and then be like, you're boring, and play a song and sing instead.

57:21.340 --> 57:22.340
It would be great.

57:22.340 --> 57:23.460
It would always be the highway.

57:23.460 --> 57:25.900
Everyone would go crazy.

57:25.900 --> 57:33.140
So we sensed a little bit of perhaps racial animus earlier from Harrison, his Black Lives

57:33.140 --> 57:36.300
Matter failures and what have you.

57:36.300 --> 57:37.300
Sure.

57:37.300 --> 57:40.180
You can see a little bit more of that on display here.

57:40.180 --> 57:46.340
If the Democrats are allowed to carry out this fraud, first of all, they'll do it again

57:46.340 --> 57:48.420
and again and again and again and again.

57:48.420 --> 57:56.020
They'll also increase the number of immigrants by magnitudes of 10, refugees by many, many

57:56.020 --> 57:57.020
millions.

57:57.020 --> 57:59.620
They'll completely open the borders outright.

57:59.620 --> 58:07.620
They'll install socialistic programs that reward people that don't work, don't provide,

58:07.620 --> 58:09.460
have nothing but hatred for us.

58:09.460 --> 58:11.780
I think I see Owen Schroyer there.

58:11.780 --> 58:14.620
Do you see him right there to the left of the stage?

58:14.620 --> 58:15.980
Screen left, stage right.

58:15.980 --> 58:19.420
Owen Schroyer just stood up and is looking around.

58:19.420 --> 58:20.420
That's him, right?

58:20.420 --> 58:24.480
I do think that moment is a little cute at the end because if you're watching the video,

58:24.480 --> 58:27.500
you can see almost real excitement when he sees Owen.

58:27.500 --> 58:28.500
Oh, look at Owen!

58:28.500 --> 58:29.500
Hey!

58:29.500 --> 58:32.020
I think that him and Owen might actually be friends.

58:32.020 --> 58:33.020
I think that sounds right.

58:33.020 --> 58:37.980
Because later on when Owen's on the phone and the two of them, I think, talk over each

58:37.980 --> 58:42.740
other or something, there's some kind of a weird thing, they both apologize to each other

58:42.740 --> 58:43.740
in a way.

58:43.740 --> 58:44.740
That's cute.

58:44.740 --> 58:45.740
Well, it's not so much that it's cute.

58:45.740 --> 58:46.740
It seems human.

58:46.740 --> 58:47.740
Yeah.

58:47.740 --> 58:48.740
It seems like how people would interact.

58:48.740 --> 58:49.740
I know.

58:49.740 --> 58:50.740
That's what I'm saying.

58:50.740 --> 58:53.120
Whereas it's cute that these automatons...

58:53.120 --> 58:56.020
Watching Alex interact with people, it's so goddamn rude all the time.

58:56.020 --> 58:58.620
He's got half a mouthful of sandwich.

58:58.620 --> 59:00.120
Yeah, exactly.

59:00.120 --> 59:02.900
It's bizarre to see actual excitement.

59:02.900 --> 59:06.420
See my friend on TV and then also polite conversation.

59:06.420 --> 59:07.420
It's bizarre.

59:07.420 --> 59:09.140
Oh my god, Owen's on The Price is Right.

59:09.140 --> 59:11.140
Owen's on The Price is Right, guys!

59:11.140 --> 59:12.140
Everybody get around!

59:12.140 --> 59:13.140
The standards are so low.

59:13.140 --> 59:21.220
Anyway, I'm a guy who's just shoveling a little pile of stuff that looks bad in hindsight.

59:21.220 --> 59:22.220
Sure, sure.

59:22.220 --> 59:23.220
Just gonna add to that.

59:23.220 --> 59:24.220
Digging that deeper.

59:24.220 --> 59:25.220
Just gonna add to that pile over here.

59:25.220 --> 59:26.220
Yep, okay.

59:26.220 --> 59:27.220
Whoop, what's this?

59:27.220 --> 59:28.220
Oh, it's a big one.

59:28.220 --> 59:36.620
So today is the day that the Congress will vote on whether or not to certify and codify

59:36.620 --> 59:42.620
the so-called fraudulent results of the election.

59:42.620 --> 59:50.860
There are many machinations that could be pulled out here in the last minutes or so,

59:50.860 --> 59:51.860
the last hours.

59:51.860 --> 59:56.580
And of course, it's not really over until January 20th, but today is the day that we've

59:56.580 --> 59:57.580
all been waiting for.

59:57.580 --> 01:00:03.020
It's the day that Donald Trump himself requested his supporters come to Washington DC to see

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:08.360
him speak and to stand up against the lies, disinformation, and fraud of the mainstream

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.540
media and their controllers in the deep state.

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:13.540
Truly incredible stuff.

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:19.140
Of course, the word is that Alex Jones was requested by Donald Trump himself to lead

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.140
the march.

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.140
Really driving that home.

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:22.140
Oh boy.

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.940
I mean, he only said it twice, though.

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:27.980
I would have to hear it three times in order for it to be like, well, yeah, that would

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:28.980
be a pattern.

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:32.100
You know, once or twice is isolated incidents.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:37.300
In just a few minutes, Alex Jones will actually be leading the march to the Capitol at the

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:40.620
behest, at the personal request of President Donald Trump.

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:48.380
Alex Jones will be at the head of that vanguard as the entire crowd, this massive human snake,

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:56.340
this huge, just unimaginable almost crowd of Trump supporters who have made their way

01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:01.260
to the nation's Capitol, will wind its way towards the Capitol building.

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:03.580
Oh, so they're going to the Capitol building.

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:04.580
Wow.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:05.580
This all looks really bad.

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:10.700
What a just glowing way to describe your friends and people you love.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:13.380
They look like a giant human snake.

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:14.380
Yeah.

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:20.300
So the mood is jovial among Trump supporters in D.C., or at least that's what Harrison

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:24.740
is guessing, of course, based on his assessment of it from occupied Texas.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:25.740
Yeah.

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:26.740
Come back, folks.

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:29.500
The mood is still a jovial one here.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:34.540
And of course, as Rob Doo reported live on the scene there at the Save America March

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:37.980
in Washington, D.C., it's like it's uplifting.

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:38.980
Everybody's happy.

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:39.980
Everybody's feeling good.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:46.820
But at the same time, there's an underlying aggressiveness beneath the surface and an

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:53.900
unrest, I suppose you could say, pervading the spirit of American Trump supporters.

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:59.620
Everybody's a little bit on edge because once again, we have tried and tried and tried and

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.560
tried and tried to play within the rules.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.720
We have tried.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:11.100
To make the system change itself, to get back on track, to stop having endless drive to

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.600
bankrupt and enslave us.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:20.020
And time and time again, we are met with traitorous and seditious acts blocking us from carrying

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:27.060
out a legal, lawful within the bounds of the game changes.

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.140
And now they've prevented us at every pass.

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:33.460
Our last and final outlet was our sacred vote.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:38.060
And that is what has been stolen from us, or at least is still in the process of being

01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:39.400
stolen from us.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:45.500
So you're making the argument that the jovial mood is pierced only by the recognition that

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:51.780
there are no more legal ways for you to deal with the problems that are existentially threatening

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:53.260
to you.

01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.900
So you're saying that it's time to do illegal things.

01:02:55.900 --> 01:03:02.500
It is a solemn moment that we must decide to extrajudicially take back our republic.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:06.660
And it just so happens that that's exactly what we wanted to do, so we're feeling pretty

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:07.780
good about it right now.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:12.060
It's a real jovial atmosphere, we're gonna kill a few people, it's gonna be great.

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:16.660
There'll be some jaunty music playing in the background.

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:21.520
We got a flapper contingent over there, they're doing a little...

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:30.340
So earlier in the episode we already heard Harrison saying that we had the stolen.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:34.320
The Georgia election, the runoff was stolen.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:40.220
So this bit of news that he comes to at the end of his show seems almost unbelievable.

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:49.660
Jack Pessobic reports that the Senate races in Georgia attracted 300,000 less votes than

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:56.460
Donald Trump got for president, indicating that the base stayed home.

01:03:56.460 --> 01:04:02.020
Why would we go out of our way to support a party that refuses to lift a single finger

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:28.140
for the president of the United States who we all voted for?

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:32.900
These seem to be counter explanations for something.

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:36.180
They almost seem at odds with one another.

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:40.260
It almost seems that intentionally Infowars has self-contradictory narratives.

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:41.620
Right, right, right, right.

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:46.680
Perhaps even one would suggest that they don't even know what they believe is happening.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.820
Maybe they're very confused.

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:50.620
Maybe they just report what feels good.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.860
It feels right that they stole it.

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:53.860
Now obviously people didn't show up.

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:57.200
It also feels right that people would punish the GOP for abandoning Trump.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.780
It makes sense that they wouldn't show up.

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:00.660
Yeah, but also they stole it.

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:01.660
They stole it.

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:02.660
Yeah.

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:06.460
Now, I mean, obviously it might have something to do with us saying that they stole elections

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:10.420
and that elections don't matter, so your vote doesn't matter, so it doesn't matter if you

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:11.420
vote.

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.860
Ali Alexander's making a lot of money off the stuff that's stealing the vote.

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:14.860
Exactly.

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:15.860
We're getting a taste.

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:16.860
I like it.

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:17.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:22.180
So Harrison's hosting Alex's show, so it's basically just a smooth transition into the

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:23.180
Alex Jones show.

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:26.580
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Alex Jones show.

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:27.580
I'm Harrison Smith.

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:32.580
It's January 6th, and Donald Trump has just begun speaking to the Stop the Steal march

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.580
in Washington.

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:37.740
Without any further ado, we go now to the President of the United States in Washington.

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:39.300
So I apologize in advance.

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:43.980
The first hour of the show is just Trump's speech, and so we're going to have to listen

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.020
to a little bit of it.

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:49.540
I know that we generally don't listen to stuff, but this is pretty wild.

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:50.540
Sure.

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:56.060
I think that it also sets the stage for a lot of the content and the things that end

01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:57.060
up happening.

01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:58.560
I'll listen to his words.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.020
Please try not to scream too much.

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:01.020
We're recording this late.

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.260
I'm not screaming.

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:10.860
So it kind of begins with Trump rambling a bit about how his crowds are really huge and

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:11.860
fake news.

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:12.860
Unsurprising.

01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:14.860
They never show the crowds, so they won't.

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:15.860
Of course not.

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:16.860
Go ahead.

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.860
Turn your cameras, please.

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:18.860
Would you show?

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:26.380
They came from all over the world, actually, but they came from all over our country.

01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:29.140
I just really want to see what they do.

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:30.860
I just want to see how they cover it.

01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:37.860
I've never seen anything like it, but it would be really great if we could be covered fairly

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:38.860
by the media.

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:41.860
The media is the biggest problem we have as far as I'm concerned.

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.860
Single biggest problem.

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:44.860
Wow.

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:49.740
Oh, you're making whimpering dog noises.

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:53.340
Oh, what a whimpering whiny- oh, no, the media's so mean.

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:56.860
Well, if that seemed kind of soft, wait for this one.

01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:57.860
Okay.

01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:00.700
There's so many weak Republicans, and we have great ones.

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:05.780
Jim Jordan and some of these guys, they're out there fighting, the House guys are fighting,

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:07.460
but it's incredible.

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:09.460
Many of the Republicans, I helped them get in.

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.100
I helped them get elected.

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.540
I helped Mitch get elected.

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:20.580
I helped... I could name 24 of them, let's say.

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.140
I won't bore you with it.

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:24.180
What the fuck is going on?

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:30.300
Even just now, this is so bizarre that this is what's happening, that this is the speech

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.300
that he's giving.

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:35.540
What a whiny... I never listened to him.

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:36.540
It's so weak.

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:42.140
I think this is something that is underreported amongst all of his terrifying words, is how

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:45.020
much of a pathetic little whiny whiner he is.

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.500
He's a whiner.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.500
He's a whiner.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.980
He's a little tiny whiner.

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:54.100
You imagine anybody else in a leadership position complaining about, I could name 24 people

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:56.980
I've helped who are ungrateful to me.

01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:59.100
Oh my God.

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.100
Grow up.

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:02.460
I wouldn't respect that in a boss.

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:07.460
I wouldn't respect that in a contemporary.

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:10.660
I wouldn't respect that in anybody who's in elected office.

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:13.380
That is childish shit.

01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:21.380
Can you imagine Obama... They made fun of my tan suit.

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.700
Everybody's so mean to me.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.820
I helped all these Democrats get elected and they have abandoned me in my time of need

01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:30.780
when I need people to stand up for my tan suit.

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:33.500
God, it's just pathetic.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.060
This is so sad.

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:39.660
Anyway, it's been a while since I've heard a president swear.

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:42.140
And Trump says bullshit in the middle of this clip.

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:43.140
And then the audio-

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.140
Well, you weren't alive for Nixon.

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.140
Well, that's true.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:47.140
I've heard some tapes.

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:53.500
I don't know if Nixon ever swore and then a crowd of people started chanting the swear

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:54.500
he just said.

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.500
Yes, come on, do it.

01:08:55.500 --> 01:09:02.180
This year, using the pretext of the China virus and the scam of mail-in ballots, Democrats

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:07.620
attempted the most brazen and outrageous election theft, and there's never been anything like

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:10.620
this, so pure theft in American history.

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:11.620
Everybody knows it.

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:12.620
Everybody knows it.

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:15.780
That election, our election, was over at 10 o'clock in the evening.

01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:22.180
We're leading Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, by hundreds of thousands of votes.

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:23.180
I don't understand things.

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:29.720
And then late in the evening or early in the morning, boom, these explosions of bullshit.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:40.540
And all of a sudden, all of a sudden, it started to happen.

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:42.000
That's amazing.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Do you know why?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.240
Do you know why all of this shit?

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.480
Do you know?

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.480
Here's what I'll say.

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:49.960
I will say this.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.960
This is what I believe.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:56.660
As much as the cops are totally complicit with all those people getting through and

01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:02.180
all that shit, the reason that the National Guard and all of those people weren't already

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:05.660
at the ready is because of shit like this.

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.940
This is professional wrestling.

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:13.980
None of these people thought that any of this was real.

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:19.020
You're telling me that a crowd of people who's listening to the President of the United States,

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:24.060
a goddamn, the biggest economy in the world, a nuclear fucking power, is going to get taken

01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:29.220
down by a crowd of assholes screaming, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:30.220
It's perfect.

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:31.220
Yes.

01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:32.220
Yes.

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:33.220
Yes.

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.220
Yes.

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.220
Yes.

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.220
Yes.

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:37.220
It's the same shit.

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:38.220
It's weird.

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:39.220
It's pathetic.

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:40.220
Yeah.

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:42.340
There are definite elements of overlap.

01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:45.900
And when you're losing in a wrestling match, you got to fight harder.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.120
And that's what Trump says people got to do.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:52.760
This is keep in mind right before people stormed the Capitol.

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:55.880
And we want to be so nice.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:01.820
We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people.

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:04.700
And we're going to have to fight much harder.

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.580
And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us.

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:16.660
And if he doesn't, that will be a sad day for our country because you're sworn to uphold

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:20.540
our Constitution.

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:26.500
Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy.

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:31.340
Donald Trump giving it to Republicans and Democrats alike in defense of the Constitution.

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.020
We have to go to a quick commercial break.

01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.020
It's the Alex Jones show.

01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:35.020
We'll be right back.

01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:38.820
So now it's up to Pence to save the Constitution, which I guess he didn't do.

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:39.820
Oh, no.

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:41.740
So the audience kind of took the message.

01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:42.740
Yeah.

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:45.860
Seemed very one to one.

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:46.860
Seemed very if-then.

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:52.100
It's, again, narrative consistency.

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:56.780
It's kind of interesting how the night before, Owen was trying out a little bit of standup.

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:57.780
Yeah, he was doing a bit.

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.780
Yeah.

01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:01.220
And I noticed that Trump might have the standup itch too.

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:02.220
He's got a bit.

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:03.220
He's got a little bit.

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:04.220
All right.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:09.420
And the only unhappy person in the United States, single most unhappy, is Hillary Clinton

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:13.380
because she said, why didn't you do this for me four years ago?

01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:16.660
Why didn't you do this for me four years ago?

01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:20.220
You changed the votes, 10,000 in Michigan.

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:23.740
You could have changed the whole thing, but she's not too happy.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.580
You don't see her anymore.

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:26.580
What happened?

01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:27.580
Where's Hillary?

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:28.580
Where is she?

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:29.580
That bit did not land.

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:32.940
You would have expected that bit to go over gangbusters in that crowd, but no.

01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:39.020
I think the problem with that bit is that he unfortunately undid his entire bullshit

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:40.860
for this election.

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.220
Yeah.

01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:43.820
Why didn't they do it for her?

01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:44.820
Yeah.

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:47.700
It's a comedic premise as much as it is a plot hole.

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:48.700
Yeah.

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:49.700
Exactly.

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:50.700
Yeah.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:51.700
Yeah.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:52.700
Huh.

01:12:52.700 --> 01:13:03.700
Oh, why didn't those gunners on the destroyer shoot down the escape pod with C-3PO and R2D2

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:04.700
on it?

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:05.700
Good bit.

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:06.700
I don't know.

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:07.700
I don't know.

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:08.700
Hilarious.

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:09.700
Hilarious.

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:12.380
So this is where things fall apart.

01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:17.100
He wants to try and prove that there was fraud.

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.100
Sure.

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:19.100
Let's hear it.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:20.100
It was rough.

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:21.100
Okay.

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:24.980
As you know, the media has constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was no evidence

01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:25.980
of widespread fraud.

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:26.980
You ever see these people?

01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:27.980
You ever see these people?

01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:28.980
Well, there's no evidence of fraud.

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:29.980
Oh, really?

01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:31.980
Well, I'm going to read you pages.

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:34.300
I hope you don't get bored listening to it.

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:35.300
Promise.

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.500
Don't get bored listening to it.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:40.780
All those hundreds of thousands of people back there.

01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.340
Move them up, please.

01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:45.660
All these people, don't get bored.

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:48.580
Don't get angry at me because you're going to get bored.

01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:49.860
Because it's so much.

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.860
They do get bored.

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:51.860
Yeah.

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:52.860
He just starts rattling off numbers.

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:53.860
That'll happen.

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:54.860
And stuff.

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.140
And the audience, I don't think, is able to pay attention.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.340
It's not exciting.

01:13:57.340 --> 01:14:00.060
He loses them a little bit.

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:07.160
In retrospect, if all of these speakers had known that the crowd was more of a stormin'

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.100
crowd than a chantin' crowd, you know?

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.820
Like they like chantin' for sure.

01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:12.820
But they love stormin'.

01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:13.820
Well, we learned that.

01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:17.540
I don't think the numbers game was really going to inspire them in the speeches department.

01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:19.780
You kind of needed like a three quarters Alex.

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:20.780
Yeah, totally.

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:21.780
That's about where you want him to be.

01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:22.780
Yeah.

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:24.140
You'll burn out too fast with a full Alex.

01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:25.140
Totally.

01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:27.780
But that same kind of energy, just a little bit lower.

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:30.540
And if you get stuck in the weeds, you're not coming back out.

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:31.540
No.

01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:32.540
Nope.

01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:33.540
Start talking about COVID shit.

01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:34.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:35.540
You're fucked.

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:36.540
One out of every ten people.

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:37.540
We already stopped listening, buddy.

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:38.540
Start listing off counties.

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:39.540
Yeah, exactly.

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:40.540
Oh, yeah, don't.

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.540
Get the fuck out of here.

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:45.540
The only way to save that is you got to start complaining about Twitter.

01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:51.180
Every time I put out a tweet, even if it's totally correct, totally correct, I get a

01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:52.180
flag.

01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.180
It gets flagged.

01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:54.180
I get a flag.

01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:56.500
And they also don't let you get out.

01:14:56.500 --> 01:15:00.160
You know, on Twitter, it's very hard to come onto my account.

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.620
It's very hard to get out a message.

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:06.180
They don't let the message get out nearly like they should.

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:09.060
But I've had many people say, I can't get on your Twitter.

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:10.580
I don't care about Twitter.

01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:11.580
Twitter's bad news.

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:13.180
They're all bad news.

01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:14.300
Twitter's bad news.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.860
Twitter's bad news.

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:17.460
Oh, man.

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:22.620
How funny is it how long everybody has tried to respect the office of the president?

01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:23.620
Yeah.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:25.300
How hilarious is it?

01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:30.040
This might have all ended if TV news anchors just treated Trump the way I did.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:34.200
And every time he whined, just went, oh, no, you're so sad.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.820
And then everybody was done.

01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:36.820
Maybe.

01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:37.820
Yeah.

01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:42.580
I mean, look, I know that generally we don't cover when, you know, Trump's speeches.

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:46.460
But often they don't play these full speeches on Info Wars.

01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:47.460
Of course not.

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:51.740
And I had to listen to this.

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:52.740
I'm sorry.

01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:53.740
So that's why we're...

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.220
That's why I have to listen.

01:15:56.220 --> 01:16:00.460
And because there are things in it that are like, really, if you're listening in the audience,

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:04.980
you kind of get a certain message, and that is that Pence has got to seize power.

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:05.980
That's our only option.

01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:06.980
Yeah, 100%.

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:09.700
And it's time that somebody did something about it.

01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:15.460
And Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for

01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:17.680
the good of our country.

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:23.300
And if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you, I will tell you right now.

01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:24.860
I'm not hearing good stories.

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.940
He's not hearing good stories.

01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:30.000
So I mean, that's pretty clear, but it's even clearer here.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.700
The Republicans have to get tougher.

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:34.960
You're not going to have a Republican Party if you don't get tougher.

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:37.460
They want to play so straight, they want to play so...

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:39.580
Sir, yes, the United States.

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:43.420
The Constitution doesn't allow me to send them back to the States.

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:45.420
Well, I say, yes, it does.

01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:49.060
Because the Constitution says you have to protect our country, and you have to protect

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:52.460
our Constitution, and you can't vote on fraud.

01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:54.800
And fraud breaks up everything, doesn't it?

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:59.500
When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very different rules.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.500
I should know.

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:01.500
I've cheated on my wife.

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:05.100
And I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do.

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:09.220
And I hope he doesn't listen to the rhinos and the stupid people that he's listening

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:10.220
to.

01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:14.740
You know, whenever you have the president up there saying that Pence is the last chance

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:19.940
to really save this and save the Constitution, he has a responsibility to do it, then Pence

01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:22.000
doesn't do that thing.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.840
And the president has also said that when something is stolen, you're playing by a different

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.160
set of rules.

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:32.780
It's kind of hard to not take away a message of, like, there's no rules.

01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:35.620
The rules that are normal are gone.

01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:42.060
I do find it difficult to take a would-be strongman dictator seriously if he gives an

01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:45.660
entire speech exhorting his second in command.

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:51.780
What is a borderline honorary position?

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:54.300
It's to overthrow the country for him.

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:55.580
That's a little bit sad.

01:17:55.580 --> 01:18:00.020
Mixed in with petty complaints about people being rude to him.

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:01.020
Real tough.

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:02.020
And Twitter traction.

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:04.140
Real tough to be terrified of this.

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:08.060
But that's kind of the thing, though.

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:13.140
That could easily be what blinds you to the real danger of a lot of things.

01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:19.700
And it's easy to minimize what some real threats are because of that window dressing of, like,

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:20.700
isn't this pathetic?

01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:21.700
Yeah, sure.

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:22.700
And shit.

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:23.700
Obviously.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:24.700
Of course.

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.820
So, we're done with Trump's speech now.

01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:31.620
That was the most of it that is relevant, because Harrison comes back and he wants to

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:36.900
throw it to a video of what's going on in Congress, where Mike Pence is presiding over

01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:37.900
this.

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:42.700
But they actually send it to the streets, where Alex is bullhorning.

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:47.340
Let's go to inside the chamber here.

01:18:47.340 --> 01:19:03.540
The report is...

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.160
So what does that mean?

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.020
It doesn't have a good rhythm.

01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:08.020
It doesn't have a good meter.

01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.020
No, it doesn't.

01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:10.340
As far as the chant goes.

01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:13.100
But also, again, he's chanting 1776.

01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:17.460
I don't know what message you're supposed to take away from that other than overthrow

01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:18.460
the government.

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:20.620
What happened in 1776 that he would be referencing?

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:23.180
I mean, there's that revolution...

01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.700
Did anything else happen, though?

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:25.700
I mean, I'm certain.

01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:29.660
I'm certain there were things that history has not recorded that happened.

01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:30.660
Let's see.

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:31.660
Did, uh...

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:32.660
Probably someone opened a business.

01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:38.180
Yeah, I would say that I think Benjamin Franklin opened up a little side gig grinding lenses.

01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:40.700
I think that's also what happened in 1776.

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:46.980
I guarantee there was somebody in, like, Virginia who was also like, everybody cool out!

01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:48.540
He's not referencing that.

01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:49.540
1776!

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:54.060
The year Sam made his first beers!

01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.300
Sam Adams!

01:19:55.300 --> 01:20:00.940
Somebody in Virginia was trying to get people to have rationality, and calmer heads will

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:01.940
prevail!

01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:02.940
Yeah!

01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:03.940
That's not what he's referring to.

01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:05.180
He's talking about overthrowing the government.

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:08.840
I think a diplomatic solution is in order!

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:14.460
So Alex still is not, like, great with long stretches, he'll still end up becoming really

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:15.460
overwhelmed by...

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:16.460
I mean, it's tough.

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:17.460
You gotta yell into a bullhorn.

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:18.460
Bullhorning is hard.

01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:20.460
So Owen's gotta come in here and there.

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:21.460
Sure.

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:28.460
The Democrats have gone so insane that they're now making the words mother and father illegal

01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:29.460
in legislative bodies!

01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:30.460
Have you heard this?

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:31.460
Nancy Pelosi has proposed that the words mother and father are illegal.

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:32.460
So I got news for Nancy Pelosi!

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:43.100
Donald Trump is your daddy!

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:44.100
Too good.

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.100
Do twice.

01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:46.100
Oh boy.

01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:47.100
Yeah.

01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.100
He's into that bit.

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.100
Oh man.

01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:50.100
Yup.

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:54.540
So when I was listening to this action of Alex and Owen on the street, it really felt

01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:57.460
like they were trying to juice this crowd up.

01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:59.700
It feels kind of like incitement.

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:06.940
Ladies and gentlemen, Trump said in his speech today, he said the Democrats are out to get

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:07.940
us.

01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:08.940
They want to destroy us!

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:09.940
They want for the globalist!

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:10.940
They want to bring America down!

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:11.940
But we're not going to let them do it!

01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:12.940
This news system is a military high-tech attack, and we need to understand we're under attack,

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:13.940
and we need to understand this is 21st century warfare, and get on the road.

01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:14.940
We need to get on the road.

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:15.940
We need to get on the road.

01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:16.940
We need to get on the road.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:17.940
We need to get on the road.

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:37.100
And not just take this country back, but take the whole world back from the communist Chinese!

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:41.420
So I mean, it seems like if you're in the audience, you're probably, this is the kind

01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:47.580
of thing that would be like, what you then yell, rawr, and then you charge, you know?

01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:51.540
How should I take the country back?

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:53.180
You're not giving me answers.

01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:55.300
I'm not getting concrete answers from you.

01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:56.300
Supplements.

01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:00.980
There's actually a way to take the country back in front of me, so I'm going to go do

01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:01.980
that.

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:02.980
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:03.980
You need to spread my links.

01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:04.980
No, no, no, no.

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:06.660
See, you said take the country back.

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:08.860
Right, by spreading links to Band.video and buying supplements.

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:10.980
I left my phone in the car.

01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:13.140
I guess I'll overthrow the government.

01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:14.140
Just take a walk.

01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:17.620
When you get back to the car, you'll be able to, just be cool.

01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:20.260
But I want one of those pictures off that fucking wall, man.

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:21.260
Listen to me.

01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:22.260
Listen to me.

01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:24.060
I went on a tour the other day, and there's this picture.

01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.180
No, it's on the Capitol building wall.

01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:30.100
Stopping the Chinese can only be achieved by more traffic coming to my website.

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:32.100
I don't think you understand.

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:35.900
We're at cross purposes!

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:39.980
We have different ideas of what 1776 looks like.

01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:43.740
In your 1776, you get rich!

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:46.140
I feel like that's different than mine!

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:49.180
You're trying to profiteer.

01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:51.900
So Owen, I'm sorry, not Owen.

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:58.540
Harrison has been pretty clear that allegedly, alleged, Donald Trump has personally asked

01:22:58.540 --> 01:22:59.780
Alex to lead this march.

01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:00.780
It's possible.

01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:07.140
Now that's weird because while they're showing Alex, you can overhear a producer tell Alex

01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:12.540
that Trump told the audience at his speech that they were going to march down Pennsylvania,

01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:15.180
which Alex should know, because he's supposed to be leading that march.

01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:16.180
He was led, yeah.

01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:17.180
President's going to finish.

01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:22.620
President's going to finish in ten minutes, and he just told the crowd, let's walk down

01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:23.620
Pennsylvania.

01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:24.620
Is this Pennsylvania?

01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:27.480
Right, folks, this is a live feed from Washington, D.C.

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:31.580
Right now, Alex Jones and Owen Schroer speaking to a large crowd.

01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:37.180
That exchange doesn't make much sense if Trump has asked Alex to, but whatever.

01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:38.180
I don't care.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:41.020
Trump is going down Pennsylvania Avenue.

01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:42.020
Where am I?

01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:43.020
Is this Pennsylvania?

01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:44.020
Am I in D.C.?

01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.020
Where am I?

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:46.020
Pennsylvania's a state.

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:51.300
That's a long walk from here.

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:55.700
So here is where we get our first mention of the breaching of barriers.

01:23:55.700 --> 01:24:00.060
And I think it's really interesting because these people have started to encroach over

01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:07.440
the line, and at the same time, you have audio of Alex yelling about the New World Order.

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.320
On the broadcast that Harrison is trying to put together, you have really an interesting

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:15.260
juxtaposition of these two things.

01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:17.780
Mike Pence has rejected Trump's call.

01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:23.820
He has failed to show the courage that Donald Trump was attempting to imbue in him and has

01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:27.060
begun the counting of the electoral votes.

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:34.940
At the same time, there's word that thousands of patriots have broken through the barriers

01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:39.580
around the Capitol and are now moving towards it to occupy this word from Elijah Shaffer,

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:41.260
who's on the ground.

01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:43.620
And Alex Jones continues to speak to this crowd.

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.620
Let's go back to Alex Jones.

01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:54.380
And the great awakening, the great reset is triggering the great awakening and the great

01:24:54.380 --> 01:25:02.860
awakening will trigger the great rebellion and the destruction of the New World Order.

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:04.940
Looks bad in hindsight.

01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:06.580
A lot of this looks real bad.

01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:10.820
I just, I'm starting to see a pattern.

01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:13.100
The word, it's thematic consistency.

01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:19.260
Yeah, you know, a lot of the times I think the word incitement is overused.

01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:22.020
You know, it's a very specific meaning.

01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:23.940
This is that specific meaning.

01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:31.340
Yeah, it's interesting because this group does, like that Alex is leading, are not the

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:36.820
same people that Harrison is talking about breaching these barriers.

01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:41.140
But at the same time, Alex's group is going to go to the Capitol.

01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:42.740
They're heading to the Capitol.

01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:46.700
So some of the people that are in Alex's group may have gotten involved.

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:47.700
We'll have to.

01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:51.980
I don't know, but I mean, they would hope for the time being, these are two separate

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:56.640
things that are happening are a hundred percent in sync.

01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:01.220
And to the extent that like a lot of those people who are the first ones that were pictured

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:06.340
inside the Capitol building were QAnon weirdos, Alex is talking about the Great Awakening,

01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:11.540
which is such a trademark of the Q followers.

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:16.060
Something that is basically their brand.

01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:17.960
And it's just, it's a lot.

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.100
It's a lot.

01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:27.060
But I will say, in Alex's credit, maybe not in Alex's credit, he's very insistent to make

01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:31.460
sure people hear him say we're not politically nonviolent, nonviolent.

01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:32.460
Yeah.

01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:38.420
Upwards of, as we say, estimated a million people moving to surround the Capitol.

01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:42.700
Owen Troyer and Alex Jones now speaking through the bullhorn to the crowds who follow them.

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:43.700
You stabbed us in the back one too many times.

01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:44.700
Coming with truth and justice and non-violent civil disobedience.

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:46.700
Good to get that on the record.

01:26:46.700 --> 01:27:04.500
No, there's, I think just after that you can hear someone say, you tell them Alex.

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:08.820
I think a producer also was in his ear there saying, hey, they were, they're actually doing

01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:09.820
it.

01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:14.940
So, uh, I don't know how much Alex would be aware of at this point because you know, communication

01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:19.380
would be difficult with that many people in a, such a tight space.

01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:20.380
Totally.

01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:21.380
Communication could be tough.

01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:25.020
I know that Alex does have quite a security detail that probably have walkie talkies and

01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:26.020
private bands.

01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:27.020
Yeah.

01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:31.820
So there is a chance that, and actually spoiler alert, I know that he has somebody who's inside.

01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:32.820
Yeah.

01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:38.580
So like, I know that like he, I have a hard time believing he doesn't know more than it

01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:39.580
appears.

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:40.580
Sure.

01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:41.780
But also I don't know if he knows the full scope of things.

01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:42.780
Right.

01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:43.780
Right.

01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:44.780
Right.

01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:47.180
I think it would be strange that he would be very insistent on being like, we're coming

01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:48.180
with nonviolent.

01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:49.180
All right.

01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:50.180
Yeah.

01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.180
That seems a little bit telling.

01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:52.180
But it also seems on brand for him.

01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:56.780
I could believe like, cause he'd always says like politically, I want to kill you politically.

01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:57.780
Yeah.

01:27:57.780 --> 01:27:58.780
Yeah.

01:27:58.780 --> 01:27:59.780
So it's hard to say.

01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:04.740
Uh, they also, uh, you know, just getting people riled up while they walk.

01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:05.740
It's fun.

01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:06.740
We're never surrendering!

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:07.740
Until tomorrow.

01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:08.740
This is our country!

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:09.740
This is our country!

01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:10.740
Not our corrupt politician's country!

01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:19.740
They work for us and it's time they got our family to remind us who their boss is!

01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:27.740
The communist Chinese and the globalist and Hollywood don't run this country and our children

01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:30.740
do not belong in their pedophile trash!

01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:37.740
We will not accept the fake election of that child molesting Joe Biden, that Chinese communist

01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:38.740
agent Joe Biden!

01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:42.260
We know where he belongs and it's not the White House!

01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:46.380
So something I think is really interesting about their dynamic, their tag team dynamic,

01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:51.380
is like, they kind of have to do this because Alex doesn't have the cardio to walk and carry

01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:57.280
on sentences and simultaneously Owen doesn't have the creativity to speak more than like

01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:58.280
in little bursts.

01:28:58.280 --> 01:28:59.280
Yeah.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.280
Yeah.

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:01.280
Yeah.

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.280
So the two of them kind of need each other as crutches.

01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.280
Yeah.

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:04.280
They're doing a good little two man game here.

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.280
I think of it as like a three legged race.

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.280
Yeah.

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:11.700
Well, it's no Siskel and Ebert teamwork level of complimentary parts here.

01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:12.700
No.

01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:16.020
Or some like good trading verses and some hip hop songs you might hear.

01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:17.020
It's not that.

01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:18.020
It's not fluid.

01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:19.020
This is not definition.

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:20.020
No.

01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:23.780
No, no Mos Def and Talib Kweli to be found here.

01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:28.940
No, but it's the same thing in terms of like they need each other in order to make this

01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:29.940
work.

01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:30.940
Yeah.

01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:31.940
It's blah.

01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:32.940
Sad.

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:36.100
So Harrison's back in the studio and he has some other things to report, primarily he's

01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:41.700
getting word that staffers are evacuating from these Capitol buildings.

01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:46.180
Siskel is addressing the house right now, but here is an update as of less than a minute

01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:50.820
ago Hill staffers have been told to evacuate the Madison building.

01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:55.340
Things are getting tenuous here as Trump supporters and Patriots continue to pour towards

01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:56.340
the Capitol.

01:29:56.340 --> 01:30:00.860
Alex Jones himself at the head of a massive column of Patriots moving now towards the

01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:03.060
United States Capitol building.

01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:08.220
This again looks bad.

01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:12.860
The government is fleeing Alex Jones is at the head of the rebellion.

01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:17.900
Well, they're going to enjoin the rebellion that is already in progress.

01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:21.900
They're the reinforcement column that's coming in.

01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:25.420
Alex Jones is flanking the fucking Capitol building.

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:30.800
And to a certain extent, I kind of think that the reason that it's being presented like

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:33.460
this is they still think this is going to stop.

01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:34.460
Yeah, no, of course.

01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:37.820
They still think they're not going to get inside.

01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:40.180
Everybody thinks that someone will stop these people.

01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:41.180
Yeah.

01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:42.180
Yeah.

01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:47.180
But because there's still this like, eh, kind of vibe, this is all very positive.

01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:53.740
This is a historic day, ladies and gentlemen, incredible things happening there storming

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:58.300
DC Patriots are rushing and surrounding the Capitol.

01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:00.060
They're tearing down barriers.

01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:06.020
Police are struggling to maintain the crowd mace and punches being thrown back and forth

01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:09.920
to two house buildings have been evacuated.

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:14.700
The House Cannon building in the House Madison building have both been issued evacuation

01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:15.700
orders.

01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:21.540
Pence has said he cannot reject out electoral votes outright, but the Congress themselves

01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:25.100
are objecting right now to the Arizona votes.

01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:26.340
The vibe is really positive.

01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:31.060
You know, this is, this is someone who's like really pumped to see what's happening.

01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:32.420
Yeah, this is great.

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:33.780
This will never go wrong.

01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:34.780
Yeah.

01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:37.960
And I know that now there are a lot of people who are trying to make arguments that this

01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:38.960
was Antifa.

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:39.960
Uh, certainly.

01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:42.660
Oh, it was just so super Antifa.

01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:43.660
Yeah.

01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:49.220
There's a lot of folks who have been on that tip, but immediately as everything is unfolding,

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:52.640
Harrison wants you to know that this is not, these are the Patriots.

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.020
This is not black lives matter folks.

01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:55.460
This is not Antifa.

01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:59.580
These are Patriots and perhaps they finally boiled over.

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:06.500
You see the air filled with the mist of mace, the stinging gas that the police will be implementing

01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:10.420
and that is also being implemented against the police as Patriots.

01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:11.420
Wow.

01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:15.920
So, I mean, he's being very clear that, and if you watch the video, there are people who

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:18.740
are macing cops, which is, you know, that's violence.

01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:19.740
Yeah.

01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:20.740
So yeah.

01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:21.740
Check that just for later.

01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:22.740
Totally.

01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:23.740
Um, yeah, he's very clear.

01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:24.740
This is not, this is us.

01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:25.740
This is our guys.

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:26.740
We take responsibility.

01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:30.180
They finally had enough.

01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:31.180
He's celebrating all that.

01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:32.180
Of course he is.

01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:33.180
There's a celebratory vibe.

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:34.180
Of course it is.

01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:40.660
American nationalists on Twitter, uh, asking president Trump to storm the Senate chamber.

01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:46.060
This day is young folks and who knows what will be, uh, what the, what the future holds

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.060
for us.

01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:50.500
Again, Elijah Shaffer reports Patriots have stormed the Capitol building ground and are

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:53.180
breaching federal barriers and police en masse.

01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:54.180
Yeah.

01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:55.180
That's what this day will bring.

01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:56.580
Maybe exactly what you're talking about.

01:32:56.580 --> 01:33:01.060
Could be exactly what you're saying is what you want to happen might happen.

01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:02.060
Yeah.

01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:05.100
And he's pretty consistently calling these people Patriots.

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.100
Sure.

01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:09.740
Thousands, hundreds of thousands of people right now moving towards the Capitol.

01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:15.740
The mass of humanity continues to grow as the police lash out their thin line of armored

01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:22.280
officers, a pitiful resistance against the literal tidal wave moving towards them.

01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:25.100
There's a pitiful resistance against these Patriots.

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:26.100
They're so strong.

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.100
Now.

01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:28.100
Yes.

01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:31.180
This is Harrison reporting on what he's seeing, right?

01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:34.020
Because he has access to a lot of different information.

01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:35.020
Yeah.

01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:36.020
Yeah.

01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:37.020
Yeah.

01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:38.020
Alex may or may not.

01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:42.820
So now we go to Alex on the street where everyone is chanting, fight for Trump.

01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:43.820
Cool.

01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:55.220
Chance of fight for Trump surrounding Alex Jones and Owen Troyer and the rest of the

01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:59.660
info Wars crew as they move towards the Capitol here, we see a view from inside the Capitol

01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:00.660
of staffers.

01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:04.420
They're moving down the stairs, following that evacuation order.

01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:09.180
You can't not see this as like two things that are about to intersect.

01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:10.180
Sure.

01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:13.940
A group of people who are fighting for Trump and a group of people that are being led by

01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:16.940
Alex who are chanting, fight for Trump.

01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:17.940
Right.

01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:18.940
Seems to be.

01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:19.940
Yes.

01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:20.940
Yes.

01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:21.940
Yeah.

01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:22.940
Yeah.

01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:23.940
Yeah.

01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:24.940
It's weird.

01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:25.940
It's very weird.

01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:26.940
Yeah.

01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:27.940
I would.

01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:28.940
Thematic consistency.

01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:29.940
I would want this back.

01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:30.940
Mulligan.

01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:33.860
I would like a mulligan on today.

01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:35.300
I don't think they can get that.

01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:40.140
This show looks bad.

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:43.980
It's one part because Harrison Smith is hosting and he's terrible, but another part because

01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:48.820
like, I mean, you could draw your own conclusions.

01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:54.980
I don't, I don't think that like it would be wise or even sensible to say that like

01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:59.620
Alex inspired a lot of these actions because I mean, like we already said, a lot of the

01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:03.820
people who are the first photographed folks who were there, who had gotten in were Q folks

01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:05.180
and they hate Alex.

01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:09.220
It's easy to, if you don't have an awareness of those worlds to think like, Oh, it's all

01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:10.220
the same.

01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:11.220
Right.

01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:12.220
It is not.

01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:13.220
Those people do not listen to Alex.

01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:14.220
Right.

01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:17.240
There are similar information spheres in terms of a lot of the themes and the narratives

01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:21.740
and the stories that they tell and the reality that they believe in, but they are not the

01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:23.180
same group.

01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:29.700
Now at the same time, Past Info Wars guests like Nick Fuentes and Baked Alaska were both

01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:36.140
in the offices, live streaming, and that's a little bit fucked up.

01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:37.140
They're Antifa.

01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:38.140
Did you know that?

01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:44.100
They are deep state secret Antifa agents that this entire time have been inspired.

01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:48.780
Not just, see the problem was they wanted deep state Antifa agents to inspire right

01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:49.780
wing violence.

01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:50.780
Sure.

01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:51.780
Right?

01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:52.780
But there wasn't any right wing violence, Dan.

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:53.780
Oh, I see.

01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:56.860
They would never existed, so they had to create it from the ground up.

01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:58.060
I've got a conspiracy for you.

01:35:58.060 --> 01:35:59.060
What's that?

01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:00.060
Where do you live?

01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:01.060
I live down the way.

01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:02.060
What city?

01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:03.060
Chicago.

01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:04.060
What city is Nick Fuentes living?

01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:05.060
Chicago?

01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:06.060
Uh oh.

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:07.060
No way.

01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:08.060
You're Nick Fuentes.

01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:09.060
Stop yelling.

01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:10.060
Stop yelling.

01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:11.060
Sorry.

01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:12.060
That's alright.

01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:13.060
That deserved a yell.

01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:14.060
Okay.

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:18.940
So this all just looks, it all looks really, really bad.

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:25.340
And especially thinking about the people who are, you know, it's sometimes tough for people

01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:30.620
to get over their frustration with elected officials and feel too much empathy for them.

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:34.860
But then you think about people who are just staffers and people who are just on the job

01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:38.100
and the terror that a lot of them probably felt.

01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:45.140
Being whisked away to secure locations, I can't even imagine what that would be like.

01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:49.860
And it's really fucked up to know that that is what a lot of people are experiencing.

01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:53.980
And for this just to be like, they're kind of relishing it.

01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:56.700
And Harrison is as well on air.

01:36:56.700 --> 01:37:04.620
Now in the least unexpected thing ever, Trump is not going to the Capitol.

01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:09.260
After he said, we're all going to the Capitol, they're all going to the Capitol, huge, almost

01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:14.340
unprecedented crowd is moving towards the Capitol.

01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:19.420
As we speak, as the debate rages inside, President Trump has apparently returned to the White

01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:20.420
House.

01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:22.580
That's the word that we're receiving from Washington.

01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:25.820
He said he was going to go to the Capitol, but it looks like he's gone to the White House

01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:26.820
instead.

01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:31.780
Many people on Twitter encouraging him to storm the Senate along with his supporters.

01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:37.460
And what we're seeing here are the independent journalist videos as the Trump supporters

01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:41.300
move once again inexorably towards the Capitol building.

01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:45.460
Yeah, I wonder why he would send everybody towards the Capitol and then not go there

01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:46.460
himself.

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:47.460
That seems crazy.

01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:52.160
That just seems crazy because he's their fearless leader, you know, he's the one at the, no,

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.380
they're willing to die for this man because he's willing to die for them.

01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:57.380
Yeah.

01:37:57.380 --> 01:38:01.520
This dude is a fucking potster.

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:08.820
So you remember that ragtime music that was playing earlier and the joyous, the joyous

01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:12.260
tone square that Rob do was describing.

01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:13.260
Yeah.

01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:14.260
Yeah.

01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:15.260
That vibe has changed.

01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:16.260
Oh, it's changed.

01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:17.260
Oh, no more flappers dancing.

01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:18.260
Nope.

01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:27.220
The joyous, uh, you know, uh, uh, upbeat atmosphere of the event earlier today has soured and

01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:33.660
turned to rage as the fury of Trump supporters and Patriots crossing United States overflows

01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:37.340
and expresses itself on the outside of the Capitol.

01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:43.100
So the, the, the editorial tone, it appears to me to be pretty consistently righteous

01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:44.100
indignation.

01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:45.100
Yeah.

01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:48.140
That is what is motivating this and they are right to do this.

01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:51.820
They are right to storm the Capitol and Trump should be right there with them.

01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:53.700
Are you saying that the founding fathers were wrong?

01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:56.120
Mike Pence wouldn't stop this.

01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:00.420
So someone's got to, or else the constitution has been pissed upon Mike.

01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:01.800
Mike Pence is King George.

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:03.740
We got to take them out.

01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:08.180
So the vibe is just excitement kind of about this because there's nothing Harrison can

01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:11.060
really do other than be the guy who's calling it.

01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:14.260
I'm the guy who gets to be on air while this is going on.

01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:15.260
Yeah.

01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:20.800
And again, this was as of 24 minutes ago and since then we've seen 24 minutes of rising

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:27.740
aggression, rising crowds, more police building evacuations.

01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:34.980
And the reaction from across the nation is largely excitement as far as I'm concerned.

01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:40.940
This is again, truly incredible and we'll continue to update and bring you more videos.

01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:41.940
The vibe is excitement.

01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:42.940
Yeah.

01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:44.500
It was not the vibe that I was getting.

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:49.800
I took a, I took a slightly different temperature from the country based on the sense I was

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:56.620
getting, um, yeah, I, it seemed like everybody, uh, soured real quick.

01:39:56.620 --> 01:40:02.740
Everybody was like, Oh, this is, Oh no, Oh no, that's not, Oh no, I didn't want that.

01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:12.660
I saw a lot of people responding in ways that, um, were kind of like, Oh, Oh my, like, uh,

01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:17.180
I can't believe I didn't see this possibility coming.

01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:21.900
And I think it's a little, which is very funny from, uh, from where I I'm sitting.

01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:22.900
Sure.

01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:28.460
But I mean, at the same time, I think that had this not have happened this week, yeah,

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:32.100
you and I would have had a show where we would have said, ah, another dumb rally.

01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:34.180
What do you, what do you expect is going to happen?

01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:39.140
It's more just edging towards the hope that something like this would happen.

01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:41.340
I'm not surprised that it did, but I'm shocked.

01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:42.620
You know that, that, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:45.540
I think that there's a lot of people who are surprised.

01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:50.460
And I see a lot of like scales falling from people's eyes and it would be easy to respond

01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:55.140
to that with some kind of like a flippant, like I told you so, or, you know, like I get

01:40:55.140 --> 01:41:00.220
on our, I, I, I'm glad that I haven't seen a lot of that because I think that that's

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:01.220
really counterproductive.

01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:02.220
Yeah, totally.

01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:07.540
And I hope that people who, I mean, I did tell you so though, you want to engage in

01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:08.540
that.

01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:09.540
That's your business.

01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:10.540
But I was facetious.

01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:11.540
I know.

01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:12.540
I know.

01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:13.540
Come on.

01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:18.020
There's a white right wing extremist storming the white house and they're like, oh, this

01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:21.460
is what people have been talking about for a while.

01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:22.820
That is fucked up.

01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:23.820
All right.

01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:24.820
Okay.

01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:25.820
Great.

01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:30.140
No need to shame anybody as long as they remember that this is a problem.

01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:31.140
Yeah.

01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:32.140
Tomorrow too.

01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:33.140
Yes.

01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:34.140
It didn't stop yesterday.

01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:35.140
No.

01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:37.780
And it doesn't, and today, I mean, spoiler alert, we don't know what Alex's response

01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:42.200
is to it, but Trump has basically been like, all right, whatever, it's over.

01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:44.260
It reminded me, and that doesn't end it.

01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:45.260
Yeah.

01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:46.260
No, no, no, no, no.

01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:47.260
That does not end the problem.

01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:51.340
The reaction to it reminded me so much of, uh, my partner was watching a documentary

01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:56.300
the other day and they, some, one of the bad guys, it was like a crime documentary about

01:41:56.300 --> 01:42:00.900
a small town that had gotten rogue with the police department and the Sheriff's department.

01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:03.100
And she was like, can you believe this?

01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:07.760
This guy thinks that the Sheriff is the highest constitutional power in the land.

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:11.080
And I was like, well, baby, you ain't got no idea.

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:13.900
Let me tell you about, uh, one sixth of the country.

01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:14.900
Yeah.

01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:15.900
And that's, that's what I'm saying.

01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:20.980
Like all these people watch this and I'm like, and it's the same reaction of, of like, I,

01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:24.180
I know you thought that that couldn't be real.

01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:25.180
Yeah.

01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:26.180
Oh, but it is.

01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:27.180
One sixth of the country is too high.

01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:31.860
I was, I was, I was desperately grasping for a number and that's what came to my head.

01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:33.740
This is why Trump can't do rallies anymore.

01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:34.740
Too many numbers.

01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:40.740
Um, so, but it comes down to, for Harrison though, again, is just righteous indignation.

01:42:40.740 --> 01:42:42.480
That is the name of the game.

01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:48.940
We do know is that the Washington establishment is scrambling any and all officers they have

01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:55.180
at their command in order to deal with this massive outpouring of anger, fury, and righteous

01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:59.220
indignation coming from the Trump supporters.

01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:05.260
You can there see, we have the Fox News feed up and even they are having trouble maintaining

01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:07.860
the integrity of their signal.

01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:09.740
So yeah, it's just righteous indignation.

01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:14.820
These people have been pushed to the point where this, this response is the only, only

01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:16.280
thing that can be done.

01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:21.460
You have created an imaginary reality wherein I have pushed, been pushed too far.

01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:22.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:26.060
So there's rallies going on in other states as well.

01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:29.740
There's some fucked up stuff happening elsewhere.

01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:34.260
Harrison covers this and then says something pretty scary.

01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:37.900
Los Angeles as well, a stop the steal rally lining the streets.

01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:44.820
Hundreds of Trump supporters, people cheering it on on Twitter saying, drag them out, saying

01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:48.540
go into the Capitol building and drag the traitors out.

01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:53.300
That does not seem like something that could have been impossible.

01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:54.300
No.

01:43:54.300 --> 01:44:01.380
Had things gone slightly differently, I could see some harm coming to representatives and

01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:02.380
Congress members.

01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:04.260
No, there were people walking around with zip ties.

01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:05.420
I saw those pictures.

01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:11.620
I didn't have a chance to look into them enough to feel really confident, but that was really

01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:12.620
scary.

01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:13.620
Yeah.

01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:19.220
The people who tweeted them out, I trust enough to be like, I have to go search down every,

01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:20.220
you know?

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:21.220
No, totally.

01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:28.300
I just, for my standpoint, I didn't want to, I didn't, I can't, I can't back that a hundred

01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:33.740
percent of my own looking into it, but I don't think it's fake.

01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:35.460
I just don't know enough.

01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:37.900
But that's scary as hell.

01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:45.460
Even the possibility that that is what someone was up to going to take hostages or some shit.

01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:48.780
Put a citizen's arrest on Chuck Schumer or something.

01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:49.780
Like it's terrifying.

01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:50.780
Wow.

01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:53.460
I guess we have slightly different takes.

01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:55.060
No, I understand.

01:44:55.060 --> 01:44:58.460
It is terrifying, but it is also deeply funny.

01:44:58.460 --> 01:44:59.680
That's the problem.

01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:05.780
That's where I'm, I'm struggling with this because we are looking at a group of people

01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:12.260
who stormed the fucking Capitol building, but we are also looking at a series of pictures

01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:16.260
of people smoking weed in Nancy Pelosi's office.

01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:18.860
So that's deeply funny.

01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:19.860
Sorry.

01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:23.580
So Harrison is going on and I just can't hear this as anything other than just like, this

01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:26.360
is really positive coverage.

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:31.700
There are people such as a Dana lash saying, stop this to Trump supporters who are moving

01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:33.080
towards the Capitol.

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:35.340
Other people saying, get in there and tear them out.

01:45:35.340 --> 01:45:39.140
Oh, here we see my God, these images are just incredible.

01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:44.140
Massive numbers of Patriots storming the Capitol building, Texas flags waving American flags

01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:49.520
waving and masses of humanity have apparently broken past the police barricades, which were

01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:52.380
keeping them off the steps and away from the Capitol building.

01:45:52.380 --> 01:46:00.460
They have been torn down and the people have moved onto that raised platform and are scaling

01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:03.120
the scaffolding that was set up.

01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:09.900
So at this point, you know, we don't have people inside, but you do have an awareness

01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:15.660
that there are people who are a large mass of folks who are not seeming to have all that

01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:22.100
much resistance from the authorities who are making their way towards the Capitol building.

01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:26.800
You have people online who are expressing a desire for people to be dragged out.

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:30.960
You have people who want Trump to come and lead a charge on the Senate.

01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:33.580
So you have that awareness.

01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:40.260
And when you have that in the, in the sort of context of what's going on, you hear a

01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:44.120
clip like this and you're like, you just want somebody to kill.

01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:47.220
You just want, you want somebody to kill someone you don't like.

01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:48.220
Incredible.

01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:51.980
And the crowd continues to swell.

01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:52.980
What was it?

01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:54.780
I mean, I've lost track of time.

01:46:54.780 --> 01:47:01.500
I think it was less than an hour ago, an hour ago that President Trump finished his speech

01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:06.220
and that massive crowd of hundreds of thousands, probably upwards of a million people surrounding

01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:11.660
the Washington monuments and all the way to the White House finished watching that speech

01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:14.660
by President Trump and moved towards the U.S. Capitol.

01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:20.620
And by the time that, uh, here we see an update from Ilhan Omar, currency in the Capitol buildings

01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:22.780
are locked down and everyone is sheltering in place.

01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:25.620
Hey, so look, that's where Ilhan Omar is, everyone.

01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:26.620
Just kidding.

01:47:26.620 --> 01:47:27.620
Uh, uh, what?

01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:28.620
No, just kidding.

01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:30.400
That's not just kidding.

01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:34.980
The joke is, hey, from this vantage point, you can tell where she is.

01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:39.660
You know that there are tons of people who are, who are storming the Capitol building

01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:43.680
and now you're saying, hey, wouldn't it be fun if one of you, wouldn't it be fun?

01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:44.900
She's just joking.

01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:45.900
That's where she is.

01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:46.900
Yeah, that's, that's...

01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:51.660
This person who we've expressed extensive hatred for.

01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:54.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:58.620
Even if I believed somebody was joking when they said that, that's poor taste.

01:47:58.620 --> 01:47:59.620
Oh yeah.

01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:00.620
And he's not joking.

01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:01.620
And he's not joking.

01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:02.620
No.

01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:04.860
So don't give me this just JK bullshit.

01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:05.860
Yeah.

01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:09.380
I would say that Harrison is pragmatic to a fault.

01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:15.260
Um, and that is that he, it does not care at all about the people in the, in the Congress

01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:16.260
building.

01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:17.260
Sure.

01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:21.880
And to a certain extent, I kind of get where he's coming from in terms of like, there are

01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:23.700
safety precautions in place.

01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:24.700
Yeah.

01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:25.700
Like there are evacuation routes.

01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:26.700
Yeah.

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:29.500
There are, you know, so I get, I get where he's coming from.

01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:35.300
It doesn't seem super callous, I guess, but he is just like, eh, who cares?

01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:38.980
They'll be able, the people inside aren't in any danger.

01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:43.820
The congressmen and women and senators, I don't think are at much of a threat.

01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:46.940
We know there's one thing they take very, very seriously.

01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:50.180
It is their own personal wellbeing and their own security.

01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:57.300
There are tunnels of course, crisscrossing like spiderwebs throughout all of DC and there's

01:48:57.300 --> 01:49:02.420
almost no risk of them having to try to escape through a crowd or having to bunker down in

01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:03.420
the Capitol building.

01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:06.940
They have escape routes more than they need.

01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:11.260
So again, I do not think there's actually a bodily threat to anybody in the chambers

01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:12.260
at this moment.

01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:13.380
They don't seem too concerned.

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:18.540
They're continuing to argue, continuing to debate without so much as a look over their

01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:22.260
shoulder as to the doors being broken down or anything like that.

01:49:22.260 --> 01:49:28.140
This is simply a massive protest that is refusing to stay quiet any longer.

01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:30.000
That is making themselves known.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:35.960
That is not stopping at the barricades, not a cow towing and adhering to the police who

01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:40.420
have betrayed us time and time again, but instead are pushing forward to take over what

01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:44.100
is, at the heart of it, our building.

01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:49.420
I find it hard to believe that they would be covering, let's say, Black Lives Matter

01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:51.300
protest at the White House similarly.

01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:52.300
No, the same way.

01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:53.300
Same way.

01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:59.820
I seem to recall when, over the summer, when there were those large fences that people

01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:04.020
were up against and like, you know, yelling at cops and maybe somebody threw a water bottle.

01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:05.020
Right, right.

01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:06.980
A water bottle was a dangerous instrument.

01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:07.980
Yeah, yeah.

01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:13.820
Then it wasn't, you know, a situation where everyone's safe inside, they've got evacuation

01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:14.820
routes.

01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:15.820
Right.

01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:16.820
Right.

01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:17.820
I don't know.

01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:18.820
It just seems a little bit selective.

01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:19.820
I do.

01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:23.460
I do like the, they have more escape tunnels than they need.

01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:25.100
That's such a funny way of putting it.

01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:26.100
They're lousy with escape tunnels.

01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:29.500
That is such a funny, they've got more than they even need.

01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:30.500
Yeah.

01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:33.380
This is the type of thing we're wasting taxpayers' money on.

01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:34.380
Yeah.

01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:35.380
They've got four escape tunnels.

01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:37.780
They've got four that don't go anywhere.

01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:42.120
It's like that Futurama joke where they're carrying the tanker full of oil and he's like,

01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:44.460
this has 5,000 hulls.

01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:48.740
And whenever it breaks open, there's like, oh, if only there were 5,001 hulls.

01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:52.540
It would be great if there's just like, there's so many escape tunnels down here.

01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:53.940
There's like, they go in circles.

01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:54.940
Yeah.

01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:55.940
It's just pointless.

01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:56.940
It's just out of control.

01:50:56.940 --> 01:50:57.940
Yeah.

01:50:57.940 --> 01:50:59.940
So now.

01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:04.660
That's where all, if, if the Capitol building turned into the Scooby-Doo bit, where they're

01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:08.060
all going up through the tunnel and exiting one door and then closing it and then coming

01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:09.060
back out.

01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:10.060
That'd be great.

01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:11.060
So good.

01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:15.060
So at this point, people have breached the building and this is where I think a lot of

01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:19.500
people around the country and the world were like, oh boy, fuck.

01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:20.500
Oh shit.

01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:25.300
Senators, the vice president, the congressmen now no doubt making their way towards the

01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:30.540
security of the underground tunnels to escort them away from the threat of their supposed

01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:36.740
constituents, angry, furious, and now venting that frustration on the system that has betrayed

01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:38.340
them time and time again.

01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:39.740
This is just incredible folks.

01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:41.140
You're watching info wars.

01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:45.700
So you've got people who have come in and the, uh, the evacuation, they're afraid of

01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:46.700
their constituents.

01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:49.020
It's an interesting way to frame it.

01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:54.900
There's a certain part of me that almost is like good on you for sticking with it longer

01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:56.860
than most of the right wing media did.

01:51:56.860 --> 01:52:00.300
Well, you know, like they were already at the point where they're like, this is wrong

01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:01.300
and all this stuff.

01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:04.700
And Harrison Smith is like, this is what we guys, this is what we wanted.

01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:08.020
I remember I wanted, I want to disagree with the phrasing.

01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:09.020
Good on you.

01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:10.020
Yeah.

01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:11.020
Yeah.

01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:12.020
Yeah.

01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:13.020
What you're trying to say, I agree with.

01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:14.020
Yeah.

01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:15.020
Yeah.

01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:16.020
It's remarkable that you are still, you're still on it, buddy.

01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:17.020
Everybody.

01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:18.620
You, if you, at this point, everyone was cutting bait.

01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:21.980
What you didn't realize is that you thought everybody was in a line right next to you

01:52:21.980 --> 01:52:26.420
and you took one step forward and they are gone.

01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:27.620
There's nobody behind me.

01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:28.620
Yeah, no.

01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:29.620
Harrison is thrilled.

01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:30.620
It's a privilege for him.

01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:31.620
Of course.

01:52:31.620 --> 01:52:36.820
Uh, at least I would say my estimation, a million Trump supporters having moved from

01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:40.060
throughout to DC and are now converging on the Capitol.

01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:42.060
This is revolution in progress.

01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:47.020
This is a major historic moment in the history of the United States and is a privilege and

01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:52.100
an honor to be here sharing it with you and bringing you updates just as soon as possible.

01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:56.540
I suspect that he may be more of a true believer than a lot of the people at Infowars.

01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:58.300
Yeah, that sounds like true belief.

01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:00.740
And I also think he's a dork.

01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:02.500
Uh, yeah.

01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:03.500
Anyway.

01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:09.980
I'm, I'm just saying, uh, yes, it is a historic moment, uh, but it will probably be remembered

01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:15.660
more for an idiot in a headdress smiling, carrying a podium than, uh, the, uh,

01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:16.980
There will be a resonant image.

01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:17.980
Yeah.

01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:22.780
But, uh, in order to justify a lot of this, I think, I think Harrison probably has a good

01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:25.580
sense that like, well, people aren't going to like this too much.

01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:26.580
Hmm.

01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:30.540
Going to have to make this palatable, uh, to some of the more normie, uh, parts of the

01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:33.260
audience as if Infowars has a lot of that.

01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:34.260
Yeah, no ton of them.

01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:39.500
Um, the only way that they can do this is by being like, the left protests a lot and

01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:42.180
CVS is burned down and stuff.

01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:49.540
We've seen six months or more of violent protest burning down entire cities, aimless, pointless

01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:55.300
destruction being wrought across the United States by liberal and communist agitators,

01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:57.940
all to the point of trying to tear down our system.

01:53:57.940 --> 01:54:03.900
Now we see not the system fight back, but those who love America fight back patriots

01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:08.900
now taking over the entire Capitol steps, continuing to wave the American flag, the

01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:13.740
Gadsden flag, the tree of Liberty flag, the Trump flag.

01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:15.460
They've taken it over.

01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:16.460
It is done.

01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:18.580
This is what happens when Americans rise up.

01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:23.980
This is what happens when patriots do what the communists have been trying to do for

01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:24.980
so long.

01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:25.980
This doesn't look great.

01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:28.340
I want to, I want them to eat those words.

01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:32.540
I would like to print those words out and I would like to see them eat those papers.

01:54:32.540 --> 01:54:37.380
I don't, I don't think this is going to age great.

01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:42.660
I think Alex might be needing to fire Harrison soon and it's not because he didn't take calls

01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:43.660
on the American Journal.

01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:44.660
No, no, no, no.

01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:48.660
I think that this is something Alex is- It's because he will be getting some calls

01:54:48.660 --> 01:54:49.660
from the authorities.

01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:53.740
I think at a certain point, Alex might have to pretend a lot of this stuff didn't, uh,

01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:54.740
this wasn't what we did.

01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:58.100
This is a rogue Infowars employee who is saying all of this stuff.

01:54:58.100 --> 01:54:59.100
I don't know Harrison.

01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:02.140
The views expressed by Harrison Smith do not represent-

01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:03.260
I never met that guy.

01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:04.260
Never heard of him.

01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:05.260
He's an independent contractor.

01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:06.260
Did you know that, Dan?

01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:10.820
We found those Soros contracts with Antifa though, which we love to report on, Alex.

01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:13.220
Anyway, this is all just the globalists, man.

01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:15.620
They've pushed Patriots too far.

01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:16.620
Totally.

01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:22.100
I have in my note here, this is dramatically pro-storming coverage.

01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:27.080
Time and time again, the American people have shrugged and taken the blows on the back without

01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:33.300
so much as a whimper in protest, but finally they have pushed too far after stealing our

01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:34.300
last resort.

01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:37.420
They always knew in the back of our minds, in the back of our heads, we had the numbers.

01:55:37.420 --> 01:55:38.420
We had the will.

01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:44.300
We could, through the electoral process, maintain some semblance of control over what is supposed

01:55:44.300 --> 01:55:48.060
to be our representative democracy, our republic.

01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:50.260
Well, they stole that from us.

01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:52.460
They took away the final lifeline.

01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:57.300
They destroyed the final pressure valve, and now the rage of the American people overflows

01:55:57.300 --> 01:56:03.300
as Patriots storm into the United States Capitol, waving Trump flags, waving American flags,

01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:07.820
waving the Gadson flag, taking over the steps, pushing through the doors, and forcing an

01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:14.240
evacuation of our representatives as they halt the vote counting process.

01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:15.240
He's loving this.

01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:16.240
Yeah.

01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:17.240
Yep.

01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:18.620
This is the best day of Harrison's career.

01:56:18.620 --> 01:56:24.640
It is so funny listening to that in retrospect, just because that like, this is an ocean wave

01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:30.500
that's coming, and all I can think in my head is, no, you guys have been terrorist edging

01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:33.900
for a long time, and your idiots came too soon.

01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:34.900
That's what happened.

01:56:34.900 --> 01:56:40.100
Yeah, and you're going to end up having to make the best of it, and I think that Alex

01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:45.420
can get that sense once he shows up, but Harrison isn't experienced enough.

01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:51.260
He doesn't really know how to play the game that Alex needs to play in order to be profitable

01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:52.580
in situations like this.

01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:56.380
This is going to take some fine threading, if you will.

01:56:56.380 --> 01:56:59.540
Because Harrison actually believes that there's a chance that this is going to lead to a real

01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:00.540
revolution.

01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:01.540
We're going to do it.

01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.540
We're going to take him over.

01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:03.540
Where Trump is going to stay in office.

01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:04.540
Absolutely.

01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:05.540
Yeah.

01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:06.540
Nonsense.

01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:07.540
Yeah.

01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:08.540
So anyway, he tries to go to Alex, because Alex is in D.C.

01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:09.540
He's somewhere.

01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:10.540
What are we going to figure this out?

01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:13.540
Ah, doesn't really, can't quite get a hold of him.

01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:14.540
Got to go to break.

01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:17.540
But Americans are mad, and so when they stage elections in Venezuela, are they speechless?

01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:20.540
These incredible folks live updates from Alex Jones, more on the other side.

01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:23.940
The Capitol has fallen, the Patriots are in control.

01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:28.540
The Patriots are in control, the Capitol has fallen.

01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:33.060
So he's able to get a hold of Alex there, but he can't talk to him.

01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:34.060
Alex is just rambling.

01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:35.060
Hilarious.

01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:39.740
So they go to break, and the fucking Capitol has fallen, is the report.

01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:46.540
You know, one thing that I like to do is sometimes while the craziest shit is going on, I'll

01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:52.620
split screen it on my computer with just like a stock feed.

01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:55.140
The Capitol has fallen.

01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:57.140
Patriots have taken over.

01:57:57.140 --> 01:58:00.780
Stocks go up by like one point.

01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:07.180
Do you think the stocks would just stay the same if the entire United States had been

01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:08.180
overthrown?

01:58:08.180 --> 01:58:09.180
Well, I mean.

01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:10.180
And Patriots had, come on.

01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:15.740
I know that the stock market lives and dies by the reportage of Harrison Smith.

01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:16.740
Yes, exactly.

01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:20.100
As he's the most trusted newsman of our generation.

01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:21.100
The Cronkite.

01:58:21.100 --> 01:58:22.940
So, the paper of record.

01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:24.100
Millennial Cronkite.

01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:26.980
That's what they call him.

01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:32.060
The young gray lady.

01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:34.620
Old wolf in sheep's clothing blitzer.

01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:35.620
Yeah.

01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:37.780
So, Harrison has a little thought here.

01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:41.340
It's like, hey, we stopped the steel.

01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:49.260
Just the sheer crowds all over the Capitol steps waving stop the steel signs, waving

01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:50.620
American flags.

01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:53.460
For the time being, at least the steel has been stopped.

01:58:53.460 --> 01:59:01.940
We have, we're no longer counting the votes, no longer debating the certification.

01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:09.940
It has all ground to a halt, it has all ceased to continue as the lawmakers and the other

01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:11.820
Capitol Hill staffers flee.

01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:21.140
I just have this picture in my head of Harrison Smith in a fighter pilot outfit on an aircraft

01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:23.140
carrier with a big banner.

01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:24.140
Totally.

01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:25.140
100%.

01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:26.140
Steel stopped.

01:59:26.140 --> 01:59:28.700
Big banner behind.

01:59:28.700 --> 01:59:34.580
I don't know if we can print up a better Dewey defeats Truman than we stopped the steel.

01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:37.340
At least he had the good sense to say at least temporarily.

01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:39.940
At least, yeah, I was going to say.

01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:40.940
Good work, buddy.

01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:48.100
So, there's some stuff going on and it involves protesters, right wing ding dongs, assaulting

01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:52.380
officers and Harrison's pretty excited about that.

01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:57.740
My God, now the protesters have gotten their hands on fire extinguishers and are spraying

01:59:57.740 --> 02:00:03.420
them at the people, the congressional staffers and members of the media who are attempting

02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:04.420
to film them.

02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:10.320
They're getting a face full of fire extinguisher gas as police continue to radio and we heard

02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:15.580
over the radio from the US Capitol Police, we have lost control, repeat, we have lost

02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:17.580
control.

02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:21.500
Control now seated to the patriots who have breached the Capitol.

02:00:21.500 --> 02:00:26.540
Alex did like days worth of coverage about people yelling at Sarah Huckabee Sanders at

02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:27.540
a restaurant.

02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:28.540
They made her feel bad.

02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:30.960
They made her feel bad, it was public.

02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:35.380
Every private citizen is entitled to the right to go eat at a restaurant.

02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:37.780
What if they had sprayed her with a fire extinguisher?

02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:41.020
Well, now that's fine.

02:00:41.020 --> 02:00:43.180
What is she afraid of her constituents, Dan?

02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:47.260
Strictly speaking, that is assault and we've already heard him talking about punching and

02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:53.620
macing coming towards the officers, so that's at least three instances that Harrison is

02:00:53.620 --> 02:01:00.820
very keenly aware of, of violence that's being done by these people against the cops.

02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:09.900
Now obviously no situation is perfect at any protest and I don't think that you can respond

02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:15.900
to the entirety of the group just based on the actions of an individual, but those people

02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:18.620
should definitely have been treated differently.

02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:23.240
What they're doing is not appropriate and it's not property damage that is directed

02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:28.580
towards bodily harm and hurting another person, which is now assault.

02:01:28.580 --> 02:01:33.500
Anyway, I just want to make a clear line there because Harrison later will pretend that he's

02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:35.500
not aware of any violence.

02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:37.500
No violent actions happen.

02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:44.740
So also, interestingly, Harrison's thrilled that they've stolen police equipment.

02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:52.840
People now ceded to the patriots who have breached the Capitol and are moving ever further

02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:54.620
into this Capitol building.

02:01:54.620 --> 02:01:59.100
People dressed as pioneers, people carrying riot shields that have been stripped from

02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:07.420
the Capitol City police, MAGA hats, Confederate flags, American flags, Gadson flags.

02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:15.900
I just can't imagine, you know, the picture, you know, the left-wing protesters have stolen

02:02:15.900 --> 02:02:19.060
riot shields from police and they've entered the state out.

02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:22.220
I can't imagine you being like, this is protest.

02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:23.220
Yeah, yeah.

02:02:23.220 --> 02:02:27.860
You would say this is America's fallen or whatever the fuck, but I guess he is actually

02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:28.860
saying America's fallen.

02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:29.860
Yeah, that's true.

02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:30.860
We have now taken it.

02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:32.860
Yeah, we're stoked about it.

02:02:32.860 --> 02:02:35.780
I guess there isn't that much difference, honestly.

02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:37.980
Yeah, man, weird.

02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:41.980
Weird to think of the number of dead that there would have been if this was a left-wing

02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:42.980
crowd.

02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:44.340
Oh, the people who are...

02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:46.020
So many people would have been killed.

02:02:46.020 --> 02:02:48.180
Yeah, I think you're right.

02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:53.340
It's tough to litigate that kind of what-if, but yeah, I think...

02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:58.140
You know that whole, like, how is it that so many people could do this?

02:02:58.140 --> 02:03:02.680
I thought if you went for the Capitol building, you would just get mowed down, you know?

02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:06.820
If this was a left-wing protest, oh, believe me, you would have.

02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:10.820
It seems that way, yeah.

02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:17.640
So Harrison's still giving positive coverage of this event, and at this point, he does

02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:24.580
know that they've shot tear gas in the chamber, and he's kind of aware that someone got shot.

02:03:24.580 --> 02:03:27.680
He doesn't know any of the details about it, but he's aware that someone...

02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:31.460
There's reports that someone's been shot, and he's still like, eh, it's good times.

02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:35.380
From Disclose TV, protesters are smashing the doors to the U.S. House chamber.

02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:39.260
That's the image that we saw just a second ago of the furniture being piled up in an

02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:44.780
attempt to prevent, or at least waylay or delay, the breaking into the House chamber

02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:45.780
there.

02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:50.140
U.S. Senate chamber has been evacuated, and senators are being taken to a secure location.

02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:54.900
House members are being instructed to put on masks as tear gas is now inside the U.S.

02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:56.140
Capitol dome, folks.

02:03:56.140 --> 02:03:58.300
This is, again, unprecedented.

02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:01.340
This is history being made as we speak.

02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:04.060
So this is, like, severe.

02:04:04.060 --> 02:04:09.940
Like the situation has deteriorated to an outrageous extent, and Harrison's still definitely

02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:16.060
cool with it, to the point where he's saying, like, yeah, they're rioting, but good.

02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:18.220
We took back the Capitol.

02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:24.460
The security of the Capitol building has been utterly devastated and decimated, and the

02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:25.460
rioter...

02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:26.460
Well, yeah, I guess we'll call them rioters.

02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:27.740
Why the hell not, right?

02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:33.380
The rioters, the protesters, the patriots, the Americans, the Trump supporters, the revolutionaries

02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:34.800
have taken the Capitol.

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:37.740
The U.S. Capitol has fallen to the American people.

02:04:37.740 --> 02:04:41.060
This day will go down in history, ladies and gentlemen, and you're getting it all live

02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:43.180
here at m4wars.com.

02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:46.900
Make no mistake about it, this would still be the tone if it had been successful.

02:04:46.900 --> 02:04:47.900
Yeah.

02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:48.900
Yeah, totally.

02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:49.900
Like, this is...

02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:51.260
It would have been more jubilant.

02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:52.260
Yes.

02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:53.260
Yeah.

02:04:53.260 --> 02:04:56.060
This would have continued if shit did not fall apart, and people didn't just leave.

02:04:56.060 --> 02:05:01.820
I want to bottle the feeling of joy that he felt for almost a short period of time.

02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:02.820
Mm-hmm.

02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:03.820
Because that must have been really nice.

02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:08.620
Yeah, but it also comes hand in hand with the embarrassment that he's got to feel now,

02:05:08.620 --> 02:05:09.620
because this was recorded.

02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:10.620
Oh, yeah.

02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:14.620
That's why I would only bottle the joy, and I would enjoy that like a cold glass of water.

02:05:14.620 --> 02:05:15.620
Sorry.

02:05:15.620 --> 02:05:16.620
Mm, that joy is delicious.

02:05:16.620 --> 02:05:18.220
That joy causes the hangover.

02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:22.380
Harrison, you can keep the embarrassment and sadness of being you.

02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:28.820
And unfortunately, that joy has the hangover effect of realizing you were so naive.

02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:30.300
So fucking stupid.

02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:31.300
Yeah.

02:05:31.300 --> 02:05:34.900
Anyway, at this point, Harrison is heard...

02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:37.860
He didn't mention it in that last clip, but he is aware at that point that someone had

02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:39.100
been shot.

02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:43.020
And so now he's reporting that he's heard that someone got shot in the arm.

02:05:43.020 --> 02:05:48.640
Just got this information not confirmed, but we have reports of a woman shot in the arm

02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:50.620
attempting to breach the chamber.

02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:56.620
So we have guns drawn inside the chamber, furniture piled against the door, the security

02:05:56.620 --> 02:06:01.620
is firing out through the door, and is apparently shot woman in the arm.

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:06.900
So this is the reporting that he's giving based on preliminary stuff, which is incorrect,

02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:10.980
but you know, oftentimes as information's coming in, you can make some mistakes here

02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:11.980
and there.

02:06:11.980 --> 02:06:14.660
I'm not going to hold it against him too harshly.

02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:17.940
I am going to blame him for being so goddamn boring.

02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:21.700
I've got to assure you all, Alex will be coming back eventually.

02:06:21.700 --> 02:06:24.740
We'll get to Alex.

02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:29.820
How can you think that you are living through a successful overthrow of the United States

02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:34.260
government by your side, and still be this boring?

02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:35.260
Yeah.

02:06:35.260 --> 02:06:40.140
Well, I mean, on some level he knows he took over for David Knight, so...

02:06:40.140 --> 02:06:41.140
Well, that's fair.

02:06:41.140 --> 02:06:42.140
He knows where the bread's buttered.

02:06:42.140 --> 02:06:43.700
He's got to deliver.

02:06:43.700 --> 02:06:45.620
He's got big shoes to fill.

02:06:45.620 --> 02:06:48.020
Alex probably hired him, he's like, I need a boring guy.

02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:49.540
I need another boring guy.

02:06:49.540 --> 02:06:52.380
I need a backup boring guy in case my relief...

02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:53.620
You're my boring understudy.

02:06:53.620 --> 02:06:55.500
Yeah, you're my relief pitcher.

02:06:55.500 --> 02:07:00.980
So at this point, there's a video going around of some people commandeering a window washing

02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:01.980
rig.

02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:02.980
Sure.

02:07:02.980 --> 02:07:03.980
Yeah.

02:07:03.980 --> 02:07:04.980
And Harrison's fucking pumped.

02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:05.980
Oh my God.

02:07:05.980 --> 02:07:06.980
This is amazing.

02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:09.220
All right, so now we're seeing video of the protesters.

02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:14.780
They seem to have commandeered a window washing platform, and are raising themselves up to

02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:18.820
the second floor to perhaps breach the windows there.

02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:21.860
Trump flags waving, American flags waving.

02:07:21.860 --> 02:07:22.860
Shots have been fired.

02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:29.060
We have reports of one woman shot from a protester, a female protester, has been shot by the Capitol

02:07:29.060 --> 02:07:35.460
security presumably, who is inside the house chamber there, furniture piled up against

02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:36.460
the door.

02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:38.020
There were protesters trying to get through that door.

02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:42.980
Shots were fired through the window of that door, and seemingly struck a protester.

02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:48.300
These are the unconfirmed reports that we are receiving from less than a minute ago,

02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:51.140
and we'll continue to bring you updates as we get them, folks.

02:07:51.140 --> 02:07:56.780
This is the revolution, and it's only going to be televised on Infowars.com.

02:07:56.780 --> 02:07:57.780
I'm receiving updates.

02:07:57.780 --> 02:07:58.780
Oh.

02:07:58.780 --> 02:07:59.780
What a dork.

02:07:59.780 --> 02:08:00.780
Oh, what a loser.

02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:02.320
What a loser.

02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:05.980
You really think this is only going to be covered by Infowars?

02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:06.980
So funny.

02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:08.300
What a fucking...

02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:11.780
Oh, we are getting reports that the Death Star is going down.

02:08:11.780 --> 02:08:13.380
Oh, no, I can see it.

02:08:13.380 --> 02:08:19.860
Luke Skywalker has commandeered a window washing vehicle, and he is slowly making his way towards

02:08:19.860 --> 02:08:22.260
the exhaust port.

02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:25.260
We are going to be televising this the entire way.

02:08:25.260 --> 02:08:31.140
I love this dumb, dumb ass kind of thing where it would be like someone being like, Richard

02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:32.860
Nixon has resigned.

02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:37.220
That's the kind of news you're only going to hear on my channel.

02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:39.260
No, everyone's going to cover that.

02:08:39.260 --> 02:08:45.060
Ladies and gentlemen, I am sad to report that JFK has been assassinated.

02:08:45.060 --> 02:08:46.060
You'll not hear that on other networks.

02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:49.380
You are only going to hear that on Infowars.

02:08:49.380 --> 02:08:51.260
No one else is saying shit about it.

02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:57.020
Pretending this isn't a gigantic news story that is going to dominate every news cycle

02:08:57.020 --> 02:08:58.020
for a while.

02:08:58.020 --> 02:08:59.020
So ridiculous.

02:08:59.020 --> 02:09:00.020
Yeah.

02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:06.140
So at this point, Harrison, I don't know exactly how it happens, maybe by way of images or

02:09:06.140 --> 02:09:12.940
a video, but Harrison comes to the realization that this shooting is worse than he had realized.

02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:14.580
And this is not someone's arm.

02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:16.060
Now we're not having fun.

02:09:16.060 --> 02:09:21.740
The tone shifts dramatically and very, very noticeably.

02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:27.340
And here we see the bloody stretcher and a woman, oh my gosh, oh my God, putting pressure

02:09:27.340 --> 02:09:28.340
on a wound.

02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:31.580
It looked like, we heard before she was shot in the arm, that looked like she was shot

02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:37.080
in the chest, perhaps the collarbone, but absolutely covered in blood as she's rushed

02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:39.500
away from the Capitol.

02:09:39.500 --> 02:09:44.140
This may be the first casualty of the second American revolution.

02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:48.520
This woman who is presumably, oh my God, and they're pumping her, wow, they're pumping

02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:49.840
her chest.

02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:52.820
That means she was most likely unresponsive.

02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:58.500
That woman may have died or at least sustained a critical energy.

02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:02.580
So Harrison, I don't know if he knows how to handle a lot of this stuff.

02:10:02.580 --> 02:10:08.700
This is pretty, this is tough because you've been spending your entire day sort of teasing

02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:15.580
people towards doing something like this, celebrating as it happens, and now the reality

02:10:15.580 --> 02:10:19.880
that someone has been shot and is probably dead.

02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:20.880
It's tough.

02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:24.260
It's tough to cover all of that.

02:10:24.260 --> 02:10:27.180
Especially when you're someone like Harrison who just doesn't have the skills.

02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:34.980
It is in the real world, in his world, in the world that they all believe in, that should

02:10:34.980 --> 02:10:37.900
be expected?

02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:41.620
That should be an expected casualty of your fucking revolution?

02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:45.260
Are you telling me, are you telling me that you think you're going to overthrow a fucking

02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:50.980
country and then you're going to get all wingy and sad when someone gets shot and dies?

02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:51.980
Fuck off.

02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:56.540
And I think there's some decent instincts on Harrison's part with saying like the first

02:10:56.540 --> 02:10:58.660
casualty of the American Revolution.

02:10:58.660 --> 02:11:00.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:01.060
That's what you should be saying.

02:11:01.060 --> 02:11:03.900
That's him keeping it in the pocket of the patriot lore.

02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:04.900
Yeah, exactly.

02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:07.700
That he needs to build in real time in order to be profitable.

02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:14.420
But at the same time, from an emotional standpoint and from a performance standpoint, I don't

02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:18.060
see him being able to keep up his character.

02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:21.300
No, no, because it's a character.

02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:23.740
And because this is someone's dead.

02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:25.560
I understand that somebody's dead.

02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:28.100
In the real world, that's a fucking tragedy.

02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:34.460
What I'm saying is that these people are imagining themselves as fucking revolutionaries, and

02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:39.600
then they all quit and cried because somebody died.

02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:44.700
You cannot scream 1776 at me and then be like, whoa, somebody got shot?

02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:45.700
Oh my god.

02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:51.060
Well, I can explain Alex's angle on it much better as soon as he comes around.

02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:53.220
Harrison's a little bit more of a mystery to me.

02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:57.460
And I think, I'm not entirely sure, I just don't think he's very good.

02:11:57.460 --> 02:11:58.760
No, he sucks.

02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:01.220
He's supposed to be doing a job, but I just don't think he does it very well.

02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:04.340
And that's why you gotta get Alex and Owen on the phone.

02:12:04.340 --> 02:12:05.340
Shit's getting real.

02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:06.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:12:06.340 --> 02:12:12.300
So they get on the phone, and Owen's trying to talk to Harrison, his good friend who saw

02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:13.300
him in that video.

02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:14.300
You know, they're buddies.

02:12:14.300 --> 02:12:15.300
Yeah, yeah, they're great.

02:12:15.300 --> 02:12:19.980
Alex just keeps yelling in the background, contradicting the entire day's coverage.

02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:20.980
Love it.

02:12:20.980 --> 02:12:21.980
Dave, I'm on air right now.

02:12:21.980 --> 02:12:23.300
No, basically, okay.

02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:25.980
I want to get live, Dave, so I'm just hearing this story.

02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:29.660
The city is going under martial law, we caught Antifa provocateurs, with witnesses and the

02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:33.980
footage that first started the storming, but then triggered all this.

02:12:33.980 --> 02:12:37.020
So Alex is going to be breaking that down momentarily.

02:12:37.020 --> 02:12:40.460
Yeah, in a moment Alex is going to be explaining that Antifa did all this.

02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:41.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:45.660
Because now we gotta figure out a way to not have any kind of involvement.

02:12:45.660 --> 02:12:47.700
This is going to look bad.

02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:50.620
We gotta thread this needle, baby.

02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:51.620
Aw, man.

02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:52.620
Yep.

02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:56.420
These white people are so fucking entitled, they think they're entitled to a revolution

02:12:56.420 --> 02:12:58.300
without getting hurt.

02:12:58.300 --> 02:12:59.300
Or looking bad.

02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:00.300
Yeah, exactly.

02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:04.860
So Alex is decreeing in the background, yelling while Owen's on the phone, that they're going

02:13:04.860 --> 02:13:05.860
commercial-free.

02:13:05.860 --> 02:13:09.860
They can't go commercial-free on all shows, commercial-free.

02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:13.980
I'm telling you folks, this is historic, they've declared basically martial law, they're sending

02:13:13.980 --> 02:13:18.900
in National Guard, it's absolutely insane, all because Antifa, the minute Trump announced

02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:24.580
he was going to come speak, Antifa, dressed up like patriots but with knee pads and arm

02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:27.740
pads, attacked the police to stage the triggered event.

02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:31.020
So they triggered this stampede, we have the witnesses, we have the police.

02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:34.780
I guess at this point he had taken the phone from Owen, which is probably smart.

02:13:34.780 --> 02:13:37.660
It would be smart, because Owen clearly doesn't have the lines yet.

02:13:37.660 --> 02:13:44.620
No, no, and Alex can just rattle off this narrative without anything.

02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:48.780
No, no, and it could be a switch that he flips instantly and just be like, oh are we doing

02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:49.780
Antifa now?

02:13:49.780 --> 02:13:52.580
Okay, I'll switch to my Antifa rambling nonsense.

02:13:52.580 --> 02:14:02.260
And if I have my timeline right, the National Guard definitely had not been at this point.

02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:07.740
This is tough, because this is a direct contradiction of Harrison's narrative that he's been building

02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:11.840
for hours at this point, watching this event happen live.

02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:15.780
This is patriots who have righteous indignation, they've been pushed too far.

02:14:15.780 --> 02:14:22.260
No it's not, it's Antifa provocateur-ing, and they're the ones who stormed things.

02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:26.260
The patriots were trying to keep it peaceful, they had not had enough, they could put up

02:14:26.260 --> 02:14:27.260
with much more.

02:14:27.260 --> 02:14:28.260
God dammit.

02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:31.740
So now we have two completely contradictory narratives being sold.

02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:38.360
Now, Owen is on the same phone call with Alex, and he is there, he's contradicting Alex.

02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:39.360
He's got number three?

02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:43.060
It's so tough to really put this into perspective, because here's the deal, we're not violent

02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:49.220
revolutionaries, but they've taken our country, our country is occupied, and you can debate

02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:54.220
all day long what the appropriate response is, the point is, we finally have a response,

02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:58.620
and we haven't had any fight in our Congress, we haven't had any fight in our legislatures,

02:14:58.620 --> 02:15:01.060
and so this is what's going to happen, is we the people are going to have to fight.

02:15:01.060 --> 02:15:06.340
Again, we did not come here as violent revolutionaries, but the history is definitely being made right

02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:07.340
now.

02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:12.100
I don't know if today is the turning point that will change the course of American history,

02:15:12.100 --> 02:15:15.460
but this is just the nexus of the beginning.

02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:20.680
So this is a direct contradiction of Alex, he's closer to the narrative that Harrison

02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:24.500
has been selling throughout the day, this is patriots who have had enough.

02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:30.220
Now the thing that I have a difficult time with is we can have different opinions about

02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:35.100
I don't know whether pasta is good, like maybe you don't like it.

02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:36.100
Who, you and me?

02:15:36.100 --> 02:15:37.100
Yeah, it's sort of an opinion.

02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:38.100
We have different opinions.

02:15:38.100 --> 02:15:40.300
Yeah, but we both agree that pasta exists.

02:15:40.300 --> 02:15:44.180
I begrudgingly admit that, yes.

02:15:44.180 --> 02:15:50.740
They have fundamental contradictions about the reality of what has happened and what

02:15:50.740 --> 02:15:52.540
it means and everything.

02:15:52.540 --> 02:15:58.220
These two things cannot coexist together, and they're asking their audience to believe

02:15:58.220 --> 02:16:03.340
that it's just sort of a little disagreement that we have, sort of an interpretation thing.

02:16:03.340 --> 02:16:04.340
No, it's not.

02:16:04.340 --> 02:16:05.340
No.

02:16:05.340 --> 02:16:06.340
It's very important.

02:16:06.340 --> 02:16:12.380
There's something that's underappreciated about, I think the difference that we're seeing

02:16:12.380 --> 02:16:20.500
between these and the Black Lives Matter protests is kind of built around the fact that all

02:16:20.500 --> 02:16:24.580
of these right wing ding dongs are fighting a different enemy.

02:16:24.580 --> 02:16:29.540
Like they all have their own conception of the evil government, whether it's lizards

02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:34.500
or anything, it's all completely different from the person standing next to them.

02:16:34.500 --> 02:16:39.580
They have same things they chant and same things they scream, but deep down they're

02:16:39.580 --> 02:16:41.980
all fighting a different fight.

02:16:41.980 --> 02:16:46.980
And in Portland, everybody was fighting the same singular fight.

02:16:46.980 --> 02:16:47.980
Sure.

02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:52.900
And one of the things that I actually think is at the core of why I disagree with you

02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:57.520
about the nature of what happened on Wednesday, where you're saying they all looked stupid

02:16:57.520 --> 02:16:59.960
and this is going to have a deflationary effect.

02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:08.580
I look at this and I worry that the way that it will be used, this event, will be used

02:17:08.580 --> 02:17:14.700
in the same way that things like Ruby Ridge and Waco were used in the 90s.

02:17:14.700 --> 02:17:20.140
In the aftermath of those events, you had the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous, where you had

02:17:20.140 --> 02:17:24.640
a bunch of different right wing extremist groups who also didn't see eye to eye about

02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:26.400
what their enemy was.

02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:29.540
Some people thought it was just a big government.

02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:32.380
Some people thought it was the Jews.

02:17:32.380 --> 02:17:36.140
And they all got together and were like, well, we got to work together.

02:17:36.140 --> 02:17:41.900
And that is what emboldened and grew the militia right wing community in the 90s.

02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:49.060
I do worry that this will have a galvanizing effect, especially with you have a death that,

02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:55.040
spoiler alert, is something that Alex is going to try and use to make a martyr out of.

02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:58.540
That is going to be the game that Alex ends up playing.

02:17:58.540 --> 02:18:04.140
You have a lot of the essential elements that you would need to try and create this focal

02:18:04.140 --> 02:18:11.260
point where you could get people of different, like, how could you get QAnon folks and Alex

02:18:11.260 --> 02:18:14.020
to work side by side?

02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:20.060
Seems like this is something that we could reach detente over.

02:18:20.060 --> 02:18:21.060
I get that.

02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:22.060
I get that.

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:27.380
I think the difference for me between the Ruby Ridge and those examples that you've

02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:34.140
given are that they were in response to an aggressor.

02:18:34.140 --> 02:18:36.980
There were people coming at them as well.

02:18:36.980 --> 02:18:43.100
It was not a, it was not a bunch of morons and the cops let them go.

02:18:43.100 --> 02:18:44.340
There was a conflict.

02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:45.340
We don't have time.

02:18:45.340 --> 02:18:46.740
I know we're not going to do all that.

02:18:46.740 --> 02:18:52.740
No, we don't have time to get into all of that, but I will say that perception is what's

02:18:52.740 --> 02:18:55.820
more important than reality in terms of Patriot lore.

02:18:55.820 --> 02:18:56.820
I agree.

02:18:56.820 --> 02:19:02.980
The stories that can be told can put people in the roles that they need to be in in order

02:19:02.980 --> 02:19:08.100
to make the story that you would see as a bunch of losers going home and looking stupid

02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:10.260
as being exactly what's needed.

02:19:10.260 --> 02:19:12.300
I will be interested to see how they do it.

02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:15.140
I'm not saying that that is what's going to happen.

02:19:15.140 --> 02:19:18.740
As I was seeing all this happen, that was the fear that I had.

02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:25.100
That was the worry that I have about the pieces of this and the way that I see Alex responding

02:19:25.100 --> 02:19:26.100
to it.

02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:29.900
That is, is kind of, but I don't know.

02:19:29.900 --> 02:19:30.900
We'll see.

02:19:30.900 --> 02:19:31.900
Yeah.

02:19:31.900 --> 02:19:37.420
Anyway, um, everybody's contradicting each other in a way that is, um, it's just, it's,

02:19:37.420 --> 02:19:38.420
it's incomprehensible.

02:19:38.420 --> 02:19:42.820
If you're a listener, I guess you just gotta be on team Owen and Harrison or team Alex.

02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:43.820
Yeah, whatever.

02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:44.820
Or whomever.

02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:49.580
And now Harrison has realized that, uh, shit, someone got shot, probably dead.

02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:50.860
Um, you know what?

02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:53.340
These protesters, they were completely nonviolent.

02:19:53.340 --> 02:19:54.340
Get the fuck out.

02:19:54.340 --> 02:19:59.900
That's the only violence I have seen perpetrated so far beyond, uh, you know, one or two punches

02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:03.100
in return for a punch thrown by a police officer.

02:20:03.100 --> 02:20:07.040
The only violence I have seen has been the cold blooded point blank shooting of a woman

02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:11.980
in the chest by the capital city police rather.

02:20:11.980 --> 02:20:12.980
Yeah.

02:20:12.980 --> 02:20:13.980
That's the only violence.

02:20:13.980 --> 02:20:20.180
Gone are the memories of people shooting fire extinguishers at cops, cops, cops, anytime

02:20:20.180 --> 02:20:21.180
they punched.

02:20:21.180 --> 02:20:24.580
Sure, they punched a cop, but that's not violence.

02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:27.900
That's more like, you know, Oh, we're all tough guys here.

02:20:27.900 --> 02:20:28.900
Yeah.

02:20:28.900 --> 02:20:33.380
So now the entire tone has kind of changed for Harrison and he's in justification mode

02:20:33.380 --> 02:20:37.140
and it's almost entirely for a long stretch of time.

02:20:37.140 --> 02:20:43.060
Him talking about how the left gets to protest, protest against them, then you get shot.

02:20:43.060 --> 02:20:44.700
The leftists are saying, just shoot them all.

02:20:44.700 --> 02:20:48.160
You know, if you dare protest against us, we can protest, we can burn your city down

02:20:48.160 --> 02:20:49.160
for a year and a half.

02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:53.900
And just, you know, for a year, for four years, we can just, um, obstruct everything.

02:20:53.900 --> 02:20:54.900
We can destroy everything.

02:20:54.900 --> 02:21:00.740
We can murder people in cold blood vice magazine will give us a, uh, a good 30 minute documentary

02:21:00.740 --> 02:21:09.140
in order to call him racist and a bigot and a Nazi in order to justify his death.

02:21:09.140 --> 02:21:12.600
That's the reaction you get if you are a protester on the left.

02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:14.140
This is really hollow for me.

02:21:14.140 --> 02:21:18.380
Uh, but it seems to be like their mic drop moment because Harrison just keeps coming

02:21:18.380 --> 02:21:20.940
back to that argument and it's just, I don't care.

02:21:20.940 --> 02:21:21.940
Yeah.

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:23.220
I get the fuck out of here.

02:21:23.220 --> 02:21:28.900
Um, so he hears what Ted Cruz's response is and I think Harrison's a little bit surprised

02:21:28.900 --> 02:21:33.020
to learn that Ted Cruz is not on board with this from Ted Cruz.

02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:35.860
He says, quote, those storming in the Capitol need to stop.

02:21:35.860 --> 02:21:39.900
Now the constitution protects peaceful protest, but violence from the left or right is always

02:21:39.900 --> 02:21:40.900
wrong.

02:21:40.900 --> 02:21:41.900
I've not seen any violence.

02:21:41.900 --> 02:21:43.660
I've not seen any violence from the protesters yet.

02:21:43.660 --> 02:21:44.660
Am I wrong?

02:21:44.660 --> 02:21:47.500
And the crew tell me, have I seen, have I seen violence from the protesters?

02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:48.500
Yes, you have.

02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:49.500
You've mentioned some of it.

02:21:49.500 --> 02:21:50.740
You commented on it earlier, sir.

02:21:50.740 --> 02:21:52.180
And you were excited about it.

02:21:52.180 --> 02:21:53.180
You were stoked.

02:21:53.180 --> 02:21:54.180
Yeah.

02:21:54.180 --> 02:21:55.180
In fact.

02:21:55.180 --> 02:21:56.180
Weird.

02:21:56.180 --> 02:21:57.180
Things change.

02:21:57.180 --> 02:22:02.300
So, um, uh, speaking of things changing, uh, he, Harrison better fucking hope that some

02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:06.740
of the people that he's talking about in this clip didn't do what he's saying they did.

02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:08.140
Cause if so, they're going to prison.

02:22:08.140 --> 02:22:09.140
Oh no.

02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:14.020
Uh, the people who have been able to successfully break into, uh, Senate offices and congressional

02:22:14.020 --> 02:22:20.120
offices, uh, did so with such swiftness that the protesters there were, or the, I'm sorry,

02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:26.140
the, uh, the staffers and congressmen and senators there were unable to even grab their

02:22:26.140 --> 02:22:29.660
information, grab their papers or even shut down their computers.

02:22:29.660 --> 02:22:35.300
So now unlocked and open to anybody, those computers are being accessed by the protesters

02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:40.340
who themselves are gathering information, downloading hard drives or stealing the hard

02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:41.340
drives outright.

02:22:41.340 --> 02:22:46.380
Uh, we can expect to see the fallout from this continue on for a very long time.

02:22:46.380 --> 02:22:53.540
But I remind you again, after a year of complete chaos, a year of protest, a year of literally

02:22:53.540 --> 02:22:58.960
tens of thousands of violent riots, I'm not saying, I'm not saying that it's impossible

02:22:58.960 --> 02:23:03.820
that, uh, some people took some stuff or might've accessed some stuff, but like that was, that's

02:23:03.820 --> 02:23:06.420
a very serious, like national security problem.

02:23:06.420 --> 02:23:08.620
That's a, that's a sitcom plot.

02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:11.240
That's something that I don't think that people will take lightly.

02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:15.740
What did, what did Chandler bring home from the White House?

02:23:15.740 --> 02:23:18.660
Uh oh, it's the governor's fucking hard drive.

02:23:18.660 --> 02:23:19.660
Oh no.

02:23:19.660 --> 02:23:23.300
It's, uh, yeah, Schumer's motherboard.

02:23:23.300 --> 02:23:24.300
What are we going to do?

02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:25.780
We got to get rid of it.

02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:26.780
Yeah.

02:23:26.780 --> 02:23:32.860
It'd be good to like, if these fucking ding dongs didn't live stream themselves without

02:23:32.860 --> 02:23:33.860
masks on.

02:23:33.860 --> 02:23:34.860
I know.

02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:39.620
Going into these offices where allegedly they are stealing, uh, maybe, uh, privileged or

02:23:39.620 --> 02:23:40.960
classified information.

02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:47.220
It's a good thing that they decided to storm one of the least heavily surveilled buildings,

02:23:47.220 --> 02:23:49.020
uh, without masks on.

02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:50.020
Yeah.

02:23:50.020 --> 02:23:54.180
You know, that Capitol building, I'm glad they just don't have many cameras there or

02:23:54.180 --> 02:23:59.820
recording equipment of any kind to, to like, the perfect heist.

02:23:59.820 --> 02:24:09.800
Anyway, were they filming, was George Clooney there?

02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:13.260
Is this like a Jimmy Fallon in that Boston movie?

02:24:13.260 --> 02:24:15.540
It's Pawns 11.

02:24:15.540 --> 02:24:22.340
So at this point, Alex has suggested that it's Antifa that is orchestrating or provocateering

02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:26.460
all of this, but Harrison is, this is still real to him, man.

02:24:26.460 --> 02:24:31.740
We have heard time and time again how valuable protests are, how good protests are, how Antifa

02:24:31.740 --> 02:24:36.940
is only an idea, how Black Lives Matter is simply a set of beliefs that if you don't

02:24:36.940 --> 02:24:42.340
believe you're racist, uh, and we've watched silently because we always knew that the end

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:43.740
of the day, we had our vote.

02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:48.260
We always knew that when it came right down to it, the American system was powerful enough,

02:24:48.260 --> 02:24:50.920
flexible enough.

02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:52.820
Is that what you guys were talking about?

02:24:52.820 --> 02:24:55.320
To voting, maintain.

02:24:55.320 --> 02:25:02.460
And we knew that if we just trusted and exerted our rights as members of a Republican citizens

02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:07.940
of this democracy, that we could regain our footing and get back on track.

02:25:07.940 --> 02:25:10.160
Well, that vote has been stolen from us.

02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:16.660
If you're wondering what is inspiring the overwhelming, um, activity that we're seeing

02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:21.780
here on violent activity, some supporters move into the Capitol building and start to

02:25:21.780 --> 02:25:27.920
destroy things, uh, it's that that last release valve has been taken, destroyed, perverted

02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:35.500
and prevented from being accessed and used by the people who for so long have patiently

02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:38.860
stood by and watched their country literally burned around them.

02:25:38.860 --> 02:25:43.060
So I guess it wasn't Antifa provocateur-ing things, I guess it was that people had their

02:25:43.060 --> 02:25:46.760
right to vote stolen and they'd had enough and this is the only thing that could remedy

02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:47.760
that.

02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:52.040
Yeah, but it was Antifa who exploited that to make them do things that they didn't want

02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:55.500
to do, even though the things that they did are the things that they did want to do.

02:25:55.500 --> 02:26:01.140
I bet, I bet, like, if pushed Alex might be able to come up with that, but that's not

02:26:01.140 --> 02:26:02.140
what he said.

02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:03.540
I don't think you can sell that one.

02:26:03.540 --> 02:26:11.700
So this next clip is really where I found myself saying, oh, Alex, oh no, um, this is

02:26:11.700 --> 02:26:16.620
sad, um, this is really indicative of how Alex operates.

02:26:16.620 --> 02:26:21.460
Mike down for this because Owen's going to talk about this shooting and he listened to

02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:23.980
Alex's response.

02:26:23.980 --> 02:26:26.660
People apparently have been shot inside the Capitol.

02:26:26.660 --> 02:26:28.780
Now we're still getting intel on what that is.

02:26:28.780 --> 02:26:33.220
We've gotten to a safe location because it was just too crazy out there on the streets.

02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:34.940
But that was Capitol police.

02:26:34.940 --> 02:26:35.940
That's probably false.

02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:36.940
That's the left.

02:26:36.940 --> 02:26:38.940
Probably we're going to get later and the intel is probably false.

02:26:38.940 --> 02:26:39.940
What's false?

02:26:39.940 --> 02:26:40.940
The shooting inside.

02:26:40.940 --> 02:26:44.420
Well, there was, I mean, a woman came out in a gurney bleeding, so I don't know who,

02:26:44.420 --> 02:26:45.420
we don't know who did it.

02:26:45.420 --> 02:26:46.500
Point is, it's crazy.

02:26:46.500 --> 02:26:53.140
Point is, there's video now of the shooting having taken place.

02:26:53.140 --> 02:26:58.420
So Alex, based on nothing, his response is that's probably fake.

02:26:58.420 --> 02:26:59.420
Probably fake.

02:26:59.420 --> 02:27:01.020
This shooting is probably fake.

02:27:01.020 --> 02:27:03.100
Alex, I saw somebody going out there with a girl.

02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:05.540
I'm just throwing that out there in case you want to use that later.

02:27:05.540 --> 02:27:06.540
It's probably fake.

02:27:06.540 --> 02:27:07.540
Things are crazy.

02:27:07.540 --> 02:27:08.540
Just in case you were wondering, probably fake.

02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:10.360
And Harrison has to come in and be like, there's video.

02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:12.340
You can't, you can't deny this.

02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:13.500
That's fake.

02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:14.560
That's just random.

02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:15.560
That's knee jerk.

02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:16.560
He's basing that on nothing.

02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:17.560
Just anything.

02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:18.560
That is just.

02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:19.560
That makes us look bad.

02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:22.060
Let's say it's fake first and let's just see if we can get away with it.

02:27:22.060 --> 02:27:23.060
Let's see how it feels.

02:27:23.060 --> 02:27:24.060
Yeah.

02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:25.060
Yeah.

02:27:25.060 --> 02:27:26.060
Yeah.

02:27:26.060 --> 02:27:27.060
Let's taste it in our mouths a little bit.

02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:29.780
So he has been now refuted by both of his employees.

02:27:29.780 --> 02:27:30.780
Yeah.

02:27:30.780 --> 02:27:31.780
Yeah.

02:27:31.780 --> 02:27:32.780
Alex, no.

02:27:32.780 --> 02:27:33.780
Who are not getting the lines.

02:27:33.780 --> 02:27:34.780
We cannot do that.

02:27:34.780 --> 02:27:35.820
They are not getting the lines.

02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:37.820
There's video.

02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:38.820
Can't fight that.

02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:42.080
So Alex makes up another detail.

02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:45.980
So now Pence has also betrayed President Donald Trump.

02:27:45.980 --> 02:27:52.340
So Trump is now a man on a, on a mountain by himself and he has we the people fighting

02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:53.340
for him.

02:27:53.340 --> 02:27:56.820
By the way, the police just confirmed one woman was shot in the leg inside the Capitol.

02:27:56.820 --> 02:27:58.780
Alex is making up that confirmation.

02:27:58.780 --> 02:28:00.540
He didn't get that confirmation from anybody.

02:28:00.540 --> 02:28:01.540
No.

02:28:01.540 --> 02:28:02.540
She didn't get shot in the leg.

02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:07.780
That, he's just making that up because he has to, he has to admit that someone got shot

02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:12.260
and it's not fake because of the pushback that he got from his employees, but he can't

02:28:12.260 --> 02:28:15.680
let it be as serious as it looks like it might be.

02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:16.940
So it's someone was shot in the leg.

02:28:16.940 --> 02:28:19.060
And he can't also just say he was wrong.

02:28:19.060 --> 02:28:21.460
He has to say, I got word that it was confirmed.

02:28:21.460 --> 02:28:22.460
Yes.

02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:23.460
Yes.

02:28:23.460 --> 02:28:24.460
It's all made up.

02:28:24.460 --> 02:28:25.460
Yep.

02:28:25.460 --> 02:28:30.460
So Alex has decided that this is Antifa and he explains his evidence for this.

02:28:30.460 --> 02:28:33.660
And when I say evidence, I'm being incredibly generous.

02:28:33.660 --> 02:28:34.660
Okay.

02:28:34.660 --> 02:28:38.660
I would describe this as a, he imagined that it was Antifa.

02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:39.660
Okay.

02:28:39.660 --> 02:28:43.300
Folks saw him militarily come in, a lot of vets were over here and they said, yeah, they

02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:44.300
were very military.

02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:47.420
My elbow pads and knee pads kind of gray outfits.

02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:50.260
They came in, attacked the riot police and said, let's go, let's do it.

02:28:50.260 --> 02:28:51.820
Got some people to follow them.

02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:55.780
Then they all pulled out real quick and I ran to a bunch of experts who were witnesses

02:28:55.780 --> 02:28:56.780
to what else happened.

02:28:56.780 --> 02:29:00.260
But as soon as I saw the footage, Trump had just announced, I'm going to drive in 20 minutes

02:29:00.260 --> 02:29:04.860
over there from his big rally for a peaceful protest here at the Capitol within minutes

02:29:04.860 --> 02:29:05.860
of that.

02:29:05.860 --> 02:29:06.860
Everybody's like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:29:06.860 --> 02:29:08.260
People are attacking the police.

02:29:08.260 --> 02:29:09.540
All this crazy stuff's happening.

02:29:09.540 --> 02:29:11.140
All this crazy stuff's going down.

02:29:11.140 --> 02:29:13.780
All this crazy stuff's unfolding.

02:29:13.780 --> 02:29:16.220
And then boom, I was like, man, they're going to do provocateur action.

02:29:16.220 --> 02:29:19.640
And sure enough minutes later that happened 95% of provocateur.

02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:20.640
We have the witnesses.

02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:21.640
We have the footage.

02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:22.640
We have so much.

02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:23.640
We have the witness footage.

02:29:23.640 --> 02:29:24.640
We have the witnesses.

02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:25.640
We have the witnesses.

02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:26.640
We have the footage.

02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:27.640
We have the witness footage.

02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:29.060
We got it all.

02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:31.220
We got all three kinds of footage.

02:29:31.220 --> 02:29:35.020
Alex is basically just saying, Hey, I thought that they might do a provocateur thing.

02:29:35.020 --> 02:29:36.020
So they did.

02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:37.020
They did.

02:29:37.020 --> 02:29:38.020
They totally did.

02:29:38.020 --> 02:29:39.020
I proved it.

02:29:39.020 --> 02:29:40.020
Aha.

02:29:40.020 --> 02:29:41.020
We saw it.

02:29:41.020 --> 02:29:42.020
There's this guy.

02:29:42.020 --> 02:29:43.020
He was dressed.

02:29:43.020 --> 02:29:44.020
It's amazing how good Antifa is.

02:29:44.020 --> 02:29:46.540
He was dressed exactly like you would expect somebody at this rally to be dressed.

02:29:46.540 --> 02:29:50.980
He was screaming things that like, I screamed, so you know that he was Antifa because they

02:29:50.980 --> 02:29:52.260
wouldn't say the things that I say.

02:29:52.260 --> 02:29:56.220
We all know that the Antifa is mostly out of work theater students.

02:29:56.220 --> 02:29:57.220
And they are so good.

02:29:57.220 --> 02:29:58.220
They're good at acting.

02:29:58.220 --> 02:30:00.980
This guy even had a Nazi tattoo on his neck.

02:30:00.980 --> 02:30:03.100
How good is Antifa at provocateuring?

02:30:03.100 --> 02:30:04.100
We know that was a stick-on.

02:30:04.100 --> 02:30:09.340
Amazing how good they are at mimicking their infiltrators.

02:30:09.340 --> 02:30:12.260
So one of the things that was jarring about this is they kind of go back and forth from

02:30:12.260 --> 02:30:17.540
Harrison doing some reporting and Alex doing his yelling.

02:30:17.540 --> 02:30:23.500
And so Harrison, you know, I would say one of the most important things in a situation

02:30:23.500 --> 02:30:27.700
like this is not to just say anything on air.

02:30:27.700 --> 02:30:33.860
When you have a tense situation and you have a lot of information coming in, some of it

02:30:33.860 --> 02:30:34.860
might be wrong.

02:30:34.860 --> 02:30:35.860
Yeah.

02:30:35.860 --> 02:30:36.860
You might want to vet some things.

02:30:36.860 --> 02:30:37.860
Right.

02:30:37.860 --> 02:30:41.620
I understand that there's an impulse to report everything as quickly as you can.

02:30:41.620 --> 02:30:45.500
Sometimes it's best to take a breath and wait a little while.

02:30:45.500 --> 02:30:47.180
Harrison is from a different school.

02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:48.180
Oh, okay.

02:30:48.180 --> 02:30:52.620
This is unconfirmed, but it does say that protesters are engaging U.S. Secret Service

02:30:52.620 --> 02:30:54.620
hand-to-hand combat.

02:30:54.620 --> 02:30:55.620
Okay.

02:30:55.620 --> 02:30:56.620
Unconfirmed.

02:30:56.620 --> 02:31:00.540
I'm not sure if that's a troll post or not.

02:31:00.540 --> 02:31:05.380
Usually not good on your news outlet to read something and then afterwards when you sound

02:31:05.380 --> 02:31:09.900
stupid coming out of your mouth, like, ah, that might be trolling.

02:31:09.900 --> 02:31:13.540
Ladies and gentlemen, I am just getting word that Olympus has fallen.

02:31:13.540 --> 02:31:15.580
Oh wait, no, that might be a troll.

02:31:15.580 --> 02:31:21.380
Oh wait, earlier I did say that the Capitol is fallen.

02:31:21.380 --> 02:31:22.380
Well there's that.

02:31:22.380 --> 02:31:24.700
That might've been trolling.

02:31:24.700 --> 02:31:26.180
So anyway, back to Alex yelling.

02:31:26.180 --> 02:31:30.300
Look, there's a communist Chinese takeover with the new world order of the country.

02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:31.300
They're trying to steal the election.

02:31:31.300 --> 02:31:32.300
They're trying to bankrupt the nation.

02:31:32.300 --> 02:31:34.300
They're telling us the country shouldn't even exist.

02:31:34.300 --> 02:31:36.420
They're telling us the word mother and father can't exist.

02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:39.660
This is a communist takeover and everybody knows it.

02:31:39.660 --> 02:31:43.940
And South America is starting to push back and GGP and everybody else needs to know you're

02:31:43.940 --> 02:31:45.660
the one starting all this, not us.

02:31:45.660 --> 02:31:48.900
And you're the ones that are going to pay just like Hitler and just like all the rest

02:31:48.900 --> 02:31:49.900
of scumbags.

02:31:49.900 --> 02:31:52.160
And you know, this is, this is what happens.

02:31:52.160 --> 02:31:53.160
This is the result.

02:31:53.160 --> 02:31:57.060
This is like if you don't, if you don't deal with a cancer and you have cancer and you

02:31:57.060 --> 02:32:00.460
don't deal with it until it's too late, they basically only have one shot and that's just

02:32:00.460 --> 02:32:04.780
a chemotherapy radiate the hell out of you and then hope you can survive.

02:32:04.780 --> 02:32:05.780
That's what we're going through.

02:32:05.780 --> 02:32:09.100
We've had a cancer in this country for decades.

02:32:09.100 --> 02:32:12.140
We've had a communist Chinese takeover for decades.

02:32:12.140 --> 02:32:16.900
We've been occupied by tyrants for decades and we've been ignoring it.

02:32:16.900 --> 02:32:17.900
Whoa.

02:32:17.900 --> 02:32:18.900
That's pretty severe.

02:32:18.900 --> 02:32:19.900
Yeah.

02:32:19.900 --> 02:32:25.100
I mean, we're at a point now where they have no reason to be like gung ho about this.

02:32:25.100 --> 02:32:26.420
Everyone's backed off, buddy.

02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:27.420
Yeah.

02:32:27.420 --> 02:32:28.420
Yeah.

02:32:28.420 --> 02:32:30.780
Um, yeah, it's, uh, it's, it's troubling.

02:32:30.780 --> 02:32:32.340
What a bunch of idiots.

02:32:32.340 --> 02:32:33.340
Yeah.

02:32:33.340 --> 02:32:38.980
This is, they, this is how it was going to go.

02:32:38.980 --> 02:32:42.540
How is this taking them by so, so much surprise?

02:32:42.540 --> 02:32:48.820
Well, I think that they're used to acting in ways that would conceivably lead to something

02:32:48.820 --> 02:32:51.620
like this, uh, and then it never happens.

02:32:51.620 --> 02:32:55.060
And so I think that they're pretty used to that outcome.

02:32:55.060 --> 02:32:59.860
And so it's kind of surprising to be, uh, the stars have aligned in such a way that

02:32:59.860 --> 02:33:04.100
the other influences are actually making this happen.

02:33:04.100 --> 02:33:07.780
Oh, um, I don't know if they, they know how to, uh, to react.

02:33:07.780 --> 02:33:09.840
And that's why I think you see a little bit of flailing.

02:33:09.840 --> 02:33:14.300
You see, um, contradictory narratives being thrown out.

02:33:14.300 --> 02:33:18.500
You have Alex trying to insist it's Antifa, but then at the same time, that last clip

02:33:18.500 --> 02:33:21.260
seemed to sound like he was saying it's great.

02:33:21.260 --> 02:33:22.260
Yeah.

02:33:22.260 --> 02:33:23.260
I don't know.

02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:24.260
It's, it's weird.

02:33:24.260 --> 02:33:28.420
I think it's because the only thing they're not allowed to say is the only thing that

02:33:28.420 --> 02:33:32.660
would make any sense for any of them to say, which is just, you guys weren't supposed to

02:33:32.660 --> 02:33:34.780
actually do it.

02:33:34.780 --> 02:33:35.780
Yeah.

02:33:35.780 --> 02:33:37.980
This was about stealing your money.

02:33:37.980 --> 02:33:38.980
Yeah.

02:33:38.980 --> 02:33:40.380
And now look at us.

02:33:40.380 --> 02:33:41.540
This is tough for business.

02:33:41.540 --> 02:33:43.820
I'm disappointed in you.

02:33:43.820 --> 02:33:44.820
Yeah.

02:33:44.820 --> 02:33:45.820
Yeah.

02:33:45.820 --> 02:33:47.500
I it's, it's, it's weird.

02:33:47.500 --> 02:33:52.280
So in order to really thread the needle successfully, one of the things you have to do is cast dispersions

02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:55.500
on the people who actually did follow through with it.

02:33:55.500 --> 02:34:00.820
So there are people who have speculated that the Q shaman, a weirdo guy.

02:34:00.820 --> 02:34:02.620
He was a agent.

02:34:02.620 --> 02:34:03.620
He was Antifa.

02:34:03.620 --> 02:34:06.060
Yeah, come on buddy.

02:34:06.060 --> 02:34:07.540
Who else is Antifa?

02:34:07.540 --> 02:34:08.540
Give him more names.

02:34:08.540 --> 02:34:10.500
Uh, people are now in vet.

02:34:10.500 --> 02:34:17.080
Now looking into some of the people that have broken in, they're seeing a look suspiciously

02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:24.140
like a communist, uh, communist things we're seeing, uh, it was incredible shots from inside

02:34:24.140 --> 02:34:25.140
the Capitol dome.

02:34:25.140 --> 02:34:28.720
So there's a guy who had a tattoo that everyone thought was a hammer and a sickle and it turns

02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:30.900
out it's a symbol from like a video game dishonored.

02:34:30.900 --> 02:34:34.180
Um, so they were like, oh, he's a commie.

02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:35.900
He can't actually, this isn't really.

02:34:35.900 --> 02:34:36.900
Yeah.

02:34:36.900 --> 02:34:40.020
Oh, so he had Corvo's little tattoo on his hand.

02:34:40.020 --> 02:34:41.020
What a nerd.

02:34:41.020 --> 02:34:42.020
Dorks.

02:34:42.020 --> 02:34:43.020
That's so funny.

02:34:43.020 --> 02:34:47.820
Um, and yeah, but Nick Fuentes and Baked Alaska are figures.

02:34:47.820 --> 02:34:49.420
They're media figures.

02:34:49.420 --> 02:34:50.900
They were on your show.

02:34:50.900 --> 02:34:51.900
Yes.

02:34:51.900 --> 02:34:53.900
Nick Fuentes was on like a week ago.

02:34:53.900 --> 02:34:55.280
He was on a week ago.

02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:57.280
He was with you the last time you were in DC.

02:34:57.280 --> 02:34:59.280
Was he Antifa then or now?

02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:00.280
Pick one.

02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:01.280
Yeah.

02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:02.280
Yeah.

02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:03.280
They just conveniently ignore that.

02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:04.280
Jesus.

02:35:04.280 --> 02:35:05.280
What a bunch.

02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:06.280
Is he, he's going to be back on Infowars, right?

02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:07.280
Probably today.

02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:09.020
They're going to have to get Fuentes on soon.

02:35:09.020 --> 02:35:11.180
I don't know what happened on Thursday.

02:35:11.180 --> 02:35:12.180
Yeah.

02:35:12.180 --> 02:35:15.940
We're keeping this as a bottle episode of Wednesday and then on Monday we'll cover.

02:35:15.940 --> 02:35:16.940
We'll go from there.

02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:17.940
Yeah.

02:35:17.940 --> 02:35:18.940
Yeah.

02:35:18.940 --> 02:35:21.100
Just because of the stupidity of all this.

02:35:21.100 --> 02:35:22.100
So stupid.

02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:25.940
Um, but yeah, I would assume that at least by the time the weekend's over, Fuentes will

02:35:25.940 --> 02:35:31.260
have made some sort of a play for Harrison's job.

02:35:31.260 --> 02:35:39.380
Anyway, we end the Alex Jones show and we end up going into the war room.

02:35:39.380 --> 02:35:40.380
Smooth transition.

02:35:40.380 --> 02:35:41.380
Of course.

02:35:41.380 --> 02:35:42.580
It's all hosted by Harrison Smith.

02:35:42.580 --> 02:35:43.700
He has to leave.

02:35:43.700 --> 02:35:44.700
He's done.

02:35:44.700 --> 02:35:45.700
He's okay.

02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:46.700
He's tapped out.

02:35:46.700 --> 02:35:47.700
He's had a long day.

02:35:47.700 --> 02:35:48.700
Oh yeah.

02:35:48.700 --> 02:35:51.800
He's, I mean, to be fair, he was on air for a long time.

02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:52.800
Seven straight hours?

02:35:52.800 --> 02:35:58.740
He did hold up at least in terms of like not completely falling apart, which is faint praise,

02:35:58.740 --> 02:35:59.740
but I'll give it to him.

02:35:59.740 --> 02:36:00.740
I don't know.

02:36:00.740 --> 02:36:01.740
I don't think I could do seven hours.

02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:02.740
No.

02:36:02.740 --> 02:36:03.860
I don't think I, absolutely not.

02:36:03.860 --> 02:36:05.740
Especially this is an intense seven hours.

02:36:05.740 --> 02:36:08.060
I don't think he did a good job, but he did a job.

02:36:08.060 --> 02:36:09.060
Yeah.

02:36:09.060 --> 02:36:11.260
So I would've, I would've been like, guys, we shouldn't be doing this.

02:36:11.260 --> 02:36:12.700
This is not for us right now.

02:36:12.700 --> 02:36:13.900
We got to stop.

02:36:13.900 --> 02:36:19.500
Now what's really funny is that Alex, oh, and also, I mean, not to, not to add more

02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:22.180
praise on, but like Alex had said, we're cutting commercials.

02:36:22.180 --> 02:36:23.180
Yeah.

02:36:23.180 --> 02:36:27.180
So he had no breaks for like the last, like basically the last hour that he's been on

02:36:27.180 --> 02:36:28.180
air.

02:36:28.180 --> 02:36:29.180
God damn.

02:36:29.180 --> 02:36:30.180
But like, uh.

02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:31.180
Fuck you boss.

02:36:31.180 --> 02:36:33.180
Alex keeps saying, we're going to go into the fourth hour.

02:36:33.180 --> 02:36:35.840
Meanwhile, they're in the fourth hour.

02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:37.420
They're about to start the war room.

02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:40.220
He has no idea, but again, I could be.

02:36:40.220 --> 02:36:44.620
Time zones and, and he's, it's, there's a revolution going on.

02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:45.620
No, totally.

02:36:45.620 --> 02:36:46.620
I get it.

02:36:46.620 --> 02:36:47.620
Yeah.

02:36:47.620 --> 02:36:49.660
It's a little bit funny because you can hear the producer's voice like war room.

02:36:49.660 --> 02:36:50.660
Yeah.

02:36:50.660 --> 02:36:53.260
But I'm not, you know, I would make that mistake.

02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:54.260
Totally.

02:36:54.260 --> 02:36:55.260
No, that's understandable.

02:36:55.260 --> 02:36:56.260
For sure.

02:36:56.260 --> 02:37:01.380
Now with the mistake I would not make is Tom for a violent revolution, Tom Papert is hosting

02:37:01.380 --> 02:37:02.380
the war.

02:37:02.380 --> 02:37:03.380
Oh, that was a big mistake.

02:37:03.380 --> 02:37:04.380
And this guy sucks.

02:37:04.380 --> 02:37:07.900
Um, he's pretty scary.

02:37:07.900 --> 02:37:14.100
Uh, local news has reported that protesters have moved inside the Kansas, uh, uh, house

02:37:14.100 --> 02:37:15.260
chambers as well.

02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:19.580
I'm getting additional reports from Kentucky and Georgia that protesters are making their

02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:22.980
way inside the state Capitol buildings.

02:37:22.980 --> 02:37:28.620
What seems to have set this off of course is all of this happened mere seconds after

02:37:28.620 --> 02:37:33.540
Mike Pence announced his ultimate betrayal of president Trump and said that he would

02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:36.320
not fight for him in the electoral college.

02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:40.540
So I would say that everybody has like real different vibe.

02:37:40.540 --> 02:37:44.460
So that was because, so Pence is Antifa.

02:37:44.460 --> 02:37:45.460
Yes.

02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:47.220
He was the one who instigated this whole thing.

02:37:47.220 --> 02:37:56.020
Well here, here's, here's the vibe I would say, yeah, Harrison is like, yay, no, yay.

02:37:56.020 --> 02:37:57.020
That's where he's at.

02:37:57.020 --> 02:37:58.020
All right.

02:37:58.020 --> 02:38:02.340
He's watching this go down and he's like, this is the revolution, but he's also drastically

02:38:02.340 --> 02:38:05.700
affected in a kind of human way about the fact that someone died.

02:38:05.700 --> 02:38:06.700
That's true.

02:38:06.700 --> 02:38:08.980
And it, it, it ruins a lot of the vibe.

02:38:08.980 --> 02:38:10.340
It does hurt his feelings.

02:38:10.340 --> 02:38:11.340
Yeah.

02:38:11.340 --> 02:38:13.740
Uh, Tom Papert wants everything to burn.

02:38:13.740 --> 02:38:18.900
He does not think that he thinks this is great, but he also thinks that we need to do way

02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:19.900
more.

02:38:19.900 --> 02:38:20.900
Okay.

02:38:20.900 --> 02:38:21.900
Good.

02:38:21.900 --> 02:38:22.900
Good.

02:38:22.900 --> 02:38:23.900
It's he's, he's much more acceleration.

02:38:23.900 --> 02:38:24.900
All right, Tom.

02:38:24.900 --> 02:38:29.420
And then Alex can't quite figure out if it's Antifa or if he's glad.

02:38:29.420 --> 02:38:33.440
And Owen, I don't even know what the fuck he's on.

02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:34.440
Listen to this shit.

02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:36.220
Owen's talking to Tom Papert and like,

02:38:36.220 --> 02:38:44.700
hundreds of police cars never did they did it never did they do this once this summer

02:38:44.700 --> 02:38:48.740
when churches burned, buildings burned, businesses were looted.

02:38:48.740 --> 02:38:52.420
You never saw a response like this once, never once.

02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:54.660
Now you could, you could make an argument.

02:38:54.660 --> 02:38:58.680
I would even listen to an argument that says, oh, this is the appropriate response for what's

02:38:58.680 --> 02:38:59.680
happening today.

02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:00.680
I would listen to that.

02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:01.680
Great.

02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:03.620
Cause that's the argument I would make.

02:39:03.620 --> 02:39:06.700
It's the fucking Capitol building.

02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:11.580
It's it's people storming the fucking Capitol building of the country.

02:39:11.580 --> 02:39:16.260
So you could, you could make the argument that this is a very serious, real thing, much

02:39:16.260 --> 02:39:19.500
more so than someone stealing stuff from target.

02:39:19.500 --> 02:39:20.500
Yes.

02:39:20.500 --> 02:39:21.620
And I would listen to that argument.

02:39:21.620 --> 02:39:22.620
Convenient.

02:39:22.620 --> 02:39:23.620
Cause that's the argument I would make.

02:39:23.620 --> 02:39:24.620
Yeah.

02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:25.620
Yeah.

02:39:25.620 --> 02:39:27.460
Why would you tell me that you would listen to that argument?

02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:33.580
Cause it's the argument that really hurts your, obviously, obviously now, Hey, look,

02:39:33.580 --> 02:39:37.420
if you were to make the argument that this was real, I would agree with you.

02:39:37.420 --> 02:39:38.420
Yeah.

02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:39.420
But.

02:39:39.420 --> 02:39:42.500
Now even so I would say that some of the police responses that we've seen over the course

02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:44.700
of the summer were pretty severe.

02:39:44.700 --> 02:39:47.060
Oh no, no.

02:39:47.060 --> 02:39:48.060
How so?

02:39:48.060 --> 02:39:52.160
I don't, I don't want to get into a game with scale or playing that cause I don't actually

02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:58.660
think that I would be the most credible source on that, but I would say that there was a

02:39:58.660 --> 02:40:04.300
lot of police action against people before.

02:40:04.300 --> 02:40:12.700
And also whatever they did in terms of defending the Capitol building, you kind of would see

02:40:12.700 --> 02:40:15.060
it and be like, well, it's the Capitol building.

02:40:15.060 --> 02:40:20.460
Hey, we can talk about how many, how there were almost no arrests and all of that stuff.

02:40:20.460 --> 02:40:22.060
We can talk about that stuff.

02:40:22.060 --> 02:40:28.940
But I think what's a more telling statistic is how many fucking casualties there were

02:40:28.940 --> 02:40:30.300
far.

02:40:30.300 --> 02:40:33.840
There were fewer people with broken hands like that type of shit.

02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:36.660
Those types of, Oh, I got shot in the face with a rubber bullet.

02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:41.120
Oh, I got blood coming from my nose because I was hit by three fucking cops.

02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:43.460
There was none of that shit going around.

02:40:43.460 --> 02:40:47.180
It seems like there's less that I've heard of.

02:40:47.180 --> 02:40:48.180
Yeah.

02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:49.180
Yeah.

02:40:49.180 --> 02:40:54.540
I mean, it's, it, it's tough because obviously I don't think that the police should be, you

02:40:54.540 --> 02:40:55.540
know, or law enforcement.

02:40:55.540 --> 02:40:59.420
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not in the business of saying like, yeah, what'd you expect?

02:40:59.420 --> 02:41:00.620
I don't like that tone.

02:41:00.620 --> 02:41:02.580
Oh no, absolutely not.

02:41:02.580 --> 02:41:09.940
But had things gone differently over the summer and people had made it over that barricade

02:41:09.940 --> 02:41:12.900
when they were around the white house, sure.

02:41:12.900 --> 02:41:18.780
I would not have been super surprised if people got shot for trying to rush the white totally

02:41:18.780 --> 02:41:19.860
100%.

02:41:19.860 --> 02:41:24.600
I'm not saying that people should have been shot for rushing the Capitol building, but

02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:29.600
I'm saying I, what I am saying is I am not surprised by any level of law enforcement

02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:35.940
response when it comes to the fucking Capitol or the white house or, or I just don't understand

02:41:35.940 --> 02:41:37.540
why they're playing games with that.

02:41:37.540 --> 02:41:43.480
I think, I think that's one of the reasons that I'm just not as, uh, I, okay.

02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:48.700
When you, when Portland happened, you had fucking stormtroopers against people.

02:41:48.700 --> 02:41:53.100
And the pictures that came out were all in the middle of the night and everybody looked

02:41:53.100 --> 02:41:54.400
fucking cool.

02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:55.940
The cops looked cool.

02:41:55.940 --> 02:41:59.000
They looked like the fucking beasts from movies.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:00.600
They looked so strong.

02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:03.660
And the protesters, they were the protesters from movies.

02:42:03.660 --> 02:42:05.060
They looked so strong.

02:42:05.060 --> 02:42:09.980
And in this one we have cops standing around going like, Hey, what are you guys doing?

02:42:09.980 --> 02:42:12.720
We just got to let you guys get this out of your system.

02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:14.580
And we have idiots storming.

02:42:14.580 --> 02:42:19.400
We have people fucking putting their feet up on Nancy Pelosi's fucking desk.

02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:20.900
Some people might think that's pretty cool.

02:42:20.900 --> 02:42:23.660
It is cool, but it's also pathetic and stupid.

02:42:23.660 --> 02:42:27.540
I think, I think you're coming at this from a very subjective standpoint.

02:42:27.540 --> 02:42:28.540
I understand.

02:42:28.540 --> 02:42:29.540
I'm just saying.

02:42:29.540 --> 02:42:32.660
You have a particular view of what's cool and what kind of movies you like.

02:42:32.660 --> 02:42:35.300
No, no, that's, but they do too.

02:42:35.300 --> 02:42:39.480
These are people that are, that guy has a Corvo tattoo, Dan.

02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:42.720
These are all people who live in fucking fantasy movies.

02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:44.740
That's the guy who's hanging out with the shaman.

02:42:44.740 --> 02:42:50.100
Alex is their leader and he is, you know, like they're, these are all fucking sci-fi

02:42:50.100 --> 02:42:51.100
nerds.

02:42:51.100 --> 02:42:52.100
That is, that is true.

02:42:52.100 --> 02:42:57.100
It does seem like there's a lot of, yeah, that, um, but look, the bottom line is this

02:42:57.100 --> 02:42:58.100
was Antifa.

02:42:58.100 --> 02:42:59.100
Yeah.

02:42:59.100 --> 02:43:00.100
Okay.

02:43:00.100 --> 02:43:01.100
Alex.

02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:02.100
Alex is pretty sure of that.

02:43:02.100 --> 02:43:03.100
Okay.

02:43:03.100 --> 02:43:04.100
He's pretty much sure.

02:43:04.100 --> 02:43:05.100
Antifa started this.

02:43:05.100 --> 02:43:08.300
We're pretty much sure they're all wearing the same outfits, shoulder pads, knee pads,

02:43:08.300 --> 02:43:09.300
mask.

02:43:09.300 --> 02:43:10.300
Ooh.

02:43:10.300 --> 02:43:11.300
The people are pissed.

02:43:11.300 --> 02:43:12.300
They got them up there.

02:43:12.300 --> 02:43:15.340
A few people broke in, went in, could have arrested them, could have tasered them.

02:43:15.340 --> 02:43:16.340
Shouldn't have shot that woman.

02:43:16.340 --> 02:43:18.820
So they've already committed the big crime there.

02:43:18.820 --> 02:43:23.780
This does not need to escalate and we need to have our path to victory by exposing the

02:43:23.780 --> 02:43:26.700
fraudulent election with the massive evidence that came out.

02:43:26.700 --> 02:43:34.060
So Alex is really at like a point where he's like, let's deescalate and I honestly kind

02:43:34.060 --> 02:43:35.060
of get it.

02:43:35.060 --> 02:43:37.060
I get, I get his perspective.

02:43:37.060 --> 02:43:39.980
I mean, not because I agree.

02:43:39.980 --> 02:43:40.980
I do agree.

02:43:40.980 --> 02:43:41.980
There should have been deescalation.

02:43:41.980 --> 02:43:42.980
Sure.

02:43:42.980 --> 02:43:43.980
Sure.

02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:44.980
Sure.

02:43:44.980 --> 02:43:45.980
Sure.

02:43:45.980 --> 02:43:46.980
But I get where he's coming from and it became very clear as I listened on.

02:43:46.980 --> 02:43:47.980
What did that cap do?

02:43:47.980 --> 02:43:48.980
Sorry about the choppiness.

02:43:48.980 --> 02:43:49.980
That's not us.

02:43:49.980 --> 02:43:50.980
That's not us.

02:43:50.980 --> 02:43:51.980
That was the bad connection for Alex.

02:43:51.980 --> 02:43:52.980
Yeah.

02:43:52.980 --> 02:43:53.980
He said, don't fire on us.

02:43:53.980 --> 02:43:54.980
They're going to get one.

02:43:54.980 --> 02:43:55.980
And that's what this comes down to.

02:43:55.980 --> 02:43:56.980
And they just fired first.

02:43:56.980 --> 02:44:09.220
She met a woman in the neck and if she dies, that's on you.

02:44:09.220 --> 02:44:14.700
So Alex is justifying basically now a war on the government because they've taken first

02:44:14.700 --> 02:44:22.300
blood by shooting this woman, which I thought he had confirmed is just in the leg, but I

02:44:22.300 --> 02:44:24.100
guess that's not the case anymore.

02:44:24.100 --> 02:44:33.420
I would argue that if somebody who believed in violent conspiracy theories was encouraged

02:44:33.420 --> 02:44:38.980
to go to the mall and then stormed the Capitol building and was killed, that's probably more

02:44:38.980 --> 02:44:40.860
on people like Alex.

02:44:40.860 --> 02:44:46.780
I think it's tough because people have such similar information streams that are very

02:44:46.780 --> 02:44:47.780
separate.

02:44:47.780 --> 02:44:49.100
That's why I said people like Alex.

02:44:49.100 --> 02:44:50.100
Exactly.

02:44:50.100 --> 02:44:51.100
Yeah, yeah.

02:44:51.100 --> 02:44:52.100
It's that sphere.

02:44:52.100 --> 02:44:53.100
It's the whole sphere.

02:44:53.100 --> 02:44:54.100
Yeah.

02:44:54.100 --> 02:44:55.100
It's decentralized.

02:44:55.100 --> 02:44:59.300
Her death is on the right wing media ecosystem.

02:44:59.300 --> 02:45:00.300
Yeah.

02:45:00.300 --> 02:45:05.620
It's hard to personalize responsibility or to make it like, Alex, you did this because

02:45:05.620 --> 02:45:09.740
it's kind of nebulous and impossible to nail down.

02:45:09.740 --> 02:45:10.740
Totally.

02:45:10.740 --> 02:45:19.300
But yeah, it does feel to me that you look at what is most responsible for the circumstances

02:45:19.300 --> 02:45:20.680
that lead to this.

02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:26.780
It's people believing in a fictional reality and there's a lot of people who are responsible

02:45:26.780 --> 02:45:34.640
for creating, reinforcing, worsening those things and Alex is certainly one of them.

02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:37.700
Everybody on Fox News should be fucking slapped.

02:45:37.700 --> 02:45:40.880
If they say anything about...

02:45:40.880 --> 02:45:45.220
You can hear them saying shit that people on Fox News said two days before, so it's

02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:46.960
on you.

02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:49.860
Everybody there should have been slapped in the face while it was going on.

02:45:49.860 --> 02:45:52.100
It's your fucking fault.

02:45:52.100 --> 02:45:54.560
But now, Alex wants you to deescalate.

02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:56.920
He wants everyone to go home.

02:45:56.920 --> 02:45:57.920
Such a surprise.

02:45:57.920 --> 02:45:58.920
It's time to go home.

02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:03.220
I would advise everybody who happens to be watching down there on our feeds, go home

02:46:03.220 --> 02:46:08.620
now, because we're not the bad guys that are instigating this and I don't want you to get

02:46:08.620 --> 02:46:09.620
hurt.

02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:10.620
Okay?

02:46:10.620 --> 02:46:12.180
The globalists know they're losing.

02:46:12.180 --> 02:46:15.980
They want to show some type of decisive force like Trump's bad, like we started this.

02:46:15.980 --> 02:46:21.500
We need to deescalate this and people need to then decide, okay, and then watch what

02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:26.540
happens and let them have the debate and let them have the process that we were starting

02:46:26.540 --> 02:46:30.220
to win of showing the fraud, okay?

02:46:30.220 --> 02:46:33.700
That's why they activated the provocateurs to trigger this, I believe, and we have witnesses

02:46:33.700 --> 02:46:35.680
and it looks just like antifa.

02:46:35.680 --> 02:46:40.360
So the reason that Alex is saying everyone go home, deescalate, is because he has what

02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:41.940
he thinks he needs.

02:46:41.940 --> 02:46:48.840
He thinks that everything that he was hoping to accomplish, and trying to make lemonade

02:46:48.840 --> 02:46:53.860
out of the lemons that life has given him, obviously the most profitable route is continuing

02:46:53.860 --> 02:46:57.940
just the terrorist edging game that he constantly does.

02:46:57.940 --> 02:46:59.680
That's super manageable for him.

02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:02.540
But now that this has happened, it's tough.

02:47:02.540 --> 02:47:08.540
But on the bright side, Alex doesn't realize that Congress will just reconvene in the evening

02:47:08.540 --> 02:47:10.940
and certify the election results.

02:47:10.940 --> 02:47:16.140
So he thinks that there's a stay of execution that's going on here.

02:47:16.140 --> 02:47:23.740
Simultaneously, he has this woman who has been killed by the police that he believes

02:47:23.740 --> 02:47:27.340
he can build a martyr narrative out of.

02:47:27.340 --> 02:47:31.900
He has all of the optics that he needs to build upon, move forward.

02:47:31.900 --> 02:47:37.500
He's decided that this is antifa and he's going to put it on the left.

02:47:37.500 --> 02:47:41.280
He has everything that he needs as long as it doesn't get worse.

02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:44.020
And so that's what he's encouraging people to do.

02:47:44.020 --> 02:47:47.060
He has no real effect on anyone's actions, I don't believe.

02:47:47.060 --> 02:47:48.980
No, no, no, absolutely not.

02:47:48.980 --> 02:47:50.620
But it's...

02:47:50.620 --> 02:47:55.100
Imagine somebody in the Capitol building after having stormed it like, hold on, I got word

02:47:55.100 --> 02:47:57.540
from Alex, we all got to go home, guys.

02:47:57.540 --> 02:48:00.820
Hold on, guys, I'm listening to the very highly rated War Room program.

02:48:00.820 --> 02:48:01.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:48:01.820 --> 02:48:03.540
Wait, I thought that one was in DC.

02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:05.340
Yeah, Tom Pappertoasting today.

02:48:05.340 --> 02:48:08.180
Ooh, turn it off.

02:48:08.180 --> 02:48:14.220
So one of the dead giveaways that Alex is just like, listen, we can't let this get worse

02:48:14.220 --> 02:48:15.580
is this.

02:48:15.580 --> 02:48:20.860
I would advise all the great people down here to understand we are contesting, we are fighting,

02:48:20.860 --> 02:48:22.260
we've not reached this point yet.

02:48:22.260 --> 02:48:24.980
I would advise people to get off the streets by six o'clock tonight.

02:48:24.980 --> 02:48:27.540
Alex is telling people to accept a curfew.

02:48:27.540 --> 02:48:28.540
Yeah.

02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:29.540
What?

02:48:29.540 --> 02:48:34.820
Hey, you know what happens when your revolutionary movement is led by a bunch of rich people

02:48:34.820 --> 02:48:43.560
and grifters and scam artists and your supreme leader is a fucking coward asking vice presidents

02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:48.440
to overthrow a country for him, and then he decided to run away.

02:48:48.440 --> 02:48:54.260
He ran away, he fleed from your overthrow capital attack.

02:48:54.260 --> 02:48:59.860
And then your hero anti-government guy tells you, hey, listen to the state when they tell

02:48:59.860 --> 02:49:01.380
you to go home at a certain time.

02:49:01.380 --> 02:49:02.380
Yeah, totally.

02:49:02.380 --> 02:49:03.380
Listen to that curfew.

02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:04.980
Hey, you know who we're fighting?

02:49:04.980 --> 02:49:07.140
The literal Christian devil.

02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:09.140
But nightfall.

02:49:09.140 --> 02:49:10.740
We only fight in the day.

02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:16.100
Now, I have been spending a lot of time on my program yelling about how, you know, curfews

02:49:16.100 --> 02:49:19.460
are basically, you know, that and masks are basically slavery.

02:49:19.460 --> 02:49:20.460
Yeah, just slavery.

02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:21.460
Government overreach.

02:49:21.460 --> 02:49:22.460
Go home by six.

02:49:22.460 --> 02:49:23.460
Well, it's six.

02:49:23.460 --> 02:49:25.540
Yeah, it's nightfall guys.

02:49:25.540 --> 02:49:27.540
Gotta go home.

02:49:27.540 --> 02:49:29.100
This is actually kind of interesting.

02:49:29.100 --> 02:49:33.780
At this point, Alex reports that this woman who was shot has died.

02:49:33.780 --> 02:49:34.780
This is way before.

02:49:34.780 --> 02:49:37.020
Yeah, I was going to say, we didn't find that out.

02:49:37.020 --> 02:49:38.020
No.

02:49:38.020 --> 02:49:39.020
No.

02:49:39.020 --> 02:49:40.020
We got really bad news.

02:49:40.020 --> 02:49:41.020
Try to get her name.

02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:45.620
Is that from our police sources or is that, that's exclusive.

02:49:45.620 --> 02:49:51.100
Guys, the woman that they shot looks like some type of security for the senators.

02:49:51.100 --> 02:49:53.260
The woman they shot died.

02:49:53.260 --> 02:49:56.540
So the woman who shot on the screen, she's dead.

02:49:56.540 --> 02:49:58.900
I gotta go talk to our folks.

02:49:58.900 --> 02:50:01.380
We got DC police that we've got hired off duty.

02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:04.740
So I gotta give you the latest stuff and they're talking to Capitol Police right now.

02:50:04.740 --> 02:50:08.860
I don't know what to make of this because it did end up being correct.

02:50:08.860 --> 02:50:09.860
Right.

02:50:09.860 --> 02:50:12.180
But I still don't think Alex had a source on that.

02:50:12.180 --> 02:50:14.140
I think that was just a good bet.

02:50:14.140 --> 02:50:15.140
Yeah.

02:50:15.140 --> 02:50:19.060
I think he knew that there was a good chance she was going to pass and decided to make

02:50:19.060 --> 02:50:21.700
it definitive, claim there was a source.

02:50:21.700 --> 02:50:22.700
Yeah.

02:50:22.700 --> 02:50:23.700
Yeah.

02:50:23.700 --> 02:50:27.860
Up until that point, all the confirmed reports were very much like...

02:50:27.860 --> 02:50:28.860
Nonsense.

02:50:28.860 --> 02:50:29.860
Well, I mean...

02:50:29.860 --> 02:50:33.660
Oh, I meant confirmed reports that Alex is saying.

02:50:33.660 --> 02:50:34.660
The real world.

02:50:34.660 --> 02:50:35.660
Right.

02:50:35.660 --> 02:50:36.660
Right.

02:50:36.660 --> 02:50:42.160
The reporting was like, we saw her get this type of medical treatment, which they only

02:50:42.160 --> 02:50:46.140
give in the most extreme of circumstances.

02:50:46.140 --> 02:50:47.620
So it would be surprising.

02:50:47.620 --> 02:50:48.620
Critical condition.

02:50:48.620 --> 02:50:49.620
Yeah.

02:50:49.620 --> 02:50:50.620
Yeah.

02:50:50.620 --> 02:50:51.620
So it would be, it's a good bet.

02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:52.620
It's not, I doubt he knew.

02:50:52.620 --> 02:50:53.620
Yeah.

02:50:53.620 --> 02:50:57.300
When I said that the confirmed reports are nonsense, I mean the things that Alex has

02:50:57.300 --> 02:50:59.020
tried to pass off as confirmed reports.

02:50:59.020 --> 02:51:00.020
Yes, exactly.

02:51:00.020 --> 02:51:01.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:51:01.020 --> 02:51:02.020
Totally.

02:51:02.020 --> 02:51:03.020
We just had a misunderstanding.

02:51:03.020 --> 02:51:04.020
Yeah, totally.

02:51:04.020 --> 02:51:05.020
We got to crossfire.

02:51:05.020 --> 02:51:08.420
So Alex, now in light of this decision that he's made, or maybe somebody has given him

02:51:08.420 --> 02:51:13.100
a tip that she has passed, now we need to set the narrative.

02:51:13.100 --> 02:51:17.900
I see it in fullwars.com, I'm not mad, we're just directing live from the air, that it

02:51:17.900 --> 02:51:20.100
still says, watch live.

02:51:20.100 --> 02:51:24.500
Today's the day Alex Jones leads largest Patriot movement in history through DC.

02:51:24.500 --> 02:51:32.420
Let's update that, that DC now under martial law, feds murder innocent woman, Pence turns

02:51:32.420 --> 02:51:33.420
against Trump.

02:51:33.420 --> 02:51:34.420
Okay.

02:51:34.420 --> 02:51:38.300
Let me give you that one again.

02:51:38.300 --> 02:51:39.300
Okay.

02:51:39.300 --> 02:51:40.300
Okay.

02:51:40.300 --> 02:51:48.940
DC now under martial law, feds shoot and kill innocent woman.

02:51:48.940 --> 02:51:51.020
Pence turns against Trump.

02:51:51.020 --> 02:51:54.060
We have to get the narrative out of the truth of them killing this woman.

02:51:54.060 --> 02:51:56.020
You got to get the narrative out.

02:51:56.020 --> 02:51:58.300
This is the narrative that we need to set.

02:51:58.300 --> 02:52:02.220
Pence is now the bad guy, the cops murdered this woman in cold blood, and the city is

02:52:02.220 --> 02:52:03.840
under martial law.

02:52:03.840 --> 02:52:07.700
And of course the sub-narratives, of course the martial law was precipitated by false

02:52:07.700 --> 02:52:13.500
flag, takeover of the Capitol building, it was provocateured by Antifa.

02:52:13.500 --> 02:52:16.220
Fight the power, but also go home at six.

02:52:16.220 --> 02:52:17.220
Yeah.

02:52:17.220 --> 02:52:20.500
Pence is trying to make this work and it's just pathetic.

02:52:20.500 --> 02:52:28.580
So he has some footage of this shooting and he constantly describes it as execution style.

02:52:28.580 --> 02:52:30.740
And again, that's just the narrative that's being set.

02:52:30.740 --> 02:52:31.740
I saw the video.

02:52:31.740 --> 02:52:34.980
I just want the footage of them execute the woman.

02:52:34.980 --> 02:52:37.300
They just walk up and shoot her right in the neck.

02:52:37.300 --> 02:52:41.380
A nonviolent woman wasn't even the woman trying to break through the glass, they just execute

02:52:41.380 --> 02:52:42.380
her.

02:52:42.380 --> 02:52:45.060
And they're the good guys and it's Trump's fault, it's our fault.

02:52:45.060 --> 02:52:49.060
No, it's your fault, globalist, and if you want to fight, you're gonna fucking get one,

02:52:49.060 --> 02:52:50.700
you got that?

02:52:50.700 --> 02:52:51.700
Fucking bullies.

02:52:51.700 --> 02:52:52.700
So, yeah.

02:52:52.700 --> 02:52:53.700
Fucking bullies.

02:52:53.700 --> 02:52:58.380
I have unfortunately also seen this video, I did not want to, but Alex plays it a bunch

02:52:58.380 --> 02:53:06.320
of times, and it seems very clear that he has made a point to have everyone say that

02:53:06.320 --> 02:53:14.180
this was execution, because that term is now used almost blanketly.

02:53:14.180 --> 02:53:18.020
And get this, this is weird, Alex has found a first-hand witness.

02:53:18.020 --> 02:53:22.340
We're gonna, in a couple of minutes, we're gonna have Pepper take over, because we've

02:53:22.340 --> 02:53:27.020
got a guest that was one of the first to go in today that witnessed it all, so stay there.

02:53:27.020 --> 02:53:30.820
So we're gonna have an eyewitness guest that was in the building and witnessed the whole

02:53:30.820 --> 02:53:32.260
thing, but we now have it confirmed.

02:53:32.260 --> 02:53:36.940
Oh my god, what a shock, we got a witness, we got a first-hand witness.

02:53:36.940 --> 02:53:43.040
You don't get to tell me that you're revolting and overthrowing the government, and then

02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:48.980
be like, oh, this innocent woman was murdered in cold blood by the cops.

02:53:48.980 --> 02:53:53.420
No, you said you're fighting a revolution, people die in a revolution.

02:53:53.420 --> 02:54:01.300
Or conversely, Antifa provocateur'd things, and then she wouldn't be, I don't understand.

02:54:01.300 --> 02:54:04.860
So if she's not- It's hard.

02:54:04.860 --> 02:54:07.340
It's hard to figure out exactly what the narrative is.

02:54:07.340 --> 02:54:12.660
Basically they're all false flag provocateurs except for her, she was a hero, and I don't

02:54:12.660 --> 02:54:13.660
know.

02:54:13.660 --> 02:54:19.700
Yeah, see, I can care that she was killed, because I'm living in the real world where

02:54:19.700 --> 02:54:25.700
what happened was a woman's brain was destroyed and melted, and then here we are.

02:54:25.700 --> 02:54:30.580
But they can't care, because they're fighting a real fucking war against the devil.

02:54:30.580 --> 02:54:34.580
They should all be expecting to die immediately.

02:54:34.580 --> 02:54:37.900
That's what, you're fighting the literal Christian devil.

02:54:37.900 --> 02:54:42.380
Yeah, and- Don't hand-ring about one person dying.

02:54:42.380 --> 02:54:49.460
It does seem weird, and it also seems weird to go halfway in terms of we have breached

02:54:49.460 --> 02:54:53.980
the Capitol building and be like, we'll fight another day.

02:54:53.980 --> 02:54:59.620
It seems weird, if you think that you're up against the actual devil, you're already midstream.

02:54:59.620 --> 02:55:00.620
It's very weird.

02:55:00.620 --> 02:55:01.740
No, it's pathetic.

02:55:01.740 --> 02:55:04.580
But that's because that's not really what they want.

02:55:04.580 --> 02:55:06.620
They don't want that.

02:55:06.620 --> 02:55:09.780
It's like what you were saying, the people who they're probably the most mad at are the

02:55:09.780 --> 02:55:12.920
people who followed through with what they keep saying should be done.

02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:15.260
We want your money.

02:55:15.260 --> 02:55:17.220
We don't actually want a Ron Paul presidency.

02:55:17.220 --> 02:55:19.980
Do you realize what would happen if that shit happened?

02:55:19.980 --> 02:55:22.500
We would lose our money.

02:55:22.500 --> 02:55:28.100
So Tom Papert hosts for a little while, and this is just, he's doing the work to build

02:55:28.100 --> 02:55:31.660
up this narrative that this woman was a martyr.

02:55:31.660 --> 02:55:36.860
I will completely admit that I am a chauvinist, and I forced all of our female reporters on

02:55:36.860 --> 02:55:39.060
the ground to get the hell out of there.

02:55:39.060 --> 02:55:42.180
Everyone is on a train getting multiple states away right now.

02:55:42.180 --> 02:55:43.780
This is not a safe place.

02:55:43.780 --> 02:55:50.260
These are the times that try many souls, and this is, it's not the time to be a martyr.

02:55:50.260 --> 02:55:54.660
They've already made a martyr, and that is what this young woman will be.

02:55:54.660 --> 02:56:00.980
The police shot and killed a woman because they didn't like her form of protest.

02:56:00.980 --> 02:56:03.500
I'd say...

02:56:03.500 --> 02:56:08.820
I mean, if your form of protest is storming the Capitol building, I would argue, yeah!

02:56:08.820 --> 02:56:09.820
Yeah!

02:56:09.820 --> 02:56:10.820
Yeah!

02:56:10.820 --> 02:56:11.820
So, um...

02:56:11.820 --> 02:56:15.940
This is all the martyr, this is, now is not the time to martyr yourself.

02:56:15.940 --> 02:56:17.780
Obviously we're fighting the devil.

02:56:17.780 --> 02:56:18.780
Yeah.

02:56:18.780 --> 02:56:25.860
I'm going to tell you that I have some real negative feelings about how Alex handles the

02:56:25.860 --> 02:56:30.500
fact that he has footage of this shooting.

02:56:30.500 --> 02:56:38.260
But there's a really interesting dynamic at play about the provenance of this footage.

02:56:38.260 --> 02:56:45.620
And Alex kind of reveals too much, and then it pretends that he didn't say these things.

02:56:45.620 --> 02:56:50.180
I have seen a snuff film today.

02:56:50.180 --> 02:56:55.280
I just saw footage of an innocent woman that one of our own cameramen followed the crowds

02:56:55.280 --> 02:57:01.380
into the Senate, and I watched them execute an unarmed woman with a Trump flag shooting

02:57:01.380 --> 02:57:04.380
her in the neck at point blank range.

02:57:04.380 --> 02:57:06.660
We are uploading the footage right now.

02:57:06.660 --> 02:57:10.900
So one of your camera people, one of your employees, was one of the people who was along

02:57:10.900 --> 02:57:17.260
storming the Senate and was there close enough to get this video of this woman being shot.

02:57:17.260 --> 02:57:18.260
Yeah.

02:57:18.260 --> 02:57:19.260
Interesting.

02:57:19.260 --> 02:57:20.260
Yeah.

02:57:20.260 --> 02:57:21.260
So that is what he's saying.

02:57:21.260 --> 02:57:22.260
Yeah.

02:57:22.260 --> 02:57:23.260
Weird.

02:57:23.260 --> 02:57:26.980
You would think that the psycho, like, and we had a cameraman in there, all of a sudden

02:57:26.980 --> 02:57:32.020
everybody around him would just go, ee, ee, ee, ee, stabbing him through the fucking neck.

02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:33.020
Yeah.

02:57:33.020 --> 02:57:34.020
Alex, that hurts, that hurts.

02:57:34.020 --> 02:57:35.020
Don't do that.

02:57:35.020 --> 02:57:36.020
Don't do this.

02:57:36.020 --> 02:57:40.500
The cameraman is freaking out about the criminals in Congress, and I don't, I just think this

02:57:40.500 --> 02:57:44.160
is a little, I think I kept this clip because it's so out of place.

02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:45.160
It's a weird outburst.

02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:46.160
Okay.

02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:49.380
And this is the biggest frustration, and this is why this is so difficult, why we're on

02:57:49.380 --> 02:57:50.980
a high wire here.

02:57:50.980 --> 02:57:52.340
We're not at war with the police.

02:57:52.340 --> 02:57:53.540
I don't look at the police like my enemy.

02:57:53.540 --> 02:57:54.540
I don't look at Antifa like my enemy.

02:57:54.540 --> 02:57:55.540
Look, they're choosing the wrong side.

02:57:55.540 --> 02:57:59.980
I don't look like BLM is my enemy, but man, the fucking criminals are sitting in that

02:57:59.980 --> 02:58:04.020
fucking building, taking my fucking country, and I'm fucking sick of it, man.

02:58:04.020 --> 02:58:05.660
And these people are too.

02:58:05.660 --> 02:58:06.660
That's all.

02:58:06.660 --> 02:58:09.460
And you guys just keep killing women and stuff and see what happens.

02:58:09.460 --> 02:58:10.460
Yep.

02:58:10.460 --> 02:58:11.460
You're damn right.

02:58:11.460 --> 02:58:14.620
Because they take our kindness for weakness.

02:58:14.620 --> 02:58:18.860
So now they're on top of a building, I think, at a like a press location.

02:58:18.860 --> 02:58:19.860
Okay.

02:58:19.860 --> 02:58:20.860
So like, I don't...

02:58:20.860 --> 02:58:25.020
This sounds like three dudes at a bar arguing about how they fucking lost, and they're like,

02:58:25.020 --> 02:58:28.140
no, no, no, we won the game, we'll get them next time.

02:58:28.140 --> 02:58:31.220
It's really hard to tell, but that was bizarre.

02:58:31.220 --> 02:58:32.220
Yeah.

02:58:32.220 --> 02:58:33.980
So anyway, Rob Doo is there too.

02:58:33.980 --> 02:58:34.980
He's hanging out.

02:58:34.980 --> 02:58:35.980
Of course.

02:58:35.980 --> 02:58:36.980
He's watched this death film.

02:58:36.980 --> 02:58:37.980
Yeah, I just watched it a couple times.

02:58:37.980 --> 02:58:38.980
It's pretty sad.

02:58:38.980 --> 02:58:39.980
She's climbing...

02:58:39.980 --> 02:58:40.980
Why don't you come here?

02:58:40.980 --> 02:58:41.980
Come here.

02:58:41.980 --> 02:58:42.980
Come here.

02:58:42.980 --> 02:58:43.980
Okay.

02:58:43.980 --> 02:58:44.980
I understand you just watched it.

02:58:44.980 --> 02:58:46.460
When is the network going to have it?

02:58:46.460 --> 02:58:47.460
They have it.

02:58:47.460 --> 02:58:48.460
They have it now.

02:58:48.460 --> 02:58:52.740
I'm not ready to show it yet, because I want to give viewer discretion's advice.

02:58:52.740 --> 02:58:53.740
Describe what...

02:58:53.740 --> 02:58:58.140
We're going to show you the HD footage in a minute of the execution.

02:58:58.140 --> 02:59:05.900
So Alex's big take on this is that the media and the news played the police footage of

02:59:05.900 --> 02:59:08.100
the killing of George Floyd.

02:59:08.100 --> 02:59:09.100
Yeah.

02:59:09.100 --> 02:59:10.900
And so he's like, well, I'm going to play this.

02:59:10.900 --> 02:59:12.900
I want you to watch it.

02:59:12.900 --> 02:59:17.900
I want it next hour, because we're going to slow it down so you get to see her, because

02:59:17.900 --> 02:59:22.220
like George Floyd, that thing on his neck, and he's ODing on heroin.

02:59:22.220 --> 02:59:23.220
It's a terrible thing.

02:59:23.220 --> 02:59:25.740
The cops are in the wrong, but they didn't do it on purpose.

02:59:25.740 --> 02:59:26.900
This is on purpose.

02:59:26.900 --> 02:59:31.700
I want you to see her die slow, because believe me, if she was still here and she's with God

02:59:31.700 --> 02:59:38.660
now, she'd want to be seen for what she did, executed while she was just trying to execute

02:59:38.660 --> 02:59:39.660
her own first amendment.

02:59:39.660 --> 02:59:43.580
So we're going to play the footage raw next hour.

02:59:43.580 --> 02:59:46.300
That's psychologically so fucked up.

02:59:46.300 --> 02:59:49.940
I want you to watch her die slow.

02:59:49.940 --> 02:59:52.280
That's so gross.

02:59:52.280 --> 02:59:53.620
She would have wanted me.

02:59:53.620 --> 02:59:56.240
You don't even know who this person is.

02:59:56.240 --> 03:00:01.940
I mean, you can guess some things about her based on the fact that she stormed the Capitol.

03:00:01.940 --> 03:00:03.340
But those would be weak assumptions.

03:00:03.340 --> 03:00:04.340
They wouldn't be great.

03:00:04.340 --> 03:00:05.500
They wouldn't be great.

03:00:05.500 --> 03:00:07.380
But Tom Pappert is doing his job.

03:00:07.380 --> 03:00:11.620
Alex has declared this an execution, and so while he's hosting, he's really trying to

03:00:11.620 --> 03:00:12.620
push that.

03:00:12.620 --> 03:00:20.620
Again, Infowars has exclusive video of the martyr of DC, the MAGA martyr who was executed

03:00:20.620 --> 03:00:22.220
Shawn execution style.

03:00:22.220 --> 03:00:23.300
I've seen the video.

03:00:23.300 --> 03:00:33.180
I don't know what else you call it by these jackboots of Muriel Bowser by the jackboots

03:00:33.180 --> 03:00:34.380
of Joe Biden.

03:00:34.380 --> 03:00:36.020
Joe Biden's jackboots.

03:00:36.020 --> 03:00:37.420
You fucking nerds.

03:00:37.420 --> 03:00:38.420
Yeah.

03:00:38.420 --> 03:00:39.420
Get the fuck out of here.

03:00:39.420 --> 03:00:40.420
Call them Koopa Troopas.

03:00:40.420 --> 03:00:41.420
Yeah.

03:00:41.420 --> 03:00:42.420
No kidding.

03:00:42.420 --> 03:00:43.580
The jackboots.

03:00:43.580 --> 03:00:45.140
Her name is Bowser.

03:00:45.140 --> 03:00:46.140
Make use of it.

03:00:46.140 --> 03:00:48.140
Good God.

03:00:48.140 --> 03:00:52.700
So anyway, Pappert also let slip that the person who got this footage is employed by

03:00:52.700 --> 03:00:53.900
Infowars.

03:00:53.900 --> 03:01:00.340
I know the Infowars cameraman who was in the room who captured the footage when it happened.

03:01:00.340 --> 03:01:01.340
Say his name out loud.

03:01:01.340 --> 03:01:02.340
I hope the man is okay.

03:01:02.340 --> 03:01:05.780
He's a strong man, but I don't know if I would be.

03:01:05.780 --> 03:01:12.540
So Tom Pappert is playing some clips, responding to them, and at this point, there's a group

03:01:12.540 --> 03:01:19.700
of Trump supporters who find a media set up, and they start attacking the lights and what

03:01:19.700 --> 03:01:20.700
have you.

03:01:20.700 --> 03:01:21.700
I haven't seen any violence, though.

03:01:21.700 --> 03:01:22.900
None.

03:01:22.900 --> 03:01:27.380
But what's really funny here is that I was watching this, and Tom Pappert is playing

03:01:27.380 --> 03:01:32.300
this video, and he has to pretend that he can't see Trump flags.

03:01:32.300 --> 03:01:35.460
It's so pathetic.

03:01:35.460 --> 03:01:41.940
More clashes happening, it appears, between the media and Trump supporters.

03:01:41.940 --> 03:01:42.940
Or is that the left?

03:01:42.940 --> 03:01:48.260
I can't tell what kind of flag that is, but more clashes happening in DC as the sun starts

03:01:48.260 --> 03:01:49.260
to go down a little bit.

03:01:49.260 --> 03:01:53.940
Things are gonna get a little bit darker, Antifa will come out, those appear to be lights.

03:01:53.940 --> 03:01:58.100
Looks like somebody was maybe doing a stand up, some news outlet was doing a stand up.

03:01:58.100 --> 03:02:00.860
That's just dumb as well.

03:02:00.860 --> 03:02:05.600
To the media, to my friends in the media, I've given my reporters, and we are the renegade

03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:09.940
news outlet that is doing this by the seat of our pants.

03:02:09.940 --> 03:02:11.420
I told my people, go home.

03:02:11.420 --> 03:02:15.380
I told my people, nobody's gonna get shot today on my watch.

03:02:15.380 --> 03:02:21.740
Mainstream media journalists who are out there to get the footage to make us look bad, you're

03:02:21.740 --> 03:02:25.060
not safe for Antifa or police either, I'm sorry.

03:02:25.060 --> 03:02:26.960
That's not a threat, that's an observation.

03:02:26.960 --> 03:02:27.960
No it's not a threat.

03:02:27.960 --> 03:02:30.020
Because these people are feral.

03:02:30.020 --> 03:02:31.780
I think you might need to go to therapy.

03:02:31.780 --> 03:02:36.160
I, okay, here's the problem, here's the problem, alright, okay.

03:02:36.160 --> 03:02:40.600
Here's why that's so obviously transparently bullshit.

03:02:40.600 --> 03:02:47.820
Because if they were Antifa provocateurs, they would still be carrying Trump flags.

03:02:47.820 --> 03:02:50.420
They wouldn't be carrying Antifa flags.

03:02:50.420 --> 03:02:52.580
Oh yeah, that's true.

03:02:52.580 --> 03:02:53.580
That's a great point.

03:02:53.580 --> 03:02:54.580
Yeah.

03:02:54.580 --> 03:02:55.580
Also, based on-

03:02:55.580 --> 03:02:56.580
Everything else.

03:02:56.580 --> 03:03:01.860
Based on what Tom Papert is describing, conflict journalism should not exist.

03:03:01.860 --> 03:03:02.860
I can't-

03:03:02.860 --> 03:03:07.340
Hey look, look, I understand everyone's curious what's going on in a war zone, but you journalists

03:03:07.340 --> 03:03:08.700
are fucking stupid.

03:03:08.700 --> 03:03:15.420
Hey, hey, journalists, the cops in Antifa are gonna, they're not your friends and they're

03:03:15.420 --> 03:03:17.140
gonna come after you too.

03:03:17.140 --> 03:03:19.040
No, no they're not.

03:03:19.040 --> 03:03:20.700
You guys are.

03:03:20.700 --> 03:03:28.620
So something bad happens on this broadcast and that is they've been teasing this death

03:03:28.620 --> 03:03:35.940
footage that they're gonna play, viewer discretion advised, but they get scooped, someone else

03:03:35.940 --> 03:03:36.940
releases it.

03:03:36.940 --> 03:03:37.940
Oh no.

03:03:37.940 --> 03:03:42.780
We will be going live here in just a second with Alex Jones, he's going to come in and

03:03:42.780 --> 03:03:43.780
break the video.

03:03:43.780 --> 03:03:47.940
Sorry, it's just my cry who was telling them do not upload this video anywhere, it is an

03:03:47.940 --> 03:03:50.980
Info Wars exclusive and then all of a sudden I'm seeing it go up.

03:03:50.980 --> 03:03:52.220
So not sure what happened there.

03:03:52.220 --> 03:03:53.540
Yep, someone else got the footage.

03:03:53.540 --> 03:03:54.540
Somebody else got there first.

03:03:54.540 --> 03:04:00.020
Some other dude, Michael Codray, I think, a guy from Stop a Steal, got the footage and

03:04:00.020 --> 03:04:02.440
he uploaded it and got scooped.

03:04:02.440 --> 03:04:03.980
No longer an Info Wars exclusive.

03:04:03.980 --> 03:04:05.100
Oh, poor guys.

03:04:05.100 --> 03:04:07.020
They can still get Rob Doo though.

03:04:07.020 --> 03:04:08.020
Yes.

03:04:08.020 --> 03:04:09.020
I don't know.

03:04:09.020 --> 03:04:10.020
He might be in the wind.

03:04:10.020 --> 03:04:13.020
He might be too high enough.

03:04:13.020 --> 03:04:22.460
So I noticed there are similarities in how Harrison is aping traits and patterns that

03:04:22.460 --> 03:04:24.700
Alex Jones does.

03:04:24.700 --> 03:04:25.700
In-house style.

03:04:25.700 --> 03:04:26.700
Exactly.

03:04:26.700 --> 03:04:33.060
And I noticed one that Tom Papert is doing an impression of, or just basically Alex does

03:04:33.060 --> 03:04:38.660
it so it's totally fine, and that is reporting something based on imagining it.

03:04:38.660 --> 03:04:42.840
I guarantee you as we speak right now, they're trying to use the 25th Amendment to remove

03:04:42.840 --> 03:04:46.580
Trump and do a full and complete and total coup right before our eyes.

03:04:46.580 --> 03:04:50.240
I guarantee you that's the conversation and Mike Pence is leading it.

03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:54.020
I can almost, this is without sources, I'm just telling you I know how these people think.

03:04:54.020 --> 03:04:57.340
I've spent enough time covering them like Alex Jones has, not nearly as much as him,

03:04:57.340 --> 03:04:59.180
but you figure it out pretty quick, they're sick.

03:04:59.180 --> 03:05:03.860
I'm making this up and I guarantee you because I know I've followed these people for so long

03:05:03.860 --> 03:05:07.660
they're sick and I know what they're doing and it's all just based on nothing.

03:05:07.660 --> 03:05:08.940
Just feels so true though.

03:05:08.940 --> 03:05:09.940
Yeah.

03:05:09.940 --> 03:05:10.940
So true.

03:05:10.940 --> 03:05:11.940
This is a coup.

03:05:11.940 --> 03:05:18.840
You know, after we stormed the Capitol building, they're going to coup, wait, our guy's the

03:05:18.840 --> 03:05:19.840
president now.

03:05:19.840 --> 03:05:21.180
Speaking of coup.

03:05:21.180 --> 03:05:24.040
So now is the coup, but...

03:05:24.040 --> 03:05:26.780
You know who's conspicuous in their absence?

03:05:26.780 --> 03:05:27.780
Steve Pechenik.

03:05:27.780 --> 03:05:32.540
No, he's, he's got to get those ballots.

03:05:32.540 --> 03:05:35.220
We've got to find those ballots, man.

03:05:35.220 --> 03:05:37.820
They've got the blockchain.

03:05:37.820 --> 03:05:45.140
I would say call number one for me if I'm Alex, Steve, get your ass on air.

03:05:45.140 --> 03:05:49.380
Trump has abandoned us, so it's time for Melania to take over.

03:05:49.380 --> 03:05:52.700
Also conspicuous in their absence, Roger Stone.

03:05:52.700 --> 03:05:56.060
Hey, Roger, do you want to come on?

03:05:56.060 --> 03:05:57.060
No.

03:05:57.060 --> 03:05:59.460
I don't.

03:05:59.460 --> 03:06:01.580
Please leave a message for Roger Stone.

03:06:01.580 --> 03:06:02.580
Yeah, exactly.

03:06:02.580 --> 03:06:03.580
That shit's going to voicemail.

03:06:03.580 --> 03:06:06.380
I am not dealing with Alex's bullshit today.

03:06:06.380 --> 03:06:07.380
Nope.

03:06:07.380 --> 03:06:08.380
Gotta eat a sandwich myself.

03:06:08.380 --> 03:06:12.020
I am drunk in the bunker.

03:06:12.020 --> 03:06:18.420
So we get now to Alex's firsthand guy who got the video.

03:06:18.420 --> 03:06:19.420
Sure.

03:06:19.420 --> 03:06:24.860
Now Alex is going to pretend that he hasn't already said that this person works for InfoWars.

03:06:24.860 --> 03:06:27.700
All right, Tyler Hansen is here with us.

03:06:27.700 --> 03:06:28.900
He was another witness.

03:06:28.900 --> 03:06:32.220
I've seen his footage, absolutely horrible, of this poor woman.

03:06:32.220 --> 03:06:37.660
We don't know her name yet, who was executed by some type of security force inside the

03:06:37.660 --> 03:06:41.160
North Korean death chamber that is the US Capitol.

03:06:41.160 --> 03:06:46.180
Alex conveniently fails to mention that Taylor Hansen, not Tyler, is the InfoWars cameraman

03:06:46.180 --> 03:06:48.500
that's been referenced multiple times already.

03:06:48.500 --> 03:06:53.480
Owen was hanging out with Taylor the night before, and by hanging out, this is actually

03:06:53.480 --> 03:06:54.480
what I mean.

03:06:54.480 --> 03:06:55.480
Here's how they took video.

03:06:55.480 --> 03:07:03.340
All right, so my good friend Taylor here is going to do a little Black Lives Matter enrichment

03:07:03.340 --> 03:07:04.340
ceremony.

03:07:04.340 --> 03:07:05.340
Taylor, Tyler, Taylor.

03:07:05.340 --> 03:07:06.340
So who wants to see this flag?

03:07:06.340 --> 03:07:07.340
To my audience, I'm just going to say, I'm not afraid of any kind of security.

03:07:07.340 --> 03:07:08.340
VLM sucks.

03:07:08.340 --> 03:07:09.340
VLM sucks.

03:07:09.340 --> 03:07:10.340
VLM sucks.

03:07:10.340 --> 03:07:11.340
VLM sucks.

03:07:11.340 --> 03:07:12.340
VLM sucks.

03:07:12.340 --> 03:07:13.340
VLM sucks.

03:07:13.340 --> 03:07:14.340
VLM sucks.

03:07:14.340 --> 03:07:15.340
VLM sucks.

03:07:15.340 --> 03:07:16.340
VLM sucks.

03:07:16.340 --> 03:07:17.340
VLM sucks.

03:07:17.340 --> 03:07:18.340
VLM sucks.

03:07:18.340 --> 03:07:19.340
VLM sucks.

03:07:19.340 --> 03:07:20.340
VLM sucks.

03:07:20.340 --> 03:07:21.340
VLM sucks.

03:07:21.340 --> 03:07:22.340
VLM sucks.

03:07:22.340 --> 03:07:25.740
VLM sucks.

03:07:25.740 --> 03:07:30.280
VLM sucks.

03:07:30.280 --> 03:07:34.000
VLM sucks.

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:36.960
VLM sucks.

03:07:36.960 --> 03:07:39.540
VLM sucks.

03:07:39.540 --> 03:07:42.020
What the fuck is going on here, dude?

03:07:42.020 --> 03:07:43.100
We're going to get all dirt on it.

03:07:43.100 --> 03:07:44.100
Yeah.

03:07:44.100 --> 03:07:45.100
Fuck Antifa.

03:07:45.100 --> 03:07:46.100
Fuck Antifa.

03:07:46.100 --> 03:07:47.100
Fuck Antifa.

03:07:47.100 --> 03:07:48.100
Fuck Antifa.

03:07:48.100 --> 03:07:49.100
Fuck Antifa.

03:07:49.100 --> 03:07:50.100
And Tifa can burn the American flag if she can't burn this propaganda bullshit?

03:07:50.100 --> 03:07:51.100
Yeah.

03:07:51.100 --> 03:07:52.100
Yeah.

03:07:52.100 --> 03:08:03.340
So yeah, the night before, Owen and Taylor had gotten together with a group of people

03:08:03.340 --> 03:08:10.460
and doused a Black Lives Matter flag in lighter fluid, set it on fire, and chanted, fuck BLM,

03:08:10.460 --> 03:08:11.460
BLM sucks.

03:08:11.460 --> 03:08:14.900
Didn't we hear earlier Alex say that BLM isn't our enemy in a TV business?

03:08:14.900 --> 03:08:15.900
No, Owen said that.

03:08:15.900 --> 03:08:16.900
Oh, Owen said that.

03:08:16.900 --> 03:08:17.900
Oh, that's odd.

03:08:17.900 --> 03:08:18.960
The night before it burned their flag.

03:08:18.960 --> 03:08:19.960
That's weird.

03:08:19.960 --> 03:08:20.960
Yeah.

03:08:20.960 --> 03:08:21.960
That's weird.

03:08:21.960 --> 03:08:27.780
It's also weird how they're pretending that this is just a guy who got footage.

03:08:27.780 --> 03:08:29.460
Just a patriot out there, Dan.

03:08:29.460 --> 03:08:31.700
Or maybe an Antifa provocateur?

03:08:31.700 --> 03:08:34.880
Hey everybody, Dan here.

03:08:34.880 --> 03:08:39.900
Just wanted to drop in to make a little bit of a correction here.

03:08:39.900 --> 03:08:49.340
There is something going on here, definitely, about this dude, Taylor, who Alex is interviewing.

03:08:49.340 --> 03:08:50.940
But I messed something up.

03:08:50.940 --> 03:08:54.980
I mixed something up and that is my fault and I'd just like to correct that.

03:08:54.980 --> 03:08:59.100
I didn't realize this until after we'd recorded the episode, but I didn't want to take it

03:08:59.100 --> 03:09:02.300
out but at the same time I didn't want anyone to get the wrong idea.

03:09:02.300 --> 03:09:10.620
There were actually two videos that are being referenced and it's very unclear and I made

03:09:10.620 --> 03:09:12.040
a hasty assumption.

03:09:12.040 --> 03:09:20.420
There was an Infowars camera person who was filming at the Capitol when people had stormed

03:09:20.420 --> 03:09:23.220
and the shooting did take place.

03:09:23.220 --> 03:09:30.580
And in addition to that, Taylor Hanson was also there and he had shot some video.

03:09:30.580 --> 03:09:37.260
So I apologize for the mistake, there's no indication necessarily that Taylor himself

03:09:37.260 --> 03:09:42.940
is an Infowars employee, although very much clearly an Infowars associate in as much as

03:09:42.940 --> 03:09:51.100
he's hanging out in Owen Troyer's hotel room and he is on video the night before, setting

03:09:51.100 --> 03:09:54.260
a Black Lives Matter flag on fire with Owen.

03:09:54.260 --> 03:09:59.100
So there's something going on that was really confusing about the social dynamics between

03:09:59.100 --> 03:10:06.940
pretending he was a stranger to them, when in fact he was very well known to them, and

03:10:06.940 --> 03:10:13.340
the multiple people recording stuff, it was very, it was a mess.

03:10:13.340 --> 03:10:18.060
Anyway, sorry I got that mixed up, now back to the episode.

03:10:18.060 --> 03:10:22.780
The next day after this, Taylor Hanson was a guest on Laura Ingraham's show.

03:10:22.780 --> 03:10:24.420
Taylor better be really careful.

03:10:24.420 --> 03:10:28.180
I certainly hope that the video showing him burning a Black Lives Matter flag the night

03:10:28.180 --> 03:10:32.180
before doesn't paint his journalistic intentions as being a little bit iffy.

03:10:32.180 --> 03:10:35.460
I would imagine that he and Alex should be really concerned right now about him getting

03:10:35.460 --> 03:10:40.340
arrested for illegal entry into the Capitol building because he was clearly not there

03:10:40.340 --> 03:10:41.860
as some kind of an objective journalist.

03:10:41.860 --> 03:10:44.300
No, no, no, he's pressed, Dan, he's pressed.

03:10:44.300 --> 03:10:48.060
He's an Infowars employee who was trying to get a sizzle reel.

03:10:48.060 --> 03:10:53.020
What, are you against the freedom of the press now, Dan?

03:10:53.020 --> 03:10:59.220
So they'll get to this interview in a little bit, but Alex wants to play the video first,

03:10:59.220 --> 03:11:00.220
right?

03:11:00.220 --> 03:11:04.380
And he's really excited to play this video, but not so excited that he doesn't get distracted.

03:11:04.380 --> 03:11:09.100
They're like, Trump caused violence, Trump's bad, remove him, blah, blah, they're not telling

03:11:09.100 --> 03:11:13.860
you they executed a woman, I got Joe Rogan calling me, let's just take this call.

03:11:13.860 --> 03:11:15.740
Hey Joe, how you doing?

03:11:15.740 --> 03:11:16.740
Alex.

03:11:16.740 --> 03:11:23.300
I am there, I'm in the middle of it.

03:11:23.300 --> 03:11:24.300
So that's jarring.

03:11:24.300 --> 03:11:25.300
Yeah.

03:11:25.300 --> 03:11:27.060
They play the video of her getting shot while Alex is.

03:11:27.060 --> 03:11:30.020
While Alex is on the phone, that's what the shot was?

03:11:30.020 --> 03:11:31.020
Yep.

03:11:31.020 --> 03:11:36.540
So you play that, cause Alex had already been setting up the clip, and now he's gotten a

03:11:36.540 --> 03:11:41.220
call from Rogan that he can't not answer, so he wants to interview Rogan, cause he has

03:11:41.220 --> 03:11:46.460
him on speakerphone, but apparently they go, like in the feed, they don't have Rogan's

03:11:46.460 --> 03:11:50.500
call on there, which I think is probably good, cause they don't have his permission.

03:11:50.500 --> 03:11:52.140
Cause they didn't ask her permission yet.

03:11:52.140 --> 03:11:53.140
Yeah.

03:11:53.140 --> 03:11:54.140
Yeah.

03:11:54.140 --> 03:11:55.140
And so Alex gets a little frustrated.

03:11:55.140 --> 03:11:56.140
Call him back.

03:11:56.140 --> 03:12:03.100
It's weird, I have such a great crew, but these remotes are very interesting.

03:12:03.100 --> 03:12:09.260
They're very interesting, cause they're just seizing up constantly, just seizing, seizing,

03:12:09.260 --> 03:12:10.260
seizing.

03:12:10.260 --> 03:12:11.260
Try again.

03:12:11.260 --> 03:12:12.260
We're live.

03:12:12.260 --> 03:12:13.260
That's great.

03:12:13.260 --> 03:12:14.260
This is all real.

03:12:14.260 --> 03:12:18.860
I'm here while they're killing people down there, so everything's good.

03:12:18.860 --> 03:12:23.020
Roll the footage without me talking over it, two and a half minutes, I have a timer.

03:12:23.020 --> 03:12:25.140
It's already played.

03:12:25.140 --> 03:12:31.260
I do think that he seems more interested in getting Rogan on than he is in this footage.

03:12:31.260 --> 03:12:32.260
Yeah.

03:12:32.260 --> 03:12:33.260
It's disrespectful.

03:12:33.260 --> 03:12:34.260
No, no, no, no, no.

03:12:34.260 --> 03:12:39.020
The martyr, the Maga martyr, uh, she's gonna galvanize it.

03:12:39.020 --> 03:12:40.020
Hold on.

03:12:40.020 --> 03:12:41.020
I got to take this call.

03:12:41.020 --> 03:12:42.020
It's Joe.

03:12:42.020 --> 03:12:43.020
It's a famous person.

03:12:43.020 --> 03:12:46.780
Now this Maga martyr, she's going to inspire the rebel, but I got to take a Joe Rogan call

03:12:46.780 --> 03:12:47.780
real quick.

03:12:47.780 --> 03:12:50.940
Joe Rogan, I don't know if you know this, uh, is a comedian.

03:12:50.940 --> 03:12:56.900
So the Maga martyr, uh, fighting the little Christian devil, uh, hero, but I got to talk

03:12:56.900 --> 03:13:00.460
to Joe Rogan, professional comedian.

03:13:00.460 --> 03:13:05.100
So now that that is out of the way and he can't get Rogan back on the phone, Alex decides,

03:13:05.100 --> 03:13:09.220
fuck it, I'll interview Taylor, uh, and pretend that I don't know him.

03:13:09.220 --> 03:13:10.220
Wild.

03:13:10.220 --> 03:13:11.220
Sir, thanks for being here with us.

03:13:11.220 --> 03:13:12.220
Tell us who you are.

03:13:12.220 --> 03:13:13.340
Tell us what you witnessed.

03:13:13.340 --> 03:13:14.660
My name is Taylor Hansen.

03:13:14.660 --> 03:13:20.620
I'm an independent journalist and she was the first one that actually had, uh, had headed

03:13:20.620 --> 03:13:21.620
into that hall.

03:13:21.620 --> 03:13:22.860
I was right behind her.

03:13:22.860 --> 03:13:24.240
This is nonsense.

03:13:24.240 --> 03:13:26.540
Why are they pretending that they don't know each other?

03:13:26.540 --> 03:13:28.380
Like literally listen to this, listen to this.

03:13:28.380 --> 03:13:30.460
This is just a little bit later.

03:13:30.460 --> 03:13:32.180
I was sitting with Taylor last night in my room.

03:13:32.180 --> 03:13:33.540
We were watching them steal the Jordan.

03:13:33.540 --> 03:13:35.340
I mean, you, I mean, I said it's over.

03:13:35.340 --> 03:13:38.140
Even when the Republicans were at, we were both like, we literally watched them do a

03:13:38.140 --> 03:13:39.140
switch.

03:13:39.140 --> 03:13:42.380
When we first sit down and watched it, Owen and Taylor were clearly friends.

03:13:42.380 --> 03:13:45.600
They were hanging out in their hotel room last night.

03:13:45.600 --> 03:13:47.220
It's so bizarre.

03:13:47.220 --> 03:13:53.140
So Owen's got an interesting theory at this point about the stealing of the election.

03:13:53.140 --> 03:13:54.140
Sure.

03:13:54.140 --> 03:13:56.340
Oh, by the way, we're not going to listen to much of Taylor cause he's really boring

03:13:56.340 --> 03:13:58.340
outside of the fact that it's clearly a charade.

03:13:58.340 --> 03:14:00.940
It's clearly a ridiculous dance.

03:14:00.940 --> 03:14:01.940
Yeah.

03:14:01.940 --> 03:14:03.300
This is an interesting theory.

03:14:03.300 --> 03:14:10.520
I think that Owen suspects that the communist Chinese are going through an elaborate conspiracy

03:14:10.520 --> 03:14:13.060
just to make him mad.

03:14:13.060 --> 03:14:15.260
The election is completely fake.

03:14:15.260 --> 03:14:16.780
It's not that they steal elections.

03:14:16.780 --> 03:14:18.100
Of course they steal elections.

03:14:18.100 --> 03:14:23.260
They rigged this election last night to make it look like they stole it intentionally and

03:14:23.260 --> 03:14:27.620
to make it look like it's close intentionally, all being done by the Chinese who run the

03:14:27.620 --> 03:14:33.260
voting machines so that they could get this anger, get this ill sentiment, get these fake

03:14:33.260 --> 03:14:39.260
people in, and then have us mad that they just stole our presidency and stole our Senate.

03:14:39.260 --> 03:14:40.500
Yeah, man.

03:14:40.500 --> 03:14:42.980
That's pretty, that's pretty ambitious as a conspiracy theory.

03:14:42.980 --> 03:14:50.140
So if I understand correctly, the globalists both made the election look like they stole

03:14:50.140 --> 03:14:51.140
it.

03:14:51.140 --> 03:14:52.140
Yes.

03:14:52.140 --> 03:14:57.580
While at the same time actually making the election look as though we're close while

03:14:57.580 --> 03:15:00.540
at the same time actually stealing it.

03:15:00.540 --> 03:15:01.540
Yes.

03:15:01.540 --> 03:15:04.460
And they wanted to make it close because they knew if it wasn't close, it wouldn't anger

03:15:04.460 --> 03:15:06.460
people like Owen.

03:15:06.460 --> 03:15:09.820
And it had to be obvious that it was stolen cause that would also piss them off quite

03:15:09.820 --> 03:15:10.820
a bit.

03:15:10.820 --> 03:15:13.900
Cause it was a come from behind victory cause it was one of those gut punch losses, you

03:15:13.900 --> 03:15:14.900
know?

03:15:14.900 --> 03:15:21.620
It's like when LeBron sunk that three to knock out my beloved Bulls.

03:15:21.620 --> 03:15:26.260
They're imagining that like she is just sitting around and being like, Owen's going to hate

03:15:26.260 --> 03:15:27.260
this.

03:15:27.260 --> 03:15:28.260
Owen's going to be so pissed.

03:15:28.260 --> 03:15:31.160
Oh, he's not going to like this one.

03:15:31.160 --> 03:15:35.180
So they'd, they covered Trump's video that he put out.

03:15:35.180 --> 03:15:40.620
I'm guessing you saw that where he called everyone special and I love you all go home.

03:15:40.620 --> 03:15:41.620
Yeah.

03:15:41.620 --> 03:15:42.620
Yeah.

03:15:42.620 --> 03:15:43.620
That was great.

03:15:43.620 --> 03:15:44.620
That was a really good way to de-escalate.

03:15:44.620 --> 03:15:45.620
Fucked up.

03:15:45.620 --> 03:15:46.620
Hey, listen, they stole it.

03:15:46.620 --> 03:15:49.660
Everything you're doing is right and I love you, but it's time to go home.

03:15:49.660 --> 03:15:50.660
Yeah.

03:15:50.660 --> 03:15:51.660
It's 6 PM guys.

03:15:51.660 --> 03:15:52.860
Fucked up.

03:15:52.860 --> 03:15:55.740
So they do cover that, but it's basically exactly what you would expect.

03:15:55.740 --> 03:15:56.740
Yeah.

03:15:56.740 --> 03:16:00.600
The only thing that I find shocking is after Trump had put out that video, he more or less

03:16:00.600 --> 03:16:02.900
tweeted something pretty similar.

03:16:02.900 --> 03:16:03.900
Yeah.

03:16:03.900 --> 03:16:07.060
And even Tom Papert is shocked by this tweet.

03:16:07.060 --> 03:16:08.060
Listen to this.

03:16:08.060 --> 03:16:10.220
Tom is like, what?

03:16:10.220 --> 03:16:14.380
We just have a, a breaking a tweet from the president.

03:16:14.380 --> 03:16:18.900
President Trump tweets, which is one of his first tweets of the day.

03:16:18.900 --> 03:16:19.900
Really?

03:16:19.900 --> 03:16:21.900
These are, wow.

03:16:21.900 --> 03:16:23.380
President Donald Trump breaking.

03:16:23.380 --> 03:16:28.340
These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is

03:16:28.340 --> 03:16:34.620
so unceremoniously and viciously stripped away from great Patriots who have been badly

03:16:34.620 --> 03:16:37.820
and unfairly treated for so long.

03:16:37.820 --> 03:16:40.180
Tom Papert's a shithead and he believes all that stuff.

03:16:40.180 --> 03:16:43.000
And even he was like, holy shit, Trump said that.

03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:45.860
So then how is it Antifa agents?

03:16:45.860 --> 03:16:46.860
I guess it can't be.

03:16:46.860 --> 03:16:47.860
I don't know.

03:16:47.860 --> 03:16:50.260
These people are, it's all just like, whatever.

03:16:50.260 --> 03:16:51.260
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

03:16:51.260 --> 03:16:52.260
Let's do all of it.

03:16:52.260 --> 03:16:53.260
Yeah.

03:16:53.260 --> 03:16:54.260
100%.

03:16:54.260 --> 03:16:56.900
Throw it all out there tonight and then we'll pick something to stick with tomorrow.

03:16:56.900 --> 03:16:57.900
Yeah.

03:16:57.900 --> 03:16:58.900
And at this point.

03:16:58.900 --> 03:16:59.900
That's shameful.

03:16:59.900 --> 03:17:00.900
That should not be.

03:17:00.900 --> 03:17:05.300
That's I know it's, look, we're on sin 10,000, but I mean, really.

03:17:05.300 --> 03:17:06.300
It's our fourth anniversary.

03:17:06.300 --> 03:17:07.300
Yeah.

03:17:07.300 --> 03:17:08.300
That's fucked up.

03:17:08.300 --> 03:17:09.300
Yeah.

03:17:09.300 --> 03:17:10.300
That's crazy.

03:17:10.300 --> 03:17:11.300
Yeah.

03:17:11.300 --> 03:17:18.940
So, um, Alex is really trying to push home this idea that the woman who got shot is going

03:17:18.940 --> 03:17:20.700
to be covered up by the media.

03:17:20.700 --> 03:17:22.080
The media is not going to talk about it.

03:17:22.080 --> 03:17:27.100
Just going to pretend that didn't happen because it's too threatening to the globalists because

03:17:27.100 --> 03:17:30.620
she's a martyr for the cause of the Patriots and the revolutionaries.

03:17:30.620 --> 03:17:31.620
I'm sorry.

03:17:31.620 --> 03:17:33.140
I would love to hear more about her, but I got to take this call.

03:17:33.140 --> 03:17:34.460
Joe, Joe Rogan is calling me.

03:17:34.460 --> 03:17:37.860
No, I know I care about the martyr, but I got to take this call.

03:17:37.860 --> 03:17:38.860
So Trump's the real deal.

03:17:38.860 --> 03:17:39.860
One in a landslide.

03:17:39.860 --> 03:17:40.860
One in a landslide.

03:17:40.860 --> 03:17:42.620
We got to find this woman's name.

03:17:42.620 --> 03:17:46.860
Does anybody know name of the woman killed in DC?

03:17:46.860 --> 03:17:49.180
Name of the woman killed in DC.

03:17:49.180 --> 03:17:51.500
Name of the woman killed in DC.

03:17:51.500 --> 03:17:52.900
Name of the woman killed in DC.

03:17:52.900 --> 03:17:53.900
Say her name.

03:17:53.900 --> 03:17:54.900
Say her name.

03:17:54.900 --> 03:17:55.900
Say her name.

03:17:55.900 --> 03:17:57.900
Cause we, cause they're not going to want us to know.

03:17:57.900 --> 03:17:58.900
No.

03:17:58.900 --> 03:17:59.900
They're gonna try to suppress us for a while.

03:17:59.900 --> 03:18:04.180
By this point, uh, people were already figured out who she was on Twitter and everything's

03:18:04.180 --> 03:18:05.180
fine.

03:18:05.180 --> 03:18:06.180
We know where she lives.

03:18:06.180 --> 03:18:07.180
Yeah.

03:18:07.180 --> 03:18:08.420
Uh, that other voice is Ali Alexander.

03:18:08.420 --> 03:18:10.180
She is also hanging out on the roof of this hotel.

03:18:10.180 --> 03:18:11.180
Of course.

03:18:11.180 --> 03:18:14.500
They're all just getting drunk after a fucking boat parade.

03:18:14.500 --> 03:18:15.500
It does seem that way.

03:18:15.500 --> 03:18:16.500
That is what's happening.

03:18:16.500 --> 03:18:17.500
Yes.

03:18:17.500 --> 03:18:18.500
These people are fucking stupid.

03:18:18.500 --> 03:18:19.500
It does seem that way.

03:18:19.500 --> 03:18:23.020
So Alex tries to sign off here cause he's, uh, he's done it.

03:18:23.020 --> 03:18:24.020
He's tired.

03:18:24.020 --> 03:18:25.020
It's been a long day.

03:18:25.020 --> 03:18:26.820
He took a little walk leading that parade earlier.

03:18:26.820 --> 03:18:29.940
I know it's hard to remember that happened on this episode.

03:18:29.940 --> 03:18:36.580
Um, but uh, yeah, so he's signing off and uh, they seem like they really care about

03:18:36.580 --> 03:18:38.540
this woman who got shot.

03:18:38.540 --> 03:18:41.220
They're demonizing Trump with this narrative.

03:18:41.220 --> 03:18:42.900
They're demonizing that he caused the violence.

03:18:42.900 --> 03:18:44.740
No, protesting is good.

03:18:44.740 --> 03:18:45.740
We were peaceful.

03:18:45.740 --> 03:18:48.940
The federal police attacked the protesters first, eliciting a response.

03:18:48.940 --> 03:18:51.900
Now they killed a woman in cold blood and they hope nobody gets that out, but you're

03:18:51.900 --> 03:18:55.260
going to get that out.

03:18:55.260 --> 03:18:57.220
Truly sad what's going on here.

03:18:57.220 --> 03:19:02.740
Well, they, they just full of empathy and care for their common person, their fellow

03:19:02.740 --> 03:19:04.260
human.

03:19:04.260 --> 03:19:08.220
So Alex is signing off, but he throws it to Owen to wrap it up.

03:19:08.220 --> 03:19:09.220
Oh, of course.

03:19:09.220 --> 03:19:11.780
Cause they still got a little time on the war room or something.

03:19:11.780 --> 03:19:12.780
I don't know.

03:19:12.780 --> 03:19:13.780
That's necessary.

03:19:13.780 --> 03:19:16.020
People are definitely going to want to make sure they get the last 10 minutes of this

03:19:16.020 --> 03:19:17.020
shit.

03:19:17.020 --> 03:19:18.020
Yeah.

03:19:18.020 --> 03:19:19.020
Yeah.

03:19:19.020 --> 03:19:20.020
So Alex is gone.

03:19:20.020 --> 03:19:21.020
Yeah.

03:19:21.020 --> 03:19:22.020
Theoretically.

03:19:22.020 --> 03:19:25.900
Owen tries to get reflective about like, what do we call this?

03:19:25.900 --> 03:19:28.220
What do we call what's happened?

03:19:28.220 --> 03:19:32.080
I'm wondering what to call this situation.

03:19:32.080 --> 03:19:38.660
So we pushing and pushing and pushing and no one ever pushes back and they freak out

03:19:38.660 --> 03:19:39.660
when we push back.

03:19:39.660 --> 03:19:40.760
They burn the country down.

03:19:40.760 --> 03:19:43.980
We push back, they kill a woman and we're the bad guys.

03:19:43.980 --> 03:19:45.620
Don't you take our kindness for weakness.

03:19:45.620 --> 03:19:46.620
You are the bad guy.

03:19:46.620 --> 03:19:47.620
Go ahead.

03:19:47.620 --> 03:19:48.620
I'm sorry.

03:19:48.620 --> 03:19:49.620
So wait, was it Antifa or not?

03:19:49.620 --> 03:19:54.200
Wait, did you just barged back in to yell that the globalists don't like it when you

03:19:54.200 --> 03:19:55.900
push back and what?

03:19:55.900 --> 03:19:56.940
That's the problem.

03:19:56.940 --> 03:20:01.900
They want a violent revolution, but it looks stupid and they can't make money off of it.

03:20:01.900 --> 03:20:02.900
Yeah.

03:20:02.900 --> 03:20:03.900
So now we're trapped.

03:20:03.900 --> 03:20:04.900
Yeah.

03:20:04.900 --> 03:20:05.900
They want it both ways.

03:20:05.900 --> 03:20:06.900
Yeah.

03:20:06.900 --> 03:20:07.900
And it's no good.

03:20:07.900 --> 03:20:10.420
And they also want their violent revolution to be non-violent for them.

03:20:10.420 --> 03:20:13.500
They want to play a video game in god mode.

03:20:13.500 --> 03:20:16.060
They don't want to actually, oh, it's just like fucking democracy.

03:20:16.060 --> 03:20:19.660
Oh, we live in a republic, but I don't want to risk losing an election.

03:20:19.660 --> 03:20:20.660
Sure.

03:20:20.660 --> 03:20:21.660
You know?

03:20:21.660 --> 03:20:22.660
The tyranny of the majority.

03:20:22.660 --> 03:20:23.660
Oh, I can't stand that.

03:20:23.660 --> 03:20:24.660
But I mean, yeah.

03:20:24.660 --> 03:20:28.840
So Owen wants to wrap up now because he was only supposed to say a few more things and

03:20:28.840 --> 03:20:30.420
Alex won't let him.

03:20:30.420 --> 03:20:34.780
A million or at least, I mean half a million minimum at the Trump rally by 9 a.m. today,

03:20:34.780 --> 03:20:38.440
they sat there and stood there, cheered all day long for all the great speakers and then

03:20:38.440 --> 03:20:43.480
president Trump, president Trump was on the phone with Mike Pence before he spoke.

03:20:43.480 --> 03:20:48.180
My guess is I don't, I mean, demanding, begging.

03:20:48.180 --> 03:20:51.940
I've got some more witnesses to her getting executed and now that's what people got mad

03:20:51.940 --> 03:20:52.940
and fought back.

03:20:52.940 --> 03:20:53.940
So bring these guys in.

03:20:53.940 --> 03:20:54.940
Bring this other chair in.

03:20:54.940 --> 03:20:56.940
Hey guys, we're shutting down soon.

03:20:56.940 --> 03:21:01.580
Come up here, you came here, pull your chair in right there, get up there with Owen.

03:21:01.580 --> 03:21:02.580
Introduce yourself.

03:21:02.580 --> 03:21:03.580
Go ahead, gentlemen.

03:21:03.580 --> 03:21:04.580
So you got some more witnesses.

03:21:04.580 --> 03:21:05.580
Oh boy.

03:21:05.580 --> 03:21:07.220
So Owen tries to interview these people.

03:21:07.220 --> 03:21:08.740
Also, Infowars employees.

03:21:08.740 --> 03:21:10.420
It turns out they're not so much witnesses.

03:21:10.420 --> 03:21:13.740
All right, so you guys were, you guys were in the Capitol today.

03:21:13.740 --> 03:21:17.260
Um, are you guys both eyewitnesses to the lady's execution?

03:21:17.260 --> 03:21:20.140
Uh, the immediate aftermath.

03:21:20.140 --> 03:21:21.140
Yeah.

03:21:21.140 --> 03:21:22.140
Okay.

03:21:22.140 --> 03:21:24.140
So why don't you talk about what you saw?

03:21:24.140 --> 03:21:28.340
Um, I don't, I mean, it was pandemonium there.

03:21:28.340 --> 03:21:30.060
Yeah, you'd assume so.

03:21:30.060 --> 03:21:31.060
Wild.

03:21:31.060 --> 03:21:32.060
Yeah.

03:21:32.060 --> 03:21:33.860
So you didn't actually see the thing that we're presenting you as a witness of.

03:21:33.860 --> 03:21:36.220
Well, I didn't see the per se.

03:21:36.220 --> 03:21:40.700
Also, unfortunate, you guys have put yourself in a place you're not legally supposed to

03:21:40.700 --> 03:21:41.900
have been.

03:21:41.900 --> 03:21:46.540
And these witnesses are not witnesses, they're right-wing blog types.

03:21:46.540 --> 03:21:50.740
One of them is Lucian Wintrick, who's the former White House correspondent working at

03:21:50.740 --> 03:21:55.100
the Gateway Pundit, and somebody who's been on Infowars a bunch in the past.

03:21:55.100 --> 03:21:58.460
There's no way that Alex and Owen don't know who he is, yet they're pretending that they

03:21:58.460 --> 03:22:02.140
don't know each other, and it's just a random person who witnessed the shooting.

03:22:02.140 --> 03:22:04.780
It's so bizarre that no one knows each other.

03:22:04.780 --> 03:22:09.380
Also, the other guy, his name is Matthew Foster, I have no idea who he is, but he's probably

03:22:09.380 --> 03:22:11.180
a shithead because he's hanging out with Lucian.

03:22:11.180 --> 03:22:12.780
Yeah, that would make sense.

03:22:12.780 --> 03:22:17.620
But like, both of them are now like, we were in there when that shooting happened, well,

03:22:17.620 --> 03:22:18.620
guess what?

03:22:18.620 --> 03:22:19.620
You committed a crime.

03:22:19.620 --> 03:22:20.620
Hey, there you go.

03:22:20.620 --> 03:22:25.340
So, a lot of people making these investigations pretty easy.

03:22:25.340 --> 03:22:32.580
They really don't understand that they're wrong, and that crime is real, even if they

03:22:32.580 --> 03:22:33.580
do it.

03:22:33.580 --> 03:22:34.580
Yeah, yeah.

03:22:34.580 --> 03:22:38.780
And I don't think white people can revolt in the United States, they're too goddamn

03:22:38.780 --> 03:22:39.780
entitled.

03:22:39.780 --> 03:22:45.900
And part of, you know, sort of non-violent civil disobedience is the recognition that

03:22:45.900 --> 03:22:50.500
there will be consequences, and you will have to bear those consequences, and that's part

03:22:50.500 --> 03:22:51.500
of it.

03:22:51.500 --> 03:22:55.860
So like, if you're doing something where you invade the Senate chamber and you do a sit-in

03:22:55.860 --> 03:23:00.500
or something like that, you recognize that there are consequences legally for that because

03:23:00.500 --> 03:23:03.300
what you're doing is technically illegal.

03:23:03.300 --> 03:23:10.660
And so these guys have decided to engage in some form of the protest that they feel is

03:23:10.660 --> 03:23:11.660
appropriate.

03:23:11.660 --> 03:23:14.340
They have committed crimes, and now they will have to bear it.

03:23:14.340 --> 03:23:17.540
No, but they're not supposed to be illegal, and I'm not supposed to be punished for it,

03:23:17.540 --> 03:23:18.540
Dan.

03:23:18.540 --> 03:23:22.620
I have no feelings, Lucian, but unfortunately- No, but I'm the good guy.

03:23:22.620 --> 03:23:24.100
There should be a warrant out for your arrest.

03:23:24.100 --> 03:23:28.220
No, look, I'm the good guy, see, because they stole the election, I'm good.

03:23:28.220 --> 03:23:32.640
Anyway, their interview is very boring, and we have one last clip where Alex encourages

03:23:32.640 --> 03:23:36.300
Trump to use this woman's death as a weapon.

03:23:36.300 --> 03:23:37.300
Sure.

03:23:37.300 --> 03:23:40.460
I'm gonna call General Flynn, I'm gonna call Giuliani, I'm gonna call all my contacts and

03:23:40.460 --> 03:23:42.340
Trump's lawyers.

03:23:42.340 --> 03:23:45.900
Trump has to say, we had a great event with over a million people, it was all peaceful.

03:23:45.900 --> 03:23:47.780
Riot police attacked folks, they pushed back a little.

03:23:47.780 --> 03:23:51.020
If you want to arrest those people, that's fine, but you don't shoot him in the neck,

03:23:51.020 --> 03:23:54.460
and he needs to know the name of that woman, and humanize her, and turn that against him,

03:23:54.460 --> 03:23:57.340
because they're blaming Trump for everything right now, and 25th Amendment.

03:23:57.340 --> 03:23:58.620
The fight is now.

03:23:58.620 --> 03:24:01.500
So we're gonna end this transformation in five minutes with your final comments, Tom

03:24:01.500 --> 03:24:04.980
Pappert's gonna take over, and then I'm gonna go to work tonight calling influencers and

03:24:04.980 --> 03:24:08.460
tell the president, don't cuck on this, go on the offense.

03:24:08.460 --> 03:24:10.100
Don't cuck on it.

03:24:10.100 --> 03:24:15.060
Later in the evening, Alex did a report about how Pence is gonna invoke the 25th Amendment,

03:24:15.060 --> 03:24:21.060
basically just taking Pappert's imagination and reporting it as news, and by that point

03:24:21.060 --> 03:24:24.900
he still is unaware of what this lady's name is, and I know what her name is, but I just

03:24:24.900 --> 03:24:28.220
don't care, I don't want to get involved.

03:24:28.220 --> 03:24:36.960
If there is one skill that Donald Trump absolutely does not possess, it is getting people to

03:24:36.960 --> 03:24:39.480
care about human life.

03:24:39.480 --> 03:24:40.480
That is true.

03:24:40.480 --> 03:24:46.820
So, if you are asking Donald Trump to shit all over her for being dead, and failing in

03:24:46.820 --> 03:24:52.780
her mission, if you wanted the president to go on TV and say, he loves insurrectionists

03:24:52.780 --> 03:24:56.340
who don't get shot by the cops, you can get that.

03:24:56.340 --> 03:24:57.940
Yeah, he's skilled at that.

03:24:57.940 --> 03:25:02.260
I don't think you're gonna get anybody being a martyr, but Trump.

03:25:02.260 --> 03:25:08.220
Yeah, and if it's not personally involved him, I don't think he would care.

03:25:08.220 --> 03:25:09.220
He doesn't give a shit.

03:25:09.220 --> 03:25:16.460
So, I watched all this, and I lived inside this a bit, and it was really weird, because

03:25:16.460 --> 03:25:21.180
I was experiencing a lot of stuff that was like what everyone else was experiencing,

03:25:21.180 --> 03:25:29.260
and reality-based, and at the same time I was seeing and paying attention to the reportage

03:25:29.260 --> 03:25:34.980
and what have you on Infowars, and the gap between the two is staggering.

03:25:34.980 --> 03:25:44.500
And it really, I mean, lack of talent aside, because he had people like Papert and Harrison,

03:25:44.500 --> 03:25:53.140
who just aren't good at this, that aside, there was a noticeable rockiness to trying

03:25:53.140 --> 03:25:59.080
to figure out what to do, how to cover this, and then there was a singularity of purpose

03:25:59.080 --> 03:26:04.900
that Alex had that I really felt, as I was listening to this, it fit that idea that he

03:26:04.900 --> 03:26:07.380
is trying to create patriot lore.

03:26:07.380 --> 03:26:14.100
He's trying to create a myth out of this, that is, this woman was murdered for the cause,

03:26:14.100 --> 03:26:20.060
and the globalists shot her to make us look bad, Antifa probably agitated.

03:26:20.060 --> 03:26:22.640
But also we were right to do the, yeah.

03:26:22.640 --> 03:26:27.500
In case it wasn't Antifa, we were right to do it.

03:26:27.500 --> 03:26:37.300
I felt the first pages of narratives and first pages of things that will affect people down

03:26:37.300 --> 03:26:43.380
the road, be rallying cries for people in fucked up ways, and I hope that that's not

03:26:43.380 --> 03:26:47.900
the case, but that is the general sense of what I felt Alex's intentions were.

03:26:47.900 --> 03:26:52.560
Now, at the same time, everybody else around him is working across purposes.

03:26:52.560 --> 03:26:55.220
Everyone else, I have no idea what the fuck they're doing.

03:26:55.220 --> 03:26:56.980
Tom Papert seems insane.

03:26:56.980 --> 03:26:57.980
He's nuts.

03:26:57.980 --> 03:27:01.420
Harrison Smith seems like a true believer, Owen Troyer.

03:27:01.420 --> 03:27:06.820
Splits the difference somewhere between just being angry and also wanting to make daddy

03:27:06.820 --> 03:27:07.820
so happy.

03:27:07.820 --> 03:27:08.820
Yeah.

03:27:08.820 --> 03:27:12.100
So he's like, I want to kill everybody, but also daddy needs money, so I'm going to back

03:27:12.100 --> 03:27:14.800
off because he said so, but I do want to kill everybody.

03:27:14.800 --> 03:27:18.020
And also I've recently realized that I'm pretty good at standup comedy.

03:27:18.020 --> 03:27:19.020
I'm pretty great.

03:27:19.020 --> 03:27:20.860
I got one bit, give me 15.

03:27:20.860 --> 03:27:21.860
Yeah.

03:27:21.860 --> 03:27:26.340
Hey, look, I'm unemployable if Info Wars goes away, self-employed is a comic, baby.

03:27:26.340 --> 03:27:27.340
That's where the money is.

03:27:27.340 --> 03:27:29.620
I know this guy named Joe.

03:27:29.620 --> 03:27:31.780
He made millions doing standup.

03:27:31.780 --> 03:27:35.900
I'm going to go on tour with Nick DiPaolo.

03:27:35.900 --> 03:27:36.900
Everything's going to be all right.

03:27:36.900 --> 03:27:39.780
I'm going to middle for Rob Schneider.

03:27:39.780 --> 03:27:49.620
So I think that we've taken a bit of a, I don't know, maybe a lighter tone than maybe

03:27:49.620 --> 03:27:53.300
some people would feel and maybe lighter than I feel at times.

03:27:53.300 --> 03:27:54.300
Sure, sure.

03:27:54.300 --> 03:28:00.340
And I think a part of that is just, we're looking at Alex and this is scary, but he's

03:28:00.340 --> 03:28:01.540
also a fucking idiot.

03:28:01.540 --> 03:28:02.540
Right.

03:28:02.540 --> 03:28:03.540
And this is idiotic.

03:28:03.540 --> 03:28:04.540
Right.

03:28:04.540 --> 03:28:14.640
And I'm, yeah, I mean, I'm in a place, I feel like I am coming at this from a completely

03:28:14.640 --> 03:28:17.880
different point of view than everyone.

03:28:17.880 --> 03:28:18.880
And it freaks me out.

03:28:18.880 --> 03:28:23.360
I feel a little insane because I have never felt more confident that we are not going

03:28:23.360 --> 03:28:30.460
to be overthrown because the reality of actually overthrowing the United States is that you

03:28:30.460 --> 03:28:33.340
would have to have the military on your side.

03:28:33.340 --> 03:28:38.760
And the most important thing about the military is that it is an arm of the economy.

03:28:38.760 --> 03:28:44.520
And there's no way that the economy is going to be collapsed by those fucking morons.

03:28:44.520 --> 03:28:49.540
And there's no way that the military leadership who could, I mean, it's entirely conceivable

03:28:49.540 --> 03:28:55.640
that that could have, that a coup could have happened if it was planned appropriately,

03:28:55.640 --> 03:29:01.400
if the military saw signals that this is actually some real shit, if Trump didn't fucking run

03:29:01.400 --> 03:29:02.520
away like a coward.

03:29:02.520 --> 03:29:03.520
Right.

03:29:03.520 --> 03:29:07.360
And if the right wing politicians, if the right wing politicians who are all up in arms

03:29:07.360 --> 03:29:14.040
about doing anything like that, if they joined the rally, I, all bets could be off.

03:29:14.040 --> 03:29:20.320
But everybody who's important in terms of running the world saw those people do that

03:29:20.320 --> 03:29:24.340
shit and went, oh fuck, they did it too soon.

03:29:24.340 --> 03:29:27.480
They blew their wad too early and now they're an embarrassment.

03:29:27.480 --> 03:29:28.480
Yeah.

03:29:28.480 --> 03:29:33.600
I see where you're coming from and I think that I can agree on the, on the sort of short

03:29:33.600 --> 03:29:34.600
scale.

03:29:34.600 --> 03:29:35.600
Sure.

03:29:35.600 --> 03:29:36.600
Sure.

03:29:36.600 --> 03:29:37.600
The fear, the fear is the longer scale.

03:29:37.600 --> 03:29:43.000
The lessons that can be learned by the very serious people who are among these groups

03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:50.300
of ding dongs, the lessons that you can take from this, the image of, you know, these people

03:29:50.300 --> 03:29:56.000
flying Confederate flags, invading the fucking capital.

03:29:56.000 --> 03:29:58.420
It's meaningful from an optics standpoint.

03:29:58.420 --> 03:29:59.540
It's emboldening.

03:29:59.540 --> 03:30:06.500
And so even if it doesn't encourage an actual like coup, those are the sorts of imagery

03:30:06.500 --> 03:30:11.560
and the sort of things that you would need in order to inspire people to take other kinds

03:30:11.560 --> 03:30:13.520
of actions that could be destructive.

03:30:13.520 --> 03:30:14.520
Right.

03:30:14.520 --> 03:30:15.520
Yeah.

03:30:15.520 --> 03:30:16.520
I don't know.

03:30:16.520 --> 03:30:17.520
I don't know.

03:30:17.520 --> 03:30:18.520
Yeah.

03:30:18.520 --> 03:30:19.520
Let's, let's, let's not go crazy.

03:30:19.520 --> 03:30:20.520
Yeah.

03:30:20.520 --> 03:30:21.520
Yeah.

03:30:21.520 --> 03:30:24.400
But I hope everyone is doing all right out there.

03:30:24.400 --> 03:30:28.960
We will find out what happened after this on Monday.

03:30:28.960 --> 03:30:31.440
We'll figure out whatever Alex decided.

03:30:31.440 --> 03:30:32.440
Maybe it was Antifa.

03:30:32.440 --> 03:30:33.440
Maybe it's not.

03:30:33.440 --> 03:30:34.440
Who knows?

03:30:34.440 --> 03:30:40.480
We'll see if by the next day Alex had figured out who this woman was.

03:30:40.480 --> 03:30:41.760
And yeah.

03:30:41.760 --> 03:30:43.200
But then, but until then we have a website.

03:30:43.200 --> 03:30:44.200
We do have a website.

03:30:44.200 --> 03:30:45.200
It's knowledgefight.com.

03:30:45.200 --> 03:30:46.200
Yeah.

03:30:46.200 --> 03:30:47.200
We're also on Twitter.

03:30:47.200 --> 03:30:48.200
We are on Twitter.

03:30:48.200 --> 03:30:49.200
It's at knowledgefight.net.

03:30:49.200 --> 03:30:50.200
Go to bed Jordan.

03:30:50.200 --> 03:30:51.200
We're also on Facebook.

03:30:51.200 --> 03:30:52.200
We are on Facebook.

03:30:52.200 --> 03:30:55.280
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

03:30:55.280 --> 03:30:56.480
doing God's work right now.

03:30:56.480 --> 03:30:57.480
Yeah.

03:30:57.480 --> 03:30:58.480
We'll be back.

03:30:58.480 --> 03:31:01.800
But until then, I'm Leo.

03:31:01.800 --> 03:31:02.800
I'm Leo.

03:31:02.800 --> 03:31:03.800
I'm DZX Clark.

03:31:03.800 --> 03:31:04.800
I'm Daryl Rundis.

03:31:04.800 --> 03:31:06.960
I'm the juiciest ice cube.

03:31:06.960 --> 03:31:07.960
Andy in Kansas.

03:31:07.960 --> 03:31:08.960
You're on the air.

03:31:08.960 --> 03:31:11.520
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller.

03:31:11.520 --> 03:31:12.520
I'm a huge fan.

03:31:12.520 --> 03:31:13.520
I love your work.

03:31:13.520 --> 03:31:14.520
I love you.

03:31:14.520 --> 03:31:43.520
Thank you so much for being with us today, and I'll see you in the next one.
