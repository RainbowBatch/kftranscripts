1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,960
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying, we are the bad guys, knowledge

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:33,960
fight.

3
00:00:33,960 --> 00:01:02,680
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan, I'm Jordan, we're a couple of dudes

4
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,800
like to sit around drink novelty beverages and talk a little tiny bit about Alex Jones.

5
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

6
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Jordan.

7
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
Dan!

8
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Jordan.

9
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
I have a quick question for you.

10
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
What's up?

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
What's your bright spot today?

12
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,800
My bright spot today is, I don't know, it's hard to find a bright spot, but a friend of

13
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,600
mine recommended a game called Hades.

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Hades?

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
I heard of that!

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Yeah.

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Yeah, it's like Diablo, maybe?

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Yeah, I guess.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
A little bit like that.

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
I haven't played Diablo.

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,600
I don't know.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,120
My friend Crane recommended it to me, and it's a lot of fun.

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,120
It's a lot of fun.

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,160
It's a good thing for background...slashin', hackin', doin' the whole thing.

25
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,540
I don't know.

26
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,480
It's a good thing for background entertainment.

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
I like it.

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
That's fantastic.

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,720
Yeah, so I mean like in times where it's tough for a bright spot, we've got another video

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
game.

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
Yeah.

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,720
What a shock.

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
We're inside!

34
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
Yeah.

35
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
How about you?

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,560
I have a bright spot, and also an incredibly dark spot.

37
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,680
My bright spot is that I found out that my parents had COVID and they survived with no...like,

38
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,200
they didn't have to go to the hospital.

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
That's...that's...

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
Fantastic.

41
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
I mean, comparatively?

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,200
Yes.

43
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Absolutely, yes.

44
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Compared to the alternative?

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
100%.

46
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,680
The unqualified dark spot, obviously, is that they learned zero from the experiment.

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,680
Absolutely nothing.

48
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,400
From the experiment, you say?

49
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
I don't mean experiment.

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
That implies that you...

51
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Experience!

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,240
I meant experience, but then I was like, they're all weird.

53
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,720
But...so...yeah!

54
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
So it's good.

55
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,960
It's the...they take the good and the bad.

56
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Yeah, it's good.

57
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
They're not gone.

58
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
No.

59
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,940
Also, I want to kill them.

60
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,000
So it's a real difficult situation that they've put me in.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah, that is tough.

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's a bind, Dan.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What are you gonna do?

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What are you gonna do?

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
At least they're not dead.

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's true.

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's nice!

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes!

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm hanging...it's a bright spot!

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Sure!

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Bright spot!

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes.

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Throw tomatoes at them!

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Throw tomatoes.

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Stock going up.

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Going up.

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,360
So, Jordan, today what we've got in front of us is a little bit of an after the action

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
report.

81
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
Ah, yes.

82
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
As it were.

83
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,960
On our last episode, we talked about the coverage on Infowars the day of January 6th.

84
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Right.

85
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,400
When some ding-dongs were storming the Capitol building.

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,480
Great day.

87
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,080
And so today we've got January 7th and 8th, the end of last week, how Alex tried to regroup

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,680
and try to figure out where are we going with this.

89
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,920
The post-coital bliss, if you will.

90
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,400
Um, I'm not positive.

91
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,920
There's a lot of stuff that's going on that I would describe as less than blissful.

92
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Less than blissful?

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
Alright.

94
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,000
Trying to figure out exactly how we're going to make it through and make this profitable.

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Sure, sure, sure.

96
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's a tough fight.

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,880
I'm interested to see what he's got.

98
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Yeah.

99
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,000
And we'll get down to business on that here in a second, but before we do, I'd like to

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,440
take a little moment to say thank you to some folks who have signed up on our sporting show.

101
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
Oh, that's a great idea.

102
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,160
So first, Amphheseum, thank you so much.

103
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,520
You are now a policy wonk.

104
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm a policy wonk!

105
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
Thanks, Amphheseum!

106
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
Thank you!

107
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,600
James modelingectorb, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

108
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
I'm a policy wonk!

109
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Thank you, Trevor!

110
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Thank you!

111
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,400
Next, Jayms, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

112
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
I'm a policy wonk!

113
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Thanks, Jayms!

114
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Thank you!

115
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,800
Next, George F, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

116
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
I'm a policy wonk!

117
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,180
Thank you very much, George!

118
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,180
Thank you!

119
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,260
Next, Nathalie, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

120
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,480
I'm a policy wonk.

121
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,500
Thanks, Nat!

122
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Thank you!

123
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,620
Next, Christopher L, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

124
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,720
I'm a policy wonk!

125
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,360
Thank you, conspiracy of Christopher's!

126
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
Oh, boy.

127
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,460
No, they have to shorten it up.

128
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,360
They have to shorten it up? You have to get it? I don't know if that's fair.

129
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,160
It's part of the entry requirement.

130
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,660
That's fair!

131
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,760
It's a holy ritual that the conspiracy of Chris's go on.

132
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,560
They have to physically chop off the all capitals Christopher and chop it.

133
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,360
Yeah, yeah, I get you.

134
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,660
Next, Emily T. Thank you so much. You're now a policy wonk.

135
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,060
I'm a policy wonk.

136
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,760
Thanks Emily!

137
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,160
Thank you!

138
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,960
And then finally, Brandy. Thank you so much. You're now a policy wonk.

139
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,260
I'm a policy wonk.

140
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,260
Thank you very much Brandy. It's Brandy.

141
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,960
Yeah, not the singer.

142
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,660
Oh, not Brandy?

143
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,460
No, the character from the Looking Glass.

144
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,560
Oh, well thank you very much Brandy!

145
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,060
Yeah.

146
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,660
It's good to hear from you. You were inside there for a while.

147
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,660
There's a port on a western bay that serves a hundred sailors a day.

148
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,660
A hundred ships a day.

149
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,360
Love me sailors with their time away thinking about their home.

150
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,260
I love it when you sing.

151
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,460
That's a great song.

152
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,660
Brandy, you're a fine girl. What a good wife you would be.

153
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,760
But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea.

154
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,360
Well, yes, naturally.

155
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,760
So anyway, thank you.

156
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,260
All right.

157
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,660
Jordan, today, I think that anybody who's tuning into this show is probably the most interested in,

158
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,860
or maybe, you know, the most like, what's, you know, because you see things on Twitter.

159
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,860
People have some primed, and something went around, and that was of course that Alex-

160
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,060
Yeah, people were wondering what video games you were playing, and you said Hades,

161
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,060
and then I've actually started it.

162
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,260
No, let's pack it in then.

163
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,760
Okay.

164
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,360
We've given the news report.

165
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,760
No, on Twitter, there was some stuff going around about Alex interviewing the Q shaman.

166
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,060
Oh, he did.

167
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,560
Yes.

168
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,060
Great.

169
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,560
Great.

170
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
So this episode-

171
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Helmet on or off?

172
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,260
It's hard to tell over the phone.

173
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,760
This episode will culminate with Alex interviewing the Q shaman.

174
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,960
Great, great, great.

175
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,160
And I'll give you this spoiler.

176
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,660
It doesn't go well.

177
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,460
Why not?

178
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,160
You know who it does go well for actually?

179
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,260
The FBI?

180
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,260
The Q shaman.

181
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,260
Okay, that's not good.

182
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,260
That's not good.

183
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:20,860
Turns out, you get the Q shaman on the line with Alex, he sounds not as bad as Alex.

184
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:30,660
Okay, so the guy dressed like fucking Dan Aykroyd in Dragnet is gonna kick Alex Jones' ass.

185
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,060
I'm sorry, let me be a little bit clearer about this.

186
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,560
Yeah.

187
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
They both sound crazy.

188
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Okay, well that's fair.

189
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,760
But, he sounds polite.

190
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,260
Okay.

191
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,460
Oh, like Dan Aykroyd in Dragnet.

192
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:40,960
Sure.

193
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,260
So, before we get to this episode, let's listen to a little out of context drop that actually

194
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,160
I think really, if you've never listened to Alex Jones' show, this almost perfectly sums

195
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,560
up what it's like to listen to him.

196
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,160
I'm gonna explain that next segment, baby.

197
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,960
That is Alex to a T.

198
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
I do like that in a news program.

199
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,960
You know, a lot of news programs just give you the news.

200
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Alex at least makes you work for it.

201
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,960
I got a story, it's huge, I'm gonna explain it to you later.

202
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Maybe.

203
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Possibly.

204
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,960
So, at this point we start on the 7th and Alex has learned that more people have passed

205
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,460
away in relation to the storming of the Capitol building.

206
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,460
Correct.

207
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,460
And also apparently he's doubling down on the It Was Antifa narrative.

208
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,460
Sure.

209
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,660
Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are here at the epicenter where four US citizens were

210
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:43,060
murdered inside and outside the US Capitol by the paramilitary forces there who were

211
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,360
manipulated and triggered by Antifa evidences mounting that posed as Proud Boys so that

212
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,660
they would then attack and so they could then trigger part of the crowd, hundreds of thousands

213
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,560
already massing, to get a small percentage inside the building.

214
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,960
So this is the way that the ball is gonna break for Alex, it's Antifa, they triggered

215
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,260
everything by posing as Proud Boys to set things off and I just, I don't know.

216
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,600
We should have had a contingent in every right-wing propagandist's home like the day after just

217
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,600
ready to slap, like, oh, say it was Antifa, say it was Antifa, just do it, just one more

218
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,520
time, just one more time, say it, and then when he does, slap, forever.

219
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,960
That slap is contingent on the person not being able to explain themselves.

220
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Yes.

221
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,360
I don't know, hey, look, if Alex is trying to come on air and say like, hey, facts are

222
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,320
coming out that this was Antifa.

223
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Totally.

224
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,240
I'd like for him to back that up.

225
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,000
Hey, if you prove it's Antifa, I will believe it's Antifa, Dan.

226
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,960
Well, he's got some intel that he's gonna repeat.

227
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,280
I'm keeping an open mind.

228
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
All right.

229
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,240
Let me read you some of the intel that some of our folks got us here in DC.

230
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,480
This is from a lot of different sources.

231
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,840
Antifa and other organizations promoted as always that they would dress in Trump apparel

232
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,360
to infiltrate the event, which is normal activity for them.

233
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Members from the security team did an advanced observation of the Capitol grounds prior to

234
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,960
Trump even arriving to confirm a stage that was set up for the speech and observation

235
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:22,800
for a group of 100 to 120 folks already assembled chanting F Antifa, dressed in a manner not

236
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,720
consistent with that normally seen from Trump supporters.

237
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,000
Everyone else who came from the event was at the ellipse waiting for Trump's speech.

238
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,040
They were wearing mainly kind of like gray overalls, arm pads, knee pads.

239
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Completely different.

240
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,320
They all kind of look like sons of Congressmen, sons of Senator Kaine was probably there.

241
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Oh yeah, that's crazy.

242
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
He was arrested here doing felony type stuff.

243
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,040
In fact, I would guess he was probably there.

244
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,280
The proof that he's laying out that this was Antifa is that there were people who were

245
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,920
dressed in a certain way.

246
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,400
Yeah, they looked a little different.

247
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,000
Uh, I just, I don't...

248
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,480
And Tim Kaine's son had a felony one time.

249
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
True.

250
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
So he was probably there.

251
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
He's probably there.

252
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,920
Everybody who's had a felony was probably there.

253
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
This just is thin.

254
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,440
Like it's just, it doesn't, and also I would say that him saying that, oh, they were chanting

255
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
fuck Antifa.

256
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Yeah.

257
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,640
It's kind of interesting because the night before Owen Schroyer posted that video of

258
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,600
himself burning a Black Lives Matter flag and everyone was chanting fuck Antifa.

259
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
It really does sound...

260
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,240
Well, but it sounds like exactly what you all engage in on a fairly regular basis.

261
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,440
Yeah, yeah.

262
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,020
You could say that this is Antifa doing an amazing impression of you, or it could be

263
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,420
people who are in the communities that you run in and it would be impossible to tell

264
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,760
the difference, I guess.

265
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,400
I would even argue at that point that if Antifa were at fault behind all of this, they might

266
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,720
as well just have joined the Proud Boys.

267
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,600
I don't want them back.

268
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Fair.

269
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Right?

270
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Yeah.

271
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,160
And so what's going on though is that Alex is recognizing that like, shit, I mean, this

272
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,600
is too real.

273
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
It happened.

274
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
I can't deny this.

275
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Yeah, I know.

276
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,800
We have to lie about it because I told people to do this and then they did it and I don't

277
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
want to get caught.

278
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,760
Well, we'll get into that because there are a lot of conversations that are going on around

279
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,840
Alex's behavior on the ground and stuff, and we should discuss that, and we will a little

280
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:23,320
bit later when Alex gets into it, but he would much rather be like, ah, this is all staged

281
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
or something.

282
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
But he can't.

283
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
No.

284
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
Because it happened.

285
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
False Flag would be so much better.

286
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Well, yeah.

287
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,440
And so it has to be that like, oh yeah, yeah, you know what?

288
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,240
Some of our people did end up going in there.

289
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,960
I'm not going to be able to deny that.

290
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
No.

291
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,640
Because they took pictures and streamed, and Gavin McGinnis was there apparently.

292
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,680
Look, they got tricked into doing it.

293
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,400
So that's what Andy said they were coming to do.

294
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,880
They're all trust fund kids, sons of U.S. senators, sons of Congress people, academics,

295
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:01,760
devil worshiping, child molesting, Chicom loving, America hating, trash of the planet.

296
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,480
And the police got attacked.

297
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,940
The police got hit.

298
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,960
They then came out when the crowd saw that and even said, let's get them.

299
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,160
Some patriots responded because they didn't want to be bullied and got suckered into this.

300
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
That's what happened.

301
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,480
Trump needs to go on the offense, start exposing this.

302
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Yeah.

303
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,520
So that's the way the narrative is starting to take shape.

304
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
Yeah.

305
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,680
It's not strong.

306
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:32,280
So I think that's kind of a struggle there because aren't we also trying to make a what's

307
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,340
her face into a martyr?

308
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,200
So was she- Well, Alex by this point has learned that

309
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
she was really into QAnon.

310
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
Right.

311
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,040
So she can be cut bait.

312
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
Well, no.

313
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,240
She is, you know, it is a tragedy and it's very sad.

314
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
Sure.

315
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,440
But she got tricked into doing this by QAnon.

316
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
Okay.

317
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:57,440
So now all open warfare on Q. QAnon may also be Antifa or a psyop or something.

318
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
I like this.

319
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
I don't know.

320
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Let's add this in there.

321
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
I like QAnon being Antifa.

322
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,600
Let's throw that in there.

323
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,400
It gets a little murky as these go along.

324
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Why not?

325
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,680
They don't have any allegiances.

326
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
Listen to me.

327
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:15,520
There's one thing that I know from blowhards and that is they like to talk about how they

328
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,120
could have averted disasters.

329
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Yes.

330
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Yeah.

331
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Yeah.

332
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
If only they had been there.

333
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Real Mark Wahlberg situation.

334
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
Exactly.

335
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Yeah.

336
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Yeah.

337
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
If he was on that plane, there wouldn't have been a 9-11.

338
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Wouldn't have happened.

339
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
No.

340
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
And we just should have been there.

341
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
I should have been there instead of at the Trump speech.

342
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,760
In fact, I was tempted to not go to the Trump speech and be at the Capitol.

343
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,640
I wanted to race down and not wait for Trump and get to the Capitol.

344
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,000
That's what my gut told me.

345
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,240
And we could have told people, that's Antifa, we could have tackled them, pulled off their

346
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
mask.

347
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,760
I would have happened to have been arrested and we would have stopped these pieces of

348
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
filth.

349
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,680
So yeah, he could have tackled all the Antifa.

350
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,160
If only Alex had been there.

351
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Oh boy.

352
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
He could have saved the day.

353
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,640
That's one of those lies that just elevated to the point of just like, nah.

354
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
Yeah.

355
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
Yeah.

356
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,920
Like I'm so far beyond the before you started that lie.

357
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,720
When you started that lie, I'm just out.

358
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
Yeah.

359
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:12,400
And if you go back to yesterday, when your employee said, the Capitol has fallen.

360
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
The Patriots are now in charge.

361
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,480
It's a new day, Dan.

362
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,200
Today the Patriots are not in charge.

363
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
So we can't celebrate.

364
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Shit got too real.

365
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
So that was Antifa.

366
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Yeah.

367
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
That was Antifa.

368
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Yeah.

369
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,600
So I'm interested in their evidence.

370
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,120
I'm interested in what they're going to bring to the table in terms of like, how are you

371
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,740
going to show that this is Antifa?

372
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,480
And Owen Troyer actually has a pretty interesting theory.

373
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,480
All right.

374
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
Yeah.

375
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,560
Keep in mind too, that, you know, every time we have these events in DC, you always see

376
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,640
Antifa and BLM out on the streets.

377
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,960
They are not anywhere to be seen in this week because they're all wearing Trump gear.

378
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,160
They're all posing as journalists.

379
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,000
They're all just infiltrating all the Trump stuff because they have no effect now dressing

380
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,240
in all black with black block going around, they get their ass kicked by proud boys.

381
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
The police are sick of them.

382
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,920
So now they pretend to be Patriots, they infiltrate and then they cause all this disruption.

383
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,400
I didn't see anybody who I decided was Antifa and therefore they must be hidden in plain

384
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,600
sight dressed like Trump supporters.

385
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Yeah.

386
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,800
Therefore they false flagged us.

387
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
This is so weird.

388
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,360
I have a serious question for you, Dan.

389
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,480
Are you trying to turn me into some sort of superhero vigilante with a tragic backstory?

390
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
No.

391
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:32,120
Because it seems like this is like listening to Owen say that the day after makes me want

392
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,400
to like dress in all black and train really hard and ninjutsu and then just solve problems

393
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
wherever they are.

394
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Right.

395
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
Right.

396
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,240
You know, I'm not trying to do that, but it seems like you're making it happen.

397
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,000
But if it does happen, I will say that you are required to be able to jump between a

398
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
couple of buildings before you solve any problems.

399
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Hold on.

400
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You can't prove it's me.

401
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,720
The pictures are grainy, Dan.

402
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,200
There's no evidence that it's me doing any of this.

403
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,680
I will be I will be your Alfred if you can jump between two buildings before you solve

404
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,680
anybody else's problem.

405
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,240
This is why I got to train for at least two or three years.

406
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,120
You might need a little more than two buildings, two years.

407
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,120
That's the rule.

408
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,000
So the name of the game is getting these talking points out into the world and making sure

409
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,320
that this is the reality that people accept muddy the waters, at least muddying the waters

410
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
is important.

411
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,240
But the other thing that I think Alex recognizes pretty quickly, and I think he's right, is

412
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,040
like, this is a great opportunity to try and get some Q people back.

413
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,360
Some people might be disillusioned by the fact that, like, they went through all this

414
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
trouble.

415
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
Nothing happened.

416
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,320
And then Trump, I guess, is conceding what what happened to the plan that happened to

417
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
the plan.

418
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,600
Tell me about those ballots again.

419
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,960
They were watermarked and Steve also conspicuous in his absence.

420
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Why?

421
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
No, Steve.

422
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
What?

423
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,680
We need to talk about talking points based in truth for the president, for America, for

424
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,280
the world, because we don't have any Patriot communications.

425
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,120
The president's been cut off, basically.

426
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,240
The White House is listening to us.

427
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
And it's not because we're powerful.

428
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
It's because Trump is surrounded.

429
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
OK.

430
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,240
And I keep telling everybody, you think he was great.

431
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,240
You don't have to do anything.

432
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Trust the plan.

433
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Everything's wonderful.

434
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
That's what's gotten us into this position.

435
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
OK.

436
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,400
I'm not basking if you were a Q person.

437
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,960
I'm just telling you now that you have to listen to the talking points.

438
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,280
We have to discuss who was behind this moving now on the offense instead of being on the

439
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
defense.

440
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,920
This is a nice way to extend an olive branch to any listeners who might have drifted more

441
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,720
Q than Alex and be like, you can still come back here.

442
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,600
There's nothing against you if you got into this, because it's all supposed to be asking

443
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,080
questions.

444
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:48,220
This event almost is like a plus one for everybody's media consumption.

445
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,120
If you were a Q person, you go plus one to Info Wars.

446
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,720
If you're Info Wars, you go plus one to Fox News.

447
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,280
And if you're at Fox News, you're like, I have no home, I'll just believe whatever I

448
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
feel like.

449
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Maybe.

450
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Yeah.

451
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
Yeah.

452
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,080
Maybe there's a sort of like a toe back towards, like, away from the extremism.

453
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,480
For a brief period of time.

454
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,000
And also for people on their couches.

455
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Sure.

456
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,160
Not necessarily the people who were in DC.

457
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
Sure.

458
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
No, no, no.

459
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
That's what I'm referencing.

460
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Yeah.

461
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
You know.

462
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Possibly.

463
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,800
I mean, I think we haven't had enough time to see what the actual effects of it are.

464
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,800
But the way that I hear Alex talking about this stuff and the way I see him behaving,

465
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,560
it has the feeling of somebody who sees an opportunity.

466
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,820
And it's an opportunity to get part of that market share that he lost back from all these

467
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:42,720
QAnon folks who think that he is controlled opposition and works for the Mossad or the

468
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,720
CIA or whatever.

469
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Right.

470
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Right, right, right.

471
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
And so, I mean, good.

472
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Not good.

473
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,920
But that's what you should be doing from a business standpoint.

474
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,920
Yeah.

475
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Yeah.

476
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,160
Dan, now do you see where the vigilante part comes into this?

477
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:00,320
Because if Alex winds up getting more market share out of this and no one stops him, I

478
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,700
feel like there needs to be some sort of all-black-clad ninjutsu master who has trained for two years

479
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,240
and can jump exactly two buildings to solve that problem.

480
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,880
But the way you would solve that problem is by, like, starting your own-

481
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
Ninjutsu!

482
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,880
No, I'm starting your own right-wing media outlet.

483
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,040
Okay.

484
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,080
So not even, like, Judo?

485
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,060
No, you should steal some of Alex's market share.

486
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,960
If the problem that you're seeking to solve is that.

487
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
All right.

488
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Okay.

489
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,880
So I'll just wear all black and have a radio show at night.

490
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Yeah, there you go.

491
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
That's the same thing.

492
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
Yeah.

493
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,560
So the Capitol Police, you know, there's a lot of questions that are going around about

494
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,000
their preparedness, their lack of preparedness.

495
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,240
You know, and I think that, you know, we'll learn more in coming days.

496
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,240
Sure.

497
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,880
They decided that they were understaffed on purpose because they were working on this

498
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,120
with Antifa or something.

499
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,120
Okay.

500
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,880
Antifa came in, they had the Capitol understaffed on purpose.

501
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,280
You can see the setup.

502
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,800
They attacked, the police finally pushed back, Antifa pulls out, the police attacked the

503
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,660
Patriots, the Patriots attack, and it was all a setup.

504
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,400
They beautifully played, we need this to be investigated by state police, by citizens,

505
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,520
by grand juries, by investigative journalists.

506
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,800
The FBI is not going to do it.

507
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,080
I mean, I bet Bill Barr was probably in command of this.

508
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,200
Well, and the state police are going to do anything either.

509
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,440
They're all funded by Soros and they have Soros DA so they know there's nothing that's

510
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
going to be done.

511
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,440
Yeah.

512
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,480
You talked over, but he did say Antifa works for the deep state.

513
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
Yeah.

514
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
Yeah.

515
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
Yeah.

516
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Yep.

517
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
Okay.

518
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Hey, far right guys, go fight those cops.

519
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,480
Go fight them.

520
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
Go do it.

521
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
There are your enemies.

522
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
There are your enemies.

523
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,480
The left.

524
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,480
We were Antifa.

525
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,040
Look, Antifa in this circumstance did exactly what the far right wanted.

526
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
Right?

527
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,440
Well, if you look at the responses that were going on as it was happening before shit got

528
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
too real.

529
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,680
Um, yeah, I think, I think it was exactly what, so maybe Antifa has been your ally all

530
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,720
along and it's the cops who are your enemy.

531
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
Very confusing.

532
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
Yes.

533
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,040
So, um, after this all went down, um, Trump pretty quickly on the seventh was put, he

534
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,120
put out that video, uh, where he was like, well, there's going to be a transfer of power

535
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
in a more or less conceding.

536
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Yeah.

537
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,800
It was a great little whoopsie doodle moment.

538
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Yeah.

539
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:22,840
And Alex, I think he recognizes that like Trump is running out of allies.

540
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,600
There are people who are like in his cabinet who are resigning.

541
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,400
There's just a sense of like, Oh no, everyone hates this guy now.

542
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,600
And I think Alex sees this as an opportunity.

543
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,640
What do we do as millions of listeners, as millions of activists with talking points

544
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,020
and narratives to counter what's happening?

545
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,720
What pressure do we put on Trump and Congress because Trump's totally been, uh, abandoned

546
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
now.

547
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
Now that sounds bad.

548
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
That's actually good.

549
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,880
Tell me on this banded by all the snakes around him that now Alex Jones led a March.

550
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,540
Now we're running the show the next 15 days.

551
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,880
He can do so much now to counter them.

552
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Regardless.

553
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,600
We're going to talk about it in the second hour, but pray for awakening.

554
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:10,300
Hey, uh, this aspiring dictator is a isolated and increasingly desperate and this is good

555
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,520
news because, uh, Hey, uh, everyone else is gone and maybe he'll listen to me now.

556
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
True.

557
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
That does sound right.

558
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
That's fucked.

559
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Yeah.

560
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
Yeah.

561
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,720
I guess the good news is that we know the vice president will be like, Hey, don't send

562
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,840
those nukes.

563
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,920
Don't do that.

564
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,600
You don't need, uh, don't send those nukes.

565
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,920
Oh, that's until Trump 25th amendments him.

566
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,720
Oh, that'll be interesting.

567
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,920
That'll be an interesting reversal of fortune.

568
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
Yeah.

569
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,120
So Alex is kind of obsessed with the 25th amendment stuff and he's decided that Trump

570
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,600
only released that video where he may or may not have conceded because Pence was threatening

571
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,160
him, uh, with the 25th amendment.

572
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:51,360
That's probably the phones up and take calls specifically on what you think with 13 days

573
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Trump should do.

574
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,360
Has he conceded?

575
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,360
You can read his tweet.

576
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,260
He said, I think we have the elections stolen.

577
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:01,400
I'm not agreeing to this fraud, but I will agree to the peaceful transference of power

578
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,480
because they told him we got Mike Pence.

579
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,640
We got the rest of your cabinet.

580
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
They're all cowards.

581
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,440
Well, 25th amendment, you're asked right now, they only did that because removing him would

582
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,040
cause a bigger backlash.

583
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,720
Maybe Trump should force them to do a 25th amendment.

584
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,560
Not because he's going to not peacefully transfer power, but because it's a fraud.

585
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,920
So they're scared of the power he still got.

586
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,080
The feeling that I get there is just denial.

587
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Yeah.

588
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,760
That just seems like pretty thick denial.

589
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
Yeah.

590
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,640
And uh, that denial goes away by the eighth.

591
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,160
Alex does realize, ah, this is over.

592
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
Yeah.

593
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,440
On the seventh, there's still a sense of like, oh no, he's just doing this cause there's

594
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,960
a metaphorical gun to his head.

595
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,400
He's five stages of griefing.

596
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Yes.

597
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Yeah.

598
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Gotcha.

599
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Gotcha.

600
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
And he does get into some anger, which is kind of fun.

601
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,560
And then more anger when he talks to the Q shaman.

602
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,520
Was bargaining before anger or after anger?

603
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,400
Uh, bargaining is the, uh, the ad pivots.

604
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,640
Oh, so we're, that would make sense that he's always grieving.

605
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Yeah.

606
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Keep me on air.

607
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Yeah.

608
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
And we'll fight the globalists.

609
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Yeah.

610
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
That's bargaining.

611
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
No, that's fair.

612
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,320
So Alex has Taylor Hanson back on who was the guy who got some video of the shooting

613
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,760
in the, in the Capitol.

614
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
Fourth Hanson brother.

615
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Yeah.

616
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
Yes.

617
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,760
Uh, mmm, bop.

618
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
Uh, no.

619
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
Oh, almost a spit take.

620
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,760
Almost.

621
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,800
I was almost a spit take.

622
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
You got me.

623
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,360
Um, I apologize.

624
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,520
I made that clarification in our last episode that I got it mixed up.

625
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,960
They're very vague in, uh, or they were on the sixth while they were covering stuff.

626
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
Yeah.

627
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,480
There are two pieces of video that are going, uh, around and I got the reference wrong on

628
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
them.

629
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,320
There's one that was shot by info Wars, uh, uh, camera person.

630
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,200
And then there's some that was shot by Taylor Hanson.

631
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,200
Right.

632
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,520
The reason that I got it confused is they never clarify that and they interview Taylor

633
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,880
Hanson as somebody who got video of the stuff around the time that they're playing the video

634
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,440
that the info Wars person got.

635
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
Right.

636
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,920
And they made a, a hasty assumption.

637
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
They weren't helping.

638
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,280
No, but he's back and, uh, they're really, I get the sense that they're working on a

639
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,200
narrative where, uh, Chuck Schumer, uh, called for the killing.

640
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Love it.

641
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,200
All right.

642
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Taylor Hanson was there.

643
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
I'm Alex Jones.

644
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
I'm Troyer.

645
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,600
You were there, uh, when this poor lady, Ashley Babbitt got executed along with three other

646
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Americans.

647
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,740
They wanted to tell us their names.

648
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,440
They're calling us the terrorists, but they were killing us.

649
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
You were there.

650
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,360
Describe, you talked to her before she died.

651
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,360
What happened?

652
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,360
What you witnessed.

653
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,960
And the fact that you saw Chucky Schumer look like it was his security detail that he was,

654
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,680
I guess, one of the blood sacrifices we know, remember he threatened Trump.

655
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
He said, have you been abortion?

656
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
We will annihilate you.

657
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
You will pay.

658
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,480
It was like, well, these are our babies, baby feast.

659
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
He seemed to get really upset.

660
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,520
Oh yeah.

661
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,280
Baby feast.

662
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,000
I would watch that movie.

663
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,400
I just, is that like boss baby, but lunchtime, a little bit different.

664
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Oh.

665
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
I don't know, man.

666
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,600
It's very much not boss baby.

667
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
I don't know.

668
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,200
I don't find this to be a responsible line for him to be taking.

669
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,720
It's like trying to imply that Schumer was like, kill her for blood, blood sacrifice.

670
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Yeah.

671
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,320
It's very, very shitty.

672
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,160
It is, it is real weird whenever you're like, Hey, it was Antifa who did all that.

673
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,760
Now obviously we need to get all the Patriots to kill Chuck Schumer to keep Antifa from

674
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,960
doing all of that stuff that we wanted to happen, but we said we didn't.

675
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
Yeah.

676
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,200
It is really almost like a thing you have to diagram in your head.

677
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,600
The points that are trying to be made are so confusing, but that should be expected

678
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,640
because you know, people like Taylor are involved as like sources of information and analysis.

679
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,480
And he's the kind of guy who got into this because of Q.

680
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,520
I believe Q, like what you were saying, Alex, it was a great thing when it first started,

681
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,840
you know, it was, it was a way to introduce people to all the evils of what these globalists

682
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,760
are doing and all this pedophilia, all this satanic worship, all these sacrifices.

683
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,440
And that's how I personally got red pilled, but it led to me doing more independent research.

684
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,640
And I think that's, what's great about Q is they do their own research.

685
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,800
They don't just trust fake news.

686
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,760
And I think that was a great topic about it, but the real downfall of it was trust the

687
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
plan.

688
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,160
As you said, you know, you got people staying home when Trump himself are telling them to

689
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
come.

690
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,280
So he's got a, he got red pilled by QAnon and his only complaint about it is that trust

691
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,560
the plan idea, which is like, you don't have to get active.

692
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
Right.

693
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,560
Right.

694
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,520
But then his comment was that more people should have come on the 6th?

695
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,800
Apparently, yeah.

696
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Okay.

697
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
But.

698
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Okay.

699
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
But what happened was bad.

700
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,640
Well, no, everything that happened was good except for the part where they went into the

701
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Capitol.

702
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,640
Okay.

703
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,200
And stormed it and did all that stuff.

704
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,520
So they think that if more people had been there to storm the Capitol.

705
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,160
No, it wouldn't have happened because they would have seen the Antifa provocateurs.

706
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,560
Like every single person is a pair of eyes.

707
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
Okay.

708
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,880
Any one of those pairs of eyes could have been the one that spotted the Antifa provocateurs

709
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
and averted this whole thing.

710
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
All right.

711
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,520
One man, if one man had been there named Alex Jones, he would have tackled them.

712
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,560
So it's a percentages thing.

713
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,560
Something like that.

714
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
I don't know.

715
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Sure.

716
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
Sure.

717
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
Great.

718
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
Great.

719
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
Great.

720
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Great.

721
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,560
Great.

722
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,440
It's like the Antifa pulling a false flag on us.

723
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Yeah.

724
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
That's the way it's being presented.

725
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,400
It's really, really frustrating.

726
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Yeah.

727
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:36,160
And it's pretty frustrating too because it's almost one of the first instances I think

728
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,240
I can think of of Alex showing some vulnerability.

729
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,560
Like he's just yelling about how Antifa kicked their ass.

730
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,000
I'm kicking myself because they were gonna false flag.

731
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
They said they were.

732
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And I was so busy focusing on Trump and a million people that we let them screw us.

733
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,200
And I don't admit that Antifa kicked our ass and set us up with a gigantic victory because

734
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
I'm proud for him.

735
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,200
I don't want it to happen next time.

736
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Well, and the problem was-

737
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
I'm pissed off.

738
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,280
The problem was it was a million of us there.

739
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,220
It was a million of us there.

740
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,220
He does have to piss.

741
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,220
I'm sorry.

742
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,220
He just left.

743
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,220
It's a real angry piggy.

744
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,220
It's a real angry piggy.

745
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,220
Yeah.

746
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,220
Yeah.

747
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,480
You know, when you're getting older, your prostate gets all inflamed when you get all

748
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,120
angry, hopped up on so much fucking.

749
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
Yeah.

750
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,920
A false flag bathroom break.

751
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Yeah.

752
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
He does actually go to the bathroom.

753
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,440
And while he's out, Taylor is still there.

754
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,120
And he's also on the same script, which is this like bringing some of these Q people

755
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,560
into this fold.

756
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,520
And I know a lot of people that still believe in Q.

757
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,080
I mean, I have a lot of friends, you know, I have family that believe in Q, and now you're

758
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,080
seeing them freak out.

759
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,800
You know, I was on Twitter scrolling through last night because I was wondering the same

760
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
thing, you know.

761
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,360
After, I mean, because Trump basically conceded last night.

762
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,320
He told the entire nation that he's going to turn it over to Joe Biden and he's going

763
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,520
to be the president of the United States, which is not the plan.

764
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,840
So these people are freaking out already.

765
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,200
I mean, yeah, some of them probably are kind of being a little bit biased and wanting to

766
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,520
trust the plan still, but that's not going to work.

767
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,260
All it was was a plan to keep us complacent, a plan to not keep us on the streets doing

768
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:11,200
activism that can actually make a change and a positive impact to help Donald Trump.

769
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,320
You guys went home.

770
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,120
You could have stayed out on the streets.

771
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,320
It's true.

772
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,640
You remember in Portland?

773
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,640
Yeah.

774
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,640
They stayed out on the streets.

775
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,440
Antifa didn't stop them.

776
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,600
But Alex did tell people to respect the curfew.

777
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Yeah.

778
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Yeah.

779
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
Yeah.

780
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Yeah.

781
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,360
So I think it was Alex who took them off the streets.

782
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,360
Yeah.

783
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
I don't know.

784
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,840
I just, I find this all to be really sad.

785
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,680
Yeah, it is.

786
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:43,560
Just sad posturing among right-wing scam artists, trying to stake their claim on victims, you

787
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,520
know, just trying to stake their claim on people who they can manipulate.

788
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,240
And it's a bummer.

789
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,280
It's a reshuffling.

790
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,200
It's like the tide came in.

791
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,520
But it's also like, you think about that and it's like, well, it's pretty, it seems pretty

792
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,400
clear to me looking at this, that it's kind of what's going on.

793
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Yeah.

794
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,240
And, and I don't know how you could hear a clip like this and think that any of your

795
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,400
like preferred right-wing media outlets have any integrity.

796
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,760
How big is that, Owen, that Obama says, we've got to shut down the alternative media ecosystem.

797
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,320
They listed Infowars.

798
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,600
They listed Newsmax, who's not even, they're okay.

799
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,940
They listed OAN, who's great.

800
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,720
They listed Gateway Pundit.

801
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
I mean, there's not many people out there.

802
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,600
Hey, Drudge used to be a great guy, came to studio, knows what's going on.

803
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,480
Trump wouldn't financially support him or whatever.

804
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,080
He got, let's CNN buy him out, I'm told.

805
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,860
My point is there's not many holdouts out there.

806
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:39,260
So the entire right-wing media ecosystem was largely driven by Drudge for a very long time.

807
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,920
For the last, since the Clintons.

808
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
Basically, yes.

809
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
Yeah.

810
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,880
I remember my dad reading Drudge in the nineties.

811
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,880
Yeah.

812
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,000
And it really warped a lot of the media line in shows like Rush and Hannity.

813
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

814
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,880
If it weren't for Drudge, we probably wouldn't be in the same situation we're in.

815
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,200
It was a clearing house for the talking points of the right-wing.

816
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,280
And now Alex is suggesting that he doesn't like Trump anymore because Trump wouldn't

817
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
pay him off.

818
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
Yeah.

819
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
What the fuck?

820
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,280
No, you get it?

821
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,280
Yeah.

822
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:17,200
Because if the president doesn't pay you off for good coverage, then it's your responsibility

823
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,560
as a principled person to sell to CNN.

824
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,880
And that will completely alter your coverage.

825
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,360
No, no, no, no, no, no.

826
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:30,120
It's all about, look, your integrity never stays... Dan, you know, like if we suddenly

827
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:36,160
took a shit ton of money from, I don't know, let's say Jeff Bezos, obviously our coverage

828
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,920
wouldn't change.

829
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,400
I'd replace you with an Echo.

830
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
I'm Dan.

831
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
I'm Alexa.

832
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,840
Dan, we love your show.

833
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,720
We're going to give you $20 million, but that... You know the guy.

834
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,200
You know, the white... I think maybe get rid of him.

835
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,280
Jordan, we're going to replace it.

836
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,220
We're going to transfer his consciousness into Amazon Echo.

837
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,760
That way we can turn him off.

838
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
Yeah.

839
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,960
I don't have to say neighbors anymore.

840
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
I can turn the volume.

841
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Yes, exactly.

842
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:17,120
So yeah, I mean, I just... I don't understand how anybody can think that they have any kind

843
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,920
of... Calling it alternative media is laughable when you're like, Matt Drudge didn't get money

844
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,600
from Trump, so he- So he sold to CNN.

845
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Yeah.

846
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
That's alternative.

847
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,600
So he turned on him.

848
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,160
Your alternative is the highest bidder?

849
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
Yeah.

850
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
Yeah.

851
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,760
In this next clip, I just kept in, because they're just like, no fucking way.

852
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,560
Alex takes some calls, and this guy, no way.

853
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
No way.

854
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
I got you.

855
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
I hear you.

856
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,120
And also too, I don't know if these numbers were accurate, but I was watching everything

857
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,400
live on your radio show yesterday, and congratulations, because this showed that you had 1.6 billion

858
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
viewers.

859
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,400
And that's amazing.

860
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,780
Congratulations, man.

861
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,780
That just warmed my heart.

862
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,780
I snapshotted it.

863
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,780
1.6 billion.

864
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,780
Hold on.

865
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,240
I'm writing something down.

866
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,400
I need to add exclamation points real quick.

867
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,000
It is... The first word is no.

868
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,160
All right.

869
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,880
Let me add the second exclamation point, and it is way.

870
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
No way.

871
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
That would be no way.

872
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
No way.

873
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
No way.

874
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Two exclamation points.

875
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
No way.

876
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
One for each word.

877
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
1.6 billion listeners to Infowars, simultaneous- From where?

878
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
From where?

879
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
It's just a radio show.

880
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
Yeah.

881
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
It's not happening.

882
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Okay.

883
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:37,720
So we end here on this next clip from January 7th, and I got to say, I found this episode

884
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,400
to be largely unlistenable.

885
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,880
I really didn't even think it was a show.

886
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,080
It kind of felt like Alex trying to figure out what the narrative was going to be, and

887
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,080
it's just like, all right, Antifa did this.

888
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:54,280
They tricked us by instigating, and then they went away, and all the Patriots got really

889
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:00,040
excited, and they had to fight back because now the police were attacking them.

890
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,180
He's sort of talking through it to get his bearings about it, and it's not an interesting

891
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,180
show at all.

892
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,180
Yeah.

893
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,960
It's a man licking his wounds in the posture of somebody who won.

894
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,440
Well, and trying to figure out what's damage control, what's the angle that we can move

895
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
forward with.

896
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,440
Right.

897
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,440
Right.

898
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,760
And at the end of the episode, he's pretty clear that he doesn't really have a problem

899
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
with what happened.

900
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,760
Yeah, folks.

901
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,760
America's gone.

902
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,420
We killed all the babies.

903
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,120
We devil worshiped, and God took his support away.

904
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,720
We've got to fight back and take it back, and so I want to say this.

905
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,760
I'm proud of the folks who went to the Capitol, quite frankly, that Capitol is so evil.

906
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,920
People under the Declaration of Independence had a right to absolutely burn to the ground.

907
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,440
I don't support that because I don't think this is my right move.

908
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,680
I want to take it back politically, but the point is, is that we're not the ones burning

909
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,840
down police stations and killing people.

910
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,280
We're responding to that.

911
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,280
They started it, the globalists started it, and we're not ashamed of anything, and Trump

912
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,000
should come out and expose Antifa for triggering the riots and stand up against it.

913
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,720
So that's sort of where we're at.

914
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,760
I think a lot of people would 100% believe Trump if he just said that it was Antifa.

915
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Oh, sure.

916
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,160
I think it would be easy, because remember the address that he gave before the riot?

917
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,880
I mean the storming of the Capitol building of the United States of America, a nuclear

918
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,880
power?

919
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,880
Yeah.

920
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,040
So he said all those things that were like, I bet it's going to be Antifa who's going

921
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,860
to take over the Capitol building in just a short period of time, and so this will prove

922
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,080
him correct.

923
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,420
I mean, there is a rich tradition of people blaming their enemies for things.

924
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,800
It does seem very easy to do.

925
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
Yeah.

926
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
Yeah.

927
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,320
I think you're, I mean I hate to say that I think you're right, that you probably could

928
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
pull it off.

929
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,320
Yeah, that's true.

930
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,000
To a certain audience.

931
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Right.

932
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Right, right, right.

933
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,400
Which would be 80% of Republicans.

934
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,580
At this point.

935
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:55,440
So Alex, now on the 8th, on Friday, he starts off his show with a bit of a different tone.

936
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,520
I think he's accepted at this point that Trump has conceded.

937
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,320
All right, the Globaliscus Info operatives do not want you to take political action.

938
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,280
They want to freeze you right now, believing everything's fine.

939
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,720
It's not, Trump is not in a secret location in Texas, he is surrounded in the White House.

940
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,080
That is not a CG video.

941
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:21,820
The president did concede the election yesterday, last night.

942
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,800
So he is up to speed with reality somewhat.

943
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,800
Right, right.

944
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,320
New lines, new text messages from the people who tell him that Trump conceded.

945
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,200
I believe that they're, you know, I don't keep up to date fully on the Q stuff, but

946
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,240
it's my understanding that some people were speculating that it was a deep fake or something

947
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,240
like that.

948
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,240
Sure, sure.

949
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,240
I like that.

950
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,240
The video of Trump conceded.

951
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

952
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
Alex is not into that.

953
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,120
At this point, on the 8th, there were pictures coming out, and a lot of the people who were

954
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,200
there and look very suspicious.

955
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
Antifa.

956
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,300
Well, maybe.

957
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,240
But they also seem to be wearing like Oath Keepers shirts, and they kind of look like

958
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,240
a militia.

959
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,240
Oh, yeah.

960
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,560
Who could, who dresses like a militia other than Antifa, Dan?

961
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
Right.

962
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,560
So Alex has to now incorporate that into the cover of it.

963
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,800
So Antifa started it, which we've established here on the 7th, and now as we get into the

964
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,520
8th, Alex has to explain why there's also militia people there doing shit.

965
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,520
It's tough to explain.

966
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,520
Oh, it's all Trump's fault.

967
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,480
Oh, he got the big crowd there to do this.

968
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,360
No, he was not even done speaking.

969
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,980
He hadn't even started speaking.

970
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,980
You were there.

971
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:33,820
Before Antifa dressed up as patriots started attacking with another contingent of older

972
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:38,080
looking people who I believe will end up being a militia controlled by feds.

973
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,360
And militias are constitutional.

974
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,360
They're not bad.

975
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,880
I'm not saying militias are bad.

976
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,760
I'm saying they lead them, they set them up, and they create false ones.

977
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,160
And looking at the MO, the body language, the gear, the behavior, I believe it'll be

978
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,400
a militia led by feds.

979
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,320
That's my prime analysis, almost always exactly accurate.

980
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,560
That sounds almost exactly like what he was saying about the Boston bombing, sort of like,

981
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,000
oh, I look at the body language on these people, they're like, get the fuck out of here, just

982
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
making shit up.

983
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,840
Have we heard, how is our boy Stuart Rhodes doing?

984
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,280
Have we heard from him?

985
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,480
Also conspicuous in his absence.

986
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,960
Oh, he's conspicuous in his absence?

987
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Why?

988
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
I don't know.

989
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
It seems like Alex would want to get him on as an expert.

990
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:19,320
I mean, he's the Oathkeeper who could say more than anyone else, those guys are not

991
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,320
Oathkeepers.

992
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,480
Yeah, yeah, you could give a full throated defense of his organization.

993
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,280
Must be Antifa, Oathkeepers are peaceful.

994
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,320
He seems to maybe not be answering Alex's calls.

995
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,320
Oh, that's weird.

996
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,200
There seems to be a limited guest pool that has led Alex to interviewing the Q shaman.

997
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,560
Yeah, that would get you to where you are.

998
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,560
On this episode.

999
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,560
Yeah.

1000
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:46,840
Alex is really mad at Q stuff on this episode, but he's, again, very much not wanting to

1001
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,280
alienate the Q people.

1002
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,520
You can still redeem yourself basically, but also Q made this happen, this whole fucking

1003
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,520
thing.

1004
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,520
Sure.

1005
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
But it's Antifa.

1006
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,520
Well, yes, but Antifa wouldn't have been able to pull it off if it weren't for the dumb

1007
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,400
Q people who stormed the building.

1008
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,040
I want to learn ninjutsu.

1009
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,960
But there was another ingredient that allowed this to happen.

1010
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,160
It wasn't just the Antifa.

1011
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,040
It wasn't just the sheep dipped militia.

1012
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,200
It was the Q.

1013
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,700
The Air Force veteran, a wonderful woman, Mrs. Babbitt, loved her country, believed

1014
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:29,760
she was storming it under Q orders of the president.

1015
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,520
And so it was the Q people right behind Antifa that did this.

1016
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,640
And that is the facts, it doesn't mean if you like the Q stuff, you're bad.

1017
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,880
It doesn't mean that anything esoteric like, oh, drive your dump truck to the Hoover Dam,

1018
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,080
drive your train off the thing into the ship.

1019
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:53,320
Hillary secretly in Gitmo, Trump's invincible, Pence is on our side, Attorney General Barr

1020
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
is on our side.

1021
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
Everything's wonderful.

1022
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Go to sleep.

1023
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,320
Trump's invincible.

1024
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,320
Don't worry about voting.

1025
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,800
And now you see it.

1026
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,840
So there you go.

1027
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:07,220
Kind of saying Trump is invincible, literally, I don't think any of those things are things

1028
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,560
that Alex hasn't said.

1029
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,560
Pence is on our side.

1030
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,920
That's been a narrative on Infowars for some time.

1031
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,480
Bill Barr would go back and forth, Alex would turn him villain and hero pretty regularly.

1032
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,480
That was hot and cold.

1033
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,480
All over the place.

1034
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,400
That was an intense relationship, yeah.

1035
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,760
I don't think you should be allowed to say that wonderful woman if I know, and you know

1036
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,800
in your heart that if you and your son and Gavin McGinnis were around, you'd be like,

1037
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,960
I know she's dead, but she's got great tits.

1038
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,560
So you don't get to say that.

1039
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,560
That's what I feel like.

1040
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,600
That's just me.

1041
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
That's fair.

1042
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:49,640
So Alex has a source in the media about the fact that Antifa infiltrated the rally.

1043
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,960
And it comes from the old New York Post.

1044
00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:01,600
Bo Brooks and Gaetz, and said they were briefed that Antifa was planning to pose as patriots

1045
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
and do it.

1046
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,000
That's what Matt Gaetz gets into as well.

1047
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:12,320
Well, now we have the New York Post, we can put it on screen, saying two people were arrested.

1048
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:17,440
They've confirmed we're posing as Make America Great Again people with Make America Great

1049
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,480
Again hats.

1050
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,420
So the headline of this isn't about them being arrested, it says, quote, two known Antifa

1051
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,840
members posed as pro-Trump to infiltrate Capitol riot sources.

1052
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,720
So it's a claim from sources.

1053
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,880
And it's awesome, too, like if you just get to the fourth paragraph of the story, you

1054
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,880
find this.

1055
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,520
Quote, a Washington Times report initially claimed two other protesters were actually

1056
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,860
Philadelphia-based Antifa members, citing a retired military officer with access to

1057
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,860
facial recognition software.

1058
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,400
But the outlet deleted the article after the software company told BuzzFeed News that the

1059
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,440
story was outright false.

1060
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Huh.

1061
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,440
Huh.

1062
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,240
Yeah, so it's kind of an article that has a nice headline for Alex, but it actually

1063
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,240
means nothing.

1064
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,240
Wow.

1065
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,680
Yeah, and he goes on and on about that, how like two people were arrested that are known

1066
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,920
Antifa based on this New York Post story, and I don't know.

1067
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,160
I think I hate this just so much because you can see the conversation that happened.

1068
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,040
Like you can read that and go, oh, okay, here's what happened.

1069
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,000
Somebody went to somebody higher up who was like, oh shit, they did it.

1070
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
What do we do?

1071
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
What do we do?

1072
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Oh, just put, it was Antifa.

1073
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
That's it.

1074
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Like they didn't think about it.

1075
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,320
They didn't come up with some brilliant plan.

1076
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,880
They were just like, just say Antifa did it and we'll wait and see what happens.

1077
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,880
And it's disappointing.

1078
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,880
Probably.

1079
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,880
Yeah.

1080
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,960
So we continue down the road.

1081
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,800
One of the things that is stuck from the seventh into the eighth is that Trump only conceded

1082
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:52,260
because he had a metaphorical gun to his head Pence threatened the 25th amendment removal

1083
00:43:52,260 --> 00:44:02,980
of Trump yesterday morning and afternoon and said, if you don't go take a message, decrying

1084
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:08,680
your supporters and decrying the whole thing and saying you'll allow a peaceful transition

1085
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:14,480
of power to Joe Biden, which he'd already put out as a, as a tweet that morning, we

1086
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,680
are going to remove you.

1087
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,640
We have the cabinet votes right now to remove you under the 25th amendment.

1088
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,980
They were just looking for the excuse only for the pretext.

1089
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,720
So this is the way that you get around the fact that Trump was yelling about how like,

1090
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,340
uh, you know, I'm never going to back down and he's like, all right, yeah, because otherwise

1091
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,960
you kind of gotta be like, oh, he was just full of shit.

1092
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:42,480
And also it would be a really difficult thing to justify that like, why was, why if he does

1093
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,640
have evidence that this was a false and fraudulent election, why would he ever back down?

1094
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,200
Now he is backing down.

1095
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,120
That would seem to imply that either he was lying or he's the sort of person who would

1096
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,000
allow a fraudulent election to stand.

1097
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It does seem like that.

1098
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And that's tough.

1099
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,640
And the only way around that is, Hey man, Pence, he had a metaphorical gun to his head

1100
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,000
that had a label that said 25th amendment.

1101
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Yeah.

1102
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,520
But Pence's metaphorical gun only happened because you held a literal gun to him.

1103
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,360
You know, they're not going to wrestle with this.

1104
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:18,080
That's the, I just, I just, it's so frustrating because if like an eco terrorist blew up the

1105
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:23,920
Capitol building and killed a bunch of people, I wouldn't be like, Hey, listen, we got a

1106
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,940
like, no, goodbye.

1107
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,120
You don't get to do that.

1108
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,120
No.

1109
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,120
Yeah.

1110
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,120
I love the climate too, man.

1111
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,120
But no.

1112
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,120
Yeah.

1113
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,120
It's not hard.

1114
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,880
It doesn't seem like it should be.

1115
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,440
But at the same time, you don't make a lot of money scamming people around the ideas

1116
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,440
of climate change.

1117
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,440
God.

1118
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,440
I should.

1119
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,440
Yeah.

1120
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,440
That's the, that's the thing.

1121
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:49,680
Alex has a house of cards that he's built, uh, that it can get knocked over, uh, that

1122
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,680
he has to protect.

1123
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,680
Yeah.

1124
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,680
Is Sean King busy?

1125
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,640
I could probably work for him scaring people about, uh, yeah.

1126
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:02,720
So Alex, uh, was there at the Capitol building for a time on the sixth provably.

1127
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,720
Yes he was.

1128
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:09,000
And a lot of people were reporting that he was trying to incite a riot.

1129
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,480
Um, and it was my sense from watching the entirety of info wars over the course of the

1130
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,480
day.

1131
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,380
I, what I expressed on our last episode is exactly what I feel.

1132
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:24,920
He was definitely saying things that look really bad in hindsight, but once shit popped

1133
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:31,480
off real seriously, I didn't see him inciting people outside of him doing a inciting radio

1134
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,960
show, which is what he does all the fucking time.

1135
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,480
In terms of what he actually did at the Capitol, there wasn't a lot of evidence of that on

1136
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,040
the show itself.

1137
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:45,360
But Alex does have video of himself and he is trying to talk the crowd down.

1138
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:51,360
If this video is to be believed as like a full representation of his actions, he seems

1139
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:56,660
very much like, hey everybody, we have a permit to be over there.

1140
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,400
Everybody go over there.

1141
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,480
And I think like, I mean, look, dude sucks, but that's probably the best you could do

1142
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,680
in that circumstance.

1143
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,680
Sure.

1144
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,680
And so he plays a little bit of that on the show.

1145
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:14,680
Listen to me, listen to me, we've got a permit on the other side, it's great that this happened,

1146
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,680
but the Trump's not going to come when we've taken this over.

1147
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,680
We're not ampersand, we're not BRO, you're amazing, I love you.

1148
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,680
Let's march around to the other side.

1149
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,680
Let's not fight the police and get the system to run.

1150
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,680
We are peaceful.

1151
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,680
We won this election.

1152
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:43,680
And as much as I love seeing the Trump flags flying over, if we need to not have the confrontation

1153
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,680
with the police, they're going to make that the story.

1154
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:52,680
I'm going to march to the other side where we have a stage where we can speak and occupy

1155
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,680
peacefully.

1156
00:47:53,680 --> 00:48:01,680
Tell everybody behind you, march to the other side, march to the other side.

1157
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,680
Alex has the instinct to know in the moment that like, if this gets too much further out

1158
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,680
of hand, we're fucked.

1159
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,680
Yeah.

1160
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:15,680
This is going to be something that is going, they will take the problem of right wing extremism

1161
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,680
far too seriously if this goes any farther.

1162
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,680
So I have to do my part to deescalate.

1163
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,680
Right.

1164
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,680
And it makes sense.

1165
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,680
It's in his character.

1166
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,680
It's exactly what you would do.

1167
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,680
No, it's the gate of gates all over again.

1168
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,680
She got out of pocket.

1169
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,680
Look, I don't get into that kind of deep source stuff.

1170
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,680
That's dangerous.

1171
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,680
Now, obviously I've incited that, said that, insisted that I do that.

1172
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,680
And because I'm so proud of doing that, I've almost certainly inspired other people to

1173
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,680
do that.

1174
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,680
But that's not my fault.

1175
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,680
No.

1176
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,680
This is his attempt to come back from the edge, as it were.

1177
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,680
He's gotten things this far and you want it to come back or else you're in trouble.

1178
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,680
This mob is all independent contractors.

1179
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,680
I don't, they don't work for info.

1180
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,680
So, like I said, I mean, the sense that I get is he just knows this is too much.

1181
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,680
This is dangerous.

1182
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:22,680
No, no, no, no.

1183
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:47,680
No, no, no, no, no.

1184
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:59,680
No, no, no.

1185
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,680
I mean, that's, that is pretty remarkable.

1186
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,680
This is the snapshot of what happens when exactly what you've been trying to get to

1187
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,680
happen happens.

1188
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,680
And you know that you never wanted that to happen.

1189
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,680
You wanted to live in that in-between state where you can profit off the tension.

1190
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,680
Yeah.

1191
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,680
This sex is supposed to be tantric.

1192
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,680
You're not supposed to come all over the Capitol building.

1193
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,680
Yeah, yeah.

1194
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,680
And what happens is you get on your radio show and you make a lot of money exciting

1195
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,680
people yelling, we're going to storm the state houses, you know, all this shit forever.

1196
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,680
Yeah.

1197
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,680
And then once you're there and it's happening, you get on a bullhorn and you yell, get off

1198
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,680
the building.

1199
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,680
Yeah.

1200
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,680
That's how it goes.

1201
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,680
Yeah.

1202
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,680
Yeah.

1203
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,680
We want to do this politically.

1204
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,680
No one knows what that means.

1205
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,680
You don't even know what that means.

1206
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:47,680
I swear to God, if I am a person who is in the middle of trying to storm a Capitol building

1207
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:53,680
and some asshole just starts screaming USA and I just like instinctively start chanting

1208
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,680
with, kill me, just kill me.

1209
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,680
I don't want to be that person.

1210
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:01,680
What if you're climbing on the Capitol building and then you hear the Texan get on the bullhorn

1211
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,680
and say, get off the building.

1212
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,680
You're getting off the building.

1213
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,680
I'm not getting off that building.

1214
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,680
I'm already up there.

1215
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,680
Yeah, probably not.

1216
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,680
You're on a bullhorn.

1217
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,680
You can't tear me down.

1218
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,680
I don't see it being an effective.

1219
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,680
I'm not going to pass that.

1220
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:16,280
But if I'm on my way to the building, maybe, and I just sit up to chant USA, I guess I

1221
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,360
think I might be a follower, Dan.

1222
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,280
I think I might not be the tip of the spear I thought I was.

1223
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,920
So Alex has a path to victory that he wants to explain to his audience, but he can't quite

1224
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,280
yet.

1225
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:33,680
You know, I need to do a presentation in here and I'm still working on getting the components

1226
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,680
I need.

1227
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,680
So I'm gonna go to rebroadcast for a while.

1228
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,680
It's no problem.

1229
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,040
And then once I get those components, I'm going to come in here and I'm gonna lay out

1230
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,240
the path to victory.

1231
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,680
So he doesn't end up...

1232
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,680
Maybe.

1233
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,000
I don't think he does do this.

1234
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,040
I didn't hear a path to victory other than blame Antifa.

1235
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,160
Well, Dan, the path to victory is a narrow path.

1236
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,160
Certainly.

1237
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,080
The very few can walk the path to heaven?

1238
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,080
Sure.

1239
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,080
Sure.

1240
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:03,920
During one of the breaks, it appears that Alex either did or is claiming to have talked

1241
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,160
to Mike Flynn, and he had some news about Trump.

1242
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:13,280
We are witnessing Satan's full attack, and I have been on the phone with the Flins.

1243
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,920
I have been on the phone with many others.

1244
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,920
You went home.

1245
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:25,000
Trump is basically in a shell, he is surrounded, and he is basically turning on his supporters

1246
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,640
and has been told that he will be 25th Amendment if he basically says or does anything now.

1247
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,240
So the president of the United States is captured.

1248
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,880
He was buffaloed, he was shanghaied, he was bamboozled.

1249
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,120
This is a good way to jettison Trump, the person from...

1250
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,040
You don't need him anymore, really.

1251
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,760
He has no real use.

1252
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,760
You've already seen him humiliated, basically.

1253
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:53,920
You've seen him turn tail whenever things got too close to what you want him to support.

1254
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,720
Which is so surprising, yeah.

1255
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:03,840
You've seen him bend to the whims of the people who are saying, like, you're going to lose

1256
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,520
this election because you lost.

1257
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,520
You're going to leave office.

1258
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,840
I'll leave office.

1259
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,960
Here's what's going to happen.

1260
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,560
He's not the strong man anymore.

1261
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:15,640
Next week, we are going to find out, and Dan, this is going to blow your mind.

1262
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,560
Did you know that Trump had mob ties?

1263
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,560
Whoa.

1264
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1265
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,560
We're going to find out.

1266
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:26,280
I guarantee you that Alex is going to suddenly discover this fact that he absolutely never

1267
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,280
knew before.

1268
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,280
Yeah, yeah.

1269
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,280
Yeah.

1270
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,280
Five years later.

1271
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,280
Wild.

1272
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,280
Wild how...

1273
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,520
Did you know that Trump was connected to a lot of mob people?

1274
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,980
I would even argue that that's maybe your way out.

1275
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:36,980
Did you know that he's...

1276
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,360
Say it was the mob who stopped the Patriots.

1277
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,280
Did you know that he was a front man for consortiums on the East Coast?

1278
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,280
I did not!

1279
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,280
Yeah.

1280
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:48,280
Did you know that with a name like Corleone, you get arrested, but with Trump, you don't?

1281
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:53,540
You know, it's almost like somebody who is already enthralled to medium powers would

1282
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:56,480
very easily be swayed by superpowers.

1283
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,480
Probably.

1284
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,480
Strange.

1285
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:05,000
So there were, like I said, some deaths at the rally, and, not rally, storming of the

1286
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Capitol.

1287
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,720
And there were a couple of medical-related ones, and there were also a couple of officers.

1288
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,440
There were a couple of cops.

1289
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,440
Right.

1290
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,000
So I assume since Antifa was there, those people went to the Antifa medical tents that

1291
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
were set up at every protest that...

1292
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,220
Well, they went to the free kitchen.

1293
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,220
The free...

1294
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,220
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1295
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,220
That's a great place.

1296
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,220
Yeah.

1297
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,220
No.

1298
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,400
Alex is gonna lie about these cops.

1299
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,860
You had a million people in D.C. conservatively that came there.

1300
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:39,280
You had hundreds of thousands, 300, 400,000 of the Capitol surrounding the whole thing.

1301
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,280
Never seen anything like it.

1302
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,560
And a couple of hundred went in, the police opened the gates, they were downsized that

1303
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:50,160
day, they were commanded to do it, and then four Patriots got killed, and one police officer

1304
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,740
had a stroke and died.

1305
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:55,040
So there were actually two cops at the Capitol who are now dead.

1306
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,560
One was Howard Liebengood, who passed away on Saturday, and at this point there's some

1307
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:02,200
reporting that's calling this an apparent suicide, which is very sad.

1308
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,780
The other is Brian Sicknick, who was assaulted by Trump rioters.

1309
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,320
Neither of these men died from a stroke.

1310
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,960
Alex is making that up to try and deflect from the human toll of his side's actions,

1311
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,320
which he can't acknowledge without kind of ruining this game that he's trying to play.

1312
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,320
Yeah.

1313
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,320
It's very sad.

1314
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,320
It's very sad.

1315
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:22,760
It's so obvious, this whole back of the blue nonsense, and we support the police, it's

1316
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,760
all cover.

1317
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,760
We just want to kill the left, can't you just let us kill them?

1318
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,400
Yeah, it's meaningless.

1319
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,840
We want to kill Nancy Pelosi, let us kill her!

1320
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:36,000
So there were only a few hundred people who went into the Capitol building, it's not that

1321
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
big a deal.

1322
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Sure.

1323
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Just a couple hundred.

1324
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Wait, what?

1325
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1326
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
It's just a couple hundred people.

1327
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
No!

1328
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
It's not a big deal.

1329
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
No!

1330
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,640
It's just a couple hundred.

1331
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,040
And who were the few hundred?

1332
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:55,520
Almost all of them were in bearskins and weird outfits, and Danny Crockett-type deals, and

1333
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,840
they had two shirts on saying, I am too, master!

1334
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,840
Guns.

1335
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,520
We got one of these guys coming on, I don't think he's a bad guy, I think he got stuck

1336
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,200
right into it, and I get the doors are open, he's a journalist, go cover it.

1337
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:11,640
But most of them weren't looting, some people joked around, I wouldn't go in their offices,

1338
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,880
I wouldn't dig through people's mail, that's a federal offense, I don't want my house broke

1339
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,440
into, or my office broken into.

1340
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,280
So there was criminal activity, but they've gone to Josh Hawley's house, they've gone

1341
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,720
to everybody's house, they've come to my house, they've come to Tucker Carlson's house, and

1342
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,720
they come and they threaten people and they engage in this.

1343
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:33,280
So ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to get prepared and ready, I don't know how long

1344
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,240
we'll even be here in this climate, we've got storeable food ready to ship right now

1345
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,880
at PrepareWithAlex.com, for the biggest, best company out there.

1346
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,880
Pretty smooth.

1347
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,880
Yeah.

1348
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:49,440
Nice, nice ad, nice ad transition.

1349
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,640
I think these people might be a little flustered.

1350
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:58,320
I think, you know what, I'm getting a feeling that the far right is trapped in this place

1351
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:04,520
where they're like, God, we want to kill everybody, and what happened, we want to do again.

1352
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,520
Yeah.

1353
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,960
But we can't do it again if we say we did it the first time.

1354
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,960
It was Antifa.

1355
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,120
It was Antifa.

1356
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,440
Next time's gonna be Antifa 2, by the way.

1357
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:17,960
But I also have to tell people to do it another time, while at the same time telling people

1358
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:22,680
not in advance that it will be Antifa who does the thing that they do again.

1359
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:28,520
And Trump will be president for a second term, even though he conceded, but you know, he

1360
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,760
didn't really, he had a metaphorical gun to his head, and if he did concede...

1361
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,920
We can put literal guns to everybody else's head.

1362
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:40,360
You should have heard the demonic cackling that came out of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

1363
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,360
Okay, okay.

1364
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,400
As soon as he said, I'm sorry, I'm conceding.

1365
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,240
You saw Harris, and then it looked totally freaked out and criminal, and you saw Biden

1366
00:57:49,240 --> 00:58:03,240
now at the podium just, Harris is like, Jesus, you were so mean to our BLM people, you abused

1367
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,040
them so badly in our Antifa.

1368
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,040
Yeah.

1369
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:11,480
Oh, we've seen what terrorists, we're gonna arrest all of you, finally, America's mine.

1370
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,600
It's like a little mermaid when she sells her soul or voice.

1371
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:19,800
And Melissa says, I got you, now you're a slave in the pen.

1372
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,200
Finally, under the pedophile king's control.

1373
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,040
Ursula was the villain in Little Mermaid.

1374
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:33,040
No, as we know, Alex prefers the bad guys in every movie.

1375
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,280
Maleficent was in Sleeping Beauty.

1376
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,280
Yes.

1377
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,280
And he's got him a little mixed up.

1378
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,280
That's an issue.

1379
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,280
Yeah.

1380
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,280
Yeah.

1381
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,800
Anyway, look, dude, there's only a couple hundred people under the Capitol.

1382
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,160
And also, look, dude, I-

1383
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,160
I am-

1384
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,160
Shush.

1385
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,160
... boggled.

1386
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,160
Shush.

1387
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,160
That's a beauty.

1388
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,160
That's a beauty.

1389
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,160
You think that's a beauty?

1390
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,160
It's a beaut.

1391
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,160
You think that?

1392
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,160
Ah, come on.

1393
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,160
It was a few hundred people in the Capitol building.

1394
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,320
If you think that's impressive, wait for this.

1395
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,840
They didn't even really wanna go in.

1396
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:05,760
The Capitol Police stood down, they were then ordered to let the crowds in that didn't even

1397
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:11,240
want in because I guess they needed to cover up the hundred Antifa and the other 50 or

1398
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,440
so orange hat guys that let in and did this.

1399
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,920
And it's them breaking the windows out doing it all.

1400
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:21,480
Yeah, man, the police were told to bring in these people who didn't even really wanna

1401
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:27,120
come in because they had to cover for Antifa and the orange hat people who are almost certainly

1402
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,520
Proud Boy related.

1403
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,520
Yeah.

1404
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,440
Dan, this is going to require a lot of- like there's gonna be- to find a solution and a

1405
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:39,680
way out of this problem, which is to say that the right wing is all terrorists.

1406
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:44,600
It's gonna require a lot of diplomacy, it's gonna require a lot of compromise and thought

1407
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,280
and some concession.

1408
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,040
That's gonna- that's just gonna be true.

1409
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:53,080
Now, on the other hand, I have watched a lot of superhero movies and they solve things

1410
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,080
by punching-

1411
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,080
Ninjutsu.

1412
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,080
Ninjutsu.

1413
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,200
I'm not saying one way is faster than the other.

1414
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,040
I'm just saying Ninjutsu.

1415
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,040
So we only had a couple hundred people in there, right?

1416
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,040
Whatever.

1417
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,040
I can't hear you say that without stopping.

1418
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,000
They didn't really even wanna go anywhere near the building.

1419
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,320
No, I can't hear you say that part.

1420
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,320
Right.

1421
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:16,920
But also there's, you know, like, look, they were probably hired gurus.

1422
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,000
I was there, our listeners saw it.

1423
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,040
Our listeners are like hardcore veterans and then retired cops and steel workers-

1424
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,160
Oh yeah, they were there too.

1425
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:30,520
We saw these skinny jean guys go attack the cops, they finally got the cops to fight back.

1426
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,520
Then these other guys came in as reinforcement.

1427
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,400
These weren't skinny jean guys, they hired some tough guys.

1428
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:40,360
So these skinny jean guys are the Antifa guys and they hired a group of goons who are much

1429
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,840
stronger than them because they're not strong.

1430
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:47,760
And so they hired stronger people as backup to fight against the police or something.

1431
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,280
It seems like this would be a job that almost nobody would take.

1432
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,560
In a certain sense, wouldn't that mean that anti-fascists were hiring fascists to do their

1433
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,760
dirty work for them?

1434
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,400
It would imply that.

1435
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,400
Okay.

1436
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,400
Alright.

1437
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:05,960
Because you would have to be like, if you are that group of, I don't know, bikers,

1438
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:06,960
let's say.

1439
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:07,960
Yeah, whatever you want.

1440
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,960
Pick anything.

1441
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,040
You would have to be willing to take a certain amount of money in order to almost certainly

1442
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,200
go on a death mission.

1443
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,200
Yes, that is correct.

1444
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,480
Because you would have to assume you're going to get killed for trying to-

1445
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:22,160
You're in the Capitol building of the United States of America, a nuclear power.

1446
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,160
Right.

1447
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,600
And you're just doing it as a job.

1448
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,600
Yeah.

1449
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1450
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,600
What?

1451
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,600
What, five grand?

1452
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,600
No, I don't even get five grand.

1453
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,600
I'll do it for 25.

1454
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,600
Okay.

1455
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,600
I'll take two.

1456
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,400
What kind of gone in 60 seconds kind of nonsense is this?

1457
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,400
It's the perfect crime.

1458
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:41,360
They have all of the family members of this biker gang kidnapped.

1459
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,360
I don't know.

1460
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:47,360
What I would just expect asking me to accept is a little bit too much.

1461
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,420
It's a little bit sad.

1462
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:51,080
Not for my family, Dan.

1463
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,640
They'll buy any old shit.

1464
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,000
So we do get one person who answered Alex's call.

1465
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,080
No Steve Pechenik, no Stuart Rhodes, no Roger Stone.

1466
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,080
Sure.

1467
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,560
Those people seem really important to this moment though.

1468
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,560
Oh, very.

1469
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,140
I want to hear CBP's take on this.

1470
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,760
Someone who's less important though, and maybe that's why he can appear, there's not a lot

1471
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,240
of heat on him, is Joel Skousen.

1472
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:16,720
He's somebody who can just come and go as he pleases.

1473
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,720
Yes.

1474
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:24,920
He's notably been somebody who's been harshly critical of Trump, which is why his power

1475
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,800
placement in Info Wars world has dropped a bit over the last few years.

1476
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,680
But now we might be seeing it elevate again.

1477
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:35,080
And he's anti-communist royalty based on his relation to W. Cleon Skousen.

1478
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:39,960
And so he shows up and of course everything's a fucking false flag to this guy.

1479
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:40,960
Sure.

1480
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1481
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:46,680
So of course Antifa did it and what have you, but he has proof.

1482
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:53,040
Well, Joel Skousen does, and he might've got this from another fellow we know named Lionel.

1483
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:57,040
Well the telltale case is every one of these people had backpacks and in those backpacks

1484
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:01,200
were gas masks, weapons, mace, or other smoke bombs or other things.

1485
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,480
Look, Trump supporters don't bring those types of things to a rally.

1486
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,480
They had backpacks.

1487
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,480
That's proof.

1488
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,000
Trump supporters don't have backpacks.

1489
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,960
And they don't bring that kind of stuff to rallies.

1490
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,160
That's exclusive to the left.

1491
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,160
This isn't fair.

1492
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,160
No.

1493
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,160
This isn't fair.

1494
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,160
No, it's very dumb.

1495
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,160
This isn't fun.

1496
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,160
I don't like it.

1497
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,160
They're mean.

1498
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,160
It's pretty dumb.

1499
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,520
But this next clip is absolutely mean.

1500
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,120
So Skousen is saying that like, look, there's going to be something really big happening.

1501
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,880
There's going to be a false flag coming that's really big.

1502
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,540
And Alex suggests, well, it's the Q stuff.

1503
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:38,920
The Q stuff is the false flag that's coming.

1504
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,960
Then Skousen throws Lin Wood under the bus.

1505
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,240
Hell yeah, throw Lin Wood under the bus.

1506
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,420
He's already under the bus.

1507
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:46,920
He's getting crunchy under that bus.

1508
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:51,640
Now I would suggest that the things that Skousen takes issue with are very similar to a lot

1509
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,040
of the things Alex says.

1510
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:56,720
How do you demonize a populist movement?

1511
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,720
That's their goal.

1512
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,720
They admit it.

1513
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,720
Yeah, that's right.

1514
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,620
You do it by these false flag attacks.

1515
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:05,240
And I'm just trying to portray that it's going to be more than a truck bomb.

1516
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,320
It's going to be more than Oklahoma-Siboney bombing.

1517
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,720
That's been done before.

1518
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:14,260
I think they're going to try to gin up some large mass revolutionary movements that in

1519
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:19,000
fact are going to be driven by agent provocateurs, not just anti-B.L.F.

1520
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,960
That's going to be whoever these feds are, these globalists in Q, because they're already

1521
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,880
saying Trump's secretly in Texas.

1522
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,980
He's about to order you to launch your military attacks.

1523
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:29,440
That is so damn obvious.

1524
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,440
That's right.

1525
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:35,440
And unfortunately, Lin Wood, Sidney Powell, they're listening to Q. Lin Wood published

1526
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:41,480
this rumor about the deep state is going to kill Donald Trump and all of his supporters.

1527
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,480
I mean, that's just bullshit.

1528
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,480
Stay there, Joe Skousen.

1529
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,480
Never heard Joe Skousen say BS.

1530
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,480
That's where we're at, folks.

1531
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,480
I'd give a little cut there.

1532
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,480
Yeah.

1533
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,080
Yeah, Lin Wood saying that the deep state is going to kill Trump and his supporters

1534
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,280
is such bullshit.

1535
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,280
Such bullshit.

1536
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:00,400
You're saying that to a guy who's said that a hundred times over the last couple months.

1537
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,240
And in waves, too.

1538
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,720
Not in like a, oh, I'm repeating the same story.

1539
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,120
No, no, no, no, sir.

1540
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:11,160
There are no reasons that the deep state will be killing Trump very shortly.

1541
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,800
And for quite a while, too, because-

1542
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,800
For a long time.

1543
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,200
You know, there have been Diet Coke poisonings.

1544
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,080
From before he was even inaugurated, they were like, oh, they're going to kill Trump

1545
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,080
on day one.

1546
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,080
They did everything.

1547
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,320
Alex said they were going to nuke the inauguration.

1548
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,320
Of course.

1549
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,320
Yeah.

1550
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,320
Did they do that?

1551
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,320
They're going to fly a helicopter into the podium.

1552
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,320
Oh, man.

1553
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,320
Jesus.

1554
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,320
Yeah.

1555
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:34,160
So, I mean, if Skousen wants to say that Lin Wood's doing his bullshit, then he should

1556
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,360
consider the bookings that he accepts.

1557
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,360
Yeah.

1558
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,400
Now, I won't take this away from Alex.

1559
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,400
Okay.

1560
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,440
Because there's a lot of, there's a lot of, you know, you got to give it up.

1561
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,080
When someone's right, they're right.

1562
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:49,560
Alex is a newsman at times, and he does sometimes come through with hard hitting scoops.

1563
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,560
All right.

1564
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,160
And I will say that this is something I've not heard reported anywhere else.

1565
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,160
Okay.

1566
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,160
That is giving me hope.

1567
01:05:55,160 --> 01:06:02,560
I can tell you, he's eating at one sitting, two steaks, five lobster tails, giant bowls

1568
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:07,240
of ice cream, and then eating prime rib as dessert and shoveling down piles of crab as

1569
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,240
dessert.

1570
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,080
And they're going, well, they say he's eating three times we normally eat.

1571
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:15,040
Well, he's not going to last very long health-wise that way.

1572
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,040
Hard attack!

1573
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,040
Hard attack!

1574
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,040
Hard attack!

1575
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,040
Alex is...

1576
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,040
Hard attack!

1577
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,680
Alex is reporting on Trump's outrageous appetite.

1578
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,680
That is...

1579
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,680
He's eating...

1580
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,680
That is...

1581
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:26,680
Piles of crab for dessert.

1582
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:31,880
No, no, he's, he's, I think Skousen is probably the person that I agree with most on this

1583
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:32,880
show.

1584
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:33,880
Wow.

1585
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,880
He's not going to last very long like that.

1586
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,880
Yeah.

1587
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:39,040
And I feel like that is a response too, because it's like, I know you're making that up, but

1588
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,280
I don't want to fight you about it, so I'll just say, well, that's not healthy.

1589
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,280
That's a bummer.

1590
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,280
Yeah.

1591
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,280
He really shouldn't do that.

1592
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,160
So Skousen, one of the things I've noticed that he does a lot is just make stuff up.

1593
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,160
Yeah.

1594
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:54,320
And what I worry about is, you know, over a hundred of those people have been arrested,

1595
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:58,600
but all the list of the 36 people they put in, the suspects that they're looking for,

1596
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,200
none of those were the agent provocateurs.

1597
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,640
If they did arrest some of those agent provocateurs, I think they'll be quietly released, because

1598
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:10,320
you know, the high officer will be told, you know, these are our boys, let them go.

1599
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,720
And that's what you never see because the press won't cover it, the police won't tell

1600
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,720
you.

1601
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:15,720
Patriots never wear masks.

1602
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,720
The whole thing is, all the guys doing this were wearing masks and backpacks.

1603
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,720
That's right.

1604
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:20,720
Oh, the backpacks.

1605
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:21,720
Okay.

1606
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:28,000
Just so everybody on the right knows, if you were arrested at DC and then let go, you are

1607
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Antifa.

1608
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Probably.

1609
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,880
So let's name them all by name.

1610
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:35,900
But also the problem with a theory like this, and the problem with the mentality like this

1611
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:41,240
is like, you'll never hear about it if this thing I'm imagining happens, then you never

1612
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,240
hear about it.

1613
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,880
Oh wow, that theory came true.

1614
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:45,880
That prediction.

1615
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:46,880
Yeah.

1616
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,800
Amazing how you managed to predict a thing that didn't happen.

1617
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:54,560
The fact that you never hear about it is proof of the reality of this conspiracy.

1618
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:58,080
So I would say that one of the big things, the big takeaways from this interview with

1619
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:05,320
Skousen is you get Alex pretty much agreeing with him that it's time to move on.

1620
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,280
Trump is useless now.

1621
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,920
He tried to do this little dictator push thing, and he's too weak.

1622
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,920
He gave it a go.

1623
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:13,920
Yeah.

1624
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:19,320
I think the Trump movement is really going to be looking for new leadership, and Donald

1625
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,320
Trump's going to be there.

1626
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,740
He's got an ego, I think, that when he recovers from this, I think he's going to try to lead

1627
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:24,740
the movement.

1628
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:25,740
I'll debate him.

1629
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:26,740
But I think we need to look to new leadership.

1630
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:27,740
I really do.

1631
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:28,740
I agree.

1632
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:31,560
And I don't want to be mean to Trump, but him being threatened with the 25th Amendment

1633
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:35,240
folding like this has wounded him severely.

1634
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:39,560
And I just think he's going to still be a force and try to act like he can fix the Republican

1635
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,560
Party.

1636
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,280
But again, he never had the intel to do it.

1637
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:44,820
His kids don't have it other than Don Jr.

1638
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:45,820
They just don't get it.

1639
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,320
They just don't have the intel.

1640
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,520
Well, that's right.

1641
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:55,480
Donald Trump's children, you know, and I worry about the Trump legacy, Don Jr. running or

1642
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,720
Ivanka or anything else.

1643
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,320
I think that's going to be bad for them.

1644
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,920
These people have no conservative background.

1645
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,240
They don't have the arguments.

1646
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,800
They're just going to play the movement.

1647
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:08,360
And they're less sincere, in my opinion, than Donald Trump is.

1648
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,360
I hate you so much.

1649
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,360
Yeah.

1650
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,360
I hate you so much.

1651
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,920
I think Ivanka and Eric, definitely.

1652
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,040
Deep and burning.

1653
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,040
And Don's trying.

1654
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,960
And I don't think, I don't think he's, it's not that Don's dumb.

1655
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,020
He's getting better.

1656
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:23,100
He just, it takes decades to learn this and he just doesn't have it.

1657
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,100
That's right.

1658
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,100
You've got to be in the movement.

1659
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:30,280
I've been in this thing for 50, 60 years and I have all my uncle's background and my father's

1660
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,280
background.

1661
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,600
I mean, it just takes a lot of energy to develop an instinct where you can smell evil, where

1662
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,400
you can smell the deep state and its presence.

1663
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,720
And that's what we need to teach people to develop.

1664
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:40,720
That's right.

1665
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,720
We're not bragging.

1666
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,720
We want to teach people this.

1667
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,720
We need to, exactly.

1668
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:46,960
We need to teach people how to make stuff up at every turn and call everything fake.

1669
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:53,520
I just know how it feels to be Don Jr. because I too was a shittier version of my dad and

1670
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,520
I was worse at it.

1671
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,520
My uncle.

1672
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,520
Oh, whatever.

1673
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,880
Um, but yeah, it's a, it's a, yeah, it takes years and years of, you know, just taking

1674
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,320
swings and, and being embarrassed about it to get over that.

1675
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,680
You gotta get rid of your embarrassment.

1676
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:09,160
You gotta be embarrassed for the first year and then you're free of it and you can say

1677
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,160
whatever you want.

1678
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,160
Yep.

1679
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,800
So, uh, it's like ninjutsu dude.

1680
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,800
Oh boy.

1681
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,800
Skousen is out.

1682
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,920
Um, and uh, now we get to what everyone has probably been waiting for and what I was the

1683
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,640
most interested in on this episode.

1684
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:28,840
Joining us is a man known as Q shaman.

1685
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:33,440
Jake the barbarian, I guess was his earlier incantation or incarnation.

1686
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,000
So he's got the Q shaman on.

1687
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,360
He is the guy who, uh, may, you know, all the pictures of the guy in the fur and like

1688
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,360
a helmet.

1689
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,000
He had the horn helmet.

1690
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Yep.

1691
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,280
Um, I don't, I don't know anything about this guy except for that he's the Q shaman and

1692
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,280
that's about all you need to know.

1693
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,280
Really.

1694
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:52,400
I found, I found out about him whenever somebody said that guy's the Q shaman and I was like,

1695
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,680
I know everything I need to know about this person.

1696
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,880
I heard his name was Q shaman.

1697
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,840
He chose that name and was fine with it and I've worked backwards and I know everything.

1698
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,840
Yeah.

1699
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,820
It's like, uh, if you find out that some guy is the Riverside strangler while he strangles

1700
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:07,040
people probably by the river.

1701
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,040
Yep.

1702
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,040
Yep.

1703
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,040
Yep.

1704
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,040
That makes sense about that.

1705
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,040
I know enough.

1706
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,040
Yep.

1707
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,040
Yep.

1708
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,040
And the Q shaman is a shaman of Q.

1709
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,040
Oh, it's the night stalker.

1710
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,040
Does he stalk at night?

1711
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,040
I believe he does.

1712
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:24,600
It's like, uh, Alex plays a clip of him from, uh, the day from, uh, outside the, uh, the

1713
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,040
Capitol building.

1714
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:31,520
And I don't think Alex pre-watch this because he's saying a lot of the same stuff that Alex

1715
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,360
says and this whole thing was a setup that Alex was going to try and embarrass him and

1716
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,200
try and be like a dick to him.

1717
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,200
Yeah.

1718
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,240
And unfortunately he sounds like Alex.

1719
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,240
Okay.

1720
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:46,960
We infiltrated, you can't move, but a hundred miles in any direction and you got a deep

1721
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,440
underground base.

1722
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,680
Okay.

1723
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,680
That's pretty much all true.

1724
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,680
The guy could have a talk show.

1725
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:55,720
He's very well spoken and boy does he know how to get attention in that outfit and, and

1726
01:11:55,720 --> 01:12:00,840
you know, I have some fun with a joker sometimes to get attention, but the Q thing is problematic

1727
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,920
and then he's in there in the middle of all this.

1728
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:06,100
I say, if you're a journalist, people go to the Capitol, go show what's happening.

1729
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:10,020
So Alex was ready to play that clip, come back from the other side and be like, can

1730
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,400
you believe this nonsense?

1731
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,200
But he's like, well, I can't argue with any of that.

1732
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:18,280
Well, I was talking to David Duke and it turns out we agree on a lot of stuff and it's a

1733
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:21,280
real weird situation that I didn't see this coming.

1734
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,280
Yeah.

1735
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,840
These are the kinds of things you would want producers to help you prepare for.

1736
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,600
Alex, Alex, Alex, you're crazy.

1737
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:33,640
Well, it turns out that the shaman, who I refuse to call anything but the shaman.

1738
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:34,680
Why would he have a name?

1739
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,000
His name's Jake something or other.

1740
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,120
Who gives a fuck?

1741
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,120
He got arrested.

1742
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,120
His name's Q shaman.

1743
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,840
He is now, he has now been arrested.

1744
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:41,840
Put it in all caps.

1745
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,160
I'm a sovereign citizen of Q shaman.

1746
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,880
So he's a listener of Alex's show.

1747
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,880
Of course he is.

1748
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:48,880
He actually really likes Alex.

1749
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:49,880
Of course.

1750
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,440
You can just call me Jake, Alex.

1751
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,440
It's an honor to speak with you, sir.

1752
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,440
Okay.

1753
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,320
Well, an honor, I mean, I'm sure you're a great guy.

1754
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:00,920
You don't go off like a bad guy, but I mean, if you, if you say you're a listener, have

1755
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:06,040
you heard me warn the stuff that Q is not invincible, that Trump's in a lot of trouble?

1756
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:11,320
You know, I have heard those warnings, but you know, I'm of the belief that Q is military

1757
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,280
intelligence and I have a lot of faith in the military and military intelligence.

1758
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,280
Okay.

1759
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:19,160
Well, I was, they couldn't stop you from storming the Capitol building.

1760
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,680
I literally talked to all the top people.

1761
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,680
Okay.

1762
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,680
And they're all surrounded and cut off.

1763
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:24,920
The tricoms are taken over.

1764
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,440
They tell me we're in desperate straits.

1765
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,440
Ooh.

1766
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:32,560
See, this is what I find really remarkable about this is that he is one of, I mean, I

1767
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:37,160
don't know, I don't know how much of there is like uniformity of belief, but a large

1768
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,480
part of the Q world does not like Alex.

1769
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,480
Yeah.

1770
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:44,960
There used to be someone who's fairly high profile in the Q world who also happens to

1771
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:50,200
like Alex and it's trying to have this conversation with Alex that he doesn't, I don't think he

1772
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,200
realizes it's a setup.

1773
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,720
He has no idea Alex is trying to be like, ha ha, you're so stupid.

1774
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,720
Yeah.

1775
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,720
Yeah.

1776
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:56,720
He has no idea.

1777
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:57,720
He's like, I believe the same thing as you do.

1778
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:03,440
He's trying to use the shaman as a prop in order to de-legitimize the QAnon stuff as

1779
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:07,080
part of the continuing, get people back from Q.

1780
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,080
Right.

1781
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:14,360
This is what Alex could have said immediately, okay, you believe that Q is military intelligence.

1782
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:17,560
Military intelligence absolutely must have known you were going to be at the Capitol

1783
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,320
building and did not stop you.

1784
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,320
Right.

1785
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,720
But the argument there is that they wanted them to.

1786
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,720
Right.

1787
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:23,720
Yeah.

1788
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:26,720
So Q betrayed you, Q shaman.

1789
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:27,840
No, not at all.

1790
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,720
Q shaman loves what happened on the sixth.

1791
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:34,960
Then it's not bad to fetus to tell America we're in trouble, need the general public

1792
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:35,960
to get involved.

1793
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:38,640
You understand that when the general public thinks everything's fine, they don't get

1794
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,640
involved.

1795
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:40,640
You understand?

1796
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,800
And so there can be a silent takeover because they don't know, then that's a problem.

1797
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:44,800
Does that make sense?

1798
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,800
Oh, absolutely.

1799
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:49,200
That's why I'm quite proud of what happened on January 6th.

1800
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,200
Okay.

1801
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,640
Tell us how you're proud of it.

1802
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:53,640
Tell us what happened.

1803
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:54,640
Oh God.

1804
01:14:54,640 --> 01:15:01,780
Well, first of all, we are talking about a government that was literally telling people

1805
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:07,240
when they can open their businesses, when they can see and hug their families, a government

1806
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:12,540
that is literally affecting the way or trying to affect the way that their citizens breathe.

1807
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:16,840
This is a problem for Alex because those are all arguments that he himself has made.

1808
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:17,840
Indeed.

1809
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:22,220
And now the Q shaman is coming in and explaining to Alex that this is tyranny and I'm proud

1810
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:26,340
that we stormed the Capitol because we should fight tyranny, which is also something Alex

1811
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,340
should believe.

1812
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:29,340
So he's Antifa.

1813
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:30,340
Alex is Antifa.

1814
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:31,340
I don't know.

1815
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:33,480
But we're all Antifa, Dan.

1816
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,280
We're deep state Tifa.

1817
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,620
Nothing is not real.

1818
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:38,920
Also everything is not real.

1819
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,740
This is really complicated for Alex.

1820
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:44,900
It's a position that I would, if I were him, I wouldn't have put myself in because I don't

1821
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:47,320
know if there's any way to look decent in this circumstance.

1822
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,320
No, it's not good.

1823
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,840
It's the same thing with like, don't interview Bill Ayers.

1824
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:51,840
You're not going to win that.

1825
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,840
You're not supposed to be there.

1826
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:53,840
No, it's a disaster.

1827
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,840
That's not for you.

1828
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:55,840
That's not for you.

1829
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:56,840
I know it sounds fun to yell at David Rothschild.

1830
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,840
Of course, you think it's going to be great.

1831
01:15:58,840 --> 01:15:59,840
It's a bad idea.

1832
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,840
You'll look dumb.

1833
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:01,840
You're kind of an idiot.

1834
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:02,840
Yeah.

1835
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:05,880
You're so dumb that the Q shaman looks decent next to you.

1836
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,680
And that's because he likes you.

1837
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:12,920
And because he, like, I mean, I'm totally against him and I think he, everything I know

1838
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,720
about him I don't support and I think he's wrong.

1839
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:18,920
All I know is that he's the Q shaman and I agree with you on all points.

1840
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:23,480
But there is a consistency to the beliefs.

1841
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:29,200
He believes the same things Alex does and isn't trying to just scam people.

1842
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,320
And that's the tension.

1843
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:37,360
I mean, it can't come off literally anymore like, hey, Alex, you said you wanted this.

1844
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,360
Yeah.

1845
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,360
I did it.

1846
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,360
Yeah.

1847
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,360
I'm proud of myself for doing it.

1848
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,360
What's going on with you, buddy?

1849
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,360
Yeah.

1850
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,360
Yeah.

1851
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,760
It's kind of a gut check for Alex and I don't know if he's enjoying it.

1852
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:50,400
So Alex is not into the idea of like storming the Capitol.

1853
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,400
Sure.

1854
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:57,040
He wants an abstract idea, like maybe a new declaration of independence and the shaman's

1855
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,040
not so into that.

1856
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:02,680
So to me, that sounds like treason on like the highest level.

1857
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:07,320
And if we have a right for a new declaration of independence, I just think it needs to

1858
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,240
be done if we can't fix things peacefully at the right time, right place.

1859
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:14,160
You can see how though Trump wants a 10 day investigation of fraud, we were about to get

1860
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:15,160
it.

1861
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,800
How storming the Capitol screwed all that up.

1862
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:22,640
Well, I don't quite see it that way, Alex, to be perfectly honest with you.

1863
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:28,900
I think that if anything, we sent a very clear message to the globalist and to the communist.

1864
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,600
You sent a message.

1865
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,440
There's no clarity of that message.

1866
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,440
Yeah.

1867
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,440
Not there.

1868
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:40,320
I mean, there's some elements of it that are clear.

1869
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,320
That one's clear.

1870
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,320
Yeah.

1871
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,320
Yeah.

1872
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,320
What was the other one?

1873
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,200
I mean, I'm scared, I guess that's clear.

1874
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,200
That's fair.

1875
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:53,680
Yeah, I think that the shaman believes that they're up against a treasonous government

1876
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:58,840
and they sent a very strong message with their actions and Alex can play this game where

1877
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:03,480
he thinks that there's going to be a new declaration of independence, but shaman doesn't not into

1878
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,480
that.

1879
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,920
And he also doesn't agree with the idea that like, oh, we were going to get the 10 days

1880
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:14,520
that Rudy Giuliani wanted and you all fucked that up by storming the Capitol.

1881
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:20,220
And so Alex is trying to get the shaman to accept that the deep state who he's supposed

1882
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:23,760
to be against, they actually wanted him to do this.

1883
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,760
Here we go.

1884
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:27,040
You know Antifa helped break down stuff and wanted this to happen.

1885
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,240
I mean, you know, the deep state liked what happens, right?

1886
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,880
Cause I mean, I know you think it showed them who's boss and all the rest of it, but I don't

1887
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:38,160
think you get my perspective that Trump's now capitulating and all this, I mean, this

1888
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,160
is not good.

1889
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,160
Well, everybody has their opinion, Alex.

1890
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:45,000
And in all honesty, I understand where you're coming from.

1891
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,960
I just don't quite fully agree with you.

1892
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:51,280
Do you think Trump's in a secret location in Texas and everything, and it's a CG of

1893
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,280
him capitulating?

1894
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:59,780
You know, in all honesty, I believe in Occam's razor, Alex, and I only talk about things

1895
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:03,640
that I know for certain I can prove or things that I know beyond a shadow of a doubt are

1896
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:04,640
real.

1897
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,640
Okay.

1898
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,640
Yeah.

1899
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,520
I take issue with that, but it's not worth getting bogged down.

1900
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,520
Yeah.

1901
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,520
I'm just going to scream.

1902
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,520
He's the Q shaman.

1903
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,720
I, you know, it's weird.

1904
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,680
I can almost respect it.

1905
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:20,240
Like if you do that shit, because what you believe in is that there's a treasonous government

1906
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,680
and you're like, fuck it.

1907
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,360
I can't handle this anymore.

1908
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,960
I'm going to go overthrow the goddamn country.

1909
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,320
And then you stick with it afterwards and you say, I believed that what I was doing

1910
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,320
was right.

1911
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,200
I believed that it's necessary.

1912
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:38,000
And sure, all of your beliefs are based on bullshit, but at least you believe shit.

1913
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,200
It's indicative, it's indicative of somebody who actually isn't like just playing games

1914
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,480
or somebody who cares a little scarier.

1915
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,480
It's terrifying.

1916
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,820
And at the same time, I can't get around the fact that he's the Q shaman.

1917
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:50,820
There's that.

1918
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:53,760
And you wouldn't be doing that kind of stuff unless you were trying to brand, unless you

1919
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,600
were trying to like sell Q shaman shirts or something like that.

1920
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,320
Every revolution has color for characters.

1921
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,320
Yeah.

1922
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:04,040
But there's, I mean, there's gotta be a grift in here somewhere, but it's far different.

1923
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:07,840
Just like stancing like that could be, could be dislikes the outfit.

1924
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,920
But I'm just saying, I would, I respect him infinitely more.

1925
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,960
Well, we have to parse respect.

1926
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,080
Oh, well, well respect, I suppose respect is a form of fear.

1927
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:20,800
I'm more afraid of his bullshit because he's a believer.

1928
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,800
Yeah.

1929
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:26,040
I wanted to make sure people didn't hear you saying respect and be like thinking you applaud

1930
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,040
or anything.

1931
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:31,720
It's a, yeah, there, there's a, like at least, at least there's a consistency and I don't

1932
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:35,700
think Alex was ready for that because I think that he doesn't, he's not used to be people

1933
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:36,700
who care.

1934
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:40,400
And I don't think, I think that he thought that this shaman was going to be some idiot

1935
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:46,320
that he was going to be able to steamroll and he's disagreeing on multiple accounts

1936
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:51,460
with Alex in a way that is not confrontational, but it's just like, oh, I think we don't see

1937
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:53,040
eye to eye on that.

1938
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,200
And Alex doesn't like that.

1939
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,280
There's something about underestimating your opponent.

1940
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,180
I heard that you're supposed to do that.

1941
01:20:58,180 --> 01:20:59,880
Is that what you're supposed to do?

1942
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:00,880
Underestimate all the time.

1943
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:01,880
It's always helpful.

1944
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:02,880
Okay.

1945
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,720
So I think that one of the things that I've always felt about QAnon and Alex and their

1946
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:11,400
relationship with each other is part of Alex's feelings about it are, it's just petty jealousy.

1947
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:15,880
And like he's furious that everybody is talking about so many of the same things that he always

1948
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:19,960
had conspiracies about, but they all think that Q uncovered it.

1949
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:20,960
It's for me.

1950
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:21,960
I did it.

1951
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:22,960
Yeah.

1952
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:23,960
I think he's a little jealous.

1953
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:27,040
And look, Jake, the barbarian, you're a very well spoken guy.

1954
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,440
Let's think about the Q thing.

1955
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,720
You're talking about the federal reserve, the new world order, secret technologies.

1956
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,720
All this is real.

1957
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:36,280
But then it's like, oh, Q, Q is why we know about it.

1958
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:40,240
I know we know about it because of Cleon Skousen, we know about it because of Ron Paul, we know

1959
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:44,440
about it because of Carole Quigley being a criminal and admitting it all, we know about

1960
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,440
it because of Matt Brackett.

1961
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,680
It's not about the credit.

1962
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:47,800
We're all public people.

1963
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:48,960
Sounds like it's about the credit.

1964
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:49,960
Yeah.

1965
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:53,160
It feels like the intensity of it really feels like it has something to do with the credit.

1966
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,600
It feels a little bit like that.

1967
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:55,600
Yeah.

1968
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,960
I don't think that if, let's imagine this is some sort of a fantasy world and QAnon

1969
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:03,000
did manage to overthrow the world government.

1970
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,280
I don't think Alex would take that as a victory.

1971
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,280
Yeah.

1972
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:07,280
Yeah.

1973
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,280
Yeah.

1974
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:13,360
If everybody was throwing parties for Q shaman for successfully overthrowing the new world

1975
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,520
order and everyone's like, Alex who?

1976
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:22,420
But isn't that such like, oh, I want to live in a fascist nightmare so long as I'm on top.

1977
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:25,680
I don't want to live in a fascist nightmare where Q is running things and I have to listen

1978
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,680
to that asshole.

1979
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,680
Yeah.

1980
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:31,960
Yeah, Alex doesn't want his right wing fantasy world if it comes with Q.

1981
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:32,960
Exactly.

1982
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:33,960
Yeah.

1983
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:34,960
Absolutely.

1984
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,720
So this is the point where things I think really turn in the interview and this is where

1985
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,000
it gets condescending.

1986
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,040
Alex starts being a real dick to Q shaman and it's tough for me to stand up for Q shaman

1987
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,040
because I don't care.

1988
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,040
No, I'm fine with that.

1989
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,040
Be a dick to him.

1990
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:53,080
But like just from the standpoint of politeness, this is very impolite.

1991
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,320
Go ahead Q shaman.

1992
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,520
Tell me what's coming next then.

1993
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,680
I want to believe it.

1994
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:58,680
Where is Trump?

1995
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:01,960
Do you think this is a devastating victory you just had at the Capitol?

1996
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:05,440
Explain to me and bring me up to the level of a Q shaman.

1997
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:10,560
Well, first of all, allow me to say that I am not Antifa.

1998
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,720
I am not BLM.

1999
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:16,920
I know that there's rumors floating around online, probably disinformation agents spreading

2000
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:17,920
disinformation.

2001
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,200
So start with that.

2002
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:23,480
I'm a Q supporter, a QAnon, digital soldier of sorts.

2003
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:24,480
Yeah.

2004
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,400
He's not Antifa.

2005
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:30,280
And I don't think Alex is necessarily saying that he is.

2006
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:34,480
I think that he's saying he's fooled by the Antifa provocateurs, but you can hear that

2007
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,480
tone.

2008
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,480
You're a shaman.

2009
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,040
Why don't you tell me about what's going on?

2010
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:42,300
I feel like I would say it in the very similar tone though.

2011
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:43,960
But I don't think you would have the interview.

2012
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,040
Oh no, of course not.

2013
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:49,120
I don't think having this interview is a productive thing to do.

2014
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:55,360
No, if we were in a bar and I was chained to one of the chairs and had no choice but

2015
01:23:55,360 --> 01:24:00,160
to stay there, Q shaman sat down next to me and he started a conversation.

2016
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:04,000
Eventually I would get to the point where I'm like, all right, Q shaman, you tell me

2017
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,760
what the fuck Q is up to.

2018
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,760
Yeah, maybe.

2019
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,880
But Alex invited him on the show.

2020
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:09,880
That's a little bit different.

2021
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,600
I wouldn't invite Q into my home to then yell at him.

2022
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,880
No, but Alex does because he wants to mock the dude.

2023
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:16,880
What are you?

2024
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:22,640
Are you a Norseman or are you a Q shaman?

2025
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,640
What are you?

2026
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,520
I am a shamanic practitioner.

2027
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:26,520
Okay.

2028
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,400
I'm a spiritual warrior.

2029
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,580
And if you really want to know what's really going on, what is really going on is we are

2030
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:33,840
changing the quantum realm, sir.

2031
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,440
This is spiritual warfare.

2032
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:40,280
And we understand that DC is built on ley lines, electromagnetic ley lines.

2033
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:46,320
And we understand that yes, the Satanists, the Luciferians, the globalists, the nihilists,

2034
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:50,560
the Nazis, these people that have infiltrated our government are practicing black magic.

2035
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:54,920
They are doing evil, sick, satanic ceremonies and rituals where they're sacrificing children

2036
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,600
and drinking blood and all that stuff.

2037
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:00,080
And the hub of it is in DC and London and in the Vatican.

2038
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:05,520
If we understand that these things are like acting like a beacon for this low frequency

2039
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,520
demonic energy.

2040
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:07,520
Oh shit.

2041
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,520
Okay, brother.

2042
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,520
Yeah.

2043
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,520
Yeah.

2044
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:11,520
I know the globalists are in the word stuff.

2045
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,520
I'm trying to explain to you.

2046
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:16,040
Q told us that Trump was invincible and Hillary was in a prison, right?

2047
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,040
Yes.

2048
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,600
I'm saying is that Trump was going to be there in 12 days then?

2049
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,440
I'm answering your question, interrupting.

2050
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,440
So here's the thing.

2051
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:23,440
Oh shit.

2052
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:29,320
Q shaman for whatever, I mean, I guess you probably guessed this based on the fact that

2053
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,040
he stormed the Capitol building.

2054
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,320
He has a pretty healthy sense of self.

2055
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,680
Does not give a fuck.

2056
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:37,620
Pretty intact ego.

2057
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:39,120
That is well done.

2058
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:44,800
Alex, I don't know if you know this or not, but I stormed the Capitol building wearing

2059
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,740
assless chaps and a helmet.

2060
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:51,200
Are you going to interrupt me like I give a fuck about you?

2061
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,640
Your diversionary questions are not important to me.

2062
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:56,560
I'm going to answer the question that was asked.

2063
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,040
So he's a shaman and you know, whatever.

2064
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:05,580
I don't begrudge people for, or I don't even look down on the idea of spiritualism or whatever

2065
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:07,700
practice you want to have.

2066
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:13,280
That would not be the angle I would take to make fun of this.

2067
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:20,300
But he does, he does think that they prayed in the Senate and they did some magic.

2068
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:24,280
So here's the thing, because the Washington DC is built on ley lines, right?

2069
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:26,840
It's built on the electromagnetic ley lines of the earth.

2070
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:32,840
When we ended up going to DC, when we were shouting USA, when we're shouting freedom,

2071
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:37,120
when we're shouting four more years, we are literally affecting the quantum realm.

2072
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:41,920
We're like pygmies dancing around a fire or, or, or Navajo doing a ghost dance.

2073
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:47,040
It's going to make the white man go away because sound supersedes electromagnetic activity.

2074
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,040
Okay.

2075
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:57,000
Now by marching into the Capitol, by the quantum realm in that way, we actually took back the

2076
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Capitol building for God.

2077
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,280
I said a prayer inside the Senate.

2078
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:08,720
I sang my shamanic song inside the Senate and I broke up all that negative shit.

2079
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:12,080
It was your shamanic song right now on the air.

2080
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,080
Do you want to talk?

2081
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,080
Cause I'll just let you talk.

2082
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2083
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,080
You're telling my God, I'm learning.

2084
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,080
Occam's razor is a shamanic.

2085
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:21,080
Then do me a favor and let me get finished, my brother.

2086
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:22,080
I'm going to let you finish.

2087
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,080
Let's get back in church.

2088
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:25,200
Well, we're now learning the secret of Q power.

2089
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,200
He is a Q priest.

2090
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,200
It is a religion.

2091
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,200
Everything's fine.

2092
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,200
I don't know about all that.

2093
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,840
I think that he can tell that Alex is being a dick to him.

2094
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:33,840
Yeah.

2095
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:34,840
Yeah.

2096
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:37,240
See now if we're in a bar, I'm still chained to my chair and he's coming back at me with

2097
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,240
that.

2098
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,240
He's like, hi buddy.

2099
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,240
Now we can talk.

2100
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:45,880
There's some humanity there more than like Alex is going to let me finish my book.

2101
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:49,720
So at this point, Alex goes the only route that he really knows how to do and that is

2102
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:54,980
he's just going to decide to make fun of shamanism as a way to attack this guy.

2103
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:57,720
Don't engage with the things that I agree with.

2104
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:58,720
Yes.

2105
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,760
Listen dude, shamanism is the oldest religion in the world.

2106
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:07,520
They use singing, drumming, dancing, and they use elaborate dress, you know, the head dress,

2107
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:16,440
the face to change the quantum realm through sound, through electromagnetic activity.

2108
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:20,080
And he has a question for you and he's coming up after I leave.

2109
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,220
If you want to talk to him, hold on.

2110
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:24,000
I understand magical powers.

2111
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,120
No, it's not about magic, dude.

2112
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,800
We're talking about physics here, Alex.

2113
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:28,800
We're talking about physics.

2114
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,800
Okay.

2115
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:35,120
You are a shamanic lizard.

2116
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,280
We get that.

2117
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:39,680
It's just, it's sad.

2118
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:43,240
It's not a productive conversation for anybody, but it's because of Alex.

2119
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,240
Yeah.

2120
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:48,400
I mean, it wouldn't be a productive conversation if the Q shaman was talking to anybody because

2121
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:52,720
you'd be talking about ley lines and magical- No, it's not magic, Dan.

2122
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:53,720
I'm sorry, it's physics.

2123
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:54,720
It's quantum physics.

2124
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:55,720
Sorry.

2125
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:56,720
It's quantum entanglement.

2126
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:57,720
Sorry.

2127
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:58,720
You know what that means.

2128
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:04,200
That means whenever an electron from a single atom is paired together with another electron,

2129
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:08,240
then for some reason, it doesn't matter how far apart they are, ley lines.

2130
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:09,240
Right.

2131
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,240
I misspoke.

2132
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:14,440
My point is that it wouldn't be a productive conversation with him and Cronkite.

2133
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,440
No.

2134
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,440
No.

2135
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:17,440
Or a rock.

2136
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:22,840
But Alex brought him in for the explicit purpose of trying to impugn Q.

2137
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:23,840
Yeah.

2138
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:28,920
And now that isn't working and Alex can't really do anything, which you'd think he would

2139
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:29,920
be able to.

2140
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:30,920
Like he knows who Q is.

2141
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:31,920
Yeah.

2142
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,640
He should be like, I know these people.

2143
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:36,520
Do you not understand?

2144
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:39,960
Based on the things that he said, he should be able to completely deconstruct this easily,

2145
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:40,960
but he can't.

2146
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,040
And so the only thing he can do is make fun of this guy's spirituality.

2147
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,040
And that sucks.

2148
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,040
That's childish.

2149
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:50,640
It does seem like the easiest way for Alex to go would be like, excuse me, Q shaman.

2150
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,240
You listen to my show, right?

2151
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:55,480
I told you two months ago that I knew who Q was.

2152
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:57,600
I threatened to unveil it and then I didn't.

2153
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:58,600
Yeah.

2154
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,640
So I'm just going to tell you who Q is right now.

2155
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,680
And it's not military intelligence.

2156
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,480
It's Dickface McGee over here.

2157
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:05,480
Yeah.

2158
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:06,480
And that would be the end of it.

2159
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:10,040
I mean, obviously he would be like, that's not true, but then it would just be over.

2160
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:13,800
You know, you wouldn't have to deal with any more of this whiny shaman bullshit.

2161
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:17,560
Well, there doesn't need to be any conversation of like, what do you believe?

2162
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:18,560
What do I believe?

2163
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:19,560
I know them.

2164
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:20,560
They're here.

2165
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:21,560
Exactly.

2166
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:27,080
Based on what Alex has pretended to be aware of and to know as fact, he shouldn't be having

2167
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:30,760
any kind of, I believe you believe conversation about this.

2168
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:31,760
Totally.

2169
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,720
It's something that should be a settled issue for him, frankly.

2170
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:34,720
Yeah.

2171
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:35,720
Yeah.

2172
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:36,720
Yeah.

2173
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:37,720
But it doesn't seem to be.

2174
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:38,720
That's strange.

2175
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:42,440
And it's really unfortunate to listen to because like the Q shaman is just saying stuff that

2176
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:43,440
Alex agrees with.

2177
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,920
And so he has to keep interrupting him.

2178
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:50,960
I'm asking you with your wizard powers, why you were able to know that the Q was the answer.

2179
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:51,960
Tell me.

2180
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:52,960
Okay.

2181
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,920
Q is the highest levels of the military and the intelligence community disseminating above

2182
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,160
top secret information to Patriots in our Republic.

2183
01:30:58,160 --> 01:30:59,160
This is full disclosure.

2184
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,640
So we can take back our country from the communists and the globalists who are attempting this

2185
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:06,240
in prison, so they can bring it down.

2186
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:10,840
Why does he leave Julian Assange in prison when he's the real Q type person?

2187
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,240
You keep interrupting the hours.

2188
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,240
I love you, dude.

2189
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:17,320
I love you, but you gotta let me talk about the highest level of military intelligence.

2190
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:18,320
Tell me more about it.

2191
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,320
Are you waiting for your turn to speak, sir?

2192
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,320
Are you listening?

2193
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:23,000
Tell me about the highest level of military intelligence.

2194
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Okay.

2195
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Well, I mean, Alex had Zach, his fake insider dude who was supposedly the other Q or whatever.

2196
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,060
Alex has done all this shit.

2197
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:40,320
All the themes behind what Shaman is saying here are the things that Alex talks about

2198
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,320
all the time.

2199
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:42,320
Totally.

2200
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:46,000
Communists and globalists have infiltrated the government, and this is an exposure of

2201
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
that.

2202
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
It's all exactly the same.

2203
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,140
And Alex can't, he can't attack the meat of it without hurting himself.

2204
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:57,840
And so he tries to distract with questions about Julian Assange, and then...

2205
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:00,760
I mean, I would interrupt that spiel too, though.

2206
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:01,760
That was...

2207
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:05,480
I'm interrupting anybody who's trying to sell me a timeshare, and if you have rehearsed

2208
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:10,280
your little bit like that, yeah, you know what you're doing.

2209
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:15,840
If you invite someone onto your show to sell you a timeshare so you can interrupt them

2210
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:20,080
to score points about how annoying it is when people try to sell you timeshares, that's

2211
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,120
kind of a dick move.

2212
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:25,440
Yeah, isn't that Sacha Baron Cohen's job?

2213
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,440
Wow.

2214
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:29,080
There's more layers to it than that, but yeah.

2215
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:35,040
So I just see the way that he's describing, the Shaman is describing his beliefs, it's

2216
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:38,840
just basically a lot of the same stuff that Alex believes, but with a couple of different

2217
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:39,840
characters.

2218
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,440
Like there's just a different cast.

2219
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,440
Slightly different.

2220
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:47,800
So Q is military intelligence disseminating above top secret information to patriots in

2221
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:52,120
our republic so we can take back our country from communists and globalists who have infiltrated

2222
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:55,760
our government at some of the highest levels so that they could bring America down from

2223
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:56,760
within.

2224
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:58,760
This is infiltration instead of engagement.

2225
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:03,640
They're doing this so they can create a new world order, and they try to get rid of our

2226
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:04,640
constitution based on their national law.

2227
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:10,600
I know about the new world order, Q tells us the almighty Q Lord, and you are his priest,

2228
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:11,600
tells us everything's fine.

2229
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,600
So does the...

2230
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,600
I'm not saying everything's fine, you're interrupting me.

2231
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,600
Put it in my mouth.

2232
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,600
I can't handle this guy.

2233
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:20,200
I don't know if he's for real or whether he is hiring a kite, Matt Bracken, but this is

2234
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:21,520
crazy talk.

2235
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,600
It's crazy talk?

2236
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:25,040
It doesn't sound any different than most of the stuff I hear on Infowars.

2237
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,040
Not at all different.

2238
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,040
No.

2239
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,600
In no way different other than he's saying Q before.

2240
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:30,600
Yep.

2241
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:31,600
That's it.

2242
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:32,600
That's it.

2243
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:33,600
100% the same thing.

2244
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:34,600
Yep.

2245
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,600
Wow.

2246
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,280
So Alex decides that the Shaman, this guy's an asshole.

2247
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:39,280
I hear you.

2248
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,280
Matt Bracken, stay there.

2249
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,280
I'm gonna do five more minutes with you and the guests, and I'm not trying to be mean

2250
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:43,280
to the guests.

2251
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,600
If Ellen wants to have him on, he's welcome to have him, or if he can have the guy back,

2252
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,600
we'll let him talk.

2253
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,200
Cause it's very entertaining.

2254
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:53,600
It's just that it's like, I tell this guy like, Hey, I'm dialed into all that stuff.

2255
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:54,600
Okay.

2256
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,600
And they don't know what's going on.

2257
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,600
Nobody does.

2258
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:58,600
He's just like, how is all the military intelligence?

2259
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,960
How is all the military intelligence?

2260
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:05,320
I mean, they don't even, it isn't even like I tell people like real stuff like this is

2261
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:06,320
going to happen.

2262
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:09,680
Oh, Trump next week, we'll have a thing on the ellipse that was out for five days.

2263
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:10,680
It's all real.

2264
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:15,560
Who cares if you talk to Trump, we talked to the highest levels of military intelligence.

2265
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:16,560
You know?

2266
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:21,280
And, and, and so it's just so frustrating to sit there and watch our people wake up,

2267
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,800
but then believe the Charlton garbage.

2268
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:29,400
This again, just seems like petty jealousy and like, why am I not Q?

2269
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,360
Why am I not as important as Q?

2270
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:35,440
It's so frustrating to see them buy those t-shirts with Q on it.

2271
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:38,600
When they could be buying Infowars branded pills.

2272
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,600
And they could be buying.

2273
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,600
It's disgusting to see people wake up wearing a shirt with Q on it instead of taking two

2274
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,600
of these pills.

2275
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:48,840
They could buy my duct tape that I bought, the stickers that I told them to put over

2276
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:50,120
your mouth that say, I am Q.

2277
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:51,120
Yep.

2278
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,120
Yep.

2279
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:53,120
Totally.

2280
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:54,120
Totally.

2281
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:55,120
What are you doing wearing a shirt?

2282
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,120
This goes over your mouth.

2283
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:57,120
It's a shirt for your mouth.

2284
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:58,120
Yeah.

2285
01:34:58,120 --> 01:34:59,120
So Alex has now turned the corner.

2286
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,640
I really don't think that he likes this guy at all.

2287
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:06,720
It's unfortunate because the guy has been very nice to Alex so far, but Owen wants

2288
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:07,720
to clear up one thing.

2289
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:11,320
Cause he's, he's now in studio cause he's going to be taking over the fourth hour.

2290
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:16,680
Matt Bracken is also there hanging out just for moral support, I guess.

2291
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:21,040
Owen wants to know like, Hey man, people found an acting profile about you.

2292
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,640
Are you an actor?

2293
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:25,760
I just want to address, you obviously said you're not antifa.

2294
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:26,760
I don't think you're antifa.

2295
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:29,120
The other thing people want to know about you is are you an actor?

2296
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:31,480
They found a profile that says you went to an acting school.

2297
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:34,760
So they think you're acting and this whole thing is just an act.

2298
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:36,440
So would you like to address that?

2299
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,440
Abso-freaking-lutely.

2300
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:38,440
Okay.

2301
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:42,720
So the whole reason why I have an acting profile is because I worked with children for five

2302
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:45,600
and a half years in group homes, traumatized children.

2303
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:49,360
And I got chased out of the home with a knife by one of the kids that pulled it out of a

2304
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,880
locked cabinet.

2305
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:54,100
And I decided that I wanted to do something a little bit more fun.

2306
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:56,000
So I went into business for myself.

2307
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,840
I developed my own website, my own YouTube.

2308
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:02,120
I started writing books and I thought about, well, maybe I'll give acting a shot to earn

2309
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:03,400
a little bit of money on the side.

2310
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:05,240
I haven't made any money as an actor.

2311
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:06,240
I never got anywhere.

2312
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:07,240
You're not an actor.

2313
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:08,240
We got that.

2314
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:11,800
And they say I say I'm an actor because I've been in a few movies, it's a total bull.

2315
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:12,800
Right.

2316
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,200
He was almost in Guardians of the Galaxy.

2317
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,200
True.

2318
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:16,200
He was going to be Star-Lord.

2319
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,200
He was going to be Star-Lord.

2320
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:18,200
So close.

2321
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,200
He's so close.

2322
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,200
He just wouldn't worship the devils and he wouldn't let them do it.

2323
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:23,280
He wouldn't take too much money for it.

2324
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,280
Yeah.

2325
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:30,240
So, hard-hitting questions there to dispel internet conspiracies that won't go away because

2326
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:32,920
this guy said he's not an actor on Alex Jones' show.

2327
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:33,920
No, no, no.

2328
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:34,920
Completely a waste of time.

2329
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:35,920
No, no, no.

2330
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:42,280
Alex and Infowars' followers are well known for, if somebody says they're not an actor,

2331
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:43,280
believing them.

2332
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:50,080
So Alex is taking the approach that he's sort of trying to shame and belittle the Q shaman.

2333
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:56,640
And I would argue that somebody who makes their business going around to protests dressed

2334
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:00,360
that ridiculously for the sake of getting attention, you're not going to be able to

2335
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:01,360
shame them.

2336
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,360
You can't embarrass them.

2337
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:03,600
I would be surprised if you could.

2338
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,600
Yeah.

2339
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:05,600
It doesn't work.

2340
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,000
Listen, you're a Q wizard, okay?

2341
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,600
I'm asking you, does Trump end in 12 days?

2342
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,600
Does Trump what?

2343
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,160
What happens to Trump?

2344
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,160
Q knows everything.

2345
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:16,160
You know military intelligence.

2346
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:17,160
What happens to Trump?

2347
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:19,160
Well, you know what, man?

2348
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:26,040
All I can say is I think that Donald Trump is a part of a much larger plan, whether that

2349
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:29,360
be a military plan, whether that be God's plan.

2350
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:34,440
I think that when you look at harmonics, when you look into the way that energy, frequency

2351
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:42,120
and vibration basically create and move all physical form, all matter, then we're all

2352
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:47,360
playing a part in a much larger, grander scheme, a much larger, I'm not saying there's no harmonics

2353
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:48,360
and greater schemes.

2354
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:51,360
And then terrible stuff.

2355
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,360
I know all that.

2356
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:53,360
But I'm saying, hold on, hold on.

2357
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:54,360
I'll let you talk.

2358
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:55,360
But I got to say this.

2359
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:59,880
I got to say this, but Q told us Trump was invincible and everybody was going to get

2360
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:06,920
hit, though, so I'm saying Q leads us once Trump's gone still is what you're saying.

2361
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:12,040
What I'm saying, and this is you putting words in my mouth again, Alex, what I'm saying is

2362
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:18,280
that Donald Trump is a part of a much larger plan to help us take back our country from

2363
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:19,280
globalists and communists.

2364
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:22,480
He's the baby toe of military intelligence, aren't you?

2365
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,120
But Alex has said that, too.

2366
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:25,120
Yeah.

2367
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:26,120
A bunch.

2368
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:30,880
And of course, this leads to its natural conclusion, which is Alex is going to blow up and yell

2369
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:31,880
at this guy.

2370
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:32,880
Have a little hissy fit.

2371
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:33,880
Yes.

2372
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:34,880
Yeah.

2373
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:41,920
And I just don't know what actual difference there is between their beliefs.

2374
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:50,240
Donald Trump has played a very pivotal role in exposing the globalists and the cabal,

2375
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:54,320
exposing the Chinese and the communists and the way that they've infiltrated our government,

2376
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:58,160
the way they've infiltrated our media, the way they've infiltrated our entertainment,

2377
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:59,720
the way they've infiltrated all that.

2378
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:00,720
We broke all that.

2379
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:01,720
We know that.

2380
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:04,960
I'm saying Q tells us stuff and all of its lies is what I'm saying.

2381
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:09,680
You keep interrupting me because you're lying god damn thing out of your people's mouth

2382
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:10,680
doesn't come true.

2383
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:14,360
And it's always, oh, there's energy and oh, now we're done with Trump.

2384
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:16,080
You said he was the Messiah.

2385
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,720
You said he was invincible.

2386
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:18,720
You said it was all over.

2387
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,720
They were all going to get more.

2388
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,960
Now, oh, he's part of a larger thing of Q.

2389
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,600
I will not suffer your Q people after this.

2390
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:30,720
I knew what you were day one, I know what you are now, and I'm sick of it.

2391
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:36,440
I'm sick of all these witches and warlocks and pumpkin popsums and everything.

2392
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:37,440
Sorry.

2393
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:44,200
Bye bye Q, I can't talk to you anymore, Jesus, Lord help me.

2394
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:48,360
That was an uncalled for response, I would say.

2395
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:52,080
Dan, if he's sick of those witches, I think it's time to call Larry Nichols.

2396
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,080
Yeah.

2397
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:59,080
Um, I think that, you know, I don't know if Alex had the same preoccupation with Guantanamo

2398
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:03,280
Bay as the Q folks did, but he definitely had a lot of like, they're about to get arrested

2399
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:04,280
kind of bullshit.

2400
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:05,280
They're going to jail soon.

2401
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:08,400
Trump is invincible is certainly like a theme of...

2402
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,720
I mean, he's literally chosen by God to defeat the devil.

2403
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:14,480
Alex has said that a whole bunch of times.

2404
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:18,520
There's not a lot of light between these two ideologies.

2405
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:22,720
And I think that one of the reasons that Alex does do that fake blowing up there is because

2406
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:29,160
I think it's like the way he's presented Q and QAnon stuff is very different than what

2407
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:31,560
this guy is bringing to the table.

2408
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:35,600
And for the audience to become aware that like, oh no, they're not all crazy the way

2409
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,480
that Alex wants you to think.

2410
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,440
There's talk about the Federal Reserve.

2411
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,680
There's talk about these deep underground bases.

2412
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:42,680
There's demons.

2413
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:45,140
Hey, I like that.

2414
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:47,760
The elites are sacrificing kids and drinking their blood.

2415
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,320
Alex is in on that.

2416
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:51,360
Maybe there's something I should look into here.

2417
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,080
Alex runs the risk of this blowing up right in his face.

2418
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:58,120
If you get to see clearly that they're pretty similar.

2419
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:02,640
I think I would also argue that there's nothing Alex hates more than a mirror, especially

2420
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:05,000
one that's younger than him.

2421
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,960
Like that's... because listen to the way he's talking, he's rambling, he's saying all kinds

2422
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:09,960
of nonsense.

2423
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:12,920
He's rattling off bullshit that he's memorized.

2424
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:17,320
He's unwilling to be interrupted for any stretch, for any reason.

2425
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:18,920
He's claiming his space.

2426
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:19,920
Exactly.

2427
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,920
This is an... like this dude is a person who loves Alex Jones.

2428
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:30,240
Who has developed much of his persona clearly around his love of Alex Jones.

2429
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:34,020
Yeah, it's at least a strong influence.

2430
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:37,480
No one hates Alex, maybe, more than Alex.

2431
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:39,800
And no one hates people who like Alex, more than Alex.

2432
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:40,800
Yeah, exactly.

2433
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:41,800
But you know what?

2434
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:42,800
Owen kind of likes the shaman.

2435
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:43,800
Ugh.

2436
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:50,120
I want to believe that they'll never, when they're wrong, say they're wrong.

2437
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:53,640
Oh no, Trump's a small part of the larger Q universe.

2438
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:54,640
Ninjutsu.

2439
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:55,640
Ninjutsu.

2440
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:56,640
Really?

2441
01:41:56,640 --> 01:41:57,640
No, you're full of crap.

2442
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:58,640
Ninjutsu.

2443
01:41:58,640 --> 01:41:59,640
We don't want your last word.

2444
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:00,640
Oh!

2445
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:01,640
Oh!

2446
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:02,640
Oh!

2447
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:03,640
Only if it...

2448
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:04,640
Is he Q?

2449
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:05,640
We have Q on the line.

2450
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:11,000
Yeah, sure, we'll get a last word from Lord Q on the other side.

2451
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,360
So they go to commercial break, and they come back, and Alex is true to his word.

2452
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:16,960
He is going to give the shaman a last word.

2453
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:25,600
Alright, I'm gonna be nice to the Q sorcerer, Q wizard, no no, the official name is the

2454
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:27,880
Q shaman.

2455
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,360
He's hopping mad at me.

2456
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,300
But people started to recognize something, as soon as I showed up at the Capitol two

2457
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:38,800
days ago, Owen was right beside me, he disappeared for several hours in a phone booth and came

2458
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:42,440
out as the Q wizard.

2459
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:43,440
Good bit.

2460
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:44,440
That's the bit, huh?

2461
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:45,440
Oh boy.

2462
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,920
I would say that he's right to be really mad at him.

2463
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:48,920
Yeah.

2464
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:52,760
And so he does get his last word, the shaman gets his last word, and it's just a long plug

2465
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:56,640
for his Rumble page, because he's not allowed on YouTube.

2466
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:57,800
Sure, well yeah.

2467
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:01,360
And then Alex calls him a lightweight.

2468
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:06,840
I got stuff on there exposing the UN, I got stuff on there about aliens and the truth

2469
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:10,600
about aliens and where aliens come from, how they're actually inter-dimensional beings,

2470
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:15,640
just as much as they are like, quote unquote, extraterrestrial beings, I've got a video

2471
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:19,760
on there called Just Take the Red Pill, that's five and a half hours, that if you really

2472
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:22,960
want to know everything that there really is to know to get caught up to speed here

2473
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:26,640
and now, all you have to do is just watch that one video and it'll explain a whole lot

2474
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:27,640
of things that most people don't understand.

2475
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:28,640
That's two end games.

2476
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:29,640
Okay, that's enough.

2477
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:34,240
I've heard the plug about you, you didn't counter anything we said, the whole cube image

2478
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:38,160
looks completely full of crap and has been full of crap the entire time, it's a big

2479
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:40,680
sick joke on us, it probably just cost us the country.

2480
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:41,680
Thanks for the call.

2481
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:45,720
I mean, I just, I cannot, Matt Bragg, you had to sit through 20 minutes of that insufferable

2482
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:50,680
garbage, and I'm not trying, he's a well-meaning person, but he's a lightweight man.

2483
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:54,200
It's all this Harry Potter, hocus pocus crap, and we're in the real world.

2484
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:58,040
I'm like, I'm not going to tell this guy what's going on, because he can't even handle

2485
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,040
it, but it's, he just doesn't get it, does he?

2486
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:03,360
All this Harry Potter crap, and now I'm going to talk to you about the devil.

2487
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:09,720
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, the shaman who's dealing with ley lines and quantum

2488
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:12,000
physics just can't handle it?

2489
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Can't handle it.

2490
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I think he could handle it.

2491
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,560
No, Alex, Alex wants to give the appearance that he has something deeper, but if he was

2492
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:23,320
forced to actually talk about it, it would be like when he's on Rogan and he realized

2493
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:24,320
like, oh, he doesn't really have anything.

2494
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,320
He doesn't know anything.

2495
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:26,320
No.

2496
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:27,320
God.

2497
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:28,320
That's really a dumb thing to do.

2498
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:29,880
I hate him so much.

2499
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:37,300
Alex is not good at confrontational interviews with sincere people, because they aren't running

2500
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:41,200
a scam that they care about what Alex thinks about.

2501
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:45,080
You know, like there's probably some emotional level that the Q shaman would like to have

2502
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:47,160
a positive exchange with Alex.

2503
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:53,440
He looks up to him, but he also isn't invested in the Infowars scam in the same way that

2504
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,600
all of Alex's guests are.

2505
01:44:55,600 --> 01:45:00,960
Matt Bracken has no other like media outlet that will ever talk to him.

2506
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,280
No one gives a fuck about him except for Alex.

2507
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:05,040
And so he's part of the game.

2508
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:10,600
Owen Troyer works, everybody that he talks to is at least in some way, um...

2509
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:11,600
Transactional.

2510
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:12,600
Yeah.

2511
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,600
There's a power dynamic.

2512
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,540
Either Alex is higher or lower.

2513
01:45:15,540 --> 01:45:17,660
Everybody knows where they stand.

2514
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:20,500
Everybody knows that they're working towards the shared goal of grifting.

2515
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:22,920
And Alex can work really well in that space.

2516
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:29,160
Or at least he can operate there because people know not to contradict him, not to get too

2517
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:30,160
out of line.

2518
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:32,520
If he interrupts you, just roll with it.

2519
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:37,120
But yeah, you got someone like the Q shaman, and he thinks that he is higher on the totem

2520
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:38,120
pole.

2521
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:39,120
The power dynamic is different.

2522
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,400
He just stormed the Capitol.

2523
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:44,160
I bet that dude's riding a wave of adrenaline that is still going.

2524
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:45,440
Well, he's in jail now, so...

2525
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:49,280
Yeah, and I bet he's fucking flying off the walls.

2526
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,700
Yeah, it's complicated.

2527
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:54,680
There's a power imbalance, but it's, uh, uh...

2528
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:55,680
Perceptional.

2529
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:56,680
Yeah.

2530
01:45:56,680 --> 01:46:00,720
They each think that they're the top dog on this call, and it infuriates Alex.

2531
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:05,160
Yeah, I imagine that the Q shaman thought he was doing a victory lap.

2532
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:12,080
You know, I just got the most national attention, worldwide attention, my picture's on the world

2533
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:16,200
right now, so Alex Jones is calling me because I'm fucking famous.

2534
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:20,400
Yeah, and maybe we have some slight disagreements, but we can work that out.

2535
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:24,200
And I'm a fan of his, so I'll charm him up top, we'll have a nice little conversation.

2536
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:25,280
He's a rational guy.

2537
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:28,200
We agree with each other on everything.

2538
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:32,360
Why would he not take me at my word as a sincere person?

2539
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:36,880
We agree on literally everything about the globalists and the blood drinking and the

2540
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:38,280
Chinese and the communists.

2541
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:40,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on, Alex.

2542
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:44,640
Hold on, are you saying that I can't trust far-right media figures because they will

2543
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:48,640
cut bait and abandon me as soon as I'm not useful to them?

2544
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:49,640
Uh-oh.

2545
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:50,640
Uh-oh.

2546
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:51,640
I might need to rethink.

2547
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:52,640
Nothing!

2548
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:56,960
I mean, and also, not for nothing, Alex is far from the only person who's shitting on

2549
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:58,800
this dude for doing exactly what...

2550
01:46:58,800 --> 01:46:59,800
They want to do.

2551
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:00,800
Yeah.

2552
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:01,800
And they were told to do.

2553
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:02,800
Yeah.

2554
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:03,800
Yeah.

2555
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:04,800
It's kind of...

2556
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:05,800
Ugh.

2557
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:08,200
It's kind of like the most predictable thing ever.

2558
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:12,000
I wonder if anybody had said that this would happen.

2559
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,240
So Alex, look, if he was there, things would have gone differently.

2560
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:18,080
He probably would have tackled the Q shaman.

2561
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,080
Sure.

2562
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:20,080
We had a rally.

2563
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:21,080
Trump won it.

2564
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:22,080
We had other rallies.

2565
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,080
They were great.

2566
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:24,080
I'm like, oh, the Capitol Police will handle it.

2567
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,080
Yeah, Antifa says they're coming to disrupt.

2568
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:26,080
They'll handle it.

2569
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,080
And we should have been down there.

2570
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:29,320
If I'd have been there with 20 of our guys, we would have stopped this.

2571
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:30,320
Yeah, man.

2572
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:31,320
We would have stopped it.

2573
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:33,120
If I and 20 guys...

2574
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:34,120
Of our guys.

2575
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:38,460
Of our guys, who are specifically very large, I hired them from the same people that Antifa

2576
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:39,460
hired from.

2577
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:42,400
If 20 of our guys couldn't get 20 of them because they were busy at the time.

2578
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,560
Yeah, they were hired by Antifa.

2579
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:46,900
I mean, no, okay.

2580
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:51,600
So we have one last clip here from the 8th, and in the same way that the out of context

2581
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:58,400
drop that I'll get to this next segment, maybe, is a perfect, just boiled down Alex Jones

2582
01:47:58,400 --> 01:47:59,400
moment.

2583
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:00,400
Sure.

2584
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,240
This minute is this is Alex right here, baby.

2585
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:06,480
The Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m., ahead of the great job you're doing, Sunday live, that's

2586
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:09,060
6 to 8, with only six minutes of ads an hour.

2587
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:11,780
We've cut it to just local ads for radio and TV stations.

2588
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:12,780
We've cut our ads.

2589
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:16,320
And if I wasn't partnered with GCN, who are wonderful people, I would cut us from the

2590
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:17,900
14 minute ads.

2591
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:21,420
It's customary and talk radio, you know, to to less just for locals.

2592
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:22,480
But I love to have that.

2593
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:27,280
I'm working on just having local ads for you folks and cutting it to six, seven minutes

2594
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:29,640
of ads an hour just for local stations.

2595
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:31,880
I wonder why our plugs once an hour live on air.

2596
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:32,880
I'm about to right now.

2597
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:36,620
Ladies and gentlemen, we've proven we're the tip of the spear.

2598
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:40,040
We've proven that we're dialed in to as much as you can learn.

2599
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:42,520
And believe me, you learn nobody's in control.

2600
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,700
But God, the devil's trying to be in control.

2601
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:45,840
He's not in control.

2602
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,400
And man's trying to control.

2603
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:48,640
That's a joke.

2604
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:52,320
So gzping and communism claiming government can be God's a lie.

2605
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,720
Q claiming everything's great and everybody's got a plan.

2606
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:55,720
That's a lie.

2607
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:56,960
The only plan is Jesus Christ plan.

2608
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:59,360
I'm here to tell you that only trust in God.

2609
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:03,380
That's the only perfect thing there is in full work store dot com, though, gives you

2610
01:49:03,380 --> 01:49:04,680
what God created.

2611
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:11,540
Our official that's good.

2612
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:12,540
Give it to me.

2613
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:13,540
Yeah.

2614
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:14,600
Inject that into my veins.

2615
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:17,240
That's the kind of ad pivot that will give you an overdose.

2616
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:19,240
You don't have to.

2617
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:20,240
Yeah.

2618
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:21,240
Damn.

2619
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:23,040
There's so many awesome layers to that.

2620
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:26,400
It starts with him talking about wanting to have less commercials on the show.

2621
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,400
Sure.

2622
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:29,120
And then he's wanting to definitely not.

2623
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:30,120
Right.

2624
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:31,120
Ted Anderson won't let him.

2625
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:32,120
Yeah.

2626
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:33,120
Interesting.

2627
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:34,600
That business relationship.

2628
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:35,600
Sure.

2629
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:39,520
But then he's like, you know, we do our ads on the show, like I'm about to do.

2630
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:40,520
Yeah.

2631
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:42,980
Then he starts talking about how God's plan is.

2632
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:45,320
So that was intended to be part of the plot.

2633
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:46,320
Indeed.

2634
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,640
And you trust God's plan and it in for store.

2635
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:49,640
What do you get?

2636
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:50,640
All the stuff that got me.

2637
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:51,640
Oh, baby.

2638
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:52,720
Like krill oil.

2639
01:49:52,720 --> 01:50:00,880
I don't know if you can possibly take the like by definition of those like those words

2640
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:03,360
like there were 10 of them.

2641
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:05,080
Pretty important to people who love the Bible.

2642
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:06,080
Yeah.

2643
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,080
All right.

2644
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:12,080
I'm fairly certain that you cannot take God's name in vain more than he just did.

2645
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:14,840
I think that's the most you can do.

2646
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:16,880
There was some vainness to it.

2647
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:19,160
There is a little bit of vainness there.

2648
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:20,160
Yeah.

2649
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:25,780
So I find I find this stretch right after the storming of the Capitol at the end of

2650
01:50:25,780 --> 01:50:26,780
last week.

2651
01:50:26,780 --> 01:50:32,000
Kind of interesting, but also kind of kind of I don't know.

2652
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,280
I guess what you'd expect.

2653
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:35,720
You know, it is it is.

2654
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:36,720
Sorry.

2655
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,600
I want to sorry to regress for one second.

2656
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:39,600
No, no.

2657
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:40,600
Go ahead.

2658
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:44,360
I would like you to play just the short clip of him saying, we've proven that we're the

2659
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:51,560
tip of the spear right next to go home, go home curfew, go home respect to the curfew.

2660
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:52,560
Exactly.

2661
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:53,920
Tom Papert saying he sent his reporters home.

2662
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:54,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

2663
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:55,920
The women.

2664
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:56,920
Yeah.

2665
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:57,920
We've proven where the tip is.

2666
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:58,920
Sorry.

2667
01:50:58,920 --> 01:50:59,920
Sorry for interrupting you.

2668
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:00,920
Oh no, that's fine.

2669
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:01,920
I just needed to be to get that out.

2670
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:06,200
I would be lying if I said that any of this surprised me.

2671
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:09,240
Like Alex's behavior is very predictable.

2672
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:13,980
You know, you want you want the ride to the the storming.

2673
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:15,920
You don't want the storming to actually happen.

2674
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:24,100
He needs that that that state prior to conflagration to make money off of because let's say they

2675
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:26,440
had set fire to the Capitol building.

2676
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:27,440
Right.

2677
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:35,040
Then it investigations would be very crippling to to to right wing organizations, militias

2678
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:36,040
figures.

2679
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:37,040
Not good.

2680
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:42,220
You know, if more people had died, it certainly would be far more serious.

2681
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:47,080
And Alex can't profit in that that ecosystem, that environment.

2682
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:51,100
And so obviously this is, you know, put the blame on somebody else.

2683
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:55,600
This is a false flag because they were scared of how close we were to getting that 10 days

2684
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:57,880
that Rudy wanted and we'd overturn the election.

2685
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:58,880
Yeah.

2686
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,600
And also at the same time, Trump has shown his ass.

2687
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:03,960
And so he's too weak and we need to look for new leadership.

2688
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:06,160
It's it's all very predictable.

2689
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:07,160
Yeah.

2690
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:08,580
It's just so brutal.

2691
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:15,040
It's so brutal that the tactic after this is not because it's it's so obvious.

2692
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:17,040
Like all right.

2693
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:21,900
You see the way acts now and you work backwards and you go, oh, obviously he wants to rile

2694
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:27,780
people up into a state of constant fury and then that will get him money.

2695
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:30,580
Their emotional connection will get him money.

2696
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:34,340
And then when they did something, he realized that that would cost him money.

2697
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:37,780
And so he stopped, he changed his mind, quote unquote.

2698
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:39,420
He betrayed us.

2699
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:42,240
And so we can't trust him anymore.

2700
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:46,500
And instead it's just, how about I throw two different types of cognitive dissonance at

2701
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:52,640
you all the time into your brain so much and so hard that you can't even see through that

2702
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:55,480
I'm obviously in this for money.

2703
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:56,480
Yeah.

2704
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:57,840
How can you not see through that?

2705
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,280
How could you not see through when he says like God's plan is the only one that's real

2706
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:02,280
and info restore.

2707
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:03,280
You can get what God gave you.

2708
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:06,780
I mean, how could you not like think this guy is a fucking asshole?

2709
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:07,780
Totally.

2710
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:09,620
Now that I agree with you, but you know what?

2711
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:10,940
Peace time is peace time.

2712
01:53:10,940 --> 01:53:14,460
People are fucking lazy and full of shit.

2713
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:17,940
This was a day after the goddamn storming of the Capitol.

2714
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:18,940
Two.

2715
01:53:18,940 --> 01:53:19,940
Two days after.

2716
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:20,940
Day and two days.

2717
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:24,660
That should be fresh enough into your mind to where you go, oh, I got knocked out of

2718
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:27,740
the head space that I was normally in and it's just nothing.

2719
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:28,740
Yeah.

2720
01:53:28,740 --> 01:53:33,940
Well, I mean, we saw how quickly he went to like, first of all, calling Sandy Hook a false

2721
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:34,940
flag.

2722
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:35,940
Yeah.

2723
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:39,500
We saw how quickly the Boston bombing became a conspiracy and it makes sense.

2724
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:43,260
Like the fact that this is a giant event.

2725
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:44,260
Sure.

2726
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:45,260
And I honestly don't.

2727
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:49,220
But he wasn't leading the Boston bombing and he wasn't at Sandy Hook.

2728
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:50,220
He was there.

2729
01:53:50,220 --> 01:53:54,420
But that's, that's what makes it even more critical for him to make it a false flag.

2730
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:55,420
Yeah.

2731
01:53:55,420 --> 01:53:57,900
A good thing that went bad because of the trickery of Antifa.

2732
01:53:57,900 --> 01:53:58,900
Yeah.

2733
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:02,460
He has an even greater connection to it.

2734
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:06,900
But that, that again, this goes to one of the other theses that I have.

2735
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:11,860
And that is that one of the primary ways that Alex makes money is by profiting off of and

2736
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:12,860
exploiting tragedy.

2737
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:13,860
Yeah.

2738
01:54:13,860 --> 01:54:14,860
And this is a tragedy.

2739
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:17,720
No matter what, like ends up coming from it.

2740
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:22,820
And I don't think that we have fully processed the reality of the last week.

2741
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:23,820
Oh no, absolutely.

2742
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:26,700
And I don't think that you could, I just don't.

2743
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:30,380
It's staggering and almost surreal.

2744
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:31,380
Yeah.

2745
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:32,380
I don't know.

2746
01:54:32,380 --> 01:54:33,380
Yeah.

2747
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:34,380
And nothing good.

2748
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:35,380
It's not good.

2749
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:36,380
No.

2750
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:38,660
And that is the kind of thing that Alex can make money off of.

2751
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:44,660
The only thing I would say I was kind of surprised about is the turning tack a little bit about

2752
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:45,780
the woman who got shot.

2753
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:46,780
Yeah.

2754
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:51,940
I don't think that I felt him martyr building as much as he was the day of.

2755
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:56,220
Well, you can't martyr build and deescalate.

2756
01:54:56,220 --> 01:54:58,660
You can only do one or the other.

2757
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:00,780
Once you got a martyr, you're going up.

2758
01:55:00,780 --> 01:55:01,780
It does.

2759
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:02,780
There's no going back.

2760
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:03,780
It does seem that way.

2761
01:55:03,780 --> 01:55:09,140
And I think the fact that she was really into Q kind of hurt his ability to create the perfect

2762
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:10,140
figure out of that.

2763
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:11,140
Yeah.

2764
01:55:11,140 --> 01:55:15,120
You can't scream at how stupid Q shaman is and then be like, this Q believer is also

2765
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:17,380
our new Virgin Mary.

2766
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:18,380
Yeah.

2767
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:24,060
You can turn them into a figure of empathy and reverence.

2768
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:25,060
Yeah.

2769
01:55:25,060 --> 01:55:30,700
And the path that they were going down on the sixth couldn't be continued.

2770
01:55:30,700 --> 01:55:37,420
Anyway, I have a feeling that shit's going to be bad this week.

2771
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:43,780
If the plan or the thing that's been speculated is that there may be another impeachment article

2772
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:45,700
coming down on Monday.

2773
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:49,460
And if that's the case, then I would expect that Alex is going to have some choice words

2774
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:50,800
about that.

2775
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,020
And so we'll see what happens.

2776
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:58,180
But I don't look, I don't, I don't see by future prospects of relaxing being that good.

2777
01:55:58,180 --> 01:56:00,220
I do love how stupid America is.

2778
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:01,220
Yeah.

2779
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:02,220
It's incredibly stupid.

2780
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:09,380
It's so unbelievably, ridiculously stupid to stop for one second and think on Wednesday,

2781
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:14,260
the president had cited a riot and people stormed the Capitol building.

2782
01:56:14,260 --> 01:56:20,820
So because of this action, we will swiftly draw up articles of impeachment, which we

2783
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:27,940
will absolutely be delivering to the Senate 100 days after Biden's inauguration, thus

2784
01:56:27,940 --> 01:56:30,260
solving the problem once and for all.

2785
01:56:30,260 --> 01:56:31,260
Yeah.

2786
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:32,260
Yeah.

2787
01:56:32,260 --> 01:56:36,780
I mean, I don't know what else you do, but I don't, I don't, well, you got a couple of

2788
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:37,780
years.

2789
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:38,780
All right.

2790
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:39,780
So we'll be back.

2791
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:40,780
But until then Jordan, we have a website.

2792
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:41,780
We do have a website.

2793
01:56:41,780 --> 01:56:42,780
It's knowledgefight.com.

2794
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:43,780
We're also on Twitter.

2795
01:56:43,780 --> 01:56:44,780
We are on Twitter.

2796
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:46,860
It's at knowledge underscore fight not go to pet Jordan.

2797
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:48,300
We're also on Facebook.

2798
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:54,380
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

2799
01:56:54,380 --> 01:56:55,820
doing God's work right now.

2800
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:56,820
Oh, we'll be back.

2801
01:56:56,820 --> 01:56:57,820
But until then, I'm Neo.

2802
01:56:57,820 --> 01:56:58,820
I'm Leo.

2803
01:56:58,820 --> 01:56:59,820
I'm DZX Clark.

2804
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:00,820
I'm Daryl Rundis.

2805
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:08,660
I, if I had 21 guys, I could defeat Alex and 20 guys.

2806
01:57:08,660 --> 01:57:09,660
Maybe not.

2807
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:10,660
Probably not.

2808
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:11,660
I'm not really much help.

2809
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:12,660
Andy in Kansas.

2810
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:13,660
You're on the air.

2811
01:57:13,660 --> 01:57:14,660
Thanks for holding.

2812
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:15,660
Hello, Alex.

2813
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:16,660
I'm a first time caller.

2814
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:17,660
I'm a huge fan.

2815
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:18,660
I love your work.

2816
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:47,660
I love you.
