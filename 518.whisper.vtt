WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:23.960
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying, we are the bad guys, knowledge

00:23.960 --> 00:33.960
fight.

00:33.960 --> 01:02.680
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan, I'm Jordan, we're a couple of dudes

01:02.680 --> 01:06.800
like to sit around drink novelty beverages and talk a little tiny bit about Alex Jones.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.800
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.800
Jordan.

01:08.800 --> 01:09.800
Dan!

01:09.800 --> 01:10.800
Jordan.

01:10.800 --> 01:11.800
I have a quick question for you.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.800
What's up?

01:12.800 --> 01:13.800
What's your bright spot today?

01:13.800 --> 01:17.800
My bright spot today is, I don't know, it's hard to find a bright spot, but a friend of

01:17.800 --> 01:19.600
mine recommended a game called Hades.

01:19.600 --> 01:20.600
Hades?

01:20.600 --> 01:21.600
I heard of that!

01:21.600 --> 01:22.600
Yeah.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.600
Yeah, it's like Diablo, maybe?

01:23.600 --> 01:24.600
Yeah, I guess.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.600
A little bit like that.

01:25.600 --> 01:26.600
I haven't played Diablo.

01:26.600 --> 01:27.600
I don't know.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.120
My friend Crane recommended it to me, and it's a lot of fun.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.120
It's a lot of fun.

01:31.120 --> 01:34.160
It's a good thing for background...slashin', hackin', doin' the whole thing.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.540
I don't know.

01:35.540 --> 01:38.480
It's a good thing for background entertainment.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.480
I like it.

01:39.480 --> 01:40.480
That's fantastic.

01:40.480 --> 01:45.720
Yeah, so I mean like in times where it's tough for a bright spot, we've got another video

01:45.720 --> 01:46.720
game.

01:46.720 --> 01:47.720
Yeah.

01:47.720 --> 01:48.720
What a shock.

01:48.720 --> 01:49.720
We're inside!

01:49.720 --> 01:50.720
Yeah.

01:50.720 --> 01:51.720
How about you?

01:51.720 --> 01:55.560
I have a bright spot, and also an incredibly dark spot.

01:55.560 --> 02:02.680
My bright spot is that I found out that my parents had COVID and they survived with no...like,

02:02.680 --> 02:04.200
they didn't have to go to the hospital.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.200
That's...that's...

02:05.200 --> 02:06.200
Fantastic.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.200
I mean, comparatively?

02:07.200 --> 02:08.200
Yes.

02:08.200 --> 02:09.200
Absolutely, yes.

02:09.200 --> 02:10.200
Compared to the alternative?

02:10.200 --> 02:11.200
100%.

02:11.200 --> 02:16.680
The unqualified dark spot, obviously, is that they learned zero from the experiment.

02:16.680 --> 02:17.680
Absolutely nothing.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.400
From the experiment, you say?

02:19.400 --> 02:20.400
I don't mean experiment.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.400
That implies that you...

02:21.400 --> 02:22.400
Experience!

02:22.400 --> 02:25.240
I meant experience, but then I was like, they're all weird.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.720
But...so...yeah!

02:27.720 --> 02:28.720
So it's good.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.960
It's the...they take the good and the bad.

02:31.960 --> 02:32.960
Yeah, it's good.

02:32.960 --> 02:33.960
They're not gone.

02:33.960 --> 02:34.960
No.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.940
Also, I want to kill them.

02:36.940 --> 02:40.000
So it's a real difficult situation that they've put me in.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah, that is tough.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
It's a bind, Dan.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
What are you gonna do?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
What are you gonna do?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
At least they're not dead.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
That's true.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
That's nice!

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yes!

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
I'm hanging...it's a bright spot!

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Sure!

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Bright spot!

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Yes.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Yes.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Throw tomatoes at them!

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Throw tomatoes.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Stock going up.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Going up.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.360
So, Jordan, today what we've got in front of us is a little bit of an after the action

03:03.360 --> 03:04.360
report.

03:04.360 --> 03:05.360
Ah, yes.

03:05.360 --> 03:06.360
As it were.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.960
On our last episode, we talked about the coverage on Infowars the day of January 6th.

03:09.960 --> 03:10.960
Right.

03:10.960 --> 03:14.400
When some ding-dongs were storming the Capitol building.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.480
Great day.

03:15.480 --> 03:22.080
And so today we've got January 7th and 8th, the end of last week, how Alex tried to regroup

03:22.080 --> 03:24.680
and try to figure out where are we going with this.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.920
The post-coital bliss, if you will.

03:26.920 --> 03:29.400
Um, I'm not positive.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.920
There's a lot of stuff that's going on that I would describe as less than blissful.

03:32.920 --> 03:33.920
Less than blissful?

03:33.920 --> 03:34.920
Alright.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.000
Trying to figure out exactly how we're going to make it through and make this profitable.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Sure, sure, sure.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
That's a tough fight.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.880
I'm interested to see what he's got.

03:41.880 --> 03:42.880
Yeah.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.000
And we'll get down to business on that here in a second, but before we do, I'd like to

03:45.000 --> 03:47.440
take a little moment to say thank you to some folks who have signed up on our sporting show.

03:47.440 --> 03:48.440
Oh, that's a great idea.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.160
So first, Amphheseum, thank you so much.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.520
You are now a policy wonk.

03:51.520 --> 03:52.520
I'm a policy wonk!

03:52.520 --> 03:53.520
Thanks, Amphheseum!

03:53.520 --> 03:54.520
Thank you!

03:54.520 --> 03:56.600
James modelingectorb, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

03:56.600 --> 03:57.600
I'm a policy wonk!

03:57.600 --> 03:58.600
Thank you, Trevor!

03:58.600 --> 03:59.600
Thank you!

03:59.600 --> 04:01.400
Next, Jayms, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.400
I'm a policy wonk!

04:02.400 --> 04:03.400
Thanks, Jayms!

04:03.400 --> 04:04.400
Thank you!

04:04.400 --> 04:06.800
Next, George F, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

04:06.800 --> 04:07.800
I'm a policy wonk!

04:07.800 --> 04:09.180
Thank you very much, George!

04:09.180 --> 04:10.180
Thank you!

04:10.180 --> 04:12.260
Next, Nathalie, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

04:12.260 --> 04:13.480
I'm a policy wonk.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.500
Thanks, Nat!

04:14.500 --> 04:15.500
Thank you!

04:15.500 --> 04:17.620
Next, Christopher L, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

04:17.620 --> 04:18.720
I'm a policy wonk!

04:18.720 --> 04:20.360
Thank you, conspiracy of Christopher's!

04:20.360 --> 04:21.360
Oh, boy.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.460
No, they have to shorten it up.

04:22.460 --> 04:25.360
They have to shorten it up? You have to get it? I don't know if that's fair.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.160
It's part of the entry requirement.

04:27.160 --> 04:27.660
That's fair!

04:27.660 --> 04:30.760
It's a holy ritual that the conspiracy of Chris's go on.

04:30.760 --> 04:34.560
They have to physically chop off the all capitals Christopher and chop it.

04:34.560 --> 04:35.360
Yeah, yeah, I get you.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.660
Next, Emily T. Thank you so much. You're now a policy wonk.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.060
I'm a policy wonk.

04:39.060 --> 04:39.760
Thanks Emily!

04:39.760 --> 04:40.160
Thank you!

04:40.160 --> 04:42.960
And then finally, Brandy. Thank you so much. You're now a policy wonk.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.260
I'm a policy wonk.

04:44.260 --> 04:46.260
Thank you very much Brandy. It's Brandy.

04:46.260 --> 04:47.960
Yeah, not the singer.

04:47.960 --> 04:48.660
Oh, not Brandy?

04:48.660 --> 04:50.460
No, the character from the Looking Glass.

04:50.460 --> 04:52.560
Oh, well thank you very much Brandy!

04:52.560 --> 04:53.060
Yeah.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.660
It's good to hear from you. You were inside there for a while.

04:55.660 --> 04:59.660
There's a port on a western bay that serves a hundred sailors a day.

04:59.660 --> 05:00.660
A hundred ships a day.

05:01.660 --> 05:07.360
Love me sailors with their time away thinking about their home.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.260
I love it when you sing.

05:08.260 --> 05:09.460
That's a great song.

05:09.460 --> 05:14.660
Brandy, you're a fine girl. What a good wife you would be.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.760
But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.360
Well, yes, naturally.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.760
So anyway, thank you.

05:20.760 --> 05:21.260
All right.

05:22.360 --> 05:28.660
Jordan, today, I think that anybody who's tuning into this show is probably the most interested in,

05:28.660 --> 05:32.860
or maybe, you know, the most like, what's, you know, because you see things on Twitter.

05:32.860 --> 05:37.860
People have some primed, and something went around, and that was of course that Alex-

05:37.860 --> 05:41.060
Yeah, people were wondering what video games you were playing, and you said Hades,

05:41.060 --> 05:43.060
and then I've actually started it.

05:43.060 --> 05:44.260
No, let's pack it in then.

05:44.260 --> 05:44.760
Okay.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.360
We've given the news report.

05:46.360 --> 05:51.760
No, on Twitter, there was some stuff going around about Alex interviewing the Q shaman.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.060
Oh, he did.

05:53.060 --> 05:53.560
Yes.

05:53.560 --> 05:54.060
Great.

05:54.060 --> 05:54.560
Great.

05:54.560 --> 05:55.560
So this episode-

05:55.560 --> 05:56.560
Helmet on or off?

05:56.560 --> 05:58.260
It's hard to tell over the phone.

05:59.260 --> 06:02.760
This episode will culminate with Alex interviewing the Q shaman.

06:02.760 --> 06:03.960
Great, great, great.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.160
And I'll give you this spoiler.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.660
It doesn't go well.

06:06.660 --> 06:07.460
Why not?

06:07.460 --> 06:09.160
You know who it does go well for actually?

06:09.160 --> 06:10.260
The FBI?

06:10.260 --> 06:11.260
The Q shaman.

06:11.260 --> 06:13.260
Okay, that's not good.

06:13.260 --> 06:14.260
That's not good.

06:14.260 --> 06:20.860
Turns out, you get the Q shaman on the line with Alex, he sounds not as bad as Alex.

06:20.860 --> 06:30.660
Okay, so the guy dressed like fucking Dan Aykroyd in Dragnet is gonna kick Alex Jones' ass.

06:30.660 --> 06:33.060
I'm sorry, let me be a little bit clearer about this.

06:33.060 --> 06:33.560
Yeah.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.560
They both sound crazy.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.560
Okay, well that's fair.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.760
But, he sounds polite.

06:36.760 --> 06:37.260
Okay.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.460
Oh, like Dan Aykroyd in Dragnet.

06:40.460 --> 06:40.960
Sure.

06:40.960 --> 06:46.260
So, before we get to this episode, let's listen to a little out of context drop that actually

06:46.260 --> 06:50.160
I think really, if you've never listened to Alex Jones' show, this almost perfectly sums

06:50.160 --> 06:51.560
up what it's like to listen to him.

06:51.560 --> 06:56.160
I'm gonna explain that next segment, baby.

06:59.160 --> 07:01.960
That is Alex to a T.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.960
I do like that in a news program.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.960
You know, a lot of news programs just give you the news.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.960
Alex at least makes you work for it.

07:08.960 --> 07:12.960
I got a story, it's huge, I'm gonna explain it to you later.

07:12.960 --> 07:13.960
Maybe.

07:13.960 --> 07:14.960
Possibly.

07:15.960 --> 07:20.960
So, at this point we start on the 7th and Alex has learned that more people have passed

07:20.960 --> 07:25.460
away in relation to the storming of the Capitol building.

07:25.460 --> 07:26.460
Correct.

07:26.460 --> 07:31.460
And also apparently he's doubling down on the It Was Antifa narrative.

07:31.460 --> 07:32.460
Sure.

07:32.460 --> 07:37.660
Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are here at the epicenter where four US citizens were

07:37.660 --> 07:43.060
murdered inside and outside the US Capitol by the paramilitary forces there who were

07:43.060 --> 07:48.360
manipulated and triggered by Antifa evidences mounting that posed as Proud Boys so that

07:48.360 --> 07:53.660
they would then attack and so they could then trigger part of the crowd, hundreds of thousands

07:53.660 --> 07:58.560
already massing, to get a small percentage inside the building.

07:58.560 --> 08:04.960
So this is the way that the ball is gonna break for Alex, it's Antifa, they triggered

08:04.960 --> 08:11.260
everything by posing as Proud Boys to set things off and I just, I don't know.

08:11.260 --> 08:15.600
We should have had a contingent in every right-wing propagandist's home like the day after just

08:15.600 --> 08:20.600
ready to slap, like, oh, say it was Antifa, say it was Antifa, just do it, just one more

08:20.600 --> 08:26.520
time, just one more time, say it, and then when he does, slap, forever.

08:26.520 --> 08:30.960
That slap is contingent on the person not being able to explain themselves.

08:30.960 --> 08:31.960
Yes.

08:31.960 --> 08:36.360
I don't know, hey, look, if Alex is trying to come on air and say like, hey, facts are

08:36.360 --> 08:38.320
coming out that this was Antifa.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.320
Totally.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.240
I'd like for him to back that up.

08:41.240 --> 08:44.000
Hey, if you prove it's Antifa, I will believe it's Antifa, Dan.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.960
Well, he's got some intel that he's gonna repeat.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.280
I'm keeping an open mind.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.280
All right.

08:49.280 --> 08:54.240
Let me read you some of the intel that some of our folks got us here in DC.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.480
This is from a lot of different sources.

08:56.480 --> 09:01.840
Antifa and other organizations promoted as always that they would dress in Trump apparel

09:01.840 --> 09:05.360
to infiltrate the event, which is normal activity for them.

09:05.360 --> 09:09.360
Members from the security team did an advanced observation of the Capitol grounds prior to

09:09.360 --> 09:14.960
Trump even arriving to confirm a stage that was set up for the speech and observation

09:14.960 --> 09:22.800
for a group of 100 to 120 folks already assembled chanting F Antifa, dressed in a manner not

09:22.800 --> 09:26.720
consistent with that normally seen from Trump supporters.

09:26.720 --> 09:32.000
Everyone else who came from the event was at the ellipse waiting for Trump's speech.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.040
They were wearing mainly kind of like gray overalls, arm pads, knee pads.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.040
Completely different.

09:39.040 --> 09:43.320
They all kind of look like sons of Congressmen, sons of Senator Kaine was probably there.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.320
Oh yeah, that's crazy.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.320
He was arrested here doing felony type stuff.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.040
In fact, I would guess he was probably there.

09:49.040 --> 09:53.280
The proof that he's laying out that this was Antifa is that there were people who were

09:53.280 --> 09:54.920
dressed in a certain way.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.400
Yeah, they looked a little different.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.000
Uh, I just, I don't...

09:59.000 --> 10:01.480
And Tim Kaine's son had a felony one time.

10:01.480 --> 10:02.480
True.

10:02.480 --> 10:03.480
So he was probably there.

10:03.480 --> 10:04.480
He's probably there.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.920
Everybody who's had a felony was probably there.

10:05.920 --> 10:06.920
This just is thin.

10:06.920 --> 10:11.440
Like it's just, it doesn't, and also I would say that him saying that, oh, they were chanting

10:11.440 --> 10:12.440
fuck Antifa.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.440
Yeah.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.640
It's kind of interesting because the night before Owen Schroyer posted that video of

10:16.640 --> 10:20.600
himself burning a Black Lives Matter flag and everyone was chanting fuck Antifa.

10:20.600 --> 10:21.600
It really does sound...

10:21.600 --> 10:27.240
Well, but it sounds like exactly what you all engage in on a fairly regular basis.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.440
Yeah, yeah.

10:29.440 --> 10:34.020
You could say that this is Antifa doing an amazing impression of you, or it could be

10:34.020 --> 10:38.420
people who are in the communities that you run in and it would be impossible to tell

10:38.420 --> 10:39.760
the difference, I guess.

10:39.760 --> 10:45.400
I would even argue at that point that if Antifa were at fault behind all of this, they might

10:45.400 --> 10:48.720
as well just have joined the Proud Boys.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.600
I don't want them back.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.600
Fair.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.600
Right?

10:52.600 --> 10:53.600
Yeah.

10:53.600 --> 10:59.160
And so what's going on though is that Alex is recognizing that like, shit, I mean, this

10:59.160 --> 11:00.600
is too real.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.600
It happened.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.600
I can't deny this.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.600
Yeah, I know.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.800
We have to lie about it because I told people to do this and then they did it and I don't

11:06.800 --> 11:07.800
want to get caught.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.760
Well, we'll get into that because there are a lot of conversations that are going on around

11:10.760 --> 11:16.840
Alex's behavior on the ground and stuff, and we should discuss that, and we will a little

11:16.840 --> 11:23.320
bit later when Alex gets into it, but he would much rather be like, ah, this is all staged

11:23.320 --> 11:24.320
or something.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.320
But he can't.

11:25.320 --> 11:26.320
No.

11:26.320 --> 11:27.320
Because it happened.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.320
False Flag would be so much better.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.320
Well, yeah.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.440
And so it has to be that like, oh yeah, yeah, you know what?

11:31.440 --> 11:34.240
Some of our people did end up going in there.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.960
I'm not going to be able to deny that.

11:35.960 --> 11:36.960
No.

11:36.960 --> 11:41.640
Because they took pictures and streamed, and Gavin McGinnis was there apparently.

11:41.640 --> 11:45.680
Look, they got tricked into doing it.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.400
So that's what Andy said they were coming to do.

11:48.400 --> 11:53.880
They're all trust fund kids, sons of U.S. senators, sons of Congress people, academics,

11:53.880 --> 12:01.760
devil worshiping, child molesting, Chicom loving, America hating, trash of the planet.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.480
And the police got attacked.

12:03.480 --> 12:04.940
The police got hit.

12:04.940 --> 12:09.960
They then came out when the crowd saw that and even said, let's get them.

12:09.960 --> 12:14.160
Some patriots responded because they didn't want to be bullied and got suckered into this.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.160
That's what happened.

12:15.160 --> 12:18.480
Trump needs to go on the offense, start exposing this.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.480
Yeah.

12:19.480 --> 12:22.520
So that's the way the narrative is starting to take shape.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.520
Yeah.

12:23.520 --> 12:24.680
It's not strong.

12:24.680 --> 12:32.280
So I think that's kind of a struggle there because aren't we also trying to make a what's

12:32.280 --> 12:34.340
her face into a martyr?

12:34.340 --> 12:37.200
So was she- Well, Alex by this point has learned that

12:37.200 --> 12:38.720
she was really into QAnon.

12:38.720 --> 12:39.720
Right.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.040
So she can be cut bait.

12:41.040 --> 12:42.040
Well, no.

12:42.040 --> 12:46.240
She is, you know, it is a tragedy and it's very sad.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.240
Sure.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.440
But she got tricked into doing this by QAnon.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.440
Okay.

12:50.440 --> 12:57.440
So now all open warfare on Q. QAnon may also be Antifa or a psyop or something.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.440
I like this.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.440
I don't know.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.440
Let's add this in there.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.440
I like QAnon being Antifa.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.600
Let's throw that in there.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.400
It gets a little murky as these go along.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.400
Why not?

13:05.400 --> 13:06.680
They don't have any allegiances.

13:06.680 --> 13:07.680
Listen to me.

13:07.680 --> 13:15.520
There's one thing that I know from blowhards and that is they like to talk about how they

13:15.520 --> 13:17.120
could have averted disasters.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.120
Yes.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.120
Yeah.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.120
Yeah.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.120
If only they had been there.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.120
Real Mark Wahlberg situation.

13:22.120 --> 13:23.120
Exactly.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.120
Yeah.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.120
Yeah.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.120
If he was on that plane, there wouldn't have been a 9-11.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.120
Wouldn't have happened.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.120
No.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.120
And we just should have been there.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.120
I should have been there instead of at the Trump speech.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.760
In fact, I was tempted to not go to the Trump speech and be at the Capitol.

13:33.760 --> 13:36.640
I wanted to race down and not wait for Trump and get to the Capitol.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.000
That's what my gut told me.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.240
And we could have told people, that's Antifa, we could have tackled them, pulled off their

13:42.240 --> 13:43.240
mask.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.760
I would have happened to have been arrested and we would have stopped these pieces of

13:45.760 --> 13:46.760
filth.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.680
So yeah, he could have tackled all the Antifa.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.160
If only Alex had been there.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.160
Oh boy.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.160
He could have saved the day.

13:53.160 --> 13:57.640
That's one of those lies that just elevated to the point of just like, nah.

13:57.640 --> 13:58.640
Yeah.

13:58.640 --> 13:59.640
Yeah.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.920
Like I'm so far beyond the before you started that lie.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.720
When you started that lie, I'm just out.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.720
Yeah.

14:05.720 --> 14:12.400
And if you go back to yesterday, when your employee said, the Capitol has fallen.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.400
The Patriots are now in charge.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.480
It's a new day, Dan.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.200
Today the Patriots are not in charge.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.200
So we can't celebrate.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.200
Shit got too real.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.200
So that was Antifa.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.200
Yeah.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.200
That was Antifa.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.200
Yeah.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.600
So I'm interested in their evidence.

14:26.600 --> 14:30.120
I'm interested in what they're going to bring to the table in terms of like, how are you

14:30.120 --> 14:32.740
going to show that this is Antifa?

14:32.740 --> 14:35.480
And Owen Troyer actually has a pretty interesting theory.

14:35.480 --> 14:36.480
All right.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.480
Yeah.

14:37.480 --> 14:41.560
Keep in mind too, that, you know, every time we have these events in DC, you always see

14:41.560 --> 14:43.640
Antifa and BLM out on the streets.

14:43.640 --> 14:48.960
They are not anywhere to be seen in this week because they're all wearing Trump gear.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.160
They're all posing as journalists.

14:50.160 --> 14:54.000
They're all just infiltrating all the Trump stuff because they have no effect now dressing

14:54.000 --> 14:57.240
in all black with black block going around, they get their ass kicked by proud boys.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.240
The police are sick of them.

14:58.240 --> 15:02.920
So now they pretend to be Patriots, they infiltrate and then they cause all this disruption.

15:02.920 --> 15:08.400
I didn't see anybody who I decided was Antifa and therefore they must be hidden in plain

15:08.400 --> 15:10.600
sight dressed like Trump supporters.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.600
Yeah.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.800
Therefore they false flagged us.

15:14.800 --> 15:15.800
This is so weird.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.360
I have a serious question for you, Dan.

15:17.360 --> 15:24.480
Are you trying to turn me into some sort of superhero vigilante with a tragic backstory?

15:24.480 --> 15:25.480
No.

15:25.480 --> 15:32.120
Because it seems like this is like listening to Owen say that the day after makes me want

15:32.120 --> 15:37.400
to like dress in all black and train really hard and ninjutsu and then just solve problems

15:37.400 --> 15:38.400
wherever they are.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.400
Right.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
Right.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.240
You know, I'm not trying to do that, but it seems like you're making it happen.

15:43.240 --> 15:49.000
But if it does happen, I will say that you are required to be able to jump between a

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
couple of buildings before you solve any problems.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Hold on.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
You can't prove it's me.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.720
The pictures are grainy, Dan.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.200
There's no evidence that it's me doing any of this.

15:57.200 --> 16:02.680
I will be I will be your Alfred if you can jump between two buildings before you solve

16:02.680 --> 16:03.680
anybody else's problem.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.240
This is why I got to train for at least two or three years.

16:06.240 --> 16:09.120
You might need a little more than two buildings, two years.

16:09.120 --> 16:10.120
That's the rule.

16:10.120 --> 16:15.000
So the name of the game is getting these talking points out into the world and making sure

16:15.000 --> 16:19.320
that this is the reality that people accept muddy the waters, at least muddying the waters

16:19.320 --> 16:20.320
is important.

16:20.320 --> 16:25.240
But the other thing that I think Alex recognizes pretty quickly, and I think he's right, is

16:25.240 --> 16:29.040
like, this is a great opportunity to try and get some Q people back.

16:29.040 --> 16:32.360
Some people might be disillusioned by the fact that, like, they went through all this

16:32.360 --> 16:33.360
trouble.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.360
Nothing happened.

16:34.360 --> 16:38.320
And then Trump, I guess, is conceding what what happened to the plan that happened to

16:38.320 --> 16:39.320
the plan.

16:39.320 --> 16:40.600
Tell me about those ballots again.

16:40.600 --> 16:44.960
They were watermarked and Steve also conspicuous in his absence.

16:44.960 --> 16:45.960
Why?

16:45.960 --> 16:46.960
No, Steve.

16:46.960 --> 16:47.960
What?

16:47.960 --> 16:51.680
We need to talk about talking points based in truth for the president, for America, for

16:51.680 --> 16:54.280
the world, because we don't have any Patriot communications.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.120
The president's been cut off, basically.

16:56.120 --> 16:58.240
The White House is listening to us.

16:58.240 --> 16:59.240
And it's not because we're powerful.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.240
It's because Trump is surrounded.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.240
OK.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.240
And I keep telling everybody, you think he was great.

17:04.240 --> 17:07.240
You don't have to do anything.

17:07.240 --> 17:08.240
Trust the plan.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.240
Everything's wonderful.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.240
That's what's gotten us into this position.

17:10.240 --> 17:11.240
OK.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.400
I'm not basking if you were a Q person.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.960
I'm just telling you now that you have to listen to the talking points.

17:16.960 --> 17:22.280
We have to discuss who was behind this moving now on the offense instead of being on the

17:22.280 --> 17:23.280
defense.

17:23.280 --> 17:28.920
This is a nice way to extend an olive branch to any listeners who might have drifted more

17:28.920 --> 17:32.720
Q than Alex and be like, you can still come back here.

17:32.720 --> 17:36.600
There's nothing against you if you got into this, because it's all supposed to be asking

17:36.600 --> 17:40.080
questions.

17:40.080 --> 17:48.220
This event almost is like a plus one for everybody's media consumption.

17:48.220 --> 17:51.120
If you were a Q person, you go plus one to Info Wars.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.720
If you're Info Wars, you go plus one to Fox News.

17:53.720 --> 17:58.280
And if you're at Fox News, you're like, I have no home, I'll just believe whatever I

17:58.280 --> 17:59.280
feel like.

17:59.280 --> 18:00.280
Maybe.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.280
Yeah.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.280
Yeah.

18:02.280 --> 18:08.080
Maybe there's a sort of like a toe back towards, like, away from the extremism.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.480
For a brief period of time.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.000
And also for people on their couches.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Sure.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.160
Not necessarily the people who were in DC.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.160
Sure.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.160
No, no, no.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.160
That's what I'm referencing.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.160
Yeah.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.160
You know.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.160
Possibly.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.800
I mean, I think we haven't had enough time to see what the actual effects of it are.

18:25.800 --> 18:29.800
But the way that I hear Alex talking about this stuff and the way I see him behaving,

18:29.800 --> 18:32.560
it has the feeling of somebody who sees an opportunity.

18:32.560 --> 18:36.820
And it's an opportunity to get part of that market share that he lost back from all these

18:36.820 --> 18:42.720
QAnon folks who think that he is controlled opposition and works for the Mossad or the

18:42.720 --> 18:43.720
CIA or whatever.

18:43.720 --> 18:44.720
Right.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.720
Right, right, right.

18:45.720 --> 18:46.720
And so, I mean, good.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.720
Not good.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.920
But that's what you should be doing from a business standpoint.

18:49.920 --> 18:50.920
Yeah.

18:50.920 --> 18:51.920
Yeah.

18:51.920 --> 18:55.160
Dan, now do you see where the vigilante part comes into this?

18:55.160 --> 19:00.320
Because if Alex winds up getting more market share out of this and no one stops him, I

19:00.320 --> 19:05.700
feel like there needs to be some sort of all-black-clad ninjutsu master who has trained for two years

19:05.700 --> 19:09.240
and can jump exactly two buildings to solve that problem.

19:09.240 --> 19:12.880
But the way you would solve that problem is by, like, starting your own-

19:12.880 --> 19:13.880
Ninjutsu!

19:13.880 --> 19:16.880
No, I'm starting your own right-wing media outlet.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.040
Okay.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.080
So not even, like, Judo?

19:20.080 --> 19:23.060
No, you should steal some of Alex's market share.

19:23.060 --> 19:25.960
If the problem that you're seeking to solve is that.

19:25.960 --> 19:26.960
All right.

19:26.960 --> 19:27.960
Okay.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.880
So I'll just wear all black and have a radio show at night.

19:29.880 --> 19:30.880
Yeah, there you go.

19:30.880 --> 19:31.880
That's the same thing.

19:31.880 --> 19:32.880
Yeah.

19:32.880 --> 19:37.560
So the Capitol Police, you know, there's a lot of questions that are going around about

19:37.560 --> 19:41.000
their preparedness, their lack of preparedness.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.240
You know, and I think that, you know, we'll learn more in coming days.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.240
Sure.

19:46.240 --> 19:49.880
They decided that they were understaffed on purpose because they were working on this

19:49.880 --> 19:52.120
with Antifa or something.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.120
Okay.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.880
Antifa came in, they had the Capitol understaffed on purpose.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.280
You can see the setup.

19:57.280 --> 20:01.800
They attacked, the police finally pushed back, Antifa pulls out, the police attacked the

20:01.800 --> 20:04.660
Patriots, the Patriots attack, and it was all a setup.

20:04.660 --> 20:09.400
They beautifully played, we need this to be investigated by state police, by citizens,

20:09.400 --> 20:11.520
by grand juries, by investigative journalists.

20:11.520 --> 20:12.800
The FBI is not going to do it.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.080
I mean, I bet Bill Barr was probably in command of this.

20:15.080 --> 20:19.200
Well, and the state police are going to do anything either.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.440
They're all funded by Soros and they have Soros DA so they know there's nothing that's

20:22.440 --> 20:23.440
going to be done.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.440
Yeah.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.480
You talked over, but he did say Antifa works for the deep state.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.480
Yeah.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.480
Yeah.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.480
Yeah.

20:29.480 --> 20:30.480
Yep.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.480
Okay.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.480
Hey, far right guys, go fight those cops.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.480
Go fight them.

20:33.480 --> 20:34.480
Go do it.

20:34.480 --> 20:35.480
There are your enemies.

20:35.480 --> 20:36.480
There are your enemies.

20:36.480 --> 20:37.480
The left.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.480
We were Antifa.

20:38.480 --> 20:43.040
Look, Antifa in this circumstance did exactly what the far right wanted.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.040
Right?

20:44.040 --> 20:48.440
Well, if you look at the responses that were going on as it was happening before shit got

20:48.440 --> 20:49.440
too real.

20:49.440 --> 20:54.680
Um, yeah, I think, I think it was exactly what, so maybe Antifa has been your ally all

20:54.680 --> 20:57.720
along and it's the cops who are your enemy.

20:57.720 --> 20:58.720
Very confusing.

20:58.720 --> 20:59.720
Yes.

20:59.720 --> 21:06.040
So, um, after this all went down, um, Trump pretty quickly on the seventh was put, he

21:06.040 --> 21:11.120
put out that video, uh, where he was like, well, there's going to be a transfer of power

21:11.120 --> 21:13.120
in a more or less conceding.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.120
Yeah.

21:14.120 --> 21:15.800
It was a great little whoopsie doodle moment.

21:15.800 --> 21:16.800
Yeah.

21:16.800 --> 21:22.840
And Alex, I think he recognizes that like Trump is running out of allies.

21:22.840 --> 21:26.600
There are people who are like in his cabinet who are resigning.

21:26.600 --> 21:31.400
There's just a sense of like, Oh no, everyone hates this guy now.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.600
And I think Alex sees this as an opportunity.

21:34.600 --> 21:38.640
What do we do as millions of listeners, as millions of activists with talking points

21:38.640 --> 21:41.020
and narratives to counter what's happening?

21:41.020 --> 21:46.720
What pressure do we put on Trump and Congress because Trump's totally been, uh, abandoned

21:46.720 --> 21:47.720
now.

21:47.720 --> 21:48.720
Now that sounds bad.

21:48.720 --> 21:49.720
That's actually good.

21:49.720 --> 21:55.880
Tell me on this banded by all the snakes around him that now Alex Jones led a March.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.540
Now we're running the show the next 15 days.

21:58.540 --> 22:00.880
He can do so much now to counter them.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.880
Regardless.

22:01.880 --> 22:04.600
We're going to talk about it in the second hour, but pray for awakening.

22:04.600 --> 22:10.300
Hey, uh, this aspiring dictator is a isolated and increasingly desperate and this is good

22:10.300 --> 22:14.520
news because, uh, Hey, uh, everyone else is gone and maybe he'll listen to me now.

22:14.520 --> 22:15.520
True.

22:15.520 --> 22:16.520
That does sound right.

22:16.520 --> 22:17.520
That's fucked.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.520
Yeah.

22:18.520 --> 22:19.520
Yeah.

22:19.520 --> 22:21.720
I guess the good news is that we know the vice president will be like, Hey, don't send

22:21.720 --> 22:22.840
those nukes.

22:22.840 --> 22:23.920
Don't do that.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.600
You don't need, uh, don't send those nukes.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.920
Oh, that's until Trump 25th amendments him.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.720
Oh, that'll be interesting.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.920
That'll be an interesting reversal of fortune.

22:31.920 --> 22:32.920
Yeah.

22:32.920 --> 22:37.120
So Alex is kind of obsessed with the 25th amendment stuff and he's decided that Trump

22:37.120 --> 22:42.600
only released that video where he may or may not have conceded because Pence was threatening

22:42.600 --> 22:45.160
him, uh, with the 25th amendment.

22:45.160 --> 22:51.360
That's probably the phones up and take calls specifically on what you think with 13 days

22:51.360 --> 22:52.360
Trump should do.

22:52.360 --> 22:53.360
Has he conceded?

22:53.360 --> 22:54.360
You can read his tweet.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.260
He said, I think we have the elections stolen.

22:56.260 --> 23:01.400
I'm not agreeing to this fraud, but I will agree to the peaceful transference of power

23:01.400 --> 23:03.480
because they told him we got Mike Pence.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.640
We got the rest of your cabinet.

23:04.640 --> 23:05.640
They're all cowards.

23:05.640 --> 23:09.440
Well, 25th amendment, you're asked right now, they only did that because removing him would

23:09.440 --> 23:11.040
cause a bigger backlash.

23:11.040 --> 23:14.720
Maybe Trump should force them to do a 25th amendment.

23:14.720 --> 23:20.560
Not because he's going to not peacefully transfer power, but because it's a fraud.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.920
So they're scared of the power he still got.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.080
The feeling that I get there is just denial.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.080
Yeah.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.760
That just seems like pretty thick denial.

23:27.760 --> 23:28.760
Yeah.

23:28.760 --> 23:30.640
And uh, that denial goes away by the eighth.

23:30.640 --> 23:33.160
Alex does realize, ah, this is over.

23:33.160 --> 23:34.160
Yeah.

23:34.160 --> 23:38.440
On the seventh, there's still a sense of like, oh no, he's just doing this cause there's

23:38.440 --> 23:39.960
a metaphorical gun to his head.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.400
He's five stages of griefing.

23:41.400 --> 23:42.400
Yes.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.400
Yeah.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.400
Gotcha.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.400
Gotcha.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.400
And he does get into some anger, which is kind of fun.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.560
And then more anger when he talks to the Q shaman.

23:49.560 --> 23:52.520
Was bargaining before anger or after anger?

23:52.520 --> 23:56.400
Uh, bargaining is the, uh, the ad pivots.

23:56.400 --> 24:01.640
Oh, so we're, that would make sense that he's always grieving.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.640
Yeah.

24:02.640 --> 24:03.640
Keep me on air.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.640
Yeah.

24:04.640 --> 24:05.640
And we'll fight the globalists.

24:05.640 --> 24:06.640
Yeah.

24:06.640 --> 24:07.640
That's bargaining.

24:07.640 --> 24:08.640
No, that's fair.

24:08.640 --> 24:14.320
So Alex has Taylor Hanson back on who was the guy who got some video of the shooting

24:14.320 --> 24:15.760
in the, in the Capitol.

24:15.760 --> 24:16.760
Fourth Hanson brother.

24:16.760 --> 24:17.760
Yeah.

24:17.760 --> 24:18.760
Yes.

24:18.760 --> 24:19.760
Uh, mmm, bop.

24:19.760 --> 24:20.760
Uh, no.

24:20.760 --> 24:21.760
Oh, almost a spit take.

24:21.760 --> 24:22.760
Almost.

24:22.760 --> 24:23.800
I was almost a spit take.

24:23.800 --> 24:24.800
You got me.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.360
Um, I apologize.

24:26.360 --> 24:31.520
I made that clarification in our last episode that I got it mixed up.

24:31.520 --> 24:36.960
They're very vague in, uh, or they were on the sixth while they were covering stuff.

24:36.960 --> 24:37.960
Yeah.

24:37.960 --> 24:43.480
There are two pieces of video that are going, uh, around and I got the reference wrong on

24:43.480 --> 24:44.480
them.

24:44.480 --> 24:48.320
There's one that was shot by info Wars, uh, uh, camera person.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.200
And then there's some that was shot by Taylor Hanson.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.200
Right.

24:51.200 --> 24:54.520
The reason that I got it confused is they never clarify that and they interview Taylor

24:54.520 --> 24:58.880
Hanson as somebody who got video of the stuff around the time that they're playing the video

24:58.880 --> 25:00.440
that the info Wars person got.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.440
Right.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.920
And they made a, a hasty assumption.

25:02.920 --> 25:03.920
They weren't helping.

25:03.920 --> 25:09.280
No, but he's back and, uh, they're really, I get the sense that they're working on a

25:09.280 --> 25:14.200
narrative where, uh, Chuck Schumer, uh, called for the killing.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.200
Love it.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.200
All right.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.200
Taylor Hanson was there.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.200
I'm Alex Jones.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.200
I'm Troyer.

25:19.200 --> 25:25.600
You were there, uh, when this poor lady, Ashley Babbitt got executed along with three other

25:25.600 --> 25:26.600
Americans.

25:26.600 --> 25:27.740
They wanted to tell us their names.

25:27.740 --> 25:30.440
They're calling us the terrorists, but they were killing us.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.440
You were there.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.360
Describe, you talked to her before she died.

25:33.360 --> 25:34.360
What happened?

25:34.360 --> 25:35.360
What you witnessed.

25:35.360 --> 25:38.960
And the fact that you saw Chucky Schumer look like it was his security detail that he was,

25:38.960 --> 25:42.680
I guess, one of the blood sacrifices we know, remember he threatened Trump.

25:42.680 --> 25:43.680
He said, have you been abortion?

25:43.680 --> 25:44.680
We will annihilate you.

25:44.680 --> 25:45.680
You will pay.

25:45.680 --> 25:49.480
It was like, well, these are our babies, baby feast.

25:49.480 --> 25:50.480
He seemed to get really upset.

25:50.480 --> 25:51.520
Oh yeah.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.280
Baby feast.

25:53.280 --> 25:56.000
I would watch that movie.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.400
I just, is that like boss baby, but lunchtime, a little bit different.

26:00.400 --> 26:01.400
Oh.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.400
I don't know, man.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.600
It's very much not boss baby.

26:04.600 --> 26:05.600
I don't know.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.200
I don't find this to be a responsible line for him to be taking.

26:08.200 --> 26:13.720
It's like trying to imply that Schumer was like, kill her for blood, blood sacrifice.

26:13.720 --> 26:14.720
Yeah.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.320
It's very, very shitty.

26:16.320 --> 26:21.160
It is, it is real weird whenever you're like, Hey, it was Antifa who did all that.

26:21.160 --> 26:25.760
Now obviously we need to get all the Patriots to kill Chuck Schumer to keep Antifa from

26:25.760 --> 26:28.960
doing all of that stuff that we wanted to happen, but we said we didn't.

26:28.960 --> 26:29.960
Yeah.

26:29.960 --> 26:35.200
It is really almost like a thing you have to diagram in your head.

26:35.200 --> 26:39.600
The points that are trying to be made are so confusing, but that should be expected

26:39.600 --> 26:45.640
because you know, people like Taylor are involved as like sources of information and analysis.

26:45.640 --> 26:50.480
And he's the kind of guy who got into this because of Q.

26:50.480 --> 26:54.520
I believe Q, like what you were saying, Alex, it was a great thing when it first started,

26:54.520 --> 26:57.840
you know, it was, it was a way to introduce people to all the evils of what these globalists

26:57.840 --> 27:01.760
are doing and all this pedophilia, all this satanic worship, all these sacrifices.

27:01.760 --> 27:06.440
And that's how I personally got red pilled, but it led to me doing more independent research.

27:06.440 --> 27:09.640
And I think that's, what's great about Q is they do their own research.

27:09.640 --> 27:10.800
They don't just trust fake news.

27:10.800 --> 27:15.760
And I think that was a great topic about it, but the real downfall of it was trust the

27:15.760 --> 27:16.760
plan.

27:16.760 --> 27:20.160
As you said, you know, you got people staying home when Trump himself are telling them to

27:20.160 --> 27:21.160
come.

27:21.160 --> 27:26.280
So he's got a, he got red pilled by QAnon and his only complaint about it is that trust

27:26.280 --> 27:29.560
the plan idea, which is like, you don't have to get active.

27:29.560 --> 27:30.560
Right.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.560
Right.

27:31.560 --> 27:35.520
But then his comment was that more people should have come on the 6th?

27:35.520 --> 27:36.800
Apparently, yeah.

27:36.800 --> 27:37.800
Okay.

27:37.800 --> 27:38.800
But.

27:38.800 --> 27:39.800
Okay.

27:39.800 --> 27:40.800
But what happened was bad.

27:40.800 --> 27:45.640
Well, no, everything that happened was good except for the part where they went into the

27:45.640 --> 27:46.640
Capitol.

27:46.640 --> 27:47.640
Okay.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.200
And stormed it and did all that stuff.

27:49.200 --> 27:53.520
So they think that if more people had been there to storm the Capitol.

27:53.520 --> 27:58.160
No, it wouldn't have happened because they would have seen the Antifa provocateurs.

27:58.160 --> 28:00.560
Like every single person is a pair of eyes.

28:00.560 --> 28:01.560
Okay.

28:01.560 --> 28:05.880
Any one of those pairs of eyes could have been the one that spotted the Antifa provocateurs

28:05.880 --> 28:06.880
and averted this whole thing.

28:06.880 --> 28:07.880
All right.

28:07.880 --> 28:11.520
One man, if one man had been there named Alex Jones, he would have tackled them.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.560
So it's a percentages thing.

28:13.560 --> 28:14.560
Something like that.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.560
I don't know.

28:15.560 --> 28:16.560
Sure.

28:16.560 --> 28:17.560
Sure.

28:17.560 --> 28:18.560
Great.

28:18.560 --> 28:19.560
Great.

28:19.560 --> 28:20.560
Great.

28:20.560 --> 28:21.560
Great.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.560
Great.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.440
It's like the Antifa pulling a false flag on us.

28:24.440 --> 28:25.440
Yeah.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.440
That's the way it's being presented.

28:26.440 --> 28:28.400
It's really, really frustrating.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.400
Yeah.

28:29.400 --> 28:36.160
And it's pretty frustrating too because it's almost one of the first instances I think

28:36.160 --> 28:39.240
I can think of of Alex showing some vulnerability.

28:39.240 --> 28:42.560
Like he's just yelling about how Antifa kicked their ass.

28:42.560 --> 28:46.000
I'm kicking myself because they were gonna false flag.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
They said they were.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
And I was so busy focusing on Trump and a million people that we let them screw us.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.200
And I don't admit that Antifa kicked our ass and set us up with a gigantic victory because

28:55.200 --> 28:56.200
I'm proud for him.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.200
I don't want it to happen next time.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.200
Well, and the problem was-

28:59.200 --> 29:00.200
I'm pissed off.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.280
The problem was it was a million of us there.

29:02.280 --> 29:04.220
It was a million of us there.

29:04.220 --> 29:05.220
He does have to piss.

29:05.220 --> 29:06.220
I'm sorry.

29:06.220 --> 29:07.220
He just left.

29:07.220 --> 29:08.220
It's a real angry piggy.

29:08.220 --> 29:09.220
It's a real angry piggy.

29:09.220 --> 29:10.220
Yeah.

29:10.220 --> 29:11.220
Yeah.

29:11.220 --> 29:14.480
You know, when you're getting older, your prostate gets all inflamed when you get all

29:14.480 --> 29:18.120
angry, hopped up on so much fucking.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.120
Yeah.

29:19.120 --> 29:20.920
A false flag bathroom break.

29:20.920 --> 29:21.920
Yeah.

29:21.920 --> 29:22.920
He does actually go to the bathroom.

29:22.920 --> 29:25.440
And while he's out, Taylor is still there.

29:25.440 --> 29:31.120
And he's also on the same script, which is this like bringing some of these Q people

29:31.120 --> 29:33.560
into this fold.

29:33.560 --> 29:35.520
And I know a lot of people that still believe in Q.

29:35.520 --> 29:40.080
I mean, I have a lot of friends, you know, I have family that believe in Q, and now you're

29:40.080 --> 29:41.080
seeing them freak out.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.800
You know, I was on Twitter scrolling through last night because I was wondering the same

29:43.800 --> 29:44.800
thing, you know.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.360
After, I mean, because Trump basically conceded last night.

29:47.360 --> 29:50.320
He told the entire nation that he's going to turn it over to Joe Biden and he's going

29:50.320 --> 29:53.520
to be the president of the United States, which is not the plan.

29:53.520 --> 29:54.840
So these people are freaking out already.

29:54.840 --> 29:58.200
I mean, yeah, some of them probably are kind of being a little bit biased and wanting to

29:58.200 --> 30:00.520
trust the plan still, but that's not going to work.

30:00.520 --> 30:05.260
All it was was a plan to keep us complacent, a plan to not keep us on the streets doing

30:05.260 --> 30:11.200
activism that can actually make a change and a positive impact to help Donald Trump.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.320
You guys went home.

30:13.320 --> 30:15.120
You could have stayed out on the streets.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.320
It's true.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.640
You remember in Portland?

30:17.640 --> 30:18.640
Yeah.

30:18.640 --> 30:19.640
They stayed out on the streets.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.440
Antifa didn't stop them.

30:21.440 --> 30:24.600
But Alex did tell people to respect the curfew.

30:24.600 --> 30:25.600
Yeah.

30:25.600 --> 30:26.600
Yeah.

30:26.600 --> 30:27.600
Yeah.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.600
Yeah.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.360
So I think it was Alex who took them off the streets.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.360
Yeah.

30:31.360 --> 30:32.360
I don't know.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.840
I just, I find this all to be really sad.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.680
Yeah, it is.

30:36.680 --> 30:43.560
Just sad posturing among right-wing scam artists, trying to stake their claim on victims, you

30:43.560 --> 30:46.520
know, just trying to stake their claim on people who they can manipulate.

30:46.520 --> 30:48.240
And it's a bummer.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.280
It's a reshuffling.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.200
It's like the tide came in.

30:51.200 --> 30:55.520
But it's also like, you think about that and it's like, well, it's pretty, it seems pretty

30:55.520 --> 30:59.400
clear to me looking at this, that it's kind of what's going on.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.400
Yeah.

31:00.400 --> 31:04.240
And, and I don't know how you could hear a clip like this and think that any of your

31:04.240 --> 31:08.400
like preferred right-wing media outlets have any integrity.

31:08.400 --> 31:13.760
How big is that, Owen, that Obama says, we've got to shut down the alternative media ecosystem.

31:13.760 --> 31:15.320
They listed Infowars.

31:15.320 --> 31:17.600
They listed Newsmax, who's not even, they're okay.

31:17.600 --> 31:18.940
They listed OAN, who's great.

31:18.940 --> 31:20.720
They listed Gateway Pundit.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.720
I mean, there's not many people out there.

31:22.720 --> 31:25.600
Hey, Drudge used to be a great guy, came to studio, knows what's going on.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.480
Trump wouldn't financially support him or whatever.

31:27.480 --> 31:30.080
He got, let's CNN buy him out, I'm told.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.860
My point is there's not many holdouts out there.

31:32.860 --> 31:39.260
So the entire right-wing media ecosystem was largely driven by Drudge for a very long time.

31:39.260 --> 31:41.920
For the last, since the Clintons.

31:41.920 --> 31:42.920
Basically, yes.

31:42.920 --> 31:43.920
Yeah.

31:43.920 --> 31:45.880
I remember my dad reading Drudge in the nineties.

31:45.880 --> 31:46.880
Yeah.

31:46.880 --> 31:53.000
And it really warped a lot of the media line in shows like Rush and Hannity.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.880
If it weren't for Drudge, we probably wouldn't be in the same situation we're in.

31:56.880 --> 32:02.200
It was a clearing house for the talking points of the right-wing.

32:02.200 --> 32:06.280
And now Alex is suggesting that he doesn't like Trump anymore because Trump wouldn't

32:06.280 --> 32:07.280
pay him off.

32:07.280 --> 32:08.280
Yeah.

32:08.280 --> 32:09.280
What the fuck?

32:09.280 --> 32:10.280
No, you get it?

32:10.280 --> 32:11.280
Yeah.

32:11.280 --> 32:17.200
Because if the president doesn't pay you off for good coverage, then it's your responsibility

32:17.200 --> 32:20.560
as a principled person to sell to CNN.

32:20.560 --> 32:22.880
And that will completely alter your coverage.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.360
No, no, no, no, no, no.

32:24.360 --> 32:30.120
It's all about, look, your integrity never stays... Dan, you know, like if we suddenly

32:30.120 --> 32:36.160
took a shit ton of money from, I don't know, let's say Jeff Bezos, obviously our coverage

32:36.160 --> 32:37.920
wouldn't change.

32:37.920 --> 32:42.400
I'd replace you with an Echo.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.400
I'm Dan.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.400
I'm Alexa.

32:45.400 --> 32:50.840
Dan, we love your show.

32:50.840 --> 32:54.720
We're going to give you $20 million, but that... You know the guy.

32:54.720 --> 32:58.200
You know, the white... I think maybe get rid of him.

32:58.200 --> 32:59.280
Jordan, we're going to replace it.

32:59.280 --> 33:04.220
We're going to transfer his consciousness into Amazon Echo.

33:04.220 --> 33:05.760
That way we can turn him off.

33:05.760 --> 33:06.760
Yeah.

33:06.760 --> 33:07.960
I don't have to say neighbors anymore.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.960
I can turn the volume.

33:09.960 --> 33:10.960
Yes, exactly.

33:10.960 --> 33:17.120
So yeah, I mean, I just... I don't understand how anybody can think that they have any kind

33:17.120 --> 33:22.920
of... Calling it alternative media is laughable when you're like, Matt Drudge didn't get money

33:22.920 --> 33:25.600
from Trump, so he- So he sold to CNN.

33:25.600 --> 33:26.600
Yeah.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.600
That's alternative.

33:27.600 --> 33:28.600
So he turned on him.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.160
Your alternative is the highest bidder?

33:31.160 --> 33:32.160
Yeah.

33:32.160 --> 33:33.160
Yeah.

33:33.160 --> 33:36.760
In this next clip, I just kept in, because they're just like, no fucking way.

33:36.760 --> 33:40.560
Alex takes some calls, and this guy, no way.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.560
No way.

33:41.560 --> 33:42.560
I got you.

33:42.560 --> 33:43.560
I hear you.

33:43.560 --> 33:47.120
And also too, I don't know if these numbers were accurate, but I was watching everything

33:47.120 --> 33:53.400
live on your radio show yesterday, and congratulations, because this showed that you had 1.6 billion

33:53.400 --> 33:54.400
viewers.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.400
And that's amazing.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.780
Congratulations, man.

33:56.780 --> 33:57.780
That just warmed my heart.

33:57.780 --> 33:58.780
I snapshotted it.

33:58.780 --> 33:59.780
1.6 billion.

33:59.780 --> 34:00.780
Hold on.

34:00.780 --> 34:03.240
I'm writing something down.

34:03.240 --> 34:06.400
I need to add exclamation points real quick.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.000
It is... The first word is no.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.160
All right.

34:10.160 --> 34:13.880
Let me add the second exclamation point, and it is way.

34:13.880 --> 34:14.880
No way.

34:14.880 --> 34:15.880
That would be no way.

34:15.880 --> 34:16.880
No way.

34:16.880 --> 34:17.880
No way.

34:17.880 --> 34:18.880
Two exclamation points.

34:18.880 --> 34:19.880
No way.

34:19.880 --> 34:20.880
One for each word.

34:20.880 --> 34:21.880
1.6 billion listeners to Infowars, simultaneous- From where?

34:21.880 --> 34:22.880
From where?

34:22.880 --> 34:23.880
It's just a radio show.

34:23.880 --> 34:24.880
Yeah.

34:24.880 --> 34:25.880
It's not happening.

34:25.880 --> 34:26.880
Okay.

34:26.880 --> 34:37.720
So we end here on this next clip from January 7th, and I got to say, I found this episode

34:37.720 --> 34:39.400
to be largely unlistenable.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.880
I really didn't even think it was a show.

34:41.880 --> 34:46.080
It kind of felt like Alex trying to figure out what the narrative was going to be, and

34:46.080 --> 34:48.080
it's just like, all right, Antifa did this.

34:48.080 --> 34:54.280
They tricked us by instigating, and then they went away, and all the Patriots got really

34:54.280 --> 35:00.040
excited, and they had to fight back because now the police were attacking them.

35:00.040 --> 35:05.180
He's sort of talking through it to get his bearings about it, and it's not an interesting

35:05.180 --> 35:06.180
show at all.

35:06.180 --> 35:07.180
Yeah.

35:07.180 --> 35:09.960
It's a man licking his wounds in the posture of somebody who won.

35:09.960 --> 35:15.440
Well, and trying to figure out what's damage control, what's the angle that we can move

35:15.440 --> 35:16.440
forward with.

35:16.440 --> 35:17.440
Right.

35:17.440 --> 35:18.440
Right.

35:18.440 --> 35:22.760
And at the end of the episode, he's pretty clear that he doesn't really have a problem

35:22.760 --> 35:23.760
with what happened.

35:23.760 --> 35:24.760
Yeah, folks.

35:24.760 --> 35:25.760
America's gone.

35:25.760 --> 35:27.420
We killed all the babies.

35:27.420 --> 35:30.120
We devil worshiped, and God took his support away.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.720
We've got to fight back and take it back, and so I want to say this.

35:32.720 --> 35:36.760
I'm proud of the folks who went to the Capitol, quite frankly, that Capitol is so evil.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.920
People under the Declaration of Independence had a right to absolutely burn to the ground.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.440
I don't support that because I don't think this is my right move.

35:42.440 --> 35:46.680
I want to take it back politically, but the point is, is that we're not the ones burning

35:46.680 --> 35:48.840
down police stations and killing people.

35:48.840 --> 35:50.280
We're responding to that.

35:50.280 --> 35:54.280
They started it, the globalists started it, and we're not ashamed of anything, and Trump

35:54.280 --> 35:59.000
should come out and expose Antifa for triggering the riots and stand up against it.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.720
So that's sort of where we're at.

36:00.720 --> 36:06.760
I think a lot of people would 100% believe Trump if he just said that it was Antifa.

36:06.760 --> 36:07.760
Oh, sure.

36:07.760 --> 36:13.160
I think it would be easy, because remember the address that he gave before the riot?

36:13.160 --> 36:17.880
I mean the storming of the Capitol building of the United States of America, a nuclear

36:17.880 --> 36:18.880
power?

36:18.880 --> 36:19.880
Yeah.

36:19.880 --> 36:23.040
So he said all those things that were like, I bet it's going to be Antifa who's going

36:23.040 --> 36:26.860
to take over the Capitol building in just a short period of time, and so this will prove

36:26.860 --> 36:28.080
him correct.

36:28.080 --> 36:32.420
I mean, there is a rich tradition of people blaming their enemies for things.

36:32.420 --> 36:34.800
It does seem very easy to do.

36:34.800 --> 36:35.800
Yeah.

36:35.800 --> 36:36.800
Yeah.

36:36.800 --> 36:39.320
I think you're, I mean I hate to say that I think you're right, that you probably could

36:39.320 --> 36:40.320
pull it off.

36:40.320 --> 36:41.320
Yeah, that's true.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.000
To a certain audience.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Right.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Right, right, right.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.400
Which would be 80% of Republicans.

36:46.400 --> 36:47.580
At this point.

36:47.580 --> 36:55.440
So Alex, now on the 8th, on Friday, he starts off his show with a bit of a different tone.

36:55.440 --> 36:58.520
I think he's accepted at this point that Trump has conceded.

36:58.520 --> 37:03.320
All right, the Globaliscus Info operatives do not want you to take political action.

37:03.320 --> 37:07.280
They want to freeze you right now, believing everything's fine.

37:07.280 --> 37:13.720
It's not, Trump is not in a secret location in Texas, he is surrounded in the White House.

37:13.720 --> 37:16.080
That is not a CG video.

37:16.080 --> 37:21.820
The president did concede the election yesterday, last night.

37:21.820 --> 37:24.800
So he is up to speed with reality somewhat.

37:24.800 --> 37:25.800
Right, right.

37:25.800 --> 37:30.320
New lines, new text messages from the people who tell him that Trump conceded.

37:30.320 --> 37:35.200
I believe that they're, you know, I don't keep up to date fully on the Q stuff, but

37:35.200 --> 37:39.240
it's my understanding that some people were speculating that it was a deep fake or something

37:39.240 --> 37:40.240
like that.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.240
Sure, sure.

37:41.240 --> 37:42.240
I like that.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.240
The video of Trump conceded.

37:43.240 --> 37:44.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.240
Alex is not into that.

37:45.240 --> 37:50.120
At this point, on the 8th, there were pictures coming out, and a lot of the people who were

37:50.120 --> 37:52.200
there and look very suspicious.

37:52.200 --> 37:53.200
Antifa.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.300
Well, maybe.

37:54.300 --> 37:58.240
But they also seem to be wearing like Oath Keepers shirts, and they kind of look like

37:58.240 --> 37:59.240
a militia.

37:59.240 --> 38:00.240
Oh, yeah.

38:00.240 --> 38:03.560
Who could, who dresses like a militia other than Antifa, Dan?

38:03.560 --> 38:04.560
Right.

38:04.560 --> 38:08.560
So Alex has to now incorporate that into the cover of it.

38:08.560 --> 38:12.800
So Antifa started it, which we've established here on the 7th, and now as we get into the

38:12.800 --> 38:17.520
8th, Alex has to explain why there's also militia people there doing shit.

38:17.520 --> 38:18.520
It's tough to explain.

38:18.520 --> 38:19.520
Oh, it's all Trump's fault.

38:19.520 --> 38:21.480
Oh, he got the big crowd there to do this.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.360
No, he was not even done speaking.

38:23.360 --> 38:26.980
He hadn't even started speaking.

38:26.980 --> 38:27.980
You were there.

38:27.980 --> 38:33.820
Before Antifa dressed up as patriots started attacking with another contingent of older

38:33.820 --> 38:38.080
looking people who I believe will end up being a militia controlled by feds.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.360
And militias are constitutional.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.360
They're not bad.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.880
I'm not saying militias are bad.

38:41.880 --> 38:45.760
I'm saying they lead them, they set them up, and they create false ones.

38:45.760 --> 38:49.160
And looking at the MO, the body language, the gear, the behavior, I believe it'll be

38:49.160 --> 38:51.400
a militia led by feds.

38:51.400 --> 38:54.320
That's my prime analysis, almost always exactly accurate.

38:54.320 --> 38:58.560
That sounds almost exactly like what he was saying about the Boston bombing, sort of like,

38:58.560 --> 39:03.000
oh, I look at the body language on these people, they're like, get the fuck out of here, just

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
making shit up.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.840
Have we heard, how is our boy Stuart Rhodes doing?

39:06.840 --> 39:08.280
Have we heard from him?

39:08.280 --> 39:09.480
Also conspicuous in his absence.

39:09.480 --> 39:10.960
Oh, he's conspicuous in his absence?

39:10.960 --> 39:11.960
Why?

39:11.960 --> 39:12.960
I don't know.

39:12.960 --> 39:13.960
It seems like Alex would want to get him on as an expert.

39:13.960 --> 39:19.320
I mean, he's the Oathkeeper who could say more than anyone else, those guys are not

39:19.320 --> 39:20.320
Oathkeepers.

39:20.320 --> 39:23.480
Yeah, yeah, you could give a full throated defense of his organization.

39:23.480 --> 39:26.280
Must be Antifa, Oathkeepers are peaceful.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.320
He seems to maybe not be answering Alex's calls.

39:29.320 --> 39:30.320
Oh, that's weird.

39:30.320 --> 39:35.200
There seems to be a limited guest pool that has led Alex to interviewing the Q shaman.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.560
Yeah, that would get you to where you are.

39:37.560 --> 39:38.560
On this episode.

39:38.560 --> 39:39.560
Yeah.

39:39.560 --> 39:46.840
Alex is really mad at Q stuff on this episode, but he's, again, very much not wanting to

39:46.840 --> 39:49.280
alienate the Q people.

39:49.280 --> 39:55.520
You can still redeem yourself basically, but also Q made this happen, this whole fucking

39:55.520 --> 39:56.520
thing.

39:56.520 --> 39:57.520
Sure.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.520
But it's Antifa.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.520
Well, yes, but Antifa wouldn't have been able to pull it off if it weren't for the dumb

40:01.520 --> 40:03.400
Q people who stormed the building.

40:03.400 --> 40:06.040
I want to learn ninjutsu.

40:06.040 --> 40:07.960
But there was another ingredient that allowed this to happen.

40:07.960 --> 40:12.160
It wasn't just the Antifa.

40:12.160 --> 40:17.040
It wasn't just the sheep dipped militia.

40:17.040 --> 40:20.200
It was the Q.

40:20.200 --> 40:24.700
The Air Force veteran, a wonderful woman, Mrs. Babbitt, loved her country, believed

40:24.700 --> 40:29.760
she was storming it under Q orders of the president.

40:29.760 --> 40:35.520
And so it was the Q people right behind Antifa that did this.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.640
And that is the facts, it doesn't mean if you like the Q stuff, you're bad.

40:38.640 --> 40:44.880
It doesn't mean that anything esoteric like, oh, drive your dump truck to the Hoover Dam,

40:44.880 --> 40:47.080
drive your train off the thing into the ship.

40:47.080 --> 40:53.320
Hillary secretly in Gitmo, Trump's invincible, Pence is on our side, Attorney General Barr

40:53.320 --> 40:54.320
is on our side.

40:54.320 --> 40:55.320
Everything's wonderful.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.320
Go to sleep.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.320
Trump's invincible.

40:57.320 --> 40:58.320
Don't worry about voting.

40:58.320 --> 40:59.800
And now you see it.

40:59.800 --> 41:01.840
So there you go.

41:01.840 --> 41:07.220
Kind of saying Trump is invincible, literally, I don't think any of those things are things

41:07.220 --> 41:08.560
that Alex hasn't said.

41:08.560 --> 41:09.560
Pence is on our side.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.920
That's been a narrative on Infowars for some time.

41:11.920 --> 41:17.480
Bill Barr would go back and forth, Alex would turn him villain and hero pretty regularly.

41:17.480 --> 41:19.480
That was hot and cold.

41:19.480 --> 41:20.480
All over the place.

41:20.480 --> 41:24.400
That was an intense relationship, yeah.

41:24.400 --> 41:29.760
I don't think you should be allowed to say that wonderful woman if I know, and you know

41:29.760 --> 41:33.800
in your heart that if you and your son and Gavin McGinnis were around, you'd be like,

41:33.800 --> 41:35.960
I know she's dead, but she's got great tits.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.560
So you don't get to say that.

41:37.560 --> 41:38.560
That's what I feel like.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.600
That's just me.

41:40.600 --> 41:41.600
That's fair.

41:41.600 --> 41:49.640
So Alex has a source in the media about the fact that Antifa infiltrated the rally.

41:49.640 --> 41:52.960
And it comes from the old New York Post.

41:52.960 --> 42:01.600
Bo Brooks and Gaetz, and said they were briefed that Antifa was planning to pose as patriots

42:01.600 --> 42:02.600
and do it.

42:02.600 --> 42:04.000
That's what Matt Gaetz gets into as well.

42:04.000 --> 42:12.320
Well, now we have the New York Post, we can put it on screen, saying two people were arrested.

42:12.320 --> 42:17.440
They've confirmed we're posing as Make America Great Again people with Make America Great

42:17.440 --> 42:18.480
Again hats.

42:18.480 --> 42:23.420
So the headline of this isn't about them being arrested, it says, quote, two known Antifa

42:23.420 --> 42:27.840
members posed as pro-Trump to infiltrate Capitol riot sources.

42:27.840 --> 42:30.720
So it's a claim from sources.

42:30.720 --> 42:33.880
And it's awesome, too, like if you just get to the fourth paragraph of the story, you

42:33.880 --> 42:34.880
find this.

42:34.880 --> 42:38.520
Quote, a Washington Times report initially claimed two other protesters were actually

42:38.520 --> 42:42.860
Philadelphia-based Antifa members, citing a retired military officer with access to

42:42.860 --> 42:44.860
facial recognition software.

42:44.860 --> 42:48.400
But the outlet deleted the article after the software company told BuzzFeed News that the

42:48.400 --> 42:50.440
story was outright false.

42:50.440 --> 42:51.440
Huh.

42:51.440 --> 42:52.440
Huh.

42:52.440 --> 42:56.240
Yeah, so it's kind of an article that has a nice headline for Alex, but it actually

42:56.240 --> 42:57.240
means nothing.

42:57.240 --> 42:58.240
Wow.

42:58.240 --> 43:02.680
Yeah, and he goes on and on about that, how like two people were arrested that are known

43:02.680 --> 43:05.920
Antifa based on this New York Post story, and I don't know.

43:05.920 --> 43:12.160
I think I hate this just so much because you can see the conversation that happened.

43:12.160 --> 43:16.040
Like you can read that and go, oh, okay, here's what happened.

43:16.040 --> 43:21.000
Somebody went to somebody higher up who was like, oh shit, they did it.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
What do we do?

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
What do we do?

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Oh, just put, it was Antifa.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
That's it.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Like they didn't think about it.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.320
They didn't come up with some brilliant plan.

43:28.320 --> 43:32.880
They were just like, just say Antifa did it and we'll wait and see what happens.

43:32.880 --> 43:33.880
And it's disappointing.

43:33.880 --> 43:34.880
Probably.

43:34.880 --> 43:35.880
Yeah.

43:35.880 --> 43:37.960
So we continue down the road.

43:37.960 --> 43:42.800
One of the things that is stuck from the seventh into the eighth is that Trump only conceded

43:42.800 --> 43:52.260
because he had a metaphorical gun to his head Pence threatened the 25th amendment removal

43:52.260 --> 44:02.980
of Trump yesterday morning and afternoon and said, if you don't go take a message, decrying

44:02.980 --> 44:08.680
your supporters and decrying the whole thing and saying you'll allow a peaceful transition

44:08.680 --> 44:14.480
of power to Joe Biden, which he'd already put out as a, as a tweet that morning, we

44:14.480 --> 44:15.680
are going to remove you.

44:15.680 --> 44:19.640
We have the cabinet votes right now to remove you under the 25th amendment.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.980
They were just looking for the excuse only for the pretext.

44:21.980 --> 44:25.720
So this is the way that you get around the fact that Trump was yelling about how like,

44:25.720 --> 44:31.340
uh, you know, I'm never going to back down and he's like, all right, yeah, because otherwise

44:31.340 --> 44:34.960
you kind of gotta be like, oh, he was just full of shit.

44:34.960 --> 44:42.480
And also it would be a really difficult thing to justify that like, why was, why if he does

44:42.480 --> 44:47.640
have evidence that this was a false and fraudulent election, why would he ever back down?

44:47.640 --> 44:49.200
Now he is backing down.

44:49.200 --> 44:54.120
That would seem to imply that either he was lying or he's the sort of person who would

44:54.120 --> 44:56.000
allow a fraudulent election to stand.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
It does seem like that.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
And that's tough.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.640
And the only way around that is, Hey man, Pence, he had a metaphorical gun to his head

45:01.640 --> 45:04.000
that had a label that said 25th amendment.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
Yeah.

45:05.000 --> 45:09.520
But Pence's metaphorical gun only happened because you held a literal gun to him.

45:09.520 --> 45:12.360
You know, they're not going to wrestle with this.

45:12.360 --> 45:18.080
That's the, I just, I just, it's so frustrating because if like an eco terrorist blew up the

45:18.080 --> 45:23.920
Capitol building and killed a bunch of people, I wouldn't be like, Hey, listen, we got a

45:23.920 --> 45:25.940
like, no, goodbye.

45:25.940 --> 45:27.120
You don't get to do that.

45:27.120 --> 45:28.120
No.

45:28.120 --> 45:29.120
Yeah.

45:29.120 --> 45:30.120
I love the climate too, man.

45:30.120 --> 45:31.120
But no.

45:31.120 --> 45:32.120
Yeah.

45:32.120 --> 45:33.120
It's not hard.

45:33.120 --> 45:34.880
It doesn't seem like it should be.

45:34.880 --> 45:39.440
But at the same time, you don't make a lot of money scamming people around the ideas

45:39.440 --> 45:40.440
of climate change.

45:40.440 --> 45:41.440
God.

45:41.440 --> 45:42.440
I should.

45:42.440 --> 45:43.440
Yeah.

45:43.440 --> 45:44.440
That's the, that's the thing.

45:44.440 --> 45:49.680
Alex has a house of cards that he's built, uh, that it can get knocked over, uh, that

45:49.680 --> 45:50.680
he has to protect.

45:50.680 --> 45:51.680
Yeah.

45:51.680 --> 45:52.680
Is Sean King busy?

45:52.680 --> 45:55.640
I could probably work for him scaring people about, uh, yeah.

45:55.640 --> 46:02.720
So Alex, uh, was there at the Capitol building for a time on the sixth provably.

46:02.720 --> 46:03.720
Yes he was.

46:03.720 --> 46:09.000
And a lot of people were reporting that he was trying to incite a riot.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.480
Um, and it was my sense from watching the entirety of info wars over the course of the

46:14.480 --> 46:15.480
day.

46:15.480 --> 46:19.380
I, what I expressed on our last episode is exactly what I feel.

46:19.380 --> 46:24.920
He was definitely saying things that look really bad in hindsight, but once shit popped

46:24.920 --> 46:31.480
off real seriously, I didn't see him inciting people outside of him doing a inciting radio

46:31.480 --> 46:33.960
show, which is what he does all the fucking time.

46:33.960 --> 46:38.480
In terms of what he actually did at the Capitol, there wasn't a lot of evidence of that on

46:38.480 --> 46:40.040
the show itself.

46:40.040 --> 46:45.360
But Alex does have video of himself and he is trying to talk the crowd down.

46:45.360 --> 46:51.360
If this video is to be believed as like a full representation of his actions, he seems

46:51.360 --> 46:56.660
very much like, hey everybody, we have a permit to be over there.

46:56.660 --> 46:58.400
Everybody go over there.

46:58.400 --> 47:03.480
And I think like, I mean, look, dude sucks, but that's probably the best you could do

47:03.480 --> 47:04.680
in that circumstance.

47:04.680 --> 47:05.680
Sure.

47:05.680 --> 47:07.680
And so he plays a little bit of that on the show.

47:07.680 --> 47:14.680
Listen to me, listen to me, we've got a permit on the other side, it's great that this happened,

47:14.680 --> 47:17.680
but the Trump's not going to come when we've taken this over.

47:17.680 --> 47:22.680
We're not ampersand, we're not BRO, you're amazing, I love you.

47:22.680 --> 47:25.680
Let's march around to the other side.

47:25.680 --> 47:30.680
Let's not fight the police and get the system to run.

47:30.680 --> 47:32.680
We are peaceful.

47:32.680 --> 47:34.680
We won this election.

47:34.680 --> 47:43.680
And as much as I love seeing the Trump flags flying over, if we need to not have the confrontation

47:43.680 --> 47:46.680
with the police, they're going to make that the story.

47:46.680 --> 47:52.680
I'm going to march to the other side where we have a stage where we can speak and occupy

47:52.680 --> 47:53.680
peacefully.

47:53.680 --> 48:01.680
Tell everybody behind you, march to the other side, march to the other side.

48:01.680 --> 48:06.680
Alex has the instinct to know in the moment that like, if this gets too much further out

48:06.680 --> 48:08.680
of hand, we're fucked.

48:08.680 --> 48:09.680
Yeah.

48:09.680 --> 48:15.680
This is going to be something that is going, they will take the problem of right wing extremism

48:15.680 --> 48:18.680
far too seriously if this goes any farther.

48:18.680 --> 48:20.680
So I have to do my part to deescalate.

48:20.680 --> 48:21.680
Right.

48:21.680 --> 48:22.680
And it makes sense.

48:22.680 --> 48:23.680
It's in his character.

48:23.680 --> 48:24.680
It's exactly what you would do.

48:24.680 --> 48:26.680
No, it's the gate of gates all over again.

48:26.680 --> 48:28.680
She got out of pocket.

48:28.680 --> 48:30.680
Look, I don't get into that kind of deep source stuff.

48:30.680 --> 48:31.680
That's dangerous.

48:31.680 --> 48:36.680
Now, obviously I've incited that, said that, insisted that I do that.

48:36.680 --> 48:41.680
And because I'm so proud of doing that, I've almost certainly inspired other people to

48:41.680 --> 48:42.680
do that.

48:42.680 --> 48:43.680
But that's not my fault.

48:43.680 --> 48:44.680
No.

48:44.680 --> 48:47.680
This is his attempt to come back from the edge, as it were.

48:47.680 --> 48:51.680
He's gotten things this far and you want it to come back or else you're in trouble.

48:51.680 --> 48:54.680
This mob is all independent contractors.

48:54.680 --> 48:57.680
I don't, they don't work for info.

48:57.680 --> 49:01.680
So, like I said, I mean, the sense that I get is he just knows this is too much.

49:01.680 --> 49:03.680
This is dangerous.

49:03.680 --> 49:22.680
No, no, no, no.

49:22.680 --> 49:47.680
No, no, no, no, no.

49:47.680 --> 49:59.680
No, no, no.

49:59.680 --> 50:02.680
I mean, that's, that is pretty remarkable.

50:02.680 --> 50:07.680
This is the snapshot of what happens when exactly what you've been trying to get to

50:07.680 --> 50:08.680
happen happens.

50:08.680 --> 50:10.680
And you know that you never wanted that to happen.

50:10.680 --> 50:14.680
You wanted to live in that in-between state where you can profit off the tension.

50:14.680 --> 50:15.680
Yeah.

50:15.680 --> 50:16.680
This sex is supposed to be tantric.

50:16.680 --> 50:18.680
You're not supposed to come all over the Capitol building.

50:18.680 --> 50:19.680
Yeah, yeah.

50:19.680 --> 50:23.680
And what happens is you get on your radio show and you make a lot of money exciting

50:23.680 --> 50:28.680
people yelling, we're going to storm the state houses, you know, all this shit forever.

50:28.680 --> 50:29.680
Yeah.

50:29.680 --> 50:32.680
And then once you're there and it's happening, you get on a bullhorn and you yell, get off

50:32.680 --> 50:33.680
the building.

50:33.680 --> 50:34.680
Yeah.

50:34.680 --> 50:35.680
That's how it goes.

50:35.680 --> 50:36.680
Yeah.

50:36.680 --> 50:37.680
Yeah.

50:37.680 --> 50:38.680
We want to do this politically.

50:38.680 --> 50:39.680
No one knows what that means.

50:39.680 --> 50:40.680
You don't even know what that means.

50:40.680 --> 50:47.680
I swear to God, if I am a person who is in the middle of trying to storm a Capitol building

50:47.680 --> 50:53.680
and some asshole just starts screaming USA and I just like instinctively start chanting

50:53.680 --> 50:55.680
with, kill me, just kill me.

50:55.680 --> 50:56.680
I don't want to be that person.

50:56.680 --> 51:01.680
What if you're climbing on the Capitol building and then you hear the Texan get on the bullhorn

51:01.680 --> 51:02.680
and say, get off the building.

51:02.680 --> 51:03.680
You're getting off the building.

51:03.680 --> 51:04.680
I'm not getting off that building.

51:04.680 --> 51:05.680
I'm already up there.

51:05.680 --> 51:06.680
Yeah, probably not.

51:06.680 --> 51:07.680
You're on a bullhorn.

51:07.680 --> 51:08.680
You can't tear me down.

51:08.680 --> 51:09.680
I don't see it being an effective.

51:09.680 --> 51:10.680
I'm not going to pass that.

51:10.680 --> 51:16.280
But if I'm on my way to the building, maybe, and I just sit up to chant USA, I guess I

51:16.280 --> 51:18.360
think I might be a follower, Dan.

51:18.360 --> 51:21.280
I think I might not be the tip of the spear I thought I was.

51:21.280 --> 51:25.920
So Alex has a path to victory that he wants to explain to his audience, but he can't quite

51:25.920 --> 51:27.280
yet.

51:27.280 --> 51:33.680
You know, I need to do a presentation in here and I'm still working on getting the components

51:33.680 --> 51:34.680
I need.

51:34.680 --> 51:35.680
So I'm gonna go to rebroadcast for a while.

51:35.680 --> 51:36.680
It's no problem.

51:36.680 --> 51:40.040
And then once I get those components, I'm going to come in here and I'm gonna lay out

51:40.040 --> 51:41.240
the path to victory.

51:41.240 --> 51:42.680
So he doesn't end up...

51:42.680 --> 51:43.680
Maybe.

51:43.680 --> 51:45.000
I don't think he does do this.

51:45.000 --> 51:49.040
I didn't hear a path to victory other than blame Antifa.

51:49.040 --> 51:53.160
Well, Dan, the path to victory is a narrow path.

51:53.160 --> 51:54.160
Certainly.

51:54.160 --> 51:57.080
The very few can walk the path to heaven?

51:57.080 --> 51:58.080
Sure.

51:58.080 --> 51:59.080
Sure.

51:59.080 --> 52:03.920
During one of the breaks, it appears that Alex either did or is claiming to have talked

52:03.920 --> 52:07.160
to Mike Flynn, and he had some news about Trump.

52:07.160 --> 52:13.280
We are witnessing Satan's full attack, and I have been on the phone with the Flins.

52:13.280 --> 52:15.920
I have been on the phone with many others.

52:15.920 --> 52:16.920
You went home.

52:16.920 --> 52:25.000
Trump is basically in a shell, he is surrounded, and he is basically turning on his supporters

52:25.000 --> 52:29.640
and has been told that he will be 25th Amendment if he basically says or does anything now.

52:29.640 --> 52:33.240
So the president of the United States is captured.

52:33.240 --> 52:36.880
He was buffaloed, he was shanghaied, he was bamboozled.

52:36.880 --> 52:42.120
This is a good way to jettison Trump, the person from...

52:42.120 --> 52:44.040
You don't need him anymore, really.

52:44.040 --> 52:45.760
He has no real use.

52:45.760 --> 52:48.760
You've already seen him humiliated, basically.

52:48.760 --> 52:53.920
You've seen him turn tail whenever things got too close to what you want him to support.

52:53.920 --> 52:56.720
Which is so surprising, yeah.

52:56.720 --> 53:03.840
You've seen him bend to the whims of the people who are saying, like, you're going to lose

53:03.840 --> 53:05.520
this election because you lost.

53:05.520 --> 53:06.520
You're going to leave office.

53:06.520 --> 53:07.840
I'll leave office.

53:07.840 --> 53:09.960
Here's what's going to happen.

53:09.960 --> 53:11.560
He's not the strong man anymore.

53:11.560 --> 53:15.640
Next week, we are going to find out, and Dan, this is going to blow your mind.

53:15.640 --> 53:17.560
Did you know that Trump had mob ties?

53:17.560 --> 53:18.560
Whoa.

53:18.560 --> 53:19.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:19.560 --> 53:20.560
We're going to find out.

53:20.560 --> 53:26.280
I guarantee you that Alex is going to suddenly discover this fact that he absolutely never

53:26.280 --> 53:27.280
knew before.

53:27.280 --> 53:28.280
Yeah, yeah.

53:28.280 --> 53:29.280
Yeah.

53:29.280 --> 53:30.280
Five years later.

53:30.280 --> 53:31.280
Wild.

53:31.280 --> 53:32.280
Wild how...

53:32.280 --> 53:33.520
Did you know that Trump was connected to a lot of mob people?

53:33.520 --> 53:35.980
I would even argue that that's maybe your way out.

53:35.980 --> 53:36.980
Did you know that he's...

53:36.980 --> 53:39.360
Say it was the mob who stopped the Patriots.

53:39.360 --> 53:42.280
Did you know that he was a front man for consortiums on the East Coast?

53:42.280 --> 53:43.280
I did not!

53:43.280 --> 53:44.280
Yeah.

53:44.280 --> 53:48.280
Did you know that with a name like Corleone, you get arrested, but with Trump, you don't?

53:48.280 --> 53:53.540
You know, it's almost like somebody who is already enthralled to medium powers would

53:53.540 --> 53:56.480
very easily be swayed by superpowers.

53:56.480 --> 53:57.480
Probably.

53:57.480 --> 53:58.480
Strange.

53:58.480 --> 54:05.000
So there were, like I said, some deaths at the rally, and, not rally, storming of the

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Capitol.

54:07.000 --> 54:13.720
And there were a couple of medical-related ones, and there were also a couple of officers.

54:13.720 --> 54:15.440
There were a couple of cops.

54:15.440 --> 54:16.440
Right.

54:16.440 --> 54:20.000
So I assume since Antifa was there, those people went to the Antifa medical tents that

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
were set up at every protest that...

54:23.000 --> 54:26.220
Well, they went to the free kitchen.

54:26.220 --> 54:27.220
The free...

54:27.220 --> 54:28.220
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:28.220 --> 54:29.220
That's a great place.

54:29.220 --> 54:30.220
Yeah.

54:30.220 --> 54:31.220
No.

54:31.220 --> 54:32.400
Alex is gonna lie about these cops.

54:32.400 --> 54:35.860
You had a million people in D.C. conservatively that came there.

54:35.860 --> 54:39.280
You had hundreds of thousands, 300, 400,000 of the Capitol surrounding the whole thing.

54:39.280 --> 54:40.280
Never seen anything like it.

54:40.280 --> 54:44.560
And a couple of hundred went in, the police opened the gates, they were downsized that

54:44.560 --> 54:50.160
day, they were commanded to do it, and then four Patriots got killed, and one police officer

54:50.160 --> 54:51.740
had a stroke and died.

54:51.740 --> 54:55.040
So there were actually two cops at the Capitol who are now dead.

54:55.040 --> 54:58.560
One was Howard Liebengood, who passed away on Saturday, and at this point there's some

54:58.560 --> 55:02.200
reporting that's calling this an apparent suicide, which is very sad.

55:02.200 --> 55:05.780
The other is Brian Sicknick, who was assaulted by Trump rioters.

55:05.780 --> 55:07.320
Neither of these men died from a stroke.

55:07.320 --> 55:10.960
Alex is making that up to try and deflect from the human toll of his side's actions,

55:10.960 --> 55:14.320
which he can't acknowledge without kind of ruining this game that he's trying to play.

55:14.320 --> 55:15.320
Yeah.

55:15.320 --> 55:16.320
It's very sad.

55:16.320 --> 55:17.320
It's very sad.

55:17.320 --> 55:22.760
It's so obvious, this whole back of the blue nonsense, and we support the police, it's

55:22.760 --> 55:23.760
all cover.

55:23.760 --> 55:26.760
We just want to kill the left, can't you just let us kill them?

55:26.760 --> 55:28.400
Yeah, it's meaningless.

55:28.400 --> 55:31.840
We want to kill Nancy Pelosi, let us kill her!

55:31.840 --> 55:36.000
So there were only a few hundred people who went into the Capitol building, it's not that

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
big a deal.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
Sure.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
Just a couple hundred.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
Wait, what?

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
No, no, no, no, no, no!

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
It's just a couple hundred people.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
No!

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
It's not a big deal.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
No!

55:45.000 --> 55:47.640
It's just a couple hundred.

55:47.640 --> 55:49.040
And who were the few hundred?

55:49.040 --> 55:55.520
Almost all of them were in bearskins and weird outfits, and Danny Crockett-type deals, and

55:55.520 --> 55:58.840
they had two shirts on saying, I am too, master!

55:58.840 --> 55:59.840
Guns.

55:59.840 --> 56:02.520
We got one of these guys coming on, I don't think he's a bad guy, I think he got stuck

56:02.520 --> 56:06.200
right into it, and I get the doors are open, he's a journalist, go cover it.

56:06.200 --> 56:11.640
But most of them weren't looting, some people joked around, I wouldn't go in their offices,

56:11.640 --> 56:14.880
I wouldn't dig through people's mail, that's a federal offense, I don't want my house broke

56:14.880 --> 56:18.440
into, or my office broken into.

56:18.440 --> 56:21.280
So there was criminal activity, but they've gone to Josh Hawley's house, they've gone

56:21.280 --> 56:24.720
to everybody's house, they've come to my house, they've come to Tucker Carlson's house, and

56:24.720 --> 56:28.720
they come and they threaten people and they engage in this.

56:28.720 --> 56:33.280
So ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to get prepared and ready, I don't know how long

56:33.280 --> 56:36.240
we'll even be here in this climate, we've got storeable food ready to ship right now

56:36.240 --> 56:40.880
at PrepareWithAlex.com, for the biggest, best company out there.

56:40.880 --> 56:41.880
Pretty smooth.

56:41.880 --> 56:42.880
Yeah.

56:42.880 --> 56:49.440
Nice, nice ad, nice ad transition.

56:49.440 --> 56:52.640
I think these people might be a little flustered.

56:52.640 --> 56:58.320
I think, you know what, I'm getting a feeling that the far right is trapped in this place

56:58.320 --> 57:04.520
where they're like, God, we want to kill everybody, and what happened, we want to do again.

57:04.520 --> 57:05.520
Yeah.

57:05.520 --> 57:08.960
But we can't do it again if we say we did it the first time.

57:08.960 --> 57:09.960
It was Antifa.

57:09.960 --> 57:11.120
It was Antifa.

57:11.120 --> 57:12.440
Next time's gonna be Antifa 2, by the way.

57:12.440 --> 57:17.960
But I also have to tell people to do it another time, while at the same time telling people

57:17.960 --> 57:22.680
not in advance that it will be Antifa who does the thing that they do again.

57:22.680 --> 57:28.520
And Trump will be president for a second term, even though he conceded, but you know, he

57:28.520 --> 57:32.760
didn't really, he had a metaphorical gun to his head, and if he did concede...

57:32.760 --> 57:34.920
We can put literal guns to everybody else's head.

57:34.920 --> 57:40.360
You should have heard the demonic cackling that came out of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

57:40.360 --> 57:41.360
Okay, okay.

57:41.360 --> 57:45.400
As soon as he said, I'm sorry, I'm conceding.

57:45.400 --> 57:49.240
You saw Harris, and then it looked totally freaked out and criminal, and you saw Biden

57:49.240 --> 58:03.240
now at the podium just, Harris is like, Jesus, you were so mean to our BLM people, you abused

58:03.240 --> 58:05.040
them so badly in our Antifa.

58:05.040 --> 58:06.040
Yeah.

58:06.040 --> 58:11.480
Oh, we've seen what terrorists, we're gonna arrest all of you, finally, America's mine.

58:11.480 --> 58:14.600
It's like a little mermaid when she sells her soul or voice.

58:14.600 --> 58:19.800
And Melissa says, I got you, now you're a slave in the pen.

58:19.800 --> 58:23.200
Finally, under the pedophile king's control.

58:23.200 --> 58:26.040
Ursula was the villain in Little Mermaid.

58:26.040 --> 58:33.040
No, as we know, Alex prefers the bad guys in every movie.

58:33.040 --> 58:34.280
Maleficent was in Sleeping Beauty.

58:34.280 --> 58:35.280
Yes.

58:35.280 --> 58:36.280
And he's got him a little mixed up.

58:36.280 --> 58:37.280
That's an issue.

58:37.280 --> 58:38.280
Yeah.

58:38.280 --> 58:39.280
Yeah.

58:39.280 --> 58:42.800
Anyway, look, dude, there's only a couple hundred people under the Capitol.

58:42.800 --> 58:44.160
And also, look, dude, I-

58:44.160 --> 58:45.160
I am-

58:45.160 --> 58:46.160
Shush.

58:46.160 --> 58:47.160
... boggled.

58:47.160 --> 58:48.160
Shush.

58:48.160 --> 58:49.160
That's a beauty.

58:49.160 --> 58:50.160
That's a beauty.

58:50.160 --> 58:51.160
You think that's a beauty?

58:51.160 --> 58:52.160
It's a beaut.

58:52.160 --> 58:53.160
You think that?

58:53.160 --> 58:54.160
Ah, come on.

58:54.160 --> 58:55.160
It was a few hundred people in the Capitol building.

58:55.160 --> 58:57.320
If you think that's impressive, wait for this.

58:57.320 --> 58:58.840
They didn't even really wanna go in.

58:58.840 --> 59:05.760
The Capitol Police stood down, they were then ordered to let the crowds in that didn't even

59:05.760 --> 59:11.240
want in because I guess they needed to cover up the hundred Antifa and the other 50 or

59:11.240 --> 59:13.440
so orange hat guys that let in and did this.

59:13.440 --> 59:15.920
And it's them breaking the windows out doing it all.

59:15.920 --> 59:21.480
Yeah, man, the police were told to bring in these people who didn't even really wanna

59:21.480 --> 59:27.120
come in because they had to cover for Antifa and the orange hat people who are almost certainly

59:27.120 --> 59:28.520
Proud Boy related.

59:28.520 --> 59:29.520
Yeah.

59:29.520 --> 59:33.440
Dan, this is going to require a lot of- like there's gonna be- to find a solution and a

59:33.440 --> 59:39.680
way out of this problem, which is to say that the right wing is all terrorists.

59:39.680 --> 59:44.600
It's gonna require a lot of diplomacy, it's gonna require a lot of compromise and thought

59:44.600 --> 59:46.280
and some concession.

59:46.280 --> 59:48.040
That's gonna- that's just gonna be true.

59:48.040 --> 59:53.080
Now, on the other hand, I have watched a lot of superhero movies and they solve things

59:53.080 --> 59:54.080
by punching-

59:54.080 --> 59:55.080
Ninjutsu.

59:55.080 --> 59:56.080
Ninjutsu.

59:56.080 --> 59:59.200
I'm not saying one way is faster than the other.

59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.040
I'm just saying Ninjutsu.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.040
So we only had a couple hundred people in there, right?

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.040
Whatever.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.040
I can't hear you say that without stopping.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.000
They didn't really even wanna go anywhere near the building.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.320
No, I can't hear you say that part.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.320
Right.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:16.920
But also there's, you know, like, look, they were probably hired gurus.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.000
I was there, our listeners saw it.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.040
Our listeners are like hardcore veterans and then retired cops and steel workers-

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.160
Oh yeah, they were there too.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.520
We saw these skinny jean guys go attack the cops, they finally got the cops to fight back.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.520
Then these other guys came in as reinforcement.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:35.400
These weren't skinny jean guys, they hired some tough guys.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:40.360
So these skinny jean guys are the Antifa guys and they hired a group of goons who are much

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.840
stronger than them because they're not strong.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:47.760
And so they hired stronger people as backup to fight against the police or something.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.280
It seems like this would be a job that almost nobody would take.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.560
In a certain sense, wouldn't that mean that anti-fascists were hiring fascists to do their

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.760
dirty work for them?

01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.400
It would imply that.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.400
Okay.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.400
Alright.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.960
Because you would have to be like, if you are that group of, I don't know, bikers,

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:06.960
let's say.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:07.960
Yeah, whatever you want.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:08.960
Pick anything.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:13.040
You would have to be willing to take a certain amount of money in order to almost certainly

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.200
go on a death mission.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.200
Yes, that is correct.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.480
Because you would have to assume you're going to get killed for trying to-

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:22.160
You're in the Capitol building of the United States of America, a nuclear power.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.160
Right.

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.600
And you're just doing it as a job.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.600
Yeah.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.600
What?

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.600
What, five grand?

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.600
No, I don't even get five grand.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.600
I'll do it for 25.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.600
Okay.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.600
I'll take two.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.400
What kind of gone in 60 seconds kind of nonsense is this?

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.400
It's the perfect crime.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:41.360
They have all of the family members of this biker gang kidnapped.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.360
I don't know.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:47.360
What I would just expect asking me to accept is a little bit too much.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.420
It's a little bit sad.

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.080
Not for my family, Dan.

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.640
They'll buy any old shit.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.000
So we do get one person who answered Alex's call.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.080
No Steve Pechenik, no Stuart Rhodes, no Roger Stone.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.080
Sure.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.560
Those people seem really important to this moment though.

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:04.560
Oh, very.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.140
I want to hear CBP's take on this.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:10.760
Someone who's less important though, and maybe that's why he can appear, there's not a lot

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.240
of heat on him, is Joel Skousen.

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.720
He's somebody who can just come and go as he pleases.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:17.720
Yes.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:24.920
He's notably been somebody who's been harshly critical of Trump, which is why his power

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.800
placement in Info Wars world has dropped a bit over the last few years.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.680
But now we might be seeing it elevate again.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:35.080
And he's anti-communist royalty based on his relation to W. Cleon Skousen.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:39.960
And so he shows up and of course everything's a fucking false flag to this guy.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.960
Sure.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:46.680
So of course Antifa did it and what have you, but he has proof.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:53.040
Well, Joel Skousen does, and he might've got this from another fellow we know named Lionel.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:57.040
Well the telltale case is every one of these people had backpacks and in those backpacks

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:01.200
were gas masks, weapons, mace, or other smoke bombs or other things.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:05.480
Look, Trump supporters don't bring those types of things to a rally.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.480
They had backpacks.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.480
That's proof.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:11.000
Trump supporters don't have backpacks.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.960
And they don't bring that kind of stuff to rallies.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.160
That's exclusive to the left.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:17.160
This isn't fair.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.160
No.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.160
This isn't fair.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.160
No, it's very dumb.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.160
This isn't fun.

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.160
I don't like it.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.160
They're mean.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.160
It's pretty dumb.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.520
But this next clip is absolutely mean.

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:30.120
So Skousen is saying that like, look, there's going to be something really big happening.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.880
There's going to be a false flag coming that's really big.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.540
And Alex suggests, well, it's the Q stuff.

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:38.920
The Q stuff is the false flag that's coming.

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.960
Then Skousen throws Lin Wood under the bus.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.240
Hell yeah, throw Lin Wood under the bus.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.420
He's already under the bus.

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.920
He's getting crunchy under that bus.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:51.640
Now I would suggest that the things that Skousen takes issue with are very similar to a lot

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.040
of the things Alex says.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.720
How do you demonize a populist movement?

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.720
That's their goal.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.720
They admit it.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:03:59.720
Yeah, that's right.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.620
You do it by these false flag attacks.

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:05.240
And I'm just trying to portray that it's going to be more than a truck bomb.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.320
It's going to be more than Oklahoma-Siboney bombing.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.720
That's been done before.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:14.260
I think they're going to try to gin up some large mass revolutionary movements that in

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:19.000
fact are going to be driven by agent provocateurs, not just anti-B.L.F.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.960
That's going to be whoever these feds are, these globalists in Q, because they're already

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.880
saying Trump's secretly in Texas.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.980
He's about to order you to launch your military attacks.

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:29.440
That is so damn obvious.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.440
That's right.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:35.440
And unfortunately, Lin Wood, Sidney Powell, they're listening to Q. Lin Wood published

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:41.480
this rumor about the deep state is going to kill Donald Trump and all of his supporters.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:42.480
I mean, that's just bullshit.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.480
Stay there, Joe Skousen.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.480
Never heard Joe Skousen say BS.

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.480
That's where we're at, folks.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.480
I'd give a little cut there.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.480
Yeah.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.080
Yeah, Lin Wood saying that the deep state is going to kill Trump and his supporters

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.280
is such bullshit.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.280
Such bullshit.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:00.400
You're saying that to a guy who's said that a hundred times over the last couple months.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.240
And in waves, too.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.720
Not in like a, oh, I'm repeating the same story.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.120
No, no, no, no, sir.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:11.160
There are no reasons that the deep state will be killing Trump very shortly.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.800
And for quite a while, too, because-

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:13.800
For a long time.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.200
You know, there have been Diet Coke poisonings.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.080
From before he was even inaugurated, they were like, oh, they're going to kill Trump

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.080
on day one.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.080
They did everything.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.320
Alex said they were going to nuke the inauguration.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.320
Of course.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.320
Yeah.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.320
Did they do that?

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:28.320
They're going to fly a helicopter into the podium.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.320
Oh, man.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.320
Jesus.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.320
Yeah.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:34.160
So, I mean, if Skousen wants to say that Lin Wood's doing his bullshit, then he should

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.360
consider the bookings that he accepts.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.360
Yeah.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.400
Now, I won't take this away from Alex.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.400
Okay.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.440
Because there's a lot of, there's a lot of, you know, you got to give it up.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.080
When someone's right, they're right.

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:49.560
Alex is a newsman at times, and he does sometimes come through with hard hitting scoops.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.560
All right.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:53.160
And I will say that this is something I've not heard reported anywhere else.

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.160
Okay.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.160
That is giving me hope.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:06:02.560
I can tell you, he's eating at one sitting, two steaks, five lobster tails, giant bowls

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.240
of ice cream, and then eating prime rib as dessert and shoveling down piles of crab as

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.240
dessert.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.080
And they're going, well, they say he's eating three times we normally eat.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:15.040
Well, he's not going to last very long health-wise that way.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.040
Hard attack!

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.040
Hard attack!

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.040
Hard attack!

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.040
Alex is...

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.040
Hard attack!

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.680
Alex is reporting on Trump's outrageous appetite.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:23.680
That is...

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.680
He's eating...

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.680
That is...

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.680
Piles of crab for dessert.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:31.880
No, no, he's, he's, I think Skousen is probably the person that I agree with most on this

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:32.880
show.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.880
Wow.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.880
He's not going to last very long like that.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.880
Yeah.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:39.040
And I feel like that is a response too, because it's like, I know you're making that up, but

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.280
I don't want to fight you about it, so I'll just say, well, that's not healthy.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.280
That's a bummer.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.280
Yeah.

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.280
He really shouldn't do that.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:49.160
So Skousen, one of the things I've noticed that he does a lot is just make stuff up.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.160
Yeah.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:54.320
And what I worry about is, you know, over a hundred of those people have been arrested,

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.600
but all the list of the 36 people they put in, the suspects that they're looking for,

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.200
none of those were the agent provocateurs.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:05.640
If they did arrest some of those agent provocateurs, I think they'll be quietly released, because

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:10.320
you know, the high officer will be told, you know, these are our boys, let them go.

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:13.720
And that's what you never see because the press won't cover it, the police won't tell

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.720
you.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:15.720
Patriots never wear masks.

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:18.720
The whole thing is, all the guys doing this were wearing masks and backpacks.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:19.720
That's right.

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:20.720
Oh, the backpacks.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:21.720
Okay.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:28.000
Just so everybody on the right knows, if you were arrested at DC and then let go, you are

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Antifa.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Probably.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.880
So let's name them all by name.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.900
But also the problem with a theory like this, and the problem with the mentality like this

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:41.240
is like, you'll never hear about it if this thing I'm imagining happens, then you never

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.240
hear about it.

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.880
Oh wow, that theory came true.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:45.880
That prediction.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:46.880
Yeah.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.800
Amazing how you managed to predict a thing that didn't happen.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:54.560
The fact that you never hear about it is proof of the reality of this conspiracy.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:58.080
So I would say that one of the big things, the big takeaways from this interview with

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:05.320
Skousen is you get Alex pretty much agreeing with him that it's time to move on.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.280
Trump is useless now.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:11.920
He tried to do this little dictator push thing, and he's too weak.

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:12.920
He gave it a go.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:13.920
Yeah.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:19.320
I think the Trump movement is really going to be looking for new leadership, and Donald

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.320
Trump's going to be there.

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:23.740
He's got an ego, I think, that when he recovers from this, I think he's going to try to lead

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:24.740
the movement.

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:25.740
I'll debate him.

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:26.740
But I think we need to look to new leadership.

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:27.740
I really do.

01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:28.740
I agree.

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:31.560
And I don't want to be mean to Trump, but him being threatened with the 25th Amendment

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:35.240
folding like this has wounded him severely.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:39.560
And I just think he's going to still be a force and try to act like he can fix the Republican

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.560
Party.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.280
But again, he never had the intel to do it.

01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:44.820
His kids don't have it other than Don Jr.

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:45.820
They just don't get it.

01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:47.320
They just don't have the intel.

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.520
Well, that's right.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:55.480
Donald Trump's children, you know, and I worry about the Trump legacy, Don Jr. running or

01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:56.720
Ivanka or anything else.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.320
I think that's going to be bad for them.

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:00.920
These people have no conservative background.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:03.240
They don't have the arguments.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.800
They're just going to play the movement.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.360
And they're less sincere, in my opinion, than Donald Trump is.

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.360
I hate you so much.

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.360
Yeah.

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.360
I hate you so much.

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.920
I think Ivanka and Eric, definitely.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.040
Deep and burning.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.040
And Don's trying.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.960
And I don't think, I don't think he's, it's not that Don's dumb.

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.020
He's getting better.

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:23.100
He just, it takes decades to learn this and he just doesn't have it.

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.100
That's right.

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:25.100
You've got to be in the movement.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:30.280
I've been in this thing for 50, 60 years and I have all my uncle's background and my father's

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.280
background.

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.600
I mean, it just takes a lot of energy to develop an instinct where you can smell evil, where

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.400
you can smell the deep state and its presence.

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.720
And that's what we need to teach people to develop.

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:40.720
That's right.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:41.720
We're not bragging.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:42.720
We want to teach people this.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:43.720
We need to, exactly.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.960
We need to teach people how to make stuff up at every turn and call everything fake.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:53.520
I just know how it feels to be Don Jr. because I too was a shittier version of my dad and

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.520
I was worse at it.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:55.520
My uncle.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.520
Oh, whatever.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:00.880
Um, but yeah, it's a, it's a, yeah, it takes years and years of, you know, just taking

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:04.320
swings and, and being embarrassed about it to get over that.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.680
You gotta get rid of your embarrassment.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:09.160
You gotta be embarrassed for the first year and then you're free of it and you can say

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.160
whatever you want.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.160
Yep.

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.800
So, uh, it's like ninjutsu dude.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:13.800
Oh boy.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.800
Skousen is out.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:19.920
Um, and uh, now we get to what everyone has probably been waiting for and what I was the

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:23.640
most interested in on this episode.

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:28.840
Joining us is a man known as Q shaman.

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:33.440
Jake the barbarian, I guess was his earlier incantation or incarnation.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.000
So he's got the Q shaman on.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.360
He is the guy who, uh, may, you know, all the pictures of the guy in the fur and like

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.360
a helmet.

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.000
He had the horn helmet.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Yep.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.280
Um, I don't, I don't know anything about this guy except for that he's the Q shaman and

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.280
that's about all you need to know.

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.280
Really.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:52.400
I found, I found out about him whenever somebody said that guy's the Q shaman and I was like,

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.680
I know everything I need to know about this person.

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.880
I heard his name was Q shaman.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.840
He chose that name and was fine with it and I've worked backwards and I know everything.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:01.840
Yeah.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.820
It's like, uh, if you find out that some guy is the Riverside strangler while he strangles

01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:07.040
people probably by the river.

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.040
Yep.

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.040
Yep.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.040
Yep.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.040
That makes sense about that.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.040
I know enough.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.040
Yep.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040
Yep.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.040
And the Q shaman is a shaman of Q.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.040
Oh, it's the night stalker.

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.040
Does he stalk at night?

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.040
I believe he does.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:24.600
It's like, uh, Alex plays a clip of him from, uh, the day from, uh, outside the, uh, the

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.040
Capitol building.

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:31.520
And I don't think Alex pre-watch this because he's saying a lot of the same stuff that Alex

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:36.360
says and this whole thing was a setup that Alex was going to try and embarrass him and

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.200
try and be like a dick to him.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200
Yeah.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:42.240
And unfortunately he sounds like Alex.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.240
Okay.

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.960
We infiltrated, you can't move, but a hundred miles in any direction and you got a deep

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.440
underground base.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.680
Okay.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:50.680
That's pretty much all true.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:51.680
The guy could have a talk show.

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:55.720
He's very well spoken and boy does he know how to get attention in that outfit and, and

01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:00.840
you know, I have some fun with a joker sometimes to get attention, but the Q thing is problematic

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.920
and then he's in there in the middle of all this.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:06.100
I say, if you're a journalist, people go to the Capitol, go show what's happening.

01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:10.020
So Alex was ready to play that clip, come back from the other side and be like, can

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.400
you believe this nonsense?

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.200
But he's like, well, I can't argue with any of that.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:18.280
Well, I was talking to David Duke and it turns out we agree on a lot of stuff and it's a

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:21.280
real weird situation that I didn't see this coming.

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.280
Yeah.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:25.840
These are the kinds of things you would want producers to help you prepare for.

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.600
Alex, Alex, Alex, you're crazy.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:33.640
Well, it turns out that the shaman, who I refuse to call anything but the shaman.

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:34.680
Why would he have a name?

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.000
His name's Jake something or other.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.120
Who gives a fuck?

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.120
He got arrested.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.120
His name's Q shaman.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.840
He is now, he has now been arrested.

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.840
Put it in all caps.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:45.160
I'm a sovereign citizen of Q shaman.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.880
So he's a listener of Alex's show.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:47.880
Of course he is.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:48.880
He actually really likes Alex.

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.880
Of course.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.440
You can just call me Jake, Alex.

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.440
It's an honor to speak with you, sir.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.440
Okay.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.320
Well, an honor, I mean, I'm sure you're a great guy.

01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:00.920
You don't go off like a bad guy, but I mean, if you, if you say you're a listener, have

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:06.040
you heard me warn the stuff that Q is not invincible, that Trump's in a lot of trouble?

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:11.320
You know, I have heard those warnings, but you know, I'm of the belief that Q is military

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.280
intelligence and I have a lot of faith in the military and military intelligence.

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.280
Okay.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:19.160
Well, I was, they couldn't stop you from storming the Capitol building.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.680
I literally talked to all the top people.

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:22.680
Okay.

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:23.680
And they're all surrounded and cut off.

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:24.920
The tricoms are taken over.

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:26.440
They tell me we're in desperate straits.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.440
Ooh.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:32.560
See, this is what I find really remarkable about this is that he is one of, I mean, I

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:37.160
don't know, I don't know how much of there is like uniformity of belief, but a large

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.480
part of the Q world does not like Alex.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.480
Yeah.

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.960
There used to be someone who's fairly high profile in the Q world who also happens to

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:50.200
like Alex and it's trying to have this conversation with Alex that he doesn't, I don't think he

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.200
realizes it's a setup.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.720
He has no idea Alex is trying to be like, ha ha, you're so stupid.

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:54.720
Yeah.

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:55.720
Yeah.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:56.720
He has no idea.

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:57.720
He's like, I believe the same thing as you do.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:03.440
He's trying to use the shaman as a prop in order to de-legitimize the QAnon stuff as

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.080
part of the continuing, get people back from Q.

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.080
Right.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:14.360
This is what Alex could have said immediately, okay, you believe that Q is military intelligence.

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:17.560
Military intelligence absolutely must have known you were going to be at the Capitol

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.320
building and did not stop you.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.320
Right.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.720
But the argument there is that they wanted them to.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.720
Right.

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.720
Yeah.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:26.720
So Q betrayed you, Q shaman.

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:27.840
No, not at all.

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.720
Q shaman loves what happened on the sixth.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:34.960
Then it's not bad to fetus to tell America we're in trouble, need the general public

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:35.960
to get involved.

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.640
You understand that when the general public thinks everything's fine, they don't get

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.640
involved.

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:40.640
You understand?

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.800
And so there can be a silent takeover because they don't know, then that's a problem.

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:44.800
Does that make sense?

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:45.800
Oh, absolutely.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:49.200
That's why I'm quite proud of what happened on January 6th.

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:50.200
Okay.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:52.640
Tell us how you're proud of it.

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:53.640
Tell us what happened.

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:54.640
Oh God.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:15:01.780
Well, first of all, we are talking about a government that was literally telling people

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:07.240
when they can open their businesses, when they can see and hug their families, a government

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:12.540
that is literally affecting the way or trying to affect the way that their citizens breathe.

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:16.840
This is a problem for Alex because those are all arguments that he himself has made.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.840
Indeed.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.220
And now the Q shaman is coming in and explaining to Alex that this is tyranny and I'm proud

01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:26.340
that we stormed the Capitol because we should fight tyranny, which is also something Alex

01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:27.340
should believe.

01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:29.340
So he's Antifa.

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:30.340
Alex is Antifa.

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:31.340
I don't know.

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:33.480
But we're all Antifa, Dan.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.280
We're deep state Tifa.

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.620
Nothing is not real.

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:38.920
Also everything is not real.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.740
This is really complicated for Alex.

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:44.900
It's a position that I would, if I were him, I wouldn't have put myself in because I don't

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:47.320
know if there's any way to look decent in this circumstance.

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.320
No, it's not good.

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.840
It's the same thing with like, don't interview Bill Ayers.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:51.840
You're not going to win that.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:52.840
You're not supposed to be there.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:53.840
No, it's a disaster.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:54.840
That's not for you.

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:55.840
That's not for you.

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.840
I know it sounds fun to yell at David Rothschild.

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.840
Of course, you think it's going to be great.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:15:59.840
It's a bad idea.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:00.840
You'll look dumb.

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:01.840
You're kind of an idiot.

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:02.840
Yeah.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:05.880
You're so dumb that the Q shaman looks decent next to you.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.680
And that's because he likes you.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:12.920
And because he, like, I mean, I'm totally against him and I think he, everything I know

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:15.720
about him I don't support and I think he's wrong.

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:18.920
All I know is that he's the Q shaman and I agree with you on all points.

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:23.480
But there is a consistency to the beliefs.

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:29.200
He believes the same things Alex does and isn't trying to just scam people.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.320
And that's the tension.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:37.360
I mean, it can't come off literally anymore like, hey, Alex, you said you wanted this.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.360
Yeah.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.360
I did it.

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.360
Yeah.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.360
I'm proud of myself for doing it.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.360
What's going on with you, buddy?

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.360
Yeah.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.360
Yeah.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.760
It's kind of a gut check for Alex and I don't know if he's enjoying it.

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:50.400
So Alex is not into the idea of like storming the Capitol.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.400
Sure.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:57.040
He wants an abstract idea, like maybe a new declaration of independence and the shaman's

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.040
not so into that.

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:02.680
So to me, that sounds like treason on like the highest level.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:07.320
And if we have a right for a new declaration of independence, I just think it needs to

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:10.240
be done if we can't fix things peacefully at the right time, right place.

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:14.160
You can see how though Trump wants a 10 day investigation of fraud, we were about to get

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.160
it.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.800
How storming the Capitol screwed all that up.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:22.640
Well, I don't quite see it that way, Alex, to be perfectly honest with you.

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:28.900
I think that if anything, we sent a very clear message to the globalist and to the communist.

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:30.600
You sent a message.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.440
There's no clarity of that message.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.440
Yeah.

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:35.440
Not there.

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:40.320
I mean, there's some elements of it that are clear.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.320
That one's clear.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.320
Yeah.

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.320
Yeah.

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.320
What was the other one?

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.200
I mean, I'm scared, I guess that's clear.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:47.200
That's fair.

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:53.680
Yeah, I think that the shaman believes that they're up against a treasonous government

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:58.840
and they sent a very strong message with their actions and Alex can play this game where

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:03.480
he thinks that there's going to be a new declaration of independence, but shaman doesn't not into

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:04.480
that.

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:08.920
And he also doesn't agree with the idea that like, oh, we were going to get the 10 days

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:14.520
that Rudy Giuliani wanted and you all fucked that up by storming the Capitol.

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:20.220
And so Alex is trying to get the shaman to accept that the deep state who he's supposed

01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:23.760
to be against, they actually wanted him to do this.

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:24.760
Here we go.

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:27.040
You know Antifa helped break down stuff and wanted this to happen.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.240
I mean, you know, the deep state liked what happens, right?

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:32.880
Cause I mean, I know you think it showed them who's boss and all the rest of it, but I don't

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:38.160
think you get my perspective that Trump's now capitulating and all this, I mean, this

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.160
is not good.

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:42.160
Well, everybody has their opinion, Alex.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:45.000
And in all honesty, I understand where you're coming from.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.960
I just don't quite fully agree with you.

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:51.280
Do you think Trump's in a secret location in Texas and everything, and it's a CG of

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:52.280
him capitulating?

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:59.780
You know, in all honesty, I believe in Occam's razor, Alex, and I only talk about things

01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:03.640
that I know for certain I can prove or things that I know beyond a shadow of a doubt are

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:04.640
real.

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:05.640
Okay.

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:06.640
Yeah.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.520
I take issue with that, but it's not worth getting bogged down.

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.520
Yeah.

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.520
I'm just going to scream.

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:11.520
He's the Q shaman.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.720
I, you know, it's weird.

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.680
I can almost respect it.

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.240
Like if you do that shit, because what you believe in is that there's a treasonous government

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.680
and you're like, fuck it.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.360
I can't handle this anymore.

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.960
I'm going to go overthrow the goddamn country.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:30.320
And then you stick with it afterwards and you say, I believed that what I was doing

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.320
was right.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.200
I believed that it's necessary.

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:38.000
And sure, all of your beliefs are based on bullshit, but at least you believe shit.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.200
It's indicative, it's indicative of somebody who actually isn't like just playing games

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:45.480
or somebody who cares a little scarier.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.480
It's terrifying.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:49.820
And at the same time, I can't get around the fact that he's the Q shaman.

01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:50.820
There's that.

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:53.760
And you wouldn't be doing that kind of stuff unless you were trying to brand, unless you

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:57.600
were trying to like sell Q shaman shirts or something like that.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.320
Every revolution has color for characters.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.320
Yeah.

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:04.040
But there's, I mean, there's gotta be a grift in here somewhere, but it's far different.

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:07.840
Just like stancing like that could be, could be dislikes the outfit.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:10.920
But I'm just saying, I would, I respect him infinitely more.

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.960
Well, we have to parse respect.

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:17.080
Oh, well, well respect, I suppose respect is a form of fear.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:20.800
I'm more afraid of his bullshit because he's a believer.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:21.800
Yeah.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:26.040
I wanted to make sure people didn't hear you saying respect and be like thinking you applaud

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:27.040
or anything.

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:31.720
It's a, yeah, there, there's a, like at least, at least there's a consistency and I don't

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:35.700
think Alex was ready for that because I think that he doesn't, he's not used to be people

01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:36.700
who care.

01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:40.400
And I don't think, I think that he thought that this shaman was going to be some idiot

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:46.320
that he was going to be able to steamroll and he's disagreeing on multiple accounts

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:51.460
with Alex in a way that is not confrontational, but it's just like, oh, I think we don't see

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:53.040
eye to eye on that.

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.200
And Alex doesn't like that.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.280
There's something about underestimating your opponent.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:58.180
I heard that you're supposed to do that.

01:20:58.180 --> 01:20:59.880
Is that what you're supposed to do?

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:00.880
Underestimate all the time.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:01.880
It's always helpful.

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:02.880
Okay.

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.720
So I think that one of the things that I've always felt about QAnon and Alex and their

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:11.400
relationship with each other is part of Alex's feelings about it are, it's just petty jealousy.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:15.880
And like he's furious that everybody is talking about so many of the same things that he always

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:19.960
had conspiracies about, but they all think that Q uncovered it.

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:20.960
It's for me.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:21.960
I did it.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:22.960
Yeah.

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:23.960
I think he's a little jealous.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:27.040
And look, Jake, the barbarian, you're a very well spoken guy.

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.440
Let's think about the Q thing.

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:31.720
You're talking about the federal reserve, the new world order, secret technologies.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.720
All this is real.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:36.280
But then it's like, oh, Q, Q is why we know about it.

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:40.240
I know we know about it because of Cleon Skousen, we know about it because of Ron Paul, we know

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:44.440
about it because of Carole Quigley being a criminal and admitting it all, we know about

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:45.440
it because of Matt Brackett.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.680
It's not about the credit.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:47.800
We're all public people.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:48.960
Sounds like it's about the credit.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:49.960
Yeah.

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:53.160
It feels like the intensity of it really feels like it has something to do with the credit.

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.600
It feels a little bit like that.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:55.600
Yeah.

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:59.960
I don't think that if, let's imagine this is some sort of a fantasy world and QAnon

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:03.000
did manage to overthrow the world government.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.280
I don't think Alex would take that as a victory.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.280
Yeah.

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:07.280
Yeah.

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.280
Yeah.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:13.360
If everybody was throwing parties for Q shaman for successfully overthrowing the new world

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.520
order and everyone's like, Alex who?

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:22.420
But isn't that such like, oh, I want to live in a fascist nightmare so long as I'm on top.

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:25.680
I don't want to live in a fascist nightmare where Q is running things and I have to listen

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:26.680
to that asshole.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:27.680
Yeah.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:31.960
Yeah, Alex doesn't want his right wing fantasy world if it comes with Q.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:32.960
Exactly.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:33.960
Yeah.

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:34.960
Absolutely.

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.720
So this is the point where things I think really turn in the interview and this is where

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.000
it gets condescending.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.040
Alex starts being a real dick to Q shaman and it's tough for me to stand up for Q shaman

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.040
because I don't care.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.040
No, I'm fine with that.

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.040
Be a dick to him.

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:53.080
But like just from the standpoint of politeness, this is very impolite.

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:55.320
Go ahead Q shaman.

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:56.520
Tell me what's coming next then.

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:57.680
I want to believe it.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:58.680
Where is Trump?

01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:01.960
Do you think this is a devastating victory you just had at the Capitol?

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:05.440
Explain to me and bring me up to the level of a Q shaman.

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:10.560
Well, first of all, allow me to say that I am not Antifa.

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.720
I am not BLM.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:16.920
I know that there's rumors floating around online, probably disinformation agents spreading

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:17.920
disinformation.

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.200
So start with that.

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:23.480
I'm a Q supporter, a QAnon, digital soldier of sorts.

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:24.480
Yeah.

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:27.400
He's not Antifa.

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:30.280
And I don't think Alex is necessarily saying that he is.

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:34.480
I think that he's saying he's fooled by the Antifa provocateurs, but you can hear that

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:35.480
tone.

01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:36.480
You're a shaman.

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:39.040
Why don't you tell me about what's going on?

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:42.300
I feel like I would say it in the very similar tone though.

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:43.960
But I don't think you would have the interview.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.040
Oh no, of course not.

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.120
I don't think having this interview is a productive thing to do.

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:55.360
No, if we were in a bar and I was chained to one of the chairs and had no choice but

01:23:55.360 --> 01:24:00.160
to stay there, Q shaman sat down next to me and he started a conversation.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:04.000
Eventually I would get to the point where I'm like, all right, Q shaman, you tell me

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.760
what the fuck Q is up to.

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:06.760
Yeah, maybe.

01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.880
But Alex invited him on the show.

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.880
That's a little bit different.

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:12.600
I wouldn't invite Q into my home to then yell at him.

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:15.880
No, but Alex does because he wants to mock the dude.

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.880
What are you?

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:22.640
Are you a Norseman or are you a Q shaman?

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.640
What are you?

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.520
I am a shamanic practitioner.

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.520
Okay.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.400
I'm a spiritual warrior.

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.580
And if you really want to know what's really going on, what is really going on is we are

01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:33.840
changing the quantum realm, sir.

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:35.440
This is spiritual warfare.

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:40.280
And we understand that DC is built on ley lines, electromagnetic ley lines.

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:46.320
And we understand that yes, the Satanists, the Luciferians, the globalists, the nihilists,

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:50.560
the Nazis, these people that have infiltrated our government are practicing black magic.

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:54.920
They are doing evil, sick, satanic ceremonies and rituals where they're sacrificing children

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.600
and drinking blood and all that stuff.

01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:00.080
And the hub of it is in DC and London and in the Vatican.

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:05.520
If we understand that these things are like acting like a beacon for this low frequency

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.520
demonic energy.

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:07.520
Oh shit.

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:08.520
Okay, brother.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:09.520
Yeah.

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:10.520
Yeah.

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:11.520
I know the globalists are in the word stuff.

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.520
I'm trying to explain to you.

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:16.040
Q told us that Trump was invincible and Hillary was in a prison, right?

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.040
Yes.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.600
I'm saying is that Trump was going to be there in 12 days then?

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.440
I'm answering your question, interrupting.

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:22.440
So here's the thing.

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:23.440
Oh shit.

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:29.320
Q shaman for whatever, I mean, I guess you probably guessed this based on the fact that

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.040
he stormed the Capitol building.

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.320
He has a pretty healthy sense of self.

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.680
Does not give a fuck.

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:37.620
Pretty intact ego.

01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:39.120
That is well done.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:44.800
Alex, I don't know if you know this or not, but I stormed the Capitol building wearing

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.740
assless chaps and a helmet.

01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:51.200
Are you going to interrupt me like I give a fuck about you?

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.640
Your diversionary questions are not important to me.

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.560
I'm going to answer the question that was asked.

01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:00.040
So he's a shaman and you know, whatever.

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:05.580
I don't begrudge people for, or I don't even look down on the idea of spiritualism or whatever

01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:07.700
practice you want to have.

01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:13.280
That would not be the angle I would take to make fun of this.

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:20.300
But he does, he does think that they prayed in the Senate and they did some magic.

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:24.280
So here's the thing, because the Washington DC is built on ley lines, right?

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:26.840
It's built on the electromagnetic ley lines of the earth.

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:32.840
When we ended up going to DC, when we were shouting USA, when we're shouting freedom,

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:37.120
when we're shouting four more years, we are literally affecting the quantum realm.

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:41.920
We're like pygmies dancing around a fire or, or, or Navajo doing a ghost dance.

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:47.040
It's going to make the white man go away because sound supersedes electromagnetic activity.

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.040
Okay.

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:57.000
Now by marching into the Capitol, by the quantum realm in that way, we actually took back the

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Capitol building for God.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.280
I said a prayer inside the Senate.

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:08.720
I sang my shamanic song inside the Senate and I broke up all that negative shit.

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:12.080
It was your shamanic song right now on the air.

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.080
Do you want to talk?

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:14.080
Cause I'll just let you talk.

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.080
You're telling my God, I'm learning.

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:17.080
Occam's razor is a shamanic.

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:21.080
Then do me a favor and let me get finished, my brother.

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:22.080
I'm going to let you finish.

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.080
Let's get back in church.

01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.200
Well, we're now learning the secret of Q power.

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.200
He is a Q priest.

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.200
It is a religion.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.200
Everything's fine.

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:30.200
I don't know about all that.

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:32.840
I think that he can tell that Alex is being a dick to him.

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:33.840
Yeah.

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:34.840
Yeah.

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:37.240
See now if we're in a bar, I'm still chained to my chair and he's coming back at me with

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.240
that.

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:39.240
He's like, hi buddy.

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:40.240
Now we can talk.

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:45.880
There's some humanity there more than like Alex is going to let me finish my book.

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:49.720
So at this point, Alex goes the only route that he really knows how to do and that is

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:54.980
he's just going to decide to make fun of shamanism as a way to attack this guy.

01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:57.720
Don't engage with the things that I agree with.

01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:58.720
Yes.

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:01.760
Listen dude, shamanism is the oldest religion in the world.

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:07.520
They use singing, drumming, dancing, and they use elaborate dress, you know, the head dress,

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:16.440
the face to change the quantum realm through sound, through electromagnetic activity.

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:20.080
And he has a question for you and he's coming up after I leave.

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.220
If you want to talk to him, hold on.

01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:24.000
I understand magical powers.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.120
No, it's not about magic, dude.

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.800
We're talking about physics here, Alex.

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:28.800
We're talking about physics.

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:29.800
Okay.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:35.120
You are a shamanic lizard.

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.280
We get that.

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:39.680
It's just, it's sad.

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:43.240
It's not a productive conversation for anybody, but it's because of Alex.

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.240
Yeah.

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:48.400
I mean, it wouldn't be a productive conversation if the Q shaman was talking to anybody because

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:52.720
you'd be talking about ley lines and magical- No, it's not magic, Dan.

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:53.720
I'm sorry, it's physics.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:54.720
It's quantum physics.

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:55.720
Sorry.

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:56.720
It's quantum entanglement.

01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:57.720
Sorry.

01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:58.720
You know what that means.

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:04.200
That means whenever an electron from a single atom is paired together with another electron,

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:08.240
then for some reason, it doesn't matter how far apart they are, ley lines.

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:09.240
Right.

01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:10.240
I misspoke.

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:14.440
My point is that it wouldn't be a productive conversation with him and Cronkite.

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:15.440
No.

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:16.440
No.

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:17.440
Or a rock.

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:22.840
But Alex brought him in for the explicit purpose of trying to impugn Q.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:23.840
Yeah.

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:28.920
And now that isn't working and Alex can't really do anything, which you'd think he would

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:29.920
be able to.

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:30.920
Like he knows who Q is.

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:31.920
Yeah.

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:33.640
He should be like, I know these people.

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:36.520
Do you not understand?

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:39.960
Based on the things that he said, he should be able to completely deconstruct this easily,

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:40.960
but he can't.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:44.040
And so the only thing he can do is make fun of this guy's spirituality.

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:45.040
And that sucks.

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.040
That's childish.

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:50.640
It does seem like the easiest way for Alex to go would be like, excuse me, Q shaman.

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:52.240
You listen to my show, right?

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:55.480
I told you two months ago that I knew who Q was.

01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.600
I threatened to unveil it and then I didn't.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:58.600
Yeah.

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.640
So I'm just going to tell you who Q is right now.

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:02.680
And it's not military intelligence.

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:04.480
It's Dickface McGee over here.

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:05.480
Yeah.

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:06.480
And that would be the end of it.

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:10.040
I mean, obviously he would be like, that's not true, but then it would just be over.

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:13.800
You know, you wouldn't have to deal with any more of this whiny shaman bullshit.

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:17.560
Well, there doesn't need to be any conversation of like, what do you believe?

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:18.560
What do I believe?

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:19.560
I know them.

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.560
They're here.

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:21.560
Exactly.

01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:27.080
Based on what Alex has pretended to be aware of and to know as fact, he shouldn't be having

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:30.760
any kind of, I believe you believe conversation about this.

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:31.760
Totally.

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.720
It's something that should be a settled issue for him, frankly.

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:34.720
Yeah.

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:35.720
Yeah.

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:36.720
Yeah.

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.720
But it doesn't seem to be.

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:38.720
That's strange.

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:42.440
And it's really unfortunate to listen to because like the Q shaman is just saying stuff that

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:43.440
Alex agrees with.

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.920
And so he has to keep interrupting him.

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:50.960
I'm asking you with your wizard powers, why you were able to know that the Q was the answer.

01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:51.960
Tell me.

01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:52.960
Okay.

01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:55.920
Q is the highest levels of the military and the intelligence community disseminating above

01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:58.160
top secret information to Patriots in our Republic.

01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.160
This is full disclosure.

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:02.640
So we can take back our country from the communists and the globalists who are attempting this

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:06.240
in prison, so they can bring it down.

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:10.840
Why does he leave Julian Assange in prison when he's the real Q type person?

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.240
You keep interrupting the hours.

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:13.240
I love you, dude.

01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:17.320
I love you, but you gotta let me talk about the highest level of military intelligence.

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:18.320
Tell me more about it.

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.320
Are you waiting for your turn to speak, sir?

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:20.320
Are you listening?

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:23.000
Tell me about the highest level of military intelligence.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Okay.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Well, I mean, Alex had Zach, his fake insider dude who was supposedly the other Q or whatever.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.060
Alex has done all this shit.

01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:40.320
All the themes behind what Shaman is saying here are the things that Alex talks about

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:41.320
all the time.

01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:42.320
Totally.

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:46.000
Communists and globalists have infiltrated the government, and this is an exposure of

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
that.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
It's all exactly the same.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.140
And Alex can't, he can't attack the meat of it without hurting himself.

01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:57.840
And so he tries to distract with questions about Julian Assange, and then...

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:00.760
I mean, I would interrupt that spiel too, though.

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:01.760
That was...

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:05.480
I'm interrupting anybody who's trying to sell me a timeshare, and if you have rehearsed

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:10.280
your little bit like that, yeah, you know what you're doing.

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:15.840
If you invite someone onto your show to sell you a timeshare so you can interrupt them

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:20.080
to score points about how annoying it is when people try to sell you timeshares, that's

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:22.120
kind of a dick move.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:25.440
Yeah, isn't that Sacha Baron Cohen's job?

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:26.440
Wow.

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:29.080
There's more layers to it than that, but yeah.

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:35.040
So I just see the way that he's describing, the Shaman is describing his beliefs, it's

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:38.840
just basically a lot of the same stuff that Alex believes, but with a couple of different

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:39.840
characters.

01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:41.440
Like there's just a different cast.

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:42.440
Slightly different.

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:47.800
So Q is military intelligence disseminating above top secret information to patriots in

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:52.120
our republic so we can take back our country from communists and globalists who have infiltrated

01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:55.760
our government at some of the highest levels so that they could bring America down from

01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:56.760
within.

01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:58.760
This is infiltration instead of engagement.

01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:03.640
They're doing this so they can create a new world order, and they try to get rid of our

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:04.640
constitution based on their national law.

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:10.600
I know about the new world order, Q tells us the almighty Q Lord, and you are his priest,

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:11.600
tells us everything's fine.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:12.600
So does the...

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:14.600
I'm not saying everything's fine, you're interrupting me.

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:15.600
Put it in my mouth.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:16.600
I can't handle this guy.

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:20.200
I don't know if he's for real or whether he is hiring a kite, Matt Bracken, but this is

01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.520
crazy talk.

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.600
It's crazy talk?

01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:25.040
It doesn't sound any different than most of the stuff I hear on Infowars.

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:26.040
Not at all different.

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.040
No.

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:29.600
In no way different other than he's saying Q before.

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:30.600
Yep.

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:31.600
That's it.

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:32.600
That's it.

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:33.600
100% the same thing.

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:34.600
Yep.

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:35.600
Wow.

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:38.280
So Alex decides that the Shaman, this guy's an asshole.

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.280
I hear you.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.280
Matt Bracken, stay there.

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:42.280
I'm gonna do five more minutes with you and the guests, and I'm not trying to be mean

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:43.280
to the guests.

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:45.600
If Ellen wants to have him on, he's welcome to have him, or if he can have the guy back,

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.600
we'll let him talk.

01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:48.200
Cause it's very entertaining.

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:53.600
It's just that it's like, I tell this guy like, Hey, I'm dialed into all that stuff.

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:54.600
Okay.

01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:55.600
And they don't know what's going on.

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:56.600
Nobody does.

01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.600
He's just like, how is all the military intelligence?

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:00.960
How is all the military intelligence?

01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:05.320
I mean, they don't even, it isn't even like I tell people like real stuff like this is

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:06.320
going to happen.

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:09.680
Oh, Trump next week, we'll have a thing on the ellipse that was out for five days.

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:10.680
It's all real.

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:15.560
Who cares if you talk to Trump, we talked to the highest levels of military intelligence.

01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:16.560
You know?

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:21.280
And, and, and so it's just so frustrating to sit there and watch our people wake up,

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:23.800
but then believe the Charlton garbage.

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:29.400
This again, just seems like petty jealousy and like, why am I not Q?

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.360
Why am I not as important as Q?

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:35.440
It's so frustrating to see them buy those t-shirts with Q on it.

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:38.600
When they could be buying Infowars branded pills.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:39.600
And they could be buying.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:43.600
It's disgusting to see people wake up wearing a shirt with Q on it instead of taking two

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:44.600
of these pills.

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:48.840
They could buy my duct tape that I bought, the stickers that I told them to put over

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.120
your mouth that say, I am Q.

01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:51.120
Yep.

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.120
Yep.

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:53.120
Totally.

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:54.120
Totally.

01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:55.120
What are you doing wearing a shirt?

01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:56.120
This goes over your mouth.

01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.120
It's a shirt for your mouth.

01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:58.120
Yeah.

01:34:58.120 --> 01:34:59.120
So Alex has now turned the corner.

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.640
I really don't think that he likes this guy at all.

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:06.720
It's unfortunate because the guy has been very nice to Alex so far, but Owen wants

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:07.720
to clear up one thing.

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:11.320
Cause he's, he's now in studio cause he's going to be taking over the fourth hour.

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:16.680
Matt Bracken is also there hanging out just for moral support, I guess.

01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:21.040
Owen wants to know like, Hey man, people found an acting profile about you.

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.640
Are you an actor?

01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:25.760
I just want to address, you obviously said you're not antifa.

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:26.760
I don't think you're antifa.

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:29.120
The other thing people want to know about you is are you an actor?

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:31.480
They found a profile that says you went to an acting school.

01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:34.760
So they think you're acting and this whole thing is just an act.

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:36.440
So would you like to address that?

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:37.440
Abso-freaking-lutely.

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.440
Okay.

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:42.720
So the whole reason why I have an acting profile is because I worked with children for five

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:45.600
and a half years in group homes, traumatized children.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:49.360
And I got chased out of the home with a knife by one of the kids that pulled it out of a

01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:50.880
locked cabinet.

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:54.100
And I decided that I wanted to do something a little bit more fun.

01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:56.000
So I went into business for myself.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.840
I developed my own website, my own YouTube.

01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:02.120
I started writing books and I thought about, well, maybe I'll give acting a shot to earn

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.400
a little bit of money on the side.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.240
I haven't made any money as an actor.

01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:06.240
I never got anywhere.

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.240
You're not an actor.

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:08.240
We got that.

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:11.800
And they say I say I'm an actor because I've been in a few movies, it's a total bull.

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:12.800
Right.

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.200
He was almost in Guardians of the Galaxy.

01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:15.200
True.

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:16.200
He was going to be Star-Lord.

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:17.200
He was going to be Star-Lord.

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.200
So close.

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:19.200
He's so close.

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:20.200
He just wouldn't worship the devils and he wouldn't let them do it.

01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:23.280
He wouldn't take too much money for it.

01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:24.280
Yeah.

01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:30.240
So, hard-hitting questions there to dispel internet conspiracies that won't go away because

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:32.920
this guy said he's not an actor on Alex Jones' show.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:33.920
No, no, no.

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:34.920
Completely a waste of time.

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:35.920
No, no, no.

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:42.280
Alex and Infowars' followers are well known for, if somebody says they're not an actor,

01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:43.280
believing them.

01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:50.080
So Alex is taking the approach that he's sort of trying to shame and belittle the Q shaman.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:56.640
And I would argue that somebody who makes their business going around to protests dressed

01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:00.360
that ridiculously for the sake of getting attention, you're not going to be able to

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:01.360
shame them.

01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:02.360
You can't embarrass them.

01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:03.600
I would be surprised if you could.

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:04.600
Yeah.

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:05.600
It doesn't work.

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:08.000
Listen, you're a Q wizard, okay?

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.600
I'm asking you, does Trump end in 12 days?

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:12.600
Does Trump what?

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.160
What happens to Trump?

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.160
Q knows everything.

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.160
You know military intelligence.

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:17.160
What happens to Trump?

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:19.160
Well, you know what, man?

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:26.040
All I can say is I think that Donald Trump is a part of a much larger plan, whether that

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:29.360
be a military plan, whether that be God's plan.

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:34.440
I think that when you look at harmonics, when you look into the way that energy, frequency

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:42.120
and vibration basically create and move all physical form, all matter, then we're all

01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:47.360
playing a part in a much larger, grander scheme, a much larger, I'm not saying there's no harmonics

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:48.360
and greater schemes.

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:51.360
And then terrible stuff.

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.360
I know all that.

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:53.360
But I'm saying, hold on, hold on.

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:54.360
I'll let you talk.

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:55.360
But I got to say this.

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:59.880
I got to say this, but Q told us Trump was invincible and everybody was going to get

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:06.920
hit, though, so I'm saying Q leads us once Trump's gone still is what you're saying.

01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:12.040
What I'm saying, and this is you putting words in my mouth again, Alex, what I'm saying is

01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:18.280
that Donald Trump is a part of a much larger plan to help us take back our country from

01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:19.280
globalists and communists.

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:22.480
He's the baby toe of military intelligence, aren't you?

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:24.120
But Alex has said that, too.

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:25.120
Yeah.

01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:26.120
A bunch.

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:30.880
And of course, this leads to its natural conclusion, which is Alex is going to blow up and yell

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:31.880
at this guy.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:32.880
Have a little hissy fit.

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:33.880
Yes.

01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:34.880
Yeah.

01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:41.920
And I just don't know what actual difference there is between their beliefs.

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:50.240
Donald Trump has played a very pivotal role in exposing the globalists and the cabal,

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:54.320
exposing the Chinese and the communists and the way that they've infiltrated our government,

01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:58.160
the way they've infiltrated our media, the way they've infiltrated our entertainment,

01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:59.720
the way they've infiltrated all that.

01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:00.720
We broke all that.

01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:01.720
We know that.

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:04.960
I'm saying Q tells us stuff and all of its lies is what I'm saying.

01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:09.680
You keep interrupting me because you're lying god damn thing out of your people's mouth

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:10.680
doesn't come true.

01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:14.360
And it's always, oh, there's energy and oh, now we're done with Trump.

01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:16.080
You said he was the Messiah.

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:17.720
You said he was invincible.

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.720
You said it was all over.

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:20.720
They were all going to get more.

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.960
Now, oh, he's part of a larger thing of Q.

01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:25.600
I will not suffer your Q people after this.

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:30.720
I knew what you were day one, I know what you are now, and I'm sick of it.

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:36.440
I'm sick of all these witches and warlocks and pumpkin popsums and everything.

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:37.440
Sorry.

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:44.200
Bye bye Q, I can't talk to you anymore, Jesus, Lord help me.

01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:48.360
That was an uncalled for response, I would say.

01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:52.080
Dan, if he's sick of those witches, I think it's time to call Larry Nichols.

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:53.080
Yeah.

01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:59.080
Um, I think that, you know, I don't know if Alex had the same preoccupation with Guantanamo

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:03.280
Bay as the Q folks did, but he definitely had a lot of like, they're about to get arrested

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:04.280
kind of bullshit.

01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:05.280
They're going to jail soon.

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:08.400
Trump is invincible is certainly like a theme of...

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:11.720
I mean, he's literally chosen by God to defeat the devil.

01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:14.480
Alex has said that a whole bunch of times.

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:18.520
There's not a lot of light between these two ideologies.

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:22.720
And I think that one of the reasons that Alex does do that fake blowing up there is because

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:29.160
I think it's like the way he's presented Q and QAnon stuff is very different than what

01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.560
this guy is bringing to the table.

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:35.600
And for the audience to become aware that like, oh no, they're not all crazy the way

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.480
that Alex wants you to think.

01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:39.440
There's talk about the Federal Reserve.

01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:41.680
There's talk about these deep underground bases.

01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:42.680
There's demons.

01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:45.140
Hey, I like that.

01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:47.760
The elites are sacrificing kids and drinking their blood.

01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:49.320
Alex is in on that.

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:51.360
Maybe there's something I should look into here.

01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:54.080
Alex runs the risk of this blowing up right in his face.

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.120
If you get to see clearly that they're pretty similar.

01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:02.640
I think I would also argue that there's nothing Alex hates more than a mirror, especially

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:05.000
one that's younger than him.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.960
Like that's... because listen to the way he's talking, he's rambling, he's saying all kinds

01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:09.960
of nonsense.

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:12.920
He's rattling off bullshit that he's memorized.

01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:17.320
He's unwilling to be interrupted for any stretch, for any reason.

01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:18.920
He's claiming his space.

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:19.920
Exactly.

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:24.920
This is an... like this dude is a person who loves Alex Jones.

01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:30.240
Who has developed much of his persona clearly around his love of Alex Jones.

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:34.020
Yeah, it's at least a strong influence.

01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:37.480
No one hates Alex, maybe, more than Alex.

01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:39.800
And no one hates people who like Alex, more than Alex.

01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:40.800
Yeah, exactly.

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:41.800
But you know what?

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:42.800
Owen kind of likes the shaman.

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:43.800
Ugh.

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:50.120
I want to believe that they'll never, when they're wrong, say they're wrong.

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:53.640
Oh no, Trump's a small part of the larger Q universe.

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:54.640
Ninjutsu.

01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:55.640
Ninjutsu.

01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:56.640
Really?

01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:57.640
No, you're full of crap.

01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:58.640
Ninjutsu.

01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.640
We don't want your last word.

01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:00.640
Oh!

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:01.640
Oh!

01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:02.640
Oh!

01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:03.640
Only if it...

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:04.640
Is he Q?

01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:05.640
We have Q on the line.

01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:11.000
Yeah, sure, we'll get a last word from Lord Q on the other side.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.360
So they go to commercial break, and they come back, and Alex is true to his word.

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:16.960
He is going to give the shaman a last word.

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:25.600
Alright, I'm gonna be nice to the Q sorcerer, Q wizard, no no, the official name is the

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:27.880
Q shaman.

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:29.360
He's hopping mad at me.

01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:32.300
But people started to recognize something, as soon as I showed up at the Capitol two

01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:38.800
days ago, Owen was right beside me, he disappeared for several hours in a phone booth and came

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:42.440
out as the Q wizard.

01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:43.440
Good bit.

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:44.440
That's the bit, huh?

01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:45.440
Oh boy.

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:47.920
I would say that he's right to be really mad at him.

01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:48.920
Yeah.

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:52.760
And so he does get his last word, the shaman gets his last word, and it's just a long plug

01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:56.640
for his Rumble page, because he's not allowed on YouTube.

01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:57.800
Sure, well yeah.

01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:01.360
And then Alex calls him a lightweight.

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:06.840
I got stuff on there exposing the UN, I got stuff on there about aliens and the truth

01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:10.600
about aliens and where aliens come from, how they're actually inter-dimensional beings,

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:15.640
just as much as they are like, quote unquote, extraterrestrial beings, I've got a video

01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:19.760
on there called Just Take the Red Pill, that's five and a half hours, that if you really

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:22.960
want to know everything that there really is to know to get caught up to speed here

01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:26.640
and now, all you have to do is just watch that one video and it'll explain a whole lot

01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:27.640
of things that most people don't understand.

01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:28.640
That's two end games.

01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:29.640
Okay, that's enough.

01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:34.240
I've heard the plug about you, you didn't counter anything we said, the whole cube image

01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:38.160
looks completely full of crap and has been full of crap the entire time, it's a big

01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:40.680
sick joke on us, it probably just cost us the country.

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:41.680
Thanks for the call.

01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:45.720
I mean, I just, I cannot, Matt Bragg, you had to sit through 20 minutes of that insufferable

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:50.680
garbage, and I'm not trying, he's a well-meaning person, but he's a lightweight man.

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:54.200
It's all this Harry Potter, hocus pocus crap, and we're in the real world.

01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:58.040
I'm like, I'm not going to tell this guy what's going on, because he can't even handle

01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:00.040
it, but it's, he just doesn't get it, does he?

01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:03.360
All this Harry Potter crap, and now I'm going to talk to you about the devil.

01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:09.720
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, the shaman who's dealing with ley lines and quantum

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:12.000
physics just can't handle it?

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Can't handle it.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
I think he could handle it.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.560
No, Alex, Alex wants to give the appearance that he has something deeper, but if he was

01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:23.320
forced to actually talk about it, it would be like when he's on Rogan and he realized

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:24.320
like, oh, he doesn't really have anything.

01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:25.320
He doesn't know anything.

01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:26.320
No.

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:27.320
God.

01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:28.320
That's really a dumb thing to do.

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.880
I hate him so much.

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:37.300
Alex is not good at confrontational interviews with sincere people, because they aren't running

01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:41.200
a scam that they care about what Alex thinks about.

01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:45.080
You know, like there's probably some emotional level that the Q shaman would like to have

01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:47.160
a positive exchange with Alex.

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:53.440
He looks up to him, but he also isn't invested in the Infowars scam in the same way that

01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:55.600
all of Alex's guests are.

01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:00.960
Matt Bracken has no other like media outlet that will ever talk to him.

01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:03.280
No one gives a fuck about him except for Alex.

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:05.040
And so he's part of the game.

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:10.600
Owen Troyer works, everybody that he talks to is at least in some way, um...

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:11.600
Transactional.

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:12.600
Yeah.

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:13.600
There's a power dynamic.

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:15.540
Either Alex is higher or lower.

01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:17.660
Everybody knows where they stand.

01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:20.500
Everybody knows that they're working towards the shared goal of grifting.

01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:22.920
And Alex can work really well in that space.

01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:29.160
Or at least he can operate there because people know not to contradict him, not to get too

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:30.160
out of line.

01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:32.520
If he interrupts you, just roll with it.

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:37.120
But yeah, you got someone like the Q shaman, and he thinks that he is higher on the totem

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:38.120
pole.

01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:39.120
The power dynamic is different.

01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:40.400
He just stormed the Capitol.

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:44.160
I bet that dude's riding a wave of adrenaline that is still going.

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:45.440
Well, he's in jail now, so...

01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:49.280
Yeah, and I bet he's fucking flying off the walls.

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:51.700
Yeah, it's complicated.

01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:54.680
There's a power imbalance, but it's, uh, uh...

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:55.680
Perceptional.

01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:56.680
Yeah.

01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:00.720
They each think that they're the top dog on this call, and it infuriates Alex.

01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:05.160
Yeah, I imagine that the Q shaman thought he was doing a victory lap.

01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:12.080
You know, I just got the most national attention, worldwide attention, my picture's on the world

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:16.200
right now, so Alex Jones is calling me because I'm fucking famous.

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:20.400
Yeah, and maybe we have some slight disagreements, but we can work that out.

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:24.200
And I'm a fan of his, so I'll charm him up top, we'll have a nice little conversation.

01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.280
He's a rational guy.

01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:28.200
We agree with each other on everything.

01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:32.360
Why would he not take me at my word as a sincere person?

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:36.880
We agree on literally everything about the globalists and the blood drinking and the

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:38.280
Chinese and the communists.

01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:40.360
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on, Alex.

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:44.640
Hold on, are you saying that I can't trust far-right media figures because they will

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.640
cut bait and abandon me as soon as I'm not useful to them?

01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:49.640
Uh-oh.

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:50.640
Uh-oh.

01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:51.640
I might need to rethink.

01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:52.640
Nothing!

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:56.960
I mean, and also, not for nothing, Alex is far from the only person who's shitting on

01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:58.800
this dude for doing exactly what...

01:46:58.800 --> 01:46:59.800
They want to do.

01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:00.800
Yeah.

01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:01.800
And they were told to do.

01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:02.800
Yeah.

01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:03.800
Yeah.

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:04.800
It's kind of...

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:05.800
Ugh.

01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:08.200
It's kind of like the most predictable thing ever.

01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:12.000
I wonder if anybody had said that this would happen.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.240
So Alex, look, if he was there, things would have gone differently.

01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.080
He probably would have tackled the Q shaman.

01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:19.080
Sure.

01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:20.080
We had a rally.

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:21.080
Trump won it.

01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:22.080
We had other rallies.

01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:23.080
They were great.

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:24.080
I'm like, oh, the Capitol Police will handle it.

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:25.080
Yeah, Antifa says they're coming to disrupt.

01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:26.080
They'll handle it.

01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:27.080
And we should have been down there.

01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:29.320
If I'd have been there with 20 of our guys, we would have stopped this.

01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:30.320
Yeah, man.

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:31.320
We would have stopped it.

01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:33.120
If I and 20 guys...

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:34.120
Of our guys.

01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:38.460
Of our guys, who are specifically very large, I hired them from the same people that Antifa

01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:39.460
hired from.

01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:42.400
If 20 of our guys couldn't get 20 of them because they were busy at the time.

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.560
Yeah, they were hired by Antifa.

01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:46.900
I mean, no, okay.

01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:51.600
So we have one last clip here from the 8th, and in the same way that the out of context

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:58.400
drop that I'll get to this next segment, maybe, is a perfect, just boiled down Alex Jones

01:47:58.400 --> 01:47:59.400
moment.

01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:00.400
Sure.

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:02.240
This minute is this is Alex right here, baby.

01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:06.480
The Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m., ahead of the great job you're doing, Sunday live, that's

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:09.060
6 to 8, with only six minutes of ads an hour.

01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:11.780
We've cut it to just local ads for radio and TV stations.

01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:12.780
We've cut our ads.

01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:16.320
And if I wasn't partnered with GCN, who are wonderful people, I would cut us from the

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:17.900
14 minute ads.

01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:21.420
It's customary and talk radio, you know, to to less just for locals.

01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:22.480
But I love to have that.

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:27.280
I'm working on just having local ads for you folks and cutting it to six, seven minutes

01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:29.640
of ads an hour just for local stations.

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:31.880
I wonder why our plugs once an hour live on air.

01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:32.880
I'm about to right now.

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:36.620
Ladies and gentlemen, we've proven we're the tip of the spear.

01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:40.040
We've proven that we're dialed in to as much as you can learn.

01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:42.520
And believe me, you learn nobody's in control.

01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:44.700
But God, the devil's trying to be in control.

01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:45.840
He's not in control.

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.400
And man's trying to control.

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:48.640
That's a joke.

01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:52.320
So gzping and communism claiming government can be God's a lie.

01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:54.720
Q claiming everything's great and everybody's got a plan.

01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:55.720
That's a lie.

01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:56.960
The only plan is Jesus Christ plan.

01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:59.360
I'm here to tell you that only trust in God.

01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:03.380
That's the only perfect thing there is in full work store dot com, though, gives you

01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:04.680
what God created.

01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:11.540
Our official that's good.

01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:12.540
Give it to me.

01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:13.540
Yeah.

01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:14.600
Inject that into my veins.

01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:17.240
That's the kind of ad pivot that will give you an overdose.

01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:19.240
You don't have to.

01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:20.240
Yeah.

01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:21.240
Damn.

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:23.040
There's so many awesome layers to that.

01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:26.400
It starts with him talking about wanting to have less commercials on the show.

01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:27.400
Sure.

01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:29.120
And then he's wanting to definitely not.

01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:30.120
Right.

01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:31.120
Ted Anderson won't let him.

01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:32.120
Yeah.

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:33.120
Interesting.

01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:34.600
That business relationship.

01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:35.600
Sure.

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:39.520
But then he's like, you know, we do our ads on the show, like I'm about to do.

01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:40.520
Yeah.

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:42.980
Then he starts talking about how God's plan is.

01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:45.320
So that was intended to be part of the plot.

01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:46.320
Indeed.

01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:48.640
And you trust God's plan and it in for store.

01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:49.640
What do you get?

01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:50.640
All the stuff that got me.

01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:51.640
Oh, baby.

01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:52.720
Like krill oil.

01:49:52.720 --> 01:50:00.880
I don't know if you can possibly take the like by definition of those like those words

01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:03.360
like there were 10 of them.

01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.080
Pretty important to people who love the Bible.

01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:06.080
Yeah.

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:07.080
All right.

01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:12.080
I'm fairly certain that you cannot take God's name in vain more than he just did.

01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:14.840
I think that's the most you can do.

01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:16.880
There was some vainness to it.

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:19.160
There is a little bit of vainness there.

01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:20.160
Yeah.

01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:25.780
So I find I find this stretch right after the storming of the Capitol at the end of

01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:26.780
last week.

01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:32.000
Kind of interesting, but also kind of kind of I don't know.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.280
I guess what you'd expect.

01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:35.720
You know, it is it is.

01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:36.720
Sorry.

01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:38.600
I want to sorry to regress for one second.

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:39.600
No, no.

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:40.600
Go ahead.

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:44.360
I would like you to play just the short clip of him saying, we've proven that we're the

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:51.560
tip of the spear right next to go home, go home curfew, go home respect to the curfew.

01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:52.560
Exactly.

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:53.920
Tom Papert saying he sent his reporters home.

01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:54.920
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:55.920
The women.

01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:56.920
Yeah.

01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:57.920
We've proven where the tip is.

01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:58.920
Sorry.

01:50:58.920 --> 01:50:59.920
Sorry for interrupting you.

01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:00.920
Oh no, that's fine.

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:01.920
I just needed to be to get that out.

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:06.200
I would be lying if I said that any of this surprised me.

01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:09.240
Like Alex's behavior is very predictable.

01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:13.980
You know, you want you want the ride to the the storming.

01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:15.920
You don't want the storming to actually happen.

01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:24.100
He needs that that that state prior to conflagration to make money off of because let's say they

01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:26.440
had set fire to the Capitol building.

01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:27.440
Right.

01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:35.040
Then it investigations would be very crippling to to to right wing organizations, militias

01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:36.040
figures.

01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:37.040
Not good.

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:42.220
You know, if more people had died, it certainly would be far more serious.

01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:47.080
And Alex can't profit in that that ecosystem, that environment.

01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:51.100
And so obviously this is, you know, put the blame on somebody else.

01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:55.600
This is a false flag because they were scared of how close we were to getting that 10 days

01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:57.880
that Rudy wanted and we'd overturn the election.

01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:58.880
Yeah.

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:00.600
And also at the same time, Trump has shown his ass.

01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:03.960
And so he's too weak and we need to look for new leadership.

01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:06.160
It's it's all very predictable.

01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:07.160
Yeah.

01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:08.580
It's just so brutal.

01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:15.040
It's so brutal that the tactic after this is not because it's it's so obvious.

01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:17.040
Like all right.

01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:21.900
You see the way acts now and you work backwards and you go, oh, obviously he wants to rile

01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:27.780
people up into a state of constant fury and then that will get him money.

01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:30.580
Their emotional connection will get him money.

01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:34.340
And then when they did something, he realized that that would cost him money.

01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:37.780
And so he stopped, he changed his mind, quote unquote.

01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:39.420
He betrayed us.

01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:42.240
And so we can't trust him anymore.

01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:46.500
And instead it's just, how about I throw two different types of cognitive dissonance at

01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:52.640
you all the time into your brain so much and so hard that you can't even see through that

01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:55.480
I'm obviously in this for money.

01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:56.480
Yeah.

01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:57.840
How can you not see through that?

01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:01.280
How could you not see through when he says like God's plan is the only one that's real

01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:02.280
and info restore.

01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:03.280
You can get what God gave you.

01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:06.780
I mean, how could you not like think this guy is a fucking asshole?

01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:07.780
Totally.

01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:09.620
Now that I agree with you, but you know what?

01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:10.940
Peace time is peace time.

01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:14.460
People are fucking lazy and full of shit.

01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:17.940
This was a day after the goddamn storming of the Capitol.

01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:18.940
Two.

01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:19.940
Two days after.

01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:20.940
Day and two days.

01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:24.660
That should be fresh enough into your mind to where you go, oh, I got knocked out of

01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:27.740
the head space that I was normally in and it's just nothing.

01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:28.740
Yeah.

01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:33.940
Well, I mean, we saw how quickly he went to like, first of all, calling Sandy Hook a false

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:34.940
flag.

01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:35.940
Yeah.

01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:39.500
We saw how quickly the Boston bombing became a conspiracy and it makes sense.

01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:43.260
Like the fact that this is a giant event.

01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:44.260
Sure.

01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:45.260
And I honestly don't.

01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:49.220
But he wasn't leading the Boston bombing and he wasn't at Sandy Hook.

01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:50.220
He was there.

01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:54.420
But that's, that's what makes it even more critical for him to make it a false flag.

01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:55.420
Yeah.

01:53:55.420 --> 01:53:57.900
A good thing that went bad because of the trickery of Antifa.

01:53:57.900 --> 01:53:58.900
Yeah.

01:53:58.900 --> 01:54:02.460
He has an even greater connection to it.

01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:06.900
But that, that again, this goes to one of the other theses that I have.

01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:11.860
And that is that one of the primary ways that Alex makes money is by profiting off of and

01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:12.860
exploiting tragedy.

01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:13.860
Yeah.

01:54:13.860 --> 01:54:14.860
And this is a tragedy.

01:54:14.860 --> 01:54:17.720
No matter what, like ends up coming from it.

01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:22.820
And I don't think that we have fully processed the reality of the last week.

01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:23.820
Oh no, absolutely.

01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:26.700
And I don't think that you could, I just don't.

01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:30.380
It's staggering and almost surreal.

01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:31.380
Yeah.

01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:32.380
I don't know.

01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:33.380
Yeah.

01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:34.380
And nothing good.

01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:35.380
It's not good.

01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:36.380
No.

01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:38.660
And that is the kind of thing that Alex can make money off of.

01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:44.660
The only thing I would say I was kind of surprised about is the turning tack a little bit about

01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:45.780
the woman who got shot.

01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:46.780
Yeah.

01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:51.940
I don't think that I felt him martyr building as much as he was the day of.

01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:56.220
Well, you can't martyr build and deescalate.

01:54:56.220 --> 01:54:58.660
You can only do one or the other.

01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:00.780
Once you got a martyr, you're going up.

01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:01.780
It does.

01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:02.780
There's no going back.

01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:03.780
It does seem that way.

01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:09.140
And I think the fact that she was really into Q kind of hurt his ability to create the perfect

01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:10.140
figure out of that.

01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:11.140
Yeah.

01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:15.120
You can't scream at how stupid Q shaman is and then be like, this Q believer is also

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:17.380
our new Virgin Mary.

01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:18.380
Yeah.

01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:24.060
You can turn them into a figure of empathy and reverence.

01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:25.060
Yeah.

01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:30.700
And the path that they were going down on the sixth couldn't be continued.

01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:37.420
Anyway, I have a feeling that shit's going to be bad this week.

01:55:37.420 --> 01:55:43.780
If the plan or the thing that's been speculated is that there may be another impeachment article

01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:45.700
coming down on Monday.

01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:49.460
And if that's the case, then I would expect that Alex is going to have some choice words

01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:50.800
about that.

01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:52.020
And so we'll see what happens.

01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:58.180
But I don't look, I don't, I don't see by future prospects of relaxing being that good.

01:55:58.180 --> 01:56:00.220
I do love how stupid America is.

01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:01.220
Yeah.

01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:02.220
It's incredibly stupid.

01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:09.380
It's so unbelievably, ridiculously stupid to stop for one second and think on Wednesday,

01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:14.260
the president had cited a riot and people stormed the Capitol building.

01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:20.820
So because of this action, we will swiftly draw up articles of impeachment, which we

01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:27.940
will absolutely be delivering to the Senate 100 days after Biden's inauguration, thus

01:56:27.940 --> 01:56:30.260
solving the problem once and for all.

01:56:30.260 --> 01:56:31.260
Yeah.

01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:32.260
Yeah.

01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:36.780
I mean, I don't know what else you do, but I don't, I don't, well, you got a couple of

01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:37.780
years.

01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:38.780
All right.

01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:39.780
So we'll be back.

01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:40.780
But until then Jordan, we have a website.

01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:41.780
We do have a website.

01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:42.780
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:43.780
We're also on Twitter.

01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:44.780
We are on Twitter.

01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:46.860
It's at knowledge underscore fight not go to pet Jordan.

01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:48.300
We're also on Facebook.

01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:54.380
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:55.820
doing God's work right now.

01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:56.820
Oh, we'll be back.

01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:57.820
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:56:57.820 --> 01:56:58.820
I'm Leo.

01:56:58.820 --> 01:56:59.820
I'm DZX Clark.

01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:00.820
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:08.660
I, if I had 21 guys, I could defeat Alex and 20 guys.

01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:09.660
Maybe not.

01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:10.660
Probably not.

01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:11.660
I'm not really much help.

01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:12.660
Andy in Kansas.

01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:13.660
You're on the air.

01:57:13.660 --> 01:57:14.660
Thanks for holding.

01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:15.660
Hello, Alex.

01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:16.660
I'm a first time caller.

01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:17.660
I'm a huge fan.

01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:18.660
I love your work.

01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:47.660
I love you.
