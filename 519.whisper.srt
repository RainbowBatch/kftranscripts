1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys, a knowledge

2
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,360
fight.

3
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,320
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys, a knowledge

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
fight.

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,320
Dan and Jordan, knowledge fight.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,320
Need, I need money.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,320
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,320
Andy and Candace, Andy and Candace.

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,320
Stop it.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,320
Andy and Candace, Andy and Candace.

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,320
It's time to pray.

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,320
Andy and Candace, you're on the air.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,320
Thanks for holding us.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
Hello, Alex.

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,320
I'm a first-time caller.

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
I'm a huge fan.

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
I love your room.

19
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
Knowledge fight.

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:55,320
Knowledgefight.com.

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,320
I love you.

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,320
Hey, everybody.

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,320
Welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm Dan.

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,320
I'm Jordan.

26
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
We're cool dudes.

27
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,040
I like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

28
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,400
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Jordan.

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Dan.

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Jordan.

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
I have a quick question for you.

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
What's up?

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
What's your bright spot today?

35
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
My bright spot today, Jordan, is hoodies.

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Hoodies?

37
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
I got a new hoodie.

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
You did get a new hoodie?

39
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Mm-hmm.

40
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
Oh, Miskatonic University.

41
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Is that a real place?

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Arkham, Massachusetts.

43
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Oh.

44
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
What happened?

45
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
That's Lovecraft University.

46
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Yeah, I imagine so.

47
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,120
Yeah, it takes me forever to buy clothes.

48
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,840
I just never end up doing it.

49
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,080
I've had the same clothes forever, and I've needed some new hoodies.

50
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,400
It's winter, basically wearing a sweater pretty much every day.

51
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,920
And so I've added some spice to my life.

53
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
I like it.

54
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,200
And this one, I got also another one that's at the Miskatonic University Antarctic Expedition.

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Sure, sure.

56
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,360
That's the Mountains of Madness reference.

57
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Very, very... I got too much Lovecraft hoodies.

58
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
No, no.

59
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
You're golden.

60
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
You're golden, Dan.

61
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,680
I just couldn't decide on anything that I wanted to get that would be like, I can handle

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,400
wearing this in public, and it's something that I like.

63
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Yeah.

64
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,640
Like, I can wear this, and no one would look twice at it, but if it was like Cthulhu or

65
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,640
something- Sure, sure, sure.

66
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,240
I would feel very uncomfortable.

67
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,960
People would have to do a double take, and then they'd be like, oh, I get it.

68
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
Yeah.

69
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Otherwise, it just looks like it's a college hoodie.

70
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,960
It's a normal college shirt.

71
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

72
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Absolutely.

73
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
So I made that compromise.

74
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,200
That's better than what I do with clothes, which is just every six months, I buy five

75
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,700
different colors of the same shirt and wear it.

76
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,700
That's not too bad.

77
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,160
I think that there's a lot of decision paralysis that you get rid of when you do that.

78
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

79
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,240
When you model your clothing choices on Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes, I think it solves

80
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,400
a lot of problems before they begin.

81
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,240
Yeah, yeah, because then you're just like, oh, grab this same thing, put it on.

82
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
It's a great shirt.

83
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,820
This one's blue, and the other one's teal.

84
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,820
It's a different shirt.

85
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,820
Yeah.

86
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,820
So Jordan, how about you?

87
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,820
What's your bright spot?

88
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:01,120
My bright spot, Dan, was this year, they just ended the GDQ for 2021.

89
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,840
They just ended Games Done Quick, and it was a bunch of fantastic stuff, a lot of good

90
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:14,560
runs, and they raised over two million even in this kind of fucking year, so that's really,

91
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
really cool.

92
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
That is cool.

93
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
It made me happy.

94
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
That is a lot of fun.

95
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
So it's a bright spot.

96
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
Yeah.

97
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,800
I'm still wishy-washy a tiny bit about watching video games.

98
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,880
I can watch some of the people who put up Mario Maker videos.

99
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,360
See, those are the ones that I watch.

100
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Yeah.

101
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Because those are so hard.

102
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
Oh, yeah.

103
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,000
It's offensive almost how hard those levels are that people make.

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, no.

105
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Because that's the point.

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,080
That was one of the things this year, I don't think it closed it, but it was one of the

107
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,880
last four runs, and this dude was playing the hardest Mario Maker level that wasn't

108
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
even Mario Maker.

109
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
It was a hack.

110
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:56,360
It was a kaizo hack, and the previous world record was 35 minutes, and he did it in 18.

111
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
Wow.

112
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,240
And everybody's watching that just going like, what the fuck just happened, man?

113
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
We just saw history.

114
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,560
And nobody even registered for a while.

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,480
They were like, that was just a really good run, man.

116
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,520
I think part of my concern is that I think I might get too into it.

117
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,560
I might enjoy watching people play video games competitively too much, but I just can't.

118
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
I can't do it.

119
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
Right, right, right.

120
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,360
I don't want to enter the territory lest I disappear into it.

121
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,560
Yeah, it's one of those things where I've never been that good at platforming games,

122
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,980
so they've always seemed like a struggle whenever I play them.

123
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,680
And then whenever you see these guys play them, it's actually a very kind of beautiful,

124
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,860
almost dancing kind of feel where it's like, oh, I get it.

125
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,120
If you just do all of the steps perfectly, it's pretty to watch.

126
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,800
It's like if you're bad at dancing and then you watch Somebody's Good, you're like, oh,

127
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
I get it.

128
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
That's what it's supposed to look like.

129
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

130
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
For sure.

131
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Yeah.

132
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,200
So something that's not how it's supposed to be is the world.

133
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Yeah.

134
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Well.

135
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Smooth.

136
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Fucking transition.

137
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
You're great.

138
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
It's a mess.

139
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
It's a mess.

140
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
And so that's why we're here on a Wednesday.

141
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
It does seem like that.

142
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,360
Doing a little special middle of the week episode, because we got to keep on top of

143
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,360
things.

144
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,080
We figured it'd be too much if we waited till Friday, things would pile up and they may

145
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
be important.

146
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,440
So we're going over January 10th and 11th today, 2021.

147
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,440
I don't have anything to say about 2021 yet.

148
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Not yet.

149
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
Nope.

150
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
We'll figure that out.

151
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,680
I think this is 2021.

152
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,840
I'm Dan and there will only be lone survivors.

153
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
No.

154
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Nope.

155
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
I feel like that one's pretty good.

156
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,760
Today we're going to be going over January 10th and 11th, 2021.

157
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
I'm Dan.

158
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
This is no longer 2020.

159
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
Oh, okay.

160
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
Nah, that's not good.

161
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
That's not that good.

162
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
Nah, it didn't feel that good.

163
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Nah, it didn't feel right.

164
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
We'll come up with something.

165
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Okay.

166
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,640
But yeah, there's a lot of, lot of horseshit on this episode.

167
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,680
And actually we get a really interesting return from somebody who's been out of pocket for

168
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,680
a while.

169
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,680
All right.

170
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,320
There's somebody who we have not heard hide nor hair of.

171
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Health Ranger?

172
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Seen?

173
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Hide nor hair of?

174
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
I'm not sure what the expression is.

175
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
Okay.

176
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Okay.

177
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
Well, we'll see what happens.

178
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
How'd you hear a hide or a hair?

179
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Yeah.

180
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
That's kind of what I was concerned about.

181
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
I'm not entirely sure.

182
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Okay.

183
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
But we'll get down to business on that here in a second.

184
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,560
But first, Jordan, we're going to take a little moment to say thank you to some folks who

185
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,240
have signed up and are supporting the show.

186
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
That's a great idea.

187
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,880
So first, don't dare call me a policy wonk.

188
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,400
You are now a policy wonk.

189
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,480
I'm a policy wonk.

190
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Take that.

191
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
Thank you.

192
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Next, Nina Z.

193
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Thank you so much.

194
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
You are now a policy wonk.

195
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,480
I'm a policy wonk.

196
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Thanks, Nina.

197
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Thank you.

198
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Next, Finn B. Not Finn Balor.

199
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Thank you so much.

200
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
You are now a policy wonk.

201
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
I'm a policy wonk.

202
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
Thanks, Finn.

203
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,480
Next, Tom K. And it's T-H-O-M, which I enjoy quite a bit.

204
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Oh, okay.

205
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
So it's not Tom Kenny?

206
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
No.

207
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Oh, damn.

208
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
Tom K., you are now a policy wonk.

209
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
I'm a policy wonk.

210
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Thank you.

211
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
Thanks, Tom K.

212
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
I like that thom.

213
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
Yeah.

214
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
Yeah.

215
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
I don't know why.

216
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
You don't know why?

217
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,840
If I were Thomas and I went by Tom, I'd definitely keep that H in there.

218
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,800
You'd like the old English H in there.

219
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Yeah.

220
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
I enjoy it.

221
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Okay.

222
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Next, Michelle H. Thank you so much.

223
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
You are now a policy wonk.

224
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
I'm a policy wonk.

225
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Thank you. Next, Snug Doo with Rob Doo, which I think is the new morning show on Infowars.

226
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Okay.

227
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,160
You are now a policy wonk.

228
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
I'm a policy wonk.

229
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Thank you.

230
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Thank you.

231
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,600
And then finally, I'd like to thank a couple of people who donated on an elevated level.

232
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,760
I appreciate that very much.

233
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,160
So, the Giuliani Brain Trust.

234
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
Thank you so much.

235
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
You are now a technocrat.

236
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,600
And Kelly M. Thank you so much.

237
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,840
You are now a technocrat.

238
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,840
I'm a policy wonk.

239
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
Crikey, mate.

240
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
That's fantastic.

241
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Have yourself a brew.

242
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
How's your 401k doing, bro?

243
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
All right.

244
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,240
We got to go full tilt boogie on this Watson, all right?

245
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,720
Let's just get down to business.

246
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,800
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

247
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,720
Why are you pimps so good?

248
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,360
My neck is freakishly large.

249
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,080
I declare Infowar on you.

250
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,720
Thank you so much, Giuliani Brain Trust, and thank you, Kelly M.

251
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Yes.

252
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Thank you very much to the both of you.

253
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,120
We have another special little shout out to give today.

254
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
All right.

255
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,000
And first, I'd like to give a shout out to Wednesday and Biscuits, who are a couple of

256
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
cats.

257
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh, okay.

258
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,360
That are just apparently adorable.

259
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
They're very sweet.

260
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
Oh, okay.

261
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
I got you.

262
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,600
But I'll take the owner's word for them.

263
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
And here's the thing.

264
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,360
I would also give a shout out to the concept of Wednesday and to Biscuits.

265
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,480
I prefer Biscuits to Wednesdays.

266
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
That's fair.

267
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Biscuits are great.

268
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Oh, you ever go...

269
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,880
First of all, Cheddar Bay Biscuits, fantastic.

270
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Wrong.

271
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,480
Second best biscuit I think is Cracker Barrel.

272
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
They have great biscuits.

273
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
That's pretty great.

274
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Oh, buttermilk.

275
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,520
That's pretty great.

276
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,720
So Wednesday and Biscuits are a couple of cats, and the people who take care of them,

277
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,800
I guess feed them, house them, are Kara and Andrew.

278
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Okay.

279
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,240
And I got reached out to because at the end of last year, two of them tied the knot.

280
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Oh, congratulations.

281
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Got married.

282
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,280
Congratulations to the both of them.

283
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:40,520
And I got a message hoping for a happy one month anniversary message in December.

284
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
We can't do that.

285
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Missed that message.

286
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
No, we don't do that.

287
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Missed that message.

288
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,760
In December, we didn't speak to anyone.

289
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
No.

290
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,000
I feel very bad about that though, so I want to make it up and wish a happy two month anniversary

291
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,720
to Kara and Andrew.

292
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,040
Happy anniversary to you both.

293
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Ah, man.

294
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,960
You should have hung onto it for a full year.

295
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,520
In December, we could have been like, ha!

296
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,400
You thought we forgot, assholes!

297
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Happy one year anniversary!

298
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,800
See, now the problem with that is I almost certainly would have forgotten.

299
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,680
We would absolutely have forgotten.

300
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,680
Yeah.

301
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
I doubt the internet will be around at the end of this year.

302
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,080
Give Wednesday and Biscuits some treats to celebrate.

303
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,320
Hope you all are having a great day.

304
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Indeed.

305
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,360
Hey Jordan, today, let's start here on January 10th.

306
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,440
Alex seems to be looking at the world and he's seeing like, hey, a lot of people are

307
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,160
saying I'm right about stuff now.

308
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Oh, that's not good.

309
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
They shouldn't do that.

310
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,000
The internet is really waking up, meaning the people are really waking up, and the saying

311
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:49,200
Alex Jones was right is being written on the walls, spray painted on the government buildings,

312
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,960
festooned to people's t-shirts and typed in to Twitter and Facebook accounts by the millions

313
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,200
a day.

314
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
And it's become a maxim.

315
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:05,320
And I'm very honored that the fact that I predicted all of this and now we're getting

316
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,680
the credit for it only because I want people to then realize that we know what's coming

317
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
next.

318
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,880
Uh, probably nuking a city is what he's going to predict, but, uh, I too would be honored

319
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:23,000
to have, uh, uh, Jordan was right directly next to, for a good time called Clarice.

320
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,840
I think that would give me a lot of honor, you know, that would make me feel good.

321
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,840
I think Alex is just responding to the fact that a bunch of people got kicked off social

322
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
media.

323
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
That would make sense.

324
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,960
And he's like, yeah, I told you they're going to kick you off social media if you keep behaving

325
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,000
in the ways that gay people kicked off social media.

326
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,520
Oh, what an amazing prediction.

327
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:47,240
Um, I think that I personally would never like to be in a situation where I'm celebrating

328
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,320
something that I said or did, uh, being memorialized in a way that I decided to call it festooned.

329
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

330
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
That's not good.

331
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,200
If you ever catch me slipping and I use that term to be like, my words are festooned on

332
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,200
billboards, uh, I'm not doing well.

333
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Things have gone bad.

334
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,040
My words emanate from the excrement of the ground, Dan.

335
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
Oh boy.

336
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
Yeah.

337
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,520
But, uh, you know, he's, uh, claimed, uh, on our previous episodes, Alex has, uh, laid

338
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,120
out the, the, uh, the foundation for the Antifa did the storming of the Capitol.

339
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Yeah, that's great.

340
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,280
I like, uh, I like getting people killed who had nothing to do with it and, uh, it's your

341
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
fault.

342
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
Sure.

343
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,600
And now Alex is, uh, he's proved it.

344
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Oh, good.

345
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
He's good.

346
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Hear that.

347
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Let me hear it.

348
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,280
That's the globalist that maneuvered us to destruction.

349
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,440
We slipped Trump in there.

350
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:44,400
He valiantly fought to at least keep the country sovereign and now they hired provocateurs.

351
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
We've proven this.

352
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,640
We have a report coming up at the end of the hour with all the evidence, two out of a million

353
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:57,480
demonstrators at the white house, the elliptical, the Washington monument stretched all the

354
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:04,840
way down to the Capitol, some other paramilitary groups were still identifying, showed up,

355
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,160
attacked the police.

356
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,100
And then the police on the other sides of the Capitol opened it up to the general public.

357
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,160
There was very little violence, very little attacks, except for a few people that were

358
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:23,480
provocateurs and who they were able to manipulate to go along with them, some useful idiots.

359
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,200
They videotaped with antifa camera people we've identified in every case, the National

360
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:35,240
Geographic camera people, the few violent events to then say that the Capitol was stormed

361
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:42,760
by terrorists, quote, and then the Capitol has fallen to the Patriots, Joe Biden end

362
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
quote.

363
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Yeah.

364
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
I don't know.

365
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,300
We just see the laying out of the narrative here.

366
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,300
And that is basically that, okay, you, so you had antifa, they started things off these

367
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,960
provocateurs and they were working with some other shade, a shadowy group, uh, was the,

368
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,160
the big, tough guys that the skinny Jean folks had hired.

369
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,280
Um, sure.

370
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,600
It's all just provocateur stuff to make us look bad, man.

371
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,520
So what's going to happen at the next one?

372
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, Alex is warning that, uh, there's going to be a lot more.

373
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,640
He's basically at this point been like, all right, they set us up.

374
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,280
It was all fake, but also I'm fucking out.

375
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,480
Oh yeah.

376
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,320
He was planning on going to the inauguration and now he's like, hell no.

377
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Well that's smart.

378
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
That's smart.

379
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Yeah.

380
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
That is very smart.

381
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Yeah.

382
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
He's, he's changed his tone quite a bit.

383
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
It's a, it's all like, oh no, no, no.

384
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
Isn't that, isn't that a surprise?

385
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
They're all going to be setups in the future.

386
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
So wild.

387
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,120
So wild how he would completely change his tone the moment he got exactly what he wanted

388
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,120
and now realizes it's time to, uh, time to pivot.

389
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
Yeah.

390
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Time to pivot.

391
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
Hmm.

392
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,640
Uh, but you know, Hey, there's a lot of other folks who are, uh, are coming out here and

393
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:53,560
uh, you know, they're, uh, making some, uh, some insightful inciting claims and statements.

394
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
All right.

395
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,520
So you have all these leftists, all these members of Congress, and I've got their quotes

396
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
right here.

397
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,320
We'll play some of the clips at the moment.

398
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,500
Ted Lou threatened widespread civil unrest.

399
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,200
We need to see some fires.

400
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,520
So Alex is referring to a 32nd clip of Ted Lou from, uh, 2018 where he's being interviewed

401
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,400
by Chris Hayes on MSNBC and is discussing the potential firing of Robert Mueller.

402
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Not fires.

403
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
Fuck you.

404
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Fuck you.

405
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,960
He doesn't call for fires and he doesn't actually call for anything.

406
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,880
He just says that if Trump fires Mueller, it would likely lead to civil unrest and protest.

407
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Great.

408
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
That's not a threat.

409
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,920
But that's how the comment and stuff like this is reported on Infowars.

410
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
No, no, no.

411
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,300
If somebody says this is the logical result of what this person does, they're like, see,

412
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,800
Mueller telling them to do it.

413
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Yeah.

414
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
And you're like, God damn it, guys.

415
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
You're stupid.

416
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Yeah.

417
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,080
So also Alex has found an Antifa leader, uh, that, uh, he's going to, uh, pinpoint as the,

418
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,160
uh, the, the villain of January 6th.

419
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,680
And I have an Antifa leader that was one of the first to break in who said, we're going

420
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,320
to go there and pose as patriots as Trump supporters.

421
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,120
And we're going to burn the Capitol down.

422
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,680
He said it in Utah, where he lives, where he's been arrested and charged for inciting

423
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,800
riot before.

424
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,280
We'll show you who he is.

425
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:19,520
He said it in DC the day before the event in a speech to Antifa, who was then getting

426
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:31,560
into manga outfits in the Capitol, he was arrested, but then they dropped the charges

427
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,280
on him because he did a good job.

428
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,420
This supposed Antifa leader Alex is talking about is a guy named John Sullivan.

429
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,420
He's not an Antifa leader.

430
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,360
I don't know what that means, but he's, uh, he is somebody who's had some history and

431
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,900
involvement in anti-fascist and social justice activism.

432
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,360
Sullivan was one of the people who was there and was recording the storming of the Capitol,

433
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,400
supposedly as an independent journalist, documenting history, PolitiFact reviewed his footage.

434
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,900
And there are some questions about how disconnected from the story he managed to be with him occasionally

435
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,480
seeming to express encouragement about what was going on around him.

436
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,560
But that's a far cry from the accusations that people like Alex are making as an independent

437
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,920
journalist who agrees with all of what you guys are doing.

438
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,500
I would like you to continue storming the Capitol building.

439
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,920
And somehow I'm the bad guy here.

440
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
What are you talking about?

441
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,800
The way it looks is that Sullivan is a bit of a bad player in the game.

442
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,600
He probably felt like he was doing an impartial piece of journalism documenting a monumental

443
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,200
moment, but he didn't show the poise and discipline to actually pull that role off.

444
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,840
That's what it appears like to me.

445
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,520
He said that some of his encouraging words were meant to help him blend in and that very

446
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,400
well may be the case, and I think that's what Alex is talking about with him, like we're

447
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,360
going to pretend to be MAGA people, like you do want to blend in with the crowd.

448
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,440
Yeah, I mean they will tear you limb from limb.

449
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,040
They did have that kind of Scrum vibe to them.

450
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
Scrum.

451
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Yeah.

452
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,860
Whatever the case, it's nonsense to take whatever dubious behavior Sullivan may have shown on

453
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,520
January 6th and take it as proof that he was somehow an Antifa leader who was responsible

454
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,340
for the storming of the Capitol.

455
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,640
That is what I would call a desperate attempt to scapegoat.

456
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,680
Yeah, that's not good.

457
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,580
I can't find confirmation that he's been arrested in relation to the Capitol storming, but he

458
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:13,840
is facing charges related to an earlier protest in Utah that is still going through the courts.

459
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,680
So as far as I can tell, Alex is just making up the part about him having charges and them

460
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:23,000
being dropped related to this, and he's doing that because of things like what Joel Skousen

461
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
said on our last episode, that is if the provocateurs themselves get arrested, they'll be let off

462
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,040
because they're in on it with the authorities.

463
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,720
And that's just sort of building up that narrative, but I can't find any evidence of that.

464
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,240
I still don't understand how they're getting around the fact that, regardless, fuck it,

465
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,980
say Antifa did the whole thing.

466
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,400
You guys do still realize that they only followed because it's what they want to do and what

467
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,920
you told them to do.

468
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,280
Well, there's a couple of thoughts on this, actually, that come up over the course of

469
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
this.

470
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Okay.

471
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,560
I think hypnotism may be involved.

472
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,960
You know, I should have seen that one coming.

473
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
Mass hypnosis.

474
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
That's what it was.

475
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Yep.

476
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Shit.

477
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
So it turns out...

478
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,640
You just red-pilled me is what it turns out.

479
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,220
Alex has, I was trying to figure out a way to talk about, like, come up with a pill,

480
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,640
but it's just a jelly bean.

481
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,640
Never mind.

482
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,640
Okay.

483
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,800
I'm kind of understanding here that he's, like, proven everything.

484
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Like, everything is...

485
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
We got this, man.

486
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Sure.

487
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Sure.

488
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,800
It was Antifa.

489
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
Easy.

490
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
And an unnamed fake militia.

491
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Done and done.

492
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
That was going around.

493
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
They're working with the feds.

494
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,240
We just finished, right before the show went live today, a very powerful special report

495
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,600
that details the false flag, how Antifa staged it with some other shadowy paramilitary groups

496
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
that we're starting to identify.

497
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,600
That'll be in a report tomorrow, because they got to have a right-wing chair group as well.

498
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,640
So when it comes out, they can blame both groups.

499
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,720
This is about coming out for everybody's liberties.

500
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,240
So this is how it goes.

501
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,720
This is the way that you explain the fact that there were groups that look almost exactly

502
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
like your buddies.

503
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Yeah.

504
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Yep.

505
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
Yeah.

506
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,580
I mean, you might as well just come out and say, if we'd won, I'm happy that the Patriots

507
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,440
won, and since we lost, it was all Antifa.

508
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Just say that.

509
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
Since the bottom fell out.

510
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Yeah.

511
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
That is not us.

512
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,560
Now that it turns out everybody doesn't like this, it wasn't us.

513
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Guess what?

514
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,840
We get it both ways.

515
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,040
Coming, going, forward, backward.

516
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
We get it.

517
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
Yeah.

518
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
It's fine.

519
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
We're white.

520
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,880
So the narrative here is being set, and it's fairly well said, I think, by Alex at this

521
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,240
point that it was just these other people.

522
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
It's not...

523
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

524
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,440
Not me.

525
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Not Trump.

526
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,480
Who could pull some sort of visual and audio evidence of me doing exactly the thing that

527
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,800
I'm saying that I never did.

528
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,960
It's all the deep state, and the deep state has a bunch of tendrils, and some of them

529
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,080
are Antifa.

530
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,000
Q is also deep state.

531
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
How about Harrison Smith?

532
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Is he deep state?

533
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,960
No, but he wasn't actually even on air.

534
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
That was a deep fake.

535
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Oh.

536
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,840
That was a big deep fake.

537
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,040
Whoever made that was good.

538
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,960
They must have been working on that one for a long time.

539
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,520
And he just pretends that...

540
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,280
I haven't heard Alex talk about that broadcast at all.

541
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,280
Oh, that's unsurprising.

542
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
Yeah.

543
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Yeah.

544
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,480
But look, so you have those deep state actors in the form of Q, Antifa.

545
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,560
But there was another group there, and that was the Trump folks.

546
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,360
And you might be surprised to find out what they were up to.

547
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Okay.

548
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,800
This was meant to bring in the 25th Amendment, the impeachment of Trump, but it failed because

549
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:52,240
unlike any other football fans, or basketball fans, or liberals, or whoever, even though

550
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,200
they had hundreds of paid provocateurs trying to riot, trying to lead this, instead of the

551
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,880
Trump supporters, now we have dozens of these videos, were kicking their ass when they attacked

552
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,940
the cops and tried to break in the windows.

553
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,340
But they got overwhelmed.

554
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:11,000
So now the narrative is becoming that Trump's people tried to fight off Antifa and Q folks

555
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,520
who were trying to storm the counter.

556
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
All right.

557
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
All right.

558
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,600
This is bullshit, get the fuck out of my face forever.

559
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,320
I'm done speaking to anybody who's like, no, no, no, that's what happened.

560
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,120
Not only did Trump supporters not try and take over the whole fucking country, but they

561
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,940
actually tried to stop the takeover of the whole country.

562
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,960
If you say that to me, I will never speak to you again.

563
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,980
Love the constitution in America so much that they were willing to stand up and fight against

564
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:45,620
these malevolent communist invading forces like Q and Han people and Antifa in order

565
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,280
to protect the Capitol building that they respect so much.

566
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,360
Say it to my face.

567
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,360
Say it to my face.

568
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,440
I've talked to real army intelligence, highest levels, I'm not going to say the names of

569
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,880
the groups, everybody knows the highest level the army is, army special operations, Delta

570
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
Force, all that.

571
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,280
I mean, we had live feeds of that when we were there.

572
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,320
They're not like magic people, they're just like us, but they concur.

573
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,080
This was a failed false flag, pipe bombs found outside.

574
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,840
It was meant to be hundreds dead, hostages taken, Q-tards believing it all, Q-tards can

575
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,160
say they were going to go take hostages online, but they didn't because the simulation broke

576
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,920
down once they actually got there in the real world, it didn't happen.

577
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,680
A lot of it because patriots fought them off and stopped them.

578
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,440
So an alliance of Q-tards with Antifa and some shadowy synthetic militia group, the

579
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,240
feds control is what we now know.

580
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,840
So that's, hey, look, that's quite a showdown.

581
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
Yeah.

582
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
Quite a showdown.

583
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,840
Yeah.

584
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
Oh boy.

585
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,840
Yeah.

586
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
People still doing the tards.

587
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
Yeah, I don't like that at all.

588
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,360
I don't like that at all.

589
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,280
No, and it's kind of interesting that Alex seems to have given himself the green light

590
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,440
to say that a lot about Q-folks.

591
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,600
And I think that there's a real sense that he's realized this is not profitable for me

592
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,920
at all anymore.

593
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:05,000
Great way to throw them under the bus and I can maybe get some of the people back and

594
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,740
at the same time, you know what it feels like to me?

595
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:16,440
It feels like the relationship between Alex and Glenn Beck in like 2009, but in reverse.

596
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Yeah, yeah.

597
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,440
Now Alex is...

598
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
I'm not Q.

599
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
At least I'm not Q.

600
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
Yeah, yeah.

601
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
You can hire me for Fox News.

602
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,440
I'm better than some of your fucking hosts.

603
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,880
Yeah, exactly.

604
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,880
Glenn Beck got a lot of mileage and legitimacy out of being like, I'm not Alex Jones.

605
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
At least I'm not him.

606
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Yeah.

607
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,160
And now Alex has Q to point to.

608
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,320
He's finally freed himself up to do that.

609
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,440
That's disgusting.

610
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,680
And I think that it actually works on some people.

611
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,340
You saw flying around on Twitter all these people being like, I can't believe Alex Jones

612
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,340
denounced Q.

613
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
Oh, totally.

614
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,960
Because it's an effective thing to have some other thing that's farther and more extreme

615
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,720
than you that you can point to and be like, you know you hate that more.

616
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

617
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
Get some heat off you.

618
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,880
Everybody's acting like the tide just came in and everybody's moving up a level and it's

619
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,880
unacceptable and I won't fucking allow it.

620
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,880
No.

621
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,880
No.

622
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
No.

623
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,840
So, after this storming of the Capitol, you know, a lot of people have had some soul searching.

624
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,320
They've had some people asking difficult questions.

625
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
Sure.

626
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,040
And, you know, a lot of conversation has gone around about like what it would actually even

627
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,200
mean and what it would take to be together as a country again.

628
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,560
Like unite and Alex is afraid about truth and reconciliation committees.

629
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,580
Yeah, I would say we're probably gonna have to do something along the lines of the end

630
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,600
of World War II combined with de-bathification or, yeah, something like a better version

631
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,040
of that for all the white supremacists in our goddamn...

632
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,940
I don't know if you've heard, but John Brennan has called for truth and reconciliation committees.

633
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,380
Has he?

634
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,040
He would get fucked up if there were real truth and reconciliation committees.

635
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,860
If there were 100% real ones, we would be fucking decapitating Brennan.

636
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,400
So I doubt he's calling for that shit.

637
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,400
There would be some truth and some reconciliation coming of both directions.

638
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Brutal.

639
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Brutal shit to him.

640
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,520
By the way, Brennan has now said if you were a talk show host, a member of Congress, you

641
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,240
must come to communist reconciliation things on TV and say you're bad.

642
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,820
But once you do that, then things really collapse.

643
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,020
People cannot do this.

644
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,600
They're following a tried and true communist takeover.

645
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,960
I think that Alex is misreading a headline here.

646
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
Oh, yeah?

647
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,120
So John Brennan didn't say that there needed to be reconciliation.

648
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
Unsurprising.

649
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,480
But I think I found the quote he's talking about.

650
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,480
Okay.

651
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,160
I'll tell you that there can only be reconciliation with repentance.

652
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,740
And I think the single most important thing that Republicans in Congress who helped facilitate

653
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,640
this widespread conspiracy theory that somehow the election was stolen and the most important

654
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,440
thing that Donald Trump can do in those remaining 10 days is to stop those lies and to persuade

655
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,360
their followers and supporters that the president elect Biden is the duly elected president

656
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
of the United States.

657
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,360
Great.

658
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,520
That was said by Senator Chris Coons on Sunday's edition of Face the Nation.

659
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,320
I think that Alex just skimmed a headline that mentioned reconciliation and the host

660
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,520
of Face the Nation, whose name is Margaret Brennan.

661
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,600
I would bet that Alex saw the name Brennan and decided that it was John Brennan calling

662
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,280
for communist style reconciliation committees.

663
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,640
Dan, Dan, it is infuriating to me that that happened.

664
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,680
And two, that you're good enough to figure out exactly what happened.

665
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,560
I think that's a frustrating truth.

666
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,880
I think that's what happened.

667
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
It's totally what happened.

668
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,240
It seems on brand for him.

669
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
100% what happened.

670
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,420
To see the name Brennan and just assume instead of the host of Face the Nation.

671
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,880
You are inside his mind to a terrifying degree.

672
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,760
You're fucking Hannibal Lecter, Dan.

673
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,240
You're Hannibal Lecter, and he's the guy from Red Dragon or whatever.

674
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Um, maybe.

675
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,240
Yeah.

676
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,280
I don't like to cook though, or at least I'm not good at it.

677
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,880
Hannibal but for frozen pizzas.

678
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,520
To be fair, I have no evidence that Hannibal is good at cooking.

679
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
That's fair.

680
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
Yeah.

681
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,800
And there's no like reviews of his cooking.

682
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:01,520
Well, I mean, you have to have some sort of talent to cook a brain and eat it to the person.

683
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,200
Yeah, I guess so.

684
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,160
And pair it with wine.

685
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,400
So, Barnes comes in.

686
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,520
Barnes drops by, and his entire appearance here on this Sunday episode, this January

687
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,080
10th episode, is that, hey, Q sucks.

688
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,160
Just there to beat up on Q.

689
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
Great.

690
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,120
Um, and so he describes it as a psy-op, which I have some questions about.

691
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,120
Okay.

692
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,320
This is the most dangerous time in the history of our constitutional republic.

693
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,880
It faces more risk than it did, frankly, in 1860.

694
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,920
That's the kind of threat that they want to impose by ramrodding, using the pretext of

695
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:49,160
this staged event that was heavily facilitated by a psy-op operation of QAnon and with infiltrators

696
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,440
and instigators involved as well.

697
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,360
So the thing that I run into, and I hear this, they're like QAnon is a psy-op.

698
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,800
One of the things that really fueled it lately, and in the last year at least, has been Donald

699
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:08,540
Trump retweeting QAnon accounts, and Donald Trump himself giving tacit acknowledgement

700
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,920
of and support of this because it, you know, narcissistically feeds his ego or whatever.

701
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:19,000
So I have to ask if Trump is running a psy-op on himself.

702
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,400
Is Trump running a psy-op on you, Robert Barnes?

703
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,120
I think what's obvious is that Trump is Antifa, Dan.

704
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
Oh, shit.

705
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:31,640
And that's why Antifa, that's who really fucking Antifa-ed us at the Capitol building.

706
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,640
Right.

707
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:40,360
Who, if Antifa inspired the attack, the only answer, Dan, is Trump is a black bloc.

708
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,360
Sure.

709
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,760
So you had those people there who were looking real mighty scary.

710
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:51,760
You know, at the Capitol, you had the looky-loo types, the people who were maybe just there

711
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,520
to take pictures of themselves.

712
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
Right.

713
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
Foot fetishists of AOC.

714
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,520
Sure.

715
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

716
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
And then you had terrifying people.

717
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Right.

718
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,520
And the terrifying...

719
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,520
Like the foot fetishists of AOC?

720
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
Okay.

721
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,920
Well, they're terrifying in a different way.

722
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
Yeah.

723
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,080
You had the real militia-trained looking type people.

724
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
Right, right, right.

725
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,220
And so in order to explain this, Alex has already said that this is some militia that's

726
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:21,680
working with the feds, but now we get to pivot that over and like, that's what the Q people

727
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
were.

728
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Yeah.

729
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Right?

730
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
Sure.

731
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,680
So that explains everything.

732
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
God, I hate this.

733
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,680
Because there were people there with zip ties.

734
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,380
They arrested one of them in Nashville.

735
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,000
So there are people there that had ulterior agendas that misled other people who were

736
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,520
partaking, who didn't realize what was happening.

737
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,560
Well, they told them, we're Q secret agents under Trump's orders and we're going to go

738
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
in there.

739
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,940
And then now I heard that day one, oh, they told them they were about to get Pelosi and

740
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,940
grab the proof.

741
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,720
And then sure enough, oh, there's experts, oh, this was done for special ops to get Pelosi's

742
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
laptop.

743
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,620
I mean, this is so scripted, folks.

744
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,840
If you're online, you pledge allegiance to some made up letter of the alphabet, and then

745
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,720
it tells you to go take over the White House or the Capitol or whatever, you're being set

746
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,360
up for death, just like Arlington Road.

747
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,920
Go see Arlington Road.

748
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,040
If you're talking about the people that pledge allegiance to Q being stupid, I would ask

749
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,800
you what about General Flynn and his family?

750
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
Sure.

751
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,460
They posted a video of themselves pledging allegiance to Q and saying, where we go one

752
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,460
we go all.

753
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,300
Nah, nah, they were manipulating the deep state into thinking that the deep state had

754
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,660
manipulated them into believing what the deep state says.

755
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:34,840
And that way they can run this counter, counter, counter, counter coup, which is going on right

756
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,320
now, after the first coup from...

757
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,520
I'm so tired, Dan, I'm just so goddamn tired.

758
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,080
They also posted that video of themselves pledging allegiance to Q on the Fourth of

759
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,080
July.

760
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,800
Explain to me what exactly you think is the difference between pledging allegiance to

761
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,680
Q and pledging allegiance to Trump.

762
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
Not much.

763
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
No.

764
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,680
Not much.

765
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,240
I don't see too much difference between that and pledging allegiance to a fucking flag.

766
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,360
What are we doing pledging allegiance to shit, Dan?

767
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,720
Let's not dissect that now, but I agree, patriotism can go astray.

768
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,920
So Robert Barnes apparently works for Trump, apparently.

769
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
Sure why not?

770
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
I don't know if that's true.

771
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,280
No other lawyer will work for him anymore.

772
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,120
I don't know if that's true and I don't care, because there are ethical problems whether

773
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,440
it's true or not, like, it's still like, he still should be disbarred for his behavior.

774
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,440
Oh yeah.

775
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,440
Oh yeah.

776
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
But he...

777
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,800
Is Larry Klaiman free for this one?

778
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
He might be.

779
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
He might be.

780
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
He might not be able to practice.

781
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
I hope not.

782
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
I hope not.

783
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,320
But Barnes, I just love this.

784
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,440
We heard this before and I just wanted to play it because it happened again.

785
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,120
Alex being like, he works for Trump, he doesn't want me to tell you that.

786
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,920
All right, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to lay out my curriculum vitae or my

787
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,680
27 years of the fight, but I am true to America.

788
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:57,360
I make mistakes, but I believe in human justice and freedom and promote it.

789
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,840
Robert Barnes does not even want it known that he's worked for Trump for months during

790
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,920
this election fraud, battling at the highest levels or that talks to Trump on a routine

791
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,920
basis.

792
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,800
But we're going to put that out now because we're 10 days out from the inauguration of

793
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Biden.

794
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
So...

795
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
You're not putting that out now.

796
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
You've put that out a bunch already.

797
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

798
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
A whole bunch.

799
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
A whole bunch.

800
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
You're not good at keeping secrets.

801
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
No.

802
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Especially when they're made up bullshit.

803
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Right.

804
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Or when they're true.

805
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,560
True and ethically very not good.

806
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:29,960
I don't know too many lawyers who would be like, okay, my client is the president of

807
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,960
the United States.

808
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,960
Right.

809
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,120
I think it's a good idea for me to have a radio show with Alex Jones.

810
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,880
Yeah, it's a good idea for me to moonlight as a pro-Trump propagandist.

811
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,920
I don't think that is good for the legal profession.

812
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
It's iffy.

813
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Yeah.

814
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:53,560
So Barnes, I will say, you know, just looking at everything purely, you know, take morals,

815
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,880
take just everything out of it.

816
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
Sure.

817
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,640
He has some accurate points that he makes about QAnon, which, oh, shocking.

818
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,440
A lot of people have been saying for a while.

819
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
Yeah.

820
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,120
The first thing that he says is not really one of those.

821
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,300
He talks about how this is a brilliant psy-op, which I take issue with some of that.

822
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,880
But he has some other points that I think are pretty good.

823
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,420
Q is a brilliant disinformation campaign that is unique.

824
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:25,260
If you look at other message boards and anon posters that claim to be government agents

825
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,360
on those message boards, they do not communicate in the way Q did.

826
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,360
So people who study disinformation campaigns very early on were telling me this was not

827
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,600
just a sort of conspiracy theorist of people going down a rabbit hole on a random message

828
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
board.

829
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,580
This was showing signs of a sophisticated disinformation psy-ops campaign being run

830
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,960
by somebody with institutional influence and backing.

831
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,880
I do think that there is a point to be made about how different this is than other things

832
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,880
like this.

833
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,880
Sure.

834
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,280
The message gate got to a certain point and then it fizzled out.

835
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,960
Now granted, it sort of metastasized and evolved into what this is.

836
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,960
Sure.

837
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,160
But there were a bunch of other attempts at doing something like this on message boards.

838
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,160
Right.

839
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
Right, right, right.

840
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,880
And it even goes back to earlier conspiracy times when you'd have people who would have

841
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:22,720
these, essentially, huge role-playing things where they would have like...

842
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:28,540
No, this is like an augmented reality participatory storytelling thing that a bunch of people

843
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,540
are...

844
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,740
You know, it reminds me of Gravity Falls, weirdly enough.

845
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:40,560
At the end of the cartoon, they had a little statue that was somewhere in the Pacific Northwest.

846
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,280
That's where the show was set.

847
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,400
And then a bunch of fans put together all of these clues together and wound up finding

848
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,160
out that it was actually something that they had hidden in real life, like this little

849
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,720
statue there, and they found it.

850
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,920
And it was a bunch of people all working together, finding out all of these clues to...

851
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,440
And it's functionally the same thing as Q, it's just this time there's nothing at the

852
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,800
end of the rainbow but storming the fucking Capitol building.

853
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,440
Yeah, there are some things like that that are outside of the realms of political conspiracy

854
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,440
and propaganda.

855
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

856
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,640
And then there are also versions that are conspiracy and internet message board based

857
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,360
things that could have turned into stuff like this and made it into an augmented reality

858
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,360
kind of thing.

859
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
Totally, totally.

860
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,360
But it didn't.

861
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,200
I do think that that's fair.

862
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,480
I don't think it makes sense to say that it's brilliant and institutionally supported.

863
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,760
No, I would even argue that the main reason that it works is because it's kind of stupid.

864
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,160
It's at the level of the people participating in it.

865
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,760
Yeah, and it's malleable and decentralized to an extent that you can just... anything

866
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
can be anything.

867
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,600
Yeah, which is why you don't want anybody with institutional control anywhere near it.

868
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Yeah.

869
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
You know what I said?

870
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:55,600
I think when I said that he had a good point, I think I was basically just remembering this

871
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
next clip.

872
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Yeah.

873
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,920
And that's him talking about the element of it being like a game.

874
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Yeah.

875
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,680
And a lot of people have talked about that, about how one of the things that makes it

876
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:10,680
so insidious is the way in which there's like, you're involved in this, in the way that that

877
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,840
Gravity Falls thing is actually a fun, immersive experience.

878
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:20,220
This is a false carrot in front of you on a pole.

879
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,280
Some people catch Pokemon on the corner and some people find out that there's a secret

880
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,760
conspiracy on the corner.

881
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,160
It's the same fucking shit.

882
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,120
And Barnes is now talking about that, but it's something that other people have been

883
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,920
talking about and warning about for a long time.

884
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,800
Since the beginning of the fucking thing.

885
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:42,080
And these people, like Alex and like Infowars, were perfectly happy to, I guess, ignore any

886
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,840
of these warnings to the extent that this was possibly profitable.

887
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,120
Let's see if we can exploit some of it.

888
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,080
It's all just supporting Trump.

889
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,020
So like, Hey, let's let it be.

890
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,760
But now somebody's got to go onto the bus and it's going to be Q and A.

891
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
Yeah.

892
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,080
They would, let's say they were trying to find something in a scavenger hunt and that's

893
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
what it was.

894
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
It was part fiction, part reality.

895
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,360
And they went to a real house where something was hidden or a clue was located for them

896
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,640
to find the next clue.

897
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,040
Well, they would go there and they would find, say three pieces of wood, all pointed at a

898
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,680
particular part of the wall.

899
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,360
And they'd be like, Oh, that can't be a coincidence.

900
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,160
It must be something behind that wall.

901
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,600
When in fact it was purely coincidental.

902
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
They were seeing patterns that did not exist.

903
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:28,200
Well, what QAnon brilliantly did was use the questioning technique without ever giving

904
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:35,000
answers, use vagueness and ambiguity while appearing to give specific secrets to, because

905
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,320
with Pokemon Go and others, you shift into the VR, VR is a fake template over reality.

906
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,080
So, you know, reality's real.

907
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,000
You're in a garage, you're in a gutter, you're on top of building.

908
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,280
But then they found people, if they told them there was a bridge off a building, someone

909
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,720
would just jump off the building because suddenly there was a bridge there in their overlay

910
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,920
through the Pokemon Go.

911
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,920
That's exactly right.

912
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,840
I know that they think that there's a substantial difference between what they do and what their

913
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,360
describing and I don't think that there is.

914
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,360
There's none.

915
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,360
I know that, you know, factually there's a difference between saying there's a bridge

916
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:16,200
in front of you and then you jump and you fall, but Alex just tells people that headlines

917
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,160
mean something and he has never read the article.

918
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,000
It's the same, it's the same amount of faith that's being demanded of.

919
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,480
He's sufficiently vague about his predictions.

920
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,200
He gives you secrets that aren't really real.

921
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Yeah.

922
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,160
Basically everything he's describing.

923
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,160
Yeah.

924
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,160
Yeah.

925
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:38,160
You know, like I used to have bigger teeth, but now I just grind them every time we do

926
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
this show.

927
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
So now they're much smaller.

928
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
You don't even have teeth anymore.

929
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,160
I don't even have teeth.

930
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,720
I just have ground down nubs.

931
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:52,040
So it turns out Alex, a couple months back, had threatened to reveal who Q is because

932
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
he knows all of it.

933
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
Yes, of course.

934
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
He never did do that.

935
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,560
It was all just probably an attempt to get attention.

936
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,560
Yeah.

937
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,400
So this conversation becomes even sillier knowing that he's pretended that he knows

938
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,800
who Q is and he can expose all of it.

939
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
Right.

940
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:15,000
Because apparently, I don't know if you know this, Q tried to enlist Robert Barnes.

941
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
All right.

942
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I hate everyone.

943
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,720
And they targeted people who they thought would otherwise be potential active sources

944
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,960
of support for crowdsourcing Trump support.

945
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,480
So they looked at people who did independent investigative journalism.

946
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Explain this.

947
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,320
They actually approached you, and I don't know if you want to get into this, but not

948
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,560
at the Q level, but above that, we're the intel group and we're with Q because again,

949
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,520
they give you a virtual reality where you actually think you're fighting for freedom,

950
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,520
but you're working for them.

951
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,520
Exactly.

952
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
Okay.

953
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:57,200
So now Barnes, if you are agreeing with Alex when he says that Q tried to enlist you, it

954
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,960
now is your all's responsibility to be like, who the fuck are you talking about?

955
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
Who are you talking about?

956
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Provide us the name.

957
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,160
You've already said you can throw them under the bus.

958
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
Yeah, exactly.

959
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,440
You could clear up a whole lot, Alex, if you wanted to.

960
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,960
Oh, if you hate them so much.

961
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,360
I fucking hate these people.

962
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,000
Yeah, they're terrible.

963
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,200
So Alex gets a little bit of breaking news in the middle of this broadcast, and it's

964
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
not breaking news.

965
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,760
That police officer, the Capitol Police, who died by suicide, Alex has decided to turn

966
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
that into a conspiracy.

967
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,760
Sure.

968
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,760
All right.

969
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,760
This is breaking news.

970
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,680
I'm not ready to give all of it out yet.

971
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,400
I'll do it next segment because I've got one more question from our sources, but we have

972
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,240
this from inside the DC Police Department.

973
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,720
There has been a high level suicide of one of the deputy police chiefs.

974
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,200
I'll leave it at that.

975
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,600
They're trying to cover it up.

976
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,920
We don't know if it's actually a cover up.

977
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,120
They may have killed them in the DC Capitol Police.

978
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:59,880
So Alex is turning this police officer's death into a story where he is said to have committed

979
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:05,680
suicide, but it might be a murder because he happens to be the cop who told these cops

980
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,400
to stand down and allow Antifa to attack the Capitol.

981
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:15,000
So he's basically cast this guy in this role, and it's just disgusting.

982
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,520
I can't imagine being anywhere near someone who was affected by the Capitol building like

983
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,360
that without like instantly being like, does anybody have a template for how to sue Alex

984
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,360
Jones?

985
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,360
Oh yeah.

986
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,360
There should be at this point.

987
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,840
I haven't heard him say anything yet, but does anybody have like a Mad Libs for the

988
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,120
way Alex Jones is going to need to be sued for this?

989
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:44,920
There should be like a whole section on legal zoom just dedicated to suing Alex for the

990
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
right shit.

991
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
Yeah.

992
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,920
Yeah.

993
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,760
There's a dropdown menu and they'll fill in the rest for you.

994
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,760
Yeah.

995
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,840
It's like, if I were this guy's family, I can't imagine what I would be like how pissed

996
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:02,640
off I would be if you trying to imply that someone I cared about who I just lost just

997
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
days ago.

998
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,640
You fucking killed.

999
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,640
Yeah.

1000
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:11,480
He, uh, it was, he, you know, it's all suspicious in a conspiracy because he ordered to stand

1001
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,480
down.

1002
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,480
Like go fuck yourself, man.

1003
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
No.

1004
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
How cruel.

1005
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,640
Keep his fucking name out of your mouth.

1006
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,960
I'm not even saying the dude's name out of respect.

1007
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,960
Absolutely not.

1008
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,200
So anyway, Barnes, uh, is still on and he thinks that, uh, that whole thing where everybody

1009
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,120
was like taking the pledge, like Flynn, uh, it was all a setup so they could get a conspiracy

1010
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,120
charge.

1011
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,300
So I was right about that.

1012
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,520
It's a double double kind of starting the late fall where the queue was asking people

1013
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,080
to take oaths to have the, have them broadcast videotape themselves, taking these oaths,

1014
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,200
have them broadcast other people that they were taking these oaths.

1015
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,880
Uh, and that was beginning to set up a, basically a future, uh, seditious conspiracy allegation

1016
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:57,000
against all participants and then try to motivate other ones to become more and more violent

1017
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,520
because the goal was to feel like this election was everything and whatever happened that

1018
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,180
this was the end of the world.

1019
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,680
So they had to take whatever.

1020
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,720
So they would either feel futility and frustration and fear and lash out or they would convince

1021
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,240
a portion of them that the, the insiders on the government and the insiders in the military

1022
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,200
and the insiders and the intelligence branches really wanted them to take action.

1023
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,680
How's that any different than Infowars coverage?

1024
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:26,840
Dan, I keep repeating in my head, violence is not the answer because the moment he said

1025
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:32,160
they wanted to make you feel like this election was the end of the world, the only response

1026
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,960
that I can, like I went red, like there is, there is flashing lights behind my eyes.

1027
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:47,400
No, I, I, you told me these people are run by the fucking devil and that if Trump loses,

1028
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,400
it's the end times.

1029
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,000
It's the end of all civilization.

1030
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,920
No, it's, it's not, it's not fair to treat audiences like this.

1031
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,840
You know, it's, it's not, look, violence is not the answer, but sometimes it could be

1032
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,260
part of the answer when it comes to Robert Barnes.

1033
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,260
I don't know.

1034
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:11,000
I would just get, get rid of that license of his, I think that that's the solution.

1035
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,240
You can't say that.

1036
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,240
You can't.

1037
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:19,120
I want to write one law for that word specific, just for the, not infringing upon freedoms

1038
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:24,160
of speech whatsoever, but if you say that before the election, it's the end of the world

1039
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
if you lose it.

1040
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,080
And then after the election you say, uh, these people were trying to lie to you about that.

1041
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,320
You lose something, you lose something, a foot, a hand.

1042
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,320
I don't care.

1043
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,440
Robert Barnes would just say like, I didn't say that and that may, maybe that's true.

1044
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,400
Unfortunately you worked for a news organization, quote unquote news organization that was their

1045
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,920
editorial stance and Alex screamed it on air for months.

1046
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
So I don't know.

1047
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,900
It's not even the pot calling the kettle black.

1048
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:54,000
It is just both of them are the fucking kettle and they're just arguing with each other.

1049
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Who's more kettle-y.

1050
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yeah, exactly.

1051
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,200
You're fucking both kettles.

1052
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,880
So Alex has now got confirmation, um, that, uh, this, uh, this cop who has passed away,

1053
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,560
uh, ordered the stand down and I don't know where he got this confirmation from, but based

1054
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,360
on the other news he's reporting, I'm not positive if I'm going to trust this.

1055
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,360
Let's get down to brass tacks.

1056
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,700
I have guests on that actually know stuff.

1057
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,600
We don't have to have sources.

1058
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,920
Most of the time you and I have people asking us what's going on.

1059
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,920
I don't mean that arrogantly.

1060
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,800
It's not like there's magic sources here, magic sources there.

1061
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,800
We're smart people.

1062
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,960
We've lived this, Bob.

1063
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,960
You're smart.

1064
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,680
I'm smart, but, but absolutely what you said last night is more targets.

1065
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:39,240
I have confirmed that a Capitol police supervisor, the one that ordered the stand down has committed

1066
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,240
suicide.

1067
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,760
There is an internal bulletin that at least four governors mansions in the U S have been

1068
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,840
overrun governors driven out.

1069
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,960
This is not too crap.

1070
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,960
This is real.

1071
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,220
Uh, and that there are attacks happening in governor's mansions right now, and that there

1072
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:58,780
are more attacks plan the next 24 hours, and it looks like deep States using Antifa and

1073
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:04,620
program Q tards who think they're part of an insurrection, uh, for Trump to actually

1074
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,780
bring in martial law against us all.

1075
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,840
That's why big tech is shutting Trump up ahead of actually declaring martial law that will

1076
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,360
probably kill Trump.

1077
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:18,340
So Alex is reporting that there were four unspecified governor's mansions that have

1078
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,600
been overrun and the governors have been fled.

1079
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,980
Dan, what day is today?

1080
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,280
Is the 12th we're recording this.

1081
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,800
What day did he say that 10th okay.

1082
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:33,340
How many governors were his mansions or all right, so we're, you know what happened here?

1083
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,340
I think I figured it out.

1084
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,820
So this isn't like Q no, it's not.

1085
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:40,860
It's not some kind of false reality is not at all.

1086
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,460
And he's reporting this as like in the present happening right now.

1087
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,120
I just got an internal bulletin.

1088
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,300
I can't believe they kept that quiet cause I haven't heard anything about, I think what

1089
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:56,540
he's talking about is on the sixth there were protests at capitals at governor's mansions

1090
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:03,100
and there were a couple of incidents where governors felt a threat.

1091
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:07,180
And I think that he's taking those bits of information that maybe he didn't know about

1092
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:12,020
until this point and pretending that they're happening in the immediate.

1093
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,740
That's the only thing I can think of because otherwise I would suggest if you're going

1094
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:19,880
to report that for governor's mansions have been overrun, you have a deep responsibility

1095
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:25,420
to name the States and have a little bit more fucking information about it.

1096
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,180
But Hey man, it's not a false reality like Q Anon.

1097
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:33,660
I was working with the president for real, you know, not in a fantasy world, not online,

1098
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,540
not not in a lie, but in the real world.

1099
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,540
So was Barnes on record.

1100
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:41,600
So I know we're not as cool as the game, but we're in the real world.

1101
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,400
We're not in the simulation.

1102
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,380
But those that are already in the simulation want you to only worship the simulation.

1103
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,380
It's very sick.

1104
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,500
It's very sad.

1105
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:56,000
And now I have this horrible news that governor's mansions, a bunch of them have been attacked.

1106
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,420
They're using this to go into martial law.

1107
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,180
They're not given up with only 10 days left of Trump, nine and a half days because they

1108
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,860
want to repudiate everything he did before he leaves.

1109
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:11,180
This story does not evolve over the course of the show and it is dropped on Monday.

1110
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,180
Yeah.

1111
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,180
That makes sense.

1112
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,940
Because Alex is just unsurprising.

1113
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:15,940
Yeah.

1114
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,020
So Alex is not jealous of Q, but I think a lot of people are saying that he's jealous

1115
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,020
of Q.

1116
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,020
People like me.

1117
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,020
Yeah.

1118
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,020
I would also say that.

1119
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,020
Yeah.

1120
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,020
Yeah.

1121
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,020
Yeah.

1122
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,020
And he, he wants, he has some things to say about people who think that.

1123
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,340
And by the way, there are all these idiots that send me messages and I see it online.

1124
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,620
Jones is jealous of Q. Q took over his audience.

1125
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,180
Q man hits the money.

1126
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,580
I was persecuted for supporting Trump and almost went bankrupt.

1127
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,460
I could have co-opted the Q thing.

1128
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,700
I tried to be nice to him and educate him.

1129
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,980
Don't believe people you don't know.

1130
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,420
Don't go to random places.

1131
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,500
They didn't listen.

1132
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,060
So he could have co-opted them if you wanted to.

1133
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,060
Of course.

1134
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,820
Here's him from a year ago talking to Joel Skousen.

1135
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:54,820
Let's hear it.

1136
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:58,580
I was thinking, I was thinking I'm just going to endorse it and then, and then co-opt it

1137
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:03,860
publicly and go, Oh, Q says this, Q says that, cause everybody loves a little magic stuff

1138
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,820
because it's, it's, it's, it's, it's definitely a delusional issue and it's sucking up so

1139
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,020
many good people into it.

1140
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,020
Yes.

1141
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,020
Yeah.

1142
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,300
So he was thinking about using Q like a puppet.

1143
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,300
Q says this, Q says that.

1144
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,300
And he did.

1145
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,300
He did try that.

1146
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,300
Yes, he did.

1147
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,300
And it did not work.

1148
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,300
No, it did not.

1149
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,740
Which led to him being more jealous of Q.

1150
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,500
And very frustrated.

1151
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,460
So Barnes gets down to the, the, like really the matter at hand.

1152
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,700
He cuts through the bullshit and this is really what it's about.

1153
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,660
Those people who are out there, you know, continue to crowdsource investigative independent

1154
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:40,900
research and review, continue to do independent grassroots journalism independent of and separate

1155
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:45,740
from and divorce from Q, continue to be proactive and productive, continue to support places

1156
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:46,740
like Infowars.

1157
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:52,380
Infowars is the model for independent information and a free press and free speech to stay alive.

1158
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,460
That's what it's really about.

1159
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:59,620
It's about transitioning people back from that, you know, making them feel safe and

1160
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:03,820
not judged for coming back to Infowars away from Q.

1161
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,060
Yeah.

1162
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,100
Because Q, I don't know if you know this, Chinese operation.

1163
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,100
Great.

1164
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,100
I'm glad to be here.

1165
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,100
Anybody's part of Q.

1166
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,980
You're part of a ChaiCom operation.

1167
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,540
Disown Q and return to Americanism.

1168
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,540
That's right.

1169
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:21,060
It's Manchurian Candidate 2.0.

1170
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,900
And folks, we have storeable food at the 2020 prices.

1171
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,900
Only a few days left.

1172
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:26,900
Good.

1173
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,900
Good stuff.

1174
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:35,480
So we got a real, just a scathing broadside attack on Q on this Sunday episode.

1175
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,760
And that's most of what it is.

1176
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,060
But I think that it's pretty important for Alex to lay this all out because he's got

1177
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:46,140
to disavow and get away from the stuff that happened at the Capitol.

1178
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,420
And people have got to take a fall for that, and the people that are going to fall are

1179
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,740
going to be Antifa, who are already villains.

1180
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:57,720
And QAnon is now not just some kind of a, hey, it's good, but oh, whatever.

1181
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,340
It's not the same.

1182
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,860
He's not just jealous of it anymore.

1183
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,040
They're bad now.

1184
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:11,780
And also apparently some hired militia who's unspecified.

1185
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,020
But yeah, so you can get away from that.

1186
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:19,660
And now when we get to the 11th, which is Monday, I really felt like it's Alex trying

1187
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,780
to turn to the direction that he's going to be going in.

1188
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:29,200
I felt an amazing return to like, this is so fucking familiar.

1189
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,140
This is like right before Obama got elected.

1190
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:37,420
He's just pretending that mere days ago people didn't storm the Capitol.

1191
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:42,660
Yeah, it turns out like, you know, you got nine days left till the election.

1192
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:46,620
And Antifa, they're going to rule you.

1193
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:54,620
Nine days from now, the globalist will be swearing in their installed puppet leader

1194
00:51:54,620 --> 00:52:02,460
in exactly nine days to the minute, basically.

1195
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:09,140
Things kick off at noon Eastern, but they say about 20 minutes in, he'll be sworn in.

1196
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:13,580
Joe Biden, the open communist operative.

1197
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:19,480
And that's why from L.A. to New York to Austin, Texas, Antifa marched to the streets with

1198
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:25,660
shields and guns and weapons, saying we own this country, it is ours.

1199
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:30,560
And next, they're coming to your houses because by day and by night, they're Antifa.

1200
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:36,040
But their real job is contact tracers for the Clinton Global Initiative on record.

1201
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:42,800
These are the graduate students and students who are now your rulers, most of them pedophiles.

1202
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,220
So now we just kind of have a more extreme version of how he was trying to scare you

1203
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:54,540
about like job, or not, what is it, AmeriCorps and like civic work programs that Obama wanted

1204
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,480
to put in place.

1205
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,100
It's just kind of the same thing.

1206
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:02,100
It just feels like you just, you're just going to pretend that didn't happen.

1207
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,100
Yeah.

1208
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:07,320
Hey, I'm not going to talk to a Republican about tax rates because I don't care because

1209
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,460
guess what is underneath that conversation?

1210
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,280
I want to kill the left, so I don't give a fuck.

1211
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,620
Don't you dare talk to me about some program.

1212
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:15,620
The end.

1213
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,020
The programs are done.

1214
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:24,880
It's hard to, it's hard to engage on any argument that it's hard to believe that it's really

1215
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,200
what's being discussed.

1216
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,200
Yeah.

1217
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,200
Yeah.

1218
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,200
Here's what's being discussed.

1219
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,200
You want to kill me.

1220
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,320
Now we need to deal with that and you have nothing, like I don't understand why any Republican

1221
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:39,240
is allowed on TV to say anything other than we're sorry for wanting to kill you all the

1222
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,600
time because I don't give a shit what they have to say on laws.

1223
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:47,920
I don't give a shit what they have to say on fucking taxes or voting or anything like

1224
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,920
that.

1225
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,920
You guys want to kill me.

1226
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,560
I think that the issue is that the ones who do want to kill you don't feel bad about it.

1227
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,560
Yeah.

1228
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,080
So they're not going to go on TV and say any of that stuff.

1229
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,080
Yeah.

1230
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,080
Well guess what?

1231
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,440
That's the only thing that other people get to talk about.

1232
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,040
All Republicans only get to talk about how they want to kill us.

1233
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,000
That's the only questions I have for them.

1234
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It's an interesting policy.

1235
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,920
I don't think the media is going to take you up on this.

1236
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,920
Yeah.

1237
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,360
I'm not surprised because they're also failing us in this regard as well.

1238
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:17,760
So speaking of media that's failing, Alex is failing himself and reality, but the reason

1239
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:24,580
that he's able to, I think, try to pull off moving back towards like just making you afraid

1240
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,580
of Joe Biden.

1241
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:26,580
Sure.

1242
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,900
Um, is that he's just decided that, uh, Hey, that whole thing at the Capitol was Antifa

1243
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,860
and Q and like we tried to stop it.

1244
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,700
We're the good guys.

1245
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,160
Those are terrorists.

1246
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,160
They don't hate the police.

1247
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,720
They don't want to be the police and they're the ones that went over a hundred of them

1248
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,720
on record.

1249
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,520
You know, their names dressed up like Trump supporters and Trump supporters tried to stop

1250
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,520
them breaking into the Capitol.

1251
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,560
Once they broke in, there was another contingent of morons there.

1252
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,520
We've tracked it to eight Jan and all the sites.

1253
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,800
So yeah, all of it is just that all the, uh, the good Patriots, they tried to stop them.

1254
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,800
It didn't work out.

1255
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:04,400
They were the ones who look like they were Trump supporters or just people in disguise.

1256
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,400
It's no big deal.

1257
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,400
We're still the heroes.

1258
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,720
We're the, uh, the oppressed where the aggrieved or even more aggrieved because they tried

1259
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,800
to make us look bad by storming the Capitol.

1260
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,800
Yeah.

1261
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,320
There's no moving forward until all of these people admit that they lied.

1262
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,320
That's it.

1263
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:23,280
You're like, honestly, I, how there's no change to Alex's programming unless he like, there's

1264
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,560
no change to those people listening to him unless Alex has to say he's a liar.

1265
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:32,640
Well Laura Ingram has to say she's a liar unless Lou Dobbs has to go on TV and say to

1266
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,440
the world, I lied to you because I want money.

1267
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,440
Yeah.

1268
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,720
But I don't think that even that would be that helpful.

1269
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,400
I mean, it would be nice because maybe it would ruin their careers.

1270
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,520
I mean, it's not going to, it's not going to solve anything, but nothing's going to

1271
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,000
change until that happens.

1272
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,360
But I also don't think anything will change after that.

1273
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,800
That has to, no, I mean, then we can start with other shit.

1274
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:57,840
Well, that's the first step though, but these media figures have to have some sort of accountability

1275
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,320
for their bullshit because they're the ones who inspired this.

1276
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,760
I agree that there should be some accountability and maybe they wouldn't be able to work anymore

1277
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,120
if they had to admit that they lied and that might be a positive.

1278
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,120
I would like that.

1279
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,320
However, they just get replaced by somebody else who's craven.

1280
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,320
And the audience would be...

1281
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:16,280
But at least they would know that eventually you have to admit you're lying.

1282
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,280
Well, yes.

1283
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,280
Eventually.

1284
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,320
Once people storm the Capitol, you will be forced to admit, you know.

1285
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,400
Sooner or later you have to admit you're a liar.

1286
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,640
At least you know that's in the, in your head because these people aren't going to.

1287
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,640
Enjoy your run.

1288
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,920
Enjoy, you know, it's going to be all great.

1289
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,920
Yeah.

1290
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,760
Gravy and tell people have an insurrection.

1291
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:33,760
It's just like Trump.

1292
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,760
Like, Hey, I get it.

1293
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,480
You were, you got what you got.

1294
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:42,400
I'm sorry, government and everybody failed and allowed you here, but this can't happen.

1295
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,400
This can't happen.

1296
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,600
Well, I, I, I'm of the opinion that even if those media figures were to come out and be

1297
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:53,520
like, I lied because I was trying to make money or whatever, it wouldn't matter that

1298
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,320
much because the audience wouldn't be disillusioned.

1299
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,240
They'd just be like, well, I got to find someone new.

1300
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,200
This person sold out or something.

1301
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,600
And Alex has the same complaint about the Q people and you're still saying Trump will

1302
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,360
be in office in nine days.

1303
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,760
Well, let's sit back and watch.

1304
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,720
And I know you Q folks aren't going to go away even once that happens because you bought

1305
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,560
into a lie, just like you sent the Nigerian email scam or that first thousand bucks and

1306
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,040
your family says, that's a scam.

1307
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,040
They need 5,000 more.

1308
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,280
You'll never get that either.

1309
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,320
No, I'll get a million now.

1310
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:30,840
And I send Prince of booboo, the 5,000.

1311
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,360
And after you've said everything you've got to the scammers, you'll hate your family for

1312
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,360
warning you.

1313
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,360
It doesn't matter.

1314
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,080
We're going to move on from that.

1315
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,640
I think Alex got tricked by those emails.

1316
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,640
Wow.

1317
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,900
Yeah, he is right.

1318
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,120
They will hate your family for warning you.

1319
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,840
I am aware of that type of situation.

1320
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:56,200
So I always enjoy it when Alex gets in reporter mode and he reports things that were brought

1321
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:02,960
to his attention by his wife's tennis partner, hard hitting scoops.

1322
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:08,520
In this next clip, we get some second or third hand information from somebody who works in

1323
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:13,520
security for Alex, who heard something from his mother.

1324
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,800
And now Alex is reporting it on air as news.

1325
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:22,900
I talked to one of our security guys that, you know, bonded security, armed security.

1326
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:29,200
We have her at the office and his mom is one of the head nurses at a nursing home.

1327
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:35,960
And she said, wow, they gave all the old people the shots and now a bunch are sick and none

1328
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,560
of them are getting up and coming to eat.

1329
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,800
They just got the shots last week and they're real lethargic and they're worried they're

1330
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,800
going to start dying.

1331
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:48,960
So I'll tell you next week, I'll tell you next week, how many, how many you're dead.

1332
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,160
How about you not talk about this until next week then, because the number could be zero.

1333
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,160
Yeah.

1334
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,160
You dick.

1335
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,160
Yeah.

1336
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,160
Oh no.

1337
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,120
But then you won't spend the next week in fear of the number not being zero.

1338
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,120
Oh yeah.

1339
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,760
But it's so important because my security guy talked to his mom and I heard this third

1340
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,680
hand that I've got to try and make you scared of something that may or may not happen.

1341
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,680
Sounds right.

1342
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:09,840
Sounds right.

1343
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:13,240
I think Alex is probably only reporting this because of his media diet.

1344
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:18,800
And he read something in the Ron Paul Institute website that is important.

1345
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,440
A nursing home at zero coronavirus deaths is then at vaccine residents for coronavirus

1346
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,080
and deaths began.

1347
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,400
Ron Paul Institute.

1348
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:31,040
So this article is about a nursing home from around New York called the Commons on St.

1349
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,040
Anthony.

1350
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:36,680
The most recent report from CNY central has the number of deaths there at 32 since December

1351
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:41,240
21st, which is when an outbreak of COVID-19 began.

1352
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,200
The outbreak predates the first vaccinations.

1353
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:48,080
Many residents and staff received the first dose of the vaccine on December 22nd, and

1354
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,680
the second doses weren't begun until January 12th.

1355
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,440
It's an interesting case here where the actual line that Alex says might not actually be

1356
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,520
factually inaccurate, but it's still a lie.

1357
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:03,240
It may well be the case that the deaths began after the vaccination started, but the headline

1358
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:07,320
is being used by people like Alex and like Ron Paul to suggest that there's a causal

1359
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,040
relationship there.

1360
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:13,240
This story is not interesting to Alex, except as a means to convince his audience that vaccines

1361
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,240
are a deadly plan from the globalists.

1362
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,640
So he wouldn't be covering the story unless the message you were supposed to take from

1363
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,820
it is that vaccines killed the people in the Commons.

1364
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:24,680
And that's just not earned.

1365
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,840
That information is not there to be reported.

1366
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,840
Yep.

1367
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,840
Yep.

1368
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:34,240
You can listen to your security guy's mom, or maybe the security guy making stuff up

1369
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,240
about what his mom said.

1370
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,240
Who knows?

1371
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,280
Yeah, I despair for the possibility of anyone learning anymore.

1372
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,280
Nope.

1373
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,280
It's just not gonna happen.

1374
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,280
Nope.

1375
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,280
Nope.

1376
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,800
And I'd like to convince you even more of that.

1377
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:50,600
I can't wait, because I have got nothing but bad news on that front, Dan.

1378
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,280
Because it's over for humanity.

1379
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,280
Yes, thank you.

1380
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,280
There will only be lone survivors.

1381
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,680
I knew he was back!

1382
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,080
I said it earlier, fuck yeah.

1383
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,080
You did call it.

1384
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,080
Now then, it's over for that-

1385
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,080
Mike Adams.

1386
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,400
Oh, fuck all of these people.

1387
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,720
Fuck all of these people!

1388
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:10,800
Well, Mike Adams, the health ranger, noted rapper, weirdo, Ebola curer.

1389
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,800
Sure.

1390
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,180
Yes, he did cure Ebola.

1391
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,180
That's true.

1392
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:21,000
He was sort of exiled from Info Wars, because he had an approach to the pandemic after a

1393
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
while.

1394
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Right.

1395
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
People should take this seriously.

1396
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
That should be-

1397
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
This is not good.

1398
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
That should be boiled down to, a lot of people are gonna die if people-

1399
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,920
People keep saying the shit that I used to say.

1400
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:36,680
He joined up with Alex for quite a while in doing COVID denialism and COVID paranoia,

1401
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:43,320
alternatingly, and then they had a little bit of a disagreement, and he was not seen

1402
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,320
for quite a while.

1403
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,320
Quite a while.

1404
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,760
He is back, because now it's time to just complain about Biden, and the two of them

1405
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,320
can do that just fine.

1406
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,320
All day.

1407
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,440
Joining us is Mike Adams at NaturalNews.com.

1408
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,520
Appreciate him coming on with us.

1409
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:00,240
He's written an excellent article, 25 Insane Crazy Agendas, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris

1410
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,800
will push on America if they seize power after rigging the election.

1411
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,040
Mike, thanks for joining us.

1412
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,500
What is your big takeaway about the state of the nation and where we are and what's

1413
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,920
unfolding before we come back next segment and get into your report?

1414
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,200
I would expect, if this is happening, that the two of them should really get into and

1415
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:22,880
discuss what their differences were and why he hasn't been on for so long.

1416
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,320
Right, I guess we'll just pretend that didn't happen.

1417
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,320
Let's pretend that-

1418
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,320
Nope.

1419
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,320
He didn't learn.

1420
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,320
Well, who's right?

1421
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,720
Because he had factually different-

1422
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,780
Nah, nah, it's fine.

1423
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:34,780
It wasn't opinions.

1424
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,580
No, it was opinions, because they were both making everything up.

1425
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:38,580
That could be.

1426
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,580
Yeah.

1427
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:42,400
So, Mike is thinking that maybe Trump, right?

1428
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,400
Sure.

1429
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:48,100
So, maybe he doesn't want to be president, again, not of America.

1430
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,040
Maybe he wants to start a new country.

1431
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,040
I'm removing Trump.

1432
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:56,480
He has a very, very narrow window of opportunity to stop this now, but Alex, for all we know,

1433
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,440
Trump may have thrown in the towel at this point and said, you know what?

1434
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,600
The swamp is too deep to drain.

1435
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,600
You can't fix the system from the inside.

1436
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,600
That is probably true.

1437
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,600
I'll give you that.

1438
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,600
Perhaps Trump is deciding that the only way to really fix America is to let the corrupt

1439
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:15,920
system implode and fail and crater and then start a new system on the other side.

1440
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,200
That may be what he's thinking.

1441
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,200
We don't know.

1442
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,120
He may be thinking, let's start a new confederacy.

1443
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,160
Yeah, that does kind of sound like what he would be thinking right now.

1444
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,920
And what you guys are desperately hoping he's thinking.

1445
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:27,920
Yeah.

1446
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,920
Yeah.

1447
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:34,480
I'm kind of, I'm getting to the point where I'm like, yeah, you guys should go somewhere

1448
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,720
else.

1449
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,720
All of you.

1450
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,680
I don't think, I understand that thought, but I just don't think it's functional.

1451
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:45,920
There's uninhabitable places in Australia that could use a lot of Republicans, Dan.

1452
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,800
You meant uninhabited, but you said uninhabitable.

1453
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:53,160
No, I did mean uninhabitable and that's where Republicans should go and maybe they can terraform

1454
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,160
it.

1455
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,160
We could send them to Mars and then we could move.

1456
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,160
We've got options, Dan.

1457
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,920
I understand there's some of that elusive free market over there.

1458
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:05,080
There's a lot of manpower that we're wasting that could be on Mars leaving us alone.

1459
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:11,840
So Mike is on, but he has a little bit of a time window and that's because Trump is

1460
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:15,960
supposed to give a speech in the middle of when this episode is on.

1461
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:16,960
Right.

1462
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,760
And it's happening because it gets pushed back and then there's a speech for the next

1463
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:27,760
day at Alamo, but it's not the Alamo, it's Alamo, Texas, which is all very confusing

1464
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,900
and it plays out over the course of this episode.

1465
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,280
That did not happen.

1466
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:36,840
We did not have a city version of the fucking Four Seasons.

1467
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:42,600
It's not for sure because Alamo, Texas is also like a border town and so there's a possibility

1468
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:47,760
that that still feeds into the messaging that Trump would want to send with the border.

1469
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:53,320
It should absolutely, his time in public should begin and end with being racist towards our

1470
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,320
southern border.

1471
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,320
You would think.

1472
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,320
That's great.

1473
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:00,680
But also, you would expect that he would want to give a speech at the Alamo.

1474
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,680
Yes, you would.

1475
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:06,160
Just like he would want to give a speech at the Four Seasons hotel.

1476
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,720
Right, right.

1477
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,280
It does seem like a pattern.

1478
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:14,160
Anyway, this speech, Mike doesn't think it's going to be anything big.

1479
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,720
Trump set to speak in about 30 minutes.

1480
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:18,560
What do you think he's going to say?

1481
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:22,280
Well, I have no idea what he's going to say because all the options are on the table.

1482
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:30,560
I suspect it's going to be kind of wishy-washy because he's still got a week or more in office

1483
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,600
and he's still got options on the table and there are a lot of things that can happen.

1484
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,880
So I suspect he's not going to concede, but he's also not going to commit.

1485
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,080
I'm sad to say, but we'll have to wait and see.

1486
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:45,040
He doesn't need to concede and he's already accepted that he's lost.

1487
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,440
So I don't...

1488
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:54,000
I don't care what he does at all as long as he's quiet.

1489
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,360
So you know who Mike doesn't want to be quieted?

1490
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,920
That's Pompeo.

1491
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,200
No, he should absolutely be quieted.

1492
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:08,160
It turns out that he wants Mike Pompeo to seize a bunch of URLs.

1493
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,880
What if he instead got sent to Mars?

1494
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:16,360
Well, I guess that would be fine as long as from Mars he has a Wi-Fi connection and he

1495
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,000
can seize Amazon's...

1496
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I don't know if I want that.

1497
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,180
What I do want to mention, Alex, is that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has a move that he could

1498
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:30,600
make right now to fight back against this big tech deplatforming of Parler and other

1499
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,560
conservative platforms and individuals.

1500
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:39,360
Mike Pompeo could order the State Department to seize the domain names of Amazon.com, Google.com,

1501
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,000
Facebook.com, YouTube, Twitter, and so on.

1502
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:49,760
Seize the domain names and charge those companies with acting as part of a foreign cyber warfare

1503
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,480
attack on the United States of America to rig our elections.

1504
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,480
That'd go well, I think.

1505
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,960
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

1506
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,880
I think people would respond positively towards that.

1507
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,400
I think it would give everybody peace of mind.

1508
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:08,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the government is taking over some of the largest websites as a hostile

1509
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,720
action.

1510
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:10,720
Yeah, I think that's good.

1511
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:16,760
10 days, 9 days before a president who lost an election is supposed to go out of office,

1512
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,320
his State Department is attacking.

1513
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:21,320
Yeah, that'd be good, that'd be awesome.

1514
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,600
I'm liking everything Pompeo's doing right now.

1515
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,600
It's really great.

1516
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:29,000
I love the way he's trying to convince people that it'd be a good idea for him to be president

1517
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
someday.

1518
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,320
Yeah, good work.

1519
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:36,240
So Mike Adams, the health ranger, might not have gotten the memo that Alex hates QAnon

1520
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,240
now.

1521
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,240
Sure, sure.

1522
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,320
Because he's coming in with some Q shit.

1523
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,600
He's got material that he could declassify.

1524
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,080
We know they have.

1525
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:50,320
Sidney Powell routinely spoke about the information, the Kraken details from the 305th Military

1526
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,320
Intelligence Battalion.

1527
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,720
That wasn't just fiction.

1528
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,320
So Sidney Powell submitted information in an affidavit that was supposed to be provided

1529
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:02,600
by an anonymous source that she had codenamed Spider with a Y.

1530
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:06,640
Unfortunately she did a bad job of redacting her documents, so she accidentally doxxed

1531
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,480
her source, who's an IT consultant named Joshua Merritt.

1532
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:15,120
He claimed to be in the military intelligence, working in the 305th Battalion, but that's

1533
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,560
all bullshit.

1534
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,400
Merritt was never an intelligence analyst and didn't even make it through the appropriate

1535
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,360
training courses in the army.

1536
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:26,220
When confronted about this statement and the fact that it's clearly not true, he basically

1537
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:29,800
said that he hadn't really read the statement he signed before signing it, which raises

1538
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,440
a whole lot of questions about who in Powell's team wrote it.

1539
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:41,240
Doesn't that mean that you, isn't that, can't you be like, barred or something held in contempt?

1540
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,080
Put Sidney Powell in jail!

1541
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:47,960
So part of the recent QAnon lore is that this 305th Battalion, nicknamed the Kraken, had

1542
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:52,420
raided the server host in Germany and they'd seized a bunch of evidence of election fraud

1543
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:55,040
and proof that like the CIA was involved and shit.

1544
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:59,520
This naturally all traces back to a Facebook post by some random QAnon follower making

1545
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,320
shit up.

1546
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:05,960
That's the story that Powell's affidavit was looking to reinforce, by way of assigning

1547
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,840
the story to a meant-to-be-anonymous person in military intelligence.

1548
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:14,000
The story is shit when you know that it's just coming from a QAnon Facebook account,

1549
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,840
but if you can pretend that there's some real deep insider named Spider, you can make more

1550
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,000
people like Mike Adams buy it.

1551
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,560
Anyway, the point here is that people like Alex and Mike want whatever benefit they can

1552
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,720
derive from believing the same stuff that Q followers do, and they want to use the same

1553
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:32,240
sources of information that QAnon people do, but they want to pretend that they're somehow

1554
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,120
above it, and it is pathetic.

1555
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:42,160
Yeah, the only, like when people are tweeting like, I can't believe Alex turned on Q.

1556
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:47,440
Believe it, but also what we should be doing is sowing as much division between the two

1557
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:53,440
as possible while recognizing that both of them are complete liars and full of shit.

1558
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:57,840
I want Q people and info-warriors to fight on the streets.

1559
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,400
And they will on their own.

1560
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,400
Yeah, exactly.

1561
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,840
You don't have to do anything for them to end up at loggerheads.

1562
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,400
I know, but it'd be fun to fan the flames a little bit.

1563
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:13,520
It's interesting because it really felt like there was an opportunity after the 6th where

1564
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:20,320
they could get past whatever differences they had, but instead it seems like there's now

1565
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:24,000
an irrevocable difference.

1566
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,500
You would think that until next week when they all decide that there is no difference

1567
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,880
between them and it's all fine.

1568
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:34,240
I think that some groups could end up finding common ground, but I don't think Alex and

1569
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,280
Q are going down that road.

1570
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,840
We'll see.

1571
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:44,800
So Mike, he's learned that some hackers, some liberal hackers, have gotten all the data

1572
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,880
from everybody who's ever done anything with Parler.

1573
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,000
I imagine he would be worried about that.

1574
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,480
Yeah, I bet.

1575
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:56,080
There's credible information coming out today that then left-wing Black Hat cyber-hackers

1576
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:01,840
have been able to hack through the authentication system that ran Parler and that they are right

1577
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:09,400
now downloading enormous amounts of data from Parler users, perhaps including the driver's

1578
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,840
licenses and metadata geolocation data that people had uploaded.

1579
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,600
That's a breaking story right now.

1580
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,880
I've been getting that from multiple sources.

1581
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,640
It's my understanding reading up on this that this is not accurate at all.

1582
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,500
This is an exaggeration of what happened.

1583
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:30,200
And it's just what people had posted on Parler, people were able to archive.

1584
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:36,420
Not that you had access to all the people's driver's licenses and shit, but I did try

1585
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:40,760
to sign up for a Parler account because I wanted to follow people like Alex and it had

1586
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,760
those kind of requirements.

1587
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,760
I'm like, fuck no.

1588
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:43,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1589
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,760
Absolutely not.

1590
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,760
Good God, no.

1591
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,680
Why, why would you, if you're a Nazi, why would you give somebody your driver's license?

1592
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,680
Right.

1593
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,680
That's insane.

1594
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:53,680
Yeah.

1595
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,480
And it's like the same people who are all up in arms about like gun registration.

1596
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,480
Insane.

1597
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,480
Insane.

1598
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:02,440
Yeah, I also had a picture of my driver's license to get a place where I can tweet violently.

1599
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,440
Just insane.

1600
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,440
Yeah.

1601
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:09,180
And so like I understand why there would be fear and concern about that, but my understanding

1602
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:14,520
at the point of when we were recording this episode is that that is a deep embellishment.

1603
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:18,400
And I think that the reason that that embellishment works really well for someone like Mike is

1604
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,100
that it allows them to talk about this kind of stuff.

1605
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,720
They are going to go door to door.

1606
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:26,600
There are going to be death squads under a Biden-Harris administration.

1607
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,600
Cool.

1608
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,840
And they're going to try to literally carry out a genocide against conservatives across

1609
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,840
America.

1610
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:37,320
So because they took all the information from Parler, they got all the addresses of everybody,

1611
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:41,960
now Biden's going to take Antifa and they're going to go door to door death squatting.

1612
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,960
Okay.

1613
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,680
Dan, I have a question for you.

1614
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:45,680
Yeah.

1615
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:46,680
All right.

1616
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:47,680
It's bad.

1617
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,680
What happened on the 6th?

1618
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,680
Right?

1619
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,680
Yes.

1620
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:55,080
According to Alex and this, because it's Antifa provocateurs.

1621
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,200
Well, everything until that point was good though.

1622
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,200
Right.

1623
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,200
Right.

1624
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,200
Right.

1625
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,200
Right.

1626
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,200
Now, if you don't want that to happen.

1627
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,200
Yeah.

1628
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,200
Right.

1629
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:08,360
I would say you would not use inflammatory language towards your political opponents.

1630
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,360
Right.

1631
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:13,560
But if you did want that to happen again, you might, you would say that your political

1632
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:20,200
opponents were planning on murdering you and that, uh, you know, I'm not saying that he's,

1633
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,200
he's immediate.

1634
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,200
I didn't say that.

1635
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,520
He just said, Hey, we should go storm the Capitol building again.

1636
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:29,840
But if I was somebody who believed things like say that Biden and Kamala Harris will

1637
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:34,680
be sending death squads to my house door to door, I might think maybe what I need to do

1638
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:38,960
is get a bunch of friends together and go storm the fucking Capitol building.

1639
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:39,960
Yeah.

1640
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:45,480
You've arrived at the thesis of my, uh, uh, neighbors.

1641
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:50,160
It's only five, but neighbors, I'm just a little tense, Dan.

1642
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,160
Right.

1643
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,160
I understand.

1644
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,480
And it's, it's weird because like you could hear a lot of the stuff that they're talking

1645
01:13:55,480 --> 01:14:02,040
about and be like, do you not recognize what, like what world we're living in now?

1646
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,880
Cause like, listen to this, this could have been on his show in like 2010.

1647
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,240
Yeah, absolutely.

1648
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,200
And I've even, I've got a contact, a very reputable, a former military contact on the

1649
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:18,840
ground, uh, in Maryland today texted me and said that they are setting up the FEMA operation

1650
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:23,520
there in, in Maryland, a specific County, I don't want to name setting up tents and

1651
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:24,520
emergency equipment.

1652
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:29,800
I've had army special operations current call and confirm they are preparing for gun confiscation.

1653
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,560
They're preparing FEMA camps right now.

1654
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,560
Yep.

1655
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,560
Yep.

1656
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,560
They are setting it all up.

1657
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,680
This is all in place.

1658
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,680
We're back.

1659
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,680
We're back to this.

1660
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,680
What's happening again?

1661
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:43,360
They, we've talked a bunch over the years about taking them off the air and whether

1662
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,280
or not yada, yada, yada, this needs to be taken off the air immediately.

1663
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:47,280
Yeah.

1664
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,280
It's outrageous.

1665
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,280
Immediately.

1666
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,680
It's, it's, uh, it's outrageous because it is the exact kind of behavior that would incite

1667
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:58,120
people towards the sort of behavior that we saw last week off the air now immediately.

1668
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,760
And it's so intentional, like, yeah, absolutely.

1669
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,160
It's absolutely intentional.

1670
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:07,180
You are very clearly setting the stage for another of the same thing that you're pretending

1671
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:09,000
you didn't fucking want in the first place.

1672
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Yeah.

1673
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And it needs to be off the air immediately.

1674
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,720
Well, I mean, let's go, let's go back to the terrorist edging analogy.

1675
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:15,720
Totally.

1676
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:19,040
You know, it's not, it's, it doesn't work if you let everything go back to normal.

1677
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:23,840
You've got to turn the temperature back up pretty quickly.

1678
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,880
And that's what we're seeing here.

1679
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,440
We're seeing the exact same things that Alex always does.

1680
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:35,080
Uh, just as if, as if that event didn't happen because to Alex, it didn't, it was

1681
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:40,480
Antifa, it was all fake, it wasn't the natural, it wasn't the natural result of this kind

1682
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,920
of rhetoric where they're going to put us in camps and go door to door and kill our

1683
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:44,920
families.

1684
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:45,920
I'm a good person.

1685
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:50,640
I absolutely am not at least partially responsible for the deaths of multiple people.

1686
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:56,040
That's definitely not Alex Jones's fault because Q and Antifa working together at the behest

1687
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,040
of the deep state.

1688
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:03,440
Uh, yeah, he's, he's absolutely directly, uh, partially responsible for the deaths of

1689
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,440
all of those people.

1690
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,440
No, no, no.

1691
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,120
Listen, they're very, they're very clear about this.

1692
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,120
They don't want any violence.

1693
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,120
Should be arrested.

1694
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,120
They don't want any violence.

1695
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:11,920
One hundred percent should be arrested and charged with conspiracy.

1696
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:12,920
They don't want any violence.

1697
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:18,300
I just want to reiterate to everybody here, you know, never initiate violence.

1698
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:20,300
We always have the right to self-defense.

1699
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:25,680
If commanders engage in violence against the American people, they're a general, a general

1700
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,080
is more in command than the private that pulls the trigger.

1701
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,080
They must be held accountable.

1702
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:32,840
Well, I hope that Trump will announce shortly, although I doubt it, but I hope that Trump

1703
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,140
would say we are in a state of war.

1704
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:40,920
We are now enemy occupied territory and that Trump would invoke every, every American citizen

1705
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,040
to defend the Republic.

1706
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,040
I hope that's what he says, but I don't think he will.

1707
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,040
I mean, let's be clear.

1708
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:51,160
I'm saying if they start arresting and gun confiscating and killing Patriots, the generals

1709
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,840
that are running this are, are, they started the war.

1710
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,440
I'm all about defensive defense.

1711
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:59,840
I'm not about offense, but Americans need to know that, uh, you know, these guys are

1712
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:03,360
already violent, the Nuremberg cove, the Geneva convention, but the forced inoculations are

1713
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,360
trying to push.

1714
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:07,680
They've already put us under COVID martial law and it's clear they're going to make their

1715
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,680
move.

1716
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:12,640
Mike, I'm not about, I'm not about offense, but all defenses actually are all offenses

1717
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,080
really actually defense.

1718
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,080
Yeah.

1719
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,200
No violence offensively, but all violence will be justified.

1720
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,200
No.

1721
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:25,640
Um, I am challenging the health ranger to a fight whomever wins gets to storm the Capitol

1722
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,640
building.

1723
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,280
No, I will not sponsor this fight.

1724
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:35,000
I can't believe that this is, I know I was listening to this episode and I'm like, is

1725
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:44,040
this like from a two years ago, do they recognize, like it doesn't feel like they're living in

1726
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:48,920
a world where people just stormed the fucking Capitol building.

1727
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,240
Nope, Nope, Nope.

1728
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:55,280
I mean, you either have to completely lie to yourself or you're a complete psychopath.

1729
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,280
I think it's the latter.

1730
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:57,320
Yeah, it has to be.

1731
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:03,280
And it's just like, that's just shit that you can't, we can't have this.

1732
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,280
They're doing it again.

1733
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,280
Yeah.

1734
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,280
It's outrageous.

1735
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,400
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

1736
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,400
Yeah, I know.

1737
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,400
Yeah.

1738
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,400
Mike down for this.

1739
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,400
Cause you're going to feel like you're losing.

1740
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,400
Mike down for the rest of the show.

1741
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,400
Yes.

1742
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,400
You're out.

1743
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,360
Uh, you're going to feel like you're losing your mind a bunch more.

1744
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:20,920
Yeah, it is really happening and the way you can survive it because perhaps about 10% of

1745
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:26,400
the human population will make it through is you have to be entirely self-reliant off

1746
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,160
the grid as much as possible.

1747
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:34,440
You need to be able to grow your own food and to defend yourself and then, uh, survive

1748
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:39,200
the onslaught of the mass illegal immigration that's coming, the troops, the Chinese troops

1749
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:43,760
that are going to invade at some point, the, the, the government, uh, you know, jackbooted

1750
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,280
thugs that Biden's going to unleash against them.

1751
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,280
They won't invade.

1752
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,600
They're already calling them helpers that they're visiting helpers.

1753
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,600
That's right.

1754
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,600
That's right.

1755
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,040
And, and by the way, they're going to, they're going to attack the churches, uh, just like

1756
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,040
communist China.

1757
01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:00,160
They're going to try to burn down the churches and arrest the pastors who don't go along

1758
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,440
with the globalist agenda.

1759
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:08,040
So, uh, if your pastor is truly teaching the word of Christ, he or she will be under attack.

1760
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:12,160
If they're, if they're telling you to surrender, then they, they will be allowed to exist.

1761
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:17,400
So underground churches, underground farming, everybody needs to understand now we're losing

1762
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,920
the country, we're going under longterm globalist occupation.

1763
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,760
The Republicans didn't know what hit them.

1764
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,840
Gorilla food farming is going to be a very big thing.

1765
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,840
Smuggling seeds.

1766
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:32,760
It'll be just like growing marijuana, growing tomatoes, growing pumpkins, growing squash,

1767
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:33,760
growing.

1768
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,740
Everything's going to be under the radar now, including money, by the way, because the dollar

1769
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:39,160
will collapse.

1770
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,920
Money will move to alternative systems, including crypto systems.

1771
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,980
I'm sorry to tell you this, but this is the world government takeover.

1772
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,320
We warned you about it's now here.

1773
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,200
They're coming to kill you and your family.

1774
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,200
Sorry, folks.

1775
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,200
I didn't make it up.

1776
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,200
I mean, they mean business.

1777
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,200
Bill Gates wants to kill you.

1778
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,200
We'll be right back.

1779
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,400
Stay with us.

1780
01:19:54,400 --> 01:20:00,400
I don't know how you could behave in this way after, after an event like what we saw.

1781
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:05,840
I just don't, I don't know how you can allow yourself to behave this way.

1782
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:14,520
I am just reminding myself of something that the great thinker, uh, uh, Robert Barnes once

1783
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:20,600
said, which is that, uh, they made these people feel like that election was the end of the

1784
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,600
world.

1785
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,600
Oh yeah.

1786
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:23,600
The most important thing that ever happened.

1787
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,040
And that's how they convinced them.

1788
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:28,480
I remember when Q was talking about smuggling seeds.

1789
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:34,640
I remember all of those things being very important just a short period of time ago.

1790
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:35,640
Yeah.

1791
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:36,640
It's almost jarring.

1792
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:37,640
Yeah.

1793
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:43,560
I don't, I mean, I, I just genuinely don't know how to like, I, I'm, I'm shaking, I'm

1794
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,560
just shaking.

1795
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:50,000
Like I'm in constant, you've motioned something needs to happen and I can't, I can't do anything

1796
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
right now.

1797
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,600
I'm listening to him speak and I'm like, how much is a flight to punch Robert Barnes in

1798
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,600
the face?

1799
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,080
Shouldn't you want to punch Mike Adams?

1800
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,080
Sure.

1801
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,080
Okay.

1802
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,840
I put it, get them all in the same, put them in a line, put them in a line, I'll walk down

1803
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:04,840
it.

1804
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:11,000
Look, I know that you're frustrated with Mike, but I just, he just told me that only 10%

1805
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,840
week, Oh, he's right, they should go underground.

1806
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:14,840
All right.

1807
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,400
We'll dig a giant hole beneath Texas.

1808
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:23,800
We'll put them all in there and then just close it up and then they'll, the mole people

1809
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,240
will eventually come to the surface and take us over.

1810
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:28,240
That's too similar to FEMA camps just underground.

1811
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,240
No, they'll take us over.

1812
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,240
I understand.

1813
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,720
The Morlocks will rise once more.

1814
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,720
Look, you might be mad at Mike, but this is the last time maybe that he'll ever be able

1815
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:36,720
to come on Info Wars.

1816
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,720
Good.

1817
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:38,720
Mike Adams, you're dead on.

1818
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:41,700
We are not exaggerating one Centella.

1819
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,960
It's frankly worse than you even said worse than I can describe.

1820
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,360
And I just won't lie to the public.

1821
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,960
This is the Megaton attack.

1822
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:48,960
This is the biggest salt.

1823
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:49,960
People better get ready.

1824
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:50,960
Yeah, absolutely.

1825
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:55,200
And if I could just say on a personal note, because for all we know, this may be the last

1826
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,460
time I can ever even appear on your show, who knows?

1827
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:03,080
But on a personal note, Alex, I'm one of the very few people in the world who, who I think

1828
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:08,420
can have just an inkling of an understanding of the personal sacrifice that you have made

1829
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:13,360
in order to continue to express your voice and, and to fight for humanity.

1830
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,520
And Trump has made the, you know, the greatest sacrifice.

1831
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,520
Deep breaths, Jerry.

1832
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,560
I've made, you know, I've been vilified and I've, I've had a sacrifice, but not to the

1833
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,560
extent that you have.

1834
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:27,760
And I just want to thank you for holding the line and speaking for humanity.

1835
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:28,760
Yeah.

1836
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:33,960
He wants to thank Alex for speaking for, on behalf of humanity, at least my section of

1837
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:37,360
it, which is my person, I'd say that Alex doesn't speak for me.

1838
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,320
Yeah, this is, this is a mess.

1839
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:44,640
Also, like you can't, you can't say stuff like we're not embellishing at all when you're

1840
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:49,780
talking about death squads coming door to door to have a genocide on conservatives if

1841
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:51,420
Biden gets into office.

1842
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:53,340
You're playing with fire.

1843
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,000
This is, this is not acceptable.

1844
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,280
No, they're trying to do it, but bigger this time.

1845
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,280
Yes.

1846
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,900
They're trying to do the sixth, but bigger this time and the fact that we're allowing

1847
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:05,780
this to happen as though that this is fine is insane because it's getting people killed.

1848
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:11,380
And Jordan, they're laying down the preemptive justification by saying that like, oh, the

1849
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:16,600
Q and Antifa, they're planning to do, that's why Alex is going to go to the inauguration

1850
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,600
on the 20th.

1851
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,600
Nope.

1852
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,760
Like they're planning to do more and do the same thing.

1853
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,760
It's just...

1854
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,160
No, they're killing people.

1855
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:27,680
As they speak words, people are dying due to them.

1856
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:28,680
Well, look...

1857
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:29,680
We have to deal with that.

1858
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:36,320
The reality is that, you know, Trump might get a second term, maybe, tiny bit.

1859
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,560
And if he does, maybe they'll get some of the things they wanted.

1860
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:44,580
If we survive this, then we are the real media for America.

1861
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:48,880
Because if Trump, if Trump gets a second term, if he pulls this out somehow that we don't

1862
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,800
yet know, he, he would take down probably the...

1863
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,120
Well, that's the thing.

1864
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,120
He's been surrounded.

1865
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,540
They've ignored him.

1866
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:57,540
His spirit was good.

1867
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:58,540
He did so much good.

1868
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:00,520
And everybody got mad at him that he wasn't perfect.

1869
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:03,440
Well, they're about to find out with Biden what Trump was holding back.

1870
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,440
Well, yeah.

1871
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:08,440
And also, I mean, I've got very good, incredible intelligence that Trump has been threatened

1872
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:12,680
with detonations of dirty bombs and nukes and all kinds of things.

1873
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:17,080
And you know, Trump doesn't want to see America turned into a radioactive wasteland.

1874
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:20,060
Oh, he looks so strong at Wednesday's speech.

1875
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:21,060
So defiant.

1876
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,060
I was there like 20 feet from him.

1877
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:23,060
They don't like me.

1878
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:24,060
I'm so strong.

1879
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:25,060
And I was like, my God, this is...

1880
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,600
He looked like a superhero up there.

1881
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:27,600
I'm serious.

1882
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,640
Superhero who whines a lot about evil.

1883
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:31,640
This is great.

1884
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:35,840
Mike's like, yeah, if Trump somehow magically manages to get a second term, he'll finally

1885
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,040
do the things we want him to do.

1886
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:41,600
And then Alex is like, yeah, you know, the only reason he's disappointed, disappointing

1887
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,920
is because he had, he was under threat.

1888
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,800
Mike's like, yeah, they were going to nuke cities.

1889
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,520
Get the fuck out of here.

1890
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,520
Grow up.

1891
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:54,240
Man, if Trump holds public office again, I'm storming the Capitol building by myself.

1892
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,240
That's what I'm doing.

1893
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,080
I don't want anybody else there.

1894
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,500
It's just me against the government.

1895
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,160
Just banging your head against the wall.

1896
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:02,160
That's all I'm doing.

1897
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,280
I don't care.

1898
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:07,520
So Trump needs to give an emergency broadcast, according to Alex.

1899
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,520
Sure.

1900
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,120
And then we get into some secession talk.

1901
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,360
I think that they want to succeed.

1902
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,360
Great.

1903
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,360
Good.

1904
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,360
Good.

1905
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:17,200
There's an oval office, not a farewell address, but an emergency address saying Biden's a

1906
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:18,200
Chinese agent.

1907
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,200
Here's the evidence.

1908
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,200
He's going to cut our power off.

1909
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,000
This is a foreign takeover.

1910
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,640
You've got, the governors must mobilize.

1911
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:27,120
You must have a constitutional convention, whatever you got to have.

1912
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,000
We just have to America's under attack.

1913
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,140
He must raise the alarm.

1914
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:33,280
He must just tell it like it is exactly right.

1915
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:38,480
And if for whatever reason he is unable to do that, then the American people need to

1916
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:43,960
make it known to Biden and Harris and Pelosi and others that we, the people do not consent

1917
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:49,240
to your tyranny, to your rigged elections, to your, your fraud, your false flag operations.

1918
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,240
We do not consent.

1919
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:55,840
In fact, we withdraw our consent from you and we, the people will declare a new independence.

1920
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:01,000
I believe all across this country, we will set up a new government, maybe starting by

1921
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,480
storming the Capitol building.

1922
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,480
Yeah.

1923
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:04,480
I'm going to have to go with this.

1924
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,480
This is fucked.

1925
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:08,280
I know it's, it's, this is fucked.

1926
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,280
Yeah.

1927
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:15,200
I mean, like we, the thing that's really difficult about this is that like, we've heard talk

1928
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:19,560
like this on info Wars a bunch over the years, but never.

1929
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:23,800
In the aftermath of something like what happened last week.

1930
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,800
Yeah.

1931
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:31,880
Like that should be a wake up call for people, particularly people like Alex, that, Hey shit

1932
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:32,880
can happen.

1933
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:33,880
Yeah.

1934
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:34,880
And you need to be careful.

1935
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:35,880
You can't talk like this.

1936
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:41,340
You can't, you can't say that Trump needs to get into like an emergency broadcast where

1937
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:45,440
he calls Biden, a terrorist, a Chinese agent.

1938
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,680
And if not, then we need to send a message that we're not going to consent to be governed

1939
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:50,680
anymore.

1940
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:51,680
Yeah.

1941
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:56,920
I mean, I can't think of any way to send a message better than storming the Capitol building.

1942
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:57,920
Yeah.

1943
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,160
But I guess that wasn't good enough is what Mike Adams is saying.

1944
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:02,160
Right.

1945
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,160
Mike.

1946
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,160
So there we go.

1947
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,880
Mike is a real fucked up dude and Alex is really fucked up too.

1948
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:07,880
Yeah.

1949
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,680
But again, he just wants, I mean, largely it's about selling food.

1950
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:11,680
Sure.

1951
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:12,680
Sure.

1952
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:13,680
Sure.

1953
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:16,560
If you're going to buy your storeable food, I'm not going to lie to you.

1954
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,680
I've already started lying and put it and put the trailer up as we speak because I had

1955
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,040
a feeling Trump was going to have it stolen from him.

1956
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:26,920
I'm already moving outside of Austin and already dug a well and the solar panels and all of

1957
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:27,920
it going in.

1958
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:28,920
What's your address?

1959
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:31,480
I mean, this place is all going to be like when Christ pointed and said in 70 years,

1960
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:35,720
none of this, there won't be one stone on the other tie to sacked at 70 years later.

1961
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:38,640
I mean, I'm just telling you now, this is going to be here anymore.

1962
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:39,920
All the cities will be gone.

1963
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,840
So buy your storeable foods.

1964
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:47,200
Um, yeah, Alex keeps having very different stories about whether or not he has this bunker

1965
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,200
set up.

1966
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:49,200
Yeah.

1967
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,200
I don't care.

1968
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:54,280
Um, anyway, we get into more secession talk when we come back from break and uh, Mike,

1969
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:57,240
what he wants to do is he wants Texas, right?

1970
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:58,240
Cause they're cool.

1971
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:59,240
Sure.

1972
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:04,880
He wants them to force social media companies to have like a million dollar fine every time

1973
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,000
they censor somebody to put them out of business.

1974
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,040
And also he wants Texas to make their own money.

1975
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:17,160
Uh, Texas could also pass a new legislation or even via a governor executive order to

1976
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:22,520
say that any instance of censorship by big tech against the citizen of Texas will result

1977
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:25,440
in a $1 million fine against big tech.

1978
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:29,960
And then Texas could use that, uh, well, it would very quickly be at least a trillion

1979
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:31,120
dollars in fines.

1980
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:37,560
Uh, Texas could to defy, uh, the rigged election, Texas could launch its own currency.

1981
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:42,960
And remember, Texas has its own, its own gold, uh, repository that it constructed a few years

1982
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:43,960
ago.

1983
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:47,200
Texas could launch its own currency so that people, and this could happen in any other

1984
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,200
state.

1985
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:51,840
I'm just using Texas as an example so that the people could conduct e-commerce and transactions

1986
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:56,780
in an honest money system owned by the people rather than the fake Fiat currency that Biden

1987
01:28:56,780 --> 01:29:01,600
will use to hand out more bribes and kickbacks to governors like Cuomo and Newsome and so

1988
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:02,600
on.

1989
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,600
It's a great idea.

1990
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,800
Let's have States make their own money.

1991
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,480
Man, have we ever had a situation in American history where different communities printed

1992
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,520
their own money?

1993
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,680
It gets very confusing pretty fast.

1994
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:13,760
Did it work last time?

1995
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:14,760
It didn't.

1996
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:15,760
Oh shit.

1997
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,440
I think we just didn't try it hard enough.

1998
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:21,640
I think that that's what they think about the Confederacy, because it really sounds

1999
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,480
like they just want another Confederacy.

2000
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:24,480
Yeah, yeah.

2001
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:29,600
As you know, Mike, even foreign governments and the IMF World Bank say only Texas could

2002
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:34,080
lead a successful breakaway because of its energy, its oil, its infrastructure, and then

2003
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:41,680
a large constellation of States from Arizona to the West or New Mexico to Colorado to Oklahoma,

2004
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:44,440
Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Florida.

2005
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,520
It would just be instant.

2006
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,000
Texas could reconstitute the Republic.

2007
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,400
Well, absolutely.

2008
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,320
There's a mechanism for doing that.

2009
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:56,600
Texas could elect a new president of the new United States and bring together Louisiana,

2010
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,720
Oklahoma, Kansas, and other States that want to participate.

2011
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:03,640
And then Texas could order its citizens to stop paying federal income taxes to Washington.

2012
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,320
And by the way, this was done before.

2013
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:06,780
We can do it right now.

2014
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:09,380
So yeah, this doesn't sound like a good plan.

2015
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:17,880
So Dan, so if I understand correctly, I'd love to hear your breakdown.

2016
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,960
I mean, I don't want to hear you break down.

2017
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,200
I'd like you to break that down.

2018
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,200
No, no, no.

2019
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,200
I'll break down often.

2020
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,480
I'm already watching you break down.

2021
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,360
I'll break down later.

2022
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:32,280
So Texas is going to declare a new president.

2023
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,280
Yep.

2024
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:40,920
And then, so the United States government is going to watch Texas declare itself a foreign

2025
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:41,920
power.

2026
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:42,920
Yes.

2027
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:43,920
All right.

2028
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,160
And then they're going to be like, well, of course you can have Louisiana and Florida

2029
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,960
naturally because, you know, they would...

2030
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:52,400
Colorado would be thrilled to join up.

2031
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:53,920
Right, right, right, right.

2032
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:59,520
And then they're going to get territory and money from a...

2033
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,360
Oh, I mean, I imagine trade relations would be really wonderful.

2034
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:07,520
Have they ever met the United States?

2035
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:11,240
I feel like there's some issues that they might not be considering.

2036
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,000
Well, I mean, there's that.

2037
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
There's that.

2038
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,800
And I think you make a great point that I also think that there's just a logistical

2039
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,440
issues that they might not be considering.

2040
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,440
Like what?

2041
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:21,440
Trade.

2042
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:22,440
Like trade?

2043
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:23,440
No, no, no, no.

2044
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,840
They're going to be able to sell their oil to foreign powers immediately.

2045
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:30,280
There's no way that they couldn't just immediately start exporting oil.

2046
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:34,160
You know, there's no kind of United States that would be like, hey, that's our money.

2047
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:38,160
So we'll block you from selling this oil because it's ours.

2048
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,160
Yeah.

2049
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,160
There's some problems with this.

2050
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,160
That sounds right.

2051
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,160
But you know what?

2052
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,800
They've got the biggest issue taken care of already.

2053
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:44,800
Sure.

2054
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:45,800
And that is who should be the new president.

2055
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:46,800
Oh, good.

2056
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:52,480
But it's going to be states like Texas and like, you know, Idaho and Wyoming and so on

2057
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:57,920
that are going to really lead, I think, the the new society out of the collapse of the

2058
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:04,080
old corrupt America swamp, the the old empire that's just being looted in its final hour

2059
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,160
by Democrats.

2060
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,160
And maybe you're right.

2061
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:09,120
You know, maybe Trump doesn't want to be at the helm when that happens.

2062
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:14,800
Trump would rather lead the new America out of darkness with a whole new honest money

2063
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:19,800
system, for example, and new laws written for the people, by the people, rather than

2064
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:23,640
for the corrupt criminals that are in the Senate and the GOP.

2065
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:26,720
And by the way, I'm now part of the never GOP movement.

2066
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:31,360
I will not vote for any member of the GOP ever again unless their name is bullshit.

2067
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,480
So that's my statement.

2068
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:34,480
Only Trump.

2069
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:35,480
Bullshit.

2070
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:36,480
All right.

2071
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,480
All right.

2072
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:38,480
Yeah.

2073
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,520
This is fucked up.

2074
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,520
You know what?

2075
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:44,040
I was listening to this and I was like, is Mike Adams more fucked up than I remember

2076
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:45,040
him being?

2077
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,040
I guess.

2078
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:49,600
Maybe it's just because I haven't heard him in a long time, but he seems really fucked

2079
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:50,600
up.

2080
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,920
I mean, he did say that there would only be lone survivors in the past.

2081
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,760
Yeah, but that makes total sense.

2082
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:56,760
That's true.

2083
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:01,720
That's exaggerating a medical situation in order to help sell survival food and shit.

2084
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:03,680
That makes total sense.

2085
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:07,280
Now he's just calling for open secession at the end of the United States.

2086
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:11,300
In the aftermath of people storming the Capitol building.

2087
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:13,200
That's the part that doesn't make sense to me.

2088
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:16,520
This doesn't even work for what Infowars is trying to do.

2089
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:22,680
Here's my vibe from all of them right now, which is that they are a bunch of whiny babies

2090
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:26,840
who want to take their ball and go home after they saw that they lost.

2091
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:30,240
And unfortunately it's not their fucking ball.

2092
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,720
You don't get to just go away.

2093
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,320
And their home is shared.

2094
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:34,320
Yeah, exactly.

2095
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:37,240
We all fucking live there, so you have to deal with it.

2096
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,240
I...

2097
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:39,300
Yeah, it's maddening.

2098
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:42,160
My politics are not divisive, Dan.

2099
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,760
You're trying to murder me.

2100
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,440
There's a difference.

2101
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:52,440
So Mike leaves, and Alex gets to complaining about foreign leaders, but not the ones you

2102
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:53,440
think.

2103
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,000
This time, take shots at Canada.

2104
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Sure.

2105
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Trudeau, you're in the crosshairs.

2106
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Yeah, why not?

2107
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,320
They said we want to end America as an idea.

2108
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:01,880
We want our globalist system.

2109
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:04,020
We want the Chinese system.

2110
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:05,020
We want dictatorship.

2111
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:10,080
So when they tell you they're liberal and they're good and, oh, Alex has hurt people's

2112
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:15,080
feelings and needs to be banned, all the idiots rolling over to tyranny think they're part

2113
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,080
of the power.

2114
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,080
You're not.

2115
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:20,400
You're called useful idiots in the words of VI Lenin.

2116
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,440
So here's what Justin Trudeau had to say.

2117
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:33,760
There's a level of admiration I actually have for China because their basic dictatorship

2118
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:39,360
is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime.

2119
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,360
Let's hear that one more time.

2120
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:43,200
Boy, that clip really cut off abruptly.

2121
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:46,560
It's almost like there would probably be some sort of context to that.

2122
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:47,560
That's weird.

2123
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:48,560
Yeah, it really cut off quick.

2124
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:49,560
Yeah, that was a sharp cut.

2125
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:50,920
Alex has some commentary though.

2126
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:51,920
Oh, okay.

2127
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:55,720
And again, he's asked by a woman in the canned question, what is your favorite politician?

2128
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:56,720
What's your favorite government?

2129
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,800
Oh, it's communist China.

2130
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,160
What's your favorite government?

2131
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,160
They were on a date.

2132
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:02,160
Yeah, yeah.

2133
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:06,200
So first I want to say that these comments were made by Trudeau back in 2013.

2134
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,120
So it's a little old of a clip.

2135
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:12,240
Second, although they're not great comments and they did cause quite a bit of embarrassment

2136
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:15,800
for him, Trudeau didn't actually say that China was his favorite.

2137
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,040
Here's his full answer.

2138
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,040
Okay.

2139
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:21,480
Quote, you know, there's a level of admiration I actually have for China because their basic

2140
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:26,000
dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say,

2141
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,640
we need to go green fastest.

2142
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:29,600
We need to start investing in solar.

2143
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:34,840
I mean, there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about having a dictatorship

2144
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:38,680
that he can do everything he wanted that I find quite interesting.

2145
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:43,040
But if I were to reach out and say which, which kind of administration I most admire,

2146
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:46,280
I think there's something to be said right here in Canada for the way our territories

2147
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:47,280
are run.

2148
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:51,600
Nunavut, Northwestern territories and the Yukon are done without political parties around

2149
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,480
consensus and are much more like a municipal government.

2150
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:59,020
And I think there's a lot to be said for people pulling together to try to solve issues rather

2151
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:00,720
than score points off each other.

2152
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:05,080
And I think we need a little bit more of that, but Sun News can now report that I prefer

2153
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:06,080
China.

2154
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:10,360
So at the end of that quote, he literally said, people are going to do what Alex is

2155
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:11,360
doing right now.

2156
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,360
Cool.

2157
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:13,360
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

2158
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:16,800
The end of the quote is him making a joke about how right-wing media outlets would report

2159
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,680
the story as he loves China.

2160
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,680
Guess what?

2161
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,600
Seven years later, Alex, fulfilling the prophecy.

2162
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:23,600
Yep.

2163
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:30,600
I don't know if anybody who studies government would disagree with the idea that a centralized

2164
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:34,480
monarchical power structure allows for quicker reaction times.

2165
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:37,600
Yeah, I mean, if you're saying it- You don't have to get a bunch of people together

2166
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:38,600
and vote.

2167
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:39,600
Yeah.

2168
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,040
If you're saying it outside of it being a prescriptive thing, like we should have that

2169
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:43,040
because- No, no, no.

2170
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:46,000
If you're just studying it, then you'd be like, well, yeah, obviously, because that

2171
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,980
guy just gets to say, do this instead of being like, well, we need to talk to our constituents

2172
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:54,640
and we need to have a vote and we need to write a bill and do all that stuff.

2173
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:55,640
Yeah.

2174
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:56,640
Descriptively, it's pretty hard to argue with.

2175
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:57,640
Yeah.

2176
01:36:57,640 --> 01:37:02,440
But yeah, if you listen to the rest of that quote, it's really clear the thing that he's

2177
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:10,820
bringing up is that phenomenon, how they can make their economy much more eco-friendly

2178
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:16,280
because of that basic dictatorship, as he calls it, but the government that he actually

2179
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:21,120
says is what he admires is the territories in Canada.

2180
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:25,480
It's a completely different message than what Alex wants to give across because he's a liar

2181
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:26,920
and he might not even know.

2182
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:27,920
Yeah.

2183
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,920
I bet he doesn't even know what the rest of that quote is.

2184
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:30,920
Doesn't care.

2185
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:31,920
Doesn't care.

2186
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:32,920
That's bullshit.

2187
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:35,200
He just listened to the Sun News report that he liked China.

2188
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:36,200
That's all you need.

2189
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,200
Yeah.

2190
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:42,440
So anyway, these people who like Q, they're fucking stupid because they think that they're

2191
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:46,600
talking to military intelligence and that's what Alex keeps...

2192
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:50,800
He keeps running into people at events and they're like...

2193
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,120
Like Zack?

2194
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:57,400
I've literally been at rallies and they always have this weird look like they're in a trance.

2195
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,400
They walk over all...

2196
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:02,440
It's always like a guy wearing a Q shirt and he goes, Alex, I used to like you, but now

2197
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:06,360
I'm with Q. I know you're bad.

2198
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:11,520
And then they'll always go, army intelligence, I'm with the intelligence.

2199
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:16,640
You're like, well, really that's funny because the highest levels of army intelligence call

2200
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:22,400
up and ask me what's coming next and so does the FBI, those that are good, and you think

2201
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:28,060
there's like some magic mountain up there, the president calls us to see what we think.

2202
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:31,880
So he's making fun of these people for thinking they're talking to military intelligence and

2203
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:35,280
then he immediately starts talking about how he's the one who talks to military intelligence.

2204
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:39,320
All I hear him say is just like, I know I'm lying.

2205
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:41,120
You guys believe what you're saying.

2206
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:43,760
I know I'm lying because I'm not stupid.

2207
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,440
I can weaponize this stuff.

2208
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:46,440
You guys are following.

2209
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2210
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:48,440
Don't you think?

2211
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:50,920
You're not making any money off of this bullshit.

2212
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,640
You should be giving me money.

2213
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:53,640
I hate them.

2214
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:58,400
So he's just fed up with these Q folks, but it's really important to understand that the

2215
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:02,960
reason that he's behaving in the way he is towards them and about this whole narrative

2216
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:07,240
is throwing them under the bus because he needs somebody to be the people who had the

2217
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:08,320
zip ties.

2218
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:13,240
He needs somebody to be the people who are scary and he's taught his audience not really

2219
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,600
to be afraid of seeing Jean wearing Antifa.

2220
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,160
So I assume he's going to denounce the Oath Keepers, right?

2221
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,160
No.

2222
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,160
Oh.

2223
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,160
I have arguments with family.

2224
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:27,480
I have arguments with so many people where they believed all that delusional crap and

2225
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:29,800
it really defeated us.

2226
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:33,920
And then now I see how it's a robot army they control through 8chan who will do violence

2227
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:42,400
and now they're planning to attack a bunch of the capitals during the 20th, which denies

2228
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:47,340
us the ability to actually protest peacefully because they're going to have Qtards out there

2229
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:52,200
with their zip ties and their guns, believing they're about to overthrow the globalists

2230
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:57,440
and they're being secretly commanded by some magic group that is the globalist.

2231
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:04,800
Q thinks it's good, but it's commanded by the enemy for sure.

2232
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:14,840
And it's roped in so many people that are now delusional.

2233
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:21,000
All I want, man, you know, I really figured things out in the last couple of days.

2234
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,880
I kind of went next level and I already knew all of this, but now I'm totally in the dialectic.

2235
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:28,400
I get the whole Machiavellian plan even better.

2236
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:29,400
Stab yourself in the ears.

2237
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:31,060
I'm sure they're operating according to it.

2238
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:32,060
With chopsticks.

2239
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:36,320
And God, is it diabolical.

2240
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,320
Absolutely diabolical.

2241
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,720
What?

2242
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:42,120
Oh, man.

2243
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:53,160
And people take kindness for weakness.

2244
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:54,160
And I just can't believe it.

2245
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,160
I've always been so loyal.

2246
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:56,160
I'm such a loyal person.

2247
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:58,200
The people that treat me good, I treat them good.

2248
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,480
And I've just experienced so many people that don't treat me like that.

2249
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:03,880
But I finally, through the years of working hard to found a crew that treats me loyally,

2250
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:05,120
I treat them loyally as I can.

2251
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:06,120
I appreciate them.

2252
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:11,600
But I've gotten to a point at 47 years old that I can't take this loyalty anymore.

2253
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:12,600
And rat bastardness.

2254
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:13,600
You know, I was watching...

2255
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,600
Next, we have Roger Stone.

2256
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:16,600
They're only blind hands, you know.

2257
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:17,600
I just go with my wife.

2258
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:18,600
What are we doing?

2259
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:19,600
What are we doing?

2260
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:20,600
I don't know.

2261
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:21,600
I don't know.

2262
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:25,800
I wouldn't expect that Alex would like, ah, I finally get it.

2263
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:26,800
Now.

2264
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:27,800
Yeah.

2265
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:28,800
Yeah.

2266
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:29,800
He's supposed to have known all of this.

2267
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:30,800
It just makes me want to start barking.

2268
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:31,800
Yeah.

2269
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:32,800
No, totally.

2270
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,840
I almost just broke down and just started going, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff.

2271
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:37,840
Yeah.

2272
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:38,840
Yeah.

2273
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:40,280
It's so nonsensical.

2274
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:44,400
Those moments when he's just like, oh, I see everything in the dialectic.

2275
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,960
I went next level recently.

2276
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,040
It's just like, get a journal.

2277
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:50,040
Yeah.

2278
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:51,040
Yeah.

2279
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:58,560
I mean, it does go a long way towards explaining how he tells himself he's not a serial killer.

2280
01:41:58,560 --> 01:41:59,560
You know.

2281
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:00,560
No, no, no.

2282
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:01,560
I just got it.

2283
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:02,560
I've seen something new.

2284
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:03,560
I'm not a serial killer.

2285
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:04,560
It's a different thing.

2286
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,040
Well, we know that he's taken responsibility for multiple killings.

2287
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,040
Yeah.

2288
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,040
In the past.

2289
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:12,120
I don't know if he can talk himself out of that one.

2290
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:13,120
I don't know.

2291
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:18,360
Anyway, these Q people, they were at the Capitol and they trained themselves to think that

2292
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:20,920
Trump was going to send the special forces in, right?

2293
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:25,360
And so they saw Antifa and they thought that they were the special forces.

2294
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:27,240
This is the story now.

2295
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:32,680
It was the Q people under Antifa's control who went in there like a group of morons.

2296
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:35,400
Antifa breaches it, they start it.

2297
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:39,040
The Q people thought there's the special forces right on time.

2298
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,840
They told us to invade at this time.

2299
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:41,880
They would attack first.

2300
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:46,880
And they thought Antifa was special forces for Trump breaking into the Capitol.

2301
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,980
So they then flooded in behind waving in the masses.

2302
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:55,800
But luckily by the blessing of God, 99% of the hundreds of thousands did not go in with

2303
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:58,340
them.

2304
01:42:58,340 --> 01:43:00,560
But I saw that and it made me sick.

2305
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:01,560
Yeah.

2306
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:07,720
And this is, I guess, how the narrative is going to land is the Q people thought that

2307
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:12,200
Antifa were special forces, but I thought that they were being directed by the deep

2308
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:13,200
state also.

2309
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,600
Like, what's going on here?

2310
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:15,600
Yeah.

2311
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,480
Yeah, Dan, what is going on here?

2312
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:18,480
I don't know.

2313
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:19,480
Bunch of nonsense.

2314
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:22,280
It's everybody's fault but mine.

2315
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:24,280
I'm blameless.

2316
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:28,800
Now excuse me while me and my health ranger friend try and make this happen again.

2317
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,800
Stir up a rebellion.

2318
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:31,800
Hey.

2319
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:36,320
So I told you there would be hypnosis involved and Alex does go to calls.

2320
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,080
You did promise to be hypnosis, Dan.

2321
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:41,840
He wanted to talk to people who were there and one guy believes that...

2322
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:44,120
Give them your name and address, please.

2323
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:45,320
You were there?

2324
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:48,320
Well, maybe not inside, but at the rally.

2325
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:52,980
And there's one guy who calls in who believes that there was a guy on a megaphone who is

2326
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:55,120
basically hypnotizing the crowd.

2327
01:43:55,120 --> 01:44:00,360
Alex, do you remember the media tower right there up front and center in the back?

2328
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:01,360
Yeah.

2329
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,040
There was someone on that megaphone.

2330
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:07,640
I know a little bit about neuro-linguistic programming, NLP.

2331
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:14,120
Whoever was on that megaphone was literally, by the power of suggestion, hitting all those

2332
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,880
trigger words, take it now, people.

2333
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,360
It's now or never.

2334
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:19,560
This is China.

2335
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:21,560
This is our house.

2336
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,560
Storm it.

2337
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:23,560
Push forward.

2338
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:24,560
Hold the line.

2339
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,420
They were saying everything that would rile anyone...

2340
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:32,760
And also read they said Alex Jones and Trump say so, did you hear that?

2341
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:37,120
I did not say that, but I hear that, but I can tell you what I felt and the things that

2342
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,120
I did hear.

2343
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:41,720
So this guy is saying that someone was using neuro-linguistic programming to convince the

2344
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:44,500
crowd to act in ways that it wouldn't have.

2345
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:48,240
But I also think that all the things that he's saying, the person said, are exactly

2346
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:52,700
what they would be saying in a bullhorn.

2347
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:54,940
You guys want this.

2348
01:44:54,940 --> 01:45:00,400
You're just mad because it happened before you could get enough people together to succeed.

2349
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,420
That's what's angering them.

2350
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:05,600
And you're gonna be mad when people start to take this seriously.

2351
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,600
Yeah.

2352
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:09,100
You're gonna be real mad whenever you start to get it.

2353
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:15,360
For a very long time, people have not taken the issue of right-wing media and how it feeds

2354
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:18,320
into extremism.

2355
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:23,880
They've not taken that seriously at all, which is, I mean, why we have any relevance.

2356
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:30,480
Why there's any reason for a show like ours to exist is because no one takes it seriously.

2357
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:31,480
Yeah, exactly.

2358
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:37,360
And I think that there is an unfortunate, for them, trend, and that is that people may

2359
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:39,600
take this seriously now, and that's threatening.

2360
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:40,600
Yeah.

2361
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:41,600
It'll be good, though.

2362
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:50,680
Because imagine if somebody was like, I don't know, on every TV show just sitting there

2363
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:55,620
being like, hey, hey, that's bullshit, next.

2364
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:56,620
You know?

2365
01:45:56,620 --> 01:45:59,760
Just like, hey, strike that from the fucking show, next.

2366
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:04,400
That's why I think I speculated about this back in the day, and I actually don't think

2367
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:10,240
this would be a good idea, but if Alex is going to do his show, I have to be his co-host.

2368
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:11,240
You have to.

2369
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:12,240
Totally.

2370
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:13,240
Totally.

2371
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:14,240
That's his version of net neutrality.

2372
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:15,920
You need a fucking shot caller.

2373
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:16,920
That's what you need.

2374
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:21,040
And there's some other callers who talk about boring stuff, about being there at the rally.

2375
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:25,120
I didn't find any of it too interesting, but there's one other caller that made me chuckle.

2376
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:27,120
You know, you do have an alternative.

2377
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:28,120
It's called magazines.

2378
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:32,440
You need to start a magazine to where we can leave it at dentist's office, Walmart, call

2379
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:34,280
it Lifestyle of the Free.

2380
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:35,280
And that's-

2381
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,280
You know, I tried a magazine, sir.

2382
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,120
Lifestyle of the Free sounds great.

2383
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:42,840
Do you understand that it had one one-millionth the response of a digital format?

2384
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:46,560
Yeah, but the digital format is not doing anything either.

2385
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:47,560
Look what it done.

2386
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:48,560
The country's still going down.

2387
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:49,560
I appreciate your call, sir.

2388
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:51,800
I've got to hang up on this asshole.

2389
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:54,560
Dan, here's my solution.

2390
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:55,560
Yeah.

2391
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:56,560
Print media!

2392
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:57,560
Yeah.

2393
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:00,840
This guy, I love that call because he's like, yeah, you know, we need magazines.

2394
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:05,200
Look, I've done a magazine, cost a lot of money, didn't make anything off it.

2395
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:06,200
No one gave a shit.

2396
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:07,200
Do you know anything about the publishing business?

2397
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:08,200
Yeah, yeah.

2398
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:09,200
It's a loss.

2399
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:10,200
It's bad.

2400
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:11,200
I'm just going to throw money in a pit.

2401
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:12,200
Yeah.

2402
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:14,980
And hey, look, the digital stuff, lots more people see it.

2403
01:47:14,980 --> 01:47:17,320
And the caller's response to that is amazing.

2404
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:19,200
Digital stuff's not doing anything either.

2405
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:22,600
Yeah, which, fair point, fair point, sir.

2406
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:25,800
Alex can't reply to that, so he hangs up.

2407
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:26,800
Get rid of that guy.

2408
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:27,800
You're fucking worthless.

2409
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:28,800
That's what's happening.

2410
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:29,800
Yeah.

2411
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:33,320
So we come to the end of this and, you know, we needed to do Wednesday episode because

2412
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:38,360
this is a pretty fucked up, but at the same time, it's like, you know, we, if we waited

2413
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:42,520
until Friday, this would pile up and there wouldn't be, and who knows what's going to

2414
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:49,760
happen tomorrow or, you know, this is, we're not a news show, but the news backs up fast

2415
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:50,760
now.

2416
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:53,920
We've already, we've already forgotten that Alex interviewed Mike Flynn.

2417
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:54,920
Yeah.

2418
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:55,920
Yeah.

2419
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:56,920
Who gives a fuck about that?

2420
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:57,920
Who gives a fuck about that shit?

2421
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:58,920
Yeah.

2422
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,560
So, um, anyway, we'll see what happens.

2423
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:02,880
I'm sorry to do this to you.

2424
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:03,880
Yeah.

2425
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:04,880
You're worked up in a tizzy.

2426
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:10,840
Yeah, I'm not, I'm not, you get to process all of this and then the show and you have

2427
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:15,180
to edit it, you know, and that's, that's, but I, I'm just shaking with rage and then

2428
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:17,920
I walk away into the night.

2429
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:20,580
Some would argue that your job is easier in that sense.

2430
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:21,580
Some would argue that.

2431
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:25,040
I think you're describing me having to live with this stuff for a lot longer.

2432
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:26,040
Exactly.

2433
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:28,280
But you're better able to emotionally process it, Dan.

2434
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:30,120
I'm a loose cannon.

2435
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:32,360
Somebody should take my gun and badge away right now.

2436
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:35,960
Well, good thing you have neither a gun nor a badge.

2437
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:36,960
That's true.

2438
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:37,960
Yeah.

2439
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:38,960
That is true.

2440
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:39,960
That is a bonus.

2441
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:43,520
If you're not able to emotionally handle this much better, it's that I steal all the candy

2442
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:45,520
that our listeners send us.

2443
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:46,520
That's what gets you through.

2444
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:47,520
Yeah, exactly.

2445
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:49,520
If I got some of that candy, I wouldn't be shaking with rage right now, Dan.

2446
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:50,720
Well, I need it all.

2447
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:52,680
So unfortunately, no candy.

2448
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:55,120
Well, you're the more valuable resource.

2449
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:56,120
Fine.

2450
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:58,920
So we'll be back on Friday, Jordan, but until then we have a website.

2451
01:48:58,920 --> 01:48:59,920
We do.

2452
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:00,920
It's knowledgefight.com.

2453
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:01,920
Yep.

2454
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:02,920
We're also on Twitter.

2455
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:03,920
We are on Twitter.

2456
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:04,920
It's at knowledge underscore fight and that go to bed Jordan.

2457
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:05,920
Yes.

2458
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,920
We're on Facebook.

2459
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:07,920
We are on Facebook.

2460
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:11,720
If you could please find a local charity or a bail fund in your area to help out people

2461
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:13,360
who are still doing God's work.

2462
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:14,360
Yep.

2463
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:15,360
We'll be back.

2464
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:16,360
But until then, I'm Neo.

2465
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:17,360
I'm Leo.

2466
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:18,360
I'm DZX Clark.

2467
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:20,440
I'm the juiciest ice cube.

2468
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:21,440
Andy in Kansas.

2469
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:22,440
You're on the air.

2470
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:23,440
Thanks for holding.

2471
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:24,440
Hello, Alex.

2472
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:25,440
I'm a first time caller.

2473
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:26,440
I'm a huge fan.

2474
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:27,440
I love your work.

2475
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:55,440
I love you.
