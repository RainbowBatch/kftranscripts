00:00.000 --> 00:23.360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys, a knowledge

00:23.360 --> 00:24.360
fight.

00:24.360 --> 00:30.320
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys, a knowledge

00:30.320 --> 00:31.320
fight.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.320
Dan and Jordan, knowledge fight.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.320
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

00:33.320 --> 00:34.320
Need, I need money.

00:34.320 --> 00:35.320
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

00:35.320 --> 00:36.320
Andy and Candace, Andy and Candace.

00:36.320 --> 00:37.320
Stop it.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.320
Andy and Candace, Andy and Candace.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.320
It's time to pray.

00:39.320 --> 00:40.320
Andy and Candace, you're on the air.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.320
Thanks for holding us.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.320
Hello, Alex.

00:42.320 --> 00:43.320
I'm a first-time caller.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.320
I'm a huge fan.

00:44.320 --> 00:45.320
I love your room.

00:45.320 --> 00:46.320
Knowledge fight.

00:46.320 --> 00:55.320
Knowledgefight.com.

00:55.320 --> 00:59.320
I love you.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.320
Hey, everybody.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.320
Welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.320
I'm Dan.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.320
I'm Jordan.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.320
We're cool dudes.

01:04.320 --> 01:06.040
I like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.400
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.400
Jordan.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.400
Dan.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.400
Jordan.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.400
I have a quick question for you.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.400
What's up?

01:12.400 --> 01:13.400
What's your bright spot today?

01:13.400 --> 01:14.400
My bright spot today, Jordan, is hoodies.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.400
Hoodies?

01:15.400 --> 01:16.400
I got a new hoodie.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.400
You did get a new hoodie?

01:17.400 --> 01:18.400
Mm-hmm.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.400
Oh, Miskatonic University.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.400
Is that a real place?

01:20.400 --> 01:21.400
Arkham, Massachusetts.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.400
Oh.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.400
What happened?

01:23.400 --> 01:24.400
That's Lovecraft University.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.400
Yeah, I imagine so.

01:25.400 --> 01:30.120
Yeah, it takes me forever to buy clothes.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.840
I just never end up doing it.

01:31.840 --> 01:36.080
I've had the same clothes forever, and I've needed some new hoodies.

01:36.080 --> 01:39.400
It's winter, basically wearing a sweater pretty much every day.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.920
And so I've added some spice to my life.

01:42.920 --> 01:43.920
I like it.

01:43.920 --> 01:49.200
And this one, I got also another one that's at the Miskatonic University Antarctic Expedition.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.200
Sure, sure.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.360
That's the Mountains of Madness reference.

01:52.360 --> 01:56.360
Very, very... I got too much Lovecraft hoodies.

01:56.360 --> 01:57.360
No, no.

01:57.360 --> 01:58.360
You're golden.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.360
You're golden, Dan.

01:59.360 --> 02:03.680
I just couldn't decide on anything that I wanted to get that would be like, I can handle

02:03.680 --> 02:06.400
wearing this in public, and it's something that I like.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.400
Yeah.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.640
Like, I can wear this, and no one would look twice at it, but if it was like Cthulhu or

02:10.640 --> 02:11.640
something- Sure, sure, sure.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.240
I would feel very uncomfortable.

02:14.240 --> 02:17.960
People would have to do a double take, and then they'd be like, oh, I get it.

02:17.960 --> 02:18.960
Yeah.

02:18.960 --> 02:19.960
Otherwise, it just looks like it's a college hoodie.

02:19.960 --> 02:20.960
It's a normal college shirt.

02:20.960 --> 02:21.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:21.960 --> 02:22.960
Absolutely.

02:22.960 --> 02:23.960
So I made that compromise.

02:23.960 --> 02:27.200
That's better than what I do with clothes, which is just every six months, I buy five

02:27.200 --> 02:29.700
different colors of the same shirt and wear it.

02:29.700 --> 02:30.700
That's not too bad.

02:30.700 --> 02:35.160
I think that there's a lot of decision paralysis that you get rid of when you do that.

02:35.160 --> 02:36.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:36.240 --> 02:41.240
When you model your clothing choices on Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes, I think it solves

02:41.240 --> 02:44.400
a lot of problems before they begin.

02:44.400 --> 02:48.240
Yeah, yeah, because then you're just like, oh, grab this same thing, put it on.

02:48.240 --> 02:49.240
It's a great shirt.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.820
This one's blue, and the other one's teal.

02:50.820 --> 02:51.820
It's a different shirt.

02:51.820 --> 02:52.820
Yeah.

02:52.820 --> 02:53.820
So Jordan, how about you?

02:53.820 --> 02:54.820
What's your bright spot?

02:54.820 --> 03:01.120
My bright spot, Dan, was this year, they just ended the GDQ for 2021.

03:01.120 --> 03:06.840
They just ended Games Done Quick, and it was a bunch of fantastic stuff, a lot of good

03:06.840 --> 03:14.560
runs, and they raised over two million even in this kind of fucking year, so that's really,

03:14.560 --> 03:15.560
really cool.

03:15.560 --> 03:16.560
That is cool.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.560
It made me happy.

03:17.560 --> 03:18.560
That is a lot of fun.

03:18.560 --> 03:19.560
So it's a bright spot.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.560
Yeah.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.800
I'm still wishy-washy a tiny bit about watching video games.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.880
I can watch some of the people who put up Mario Maker videos.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.360
See, those are the ones that I watch.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.360
Yeah.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.360
Because those are so hard.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.360
Oh, yeah.

03:32.360 --> 03:36.000
It's offensive almost how hard those levels are that people make.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Yeah, no.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Because that's the point.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.080
That was one of the things this year, I don't think it closed it, but it was one of the

03:42.080 --> 03:47.880
last four runs, and this dude was playing the hardest Mario Maker level that wasn't

03:47.880 --> 03:48.880
even Mario Maker.

03:48.880 --> 03:49.880
It was a hack.

03:49.880 --> 03:56.360
It was a kaizo hack, and the previous world record was 35 minutes, and he did it in 18.

03:56.360 --> 03:57.360
Wow.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.240
And everybody's watching that just going like, what the fuck just happened, man?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.240
We just saw history.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.560
And nobody even registered for a while.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.480
They were like, that was just a really good run, man.

04:07.480 --> 04:11.520
I think part of my concern is that I think I might get too into it.

04:11.520 --> 04:16.560
I might enjoy watching people play video games competitively too much, but I just can't.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.560
I can't do it.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.560
Right, right, right.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.360
I don't want to enter the territory lest I disappear into it.

04:21.360 --> 04:26.560
Yeah, it's one of those things where I've never been that good at platforming games,

04:26.560 --> 04:29.980
so they've always seemed like a struggle whenever I play them.

04:29.980 --> 04:34.680
And then whenever you see these guys play them, it's actually a very kind of beautiful,

04:34.680 --> 04:37.860
almost dancing kind of feel where it's like, oh, I get it.

04:37.860 --> 04:43.120
If you just do all of the steps perfectly, it's pretty to watch.

04:43.120 --> 04:46.800
It's like if you're bad at dancing and then you watch Somebody's Good, you're like, oh,

04:46.800 --> 04:47.800
I get it.

04:47.800 --> 04:48.800
That's what it's supposed to look like.

04:48.800 --> 04:49.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:49.800 --> 04:50.800
For sure.

04:50.800 --> 04:51.800
Yeah.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.200
So something that's not how it's supposed to be is the world.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.200
Yeah.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.200
Well.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.200
Smooth.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.200
Fucking transition.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.200
You're great.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.200
It's a mess.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.200
It's a mess.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.200
And so that's why we're here on a Wednesday.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.200
It does seem like that.

05:03.200 --> 05:07.360
Doing a little special middle of the week episode, because we got to keep on top of

05:07.360 --> 05:08.360
things.

05:08.360 --> 05:12.080
We figured it'd be too much if we waited till Friday, things would pile up and they may

05:12.080 --> 05:13.080
be important.

05:13.080 --> 05:17.440
So we're going over January 10th and 11th today, 2021.

05:17.440 --> 05:20.440
I don't have anything to say about 2021 yet.

05:20.440 --> 05:21.440
Not yet.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.440
Nope.

05:22.440 --> 05:23.440
We'll figure that out.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.680
I think this is 2021.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.840
I'm Dan and there will only be lone survivors.

05:27.840 --> 05:28.840
No.

05:28.840 --> 05:29.840
Nope.

05:29.840 --> 05:30.840
I feel like that one's pretty good.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.760
Today we're going to be going over January 10th and 11th, 2021.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.760
I'm Dan.

05:34.760 --> 05:35.760
This is no longer 2020.

05:35.760 --> 05:36.760
Oh, okay.

05:36.760 --> 05:37.760
Nah, that's not good.

05:37.760 --> 05:38.760
That's not that good.

05:38.760 --> 05:39.760
Nah, it didn't feel that good.

05:39.760 --> 05:40.760
Nah, it didn't feel right.

05:40.760 --> 05:41.760
We'll come up with something.

05:41.760 --> 05:42.760
Okay.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.640
But yeah, there's a lot of, lot of horseshit on this episode.

05:45.640 --> 05:49.680
And actually we get a really interesting return from somebody who's been out of pocket for

05:49.680 --> 05:50.680
a while.

05:50.680 --> 05:51.680
All right.

05:51.680 --> 05:54.320
There's somebody who we have not heard hide nor hair of.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.320
Health Ranger?

05:55.320 --> 05:56.320
Seen?

05:56.320 --> 05:57.320
Hide nor hair of?

05:57.320 --> 05:58.320
I'm not sure what the expression is.

05:58.320 --> 05:59.320
Okay.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.320
Okay.

06:00.320 --> 06:01.320
Well, we'll see what happens.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.320
How'd you hear a hide or a hair?

06:02.320 --> 06:03.320
Yeah.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.320
That's kind of what I was concerned about.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.320
I'm not entirely sure.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.320
Okay.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.320
But we'll get down to business on that here in a second.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.560
But first, Jordan, we're going to take a little moment to say thank you to some folks who

06:09.560 --> 06:11.240
have signed up and are supporting the show.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.240
That's a great idea.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.880
So first, don't dare call me a policy wonk.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.400
You are now a policy wonk.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.480
I'm a policy wonk.

06:16.480 --> 06:17.480
Take that.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.480
Thank you.

06:18.480 --> 06:19.480
Next, Nina Z.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.480
Thank you so much.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.480
You are now a policy wonk.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.480
I'm a policy wonk.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.480
Thanks, Nina.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.480
Thank you.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.480
Next, Finn B. Not Finn Balor.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.480
Thank you so much.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.480
You are now a policy wonk.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.480
I'm a policy wonk.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.480
Thanks, Finn.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.480
Next, Tom K. And it's T-H-O-M, which I enjoy quite a bit.

06:32.480 --> 06:33.480
Oh, okay.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.480
So it's not Tom Kenny?

06:34.480 --> 06:35.480
No.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.480
Oh, damn.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.480
Tom K., you are now a policy wonk.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.480
I'm a policy wonk.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.480
Thank you.

06:39.480 --> 06:40.480
Thanks, Tom K.

06:40.480 --> 06:41.480
I like that thom.

06:41.480 --> 06:42.480
Yeah.

06:42.480 --> 06:43.480
Yeah.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.480
I don't know why.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.480
You don't know why?

06:45.480 --> 06:46.840
If I were Thomas and I went by Tom, I'd definitely keep that H in there.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.800
You'd like the old English H in there.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.800
Yeah.

06:49.800 --> 06:50.800
I enjoy it.

06:50.800 --> 06:51.800
Okay.

06:51.800 --> 06:52.800
Next, Michelle H. Thank you so much.

06:52.800 --> 06:53.800
You are now a policy wonk.

06:53.800 --> 06:54.800
I'm a policy wonk.

06:54.800 --> 06:59.800
Thank you. Next, Snug Doo with Rob Doo, which I think is the new morning show on Infowars.

06:59.800 --> 07:00.800
Okay.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.160
You are now a policy wonk.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.160
I'm a policy wonk.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.160
Thank you.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.160
Thank you.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.600
And then finally, I'd like to thank a couple of people who donated on an elevated level.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.760
I appreciate that very much.

07:08.760 --> 07:11.160
So, the Giuliani Brain Trust.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.160
Thank you so much.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.160
You are now a technocrat.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.600
And Kelly M. Thank you so much.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.840
You are now a technocrat.

07:15.840 --> 07:16.840
I'm a policy wonk.

07:16.840 --> 07:17.840
Crikey, mate.

07:17.840 --> 07:18.840
That's fantastic.

07:18.840 --> 07:19.840
Have yourself a brew.

07:19.840 --> 07:20.840
How's your 401k doing, bro?

07:20.840 --> 07:21.840
All right.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.240
We got to go full tilt boogie on this Watson, all right?

07:24.240 --> 07:25.720
Let's just get down to business.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.800
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.720
Why are you pimps so good?

07:29.720 --> 07:31.360
My neck is freakishly large.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.080
I declare Infowar on you.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.720
Thank you so much, Giuliani Brain Trust, and thank you, Kelly M.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.720
Yes.

07:37.720 --> 07:38.720
Thank you very much to the both of you.

07:38.720 --> 07:42.120
We have another special little shout out to give today.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.120
All right.

07:43.120 --> 07:47.000
And first, I'd like to give a shout out to Wednesday and Biscuits, who are a couple of

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
cats.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Oh, okay.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.360
That are just apparently adorable.

07:50.360 --> 07:51.360
They're very sweet.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.360
Oh, okay.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.360
I got you.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.600
But I'll take the owner's word for them.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.600
And here's the thing.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.360
I would also give a shout out to the concept of Wednesday and to Biscuits.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.480
I prefer Biscuits to Wednesdays.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.480
That's fair.

08:03.480 --> 08:04.480
Biscuits are great.

08:04.480 --> 08:05.480
Oh, you ever go...

08:05.480 --> 08:07.880
First of all, Cheddar Bay Biscuits, fantastic.

08:07.880 --> 08:08.880
Wrong.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.480
Second best biscuit I think is Cracker Barrel.

08:10.480 --> 08:11.480
They have great biscuits.

08:11.480 --> 08:12.480
That's pretty great.

08:12.480 --> 08:13.480
Oh, buttermilk.

08:13.480 --> 08:14.520
That's pretty great.

08:14.520 --> 08:18.720
So Wednesday and Biscuits are a couple of cats, and the people who take care of them,

08:18.720 --> 08:22.800
I guess feed them, house them, are Kara and Andrew.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.800
Okay.

08:23.800 --> 08:29.240
And I got reached out to because at the end of last year, two of them tied the knot.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.240
Oh, congratulations.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.240
Got married.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.280
Congratulations to the both of them.

08:33.280 --> 08:40.520
And I got a message hoping for a happy one month anniversary message in December.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.520
We can't do that.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.520
Missed that message.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.520
No, we don't do that.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.520
Missed that message.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.760
In December, we didn't speak to anyone.

08:45.760 --> 08:46.760
No.

08:46.760 --> 08:52.000
I feel very bad about that though, so I want to make it up and wish a happy two month anniversary

08:52.000 --> 08:53.720
to Kara and Andrew.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.040
Happy anniversary to you both.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.040
Ah, man.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.960
You should have hung onto it for a full year.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.520
In December, we could have been like, ha!

09:01.520 --> 09:03.400
You thought we forgot, assholes!

09:03.400 --> 09:04.400
Happy one year anniversary!

09:04.400 --> 09:06.800
See, now the problem with that is I almost certainly would have forgotten.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.680
We would absolutely have forgotten.

09:08.680 --> 09:09.680
Yeah.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.080
I doubt the internet will be around at the end of this year.

09:12.080 --> 09:15.080
Give Wednesday and Biscuits some treats to celebrate.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.320
Hope you all are having a great day.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.320
Indeed.

09:18.320 --> 09:24.360
Hey Jordan, today, let's start here on January 10th.

09:24.360 --> 09:30.440
Alex seems to be looking at the world and he's seeing like, hey, a lot of people are

09:30.440 --> 09:32.160
saying I'm right about stuff now.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.160
Oh, that's not good.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.160
They shouldn't do that.

09:34.160 --> 09:39.000
The internet is really waking up, meaning the people are really waking up, and the saying

09:39.000 --> 09:49.200
Alex Jones was right is being written on the walls, spray painted on the government buildings,

09:49.200 --> 09:55.960
festooned to people's t-shirts and typed in to Twitter and Facebook accounts by the millions

09:55.960 --> 09:57.200
a day.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.200
And it's become a maxim.

09:58.200 --> 10:05.320
And I'm very honored that the fact that I predicted all of this and now we're getting

10:05.320 --> 10:09.680
the credit for it only because I want people to then realize that we know what's coming

10:09.680 --> 10:10.680
next.

10:10.680 --> 10:15.880
Uh, probably nuking a city is what he's going to predict, but, uh, I too would be honored

10:15.880 --> 10:23.000
to have, uh, uh, Jordan was right directly next to, for a good time called Clarice.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.840
I think that would give me a lot of honor, you know, that would make me feel good.

10:26.840 --> 10:29.840
I think Alex is just responding to the fact that a bunch of people got kicked off social

10:29.840 --> 10:30.840
media.

10:30.840 --> 10:31.840
That would make sense.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.960
And he's like, yeah, I told you they're going to kick you off social media if you keep behaving

10:34.960 --> 10:37.000
in the ways that gay people kicked off social media.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.520
Oh, what an amazing prediction.

10:39.520 --> 10:47.240
Um, I think that I personally would never like to be in a situation where I'm celebrating

10:47.240 --> 10:53.320
something that I said or did, uh, being memorialized in a way that I decided to call it festooned.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:54.920 --> 10:55.920
That's not good.

10:55.920 --> 11:00.200
If you ever catch me slipping and I use that term to be like, my words are festooned on

11:00.200 --> 11:05.200
billboards, uh, I'm not doing well.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.200
Things have gone bad.

11:06.200 --> 11:10.040
My words emanate from the excrement of the ground, Dan.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.040
Oh boy.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.040
Yeah.

11:12.040 --> 11:16.520
But, uh, you know, he's, uh, claimed, uh, on our previous episodes, Alex has, uh, laid

11:16.520 --> 11:21.120
out the, the, uh, the foundation for the Antifa did the storming of the Capitol.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.120
Yeah, that's great.

11:22.120 --> 11:26.280
I like, uh, I like getting people killed who had nothing to do with it and, uh, it's your

11:26.280 --> 11:27.280
fault.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.280
Sure.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.600
And now Alex is, uh, he's proved it.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.600
Oh, good.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.600
He's good.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.600
Hear that.

11:32.600 --> 11:33.600
Let me hear it.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.280
That's the globalist that maneuvered us to destruction.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.440
We slipped Trump in there.

11:37.440 --> 11:44.400
He valiantly fought to at least keep the country sovereign and now they hired provocateurs.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.400
We've proven this.

11:45.400 --> 11:50.640
We have a report coming up at the end of the hour with all the evidence, two out of a million

11:50.640 --> 11:57.480
demonstrators at the white house, the elliptical, the Washington monument stretched all the

11:57.480 --> 12:04.840
way down to the Capitol, some other paramilitary groups were still identifying, showed up,

12:04.840 --> 12:07.160
attacked the police.

12:07.160 --> 12:11.100
And then the police on the other sides of the Capitol opened it up to the general public.

12:11.100 --> 12:16.160
There was very little violence, very little attacks, except for a few people that were

12:16.160 --> 12:23.480
provocateurs and who they were able to manipulate to go along with them, some useful idiots.

12:23.480 --> 12:28.200
They videotaped with antifa camera people we've identified in every case, the National

12:28.200 --> 12:35.240
Geographic camera people, the few violent events to then say that the Capitol was stormed

12:35.240 --> 12:42.760
by terrorists, quote, and then the Capitol has fallen to the Patriots, Joe Biden end

12:42.760 --> 12:43.760
quote.

12:43.760 --> 12:44.760
Yeah.

12:44.760 --> 12:45.760
I don't know.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.300
We just see the laying out of the narrative here.

12:47.300 --> 12:51.300
And that is basically that, okay, you, so you had antifa, they started things off these

12:51.300 --> 12:56.960
provocateurs and they were working with some other shade, a shadowy group, uh, was the,

12:56.960 --> 13:00.160
the big, tough guys that the skinny Jean folks had hired.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.280
Um, sure.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.600
It's all just provocateur stuff to make us look bad, man.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.520
So what's going to happen at the next one?

13:05.520 --> 13:09.000
Well, Alex is warning that, uh, there's going to be a lot more.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.640
He's basically at this point been like, all right, they set us up.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.280
It was all fake, but also I'm fucking out.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.480
Oh yeah.

13:15.480 --> 13:19.320
He was planning on going to the inauguration and now he's like, hell no.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.320
Well that's smart.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.320
That's smart.

13:21.320 --> 13:22.320
Yeah.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.320
That is very smart.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.320
Yeah.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.320
He's, he's changed his tone quite a bit.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.320
It's a, it's all like, oh no, no, no.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.320
Isn't that, isn't that a surprise?

13:27.320 --> 13:29.320
They're all going to be setups in the future.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.320
So wild.

13:30.320 --> 13:35.120
So wild how he would completely change his tone the moment he got exactly what he wanted

13:35.120 --> 13:38.120
and now realizes it's time to, uh, time to pivot.

13:38.120 --> 13:39.120
Yeah.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.120
Time to pivot.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.120
Hmm.

13:41.120 --> 13:45.640
Uh, but you know, Hey, there's a lot of other folks who are, uh, are coming out here and

13:45.640 --> 13:53.560
uh, you know, they're, uh, making some, uh, some insightful inciting claims and statements.

13:53.560 --> 13:54.560
All right.

13:54.560 --> 13:59.520
So you have all these leftists, all these members of Congress, and I've got their quotes

13:59.520 --> 14:00.520
right here.

14:00.520 --> 14:02.320
We'll play some of the clips at the moment.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.500
Ted Lou threatened widespread civil unrest.

14:05.500 --> 14:08.200
We need to see some fires.

14:08.200 --> 14:13.520
So Alex is referring to a 32nd clip of Ted Lou from, uh, 2018 where he's being interviewed

14:13.520 --> 14:19.400
by Chris Hayes on MSNBC and is discussing the potential firing of Robert Mueller.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.400
Not fires.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.400
Fuck you.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.400
Fuck you.

14:22.400 --> 14:27.960
He doesn't call for fires and he doesn't actually call for anything.

14:27.960 --> 14:31.880
He just says that if Trump fires Mueller, it would likely lead to civil unrest and protest.

14:31.880 --> 14:32.880
Great.

14:32.880 --> 14:33.880
That's not a threat.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.920
But that's how the comment and stuff like this is reported on Infowars.

14:36.920 --> 14:37.920
No, no, no.

14:37.920 --> 14:42.300
If somebody says this is the logical result of what this person does, they're like, see,

14:42.300 --> 14:43.800
Mueller telling them to do it.

14:43.800 --> 14:44.800
Yeah.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.800
And you're like, God damn it, guys.

14:45.800 --> 14:46.800
You're stupid.

14:46.800 --> 14:47.800
Yeah.

14:47.800 --> 14:52.080
So also Alex has found an Antifa leader, uh, that, uh, he's going to, uh, pinpoint as the,

14:52.080 --> 14:55.160
uh, the, the villain of January 6th.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.680
And I have an Antifa leader that was one of the first to break in who said, we're going

14:58.680 --> 15:03.320
to go there and pose as patriots as Trump supporters.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.120
And we're going to burn the Capitol down.

15:05.120 --> 15:08.680
He said it in Utah, where he lives, where he's been arrested and charged for inciting

15:08.680 --> 15:11.800
riot before.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.280
We'll show you who he is.

15:13.280 --> 15:19.520
He said it in DC the day before the event in a speech to Antifa, who was then getting

15:19.520 --> 15:31.560
into manga outfits in the Capitol, he was arrested, but then they dropped the charges

15:31.560 --> 15:34.280
on him because he did a good job.

15:34.280 --> 15:38.420
This supposed Antifa leader Alex is talking about is a guy named John Sullivan.

15:38.420 --> 15:39.420
He's not an Antifa leader.

15:39.420 --> 15:43.360
I don't know what that means, but he's, uh, he is somebody who's had some history and

15:43.360 --> 15:46.900
involvement in anti-fascist and social justice activism.

15:46.900 --> 15:50.360
Sullivan was one of the people who was there and was recording the storming of the Capitol,

15:50.360 --> 15:55.400
supposedly as an independent journalist, documenting history, PolitiFact reviewed his footage.

15:55.400 --> 15:59.900
And there are some questions about how disconnected from the story he managed to be with him occasionally

15:59.900 --> 16:03.480
seeming to express encouragement about what was going on around him.

16:03.480 --> 16:07.560
But that's a far cry from the accusations that people like Alex are making as an independent

16:07.560 --> 16:10.920
journalist who agrees with all of what you guys are doing.

16:10.920 --> 16:14.500
I would like you to continue storming the Capitol building.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.920
And somehow I'm the bad guy here.

16:16.920 --> 16:17.920
What are you talking about?

16:17.920 --> 16:21.800
The way it looks is that Sullivan is a bit of a bad player in the game.

16:21.800 --> 16:26.600
He probably felt like he was doing an impartial piece of journalism documenting a monumental

16:26.600 --> 16:31.200
moment, but he didn't show the poise and discipline to actually pull that role off.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.840
That's what it appears like to me.

16:32.840 --> 16:36.520
He said that some of his encouraging words were meant to help him blend in and that very

16:36.520 --> 16:39.400
well may be the case, and I think that's what Alex is talking about with him, like we're

16:39.400 --> 16:44.360
going to pretend to be MAGA people, like you do want to blend in with the crowd.

16:44.360 --> 16:47.440
Yeah, I mean they will tear you limb from limb.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.040
They did have that kind of Scrum vibe to them.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.040
Scrum.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.040
Yeah.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.860
Whatever the case, it's nonsense to take whatever dubious behavior Sullivan may have shown on

16:55.860 --> 16:59.520
January 6th and take it as proof that he was somehow an Antifa leader who was responsible

16:59.520 --> 17:01.340
for the storming of the Capitol.

17:01.340 --> 17:03.640
That is what I would call a desperate attempt to scapegoat.

17:03.640 --> 17:04.680
Yeah, that's not good.

17:04.680 --> 17:08.580
I can't find confirmation that he's been arrested in relation to the Capitol storming, but he

17:08.580 --> 17:13.840
is facing charges related to an earlier protest in Utah that is still going through the courts.

17:13.840 --> 17:17.680
So as far as I can tell, Alex is just making up the part about him having charges and them

17:17.680 --> 17:23.000
being dropped related to this, and he's doing that because of things like what Joel Skousen

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
said on our last episode, that is if the provocateurs themselves get arrested, they'll be let off

17:29.000 --> 17:32.040
because they're in on it with the authorities.

17:32.040 --> 17:36.720
And that's just sort of building up that narrative, but I can't find any evidence of that.

17:36.720 --> 17:42.240
I still don't understand how they're getting around the fact that, regardless, fuck it,

17:42.240 --> 17:44.980
say Antifa did the whole thing.

17:44.980 --> 17:50.400
You guys do still realize that they only followed because it's what they want to do and what

17:50.400 --> 17:51.920
you told them to do.

17:51.920 --> 17:56.280
Well, there's a couple of thoughts on this, actually, that come up over the course of

17:56.280 --> 17:57.280
this.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.280
Okay.

17:58.280 --> 18:03.560
I think hypnotism may be involved.

18:03.560 --> 18:06.960
You know, I should have seen that one coming.

18:06.960 --> 18:07.960
Mass hypnosis.

18:07.960 --> 18:08.960
That's what it was.

18:08.960 --> 18:09.960
Yep.

18:09.960 --> 18:10.960
Shit.

18:10.960 --> 18:11.960
So it turns out...

18:11.960 --> 18:15.640
You just red-pilled me is what it turns out.

18:15.640 --> 18:21.220
Alex has, I was trying to figure out a way to talk about, like, come up with a pill,

18:21.220 --> 18:24.640
but it's just a jelly bean.

18:24.640 --> 18:25.640
Never mind.

18:25.640 --> 18:26.640
Okay.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.800
I'm kind of understanding here that he's, like, proven everything.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.800
Like, everything is...

18:30.800 --> 18:31.800
We got this, man.

18:31.800 --> 18:32.800
Sure.

18:32.800 --> 18:33.800
Sure.

18:33.800 --> 18:34.800
It was Antifa.

18:34.800 --> 18:35.800
Easy.

18:35.800 --> 18:36.800
And an unnamed fake militia.

18:36.800 --> 18:37.800
Done and done.

18:37.800 --> 18:38.800
That was going around.

18:38.800 --> 18:39.800
They're working with the feds.

18:39.800 --> 18:43.240
We just finished, right before the show went live today, a very powerful special report

18:43.240 --> 18:48.600
that details the false flag, how Antifa staged it with some other shadowy paramilitary groups

18:48.600 --> 18:49.600
that we're starting to identify.

18:49.600 --> 18:55.600
That'll be in a report tomorrow, because they got to have a right-wing chair group as well.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.640
So when it comes out, they can blame both groups.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.720
This is about coming out for everybody's liberties.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.240
So this is how it goes.

19:02.240 --> 19:08.720
This is the way that you explain the fact that there were groups that look almost exactly

19:08.720 --> 19:10.720
like your buddies.

19:10.720 --> 19:11.720
Yeah.

19:11.720 --> 19:12.720
Yep.

19:12.720 --> 19:13.720
Yeah.

19:13.720 --> 19:18.580
I mean, you might as well just come out and say, if we'd won, I'm happy that the Patriots

19:18.580 --> 19:22.440
won, and since we lost, it was all Antifa.

19:22.440 --> 19:23.440
Just say that.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.440
Since the bottom fell out.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.440
Yeah.

19:25.440 --> 19:26.440
That is not us.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.560
Now that it turns out everybody doesn't like this, it wasn't us.

19:29.560 --> 19:30.560
Guess what?

19:30.560 --> 19:31.840
We get it both ways.

19:31.840 --> 19:34.040
Coming, going, forward, backward.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.040
We get it.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.040
Yeah.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.040
It's fine.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.040
We're white.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.880
So the narrative here is being set, and it's fairly well said, I think, by Alex at this

19:40.880 --> 19:46.240
point that it was just these other people.

19:46.240 --> 19:47.240
It's not...

19:47.240 --> 19:49.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.440
Not me.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.440
Not Trump.

19:51.440 --> 19:56.480
Who could pull some sort of visual and audio evidence of me doing exactly the thing that

19:56.480 --> 19:57.800
I'm saying that I never did.

19:57.800 --> 20:02.960
It's all the deep state, and the deep state has a bunch of tendrils, and some of them

20:02.960 --> 20:05.080
are Antifa.

20:05.080 --> 20:07.000
Q is also deep state.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
How about Harrison Smith?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Is he deep state?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.960
No, but he wasn't actually even on air.

20:10.960 --> 20:11.960
That was a deep fake.

20:11.960 --> 20:12.960
Oh.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.840
That was a big deep fake.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.040
Whoever made that was good.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.960
They must have been working on that one for a long time.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.520
And he just pretends that...

20:21.520 --> 20:24.280
I haven't heard Alex talk about that broadcast at all.

20:24.280 --> 20:25.280
Oh, that's unsurprising.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.280
Yeah.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.280
Yeah.

20:27.280 --> 20:33.480
But look, so you have those deep state actors in the form of Q, Antifa.

20:33.480 --> 20:36.560
But there was another group there, and that was the Trump folks.

20:36.560 --> 20:39.360
And you might be surprised to find out what they were up to.

20:39.360 --> 20:40.360
Okay.

20:40.360 --> 20:45.800
This was meant to bring in the 25th Amendment, the impeachment of Trump, but it failed because

20:45.800 --> 20:52.240
unlike any other football fans, or basketball fans, or liberals, or whoever, even though

20:52.240 --> 20:56.200
they had hundreds of paid provocateurs trying to riot, trying to lead this, instead of the

20:56.200 --> 20:59.880
Trump supporters, now we have dozens of these videos, were kicking their ass when they attacked

20:59.880 --> 21:01.940
the cops and tried to break in the windows.

21:01.940 --> 21:04.340
But they got overwhelmed.

21:04.340 --> 21:11.000
So now the narrative is becoming that Trump's people tried to fight off Antifa and Q folks

21:11.000 --> 21:12.520
who were trying to storm the counter.

21:12.520 --> 21:13.520
All right.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.520
All right.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.600
This is bullshit, get the fuck out of my face forever.

21:16.600 --> 21:20.320
I'm done speaking to anybody who's like, no, no, no, that's what happened.

21:20.320 --> 21:26.120
Not only did Trump supporters not try and take over the whole fucking country, but they

21:26.120 --> 21:29.940
actually tried to stop the takeover of the whole country.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.960
If you say that to me, I will never speak to you again.

21:32.960 --> 21:37.980
Love the constitution in America so much that they were willing to stand up and fight against

21:37.980 --> 21:45.620
these malevolent communist invading forces like Q and Han people and Antifa in order

21:45.620 --> 21:49.280
to protect the Capitol building that they respect so much.

21:49.280 --> 21:50.360
Say it to my face.

21:50.360 --> 21:51.360
Say it to my face.

21:51.360 --> 21:54.440
I've talked to real army intelligence, highest levels, I'm not going to say the names of

21:54.440 --> 21:57.880
the groups, everybody knows the highest level the army is, army special operations, Delta

21:57.880 --> 21:58.880
Force, all that.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.280
I mean, we had live feeds of that when we were there.

22:01.280 --> 22:04.320
They're not like magic people, they're just like us, but they concur.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.080
This was a failed false flag, pipe bombs found outside.

22:07.080 --> 22:12.840
It was meant to be hundreds dead, hostages taken, Q-tards believing it all, Q-tards can

22:12.840 --> 22:18.160
say they were going to go take hostages online, but they didn't because the simulation broke

22:18.160 --> 22:21.920
down once they actually got there in the real world, it didn't happen.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.680
A lot of it because patriots fought them off and stopped them.

22:24.680 --> 22:29.440
So an alliance of Q-tards with Antifa and some shadowy synthetic militia group, the

22:29.440 --> 22:31.240
feds control is what we now know.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.840
So that's, hey, look, that's quite a showdown.

22:33.840 --> 22:34.840
Yeah.

22:34.840 --> 22:35.840
Quite a showdown.

22:35.840 --> 22:36.840
Yeah.

22:36.840 --> 22:37.840
Oh boy.

22:37.840 --> 22:38.840
Yeah.

22:38.840 --> 22:39.840
People still doing the tards.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.840
Yeah, I don't like that at all.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.360
I don't like that at all.

22:43.360 --> 22:47.280
No, and it's kind of interesting that Alex seems to have given himself the green light

22:47.280 --> 22:51.440
to say that a lot about Q-folks.

22:51.440 --> 22:56.600
And I think that there's a real sense that he's realized this is not profitable for me

22:56.600 --> 22:58.920
at all anymore.

22:58.920 --> 23:05.000
Great way to throw them under the bus and I can maybe get some of the people back and

23:05.000 --> 23:08.740
at the same time, you know what it feels like to me?

23:08.740 --> 23:16.440
It feels like the relationship between Alex and Glenn Beck in like 2009, but in reverse.

23:16.440 --> 23:17.440
Yeah, yeah.

23:17.440 --> 23:18.440
Now Alex is...

23:18.440 --> 23:19.440
I'm not Q.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.440
At least I'm not Q.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.440
Yeah, yeah.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.440
You can hire me for Fox News.

23:22.440 --> 23:24.440
I'm better than some of your fucking hosts.

23:24.440 --> 23:25.880
Yeah, exactly.

23:25.880 --> 23:29.880
Glenn Beck got a lot of mileage and legitimacy out of being like, I'm not Alex Jones.

23:29.880 --> 23:30.880
At least I'm not him.

23:30.880 --> 23:31.880
Yeah.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.160
And now Alex has Q to point to.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.320
He's finally freed himself up to do that.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.440
That's disgusting.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.680
And I think that it actually works on some people.

23:38.680 --> 23:42.340
You saw flying around on Twitter all these people being like, I can't believe Alex Jones

23:42.340 --> 23:43.340
denounced Q.

23:43.340 --> 23:44.340
Oh, totally.

23:44.340 --> 23:48.960
Because it's an effective thing to have some other thing that's farther and more extreme

23:48.960 --> 23:52.720
than you that you can point to and be like, you know you hate that more.

23:52.720 --> 23:53.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:53.720 --> 23:54.720
Get some heat off you.

23:54.720 --> 23:57.880
Everybody's acting like the tide just came in and everybody's moving up a level and it's

23:57.880 --> 24:00.880
unacceptable and I won't fucking allow it.

24:00.880 --> 24:01.880
No.

24:01.880 --> 24:02.880
No.

24:02.880 --> 24:03.880
No.

24:03.880 --> 24:08.840
So, after this storming of the Capitol, you know, a lot of people have had some soul searching.

24:08.840 --> 24:12.320
They've had some people asking difficult questions.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.320
Sure.

24:13.320 --> 24:17.040
And, you know, a lot of conversation has gone around about like what it would actually even

24:17.040 --> 24:21.200
mean and what it would take to be together as a country again.

24:21.200 --> 24:27.560
Like unite and Alex is afraid about truth and reconciliation committees.

24:27.560 --> 24:31.580
Yeah, I would say we're probably gonna have to do something along the lines of the end

24:31.580 --> 24:37.600
of World War II combined with de-bathification or, yeah, something like a better version

24:37.600 --> 24:40.040
of that for all the white supremacists in our goddamn...

24:40.040 --> 24:44.940
I don't know if you've heard, but John Brennan has called for truth and reconciliation committees.

24:44.940 --> 24:46.380
Has he?

24:46.380 --> 24:51.040
He would get fucked up if there were real truth and reconciliation committees.

24:51.040 --> 24:55.860
If there were 100% real ones, we would be fucking decapitating Brennan.

24:55.860 --> 24:57.400
So I doubt he's calling for that shit.

24:57.400 --> 25:01.400
There would be some truth and some reconciliation coming of both directions.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.400
Brutal.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.400
Brutal shit to him.

25:03.400 --> 25:07.520
By the way, Brennan has now said if you were a talk show host, a member of Congress, you

25:07.520 --> 25:12.240
must come to communist reconciliation things on TV and say you're bad.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.820
But once you do that, then things really collapse.

25:14.820 --> 25:16.020
People cannot do this.

25:16.020 --> 25:18.600
They're following a tried and true communist takeover.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.960
I think that Alex is misreading a headline here.

25:20.960 --> 25:21.960
Oh, yeah?

25:21.960 --> 25:24.120
So John Brennan didn't say that there needed to be reconciliation.

25:24.120 --> 25:25.120
Unsurprising.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.480
But I think I found the quote he's talking about.

25:27.480 --> 25:28.480
Okay.

25:28.480 --> 25:32.160
I'll tell you that there can only be reconciliation with repentance.

25:32.160 --> 25:35.740
And I think the single most important thing that Republicans in Congress who helped facilitate

25:35.740 --> 25:39.640
this widespread conspiracy theory that somehow the election was stolen and the most important

25:39.640 --> 25:44.440
thing that Donald Trump can do in those remaining 10 days is to stop those lies and to persuade

25:44.440 --> 25:48.360
their followers and supporters that the president elect Biden is the duly elected president

25:48.360 --> 25:49.360
of the United States.

25:49.360 --> 25:50.360
Great.

25:50.360 --> 25:54.520
That was said by Senator Chris Coons on Sunday's edition of Face the Nation.

25:54.520 --> 25:59.320
I think that Alex just skimmed a headline that mentioned reconciliation and the host

25:59.320 --> 26:02.520
of Face the Nation, whose name is Margaret Brennan.

26:02.520 --> 26:06.600
I would bet that Alex saw the name Brennan and decided that it was John Brennan calling

26:06.600 --> 26:09.280
for communist style reconciliation committees.

26:09.280 --> 26:14.640
Dan, Dan, it is infuriating to me that that happened.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.680
And two, that you're good enough to figure out exactly what happened.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.560
I think that's a frustrating truth.

26:19.560 --> 26:20.880
I think that's what happened.

26:20.880 --> 26:21.880
It's totally what happened.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.240
It seems on brand for him.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.240
100% what happened.

26:25.240 --> 26:29.420
To see the name Brennan and just assume instead of the host of Face the Nation.

26:29.420 --> 26:32.880
You are inside his mind to a terrifying degree.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.760
You're fucking Hannibal Lecter, Dan.

26:34.760 --> 26:39.240
You're Hannibal Lecter, and he's the guy from Red Dragon or whatever.

26:39.240 --> 26:40.240
Um, maybe.

26:40.240 --> 26:41.240
Yeah.

26:41.240 --> 26:46.280
I don't like to cook though, or at least I'm not good at it.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.880
Hannibal but for frozen pizzas.

26:47.880 --> 26:51.520
To be fair, I have no evidence that Hannibal is good at cooking.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.520
That's fair.

26:52.520 --> 26:53.520
Yeah.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.800
And there's no like reviews of his cooking.

26:55.800 --> 27:01.520
Well, I mean, you have to have some sort of talent to cook a brain and eat it to the person.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.200
Yeah, I guess so.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.160
And pair it with wine.

27:05.160 --> 27:08.400
So, Barnes comes in.

27:08.400 --> 27:13.520
Barnes drops by, and his entire appearance here on this Sunday episode, this January

27:13.520 --> 27:19.080
10th episode, is that, hey, Q sucks.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.160
Just there to beat up on Q.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.160
Great.

27:21.160 --> 27:26.120
Um, and so he describes it as a psy-op, which I have some questions about.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.120
Okay.

27:27.120 --> 27:31.320
This is the most dangerous time in the history of our constitutional republic.

27:31.320 --> 27:34.880
It faces more risk than it did, frankly, in 1860.

27:34.880 --> 27:40.920
That's the kind of threat that they want to impose by ramrodding, using the pretext of

27:40.920 --> 27:49.160
this staged event that was heavily facilitated by a psy-op operation of QAnon and with infiltrators

27:49.160 --> 27:51.440
and instigators involved as well.

27:51.440 --> 27:56.360
So the thing that I run into, and I hear this, they're like QAnon is a psy-op.

27:56.360 --> 28:01.800
One of the things that really fueled it lately, and in the last year at least, has been Donald

28:01.800 --> 28:08.540
Trump retweeting QAnon accounts, and Donald Trump himself giving tacit acknowledgement

28:08.540 --> 28:13.920
of and support of this because it, you know, narcissistically feeds his ego or whatever.

28:13.920 --> 28:19.000
So I have to ask if Trump is running a psy-op on himself.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.400
Is Trump running a psy-op on you, Robert Barnes?

28:21.400 --> 28:25.120
I think what's obvious is that Trump is Antifa, Dan.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.120
Oh, shit.

28:26.120 --> 28:31.640
And that's why Antifa, that's who really fucking Antifa-ed us at the Capitol building.

28:31.640 --> 28:32.640
Right.

28:32.640 --> 28:40.360
Who, if Antifa inspired the attack, the only answer, Dan, is Trump is a black bloc.

28:40.360 --> 28:41.360
Sure.

28:41.360 --> 28:45.760
So you had those people there who were looking real mighty scary.

28:45.760 --> 28:51.760
You know, at the Capitol, you had the looky-loo types, the people who were maybe just there

28:51.760 --> 28:53.520
to take pictures of themselves.

28:53.520 --> 28:54.520
Right.

28:54.520 --> 28:55.520
Foot fetishists of AOC.

28:55.520 --> 28:56.520
Sure.

28:56.520 --> 28:57.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:57.520 --> 28:58.520
And then you had terrifying people.

28:58.520 --> 28:59.520
Right.

28:59.520 --> 29:00.520
And the terrifying...

29:00.520 --> 29:01.520
Like the foot fetishists of AOC?

29:01.520 --> 29:02.520
Okay.

29:02.520 --> 29:03.920
Well, they're terrifying in a different way.

29:03.920 --> 29:04.920
Yeah.

29:04.920 --> 29:09.080
You had the real militia-trained looking type people.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.080
Right, right, right.

29:10.080 --> 29:15.220
And so in order to explain this, Alex has already said that this is some militia that's

29:15.220 --> 29:21.680
working with the feds, but now we get to pivot that over and like, that's what the Q people

29:21.680 --> 29:22.680
were.

29:22.680 --> 29:23.680
Yeah.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.680
Right?

29:24.680 --> 29:25.680
Sure.

29:25.680 --> 29:26.680
So that explains everything.

29:26.680 --> 29:27.680
God, I hate this.

29:27.680 --> 29:28.680
Because there were people there with zip ties.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.380
They arrested one of them in Nashville.

29:30.380 --> 29:34.000
So there are people there that had ulterior agendas that misled other people who were

29:34.000 --> 29:36.520
partaking, who didn't realize what was happening.

29:36.520 --> 29:40.560
Well, they told them, we're Q secret agents under Trump's orders and we're going to go

29:40.560 --> 29:41.560
in there.

29:41.560 --> 29:44.940
And then now I heard that day one, oh, they told them they were about to get Pelosi and

29:44.940 --> 29:45.940
grab the proof.

29:45.940 --> 29:50.720
And then sure enough, oh, there's experts, oh, this was done for special ops to get Pelosi's

29:50.720 --> 29:51.720
laptop.

29:51.720 --> 29:53.620
I mean, this is so scripted, folks.

29:53.620 --> 29:57.840
If you're online, you pledge allegiance to some made up letter of the alphabet, and then

29:57.840 --> 30:01.720
it tells you to go take over the White House or the Capitol or whatever, you're being set

30:01.720 --> 30:04.360
up for death, just like Arlington Road.

30:04.360 --> 30:06.920
Go see Arlington Road.

30:06.920 --> 30:11.040
If you're talking about the people that pledge allegiance to Q being stupid, I would ask

30:11.040 --> 30:13.800
you what about General Flynn and his family?

30:13.800 --> 30:14.800
Sure.

30:14.800 --> 30:18.460
They posted a video of themselves pledging allegiance to Q and saying, where we go one

30:18.460 --> 30:19.460
we go all.

30:19.460 --> 30:24.300
Nah, nah, they were manipulating the deep state into thinking that the deep state had

30:24.300 --> 30:28.660
manipulated them into believing what the deep state says.

30:28.660 --> 30:34.840
And that way they can run this counter, counter, counter, counter coup, which is going on right

30:34.840 --> 30:39.320
now, after the first coup from...

30:39.320 --> 30:42.520
I'm so tired, Dan, I'm just so goddamn tired.

30:42.520 --> 30:46.080
They also posted that video of themselves pledging allegiance to Q on the Fourth of

30:46.080 --> 30:47.080
July.

30:47.080 --> 30:50.800
Explain to me what exactly you think is the difference between pledging allegiance to

30:50.800 --> 30:53.680
Q and pledging allegiance to Trump.

30:53.680 --> 30:54.680
Not much.

30:54.680 --> 30:55.680
No.

30:55.680 --> 30:56.680
Not much.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.240
I don't see too much difference between that and pledging allegiance to a fucking flag.

30:59.240 --> 31:02.360
What are we doing pledging allegiance to shit, Dan?

31:02.360 --> 31:06.720
Let's not dissect that now, but I agree, patriotism can go astray.

31:06.720 --> 31:12.920
So Robert Barnes apparently works for Trump, apparently.

31:12.920 --> 31:13.920
Sure why not?

31:13.920 --> 31:14.920
I don't know if that's true.

31:14.920 --> 31:17.280
No other lawyer will work for him anymore.

31:17.280 --> 31:21.120
I don't know if that's true and I don't care, because there are ethical problems whether

31:21.120 --> 31:27.440
it's true or not, like, it's still like, he still should be disbarred for his behavior.

31:27.440 --> 31:28.440
Oh yeah.

31:28.440 --> 31:29.440
Oh yeah.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.440
But he...

31:30.440 --> 31:31.800
Is Larry Klaiman free for this one?

31:31.800 --> 31:32.800
He might be.

31:32.800 --> 31:33.800
He might be.

31:33.800 --> 31:34.800
He might not be able to practice.

31:34.800 --> 31:35.800
I hope not.

31:35.800 --> 31:36.800
I hope not.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.320
But Barnes, I just love this.

31:39.320 --> 31:42.440
We heard this before and I just wanted to play it because it happened again.

31:42.440 --> 31:45.120
Alex being like, he works for Trump, he doesn't want me to tell you that.

31:45.120 --> 31:49.920
All right, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to lay out my curriculum vitae or my

31:49.920 --> 31:52.680
27 years of the fight, but I am true to America.

31:52.680 --> 31:57.360
I make mistakes, but I believe in human justice and freedom and promote it.

31:57.360 --> 32:01.840
Robert Barnes does not even want it known that he's worked for Trump for months during

32:01.840 --> 32:05.920
this election fraud, battling at the highest levels or that talks to Trump on a routine

32:05.920 --> 32:06.920
basis.

32:06.920 --> 32:09.800
But we're going to put that out now because we're 10 days out from the inauguration of

32:09.800 --> 32:10.800
Biden.

32:10.800 --> 32:11.800
So...

32:11.800 --> 32:12.800
You're not putting that out now.

32:12.800 --> 32:13.800
You've put that out a bunch already.

32:13.800 --> 32:14.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:14.800 --> 32:15.800
A whole bunch.

32:15.800 --> 32:16.800
A whole bunch.

32:16.800 --> 32:17.800
You're not good at keeping secrets.

32:17.800 --> 32:18.800
No.

32:18.800 --> 32:19.800
Especially when they're made up bullshit.

32:19.800 --> 32:20.800
Right.

32:20.800 --> 32:21.800
Or when they're true.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.560
True and ethically very not good.

32:24.560 --> 32:29.960
I don't know too many lawyers who would be like, okay, my client is the president of

32:29.960 --> 32:30.960
the United States.

32:30.960 --> 32:31.960
Right.

32:31.960 --> 32:36.120
I think it's a good idea for me to have a radio show with Alex Jones.

32:36.120 --> 32:39.880
Yeah, it's a good idea for me to moonlight as a pro-Trump propagandist.

32:39.880 --> 32:44.920
I don't think that is good for the legal profession.

32:44.920 --> 32:45.920
It's iffy.

32:45.920 --> 32:46.920
Yeah.

32:46.920 --> 32:53.560
So Barnes, I will say, you know, just looking at everything purely, you know, take morals,

32:53.560 --> 32:55.880
take just everything out of it.

32:55.880 --> 32:56.880
Sure.

32:56.880 --> 33:00.640
He has some accurate points that he makes about QAnon, which, oh, shocking.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.440
A lot of people have been saying for a while.

33:02.440 --> 33:03.440
Yeah.

33:03.440 --> 33:07.120
The first thing that he says is not really one of those.

33:07.120 --> 33:13.300
He talks about how this is a brilliant psy-op, which I take issue with some of that.

33:13.300 --> 33:16.880
But he has some other points that I think are pretty good.

33:16.880 --> 33:20.420
Q is a brilliant disinformation campaign that is unique.

33:20.420 --> 33:25.260
If you look at other message boards and anon posters that claim to be government agents

33:25.260 --> 33:29.360
on those message boards, they do not communicate in the way Q did.

33:29.360 --> 33:34.360
So people who study disinformation campaigns very early on were telling me this was not

33:34.360 --> 33:39.600
just a sort of conspiracy theorist of people going down a rabbit hole on a random message

33:39.600 --> 33:40.600
board.

33:40.600 --> 33:45.580
This was showing signs of a sophisticated disinformation psy-ops campaign being run

33:45.580 --> 33:48.960
by somebody with institutional influence and backing.

33:48.960 --> 33:54.880
I do think that there is a point to be made about how different this is than other things

33:54.880 --> 33:55.880
like this.

33:55.880 --> 33:56.880
Sure.

33:56.880 --> 34:00.280
The message gate got to a certain point and then it fizzled out.

34:00.280 --> 34:03.960
Now granted, it sort of metastasized and evolved into what this is.

34:03.960 --> 34:04.960
Sure.

34:04.960 --> 34:10.160
But there were a bunch of other attempts at doing something like this on message boards.

34:10.160 --> 34:11.160
Right.

34:11.160 --> 34:12.160
Right, right, right.

34:12.160 --> 34:15.880
And it even goes back to earlier conspiracy times when you'd have people who would have

34:15.880 --> 34:22.720
these, essentially, huge role-playing things where they would have like...

34:22.720 --> 34:28.540
No, this is like an augmented reality participatory storytelling thing that a bunch of people

34:28.540 --> 34:29.540
are...

34:29.540 --> 34:32.740
You know, it reminds me of Gravity Falls, weirdly enough.

34:32.740 --> 34:40.560
At the end of the cartoon, they had a little statue that was somewhere in the Pacific Northwest.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.280
That's where the show was set.

34:42.280 --> 34:47.400
And then a bunch of fans put together all of these clues together and wound up finding

34:47.400 --> 34:51.160
out that it was actually something that they had hidden in real life, like this little

34:51.160 --> 34:52.720
statue there, and they found it.

34:52.720 --> 34:56.920
And it was a bunch of people all working together, finding out all of these clues to...

34:56.920 --> 35:01.440
And it's functionally the same thing as Q, it's just this time there's nothing at the

35:01.440 --> 35:04.800
end of the rainbow but storming the fucking Capitol building.

35:04.800 --> 35:09.440
Yeah, there are some things like that that are outside of the realms of political conspiracy

35:09.440 --> 35:10.440
and propaganda.

35:10.440 --> 35:11.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:11.440 --> 35:15.640
And then there are also versions that are conspiracy and internet message board based

35:15.640 --> 35:20.360
things that could have turned into stuff like this and made it into an augmented reality

35:20.360 --> 35:21.360
kind of thing.

35:21.360 --> 35:22.360
Totally, totally.

35:22.360 --> 35:23.360
But it didn't.

35:23.360 --> 35:25.200
I do think that that's fair.

35:25.200 --> 35:29.480
I don't think it makes sense to say that it's brilliant and institutionally supported.

35:29.480 --> 35:34.760
No, I would even argue that the main reason that it works is because it's kind of stupid.

35:34.760 --> 35:38.160
It's at the level of the people participating in it.

35:38.160 --> 35:42.760
Yeah, and it's malleable and decentralized to an extent that you can just... anything

35:42.760 --> 35:43.760
can be anything.

35:43.760 --> 35:48.600
Yeah, which is why you don't want anybody with institutional control anywhere near it.

35:48.600 --> 35:49.600
Yeah.

35:49.600 --> 35:50.600
You know what I said?

35:50.600 --> 35:55.600
I think when I said that he had a good point, I think I was basically just remembering this

35:55.600 --> 35:56.600
next clip.

35:56.600 --> 35:57.600
Yeah.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.920
And that's him talking about the element of it being like a game.

35:59.920 --> 36:00.920
Yeah.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.680
And a lot of people have talked about that, about how one of the things that makes it

36:03.680 --> 36:10.680
so insidious is the way in which there's like, you're involved in this, in the way that that

36:10.680 --> 36:14.840
Gravity Falls thing is actually a fun, immersive experience.

36:14.840 --> 36:20.220
This is a false carrot in front of you on a pole.

36:20.220 --> 36:24.280
Some people catch Pokemon on the corner and some people find out that there's a secret

36:24.280 --> 36:25.760
conspiracy on the corner.

36:25.760 --> 36:27.160
It's the same fucking shit.

36:27.160 --> 36:31.120
And Barnes is now talking about that, but it's something that other people have been

36:31.120 --> 36:32.920
talking about and warning about for a long time.

36:32.920 --> 36:34.800
Since the beginning of the fucking thing.

36:34.800 --> 36:42.080
And these people, like Alex and like Infowars, were perfectly happy to, I guess, ignore any

36:42.080 --> 36:45.840
of these warnings to the extent that this was possibly profitable.

36:45.840 --> 36:48.120
Let's see if we can exploit some of it.

36:48.120 --> 36:50.080
It's all just supporting Trump.

36:50.080 --> 36:53.020
So like, Hey, let's let it be.

36:53.020 --> 36:56.760
But now somebody's got to go onto the bus and it's going to be Q and A.

36:56.760 --> 36:57.760
Yeah.

36:57.760 --> 37:01.080
They would, let's say they were trying to find something in a scavenger hunt and that's

37:01.080 --> 37:02.080
what it was.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.080
It was part fiction, part reality.

37:03.080 --> 37:07.360
And they went to a real house where something was hidden or a clue was located for them

37:07.360 --> 37:08.640
to find the next clue.

37:08.640 --> 37:13.040
Well, they would go there and they would find, say three pieces of wood, all pointed at a

37:13.040 --> 37:14.680
particular part of the wall.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.360
And they'd be like, Oh, that can't be a coincidence.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.160
It must be something behind that wall.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.600
When in fact it was purely coincidental.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.600
They were seeing patterns that did not exist.

37:22.600 --> 37:28.200
Well, what QAnon brilliantly did was use the questioning technique without ever giving

37:28.200 --> 37:35.000
answers, use vagueness and ambiguity while appearing to give specific secrets to, because

37:35.000 --> 37:41.320
with Pokemon Go and others, you shift into the VR, VR is a fake template over reality.

37:41.320 --> 37:43.080
So, you know, reality's real.

37:43.080 --> 37:47.000
You're in a garage, you're in a gutter, you're on top of building.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.280
But then they found people, if they told them there was a bridge off a building, someone

37:51.280 --> 37:55.720
would just jump off the building because suddenly there was a bridge there in their overlay

37:55.720 --> 37:57.920
through the Pokemon Go.

37:57.920 --> 37:58.920
That's exactly right.

37:58.920 --> 38:04.840
I know that they think that there's a substantial difference between what they do and what their

38:04.840 --> 38:07.360
describing and I don't think that there is.

38:07.360 --> 38:08.360
There's none.

38:08.360 --> 38:11.360
I know that, you know, factually there's a difference between saying there's a bridge

38:11.360 --> 38:16.200
in front of you and then you jump and you fall, but Alex just tells people that headlines

38:16.200 --> 38:19.160
mean something and he has never read the article.

38:19.160 --> 38:23.000
It's the same, it's the same amount of faith that's being demanded of.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.480
He's sufficiently vague about his predictions.

38:25.480 --> 38:28.200
He gives you secrets that aren't really real.

38:28.200 --> 38:29.200
Yeah.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.160
Basically everything he's describing.

38:31.160 --> 38:32.160
Yeah.

38:32.160 --> 38:33.160
Yeah.

38:33.160 --> 38:38.160
You know, like I used to have bigger teeth, but now I just grind them every time we do

38:38.160 --> 38:39.160
this show.

38:39.160 --> 38:40.160
So now they're much smaller.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.160
You don't even have teeth anymore.

38:41.160 --> 38:42.160
I don't even have teeth.

38:42.160 --> 38:45.720
I just have ground down nubs.

38:45.720 --> 38:52.040
So it turns out Alex, a couple months back, had threatened to reveal who Q is because

38:52.040 --> 38:53.040
he knows all of it.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.040
Yes, of course.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.040
He never did do that.

38:55.040 --> 39:00.560
It was all just probably an attempt to get attention.

39:00.560 --> 39:01.560
Yeah.

39:01.560 --> 39:05.400
So this conversation becomes even sillier knowing that he's pretended that he knows

39:05.400 --> 39:07.800
who Q is and he can expose all of it.

39:07.800 --> 39:08.800
Right.

39:08.800 --> 39:15.000
Because apparently, I don't know if you know this, Q tried to enlist Robert Barnes.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
All right.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
I hate everyone.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.720
And they targeted people who they thought would otherwise be potential active sources

39:20.720 --> 39:23.960
of support for crowdsourcing Trump support.

39:23.960 --> 39:27.480
So they looked at people who did independent investigative journalism.

39:27.480 --> 39:28.480
Explain this.

39:28.480 --> 39:33.320
They actually approached you, and I don't know if you want to get into this, but not

39:33.320 --> 39:38.560
at the Q level, but above that, we're the intel group and we're with Q because again,

39:38.560 --> 39:42.520
they give you a virtual reality where you actually think you're fighting for freedom,

39:42.520 --> 39:44.520
but you're working for them.

39:44.520 --> 39:45.520
Exactly.

39:45.520 --> 39:46.520
Okay.

39:46.520 --> 39:57.200
So now Barnes, if you are agreeing with Alex when he says that Q tried to enlist you, it

39:57.200 --> 40:00.960
now is your all's responsibility to be like, who the fuck are you talking about?

40:00.960 --> 40:02.960
Who are you talking about?

40:02.960 --> 40:03.960
Provide us the name.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.160
You've already said you can throw them under the bus.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.160
Yeah, exactly.

40:07.160 --> 40:09.440
You could clear up a whole lot, Alex, if you wanted to.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.960
Oh, if you hate them so much.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.360
I fucking hate these people.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.000
Yeah, they're terrible.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.200
So Alex gets a little bit of breaking news in the middle of this broadcast, and it's

40:19.200 --> 40:21.200
not breaking news.

40:21.200 --> 40:26.760
That police officer, the Capitol Police, who died by suicide, Alex has decided to turn

40:26.760 --> 40:27.760
that into a conspiracy.

40:27.760 --> 40:28.760
Sure.

40:28.760 --> 40:29.760
All right.

40:29.760 --> 40:30.760
This is breaking news.

40:30.760 --> 40:32.680
I'm not ready to give all of it out yet.

40:32.680 --> 40:36.400
I'll do it next segment because I've got one more question from our sources, but we have

40:36.400 --> 40:39.240
this from inside the DC Police Department.

40:39.240 --> 40:42.720
There has been a high level suicide of one of the deputy police chiefs.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.200
I'll leave it at that.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.600
They're trying to cover it up.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.920
We don't know if it's actually a cover up.

40:46.920 --> 40:52.120
They may have killed them in the DC Capitol Police.

40:52.120 --> 40:59.880
So Alex is turning this police officer's death into a story where he is said to have committed

40:59.880 --> 41:05.680
suicide, but it might be a murder because he happens to be the cop who told these cops

41:05.680 --> 41:09.400
to stand down and allow Antifa to attack the Capitol.

41:09.400 --> 41:15.000
So he's basically cast this guy in this role, and it's just disgusting.

41:15.000 --> 41:21.520
I can't imagine being anywhere near someone who was affected by the Capitol building like

41:21.520 --> 41:28.360
that without like instantly being like, does anybody have a template for how to sue Alex

41:28.360 --> 41:29.360
Jones?

41:29.360 --> 41:30.360
Oh yeah.

41:30.360 --> 41:31.360
There should be at this point.

41:31.360 --> 41:35.840
I haven't heard him say anything yet, but does anybody have like a Mad Libs for the

41:35.840 --> 41:39.120
way Alex Jones is going to need to be sued for this?

41:39.120 --> 41:44.920
There should be like a whole section on legal zoom just dedicated to suing Alex for the

41:44.920 --> 41:45.920
right shit.

41:45.920 --> 41:46.920
Yeah.

41:46.920 --> 41:47.920
Yeah.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.760
There's a dropdown menu and they'll fill in the rest for you.

41:49.760 --> 41:50.760
Yeah.

41:50.760 --> 41:55.840
It's like, if I were this guy's family, I can't imagine what I would be like how pissed

41:55.840 --> 42:02.640
off I would be if you trying to imply that someone I cared about who I just lost just

42:02.640 --> 42:03.640
days ago.

42:03.640 --> 42:04.640
You fucking killed.

42:04.640 --> 42:05.640
Yeah.

42:05.640 --> 42:11.480
He, uh, it was, he, you know, it's all suspicious in a conspiracy because he ordered to stand

42:11.480 --> 42:12.480
down.

42:12.480 --> 42:13.480
Like go fuck yourself, man.

42:13.480 --> 42:14.480
No.

42:14.480 --> 42:15.480
How cruel.

42:15.480 --> 42:16.640
Keep his fucking name out of your mouth.

42:16.640 --> 42:18.960
I'm not even saying the dude's name out of respect.

42:18.960 --> 42:19.960
Absolutely not.

42:19.960 --> 42:25.200
So anyway, Barnes, uh, is still on and he thinks that, uh, that whole thing where everybody

42:25.200 --> 42:31.120
was like taking the pledge, like Flynn, uh, it was all a setup so they could get a conspiracy

42:31.120 --> 42:32.120
charge.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.300
So I was right about that.

42:33.300 --> 42:37.520
It's a double double kind of starting the late fall where the queue was asking people

42:37.520 --> 42:43.080
to take oaths to have the, have them broadcast videotape themselves, taking these oaths,

42:43.080 --> 42:46.200
have them broadcast other people that they were taking these oaths.

42:46.200 --> 42:51.880
Uh, and that was beginning to set up a, basically a future, uh, seditious conspiracy allegation

42:51.880 --> 42:57.000
against all participants and then try to motivate other ones to become more and more violent

42:57.000 --> 43:01.520
because the goal was to feel like this election was everything and whatever happened that

43:01.520 --> 43:03.180
this was the end of the world.

43:03.180 --> 43:04.680
So they had to take whatever.

43:04.680 --> 43:09.720
So they would either feel futility and frustration and fear and lash out or they would convince

43:09.720 --> 43:14.240
a portion of them that the, the insiders on the government and the insiders in the military

43:14.240 --> 43:18.200
and the insiders and the intelligence branches really wanted them to take action.

43:18.200 --> 43:20.680
How's that any different than Infowars coverage?

43:20.680 --> 43:26.840
Dan, I keep repeating in my head, violence is not the answer because the moment he said

43:26.840 --> 43:32.160
they wanted to make you feel like this election was the end of the world, the only response

43:32.160 --> 43:37.960
that I can, like I went red, like there is, there is flashing lights behind my eyes.

43:37.960 --> 43:47.400
No, I, I, you told me these people are run by the fucking devil and that if Trump loses,

43:47.400 --> 43:48.400
it's the end times.

43:48.400 --> 43:52.000
It's the end of all civilization.

43:52.000 --> 43:57.920
No, it's, it's not, it's not fair to treat audiences like this.

43:57.920 --> 44:01.840
You know, it's, it's not, look, violence is not the answer, but sometimes it could be

44:01.840 --> 44:05.260
part of the answer when it comes to Robert Barnes.

44:05.260 --> 44:06.260
I don't know.

44:06.260 --> 44:11.000
I would just get, get rid of that license of his, I think that that's the solution.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.240
You can't say that.

44:12.240 --> 44:13.240
You can't.

44:13.240 --> 44:19.120
I want to write one law for that word specific, just for the, not infringing upon freedoms

44:19.120 --> 44:24.160
of speech whatsoever, but if you say that before the election, it's the end of the world

44:24.160 --> 44:25.160
if you lose it.

44:25.160 --> 44:29.080
And then after the election you say, uh, these people were trying to lie to you about that.

44:29.080 --> 44:32.320
You lose something, you lose something, a foot, a hand.

44:32.320 --> 44:33.320
I don't care.

44:33.320 --> 44:37.440
Robert Barnes would just say like, I didn't say that and that may, maybe that's true.

44:37.440 --> 44:43.400
Unfortunately you worked for a news organization, quote unquote news organization that was their

44:43.400 --> 44:46.920
editorial stance and Alex screamed it on air for months.

44:46.920 --> 44:47.920
So I don't know.

44:47.920 --> 44:49.900
It's not even the pot calling the kettle black.

44:49.900 --> 44:54.000
It is just both of them are the fucking kettle and they're just arguing with each other.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Who's more kettle-y.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
Yeah, exactly.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.200
You're fucking both kettles.

44:57.200 --> 45:03.880
So Alex has now got confirmation, um, that, uh, this, uh, this cop who has passed away,

45:03.880 --> 45:08.560
uh, ordered the stand down and I don't know where he got this confirmation from, but based

45:08.560 --> 45:13.360
on the other news he's reporting, I'm not positive if I'm going to trust this.

45:13.360 --> 45:14.360
Let's get down to brass tacks.

45:14.360 --> 45:16.700
I have guests on that actually know stuff.

45:16.700 --> 45:18.600
We don't have to have sources.

45:18.600 --> 45:20.920
Most of the time you and I have people asking us what's going on.

45:20.920 --> 45:21.920
I don't mean that arrogantly.

45:21.920 --> 45:25.800
It's not like there's magic sources here, magic sources there.

45:25.800 --> 45:26.800
We're smart people.

45:26.800 --> 45:27.960
We've lived this, Bob.

45:27.960 --> 45:28.960
You're smart.

45:28.960 --> 45:32.680
I'm smart, but, but absolutely what you said last night is more targets.

45:32.680 --> 45:39.240
I have confirmed that a Capitol police supervisor, the one that ordered the stand down has committed

45:39.240 --> 45:40.240
suicide.

45:40.240 --> 45:44.760
There is an internal bulletin that at least four governors mansions in the U S have been

45:44.760 --> 45:46.840
overrun governors driven out.

45:46.840 --> 45:47.960
This is not too crap.

45:47.960 --> 45:48.960
This is real.

45:48.960 --> 45:53.220
Uh, and that there are attacks happening in governor's mansions right now, and that there

45:53.220 --> 45:58.780
are more attacks plan the next 24 hours, and it looks like deep States using Antifa and

45:58.780 --> 46:04.620
program Q tards who think they're part of an insurrection, uh, for Trump to actually

46:04.620 --> 46:06.780
bring in martial law against us all.

46:06.780 --> 46:10.840
That's why big tech is shutting Trump up ahead of actually declaring martial law that will

46:10.840 --> 46:12.360
probably kill Trump.

46:12.360 --> 46:18.340
So Alex is reporting that there were four unspecified governor's mansions that have

46:18.340 --> 46:20.600
been overrun and the governors have been fled.

46:20.600 --> 46:21.980
Dan, what day is today?

46:21.980 --> 46:24.280
Is the 12th we're recording this.

46:24.280 --> 46:26.800
What day did he say that 10th okay.

46:26.800 --> 46:33.340
How many governors were his mansions or all right, so we're, you know what happened here?

46:33.340 --> 46:34.340
I think I figured it out.

46:34.340 --> 46:37.820
So this isn't like Q no, it's not.

46:37.820 --> 46:40.860
It's not some kind of false reality is not at all.

46:40.860 --> 46:44.460
And he's reporting this as like in the present happening right now.

46:44.460 --> 46:46.120
I just got an internal bulletin.

46:46.120 --> 46:49.300
I can't believe they kept that quiet cause I haven't heard anything about, I think what

46:49.300 --> 46:56.540
he's talking about is on the sixth there were protests at capitals at governor's mansions

46:56.540 --> 47:03.100
and there were a couple of incidents where governors felt a threat.

47:03.100 --> 47:07.180
And I think that he's taking those bits of information that maybe he didn't know about

47:07.180 --> 47:12.020
until this point and pretending that they're happening in the immediate.

47:12.020 --> 47:15.740
That's the only thing I can think of because otherwise I would suggest if you're going

47:15.740 --> 47:19.880
to report that for governor's mansions have been overrun, you have a deep responsibility

47:19.880 --> 47:25.420
to name the States and have a little bit more fucking information about it.

47:25.420 --> 47:28.180
But Hey man, it's not a false reality like Q Anon.

47:28.180 --> 47:33.660
I was working with the president for real, you know, not in a fantasy world, not online,

47:33.660 --> 47:35.540
not not in a lie, but in the real world.

47:35.540 --> 47:36.540
So was Barnes on record.

47:36.540 --> 47:41.600
So I know we're not as cool as the game, but we're in the real world.

47:41.600 --> 47:44.400
We're not in the simulation.

47:44.400 --> 47:49.380
But those that are already in the simulation want you to only worship the simulation.

47:49.380 --> 47:50.380
It's very sick.

47:50.380 --> 47:51.500
It's very sad.

47:51.500 --> 47:56.000
And now I have this horrible news that governor's mansions, a bunch of them have been attacked.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.420
They're using this to go into martial law.

47:58.420 --> 48:03.180
They're not given up with only 10 days left of Trump, nine and a half days because they

48:03.180 --> 48:06.860
want to repudiate everything he did before he leaves.

48:06.860 --> 48:11.180
This story does not evolve over the course of the show and it is dropped on Monday.

48:11.180 --> 48:12.180
Yeah.

48:12.180 --> 48:13.180
That makes sense.

48:13.180 --> 48:14.940
Because Alex is just unsurprising.

48:14.940 --> 48:15.940
Yeah.

48:15.940 --> 48:20.020
So Alex is not jealous of Q, but I think a lot of people are saying that he's jealous

48:20.020 --> 48:21.020
of Q.

48:21.020 --> 48:22.020
People like me.

48:22.020 --> 48:23.020
Yeah.

48:23.020 --> 48:24.020
I would also say that.

48:24.020 --> 48:25.020
Yeah.

48:25.020 --> 48:26.020
Yeah.

48:26.020 --> 48:27.020
Yeah.

48:27.020 --> 48:28.020
And he, he wants, he has some things to say about people who think that.

48:28.020 --> 48:31.340
And by the way, there are all these idiots that send me messages and I see it online.

48:31.340 --> 48:34.620
Jones is jealous of Q. Q took over his audience.

48:34.620 --> 48:36.180
Q man hits the money.

48:36.180 --> 48:39.580
I was persecuted for supporting Trump and almost went bankrupt.

48:39.580 --> 48:41.460
I could have co-opted the Q thing.

48:41.460 --> 48:43.700
I tried to be nice to him and educate him.

48:43.700 --> 48:45.980
Don't believe people you don't know.

48:45.980 --> 48:47.420
Don't go to random places.

48:47.420 --> 48:48.500
They didn't listen.

48:48.500 --> 48:51.060
So he could have co-opted them if you wanted to.

48:51.060 --> 48:52.060
Of course.

48:52.060 --> 48:53.820
Here's him from a year ago talking to Joel Skousen.

48:53.820 --> 48:54.820
Let's hear it.

48:54.820 --> 48:58.580
I was thinking, I was thinking I'm just going to endorse it and then, and then co-opt it

48:58.580 --> 49:03.860
publicly and go, Oh, Q says this, Q says that, cause everybody loves a little magic stuff

49:03.860 --> 49:07.820
because it's, it's, it's, it's, it's definitely a delusional issue and it's sucking up so

49:07.820 --> 49:10.020
many good people into it.

49:10.020 --> 49:11.020
Yes.

49:11.020 --> 49:12.020
Yeah.

49:12.020 --> 49:14.300
So he was thinking about using Q like a puppet.

49:14.300 --> 49:15.300
Q says this, Q says that.

49:15.300 --> 49:16.300
And he did.

49:16.300 --> 49:17.300
He did try that.

49:17.300 --> 49:18.300
Yes, he did.

49:18.300 --> 49:19.300
And it did not work.

49:19.300 --> 49:20.300
No, it did not.

49:20.300 --> 49:22.740
Which led to him being more jealous of Q.

49:22.740 --> 49:25.500
And very frustrated.

49:25.500 --> 49:29.460
So Barnes gets down to the, the, like really the matter at hand.

49:29.460 --> 49:32.700
He cuts through the bullshit and this is really what it's about.

49:32.700 --> 49:36.660
Those people who are out there, you know, continue to crowdsource investigative independent

49:36.660 --> 49:40.900
research and review, continue to do independent grassroots journalism independent of and separate

49:40.900 --> 49:45.740
from and divorce from Q, continue to be proactive and productive, continue to support places

49:45.740 --> 49:46.740
like Infowars.

49:46.740 --> 49:52.380
Infowars is the model for independent information and a free press and free speech to stay alive.

49:52.380 --> 49:53.460
That's what it's really about.

49:53.460 --> 49:59.620
It's about transitioning people back from that, you know, making them feel safe and

49:59.620 --> 50:03.820
not judged for coming back to Infowars away from Q.

50:03.820 --> 50:05.060
Yeah.

50:05.060 --> 50:09.100
Because Q, I don't know if you know this, Chinese operation.

50:09.100 --> 50:10.100
Great.

50:10.100 --> 50:11.100
I'm glad to be here.

50:11.100 --> 50:12.100
Anybody's part of Q.

50:12.100 --> 50:13.980
You're part of a ChaiCom operation.

50:13.980 --> 50:16.540
Disown Q and return to Americanism.

50:16.540 --> 50:17.540
That's right.

50:17.540 --> 50:21.060
It's Manchurian Candidate 2.0.

50:21.060 --> 50:24.900
And folks, we have storeable food at the 2020 prices.

50:24.900 --> 50:25.900
Only a few days left.

50:25.900 --> 50:26.900
Good.

50:26.900 --> 50:27.900
Good stuff.

50:27.900 --> 50:35.480
So we got a real, just a scathing broadside attack on Q on this Sunday episode.

50:35.480 --> 50:37.760
And that's most of what it is.

50:37.760 --> 50:42.060
But I think that it's pretty important for Alex to lay this all out because he's got

50:42.060 --> 50:46.140
to disavow and get away from the stuff that happened at the Capitol.

50:46.140 --> 50:49.420
And people have got to take a fall for that, and the people that are going to fall are

50:49.420 --> 50:51.740
going to be Antifa, who are already villains.

50:51.740 --> 50:57.720
And QAnon is now not just some kind of a, hey, it's good, but oh, whatever.

50:57.720 --> 51:00.340
It's not the same.

51:00.340 --> 51:01.860
He's not just jealous of it anymore.

51:01.860 --> 51:04.040
They're bad now.

51:04.040 --> 51:11.780
And also apparently some hired militia who's unspecified.

51:11.780 --> 51:14.020
But yeah, so you can get away from that.

51:14.020 --> 51:19.660
And now when we get to the 11th, which is Monday, I really felt like it's Alex trying

51:19.660 --> 51:23.780
to turn to the direction that he's going to be going in.

51:23.780 --> 51:29.200
I felt an amazing return to like, this is so fucking familiar.

51:29.200 --> 51:32.140
This is like right before Obama got elected.

51:32.140 --> 51:37.420
He's just pretending that mere days ago people didn't storm the Capitol.

51:37.420 --> 51:42.660
Yeah, it turns out like, you know, you got nine days left till the election.

51:42.660 --> 51:46.620
And Antifa, they're going to rule you.

51:46.620 --> 51:54.620
Nine days from now, the globalist will be swearing in their installed puppet leader

51:54.620 --> 52:02.460
in exactly nine days to the minute, basically.

52:02.460 --> 52:09.140
Things kick off at noon Eastern, but they say about 20 minutes in, he'll be sworn in.

52:09.140 --> 52:13.580
Joe Biden, the open communist operative.

52:13.580 --> 52:19.480
And that's why from L.A. to New York to Austin, Texas, Antifa marched to the streets with

52:19.480 --> 52:25.660
shields and guns and weapons, saying we own this country, it is ours.

52:25.660 --> 52:30.560
And next, they're coming to your houses because by day and by night, they're Antifa.

52:30.560 --> 52:36.040
But their real job is contact tracers for the Clinton Global Initiative on record.

52:36.040 --> 52:42.800
These are the graduate students and students who are now your rulers, most of them pedophiles.

52:42.800 --> 52:47.220
So now we just kind of have a more extreme version of how he was trying to scare you

52:47.220 --> 52:54.540
about like job, or not, what is it, AmeriCorps and like civic work programs that Obama wanted

52:54.540 --> 52:56.480
to put in place.

52:56.480 --> 52:58.100
It's just kind of the same thing.

52:58.100 --> 53:02.100
It just feels like you just, you're just going to pretend that didn't happen.

53:02.100 --> 53:03.100
Yeah.

53:03.100 --> 53:07.320
Hey, I'm not going to talk to a Republican about tax rates because I don't care because

53:07.320 --> 53:09.460
guess what is underneath that conversation?

53:09.460 --> 53:12.280
I want to kill the left, so I don't give a fuck.

53:12.280 --> 53:14.620
Don't you dare talk to me about some program.

53:14.620 --> 53:15.620
The end.

53:15.620 --> 53:17.020
The programs are done.

53:17.020 --> 53:24.880
It's hard to, it's hard to engage on any argument that it's hard to believe that it's really

53:24.880 --> 53:26.200
what's being discussed.

53:26.200 --> 53:27.200
Yeah.

53:27.200 --> 53:28.200
Yeah.

53:28.200 --> 53:29.200
Here's what's being discussed.

53:29.200 --> 53:30.200
You want to kill me.

53:30.200 --> 53:34.320
Now we need to deal with that and you have nothing, like I don't understand why any Republican

53:34.320 --> 53:39.240
is allowed on TV to say anything other than we're sorry for wanting to kill you all the

53:39.240 --> 53:42.600
time because I don't give a shit what they have to say on laws.

53:42.600 --> 53:47.920
I don't give a shit what they have to say on fucking taxes or voting or anything like

53:47.920 --> 53:48.920
that.

53:48.920 --> 53:49.920
You guys want to kill me.

53:49.920 --> 53:54.560
I think that the issue is that the ones who do want to kill you don't feel bad about it.

53:54.560 --> 53:55.560
Yeah.

53:55.560 --> 53:57.080
So they're not going to go on TV and say any of that stuff.

53:57.080 --> 53:58.080
Yeah.

53:58.080 --> 53:59.080
Well guess what?

53:59.080 --> 54:00.440
That's the only thing that other people get to talk about.

54:00.440 --> 54:04.040
All Republicans only get to talk about how they want to kill us.

54:04.040 --> 54:06.000
That's the only questions I have for them.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
It's an interesting policy.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.920
I don't think the media is going to take you up on this.

54:08.920 --> 54:09.920
Yeah.

54:09.920 --> 54:12.360
I'm not surprised because they're also failing us in this regard as well.

54:12.360 --> 54:17.760
So speaking of media that's failing, Alex is failing himself and reality, but the reason

54:17.760 --> 54:24.580
that he's able to, I think, try to pull off moving back towards like just making you afraid

54:24.580 --> 54:25.580
of Joe Biden.

54:25.580 --> 54:26.580
Sure.

54:26.580 --> 54:30.900
Um, is that he's just decided that, uh, Hey, that whole thing at the Capitol was Antifa

54:30.900 --> 54:33.860
and Q and like we tried to stop it.

54:33.860 --> 54:35.700
We're the good guys.

54:35.700 --> 54:37.160
Those are terrorists.

54:37.160 --> 54:38.160
They don't hate the police.

54:38.160 --> 54:42.720
They don't want to be the police and they're the ones that went over a hundred of them

54:42.720 --> 54:43.720
on record.

54:43.720 --> 54:47.520
You know, their names dressed up like Trump supporters and Trump supporters tried to stop

54:47.520 --> 54:48.520
them breaking into the Capitol.

54:48.520 --> 54:51.560
Once they broke in, there was another contingent of morons there.

54:51.560 --> 54:54.520
We've tracked it to eight Jan and all the sites.

54:54.520 --> 54:58.800
So yeah, all of it is just that all the, uh, the good Patriots, they tried to stop them.

54:58.800 --> 54:59.800
It didn't work out.

54:59.800 --> 55:04.400
They were the ones who look like they were Trump supporters or just people in disguise.

55:04.400 --> 55:05.400
It's no big deal.

55:05.400 --> 55:06.400
We're still the heroes.

55:06.400 --> 55:10.720
We're the, uh, the oppressed where the aggrieved or even more aggrieved because they tried

55:10.720 --> 55:12.800
to make us look bad by storming the Capitol.

55:12.800 --> 55:13.800
Yeah.

55:13.800 --> 55:17.320
There's no moving forward until all of these people admit that they lied.

55:17.320 --> 55:18.320
That's it.

55:18.320 --> 55:23.280
You're like, honestly, I, how there's no change to Alex's programming unless he like, there's

55:23.280 --> 55:27.560
no change to those people listening to him unless Alex has to say he's a liar.

55:27.560 --> 55:32.640
Well Laura Ingram has to say she's a liar unless Lou Dobbs has to go on TV and say to

55:32.640 --> 55:36.440
the world, I lied to you because I want money.

55:36.440 --> 55:37.440
Yeah.

55:37.440 --> 55:38.720
But I don't think that even that would be that helpful.

55:38.720 --> 55:42.400
I mean, it would be nice because maybe it would ruin their careers.

55:42.400 --> 55:45.520
I mean, it's not going to, it's not going to solve anything, but nothing's going to

55:45.520 --> 55:47.000
change until that happens.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.360
But I also don't think anything will change after that.

55:49.360 --> 55:52.800
That has to, no, I mean, then we can start with other shit.

55:52.800 --> 55:57.840
Well, that's the first step though, but these media figures have to have some sort of accountability

55:57.840 --> 56:00.320
for their bullshit because they're the ones who inspired this.

56:00.320 --> 56:04.760
I agree that there should be some accountability and maybe they wouldn't be able to work anymore

56:04.760 --> 56:08.120
if they had to admit that they lied and that might be a positive.

56:08.120 --> 56:09.120
I would like that.

56:09.120 --> 56:12.320
However, they just get replaced by somebody else who's craven.

56:12.320 --> 56:13.320
And the audience would be...

56:13.320 --> 56:16.280
But at least they would know that eventually you have to admit you're lying.

56:16.280 --> 56:17.280
Well, yes.

56:17.280 --> 56:18.280
Eventually.

56:18.280 --> 56:20.320
Once people storm the Capitol, you will be forced to admit, you know.

56:20.320 --> 56:22.400
Sooner or later you have to admit you're a liar.

56:22.400 --> 56:26.640
At least you know that's in the, in your head because these people aren't going to.

56:26.640 --> 56:27.640
Enjoy your run.

56:27.640 --> 56:29.920
Enjoy, you know, it's going to be all great.

56:29.920 --> 56:30.920
Yeah.

56:30.920 --> 56:32.760
Gravy and tell people have an insurrection.

56:32.760 --> 56:33.760
It's just like Trump.

56:33.760 --> 56:34.760
Like, Hey, I get it.

56:34.760 --> 56:36.480
You were, you got what you got.

56:36.480 --> 56:42.400
I'm sorry, government and everybody failed and allowed you here, but this can't happen.

56:42.400 --> 56:43.400
This can't happen.

56:43.400 --> 56:48.600
Well, I, I, I'm of the opinion that even if those media figures were to come out and be

56:48.600 --> 56:53.520
like, I lied because I was trying to make money or whatever, it wouldn't matter that

56:53.520 --> 56:56.320
much because the audience wouldn't be disillusioned.

56:56.320 --> 56:58.240
They'd just be like, well, I got to find someone new.

56:58.240 --> 57:00.200
This person sold out or something.

57:00.200 --> 57:04.600
And Alex has the same complaint about the Q people and you're still saying Trump will

57:04.600 --> 57:07.360
be in office in nine days.

57:07.360 --> 57:10.760
Well, let's sit back and watch.

57:10.760 --> 57:13.720
And I know you Q folks aren't going to go away even once that happens because you bought

57:13.720 --> 57:18.560
into a lie, just like you sent the Nigerian email scam or that first thousand bucks and

57:18.560 --> 57:20.040
your family says, that's a scam.

57:20.040 --> 57:21.040
They need 5,000 more.

57:21.040 --> 57:22.280
You'll never get that either.

57:22.280 --> 57:24.320
No, I'll get a million now.

57:24.320 --> 57:30.840
And I send Prince of booboo, the 5,000.

57:30.840 --> 57:34.360
And after you've said everything you've got to the scammers, you'll hate your family for

57:34.360 --> 57:35.360
warning you.

57:35.360 --> 57:36.360
It doesn't matter.

57:36.360 --> 57:39.080
We're going to move on from that.

57:39.080 --> 57:41.640
I think Alex got tricked by those emails.

57:41.640 --> 57:42.640
Wow.

57:42.640 --> 57:43.900
Yeah, he is right.

57:43.900 --> 57:46.120
They will hate your family for warning you.

57:46.120 --> 57:49.840
I am aware of that type of situation.

57:49.840 --> 57:56.200
So I always enjoy it when Alex gets in reporter mode and he reports things that were brought

57:56.200 --> 58:02.960
to his attention by his wife's tennis partner, hard hitting scoops.

58:02.960 --> 58:08.520
In this next clip, we get some second or third hand information from somebody who works in

58:08.520 --> 58:13.520
security for Alex, who heard something from his mother.

58:13.520 --> 58:16.800
And now Alex is reporting it on air as news.

58:16.800 --> 58:22.900
I talked to one of our security guys that, you know, bonded security, armed security.

58:22.900 --> 58:29.200
We have her at the office and his mom is one of the head nurses at a nursing home.

58:29.200 --> 58:35.960
And she said, wow, they gave all the old people the shots and now a bunch are sick and none

58:35.960 --> 58:37.560
of them are getting up and coming to eat.

58:37.560 --> 58:40.800
They just got the shots last week and they're real lethargic and they're worried they're

58:40.800 --> 58:41.800
going to start dying.

58:41.800 --> 58:48.960
So I'll tell you next week, I'll tell you next week, how many, how many you're dead.

58:48.960 --> 58:53.160
How about you not talk about this until next week then, because the number could be zero.

58:53.160 --> 58:54.160
Yeah.

58:54.160 --> 58:55.160
You dick.

58:55.160 --> 58:56.160
Yeah.

58:56.160 --> 58:57.160
Oh no.

58:57.160 --> 58:59.120
But then you won't spend the next week in fear of the number not being zero.

58:59.120 --> 59:00.120
Oh yeah.

59:00.120 --> 59:03.760
But it's so important because my security guy talked to his mom and I heard this third

59:03.760 --> 59:07.680
hand that I've got to try and make you scared of something that may or may not happen.

59:07.680 --> 59:08.680
Sounds right.

59:08.680 --> 59:09.840
Sounds right.

59:09.840 --> 59:13.240
I think Alex is probably only reporting this because of his media diet.

59:13.240 --> 59:18.800
And he read something in the Ron Paul Institute website that is important.

59:18.800 --> 59:22.440
A nursing home at zero coronavirus deaths is then at vaccine residents for coronavirus

59:22.440 --> 59:24.080
and deaths began.

59:24.080 --> 59:25.400
Ron Paul Institute.

59:25.400 --> 59:31.040
So this article is about a nursing home from around New York called the Commons on St.

59:31.040 --> 59:32.040
Anthony.

59:32.040 --> 59:36.680
The most recent report from CNY central has the number of deaths there at 32 since December

59:36.680 --> 59:41.240
21st, which is when an outbreak of COVID-19 began.

59:41.240 --> 59:44.200
The outbreak predates the first vaccinations.

59:44.200 --> 59:48.080
Many residents and staff received the first dose of the vaccine on December 22nd, and

59:48.080 --> 59:51.680
the second doses weren't begun until January 12th.

59:51.680 --> 59:55.440
It's an interesting case here where the actual line that Alex says might not actually be

59:55.440 --> 59:58.520
factually inaccurate, but it's still a lie.

59:58.520 --> 01:00:03.240
It may well be the case that the deaths began after the vaccination started, but the headline

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.320
is being used by people like Alex and like Ron Paul to suggest that there's a causal

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.040
relationship there.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:13.240
This story is not interesting to Alex, except as a means to convince his audience that vaccines

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.240
are a deadly plan from the globalists.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:18.640
So he wouldn't be covering the story unless the message you were supposed to take from

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.820
it is that vaccines killed the people in the Commons.

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:24.680
And that's just not earned.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.840
That information is not there to be reported.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.840
Yep.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:29.840
Yep.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.240
You can listen to your security guy's mom, or maybe the security guy making stuff up

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.240
about what his mom said.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.240
Who knows?

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:40.280
Yeah, I despair for the possibility of anyone learning anymore.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.280
Nope.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.280
It's just not gonna happen.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.280
Nope.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.280
Nope.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.800
And I'd like to convince you even more of that.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:50.600
I can't wait, because I have got nothing but bad news on that front, Dan.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.280
Because it's over for humanity.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.280
Yes, thank you.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.280
There will only be lone survivors.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.680
I knew he was back!

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.080
I said it earlier, fuck yeah.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.080
You did call it.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.080
Now then, it's over for that-

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.080
Mike Adams.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.400
Oh, fuck all of these people.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.720
Fuck all of these people!

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:10.800
Well, Mike Adams, the health ranger, noted rapper, weirdo, Ebola curer.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.800
Sure.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.180
Yes, he did cure Ebola.

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:14.180
That's true.

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:21.000
He was sort of exiled from Info Wars, because he had an approach to the pandemic after a

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
while.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Right.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
People should take this seriously.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
That should be-

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
This is not good.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
That should be boiled down to, a lot of people are gonna die if people-

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.920
People keep saying the shit that I used to say.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:36.680
He joined up with Alex for quite a while in doing COVID denialism and COVID paranoia,

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:43.320
alternatingly, and then they had a little bit of a disagreement, and he was not seen

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.320
for quite a while.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.320
Quite a while.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.760
He is back, because now it's time to just complain about Biden, and the two of them

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.320
can do that just fine.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.320
All day.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.440
Joining us is Mike Adams at NaturalNews.com.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.520
Appreciate him coming on with us.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:00.240
He's written an excellent article, 25 Insane Crazy Agendas, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.800
will push on America if they seize power after rigging the election.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.040
Mike, thanks for joining us.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.500
What is your big takeaway about the state of the nation and where we are and what's

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.920
unfolding before we come back next segment and get into your report?

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:18.200
I would expect, if this is happening, that the two of them should really get into and

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:22.880
discuss what their differences were and why he hasn't been on for so long.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:26.320
Right, I guess we'll just pretend that didn't happen.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.320
Let's pretend that-

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.320
Nope.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.320
He didn't learn.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.320
Well, who's right?

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.720
Because he had factually different-

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.780
Nah, nah, it's fine.

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:34.780
It wasn't opinions.

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.580
No, it was opinions, because they were both making everything up.

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:38.580
That could be.

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:39.580
Yeah.

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:42.400
So, Mike is thinking that maybe Trump, right?

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.400
Sure.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:48.100
So, maybe he doesn't want to be president, again, not of America.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.040
Maybe he wants to start a new country.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.040
I'm removing Trump.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:56.480
He has a very, very narrow window of opportunity to stop this now, but Alex, for all we know,

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:00.440
Trump may have thrown in the towel at this point and said, you know what?

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.600
The swamp is too deep to drain.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.600
You can't fix the system from the inside.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:05.600
That is probably true.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:06.600
I'll give you that.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:10.600
Perhaps Trump is deciding that the only way to really fix America is to let the corrupt

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:15.920
system implode and fail and crater and then start a new system on the other side.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.200
That may be what he's thinking.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.200
We don't know.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.120
He may be thinking, let's start a new confederacy.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.160
Yeah, that does kind of sound like what he would be thinking right now.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.920
And what you guys are desperately hoping he's thinking.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:27.920
Yeah.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:28.920
Yeah.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:34.480
I'm kind of, I'm getting to the point where I'm like, yeah, you guys should go somewhere

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.720
else.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.720
All of you.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.680
I don't think, I understand that thought, but I just don't think it's functional.

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:45.920
There's uninhabitable places in Australia that could use a lot of Republicans, Dan.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.800
You meant uninhabited, but you said uninhabitable.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:53.160
No, I did mean uninhabitable and that's where Republicans should go and maybe they can terraform

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.160
it.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.160
We could send them to Mars and then we could move.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.160
We've got options, Dan.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.920
I understand there's some of that elusive free market over there.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:05.080
There's a lot of manpower that we're wasting that could be on Mars leaving us alone.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:11.840
So Mike is on, but he has a little bit of a time window and that's because Trump is

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:15.960
supposed to give a speech in the middle of when this episode is on.

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.960
Right.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.760
And it's happening because it gets pushed back and then there's a speech for the next

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:27.760
day at Alamo, but it's not the Alamo, it's Alamo, Texas, which is all very confusing

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.900
and it plays out over the course of this episode.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.280
That did not happen.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:36.840
We did not have a city version of the fucking Four Seasons.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:42.600
It's not for sure because Alamo, Texas is also like a border town and so there's a possibility

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:47.760
that that still feeds into the messaging that Trump would want to send with the border.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:53.320
It should absolutely, his time in public should begin and end with being racist towards our

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.320
southern border.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.320
You would think.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.320
That's great.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.680
But also, you would expect that he would want to give a speech at the Alamo.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.680
Yes, you would.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:06.160
Just like he would want to give a speech at the Four Seasons hotel.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.720
Right, right.

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.280
It does seem like a pattern.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:14.160
Anyway, this speech, Mike doesn't think it's going to be anything big.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.720
Trump set to speak in about 30 minutes.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.560
What do you think he's going to say?

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:22.280
Well, I have no idea what he's going to say because all the options are on the table.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:30.560
I suspect it's going to be kind of wishy-washy because he's still got a week or more in office

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.600
and he's still got options on the table and there are a lot of things that can happen.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:38.880
So I suspect he's not going to concede, but he's also not going to commit.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.080
I'm sad to say, but we'll have to wait and see.

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:45.040
He doesn't need to concede and he's already accepted that he's lost.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.440
So I don't...

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:54.000
I don't care what he does at all as long as he's quiet.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.360
So you know who Mike doesn't want to be quieted?

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.920
That's Pompeo.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.200
No, he should absolutely be quieted.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:08.160
It turns out that he wants Mike Pompeo to seize a bunch of URLs.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.880
What if he instead got sent to Mars?

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:16.360
Well, I guess that would be fine as long as from Mars he has a Wi-Fi connection and he

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.000
can seize Amazon's...

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I don't know if I want that.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.180
What I do want to mention, Alex, is that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has a move that he could

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:30.600
make right now to fight back against this big tech deplatforming of Parler and other

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:33.560
conservative platforms and individuals.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:39.360
Mike Pompeo could order the State Department to seize the domain names of Amazon.com, Google.com,

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.000
Facebook.com, YouTube, Twitter, and so on.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:49.760
Seize the domain names and charge those companies with acting as part of a foreign cyber warfare

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.480
attack on the United States of America to rig our elections.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.480
That'd go well, I think.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.960
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:58.880
I think people would respond positively towards that.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.400
I think it would give everybody peace of mind.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:08.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the government is taking over some of the largest websites as a hostile

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.720
action.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.720
Yeah, I think that's good.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:16.760
10 days, 9 days before a president who lost an election is supposed to go out of office,

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.320
his State Department is attacking.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:21.320
Yeah, that'd be good, that'd be awesome.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.600
I'm liking everything Pompeo's doing right now.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.600
It's really great.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:29.000
I love the way he's trying to convince people that it'd be a good idea for him to be president

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
someday.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.320
Yeah, good work.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:36.240
So Mike Adams, the health ranger, might not have gotten the memo that Alex hates QAnon

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.240
now.

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.240
Sure, sure.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.320
Because he's coming in with some Q shit.

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.600
He's got material that he could declassify.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.080
We know they have.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:50.320
Sidney Powell routinely spoke about the information, the Kraken details from the 305th Military

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.320
Intelligence Battalion.

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.720
That wasn't just fiction.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.320
So Sidney Powell submitted information in an affidavit that was supposed to be provided

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:02.600
by an anonymous source that she had codenamed Spider with a Y.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:06.640
Unfortunately she did a bad job of redacting her documents, so she accidentally doxxed

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:10.480
her source, who's an IT consultant named Joshua Merritt.

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:15.120
He claimed to be in the military intelligence, working in the 305th Battalion, but that's

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:16.560
all bullshit.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:20.400
Merritt was never an intelligence analyst and didn't even make it through the appropriate

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.360
training courses in the army.

01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:26.220
When confronted about this statement and the fact that it's clearly not true, he basically

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:29.800
said that he hadn't really read the statement he signed before signing it, which raises

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.440
a whole lot of questions about who in Powell's team wrote it.

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:41.240
Doesn't that mean that you, isn't that, can't you be like, barred or something held in contempt?

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.080
Put Sidney Powell in jail!

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:47.960
So part of the recent QAnon lore is that this 305th Battalion, nicknamed the Kraken, had

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:52.420
raided the server host in Germany and they'd seized a bunch of evidence of election fraud

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:55.040
and proof that like the CIA was involved and shit.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:59.520
This naturally all traces back to a Facebook post by some random QAnon follower making

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.320
shit up.

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:05.960
That's the story that Powell's affidavit was looking to reinforce, by way of assigning

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.840
the story to a meant-to-be-anonymous person in military intelligence.

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:14.000
The story is shit when you know that it's just coming from a QAnon Facebook account,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.840
but if you can pretend that there's some real deep insider named Spider, you can make more

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.000
people like Mike Adams buy it.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.560
Anyway, the point here is that people like Alex and Mike want whatever benefit they can

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:27.720
derive from believing the same stuff that Q followers do, and they want to use the same

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:32.240
sources of information that QAnon people do, but they want to pretend that they're somehow

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.120
above it, and it is pathetic.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:42.160
Yeah, the only, like when people are tweeting like, I can't believe Alex turned on Q.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:47.440
Believe it, but also what we should be doing is sowing as much division between the two

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:53.440
as possible while recognizing that both of them are complete liars and full of shit.

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.840
I want Q people and info-warriors to fight on the streets.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.400
And they will on their own.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:00.400
Yeah, exactly.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.840
You don't have to do anything for them to end up at loggerheads.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.400
I know, but it'd be fun to fan the flames a little bit.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:13.520
It's interesting because it really felt like there was an opportunity after the 6th where

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:20.320
they could get past whatever differences they had, but instead it seems like there's now

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:24.000
an irrevocable difference.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.500
You would think that until next week when they all decide that there is no difference

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.880
between them and it's all fine.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:34.240
I think that some groups could end up finding common ground, but I don't think Alex and

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.280
Q are going down that road.

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.840
We'll see.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:44.800
So Mike, he's learned that some hackers, some liberal hackers, have gotten all the data

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.880
from everybody who's ever done anything with Parler.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.000
I imagine he would be worried about that.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.480
Yeah, I bet.

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.080
There's credible information coming out today that then left-wing Black Hat cyber-hackers

01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:01.840
have been able to hack through the authentication system that ran Parler and that they are right

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:09.400
now downloading enormous amounts of data from Parler users, perhaps including the driver's

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:13.840
licenses and metadata geolocation data that people had uploaded.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.600
That's a breaking story right now.

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.880
I've been getting that from multiple sources.

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:21.640
It's my understanding reading up on this that this is not accurate at all.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.500
This is an exaggeration of what happened.

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:30.200
And it's just what people had posted on Parler, people were able to archive.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:36.420
Not that you had access to all the people's driver's licenses and shit, but I did try

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:40.760
to sign up for a Parler account because I wanted to follow people like Alex and it had

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:41.760
those kind of requirements.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:42.760
I'm like, fuck no.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:43.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:44.760
Absolutely not.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:45.760
Good God, no.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:50.680
Why, why would you, if you're a Nazi, why would you give somebody your driver's license?

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:51.680
Right.

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:52.680
That's insane.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:53.680
Yeah.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.480
And it's like the same people who are all up in arms about like gun registration.

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.480
Insane.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.480
Insane.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:02.440
Yeah, I also had a picture of my driver's license to get a place where I can tweet violently.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.440
Just insane.

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.440
Yeah.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:09.180
And so like I understand why there would be fear and concern about that, but my understanding

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:14.520
at the point of when we were recording this episode is that that is a deep embellishment.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:18.400
And I think that the reason that that embellishment works really well for someone like Mike is

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:22.100
that it allows them to talk about this kind of stuff.

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:23.720
They are going to go door to door.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:26.600
There are going to be death squads under a Biden-Harris administration.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:27.600
Cool.

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.840
And they're going to try to literally carry out a genocide against conservatives across

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:32.840
America.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:37.320
So because they took all the information from Parler, they got all the addresses of everybody,

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:41.960
now Biden's going to take Antifa and they're going to go door to door death squatting.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:42.960
Okay.

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.680
Dan, I have a question for you.

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:45.680
Yeah.

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:46.680
All right.

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:47.680
It's bad.

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.680
What happened on the 6th?

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:49.680
Right?

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:50.680
Yes.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.080
According to Alex and this, because it's Antifa provocateurs.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:58.200
Well, everything until that point was good though.

01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.200
Right.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.200
Right.

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.200
Right.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.200
Right.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.200
Now, if you don't want that to happen.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.200
Yeah.

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.200
Right.

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:08.360
I would say you would not use inflammatory language towards your political opponents.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.360
Right.

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:13.560
But if you did want that to happen again, you might, you would say that your political

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:20.200
opponents were planning on murdering you and that, uh, you know, I'm not saying that he's,

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.200
he's immediate.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.200
I didn't say that.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.520
He just said, Hey, we should go storm the Capitol building again.

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.840
But if I was somebody who believed things like say that Biden and Kamala Harris will

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.680
be sending death squads to my house door to door, I might think maybe what I need to do

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:38.960
is get a bunch of friends together and go storm the fucking Capitol building.

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:39.960
Yeah.

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:45.480
You've arrived at the thesis of my, uh, uh, neighbors.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:50.160
It's only five, but neighbors, I'm just a little tense, Dan.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.160
Right.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.160
I understand.

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.480
And it's, it's weird because like you could hear a lot of the stuff that they're talking

01:13:55.480 --> 01:14:02.040
about and be like, do you not recognize what, like what world we're living in now?

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:05.880
Cause like, listen to this, this could have been on his show in like 2010.

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:08.240
Yeah, absolutely.

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.200
And I've even, I've got a contact, a very reputable, a former military contact on the

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:18.840
ground, uh, in Maryland today texted me and said that they are setting up the FEMA operation

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:23.520
there in, in Maryland, a specific County, I don't want to name setting up tents and

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.520
emergency equipment.

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:29.800
I've had army special operations current call and confirm they are preparing for gun confiscation.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.560
They're preparing FEMA camps right now.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.560
Yep.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.560
Yep.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.560
They are setting it all up.

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.680
This is all in place.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:36.680
We're back.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.680
We're back to this.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:38.680
What's happening again?

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:43.360
They, we've talked a bunch over the years about taking them off the air and whether

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.280
or not yada, yada, yada, this needs to be taken off the air immediately.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:47.280
Yeah.

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.280
It's outrageous.

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:49.280
Immediately.

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:52.680
It's, it's, uh, it's outrageous because it is the exact kind of behavior that would incite

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:58.120
people towards the sort of behavior that we saw last week off the air now immediately.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.760
And it's so intentional, like, yeah, absolutely.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:03.160
It's absolutely intentional.

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:07.180
You are very clearly setting the stage for another of the same thing that you're pretending

01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:09.000
you didn't fucking want in the first place.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Yeah.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
And it needs to be off the air immediately.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.720
Well, I mean, let's go, let's go back to the terrorist edging analogy.

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:15.720
Totally.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:19.040
You know, it's not, it's, it doesn't work if you let everything go back to normal.

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:23.840
You've got to turn the temperature back up pretty quickly.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:24.880
And that's what we're seeing here.

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:28.440
We're seeing the exact same things that Alex always does.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:35.080
Uh, just as if, as if that event didn't happen because to Alex, it didn't, it was

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:40.480
Antifa, it was all fake, it wasn't the natural, it wasn't the natural result of this kind

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:43.920
of rhetoric where they're going to put us in camps and go door to door and kill our

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:44.920
families.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.920
I'm a good person.

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:50.640
I absolutely am not at least partially responsible for the deaths of multiple people.

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:56.040
That's definitely not Alex Jones's fault because Q and Antifa working together at the behest

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:57.040
of the deep state.

01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:03.440
Uh, yeah, he's, he's absolutely directly, uh, partially responsible for the deaths of

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:04.440
all of those people.

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:05.440
No, no, no.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.120
Listen, they're very, they're very clear about this.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.120
They don't want any violence.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.120
Should be arrested.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.120
They don't want any violence.

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:11.920
One hundred percent should be arrested and charged with conspiracy.

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:12.920
They don't want any violence.

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:18.300
I just want to reiterate to everybody here, you know, never initiate violence.

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:20.300
We always have the right to self-defense.

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:25.680
If commanders engage in violence against the American people, they're a general, a general

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.080
is more in command than the private that pulls the trigger.

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.080
They must be held accountable.

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.840
Well, I hope that Trump will announce shortly, although I doubt it, but I hope that Trump

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.140
would say we are in a state of war.

01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:40.920
We are now enemy occupied territory and that Trump would invoke every, every American citizen

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.040
to defend the Republic.

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.040
I hope that's what he says, but I don't think he will.

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.040
I mean, let's be clear.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:51.160
I'm saying if they start arresting and gun confiscating and killing Patriots, the generals

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.840
that are running this are, are, they started the war.

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.440
I'm all about defensive defense.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:59.840
I'm not about offense, but Americans need to know that, uh, you know, these guys are

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.360
already violent, the Nuremberg cove, the Geneva convention, but the forced inoculations are

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.360
trying to push.

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:07.680
They've already put us under COVID martial law and it's clear they're going to make their

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:08.680
move.

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:12.640
Mike, I'm not about, I'm not about offense, but all defenses actually are all offenses

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.080
really actually defense.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.080
Yeah.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:18.200
No violence offensively, but all violence will be justified.

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.200
No.

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:25.640
Um, I am challenging the health ranger to a fight whomever wins gets to storm the Capitol

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:26.640
building.

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:30.280
No, I will not sponsor this fight.

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:35.000
I can't believe that this is, I know I was listening to this episode and I'm like, is

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:44.040
this like from a two years ago, do they recognize, like it doesn't feel like they're living in

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:48.920
a world where people just stormed the fucking Capitol building.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.240
Nope, Nope, Nope.

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:55.280
I mean, you either have to completely lie to yourself or you're a complete psychopath.

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:56.280
I think it's the latter.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:57.320
Yeah, it has to be.

01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:03.280
And it's just like, that's just shit that you can't, we can't have this.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.280
They're doing it again.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.280
Yeah.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.280
It's outrageous.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.400
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.400
Yeah, I know.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.400
Yeah.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.400
Mike down for this.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.400
Cause you're going to feel like you're losing.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.400
Mike down for the rest of the show.

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.400
Yes.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.400
You're out.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.360
Uh, you're going to feel like you're losing your mind a bunch more.

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:20.920
Yeah, it is really happening and the way you can survive it because perhaps about 10% of

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:26.400
the human population will make it through is you have to be entirely self-reliant off

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.160
the grid as much as possible.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:34.440
You need to be able to grow your own food and to defend yourself and then, uh, survive

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:39.200
the onslaught of the mass illegal immigration that's coming, the troops, the Chinese troops

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:43.760
that are going to invade at some point, the, the, the government, uh, you know, jackbooted

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:46.280
thugs that Biden's going to unleash against them.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.280
They won't invade.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.600
They're already calling them helpers that they're visiting helpers.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:51.600
That's right.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.600
That's right.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:55.040
And, and by the way, they're going to, they're going to attack the churches, uh, just like

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.040
communist China.

01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:00.160
They're going to try to burn down the churches and arrest the pastors who don't go along

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.440
with the globalist agenda.

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:08.040
So, uh, if your pastor is truly teaching the word of Christ, he or she will be under attack.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:12.160
If they're, if they're telling you to surrender, then they, they will be allowed to exist.

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:17.400
So underground churches, underground farming, everybody needs to understand now we're losing

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:20.920
the country, we're going under longterm globalist occupation.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.760
The Republicans didn't know what hit them.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:26.840
Gorilla food farming is going to be a very big thing.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:27.840
Smuggling seeds.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:32.760
It'll be just like growing marijuana, growing tomatoes, growing pumpkins, growing squash,

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:33.760
growing.

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:37.740
Everything's going to be under the radar now, including money, by the way, because the dollar

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:39.160
will collapse.

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:41.920
Money will move to alternative systems, including crypto systems.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.980
I'm sorry to tell you this, but this is the world government takeover.

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:46.320
We warned you about it's now here.

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.200
They're coming to kill you and your family.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.200
Sorry, folks.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.200
I didn't make it up.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.200
I mean, they mean business.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.200
Bill Gates wants to kill you.

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:53.200
We'll be right back.

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.400
Stay with us.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:20:00.400
I don't know how you could behave in this way after, after an event like what we saw.

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:05.840
I just don't, I don't know how you can allow yourself to behave this way.

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:14.520
I am just reminding myself of something that the great thinker, uh, uh, Robert Barnes once

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:20.600
said, which is that, uh, they made these people feel like that election was the end of the

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:21.600
world.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.600
Oh yeah.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:23.600
The most important thing that ever happened.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.040
And that's how they convinced them.

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:28.480
I remember when Q was talking about smuggling seeds.

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:34.640
I remember all of those things being very important just a short period of time ago.

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:35.640
Yeah.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:36.640
It's almost jarring.

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:37.640
Yeah.

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:43.560
I don't, I mean, I, I just genuinely don't know how to like, I, I'm, I'm shaking, I'm

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:44.560
just shaking.

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:50.000
Like I'm in constant, you've motioned something needs to happen and I can't, I can't do anything

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
right now.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.600
I'm listening to him speak and I'm like, how much is a flight to punch Robert Barnes in

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:55.600
the face?

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.080
Shouldn't you want to punch Mike Adams?

01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.080
Sure.

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:00.080
Okay.

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:03.840
I put it, get them all in the same, put them in a line, put them in a line, I'll walk down

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:04.840
it.

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:11.000
Look, I know that you're frustrated with Mike, but I just, he just told me that only 10%

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.840
week, Oh, he's right, they should go underground.

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.840
All right.

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.400
We'll dig a giant hole beneath Texas.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:23.800
We'll put them all in there and then just close it up and then they'll, the mole people

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.240
will eventually come to the surface and take us over.

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.240
That's too similar to FEMA camps just underground.

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.240
No, they'll take us over.

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:30.240
I understand.

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:31.720
The Morlocks will rise once more.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:35.720
Look, you might be mad at Mike, but this is the last time maybe that he'll ever be able

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:36.720
to come on Info Wars.

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.720
Good.

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:38.720
Mike Adams, you're dead on.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:41.700
We are not exaggerating one Centella.

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:44.960
It's frankly worse than you even said worse than I can describe.

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.360
And I just won't lie to the public.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.960
This is the Megaton attack.

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:48.960
This is the biggest salt.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:49.960
People better get ready.

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:50.960
Yeah, absolutely.

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:55.200
And if I could just say on a personal note, because for all we know, this may be the last

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:58.460
time I can ever even appear on your show, who knows?

01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:03.080
But on a personal note, Alex, I'm one of the very few people in the world who, who I think

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:08.420
can have just an inkling of an understanding of the personal sacrifice that you have made

01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:13.360
in order to continue to express your voice and, and to fight for humanity.

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.520
And Trump has made the, you know, the greatest sacrifice.

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:17.520
Deep breaths, Jerry.

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:20.560
I've made, you know, I've been vilified and I've, I've had a sacrifice, but not to the

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:21.560
extent that you have.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:27.760
And I just want to thank you for holding the line and speaking for humanity.

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.760
Yeah.

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:33.960
He wants to thank Alex for speaking for, on behalf of humanity, at least my section of

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:37.360
it, which is my person, I'd say that Alex doesn't speak for me.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.320
Yeah, this is, this is a mess.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:44.640
Also, like you can't, you can't say stuff like we're not embellishing at all when you're

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:49.780
talking about death squads coming door to door to have a genocide on conservatives if

01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:51.420
Biden gets into office.

01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:53.340
You're playing with fire.

01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:55.000
This is, this is not acceptable.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.280
No, they're trying to do it, but bigger this time.

01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.280
Yes.

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.900
They're trying to do the sixth, but bigger this time and the fact that we're allowing

01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:05.780
this to happen as though that this is fine is insane because it's getting people killed.

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:11.380
And Jordan, they're laying down the preemptive justification by saying that like, oh, the

01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:16.600
Q and Antifa, they're planning to do, that's why Alex is going to go to the inauguration

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:17.600
on the 20th.

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:18.600
Nope.

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.760
Like they're planning to do more and do the same thing.

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:22.760
It's just...

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.160
No, they're killing people.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:27.680
As they speak words, people are dying due to them.

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:28.680
Well, look...

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:29.680
We have to deal with that.

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:36.320
The reality is that, you know, Trump might get a second term, maybe, tiny bit.

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:39.560
And if he does, maybe they'll get some of the things they wanted.

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:44.580
If we survive this, then we are the real media for America.

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:48.880
Because if Trump, if Trump gets a second term, if he pulls this out somehow that we don't

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:52.800
yet know, he, he would take down probably the...

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.120
Well, that's the thing.

01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:55.120
He's been surrounded.

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:56.540
They've ignored him.

01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:57.540
His spirit was good.

01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:58.540
He did so much good.

01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.520
And everybody got mad at him that he wasn't perfect.

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:03.440
Well, they're about to find out with Biden what Trump was holding back.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:04.440
Well, yeah.

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:08.440
And also, I mean, I've got very good, incredible intelligence that Trump has been threatened

01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:12.680
with detonations of dirty bombs and nukes and all kinds of things.

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:17.080
And you know, Trump doesn't want to see America turned into a radioactive wasteland.

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.060
Oh, he looks so strong at Wednesday's speech.

01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.060
So defiant.

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:22.060
I was there like 20 feet from him.

01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:23.060
They don't like me.

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:24.060
I'm so strong.

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:25.060
And I was like, my God, this is...

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:26.600
He looked like a superhero up there.

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:27.600
I'm serious.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:30.640
Superhero who whines a lot about evil.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:31.640
This is great.

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:35.840
Mike's like, yeah, if Trump somehow magically manages to get a second term, he'll finally

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:38.040
do the things we want him to do.

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:41.600
And then Alex is like, yeah, you know, the only reason he's disappointed, disappointing

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.920
is because he had, he was under threat.

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:46.800
Mike's like, yeah, they were going to nuke cities.

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.520
Get the fuck out of here.

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:49.520
Grow up.

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:54.240
Man, if Trump holds public office again, I'm storming the Capitol building by myself.

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.240
That's what I'm doing.

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:57.080
I don't want anybody else there.

01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.500
It's just me against the government.

01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.160
Just banging your head against the wall.

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:02.160
That's all I'm doing.

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.280
I don't care.

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:07.520
So Trump needs to give an emergency broadcast, according to Alex.

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:08.520
Sure.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.120
And then we get into some secession talk.

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.360
I think that they want to succeed.

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:12.360
Great.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:13.360
Good.

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:14.360
Good.

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:17.200
There's an oval office, not a farewell address, but an emergency address saying Biden's a

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.200
Chinese agent.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.200
Here's the evidence.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.200
He's going to cut our power off.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:22.000
This is a foreign takeover.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.640
You've got, the governors must mobilize.

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:27.120
You must have a constitutional convention, whatever you got to have.

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.000
We just have to America's under attack.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.140
He must raise the alarm.

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:33.280
He must just tell it like it is exactly right.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:38.480
And if for whatever reason he is unable to do that, then the American people need to

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:43.960
make it known to Biden and Harris and Pelosi and others that we, the people do not consent

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:49.240
to your tyranny, to your rigged elections, to your, your fraud, your false flag operations.

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.240
We do not consent.

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:55.840
In fact, we withdraw our consent from you and we, the people will declare a new independence.

01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:01.000
I believe all across this country, we will set up a new government, maybe starting by

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.480
storming the Capitol building.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.480
Yeah.

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:04.480
I'm going to have to go with this.

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:05.480
This is fucked.

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:08.280
I know it's, it's, this is fucked.

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.280
Yeah.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:15.200
I mean, like we, the thing that's really difficult about this is that like, we've heard talk

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:19.560
like this on info Wars a bunch over the years, but never.

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:23.800
In the aftermath of something like what happened last week.

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:24.800
Yeah.

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:31.880
Like that should be a wake up call for people, particularly people like Alex, that, Hey shit

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:32.880
can happen.

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:33.880
Yeah.

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:34.880
And you need to be careful.

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:35.880
You can't talk like this.

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:41.340
You can't, you can't say that Trump needs to get into like an emergency broadcast where

01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:45.440
he calls Biden, a terrorist, a Chinese agent.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:49.680
And if not, then we need to send a message that we're not going to consent to be governed

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:50.680
anymore.

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:51.680
Yeah.

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:56.920
I mean, I can't think of any way to send a message better than storming the Capitol building.

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:57.920
Yeah.

01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:01.160
But I guess that wasn't good enough is what Mike Adams is saying.

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.160
Right.

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.160
Mike.

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.160
So there we go.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.880
Mike is a real fucked up dude and Alex is really fucked up too.

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:07.880
Yeah.

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.680
But again, he just wants, I mean, largely it's about selling food.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:11.680
Sure.

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:12.680
Sure.

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:13.680
Sure.

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:16.560
If you're going to buy your storeable food, I'm not going to lie to you.

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:21.680
I've already started lying and put it and put the trailer up as we speak because I had

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.040
a feeling Trump was going to have it stolen from him.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.920
I'm already moving outside of Austin and already dug a well and the solar panels and all of

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:27.920
it going in.

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:28.920
What's your address?

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:31.480
I mean, this place is all going to be like when Christ pointed and said in 70 years,

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.720
none of this, there won't be one stone on the other tie to sacked at 70 years later.

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:38.640
I mean, I'm just telling you now, this is going to be here anymore.

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:39.920
All the cities will be gone.

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.840
So buy your storeable foods.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:47.200
Um, yeah, Alex keeps having very different stories about whether or not he has this bunker

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.200
set up.

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:49.200
Yeah.

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.200
I don't care.

01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:54.280
Um, anyway, we get into more secession talk when we come back from break and uh, Mike,

01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:57.240
what he wants to do is he wants Texas, right?

01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:58.240
Cause they're cool.

01:27:58.240 --> 01:27:59.240
Sure.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:04.880
He wants them to force social media companies to have like a million dollar fine every time

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:08.000
they censor somebody to put them out of business.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.040
And also he wants Texas to make their own money.

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:17.160
Uh, Texas could also pass a new legislation or even via a governor executive order to

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:22.520
say that any instance of censorship by big tech against the citizen of Texas will result

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:25.440
in a $1 million fine against big tech.

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:29.960
And then Texas could use that, uh, well, it would very quickly be at least a trillion

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.120
dollars in fines.

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:37.560
Uh, Texas could to defy, uh, the rigged election, Texas could launch its own currency.

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:42.960
And remember, Texas has its own, its own gold, uh, repository that it constructed a few years

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:43.960
ago.

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:47.200
Texas could launch its own currency so that people, and this could happen in any other

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:48.200
state.

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:51.840
I'm just using Texas as an example so that the people could conduct e-commerce and transactions

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:56.780
in an honest money system owned by the people rather than the fake Fiat currency that Biden

01:28:56.780 --> 01:29:01.600
will use to hand out more bribes and kickbacks to governors like Cuomo and Newsome and so

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.600
on.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.600
It's a great idea.

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.800
Let's have States make their own money.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:09.480
Man, have we ever had a situation in American history where different communities printed

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:10.520
their own money?

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.680
It gets very confusing pretty fast.

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:13.760
Did it work last time?

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:14.760
It didn't.

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:15.760
Oh shit.

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.440
I think we just didn't try it hard enough.

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:21.640
I think that that's what they think about the Confederacy, because it really sounds

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.480
like they just want another Confederacy.

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:24.480
Yeah, yeah.

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:29.600
As you know, Mike, even foreign governments and the IMF World Bank say only Texas could

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:34.080
lead a successful breakaway because of its energy, its oil, its infrastructure, and then

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:41.680
a large constellation of States from Arizona to the West or New Mexico to Colorado to Oklahoma,

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:44.440
Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Florida.

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.520
It would just be instant.

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:48.000
Texas could reconstitute the Republic.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.400
Well, absolutely.

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.320
There's a mechanism for doing that.

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:56.600
Texas could elect a new president of the new United States and bring together Louisiana,

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:59.720
Oklahoma, Kansas, and other States that want to participate.

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:03.640
And then Texas could order its citizens to stop paying federal income taxes to Washington.

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:05.320
And by the way, this was done before.

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:06.780
We can do it right now.

01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:09.380
So yeah, this doesn't sound like a good plan.

01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:17.880
So Dan, so if I understand correctly, I'd love to hear your breakdown.

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:19.960
I mean, I don't want to hear you break down.

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:21.200
I'd like you to break that down.

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.200
No, no, no.

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.200
I'll break down often.

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.480
I'm already watching you break down.

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:27.360
I'll break down later.

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:32.280
So Texas is going to declare a new president.

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.280
Yep.

01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:40.920
And then, so the United States government is going to watch Texas declare itself a foreign

01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:41.920
power.

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:42.920
Yes.

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:43.920
All right.

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:48.160
And then they're going to be like, well, of course you can have Louisiana and Florida

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:49.960
naturally because, you know, they would...

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:52.400
Colorado would be thrilled to join up.

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:53.920
Right, right, right, right.

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:59.520
And then they're going to get territory and money from a...

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:03.360
Oh, I mean, I imagine trade relations would be really wonderful.

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:07.520
Have they ever met the United States?

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:11.240
I feel like there's some issues that they might not be considering.

01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.000
Well, I mean, there's that.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
There's that.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.800
And I think you make a great point that I also think that there's just a logistical

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:19.440
issues that they might not be considering.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.440
Like what?

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:21.440
Trade.

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:22.440
Like trade?

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:23.440
No, no, no, no.

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:25.840
They're going to be able to sell their oil to foreign powers immediately.

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:30.280
There's no way that they couldn't just immediately start exporting oil.

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:34.160
You know, there's no kind of United States that would be like, hey, that's our money.

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:38.160
So we'll block you from selling this oil because it's ours.

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:39.160
Yeah.

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.160
There's some problems with this.

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:41.160
That sounds right.

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.160
But you know what?

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.800
They've got the biggest issue taken care of already.

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:44.800
Sure.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:45.800
And that is who should be the new president.

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.800
Oh, good.

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:52.480
But it's going to be states like Texas and like, you know, Idaho and Wyoming and so on

01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:57.920
that are going to really lead, I think, the the new society out of the collapse of the

01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:04.080
old corrupt America swamp, the the old empire that's just being looted in its final hour

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:05.160
by Democrats.

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:06.160
And maybe you're right.

01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:09.120
You know, maybe Trump doesn't want to be at the helm when that happens.

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:14.800
Trump would rather lead the new America out of darkness with a whole new honest money

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:19.800
system, for example, and new laws written for the people, by the people, rather than

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:23.640
for the corrupt criminals that are in the Senate and the GOP.

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:26.720
And by the way, I'm now part of the never GOP movement.

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:31.360
I will not vote for any member of the GOP ever again unless their name is bullshit.

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.480
So that's my statement.

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:34.480
Only Trump.

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:35.480
Bullshit.

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:36.480
All right.

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:37.480
All right.

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:38.480
Yeah.

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:39.520
This is fucked up.

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:40.520
You know what?

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:44.040
I was listening to this and I was like, is Mike Adams more fucked up than I remember

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:45.040
him being?

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:46.040
I guess.

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:49.600
Maybe it's just because I haven't heard him in a long time, but he seems really fucked

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:50.600
up.

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:53.920
I mean, he did say that there would only be lone survivors in the past.

01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:55.760
Yeah, but that makes total sense.

01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:56.760
That's true.

01:32:56.760 --> 01:33:01.720
That's exaggerating a medical situation in order to help sell survival food and shit.

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.680
That makes total sense.

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:07.280
Now he's just calling for open secession at the end of the United States.

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:11.300
In the aftermath of people storming the Capitol building.

01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:13.200
That's the part that doesn't make sense to me.

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:16.520
This doesn't even work for what Infowars is trying to do.

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:22.680
Here's my vibe from all of them right now, which is that they are a bunch of whiny babies

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:26.840
who want to take their ball and go home after they saw that they lost.

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:30.240
And unfortunately it's not their fucking ball.

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.720
You don't get to just go away.

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.320
And their home is shared.

01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:34.320
Yeah, exactly.

01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:37.240
We all fucking live there, so you have to deal with it.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:38.240
I...

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:39.300
Yeah, it's maddening.

01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:42.160
My politics are not divisive, Dan.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.760
You're trying to murder me.

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.440
There's a difference.

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:52.440
So Mike leaves, and Alex gets to complaining about foreign leaders, but not the ones you

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:53.440
think.

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:55.000
This time, take shots at Canada.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Sure.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Trudeau, you're in the crosshairs.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Yeah, why not?

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.320
They said we want to end America as an idea.

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:01.880
We want our globalist system.

01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:04.020
We want the Chinese system.

01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:05.020
We want dictatorship.

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:10.080
So when they tell you they're liberal and they're good and, oh, Alex has hurt people's

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:15.080
feelings and needs to be banned, all the idiots rolling over to tyranny think they're part

01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:16.080
of the power.

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:17.080
You're not.

01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:20.400
You're called useful idiots in the words of VI Lenin.

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.440
So here's what Justin Trudeau had to say.

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:33.760
There's a level of admiration I actually have for China because their basic dictatorship

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:39.360
is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime.

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.360
Let's hear that one more time.

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:43.200
Boy, that clip really cut off abruptly.

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.560
It's almost like there would probably be some sort of context to that.

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:47.560
That's weird.

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:48.560
Yeah, it really cut off quick.

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:49.560
Yeah, that was a sharp cut.

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:50.920
Alex has some commentary though.

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:51.920
Oh, okay.

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:55.720
And again, he's asked by a woman in the canned question, what is your favorite politician?

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:56.720
What's your favorite government?

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:58.800
Oh, it's communist China.

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.160
What's your favorite government?

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:01.160
They were on a date.

01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:02.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:06.200
So first I want to say that these comments were made by Trudeau back in 2013.

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.120
So it's a little old of a clip.

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:12.240
Second, although they're not great comments and they did cause quite a bit of embarrassment

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.800
for him, Trudeau didn't actually say that China was his favorite.

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:17.040
Here's his full answer.

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:18.040
Okay.

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:21.480
Quote, you know, there's a level of admiration I actually have for China because their basic

01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:26.000
dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say,

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.640
we need to go green fastest.

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:29.600
We need to start investing in solar.

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:34.840
I mean, there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about having a dictatorship

01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:38.680
that he can do everything he wanted that I find quite interesting.

01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:43.040
But if I were to reach out and say which, which kind of administration I most admire,

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.280
I think there's something to be said right here in Canada for the way our territories

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:47.280
are run.

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:51.600
Nunavut, Northwestern territories and the Yukon are done without political parties around

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:55.480
consensus and are much more like a municipal government.

01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:59.020
And I think there's a lot to be said for people pulling together to try to solve issues rather

01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:00.720
than score points off each other.

01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:05.080
And I think we need a little bit more of that, but Sun News can now report that I prefer

01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:06.080
China.

01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:10.360
So at the end of that quote, he literally said, people are going to do what Alex is

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:11.360
doing right now.

01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:12.360
Cool.

01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:13.360
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:16.800
The end of the quote is him making a joke about how right-wing media outlets would report

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.680
the story as he loves China.

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:19.680
Guess what?

01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:22.600
Seven years later, Alex, fulfilling the prophecy.

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:23.600
Yep.

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:30.600
I don't know if anybody who studies government would disagree with the idea that a centralized

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:34.480
monarchical power structure allows for quicker reaction times.

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:37.600
Yeah, I mean, if you're saying it- You don't have to get a bunch of people together

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:38.600
and vote.

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:39.600
Yeah.

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:42.040
If you're saying it outside of it being a prescriptive thing, like we should have that

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:43.040
because- No, no, no.

01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:46.000
If you're just studying it, then you'd be like, well, yeah, obviously, because that

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.980
guy just gets to say, do this instead of being like, well, we need to talk to our constituents

01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:54.640
and we need to have a vote and we need to write a bill and do all that stuff.

01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:55.640
Yeah.

01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.640
Descriptively, it's pretty hard to argue with.

01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:57.640
Yeah.

01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:02.440
But yeah, if you listen to the rest of that quote, it's really clear the thing that he's

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:10.820
bringing up is that phenomenon, how they can make their economy much more eco-friendly

01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:16.280
because of that basic dictatorship, as he calls it, but the government that he actually

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:21.120
says is what he admires is the territories in Canada.

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:25.480
It's a completely different message than what Alex wants to give across because he's a liar

01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:26.920
and he might not even know.

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:27.920
Yeah.

01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:29.920
I bet he doesn't even know what the rest of that quote is.

01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:30.920
Doesn't care.

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:31.920
Doesn't care.

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:32.920
That's bullshit.

01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:35.200
He just listened to the Sun News report that he liked China.

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:36.200
That's all you need.

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:37.200
Yeah.

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:42.440
So anyway, these people who like Q, they're fucking stupid because they think that they're

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:46.600
talking to military intelligence and that's what Alex keeps...

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:50.800
He keeps running into people at events and they're like...

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.120
Like Zack?

01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:57.400
I've literally been at rallies and they always have this weird look like they're in a trance.

01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:58.400
They walk over all...

01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:02.440
It's always like a guy wearing a Q shirt and he goes, Alex, I used to like you, but now

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:06.360
I'm with Q. I know you're bad.

01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:11.520
And then they'll always go, army intelligence, I'm with the intelligence.

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:16.640
You're like, well, really that's funny because the highest levels of army intelligence call

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:22.400
up and ask me what's coming next and so does the FBI, those that are good, and you think

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:28.060
there's like some magic mountain up there, the president calls us to see what we think.

01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:31.880
So he's making fun of these people for thinking they're talking to military intelligence and

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:35.280
then he immediately starts talking about how he's the one who talks to military intelligence.

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:39.320
All I hear him say is just like, I know I'm lying.

01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:41.120
You guys believe what you're saying.

01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:43.760
I know I'm lying because I'm not stupid.

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:45.440
I can weaponize this stuff.

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:46.440
You guys are following.

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:47.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:48.440
Don't you think?

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:50.920
You're not making any money off of this bullshit.

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:52.640
You should be giving me money.

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:53.640
I hate them.

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:58.400
So he's just fed up with these Q folks, but it's really important to understand that the

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:02.960
reason that he's behaving in the way he is towards them and about this whole narrative

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:07.240
is throwing them under the bus because he needs somebody to be the people who had the

01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:08.320
zip ties.

01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:13.240
He needs somebody to be the people who are scary and he's taught his audience not really

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:15.600
to be afraid of seeing Jean wearing Antifa.

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:18.160
So I assume he's going to denounce the Oath Keepers, right?

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.160
No.

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:20.160
Oh.

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:21.160
I have arguments with family.

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:27.480
I have arguments with so many people where they believed all that delusional crap and

01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.800
it really defeated us.

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:33.920
And then now I see how it's a robot army they control through 8chan who will do violence

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:42.400
and now they're planning to attack a bunch of the capitals during the 20th, which denies

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:47.340
us the ability to actually protest peacefully because they're going to have Qtards out there

01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:52.200
with their zip ties and their guns, believing they're about to overthrow the globalists

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:57.440
and they're being secretly commanded by some magic group that is the globalist.

01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:04.800
Q thinks it's good, but it's commanded by the enemy for sure.

01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:14.840
And it's roped in so many people that are now delusional.

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:21.000
All I want, man, you know, I really figured things out in the last couple of days.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.880
I kind of went next level and I already knew all of this, but now I'm totally in the dialectic.

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:28.400
I get the whole Machiavellian plan even better.

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:29.400
Stab yourself in the ears.

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:31.060
I'm sure they're operating according to it.

01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:32.060
With chopsticks.

01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:36.320
And God, is it diabolical.

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.320
Absolutely diabolical.

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:39.720
What?

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:42.120
Oh, man.

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:53.160
And people take kindness for weakness.

01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:54.160
And I just can't believe it.

01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:55.160
I've always been so loyal.

01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:56.160
I'm such a loyal person.

01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:58.200
The people that treat me good, I treat them good.

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.480
And I've just experienced so many people that don't treat me like that.

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:03.880
But I finally, through the years of working hard to found a crew that treats me loyally,

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:05.120
I treat them loyally as I can.

01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:06.120
I appreciate them.

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:11.600
But I've gotten to a point at 47 years old that I can't take this loyalty anymore.

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:12.600
And rat bastardness.

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:13.600
You know, I was watching...

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.600
Next, we have Roger Stone.

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:16.600
They're only blind hands, you know.

01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:17.600
I just go with my wife.

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:18.600
What are we doing?

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:19.600
What are we doing?

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:20.600
I don't know.

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:21.600
I don't know.

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:25.800
I wouldn't expect that Alex would like, ah, I finally get it.

01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:26.800
Now.

01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:27.800
Yeah.

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:28.800
Yeah.

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:29.800
He's supposed to have known all of this.

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:30.800
It just makes me want to start barking.

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:31.800
Yeah.

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:32.800
No, totally.

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:36.840
I almost just broke down and just started going, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff.

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:37.840
Yeah.

01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:38.840
Yeah.

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:40.280
It's so nonsensical.

01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:44.400
Those moments when he's just like, oh, I see everything in the dialectic.

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:46.960
I went next level recently.

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:49.040
It's just like, get a journal.

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:50.040
Yeah.

01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:51.040
Yeah.

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:58.560
I mean, it does go a long way towards explaining how he tells himself he's not a serial killer.

01:41:58.560 --> 01:41:59.560
You know.

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:00.560
No, no, no.

01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:01.560
I just got it.

01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:02.560
I've seen something new.

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:03.560
I'm not a serial killer.

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:04.560
It's a different thing.

01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:07.040
Well, we know that he's taken responsibility for multiple killings.

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.040
Yeah.

01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:09.040
In the past.

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.120
I don't know if he can talk himself out of that one.

01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:13.120
I don't know.

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:18.360
Anyway, these Q people, they were at the Capitol and they trained themselves to think that

01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:20.920
Trump was going to send the special forces in, right?

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:25.360
And so they saw Antifa and they thought that they were the special forces.

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:27.240
This is the story now.

01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:32.680
It was the Q people under Antifa's control who went in there like a group of morons.

01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:35.400
Antifa breaches it, they start it.

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:39.040
The Q people thought there's the special forces right on time.

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:40.840
They told us to invade at this time.

01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:41.880
They would attack first.

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:46.880
And they thought Antifa was special forces for Trump breaking into the Capitol.

01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:49.980
So they then flooded in behind waving in the masses.

01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:55.800
But luckily by the blessing of God, 99% of the hundreds of thousands did not go in with

01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:58.340
them.

01:42:58.340 --> 01:43:00.560
But I saw that and it made me sick.

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:01.560
Yeah.

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:07.720
And this is, I guess, how the narrative is going to land is the Q people thought that

01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:12.200
Antifa were special forces, but I thought that they were being directed by the deep

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:13.200
state also.

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.600
Like, what's going on here?

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:15.600
Yeah.

01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:17.480
Yeah, Dan, what is going on here?

01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:18.480
I don't know.

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:19.480
Bunch of nonsense.

01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:22.280
It's everybody's fault but mine.

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:24.280
I'm blameless.

01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:28.800
Now excuse me while me and my health ranger friend try and make this happen again.

01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:30.800
Stir up a rebellion.

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:31.800
Hey.

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:36.320
So I told you there would be hypnosis involved and Alex does go to calls.

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.080
You did promise to be hypnosis, Dan.

01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:41.840
He wanted to talk to people who were there and one guy believes that...

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:44.120
Give them your name and address, please.

01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:45.320
You were there?

01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:48.320
Well, maybe not inside, but at the rally.

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:52.980
And there's one guy who calls in who believes that there was a guy on a megaphone who is

01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:55.120
basically hypnotizing the crowd.

01:43:55.120 --> 01:44:00.360
Alex, do you remember the media tower right there up front and center in the back?

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:01.360
Yeah.

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:03.040
There was someone on that megaphone.

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:07.640
I know a little bit about neuro-linguistic programming, NLP.

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:14.120
Whoever was on that megaphone was literally, by the power of suggestion, hitting all those

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:16.880
trigger words, take it now, people.

01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:18.360
It's now or never.

01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:19.560
This is China.

01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.560
This is our house.

01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:22.560
Storm it.

01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:23.560
Push forward.

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:24.560
Hold the line.

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:26.420
They were saying everything that would rile anyone...

01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:32.760
And also read they said Alex Jones and Trump say so, did you hear that?

01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:37.120
I did not say that, but I hear that, but I can tell you what I felt and the things that

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:38.120
I did hear.

01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:41.720
So this guy is saying that someone was using neuro-linguistic programming to convince the

01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:44.500
crowd to act in ways that it wouldn't have.

01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:48.240
But I also think that all the things that he's saying, the person said, are exactly

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:52.700
what they would be saying in a bullhorn.

01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:54.940
You guys want this.

01:44:54.940 --> 01:45:00.400
You're just mad because it happened before you could get enough people together to succeed.

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:02.420
That's what's angering them.

01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:05.600
And you're gonna be mad when people start to take this seriously.

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:06.600
Yeah.

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:09.100
You're gonna be real mad whenever you start to get it.

01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:15.360
For a very long time, people have not taken the issue of right-wing media and how it feeds

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:18.320
into extremism.

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:23.880
They've not taken that seriously at all, which is, I mean, why we have any relevance.

01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:30.480
Why there's any reason for a show like ours to exist is because no one takes it seriously.

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.480
Yeah, exactly.

01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:37.360
And I think that there is an unfortunate, for them, trend, and that is that people may

01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:39.600
take this seriously now, and that's threatening.

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:40.600
Yeah.

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.600
It'll be good, though.

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:50.680
Because imagine if somebody was like, I don't know, on every TV show just sitting there

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:55.620
being like, hey, hey, that's bullshit, next.

01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:56.620
You know?

01:45:56.620 --> 01:45:59.760
Just like, hey, strike that from the fucking show, next.

01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:04.400
That's why I think I speculated about this back in the day, and I actually don't think

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:10.240
this would be a good idea, but if Alex is going to do his show, I have to be his co-host.

01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:11.240
You have to.

01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:12.240
Totally.

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:13.240
Totally.

01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:14.240
That's his version of net neutrality.

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:15.920
You need a fucking shot caller.

01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:16.920
That's what you need.

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:21.040
And there's some other callers who talk about boring stuff, about being there at the rally.

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:25.120
I didn't find any of it too interesting, but there's one other caller that made me chuckle.

01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:27.120
You know, you do have an alternative.

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:28.120
It's called magazines.

01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:32.440
You need to start a magazine to where we can leave it at dentist's office, Walmart, call

01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:34.280
it Lifestyle of the Free.

01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:35.280
And that's-

01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:36.280
You know, I tried a magazine, sir.

01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:38.120
Lifestyle of the Free sounds great.

01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:42.840
Do you understand that it had one one-millionth the response of a digital format?

01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:46.560
Yeah, but the digital format is not doing anything either.

01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:47.560
Look what it done.

01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:48.560
The country's still going down.

01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:49.560
I appreciate your call, sir.

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:51.800
I've got to hang up on this asshole.

01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:54.560
Dan, here's my solution.

01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:55.560
Yeah.

01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:56.560
Print media!

01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:57.560
Yeah.

01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:00.840
This guy, I love that call because he's like, yeah, you know, we need magazines.

01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:05.200
Look, I've done a magazine, cost a lot of money, didn't make anything off it.

01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:06.200
No one gave a shit.

01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:07.200
Do you know anything about the publishing business?

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:08.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:09.200
It's a loss.

01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:10.200
It's bad.

01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:11.200
I'm just going to throw money in a pit.

01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:12.200
Yeah.

01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:14.980
And hey, look, the digital stuff, lots more people see it.

01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:17.320
And the caller's response to that is amazing.

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:19.200
Digital stuff's not doing anything either.

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:22.600
Yeah, which, fair point, fair point, sir.

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:25.800
Alex can't reply to that, so he hangs up.

01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:26.800
Get rid of that guy.

01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:27.800
You're fucking worthless.

01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:28.800
That's what's happening.

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:29.800
Yeah.

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:33.320
So we come to the end of this and, you know, we needed to do Wednesday episode because

01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:38.360
this is a pretty fucked up, but at the same time, it's like, you know, we, if we waited

01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:42.520
until Friday, this would pile up and there wouldn't be, and who knows what's going to

01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:49.760
happen tomorrow or, you know, this is, we're not a news show, but the news backs up fast

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:50.760
now.

01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:53.920
We've already, we've already forgotten that Alex interviewed Mike Flynn.

01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:54.920
Yeah.

01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:55.920
Yeah.

01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:56.920
Who gives a fuck about that?

01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:57.920
Who gives a fuck about that shit?

01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:58.920
Yeah.

01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:01.560
So, um, anyway, we'll see what happens.

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:02.880
I'm sorry to do this to you.

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:03.880
Yeah.

01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:04.880
You're worked up in a tizzy.

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:10.840
Yeah, I'm not, I'm not, you get to process all of this and then the show and you have

01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:15.180
to edit it, you know, and that's, that's, but I, I'm just shaking with rage and then

01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:17.920
I walk away into the night.

01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:20.580
Some would argue that your job is easier in that sense.

01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:21.580
Some would argue that.

01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:25.040
I think you're describing me having to live with this stuff for a lot longer.

01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:26.040
Exactly.

01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:28.280
But you're better able to emotionally process it, Dan.

01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:30.120
I'm a loose cannon.

01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:32.360
Somebody should take my gun and badge away right now.

01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:35.960
Well, good thing you have neither a gun nor a badge.

01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:36.960
That's true.

01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:37.960
Yeah.

01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:38.960
That is true.

01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:39.960
That is a bonus.

01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:43.520
If you're not able to emotionally handle this much better, it's that I steal all the candy

01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:45.520
that our listeners send us.

01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:46.520
That's what gets you through.

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:47.520
Yeah, exactly.

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:49.520
If I got some of that candy, I wouldn't be shaking with rage right now, Dan.

01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:50.720
Well, I need it all.

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:52.680
So unfortunately, no candy.

01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:55.120
Well, you're the more valuable resource.

01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:56.120
Fine.

01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:58.920
So we'll be back on Friday, Jordan, but until then we have a website.

01:48:58.920 --> 01:48:59.920
We do.

01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:00.920
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:01.920
Yep.

01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:02.920
We're also on Twitter.

01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:03.920
We are on Twitter.

01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:04.920
It's at knowledge underscore fight and that go to bed Jordan.

01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:05.920
Yes.

01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:06.920
We're on Facebook.

01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:07.920
We are on Facebook.

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:11.720
If you could please find a local charity or a bail fund in your area to help out people

01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:13.360
who are still doing God's work.

01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:14.360
Yep.

01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:15.360
We'll be back.

01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:16.360
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:17.360
I'm Leo.

01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:18.360
I'm DZX Clark.

01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:20.440
I'm the juiciest ice cube.

01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:21.440
Andy in Kansas.

01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:22.440
You're on the air.

01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:23.440
Thanks for holding.

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:24.440
Hello, Alex.

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:25.440
I'm a first time caller.

01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:26.440
I'm a huge fan.

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:27.440
I love your work.

01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:55.440
I love you.
