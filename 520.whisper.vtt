00:21.040 --> 00:25.120
I have great respect for knowledgefight knowledgefight

00:25.120 --> 00:28.920

00:28.920 --> 00:32.040
I need knowledgefight Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight

00:32.040 --> 00:42.760

Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding me

00:49.240 --> 00:52.920
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work

00:52.920 --> 00:59.400
knowledgefight knowledgefight.com

00:59.400 --> 01:01.480
Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan

01:01.480 --> 01:02.040
I'm Jordan

01:02.040 --> 01:05.880
We're a couple dudes, I like to sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:05.880 --> 01:07.160
Oh indeed we are Dan

01:07.160 --> 01:07.560
Jordan

01:07.560 --> 01:08.120
Dan

01:08.120 --> 01:08.600
Jordan

01:08.600 --> 01:09.560
I have a quick question for you

01:09.560 --> 01:09.880
What up

01:09.880 --> 01:10.680
What's your bright spot?

01:10.680 --> 01:13.400
I'm gonna need a second to think, why don't you go first

01:13.400 --> 01:20.120
My bright spot Dan is, my partner and I don't necessarily celebrate like a anniversary of mine

01:20.120 --> 01:24.040
Well I believe that edible arrangements would beg to differ

01:24.040 --> 01:25.960
No that was for her birthday

01:25.960 --> 01:27.320
Oh birthday, excuse me, sorry

01:27.320 --> 01:31.400
That was twice for her birthday, neither time on the birthday

01:32.280 --> 01:35.080
But it has been four years in January

01:35.080 --> 01:36.280
Hey congratulations

01:36.280 --> 01:44.920
And for our relative anniversary time period, I bought her these, I bought her a bouquet of

01:44.920 --> 01:51.480
South African flowers, which she loves, she has no interest in like, hey these are roses

01:51.480 --> 01:52.760
She would have slapped me in the face

01:53.880 --> 01:55.720
Because I have never met her before

01:56.360 --> 01:59.800
So I got her these and I got her this beautiful vase and she fucking loved it

01:59.800 --> 02:02.840
And I feel like I crushed it

02:03.800 --> 02:06.920
I even put it on the scoreboard, I have one romance point

02:06.920 --> 02:07.480
Nice

02:07.480 --> 02:10.040
To her zero right now, she's got shit to do

02:10.040 --> 02:12.040
It's a tough year for most people

02:12.040 --> 02:13.160
It is rough

02:13.160 --> 02:16.680
Romance points are gonna be tough to come by, it's good getting that one on the board

02:16.680 --> 02:18.840
Right on the first of the year, get it on the board

02:18.840 --> 02:19.480
Nice

02:19.480 --> 02:23.640
Move on, it feels really good and she's very happy and it, yeah it was great

02:23.640 --> 02:24.040
Awesome

02:24.040 --> 02:24.440
Yeah

02:24.440 --> 02:29.320
My bright spot Jordan, a little more materialist perhaps, a little less romantic

02:29.320 --> 02:31.480
We got this, that box of candy

02:31.480 --> 02:31.880
Yes

02:31.880 --> 02:36.200
And one of the things that was in it was Velvet Crumbles, which is a honeycomb candy

02:36.840 --> 02:37.400
And

02:37.400 --> 02:40.760
That sounds more like a exotic dancer but that's up to you

02:40.760 --> 02:43.320
God, it's so good, I love it so much

02:43.320 --> 02:48.840
I ordered more of it and I ate all of the stuff that I ordered

02:48.840 --> 02:51.320
This is, this is how the sea turtles went extinct Dan

02:51.320 --> 02:51.960
I can't stop

02:51.960 --> 02:54.200
Do you know what happened to the sea turtles?

02:54.200 --> 02:55.640
They ate too much Velvet Crumbles

02:55.640 --> 02:59.800
They ate them to death, they would go get them from a place, carry them on the ship

02:59.800 --> 03:04.280
Because they stayed and they were watering and they did and they ate them all by the time they got there

03:04.280 --> 03:06.600
And they just kept doing it and now they're gone

03:06.600 --> 03:09.720
I was so close to ordering more and I have to stop myself

03:09.720 --> 03:10.120
You have to

03:10.120 --> 03:11.960
I'm just gonna eat it all so fast

03:11.960 --> 03:12.440
Yeah

03:12.440 --> 03:13.640
It's so good

03:13.640 --> 03:21.080
I love the crunchy bar which is the sort of the honeycomb covered in chocolate thing that you can get

03:21.080 --> 03:24.680
You could get it at like Treasure Island grocery store here in Chicago

03:24.680 --> 03:25.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah

03:25.640 --> 03:29.480
But it's so much better, the Velvet Crumble is so much better

03:30.200 --> 03:30.680
God

03:30.680 --> 03:31.160
Amazing

03:31.720 --> 03:33.240
Stop sending me candy

03:33.240 --> 03:33.800
Yeah, you got it

03:33.800 --> 03:34.280
But I appreciate it

03:34.280 --> 03:34.920
I appreciate it

03:36.920 --> 03:39.080
It's gonna be 400 pounds

03:39.080 --> 03:40.280
But I appreciate it

03:40.280 --> 03:41.080
Oh, God

03:42.440 --> 03:43.320
So, hey Jordan

03:43.320 --> 03:43.960
Yes, Dan

03:43.960 --> 03:48.840
Today we are talking about a little bit of stuff that has to do with Alex Jones

03:48.840 --> 03:52.520
We're gonna be talking about January 12th and 13th, 2021

03:52.520 --> 03:53.160
I'm Dan

03:54.280 --> 03:54.760
Here we go

03:55.640 --> 03:56.680
Black Jack

03:56.680 --> 03:57.400
Black Jack?

03:57.400 --> 03:58.040
21

03:58.040 --> 03:58.760
Oh

03:58.760 --> 03:59.640
Oh

03:59.640 --> 03:59.800
No

04:00.920 --> 04:01.400
Damn it

04:01.400 --> 04:02.920
No, that one doesn't work either

04:05.320 --> 04:07.320
I'm Dan, this is 2021

04:07.320 --> 04:09.800
Black Jack!

04:09.800 --> 04:10.300
Why not?

04:12.520 --> 04:13.320
I don't know

04:13.320 --> 04:13.640
It's

04:13.640 --> 04:15.000
There's no reason why not

04:15.000 --> 04:16.200
It's something

04:16.760 --> 04:17.720
It's not gonna work

04:17.720 --> 04:18.520
But it's something

04:18.520 --> 04:19.480
No, no, no

04:19.480 --> 04:22.520
So yeah, it's an interesting little stretch of time

04:22.520 --> 04:27.800
Alex is trying to rationalize again still the events of the 6th

04:27.800 --> 04:29.720
Not my fault, not my fault, not my fault, not my fault

04:29.720 --> 04:30.760
Q's bad

04:30.760 --> 04:32.440
A bunch of shit

04:32.440 --> 04:35.480
Antifa did stuff and now they're planning more attacks

04:35.480 --> 04:35.720
Sure

04:35.720 --> 04:38.280
Yeah, that sounds like us

04:38.280 --> 04:40.920
Yes, it's kind of a little bit annoying

04:42.680 --> 04:47.000
But at the end of this we are going to have something remarkable happen

04:47.000 --> 04:47.400
Okay

04:47.400 --> 04:50.200
And I'm so excited about it that I want to get down to business

04:50.200 --> 04:50.920
All right, okay

04:50.920 --> 04:52.680
But before we do we gotta take a moment to say thank you

That's fantastic. Have yourself a brew. How's your 401k doing, bro?

05:40.840 --> 05:44.640
We got to go full tilt boogie on this Watson. All right, let's just get down to business

05:44.720 --> 05:51.360
We ain't making that money off that heroin. Why you pimps so good. My neck is freakishly large. I declare

05:52.080 --> 05:56.400
Infowar on you. Thank you so much Isaac progeny of sin. Yes. Thank you very much

05:56.400 --> 06:02.240
But aren't we all progeny of sin? I believe Alex believes that it's in the Bible

06:02.240 --> 06:05.120
We are all born out of the first sin indeed

06:05.120 --> 06:10.740
Yeah, so also I want to I wanted to say to folks. Thank you all who support the show

06:11.000 --> 06:17.280
We are incredibly behind on shoutouts to the point where if you have not heard

06:17.680 --> 06:24.720
Let's give you a shout out. Please send a message to us and we will get get that in. Yeah, it's it's I

06:24.720 --> 06:30.800
Don't know we you hear how many we do up top. You don't want to hear 30 of those

06:35.560 --> 06:40.840
It's a bit and a structure that is really effective when no one's listening. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we loved it

06:40.840 --> 06:45.760
Yeah, yeah, and now it's impossible now. We still love it, but it makes us feel sad, too

06:46.280 --> 06:48.280
Yeah, and I don't want anyone to feel

06:49.320 --> 06:51.320
left out yeah or

06:51.320 --> 06:55.560
An uncared for so if you have a funny alias you'd like us to

Send a message and we'll get that take care of you have a timely timely joke. Oh sure. Yeah

07:02.040 --> 07:08.200
Also Jordan, this is very exciting. What's that now granted today is Friday when this will be coming out

07:08.520 --> 07:12.040
But on Sunday the 17th something very special is happening

07:12.040 --> 07:16.600
Oh, yeah, we'd like to give a preemptive shout out for that and that is a couple of wonks

07:16.600 --> 07:24.320
Eric and Michelle are celebrating their second anniversary. Oh, hey, happy anniversary to the two of you. Yes, indeed

07:25.480 --> 07:32.560
Got a very nice message very cute about them enjoying the show and Eric doing an Alex Jones voice. Oh

07:33.240 --> 07:35.240
to to say sweet things

07:37.600 --> 07:42.360
It's great happy anniversary to you to hope hope you have a great one this weekend and

07:42.360 --> 07:48.680
All the best. I don't know how you could say sweet. You have a lovely figure. No, that doesn't sound right

07:49.160 --> 07:51.160
Good. I love you. Yeah

07:53.280 --> 07:57.920
So Jordan, let's get down to business let's do it 12th and 13th coming right at you

07:57.920 --> 08:00.180
But first here's an out of context drop from today's show

08:00.440 --> 08:06.680
I'm a little plant that just opens up my petals and says I love you. See isn't that sweet?

08:06.680 --> 08:09.640
That is sweet. That is sweet. Just a little play

08:09.640 --> 08:14.120
I do like to imagine Alex as a Georgia O'Keeffe team. That's

08:18.480 --> 08:24.640
Welcome you into my secret garden. So on the two on the 12th. Alex is jumping in he's starting the show

08:25.280 --> 08:27.600
predicting violence sure and it's because of

08:28.480 --> 08:30.080
the CIA

08:30.080 --> 08:36.820
They're running Q anon Trump has declared a national emergency a particular martial law emergency in DC

08:36.820 --> 08:42.580
They have manipulated right-wing forces being programmed through the Q army

08:42.820 --> 08:45.420
To launch attacks this weekend across the United States

08:45.420 --> 08:51.340
So Joe Biden can bring in martial law Trump is calling for calm and peace and saying do not be part of this

08:51.620 --> 08:56.460
But the CIA Q operatives are telling you that's not really Trump's plan prepare to launch your attacks

08:56.660 --> 08:57.260
So yeah

08:57.260 --> 09:03.400
I would say that if your argument is the Q is like this operation to make Trump supporters look bad

09:03.400 --> 09:09.800
sure, you should you should have been really aggressively going after them long ago because they were making Trump supporters look bad for quite a

09:09.800 --> 09:11.640
While it see it wasn't hard

09:11.640 --> 09:16.280
No, I would I would argue that we didn't have to do anything to make them look bad

09:16.280 --> 09:17.280
No

09:17.280 --> 09:24.280
So I think that this is all like basically the preemptive stuff where Alex has a pretty good sense that there may be some violence

09:24.280 --> 09:30.920
Yeah, might be some acts of domestic terror. I'm friends with Stuart Rhodes exactly who's still conspicuous in his absence on the show

09:30.920 --> 09:32.360
Strange odd

09:32.360 --> 09:35.440
Yeah, so you got to preemptively explain these things

09:35.440 --> 09:38.520
You gotta you got to make sure that the audience has a ready-to-go

09:38.800 --> 09:43.920
Justification for why like this isn't a sign that our world is fucked right our information sphere

09:43.920 --> 09:48.120
You also have to text Stuart Rhodes and let him know that you're still on his team and you're just running

09:48.440 --> 09:53.280
Interference for him so he can commit the violence that he wants to don't worry Stuart. I'm still scared of you

09:53.280 --> 09:57.460
This is a smart move for all of us for me to say that you're bad. Yeah

09:57.460 --> 10:02.920
Yeah, so what's going on is that there's a globalist revolution that's happening and it's you know

10:02.920 --> 10:10.560
CIA running QAnon in order to precipitate this violence that will lead to the globalists taking over or something. All right, and

10:11.440 --> 10:13.440
Did you know that that's all in the Bible?

10:14.260 --> 10:18.240
Yes, we're in the midst of a global new world order

10:19.920 --> 10:21.920
Revolution against humanity

10:21.920 --> 10:23.920
And

10:25.800 --> 10:27.800
This has been foretold

10:27.920 --> 10:31.760
Whether you believe in God or whatever it is our psychic vision of the future

10:32.160 --> 10:36.580
Because the future is the only few ops pass. It's all a space-time continuum. You can move up and down

10:38.040 --> 10:42.280
We saw this psychically coming we were warned thousands of years ago

10:44.480 --> 10:45.560
And

10:45.560 --> 10:51.520
You're not just by John on the Isle of Patmos. Yeah, so time all right back and forth

10:51.520 --> 10:58.120
Okay, and so John on Patmos psychically right saw into the future sure to see Trump losing

10:58.600 --> 11:03.640
Yeah, you know, I always thought of time as being more like a singularity

11:04.640 --> 11:06.640
existing at all times

11:07.120 --> 11:09.580
Simultaneously now, I didn't know you can go up and down

11:10.320 --> 11:16.560
All right. Well, that'll be fun. Yeah, and and John of course in Revelation you could see all the

11:16.560 --> 11:22.280
Signs that he was talking about Trump. Yeah. Yeah, this is disgraceful. This is sacrilegious

11:22.760 --> 11:29.960
And the third seal was opened and its name was Medicare for all I I am not religious

11:29.960 --> 11:37.200
I don't have I don't care to be offended on religions behalf, but this is sacrilegious. Yeah that no, no, that's super bad

11:37.800 --> 11:44.500
But I am gonna be offended by this Alex starts talking about how he's what the enemy fears and then then he

11:44.500 --> 11:48.140
He starts playing on my side of the street and I am that thing

11:49.060 --> 11:51.060
the enemy fears I

11:51.620 --> 11:58.200
Am and it doesn't want us to declare that and so are you the thing that should not be

12:02.100 --> 12:06.180
Someday maybe even death would die to quote Lovecraft

12:06.180 --> 12:12.660
Oh no, oh no, so I kind of agree that Alex is what the enemy fears

12:12.660 --> 12:16.420
But not because he has any kind of competence or as a force of truth or any of that shit

12:16.420 --> 12:16.620
No

12:16.620 --> 12:20.180
He's what the enemy fears in the same way that a parent would fear a charismatic

12:20.260 --> 12:23.780
Weirdo trying to convince their four-year-old child that fire can't hurt them

12:23.940 --> 12:30.100
They aren't scared that the kid will see through the bullshit of the mainstream media's propaganda about fire being dangerous

12:30.140 --> 12:35.760
They're worried that this negative and insane influence will lead to the harm of people they care about fire can't hurt you

12:35.760 --> 12:41.220
I have candy in my van. Let's go as for the Lovecraft reference. Of course Alex goes with that one

12:41.220 --> 12:45.700
He's such a 101 dude. So of course, he's gonna throw out something from Call of Cthulhu

12:46.620 --> 12:52.040
So this thing that he's misusing and miss citing is part of a much puzzled over

12:52.180 --> 12:56.940
Passage from the Necronomicon that is referenced in the story that goes like this short quote

12:56.940 --> 13:03.020
That is that is not dead that which can eternal lie and with strange eons even death may die

13:03.020 --> 13:09.220
one of the chapters in that story the call of Cthulhu is the tale of inspector LeGrasse where you hear about a cop who discovered

13:09.220 --> 13:14.420
a group of cultists performing a ceremony and chanting thing Louie Ming and a goth Cthulhu really a

13:15.140 --> 13:19.780
Ming and I was with a thoggin beautiful language. It's meant to be unpronounceable

13:19.780 --> 13:26.060
Yeah by human tongue. Well, naturally this phrase loosely translates to quote in his house and really a dead

13:26.060 --> 13:31.500
Cthulhu waits dreaming one of the cultists to LeGrasse and terror greats old Castro sure

13:31.500 --> 13:35.380
He mentions that the passage from the Necronomicon

13:36.380 --> 13:38.420
Helps give some context to their chant

13:38.420 --> 13:44.580
So the reader can piece together that they worship a dormant God who's in this place waiting and dreaming and this God will never die

13:44.580 --> 13:47.960
It has a lifespan longer than death itself. Gotcha

13:48.260 --> 13:52.460
Anyway, the point here is that this phrase has nothing to do with what Alex is talking about

13:52.460 --> 13:54.980
No, that's not about death dying really at all

13:54.980 --> 14:00.020
I know that he thinks that he's really cool and that most of his points of reference are various sci-fi things

14:00.020 --> 14:05.380
He barely remembers but this is a little bit silly for one thing Alex should not compare himself to Cthulhu

14:05.740 --> 14:09.140
Cthulhu did not want to follow the Constitution and protect the Second Amendment

14:09.460 --> 14:16.340
It's really clear in the text what Cthulhu was interested in what's that quote those first men formed the cult around small idols

14:16.340 --> 14:20.660
Which the great ones showed them idols brought in dim areas from dark stars

14:20.900 --> 14:27.480
That cult would never die until the stars came right again and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from his tomb

14:27.480 --> 14:30.520
To revive his subjects and resume his rule of Earth

14:30.840 --> 14:35.280
The time would be easy to know for then mankind would become like the great old ones

14:35.360 --> 14:42.060
Free and wild and beyond good and evil with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and reveling in joy

14:42.060 --> 14:42.440
Oh

14:42.440 --> 14:44.440
so Alex is a lot like then the

14:44.520 --> 14:51.360
liberated old ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves and all of earth would flame with

14:51.360 --> 14:53.360
Holocaust of ecstasy and freedom

14:53.360 --> 14:58.560
Alex and the Lovecraft have nothing in common except that they were both racists the difference between them

14:58.560 --> 15:04.520
Is that Lovecraft got less racist as his career progress true. That is true. Anyway, I just don't like it when Alex reference

15:05.520 --> 15:08.880
Don't walk into Lovecraft now. Come on shouldn't be in Lovecraft

15:08.880 --> 15:14.920
I understand for him that like death may die is a kind of cool saying but in context it makes no sense for what he's

15:14.920 --> 15:21.240
Talking about. No, I mean it was a poetic way of saying he's fucking old and we're gonna die before he does

15:21.240 --> 15:23.240
It's very simple. Well, and that

15:23.960 --> 15:30.440
That would that is not dead which may eternal lies is basically saying that he's just gone dormant. He's not dead

15:30.440 --> 15:35.360
No, he's been sleeping for centuries under under in really a yeah, why?

15:36.040 --> 15:39.840
hmm, I mean why cuz the stars weren't right for him to come back and

15:40.840 --> 15:47.860
Reign and terror on earth. I never liked the arbitrary rules that are given to the old ones or this the devil or all of

15:47.860 --> 15:52.040
These things man, if you won't create ultimate evil buddy. Well, that's

15:52.600 --> 15:58.440
Fiction fair. So that's fine Alex making up arbitrary rules for the devil in the real world

15:58.440 --> 16:02.160
That's a little bit worse a little bit silly. Yeah. So anyway

16:02.680 --> 16:08.240
Alex was in DC over the period of time when the the storming of the Capitol happened and

16:09.680 --> 16:17.000
We're getting a new piece of reporting here. Do you mean Antifa caused all of our troubles forever according to Alex?

16:17.000 --> 16:20.560
Yes. Yeah, but also according to Alex. He almost got swept up

16:21.040 --> 16:26.080
They planned to SWAT team me in DC and blame me for what happened

16:26.080 --> 16:31.200
But that didn't go the way they wanted cuz the police refused to do it. We confirm that hell I saw it happen

16:32.320 --> 16:39.600
But I'll be honest. I was so exhausted and just eating a big meal on Thursday afternoon and under stress drank a half bottle of vodka

16:39.600 --> 16:41.600
So what I didn't

16:42.000 --> 16:44.360
Didn't even care when 100 police cars came for me

16:44.360 --> 16:49.840
I mean, I haven't even told you this whole story yet ladies and gentlemen, but I will tell you all of it

16:49.840 --> 16:51.840
I haven't figured out the beats on

16:52.120 --> 16:57.520
Yeah, I've got I've got a workshop in a couple of open mics before I can really start using this one in shows

16:57.800 --> 17:00.560
Yeah, I drink half a bottle of vodka and I had a big meal

17:00.560 --> 17:04.720
So I was like, I don't even give a shit that there's a hundred police cars coming to SWAT team me

17:04.720 --> 17:06.400
Yeah, what are you talking about?

17:06.400 --> 17:11.800
I I think maybe the reason that they were gonna take me out and blame me for storming the Capitol

17:11.800 --> 17:14.760
But then the police wouldn't go along with go fuck yourself

17:14.800 --> 17:20.480
I'm gonna go with the police didn't arrest you because you were right out at the tip of the spear yelling run away

17:20.760 --> 17:28.720
Run away, we can't do this. This is bad. Yeah. Yeah, so we get this kind of speech from Alex pretty regularly

17:28.720 --> 17:35.360
It's a it's that speech where he is like aha now I see everything sure now all has become clear to me

17:35.840 --> 17:39.040
But I now see the entire picture more than ever

17:39.040 --> 17:44.640
I mean every damn piece of the puzzle I can zoom in to almost the subatomic level. I can see the matrix and

17:45.520 --> 17:48.920
I know what their next moves are. I know how to stop them

17:48.920 --> 17:53.440
I know what's unfolding and I understand how I underestimated Q Q is

17:54.520 --> 17:55.480
100%

17:55.480 --> 17:57.400
globalist intelligence

17:57.400 --> 17:59.400
100% what's left of the US government?

17:59.440 --> 18:04.120
And it hates Trump and hates America and it's planning a giant violent uprising to bring down the country

18:04.120 --> 18:09.120
That doesn't mean you're bad if you were part of it or use the movement to educate people. You're not cute

18:09.120 --> 18:11.120
That's what made you pledge allegiance to it. So can round you up

18:11.480 --> 18:17.600
They're planning truck moms mass shootings bombings of capitals all over. I told you that Sunday from

18:18.120 --> 18:19.680
DC police and the FBI

18:19.680 --> 18:27.080
So this is again how he's preemptively constructing this narrative just in case there's bombings and stuff that are done by Trump supporters

18:27.080 --> 18:34.360
Um, you know at least Alex is on the surface telling his audience not to be violent

18:34.360 --> 18:38.160
Right, and there's some I mean, I guess it's better than the alternative in some ways

18:38.160 --> 18:44.960
But it's too little too late and it's meaningless. They stole the election. They're discredited. They're a fraud. So they need violence

18:45.480 --> 18:47.200
don't

18:47.200 --> 18:49.080
Be part of it

18:49.080 --> 18:50.840
It's a lie

18:50.840 --> 18:52.840
It's a setup

18:52.840 --> 18:59.080
And we now know the lie. We now know the setup. We know every angle of it

18:59.080 --> 19:02.480
And and by the grace of God, we're still on air for this moment

19:04.920 --> 19:08.760
Dug in hard when everybody else is being shut down because we'd already persecuted first

19:08.760 --> 19:12.920
We knew the mission and it's all the Holy Spirit the divine transmission

19:12.920 --> 19:17.400
I am receiving and I just opened myself up to receive the transmission. I give it as clearly as I can to you

19:17.400 --> 19:22.000
This is not me. I'm telling you. I'm gonna give you the transmission straight ahead. Stay with us

19:22.000 --> 19:27.240
I mean this show isn't Alex. It's God speaking through him. Yeah, which is fun. Yeah, that's not good

19:27.240 --> 19:30.720
Also, it's not a surprise to hear Alex insisting that people shouldn't be violent

19:30.720 --> 19:32.640
And the reason for that is pretty obvious

19:32.640 --> 19:38.680
Alex knows that there's a large enough population of people who are completely fried and disconnected from reality who are gonna be

19:38.840 --> 19:43.000
Disillusioned by the non-fulfillment of all their promised fantasies that they might turn to violence

19:43.520 --> 19:46.000
He's obviously not responsible for all of it

19:46.000 --> 19:50.960
But Alex's rhetoric has absolutely been a contributing factor to getting us to the dangerous situation

19:50.960 --> 19:53.080
We're now in and he knows that yeah

19:53.320 --> 19:58.680
When your allies storm the Capitol and you make your money encouraging people to do things like storm capitals

19:58.680 --> 20:02.600
But you don't want them to actually do it. You have a few immediate priorities

20:02.920 --> 20:08.480
The first is to come up with a framework to allow your audience to pretend that the actual storming doesn't involve you or anyone

20:08.480 --> 20:12.080
Like you this is achieved by blaming Antifa in this case

20:12.080 --> 20:17.760
There's the unfortunate aspect of the story where a bunch of the people who stormed the Capitol are public figures and have been very clear

20:17.760 --> 20:19.080
That they were doing it for Trump

20:19.080 --> 20:23.320
There's also a bunch of people involved who don't match your characterization of Antifa at all

20:23.440 --> 20:26.560
So to get around that objection Alex is there on cue under the bus?

20:26.560 --> 20:30.240
Which is probably gonna be persuasive to some portion of his audience totally

20:30.600 --> 20:34.280
The next most important thing you have to do is what you're seeing right now

20:34.280 --> 20:38.960
If you're Alex, you know damn well that this is not going to be a one-off event

20:39.480 --> 20:42.000
Alex has been friends with Stuart Rhodes for years now

20:42.000 --> 20:47.480
He knows the kind of insurrectionist threats that dude makes and he's supposed to be the public face for the oath keepers

20:47.480 --> 20:54.440
Okay, imagine who's and underneath that? Oh, I think we should kill everybody and as your subordinate

20:54.440 --> 20:56.440
I would like to follow up with your next

20:56.640 --> 21:03.200
Yeah, I mean Stuart Rhodes is the PR guy and he's talking about like rounding people. Oh shit

21:03.200 --> 21:05.280
Yeah, Alex knows there's gonna be more attacks

21:05.280 --> 21:09.940
So it's super important for him to create a preemptive narrative to explain them when they eventually happen

21:10.160 --> 21:13.120
This is achieved by more throwing cue under the bus

21:13.120 --> 21:19.260
If in the next few weeks you see instances of domestic terrorism and the people who carry it out appear to be Trump supporters

21:19.260 --> 21:22.700
Now Alex can fall back on saying they aren't really Trump supporters

21:22.720 --> 21:27.600
There are people who are misled by the insidious globalist psyop that is QAnon a psyop

21:27.600 --> 21:31.440
They're specifically running to make people like Alex and Trump Patriots look bad

21:31.760 --> 21:34.200
This is all very transparent and stupid

21:34.200 --> 21:40.080
But it's crucial for Alex if he wants to continue to be able to justify his behavior in the face of the inevitable

21:40.080 --> 21:43.800
consequences of his behavior coming to pass while he needs to be

21:43.920 --> 21:48.900
Against the inevitable consequences to stay on air right make money and not get arrested. Correct

21:48.900 --> 21:53.640
I believe that this is a very teachable moment in the aftermath of the storm in the Capitol

21:53.640 --> 21:59.240
I believe that you can see a very clear distinction between people who mean what they say and people who are primarily scammers

21:59.680 --> 22:04.520
People who really mean it are still calling for right-wingers to show up in DC on January 20th

22:04.520 --> 22:07.080
Mm-hmm people who really mean it are like the Q shaman

22:07.080 --> 22:13.220
Insisting that he was proud of his actions on the 6th people who really mean it or even like Alex's boring intern Harrison Smith

22:13.400 --> 22:18.340
Reporting that the Capitol had fallen and the Patriots were in control as the events of the 6th transpired

22:19.200 --> 22:21.320
Conversely Alex is a scammer

22:21.540 --> 22:27.000
He has a very profitable grift that depends on tension to continue and in order for that tension to exist

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
He has to operate in some dissonant ways

22:29.480 --> 22:32.320
For instance if you believe the things he says on his show

22:32.320 --> 22:37.920
Here's what will happen if Biden gets into office the literal Christian devil will rule America

22:37.920 --> 22:39.960
Yeah, Christianity will be outlawed. Uh-huh

22:39.960 --> 22:44.160
Everyone will be forced to get vaccines that will put tracking chips in them and kill them true

22:44.240 --> 22:46.240
Antifa goon squads will roam door-to-door

22:46.480 --> 22:52.660
Killing conservatives as they die of the vaccines and Alex will be one of the few to survive long enough to kill his neighbor and

22:52.660 --> 22:57.840
Feed them to his daughter. Don't forget Daleks with guns. Sure. That's it's somewhere in the middle. That's it soon

22:57.840 --> 23:03.920
Yeah, yeah, if he actually believed those things in any way, he would not be opposed to insurrection immediately

23:03.920 --> 23:06.240
I if I believe those things the only

23:07.200 --> 23:08.840
Reasonable response is insurrection

23:08.840 --> 23:08.960
Yeah

23:08.960 --> 23:14.520
There's no time to wait because this is a fight with the devil if this were just about policy then sure you can accept a

23:14.520 --> 23:18.620
Biden presidency where you try to lobby conservative Congress members to push for policies

23:18.620 --> 23:23.640
You'd like to see but all that shit doesn't matter if you believe Alex if Biden gets into office

23:23.640 --> 23:28.040
There's no policy discussions. There will never be fair elections again in the future

23:28.040 --> 23:28.360
Yeah

23:28.360 --> 23:31.880
if you believe Alex then this election itself was stolen which has

23:32.040 --> 23:37.200
Supposedly already been proven if you believe that and you believe the futility of any action

23:37.200 --> 23:39.520
You could possibly take once Biden gets into office

23:39.520 --> 23:43.880
Then it's a natural conclusion to decide that you need to do whatever you can

23:44.200 --> 23:47.260
Before he gets into office to stop that from happening totally

23:47.280 --> 23:51.440
This is the inherent dissonance Alex's non-violence position brings up

23:51.440 --> 23:53.600
He expects his audience to believe him

23:53.600 --> 23:59.360
But if they actually do the only conclusion they can come to is exactly the conclusion that the people who stormed the Capitol on

23:59.360 --> 24:03.700
The 6th did he's basically made an argument to his audience where he demands that they

24:03.920 --> 24:09.200
Definitively accept that he has proven every one of the premises in his arguments, but hey, man

24:09.200 --> 24:11.200
I don't want to take responsibility for you

24:12.320 --> 24:17.040
Conclusion. Yeah, look I can see through the matrix and I can see that your death is

24:17.040 --> 24:23.040
Imminent and what I would like you to do is nothing. Well, or you could give me money, too

24:23.040 --> 24:26.320
Yeah, I mean are you still on social media? Yeah, put out a link put out a link

24:28.000 --> 24:31.420
Band that video that'll do it. This is how we will crush the

24:31.920 --> 24:38.360
Feet Satan. Yeah. Yeah, you understand like this is this is nonsensical. Yes this this kind of behavior. Yeah

24:39.520 --> 24:45.820
Anyway, here we go again. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's a good thing. Nobody will face consequences for this type of behavior though

24:45.820 --> 24:52.920
That's that's really heartening to know. Mm-hmm. Yeah, so we get the narrative of the sixth just being laid out

24:53.840 --> 24:58.000
And I think Alex has pretty much found his for his final version of it. I

24:58.760 --> 25:05.320
Mean all this allowed on these message boards all this prepared and it was meant to be a giant insane rampage

25:05.980 --> 25:07.980
handcuffing killing members of Congress

25:08.560 --> 25:13.160
Your lockdowns led by anti-foes the shock force all in unison

25:13.160 --> 25:16.660
But the Patriots fought back and tackled them and helped the police

25:16.660 --> 25:21.880
So finally that Wow police stand down to let them in and they got to get the order commit suicide conveniently. I

25:23.440 --> 25:29.520
Mean this is serious. So this didn't work. So now they need to point. Oh, that's the Saturday and Sunday

25:30.000 --> 25:35.160
They're now saying we're gonna attack. It's the storm if I were officer Lieben goods family

25:35.160 --> 25:38.840
I would have definitely sue Alex Jones for defamation immediately

25:38.840 --> 25:44.120
He's reporting on air that their loved one order to stand down as part of a seditious conspiracy to storm the Capitol

25:44.120 --> 25:50.360
Which Alex can absolutely not prove and is just making up and then either killed himself or was killed to cover it up

25:50.360 --> 25:51.080
Yeah, yeah

25:51.080 --> 25:57.640
whenever there's something that the police should have stopped but don't it's important for Alex to pretend that some nefarious force order to stand

25:57.640 --> 26:01.520
Down to allow it to happen as opposed to them just being a Nazi too. Well, yeah

26:01.520 --> 26:05.340
I mean every single time there's been right-wing violence at a rally or a protest

26:05.340 --> 26:09.900
It's because of a police stand down that Alex aggressively asserts was ordered but then he never proves it

26:09.900 --> 26:10.640
and again

26:10.640 --> 26:14.640
The argument on the other side is they seem to turn a blind eye a lot of the time when there's these

26:14.700 --> 26:21.080
Yeah, these hard right extreme protests more than I think the Guardian just had something out

26:21.680 --> 26:27.040
That everyone already knew which is that police are meaner to the left. Yeah

26:27.040 --> 26:29.200
Yeah in the case of the storming of the Capitol

26:29.200 --> 26:35.320
It's additionally disgusting and offensive that Alex has decided to just pretend that a man who died by suicide was actually secretly killed

26:35.320 --> 26:38.640
So he couldn't reveal who had ordered him to order the stand down

26:38.640 --> 26:38.960
Yeah

26:38.960 --> 26:44.480
As far as I can tell officer Lee been good isn't someone who would have been in a position to make orders that the Capitol

26:44.480 --> 26:49.080
Police would follow it's not like he was the chief or even in the executive department of the Capitol Police

26:49.200 --> 26:54.920
So I can't imagine that he would have been someone who could have unilaterally acted in the manner that Alex is claiming it goes higher

26:55.040 --> 26:58.520
This isn't based on anything other than the fact that this man is now dead

26:58.520 --> 26:58.960
Yep

26:58.960 --> 27:04.760
The fact that he's dead makes him a useful prop for Alex to use in creating this conspiracy because it creates a dead end

27:04.760 --> 27:10.320
We could figure out who orchestrated this whole setup, but the guy's dead now, so he can't reveal that information which

27:10.880 --> 27:17.680
Obviously would prove Alex right totally. The guy is a thing to Alex not a person and I find that disgusting. Yeah, and

27:18.720 --> 27:20.200
He should be sued

27:20.200 --> 27:26.280
Really should like that's the way that's the I we're at the point now where it's like if Alex does this

27:26.280 --> 27:33.800
I'm almost like sending a message immediately. Like hey, this can't happen and unfortunately, you're the only person with grounds

27:33.800 --> 27:40.000
I I would love to sue him on like the world should work like this, but apparently the law doesn't count so disgusting

27:40.000 --> 27:44.880
Yeah, so disgusting the law won't just be like hey, you know what? You're right. He's bad for humanity

27:44.880 --> 27:51.320
so humanity has grounds I certainly hope that this officer's family isn't dealing with any kind of harassment from

27:51.640 --> 27:56.480
Folks who believe the sort of things that Alex is disseminating but based on the past

27:56.520 --> 27:59.640
Yeah and actions of Alex's audience if they haven't yet

27:59.640 --> 28:04.720
They will doesn't seem too unbelievable to think that it might be happening. No, absolutely not anyway

28:05.400 --> 28:07.400
Alex fancies himself

28:07.560 --> 28:14.120
Peaceful kind of protester guy. He wants a peaceful revolution kind of like Martin Luther King, right? No

28:15.640 --> 28:17.640
Martin Luther King

28:18.480 --> 28:24.600
Did black folks running around murdering killing white people ever get him freed no because most whites didn't know slaves they

28:24.600 --> 28:32.240
98% didn't but when folks saying Christian hymns and they watched him get their heads beat in like people like my

28:32.400 --> 28:37.480
Grandparents and their parents said this is BS man. We're not bullies. We're not doing this anymore

28:37.480 --> 28:44.520
We're Christians that is a fucked up sentence. I don't understand the timeline. Ah, I don't know what's going on

28:44.520 --> 28:50.120
Oh boy. So barely Alex's grandparents saw black people singing Christian hymns. They decided we're not doing that anymore

28:50.120 --> 28:52.200
Confederate royalty. What does that mean though?

28:52.200 --> 28:54.920
Like we're not gonna be racist anymore. Ah, no

28:54.920 --> 28:58.920
I think they're not going I guess they were all the ones who had the fire hoses

28:58.920 --> 29:04.200
I guess they were though they were Alex's whole family was holding fire hoses and they were like, oh I get it

29:04.200 --> 29:09.960
They're singing. Yeah. Also, I know that Alex loves to trot out this idea that he respects Martin Luther King and his non-violence

29:09.960 --> 29:11.640
And that's all good and well

29:11.640 --> 29:14.520
It's the standard line that you hear from people on the right these days

29:14.520 --> 29:18.280
But I wanted to discuss how out of touch he is with his own intellectual tradition

29:18.280 --> 29:22.840
Most of Alex's ideas are just reheated John Birch society talking points that have you know

29:22.840 --> 29:27.080
They have their underpinnings of Patriot lore for the last generations

29:27.080 --> 29:33.160
His favorite book the one that woke him up to the New World Order of course is none dare call a conspiracy by Gary Allen

29:33.160 --> 29:36.360
Interestingly Gary Allen didn't just write one book

29:36.360 --> 29:39.160
His first book is called communist revolution in the streets

29:39.160 --> 29:43.080
Which is all about how the civil rights movement is actually secretly a communist front

29:43.080 --> 29:45.000
It sounds like a better dance party though

29:45.000 --> 29:52.520
The book was published by Western Islands, which is the John Birch society publishing imprint and it has a foreword written by W. Cleon Skousen

29:52.520 --> 29:57.560
Another of Alex's heroes and the uncle of his regular infowars guest Joel Skousen

29:57.560 --> 30:04.120
The book has a slightly different take on Martin Luther King and goes out of its way to suggest that he was a violent revolutionary

30:04.120 --> 30:07.880
Who only said things about non-violence to appear acceptable in public

30:07.880 --> 30:12.760
In a caption on a picture of Martin Luther King on page one of this book

30:12.760 --> 30:21.800
Allen writes quote although King talks non-violence many of his alliances are formed with Negro leaders who advocate violence and give the movement its quality of revolution

30:21.800 --> 30:22.680
Jesus

30:22.680 --> 30:28.520
This is an important idea of the anti-communists that the entirety of the civil rights movement was a communist facade

30:28.520 --> 30:33.480
And that Martin Luther King was essentially there to trick white people into thinking it was a peaceful revolution

30:33.480 --> 30:39.720
From page two quote King closed his talk by declaring that of course he meant this should be done non-violently

30:39.720 --> 30:47.400
Many in the crowd laughed openly they felt the term non-violence was a sham and was being used by King primarily for public relations reasons

30:47.400 --> 30:56.760
Whether Alex knows it or understands it is irrelevant what matters is that the system that he supports and all of his intellectual influences who molded his beliefs when he was young

30:56.760 --> 31:04.360
Were deeply racist people who had a particular hatred of Martin Luther King not because he was violent but because he was Christian and sang hymns

31:04.360 --> 31:11.160
Yeah I guess what I'm getting at is that Alex Jones is a coward he's not even willing to live his beliefs the way his forefathers would have

31:11.160 --> 31:19.000
Totally He knows that it looks pretty racist to be opposed to Martin Luther King these days so he just conveniently pretends that that's not part of his big worldview

31:19.000 --> 31:31.400
Yeah yeah I mean for someone to talk about cops standing down in the face of something and then to talk about Martin Luther King Jr. very shortly afterwards

31:31.400 --> 31:36.760
Is someone who does not know anything about Martin Luther King Jr. It's another little interesting element of dissonance

31:36.760 --> 31:48.360
Yeah yeah yeah it's like it's like somebody being like hey my my dad was in the FBI and you know when they murdered Fred Hampton he was like that was one too many bullets for me

31:48.360 --> 32:00.040
I'm gonna choose the path of peace from here on out yeah yeah something that I find so fascinating is like how much Alex wants to live in the shadow of his own life

32:00.040 --> 32:13.240
In the shadow of these anti-communist heroes and like it's so his worldview all of this is but he refuses to take ownership of these things that he knows are like absolutely I can't say that

32:13.240 --> 32:26.120
Yeah I can't uh I can't be against the civil rights act you know it's it's one of those things where it's like you can see how bankrupt their ideology is over time because they just abandon shit after it

32:26.120 --> 32:40.840
You know like oh I don't know if they abandon it they just refuse to accept it publicly well yeah well I mean yeah I mean that that like Martin Luther King Jr. is so fucking revered that the right has to now use him to try and reinstitute slavery

32:40.840 --> 32:49.240
They can't like I would they can't ignore it or say he's a bad guy they have to be like he's such a great guy he would have wanted us to own you again I'm sorry

32:49.240 --> 32:55.400
I would bet that if you got Alex drunk enough he would talk about how he's a commie oh totally I'm sure he was a commie

32:55.400 --> 33:01.560
Anyway there's truck bombs coming uh but also Alex says you all got to go to your capitals? Sure

33:01.560 --> 33:09.080
They're gonna set off truck bombs in major cities this weekend or next week that's their plan I told you it's coming you already saw it

33:09.080 --> 33:15.560
Did Stewart do this? They're gonna stage mass shootings and they're gonna put it all over the news and say you did it

33:15.560 --> 33:22.280
Why would we do it? We won. So I will be out at the Capitol this weekend but not with guns

33:22.280 --> 33:30.520
I knew this was all coming I'll be in an armored vehicle and I'm gonna be documenting who did what and what happened but I can't be in all 50 capitals

33:30.520 --> 33:36.680
So go out there pray to Jesus have your video camera and document every person

33:36.680 --> 33:46.520
Oh you don't want to do that? Isn't it kind of contradictory or maybe just unwise to tell your audience like hey they're gonna be bombing a bunch of shit so everybody go to your capitals

33:46.520 --> 33:55.080
Sure yeah now I'll be fine because I'm in a tank yeah you guys are gonna get some shrapnel I am fairly certain that's fucked up that's not good

33:55.080 --> 34:02.600
If he's saying that there's gonna be like staging of mass shootings and bombings I would say for the protection of your audience stay home

34:02.600 --> 34:11.160
Hey listen they're gonna blow everybody up mm-hmm they're gonna be killing you left and right and that's why you gotta go with a camera

34:11.160 --> 34:22.200
That seems seems seems weird no it's weird no it's bad anyway uh there were some I'll just be in my tank looking like the people that I'm supposed to tell you are Antifa?

34:22.200 --> 34:31.640
Sure yeah uh there were some people who are not Antifa actually who were involved on the sixth no these are the people who placed bombs no that's not there were a couple pipe bombs none of them Antifa

34:31.640 --> 34:37.880
Uh no turns out Alex does know who they are though oh you can't miss these Antifa you can't miss

34:37.880 --> 34:42.360
You'll see Chinese state party people like the guy that planted the pipe bombs they just showed

34:42.360 --> 34:52.040
You'll see Chinese agents they'll all be wearing masks you'll see Antifa wearing black that wear pink bandanas as signifiers and then guys in camo covering their faces with backpacks as well

34:52.040 --> 34:59.880
They are deep state mercs, Dyncor, Halliburton you name it they're making a full move on us

34:59.880 --> 35:04.360
Alex is making all of that up there is nothing real about any of that

35:04.360 --> 35:15.080
You know what is boggling my mind what's that is that he literally did say it uh and it is true they were planning on taking hostages and assassinating members of congress

35:15.080 --> 35:20.680
Yes that was a well that's something that is that sounds like a conspiracy theory Dan

35:21.480 --> 35:27.720
Uh-huh yeah it's something that is being discussed certainly there are people who have some suspicions

35:27.720 --> 35:38.520
That that is uh that was the plan there are indications of that uh Alex hard not to learn more and think oh shit that's and they had members of congress helping him that's not good

35:38.520 --> 35:49.080
Alex Alex is uh definitely of the mind in terms of reporting that it was supposed to be way worse yeah yeah um and that might be that might be the case

35:49.080 --> 35:55.640
I think there's a lot of details that are yet to be solidly understood but some of the indications are really really terrifying

35:55.640 --> 36:08.440
Yeah um so you know there's there's some issues uh between Alex and Q I think that there's some strange uh stuff like why didn't you do this earlier

36:08.440 --> 36:15.160
No no no no if you like oh it took you years to get to the point where you realized it was actually the deep state

36:15.160 --> 36:23.240
Hey no remember only two years ago when he said he could see through the matrix and saw their plan and knew what was happening

36:23.240 --> 36:35.480
Yeah like on a he could read the code on a granular scale yeah well it turns out uh now he understands all of it and now he sees why QAnon attacked him in the early stages

36:35.480 --> 36:47.320
I'm just gonna throw this out there Dan if he said the same thing two years ago and got everything wrong okay why would I then trust him now when he says that

36:47.320 --> 36:49.720
Because you've forgotten that he said all that stuff

36:49.720 --> 36:51.720
Oh that's wise I wish I could do that

36:51.720 --> 36:56.440
Yeah no unfortunately not but Q attacked Alex early on and here's why okay

36:56.440 --> 37:05.960
This isn't my opinion we know where this is going we know why Q attacked me early on because Q figured out I would figure out what it was

37:05.960 --> 37:06.680
Four years later

37:06.680 --> 37:21.480
And I know U.S. intelligence was involved in it it was even started under orders by some campaign officials in the Trump operation they said oh let's do this so we can put out information like Jones puts out against Hillary and the rest of them but so nobody gets sued

37:21.480 --> 37:27.480
But it was instantly taken away in three weeks by the group that tricked the Trump campaign people to authorize it

37:27.480 --> 37:31.560
I don't believe any of this stuff but if it is true that seems insanely illegal

37:31.560 --> 37:32.280
Uh yeah

37:32.280 --> 37:33.320
That seems

37:33.320 --> 37:34.440
Also again

37:34.440 --> 37:39.400
The Trump was officially running QAnon at the beginning his administration

37:39.400 --> 37:44.200
Why do you keep telling me how shitty your God King is at doing this

37:44.200 --> 37:53.160
It took three weeks to steal the greatest fucking conspiracy from the government that's all it took? It took three weeks?

37:53.160 --> 37:54.520
And how?

37:54.520 --> 38:01.160
What did they change the password and put two step notification what what are we doing here? Was it that easy?

38:02.040 --> 38:14.120
And if that's the case right and all this happened at three weeks in it got uh commandeered by these nefarious people wouldn't it be in the best interest of the Trump campaign to like really make sure that people understand

38:14.120 --> 38:20.920
That this was something that was a malevolent force so it didn't end up becoming such a huge part of the Trump base

38:20.920 --> 38:28.280
Or at the very least utilizing the vast resources of the United States government to take it back

38:28.280 --> 38:29.320
Oh yeah they could do that too

38:29.320 --> 38:38.680
They could do that oh okay here's what happened in three weeks they stole our access to Q so then about an hour later we stole it back it's not hard we're the government

38:38.680 --> 38:46.520
Yeah so that's dumb um I do love the idea though they're like they attacked me because they knew I was the only person who could get to the bottom of it

38:46.520 --> 38:54.920
God damn it yeah the only person greatest detective the only person besides everyone else yeah god I hate him

38:54.920 --> 39:03.000
So um involving the six there's some other things that are starting to come to light that are a little bit problematic for Alex's uh narrative

39:03.000 --> 39:17.000
Namely that uh there seem to be a lot of proud boys uh who are around the Capitol and sometimes uh you know there's some indications that uh even some of the proud boys might have been there right at the get going getting going part

39:17.000 --> 39:20.840
And so now Alex might have to say some bad things about the proud boys

39:20.840 --> 39:44.600
And I'm very close to revealing information I just want to be 100 accurate when I do it I'm about 95% right now that a major patriot group was infiltrated ahead of this event their leader was arrested so that a globalist fed could be put in charge of it so they could also be part of it

39:44.600 --> 39:48.280
I know the FBI knows it because they were in command of it

39:48.280 --> 39:58.680
So that has to be the proud boys yeah yeah because Enrique Tarrio got arrested right before and he's the leader of the proud boys but it what didn't Joe Biggs become the leader of the proud boys?

39:58.680 --> 40:15.240
Yeah but he's a fed yeah this I like this is the way these this is the way these gangs die is whatever former info wars employed Joe Biggs exactly whenever they decide that some of them are working against them and they tear themselves apart that's that's the good news here that's what I'm hearing

40:15.240 --> 40:27.560
Tear each other apart like the wolves and idiots you are yeah yeah the the proud boys acted in ways that are counter to the scam narrative that I need to keep my money coming in so well guess they actually got infiltrated

40:27.560 --> 40:44.440
I just hate how often I said before this all happened guys they're gonna abandon you the moment you do something that they don't like yes they don't have any loyalty to none you can't trust them that's how these things work

40:44.440 --> 41:03.800
yeah and to see the ways that like I mean it's hard to have too much pity for someone like the Q shaman oh yeah the way that community like interacted with him after the fact I tried to say like a lot of suspicions about it like that's so indicative of that they will just you're done

41:03.800 --> 41:13.560
yeah I did everything you guys told me to do I became the hero that you guys needed and now you've abandoned me how could anyone have predicted this yeah yeah

41:13.560 --> 41:31.000
so uh on this episode Alex is really like acting in a lot of ways that I think are bad um because as we discussed earlier like if you take him seriously and you believe the things he's saying you know he's saying that they're gonna kill you yeah they're coming to kill you yeah and he just in your home he keeps banging that drum

41:31.000 --> 41:49.400
they want to rape you in a death camp they want to inoculate you and watch you have a convulsion they want to kill you they love hurting you they're coming they're coming they're coming there's nothing you can do except face reality facing reality is how we beat them we have cancer we have a satanic cancer

41:49.400 --> 42:19.000
hitler was just a beta test you are under attack they're never going to stop they are you are that energy look at them they're race look at schumer look at pelosi they're dead humans they're globalist these are race these are not human they're coming they need your brains they need your soul they don't have it they want to destroy you they want to bring you down they want to annihilate you they love chinese death camps apple loves it they all love it they're all turned over to evil they're under satan's control

42:19.000 --> 42:44.840
i mean and that's why you need to stay at home and write your congressperson non-violence and send letters yeah and just be aware yeah that's why you need to go put up infowars bumper stickers and buy colloidal iodine yeah go fuck yourself man so alex is saying here's what you need when they come to your home knock on your door because they need your brains to kill you well they need your brains

42:44.840 --> 42:55.720
ah i knew you guys were coming and they're like no how and then they leave yeah yeah yep you flash your infowars bumper sticker and it's like garlic to a Dracula

42:59.320 --> 43:05.000
so alex has a has a real interesting relationship with uh the events of the sixth and the storming

43:05.000 --> 43:10.040
and i've noticed a little thing that he's starting to talk about more or starting to bring up and i

43:10.040 --> 43:15.560
think that one of his primary concerns is that they planned it poorly and we just keep putting

43:15.560 --> 43:20.040
up with it and putting up with it you're like well then let's get violent they are controlling

43:20.040 --> 43:26.280
the dumbest violent elements to make sure that it's all coordinated wrong you don't see q saying

43:28.440 --> 43:31.560
go to chucky schumer's house or go to obama's house or where they're at

43:32.280 --> 43:36.280
oh no no no no it's attack the capital right on the right day that's kind of fucked up

43:36.280 --> 43:43.640
yeah i mean he's probably not wrong though but but but like if you planned it better and you succeed

43:43.640 --> 43:50.040
and you fuck everything up then trump takes power says that it's all actually antifa uh gets the

43:50.040 --> 43:55.560
military on his side starts fucking everybody up who isn't a proud boy or whatever um but instead

43:55.560 --> 44:03.240
they did it poorly so here we are maybe i mean it's hard to play what if game right right right

44:03.240 --> 44:08.520
right right but it it shouldn't be that alex is like wow man they planned that shit poorly

44:08.520 --> 44:13.960
well yeah he's supposed to be opposed to all of this right right at least that's what he's trying

44:13.960 --> 44:21.000
to present as much as they got tricked the q anon and antifa did the storm he's supposed to be

44:21.000 --> 44:25.160
against it as a whole he he just wanted to go talk on the other side of the building where he

44:25.160 --> 44:31.560
had a permit oh no if they if they had won he's 100 for it i mean we know that yeah like those

44:31.560 --> 44:36.120
little indications those little moments where he's like it's poorly planned and they didn't go to

44:36.120 --> 44:45.240
soft targets yeah yeah uh okay yeah yeah fucked up yep jesus now you might think let me ask you

44:45.240 --> 44:53.080
a question sure dian if alex jones sees a guy who punches him no wait oh sorry i you didn't finish

44:53.080 --> 44:57.560
it he sees a guy who's got like a really hot wife uh-huh punches him i'm sorry never mind do you

44:57.560 --> 45:05.080
think that he's jealous of that guy um don't absolutely will he say so no well actually he will

45:05.080 --> 45:10.360
by going on a long-winded rant about how he's not because see i can see some dude with this

45:10.360 --> 45:15.160
incredibly gorgeous wife and i'm just like admiring a horse or something and you know

45:15.160 --> 45:19.000
i'm not seeing a man like a horse to him i put the woman down i'm just like that's an incredible

45:19.000 --> 45:24.680
thing wow i'm just glad you're having sex with that at having kids this makes me feel good for

45:24.680 --> 45:31.480
humanity i look at some you know but the average man i've learned just is envious of everything

45:31.480 --> 45:36.120
that's weird that is a weird thing to say yeah that's a weird thing i see someone with a hot

45:36.120 --> 45:42.040
spouse and i'm like i'm so glad you get to fuck that i'm i'm in in my head i was waiting for him

45:42.040 --> 45:47.480
to say something about miscegenation like that's the level of you get fucked up i'm operating that

45:47.480 --> 45:54.600
person's attractive you get to fuck them and have kids jesus i look at that like a horse this is not

45:54.600 --> 46:02.600
just a horse this is not just a very weird way for me to still experience jealousy yeah jesus

46:02.600 --> 46:08.280
anyway well alex has a guest on um this is interesting because this person has basically

46:08.280 --> 46:12.920
been shouting q anon stuff into the wind for weeks yeah uh but alex pretends that's not the case

46:13.480 --> 46:17.800
patrick burn is a really smart fella is he he's written an article we'll put on screen and tell

46:17.800 --> 46:23.640
you about where there's a peaceful way out of this violent stalemate we're in yeah patrick

46:23.640 --> 46:29.080
burn is the former ceo of overstock who's been yelling a bunch of uh q anon nonsense yeah didn't

46:29.080 --> 46:34.120
we hear him say q anon nonsense on the sixth oh yeah yeah um i don't know if it was on the

46:34.120 --> 46:39.720
sixth but yeah he's uh or the the rally before that yeah that one right before that the one

46:39.720 --> 46:45.160
episode where we covered the rallies yeah yeah yeah um so he is uh wants patrick wants to tell

46:45.160 --> 46:51.480
you that if you're violent you're just helping nancy pelosi if our side goes out there and goes

46:51.480 --> 46:57.480
violent what you are doing is a you're losing middle america they will not support you and be

46:57.480 --> 47:02.840
you know 20 of america will support and then the other thing is you're giving nancy pelosi all she

47:02.840 --> 47:09.000
needs to basically she wants to have a a law passed that makes it illegal to be republican

47:09.000 --> 47:14.120
and they're going to do that if you go out and get violent oh yeah this is real persecution

47:14.120 --> 47:18.680
they keep talking like they've talked a bunch on infowars about outlawing the democratic party

47:18.680 --> 47:24.280
what are you doing i don't know yeah we need to literally word for word we need to get rid of the

47:24.280 --> 47:30.040
democratic party and then the republican party can split into two parties one the far right party and

47:30.040 --> 47:36.760
one the right party that's what alex said that a bunch yeah yeah yeah yeah so uh look the important

47:36.760 --> 47:40.360
thing though is that you don't get violent uh well it's probably when we come back because that's

47:40.360 --> 47:45.400
true that's one way to do this and if patriots did that we would defeat pelosi we would defeat

47:45.400 --> 47:50.920
i might we would defeat uh defeat the cfr and hawse because that's the thing we're really

47:50.920 --> 47:55.080
going to do war we should know what real war is like burn everything in your path kill everything

47:55.080 --> 48:00.280
which i'm not calling for not go take selfies in the capital and act like a jackass we don't want

48:00.280 --> 48:06.920
to go to war stay there patrick burn is our guest we don't want to do it but if you raise everything

48:06.920 --> 48:14.280
burn down everything kill everybody we would defeat the globalists i am blinded by the idea

48:14.280 --> 48:20.680
that you could think the guy saying you should toss the geneva conventions uh right back up

48:20.680 --> 48:28.280
your ass and burn everything to the ground along the way uh is the good guy that confuses me dan

48:28.280 --> 48:34.280
well it's because you know he's he's he's he's good the democrats are evil and they're run by

48:34.280 --> 48:40.200
satan and what you need to do is not take the moral high ground no burn everything to the

48:40.200 --> 48:45.720
fucking ground well but but but but to be fair he's not saying that he wants to do that just

48:45.720 --> 48:54.760
that it would work also again it would work again he would defeat the globalists and the cfr and

48:54.760 --> 49:00.120
nancy pelosi all right if these patriots did a sherman's march right and burned down everything

49:00.120 --> 49:05.320
killed everyone around them right but it's antifa who did all the violence blah blah blah blah blah

49:05.320 --> 49:10.360
and the right wingers who weren't there but the ones who may have been there and if they were

49:10.360 --> 49:17.000
they were proud boys who had been uh co-opted by a fed who might be joe biggs you guys gotta work

49:17.000 --> 49:23.400
overtime to say we didn't do exactly what we said and wanted to do it's a little silly yeah so

49:23.400 --> 49:29.400
speaking of silly a lot of people believe it yeah speaking of silly things patrick uh burn he's got

49:29.400 --> 49:35.960
a really simple suggestion for what needs to happen start overstock2.com well here he's gonna

49:35.960 --> 49:43.560
overstock uh ballots okay here's what we're gonna do doesn't quite work we're gonna steal it these

49:43.560 --> 49:48.760
guys that one of the things they always have is like a solution to the problem sure that they see

49:48.760 --> 49:53.640
like in this case they think the election was stolen yeah so they have a solution that's really

49:53.640 --> 50:00.760
really simple but man it is not simple it's insanely complicated and would be outrageous

50:00.760 --> 50:06.440
to actually do but they're like this is all we want it's so simple trump could today president

50:06.440 --> 50:14.680
trump could order those six counties be recount on live stream tv by the national guard we see

50:14.680 --> 50:19.640
what happens if there is no aberration no irregularities he gets on his helicopter no

50:19.640 --> 50:24.920
must have fuss he told me that if on the other hand there's big irregularities then he should

50:24.920 --> 50:30.760
use his executive powers to say you know what this whole election pursuant to that executive

50:30.760 --> 50:37.800
order i told you about if they show what i think that those may show is 500 800 000 irregular votes

50:37.800 --> 50:41.320
in those different counties he then just says look we're going to scrub this it's obviously

50:41.320 --> 50:46.280
so compromised this election is an egg we cannot unscramble i'm going to have the national guard

50:46.280 --> 50:53.480
rerun an election nationally 30 30 days 45 days they're going to run it paper ballots only no

50:53.480 --> 50:58.600
machines if you want to vote absentee somebody comes your door gives you the ballot you fill it

50:58.600 --> 51:05.000
out so everything it'll be the most it'll be the most drum tight secure no nonsense election

51:05.000 --> 51:09.480
america's ever had and you know what huh i wouldn't be surprised if the guy won 120 million

51:09.480 --> 51:13.800
votes you know if i would if they did that so that's what he should do but before taking that

51:13.800 --> 51:18.920
big step he should just send the national guard in to recount the ballots in those six states is

51:18.920 --> 51:25.560
this so much to ask i i i will i say this to you honestly i think the only thing that could get

51:26.200 --> 51:32.520
over 90 of americans to try and overthrow the government is any party saying let's have another

51:32.520 --> 51:37.400
election right now i think everyone is a little burned out everyone would be like i'm fucking

51:37.400 --> 51:44.360
done yeah i'm fucking done capital buildings don't care governor's mansions don't care post offices

51:44.360 --> 51:49.480
don't care not doing another election none of it none of it that will make me want to burn

51:49.480 --> 51:55.400
everything to the ground i i like when people like patrick burn try to play this game because

51:55.400 --> 52:00.600
what they're doing is essentially offering this like false idea of a simple solution it's like

52:00.600 --> 52:05.800
why wouldn't you accept this really simple solution if you just do this then all of our

52:05.800 --> 52:12.280
complaints would go away you're that's obviously not true no and it's a setup it's a trap totally

52:12.280 --> 52:18.920
imagine a scenario where in the world or the united states is like yes okay we will do this

52:18.920 --> 52:24.200
national guard hand count of these ballots what would end up happening is then that would be used

52:24.200 --> 52:30.520
as an opportunity to find a new problem that they can use to complain and then uh try and get this

52:30.520 --> 52:36.040
national election with the national guard or whatever it's all just a fucking stupid game

52:36.040 --> 52:40.600
uh trying to it's a fishing uh adventure that they're trying to go on i find something to

52:40.600 --> 52:45.400
complain about it would be it would be it almost makes me long for the days when they would have

52:45.400 --> 52:49.800
to actually move the goal posts instead of being able to see that they've set up goal posts exactly

52:49.800 --> 52:55.720
20 yards apart for infinity and every time you reach one they're like nah this goal post is fake

52:55.720 --> 53:00.040
we were going for that one over there and you're like no there's an infinity number of goal posts

53:00.040 --> 53:06.600
that's annoying yeah so uh on the 12th trump was speaking in alamo texas which again is not the

53:06.600 --> 53:13.240
alamo which was totally on purpose he chose alamo the city 100 on purpose just because nobody knew

53:13.240 --> 53:17.480
that he was coming doesn't mean that he didn't choose alamo the city 100 on purpose and alex

53:17.480 --> 53:22.040
knows that it's the city not the alamo building you would hope and he has also said that people

53:22.040 --> 53:26.760
are gathering at the alamo so there is some confusion you would think um and i think that

53:26.760 --> 53:31.560
patrick i'm not sure if he knows if it's the alamo or alamo texas i hate these people he's

53:32.760 --> 53:37.000
about to give a speech in an hour well that may be symbolic that he's an alamo

53:38.040 --> 53:43.560
you know you can't he may that is symbolic isn't it it would be yeah he should take and you're down

53:43.560 --> 53:49.080
there by not far from there as i recall yeah my ancestor was there yeah oh was he who was your

53:49.080 --> 53:53.560
ancestor someone just look it up it doesn't really matter oh well it doesn't matter i don't live off

53:53.560 --> 54:00.040
the past laurels just interesting bullshit david crockett okay no not david crockett not david

54:00.040 --> 54:04.440
crockett fuck no not david crockett yeah uh let's play 20 questions with somebody who are at the

54:04.440 --> 54:13.160
alamo more racist i don't i don't go off the past laurels later on he's going to say that uh both

54:13.160 --> 54:17.880
sides of his family were on the mayflower of course why not he talks about all these answers

54:17.880 --> 54:23.800
all the fucking time fuck off why not i love it i was i also think queen i think he's trying to

54:23.800 --> 54:27.800
imply that it's colonel travis but i don't think he's related to colonel travis at all

54:27.800 --> 54:33.640
no anyway we get a revelation about spiritually they're both drunks that's true yeah and uh uh

54:33.640 --> 54:39.480
fumblebums stumblebums that's what i was trying to say i prefer fumblebums um so here's an

54:39.480 --> 54:44.920
uh uh interesting piece of trivia about what's going on in patrick burns life right now i have

54:44.920 --> 54:49.720
covid now by the way just to let you know that's why i'm coughing but i you can't get we're

54:49.720 --> 54:55.800
practicing so you look really healthy the pcr test told you that yeah yesterday you know 96

54:55.800 --> 55:01.640
of those are false it's like a mod no this is real i have a mild flu i feel it well no people

55:01.640 --> 55:06.200
get colds people get flus but they're calling basically the pcr test if you have any viral

55:06.200 --> 55:12.280
background says that you have covered oh really so alex is trying to convince wow he doesn't have

55:12.280 --> 55:18.760
wow jesus did patrick not realize you weren't supposed to actually have covid ever if you were

55:18.760 --> 55:23.880
near alex's show yeah i would imagine that 40 of info warriors have probably had it

55:24.520 --> 55:29.640
i think i mean alex people who work he thinks he had it yeah yeah yeah i think people who work at

55:29.640 --> 55:37.720
infowars have almost uh yeah i bet the number is high yeah so ali alexander um is the the

55:37.720 --> 55:45.240
head of stop the steal he was involved in the uh the rallies on the sixth to some capacity he has

55:45.240 --> 55:50.200
done some live streams where he talked about how he planned uh the events right because he's intifa

55:50.200 --> 55:56.840
to put pressure on the people voting about the electoral college along with uh uh who's a paul

55:56.840 --> 56:04.040
gossar mo brooks and andy briggs uh andy biggs yeah uh three members of congress yeah yeah it's

56:04.040 --> 56:10.200
good to know and uh in the aftermath of everything he has been kicked off all social media and there

56:10.200 --> 56:15.320
have been rumors flying around about him being in hiding yeah and some of that might be a little

56:15.320 --> 56:21.560
bit of a crowdfunding operation well um but the grifter's got a grift buddy they're trying to

56:21.560 --> 56:26.120
play this really interesting line about whether or not he's in hiding sure because they don't want

56:26.120 --> 56:31.080
him to be in hiding because that makes him look like a weakling yeah but they also want him to

56:31.080 --> 56:37.400
be in hiding because that makes everything really scary exactly it's tough yeah i'm not in hiding

56:37.400 --> 56:44.520
but you know for my uh own protection because of the tens of thousands of people that the media has

56:44.520 --> 56:54.200
inspired to issue me death threats and fatwas and and uh you know call for my my uh public execution

56:54.200 --> 57:02.040
um i am at an undisclosed location i've had to travel by unconventional means you're taking a

57:02.040 --> 57:07.640
dirigible horse what are we doing here yeah that would be fun yeah i would i would be i would be

57:07.640 --> 57:12.760
happier if ali alexander did try and overthrow the government but via dirigible yeah that would

57:12.760 --> 57:20.200
be great and when i land i can only take a unicycle i have been banned from normal forms

57:20.200 --> 57:25.800
of transportation the globalists will let me get around but i have to look silly doing it i don't

57:25.800 --> 57:31.240
know why it's just part of their rules i have to put one leg on a skateboard at all times it's

57:31.240 --> 57:37.560
insane it's uh yeah i'm not in hiding but i'm also in an undisclosed location and i have to travel

57:37.560 --> 57:44.760
via unconventional beings oh god fuck this oh my god anyway ali uh has his own sort of narrative

57:44.760 --> 57:49.800
about what happened at the capitol and it's pretty similar to alex i guess i believe that forces

57:49.800 --> 57:54.840
within our government coordinated with the paramilitary arm of the democrat party to have

57:54.840 --> 57:59.960
that one uh disgusting events inside the u.s capital and not everybody was discussing who

57:59.960 --> 58:04.520
entered the u.s capital i want to be very clear okay no the vast majority stayed within the

58:04.520 --> 58:12.040
velvet ropes okay and this is what i like to tell people is if the mob was coming to perform

58:12.040 --> 58:18.120
an insurrection then they would have breached the u.s house floor what we know is that only

58:18.120 --> 58:24.040
jake that weird q shaman and who by the way a lot of people don't know this here's an exclusive

58:24.040 --> 58:31.880
jake actually protested counter protested the last stop the steel rally in arizona so jake actually

58:32.600 --> 58:38.200
has attacked stop the steel in arizona he's probably antifa he's probably antifa i looked

58:38.200 --> 58:42.840
into this and apparently what happened is that the q shaman showed up at ali alexander's event

58:42.840 --> 58:46.760
the stop the steel event and wanted to give a speech and he wouldn't let him yep they got

58:46.760 --> 58:51.640
into a fight so okay all right it wasn't so much counter protesting it was that uh

58:51.640 --> 58:57.640
uh yeah he didn't get a speaker slot he was not happy about it i propose a new solution to our

58:57.640 --> 59:03.960
problems all right here's my here's my pitch i'm listening okay all of these grifter types

59:03.960 --> 59:11.400
are scrambling to scapegoat which i like how it's 2020 yeah or 2021 yeah blackjack

59:11.400 --> 59:17.880
maybe it is gonna stay i don't think it's it's too late now it's already happened

59:17.880 --> 59:26.440
uh no okay they're scapegoating people all right gotta do it uh even though they love them uh and

59:26.440 --> 59:34.120
they support everything that they did i propose the thunderdome all right alex jones has to go

59:34.120 --> 59:39.560
up against the q shaman thunderdome two men enter one man leave ali are you talking about the uh

59:39.560 --> 59:46.680
the place where they now have wwe raw absolutely the thunderdome two people enter one leaves until

59:46.680 --> 59:52.920
we have a single ideological group it i mean i i think that might pull some better ratings than

59:52.920 --> 59:58.840
alex's normal show that'd be great i'd watch that uh the paramilitary wing of the democratic party

59:58.840 --> 01:00:03.640
it's just say that one more time that's just cute i'm sorry that's just uh antifa yeah that's all

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:07.160
he's saying yeah anyway fuck ali alexander he doesn't have anything interesting to say

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:12.120
it's a really short interview because alex has another guest and this guy's uncle wrote the

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:17.000
foreword for a very racist book written by gary allen about the civil rights movement great joel

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.960
scousin is back he has some interesting questions to ask about uh hey we're supposed to admire

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:27.560
general flinn right and you know alex did that interview with flinn right and in that interview

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:34.200
general flinn said 100 trump is still going to be president after january 20th correct and scousins

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:40.360
like how could he be so stupid how can he believe something how could he but i'm convinced that

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:46.280
there's somebody else who perhaps general flinn recognizes him in former days uh in the military

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:51.320
as well as general mackinary who's who's talking to them and telling them that i'm a patriot you

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:55.800
know there's a whole group in the white house or in the intelligence and military services that

01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:00.120
are going to defend donald trump and put him back in the white house there's no other explanation

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:05.640
for why general flinn in the face of all that we know about the deep state would make a statement

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.920
that there's a hundred percent chance that donald trump's going to win this and he's got another

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:14.280
explanation oh that already it's um it's even worse i can tell you last thursday when trump

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:18.680
made that speech flinn broke with him and i'm gonna leave it at that but flinn is not buying

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:25.240
that kool-aid now yeah i wish you'd ask him if you have contact with who was the contact who told him

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:31.320
uh because that had to be somebody just give you out of the show his number yeah i'd appreciate

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:36.760
that that seems rude i would appreciate that as well that seems rude i am going to sleep better

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:42.760
tonight knowing that general flinn is being bothered by the nephew of w cleon scousin yeah

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:48.200
and ignoring his texts he will make me feel very good uh it's it's nice to know that general flinn

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:52.360
is soon gonna have to get a new phone number because scousin won't stop bother yeah exactly

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:58.200
that's what i wanted yeah that's what i want out of this whole thing yeah so uh epstein jeffrey

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:03.800
sure let's bring him back does everybody realize that they just tried to storm the fucking capital

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:11.400
he's dead right i guess i guess that's what drives the deep state the promise that we

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.960
will make all of your sins go away you won't be prosecuted unless you do something stupid

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:22.040
that we can't cover up like jeffrey epstein but even then they may have uh you know exited him

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:27.800
there was this uh eyewitness sighting at the new mexico ranch that sure he's probably alive

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:33.960
you know you can't put anything past these deep state people so i guess they both are suspicious

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:40.360
that uh epstein's still alive which is yeah great whatever all right anyway man so there was a video

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:46.680
that was going around on on twitter i believe that this is what alex is talking about um someone

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.760
brought it to my attention a couple people actually and it was a video of alex yelling

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:57.160
about like fuck trump you know yeah yeah all of this i didn't see it it was supposedly like after

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:03.880
all of this like trump conceding and being weak alex has turned on him sure and it was the videos

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:09.080
from when alex uh got mad at trump for bombing syria right right shoving isis up his dirty

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:13.720
asshole it was that same day um but it was the video of him like when he didn't realize the

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:18.840
feeds were live okay and he was yelling like fuck this shit i'm not in a fucking cult yeah you know

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:23.400
like all this yeah and people people like lied about it saying it was implying that it was

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:28.680
current sure alex thinks it might be a deep fake the interest of truth because i'm trying to scan

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:32.280
my mind i want to get into trump and the world and martial law and all the rest of it i'm a sinner

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:38.440
i've been through a lot of stress in 27 years on air probably 10 times i flipped out late at night

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:43.720
when i was drinking or i was angry one night my dog died it had an aneurysm spring out of its

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:48.280
face i came up here after it died i blew up on air and cussed and yelled but but there's nothing

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:52.520
modern i haven't done that in a long time so that's out there i repent nobody's perfect except

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:57.640
jesus christ uh but no i've not done anything in a long time like that that sounds like a deep fake

01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:02.120
or edits of something i've done together that are exaggerated it might be a deep fake yeah that

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:07.080
sounds right that sounds right it's probably a deep thing yeah video of me screaming obscenity

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:13.960
about trump is that is that the only difference between the right wing and like uh other people

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:20.760
is just like other people are like hey i suppose i could be wrong about something not deep fake

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:25.880
yeah the right is just like i'm gonna have to go with i'm still right no matter what

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:31.560
yeah so scousin his uh interview is not really all that interesting either he's sort of going

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:36.920
on the same uh tracks that we've already seen not really bringing a whole lot more to the

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:41.480
the conversation outside of wanting flin's number sure and revealing that epstein's probably alive

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:50.520
still um so alex has something to say about presidencies this might be the last one everybody's

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:55.720
getting ready for the president he's not perfect but he's our president he's an american probably

01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:01.800
the last president you'll see before the return of christ because god gives you an example of what

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:07.720
to do right before the fall like this is what you could have had so alex is uh doing the fourth hour

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:15.240
now because trump's gonna give his speech in alamo sure and alex is constantly going on and on about

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:22.600
how like no one else is broadcasting this speech jesus it's it's very annoying yeah um but after

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:27.000
the speech he gets into like this really fucked up headspace where he's just talking about how like

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:33.800
i've lived in the fire except it's not the fire all right it's the bacon grease okay

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:39.240
people are like jones are you scared uh the opposite i've been in the bacon grease for a

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:49.400
long time i've been lowered down in it my whole life man i've been waiting for this moment all

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:56.840
my life because i believe when i warn you when you get lowered down into that grease and your

01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:03.800
grease and your toes hit that boiling pain and then it's up your shins and up to your legs and

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:11.400
up to your waist and up your chest and up your neck that you're gonna fight back i'm betting on

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:21.000
you i've lived in the grease for decades psychically i would say physically that's uh

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.480
my bed is made of grease that's a that's a weird mental image yeah i don't even see melted grease

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:31.880
either i see the like solid stuff if you leave it out for a day and it's sitting there it's

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:36.280
just sitting in there just like oh this is actually kind of comfortable it's basically

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:42.120
like a sensory deprivation tank it's like a jello bath yeah joe rogan got me on this it's a sensory

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:49.480
deprivation grease yeah i love the grease i go to a spa once every two weeks so alex fakes crying

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:53.880
uh also at the end of this episode which is a little fun yeah nothing will fulfill you like

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:58.840
the holy ghost the holy ghost will fulfill you so much you can't even believe it

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:08.280
but god demands you take action against evil which seems scary which i don't know why i've

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:15.960
been in this so long fighting evil is a pleasure it is an enjoyment it is the the question is why

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:21.080
do i do this more why was i not doing it before there's actually a great feeling of guilt and

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:27.960
patheticness in the face of god once you join god satan is a rotting dead carcass in the corner and

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:33.000
with maggots covering it and you're like looking at celestial galaxies and unending power and

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.320
you're like how did this ever what how is this and then you watch civilization falling and your

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:56.040
people falling that's the sick joke to replace trump sure with pike to replace your mother with

01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:02.760
satan to replace everything that's strong and everything that's good with a lie why would you

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.600
do that all right alex i'm gonna need you to do this again from the top yeah yeah we're gonna

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:10.440
yeah we're gonna need to do another thread we're gonna need to do another take on this one alex

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.360
great trump with biden great great your mother with satan what are we having for dinner tonight

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:28.120
i want to wait i can't wait for the inauguration because i want to see if alex thinks that joe

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:35.000
biden's uh plumping up 10 bags of blood got 10 bags of blood in him he's pumping he's plumping

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.000
i do i do love the idea that you can you can reach enlightenment like you know you think of the the

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.160
great uh the great buddhas and how they they managed to pierce the veil and detach themselves

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:51.800
by seeing the ultimate meaninglessness of our space in the universe but if instead of like

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:59.000
being like oh i've reached enlightenment they were just like i hate biden that would be that

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.400
would be something yeah that would be interesting so now we get to the 13th um and uh alex is in a

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:13.160
different head space um he feels doomed a little bit uh turns out uh you ever see the children of

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:17.080
men that movie i have a lot of people talking about it right now i think alex might have seen

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:21.480
it yeah can we put the headline up for live show today please from mfo wars.com every day we have

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:27.400
a posting with a live audio video feed in it and it says right there we are now in the new world

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:34.600
order tune into this emergency broadcast if you want to live because when you look at people

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:41.960
and when you see children that are two or three years old today they're growing up in a dystopia

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:47.640
and it's going to accelerate very very quickly and that's the last generation that'll even be

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:52.840
able to have children and most of them won't be able to and most the children you see today will

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:57.960
be dead by the time they're 20 years old of cancers and other things implanted in them and

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:03.880
you'll just you'll be told oh something else caused it but it's it's it's the vaccines you're

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:09.960
all being killed we're all dying so i want all the fbi agents to know i want all the bureaucrats

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:13.960
knowing liberals to know conservatives to know everybody thinks you're part of the system you're

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:21.160
not part of the system i can tell you the people running this are not in control then are they

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:28.200
running it now they've been given advanced knowledge okay interdimensionally that's how

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:34.840
they get oh shit but it's it's aliens yeah it's the aliens it's the devil it's the devil alien

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:43.720
okay uh-huh so hmm interdimension yep yeah interdimensional demon devils trying to give

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:50.280
you vaccines in order to kill you but please don't storm the capital i am almost 100% positive

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:57.160
whatever you do just spread links to my content i'm just so sure that uh there's a promise that

01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:04.040
you at least won't be fucked over by the devil in hell until after you die nah he's he's he's

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:09.720
poking you here i don't i just don't think fork the pitchfork is actually three vaccines also

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:17.480
i i just oh man this is a trident it works for prongs right so so silly whenever they take a

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:22.200
stupid religion and they're like no no let's add some science to it now that we know about

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:28.840
different dimensions yeah yeah god was actually in a higher plane man which which lowers everything

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:33.560
down from like a spiritual thing to just another fucking i think it takes a lot of value away from

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:38.760
yeah it's like oh you know i understand that lightning is static electricity as the you know

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:44.440
and it's like oh well i guess that's not as magical as if zeus was throwing it at me now i

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:50.200
know god's just some asshole in a different dimension fuck that guy yeah and live in my

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:55.080
dimension if you want to tell me what to do and it does introduce the uh you know sort of the point

01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:01.240
that like once you realize that lightning isn't thrown by zeus and it is this electrical thing

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:06.440
you can then create lightning yeah you can understand it yeah and you know it kind of

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:11.800
takes away the point of religion if you bring all this science stuff to it because then it's within

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:17.000
the realm of human comprehension yeah and then it's not really religion at all yeah you see

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.680
through a glass darkly oh shit you guys found out about science i'm fucked so anyway it's the

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:28.520
extra dimensional devil that is interesting we could if it is extra dimensional then that would

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:33.960
suggest that there is a possibility that we could eventually pierce our way through into god's

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:39.400
dimension and finally kill and overthrow god like we've always been dreaming or conversely

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:44.360
alex does have an actual shot of destroying the death that's true yeah he's got an outside chance

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:51.560
it sounds silly to us but if you actually believe this stuff it's there yeah it's a long shot it's a

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:58.200
long shot right so anyway the devil's behind everything i give him 20 to 1 odds ah that's

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:03.800
generous we can look at all this news and all the things that are happening all the insanity

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:11.400
and we can say to ourselves well this is this is man-made but it's not we have a fallen nature

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:15.800
but we are being manipulated and the bible tells us that interdimensionally

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:23.400
a creature that is out of the light spectrum vision that we can see oh what now

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:31.240
fell to this planet and has a plan to overtake us play god and then use us and our creativity

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:37.960
to build an escape system for it off of the planet what that's how advanced we are we are

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:45.480
way more advanced than than than than the species the creature that turned against god what now

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:51.240
that's the bible folks secret societies and the churches and the masons and all of that is to

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.040
keep you from that information the churches are trying to keep this from you

01:13:54.040 --> 01:14:00.360
i love that i want to end every insane things every insane thing i say with just now now that's

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:07.480
the bible that's the bible nailed it guys yeah put that one in the books yeah it would be it

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.800
would be really interesting if like all the stories about alex that uh end up getting

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:17.400
printed in these you know these outlets like they led with alex who believes he's fighting

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:24.040
an ex-dimensional demon yeah yeah yeah fuck you how dare you pretend that any of these people have

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:30.440
anything other than believes nonsense before their name alex jones who believes that communism is

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:36.120
being directed by a literal demon totally totally kind of would take some of the uh the sting away

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:41.720
from him make them the big bad whenever you're like oh that oh so um in the future

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:46.360
sick people will be forced to merge with machines that sounds right but they'll actually be killed

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:51.640
but what you will have to pretend that they haven't been killed and these machines are

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:56.360
actually them or else you'll get in trouble i mean we're off the edge of the cliff we're in

01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:02.360
the new world order now but if you don't understand that at the end of this everybody dies

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:08.760
and there's no more children you're going to die you're going to die you're going to die

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:15.080
and there's no more children and in the process of wanting to live through the social credit score

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:21.880
they tighten the noose down they tighten the vice down until you are involved in public rituals

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:29.160
of sterilizing your children sterilizing yourself resisting god resenting god and turning over your

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:33.880
humanity because you're so sick you've got to merge the machines so you just believe you have

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:40.200
a chance to still live though you will actually die but there will be a law that you cannot call

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:48.040
the synthetics that are human machine merged cyborgs dead if you say that's not a person

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:52.520
anymore they didn't they didn't transfer over to the machine it's a fraud well i mean honestly

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:57.320
that's right mimicking them that will be punishable by death i don't know if i would go that far

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:04.840
i have the entire enemy blueprint all right now that's the bible and and now i've studied this so

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:09.240
much and now we've gone so far and i and i've been i've experienced things at different levels

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:13.880
so where now anybody can go read what the globalists say what they do and know what

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:18.600
they're going to carry out but now from my immersion in this since about seven years old

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:26.040
i can use the analogy see the code of the matrix and so let me just great analogy for sure not

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:33.160
sure not in an sg that's only going to get worse from here this is a lunatic yeah full stop yep

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:40.040
the end yeah period so anyway uh this lunatic here uh he wants to uh it seems like he wants to

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:45.960
distance himself from trump a little bit oh i can't imagine why and uh this was one of the uh the

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:53.240
first indications of like it didn't work out you know whatever and so i just want to tell liberals

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:58.600
conservatives all of you look i know what happened with trump wishful thinking happened so i'm going

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.200
to tell you what really went down with trump we come back i've thought about this i prayed about

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:10.360
this and i'll explain when we come back but just listen to me listen to me the new world order is

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:16.680
here tune in to this emergency broadcast if you want to live that's not a joke because the god of

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:24.280
this world loves death sure loves death yeah why not so yeah trump was wishful thinking

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:33.720
yeah what did he just start listening to our show he must have yeah because i

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:41.480
did he start in the back catalog where i was like in 2017 guys trump is going to abandon you

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:47.160
the moment that it's an expedient for him to fucking do so yeah this is all nonsense you're

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:51.000
building up something that's going to eventually blow up in your face he's not the guy you're

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.920
saying he is he's a giant coward who's a front man for consortiums on the god damn he's cold yeah

01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:02.440
yeah so apparently also i know that i think you and i have heard um alex say that trump is one

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:08.520
of the greatest christians uh ever uh he's very religious he's deeply religious he held up that

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:13.800
bible one time and you see him praying with like uh paula white cain and all these types that's

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:17.800
right that's right praying to money i believe that's what paula white cain prays to right well

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:21.960
it turns out that trump actually isn't christian oh that's not a surprise he's more of an energy

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:29.960
guy great trump thought he could go in there and defeat these people and he's never been a devil

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:36.200
worshiper but he did whatever was popular but as he felt the real he said he was uh undercover

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:42.200
as a christian and he felt the energy of god and christ empowering him and got into that energy in

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:47.000
that mission because trump's an energy guy you said he was a secret religions and names and this

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.080
or that we've had conversations about the energy loves energy you said he's been a christian since

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:57.560
like 40 years the enemy let trump get in he did win by a landslide the first time in the second

01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:03.560
time they let him get in to energize the left and then have people reject control borders reject law

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:11.800
and order reject populism reject jobs reject a optimistic future and to say no we want a evil

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:21.160
pedophile communist chinese zombie so trump is a false flag i am tired dan tired wait i'm so tired

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:26.120
i know that this is exhausting and it's so stupid but trust me the end of this episode is going to

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:31.560
be so worth it all right um yeah but i don't know i i know that he's implying kind of that like

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:36.920
trump is a false flag which is weird because analyze the last years of your career then buddy

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:43.400
boy yeah um yeah but the way alex is trying to sum it up here on this episode is like hey me a culpa

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:49.480
i put too much faith in the guy you know hey what do you know i got too optimistic and i should

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:53.800
teach and i should cover the globalist different angles of it of philosophy and and like i said

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.600
break the left-right paradigm because the republicans and democrats are part of the same

01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:02.280
system you see that again right now trump was a populist movement it was powerful but i put too

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:08.200
much hope in it you did as well go fuck yourself you don't get to do like this is the one time that

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:14.040
i want as much as possible all of us to come together and this is something that i feel like

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:20.360
the right should get on board with these guys just don't get to do this no they you can pick new

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:25.640
propagandists but alex doesn't get to go back well and also it would be good for there to be a real

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:31.800
moment of reflection for people who are serious and not total assholes who just happen to have

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:37.160
more conservative ideas about the way a state should maybe be organized take a moment to

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:43.640
reflect on how what these people have done to your party now we're at a point where most

01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:50.360
right-thinking people will not like even engage with conservative ideas because these people have

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:57.960
taken over uh the the premise of your party all right uh so it's january 21st uh it's a good time

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:04.200
for us to start getting to work on the new agenda and now we're going to talk with uh mo brooks who

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:10.840
just two weeks ago helped to orchestrate a fucking coup about tax proposals yeah we're talking now

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:15.720
we're gonna talk tax proposals with a guy who's friends with ali alexander yeah no fuck that yeah

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:20.920
why in god's name would i talk about any policy issue with you if i know your secret plan is

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:27.160
overthrow the god damn government yeah and and it's not fair uh for alex to pretend that it's

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:31.400
just like yeah we got too excited about this like no that's you don't get to do that no it's

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:37.240
personally mean to me yeah but i think that he's struggling with this too um and i i got a little

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:42.840
bit of a feeling of some alex trying to express something that he's not willing to express in

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:48.120
this next clip and granted i might be psychoanalyzing too much but no real satanism

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:52.760
about pushing past boundaries and doing really really destructive hateful things of hurting

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:59.240
people and not caring and being a predator which you are and not in a respectful way like you kill

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:04.600
a deer and then harvest it for the food no no you're you're killing people's dreams you're

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:10.120
you're stealing people's destinies you're hurting the loving energy on this planet you're not good

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:16.200
people you're failures and it's why you're all so scrawny and ugly and sick because you're losers

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:21.240
that the satanic system crushed and now you've gone to the thing that abused you hoping you could

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:25.960
get power by the thing that abused you when all it will do is continue to destroy you

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:34.360
you people are seeking after power you will get so much power from the holy ghost that you will

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:39.720
be ashamed of yourself and what you were and you will not even know how to deal with it because god

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:45.160
is infinitely greater than that so i think if you pay close attention to the words that alex is

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:49.960
saying there i think you can hear that as him ranting about himself yeah he's saying that these

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:54.360
satanic losers he's yelling about are so pathetic because they were crushed by a system and in

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:58.520
response they're buddying up to the very system that crushed them in hopes of getting power from

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:03.720
it he then says god will give you unspeakable power alex has been pretty clear in the past

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:08.440
about how much suffering supporting trump has brought into his life from the financial hardships

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:12.680
to the lawsuits he's in way more trouble than he was before he decided to take on trump as his

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:18.600
divine champion that could easily be understood as alex being crushed by a system in response he's

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:23.240
clung on for dear life hoping that system that had crushed him would give him some power in the end

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:28.440
which now is becoming painfully clear is not the case but there's a different more important level

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:33.320
to this shit that i don't think alex even understands as he's talking in this very episode

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:37.880
it's super clear that alex is working through some buyer's remorse on trump and having to admit to

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:43.160
his audience that he got too optimistic about trump as president but this is not the same thing

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:47.400
as like you or me being slightly disillusioned with some of the policy objectives that weren't

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:52.120
achieved under obama yeah this isn't a situation where alex just liked trump and he wasn't as good

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:57.960
as he hoped alex routinely said that trump was a leader anointed by god god had told alex that

01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:02.840
trump was the way to go for alex to now get soft on trump is an admission that he was either making

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:08.360
all that shit up or he's actually soft on god alex doesn't mean any of the things he says the

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:12.440
constant talk about god being on his side and his enemies being controlled by the devil they don't

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:17.320
mean anything it's all just extremist talk to make the difference between his side and the other side

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:22.520
seem impossible to ever reconcile i get the sense that alex is beginning to recognize that trump

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:27.480
himself is a dead end and the price of continuing to believe that he's a god-ordained ruler despite

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:31.960
the fact that biden is president will believe that he's required to do things like storm the capital

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:36.360
yeah and he doesn't want to do that because then there's no money anymore exactly yeah it and this

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:42.120
is just like i i wish i wish that people could see that more clearly yeah any audience member of alex

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:47.240
is that thinks that he has some kind of an actual connection to the religious ideas that he presents

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:52.600
like you got to get over that it's nonsense totally i just heard him say you're killing

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:57.160
people's dreams and then i was like immediately cut to owen schroyer trying to get a job in media

01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:08.120
in five years there's only one infowars person that i've seen actually uh make the leap i think

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:15.160
so there's a guy mchale thalen who uh who writes uh for some i can't remember what outlet he writes

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:22.200
for but i've seen uh the bylines for mchale thalen uh being put around by people who don't realize he

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:27.240
used to work it in for a while yeah yeah so he might uh have a little bit less of the stink did

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:36.360
he do the the politico thing today i'm not sure um but yeah everyone else dreams crushed so brutal

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:40.680
there's news coming out here on the 13th and conversations starting to happen about this

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:46.920
uh this idea uh that was put up by representative mickey cheryl about the uh the possibility that

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:52.280
there was a recon tour yeah the day before that some members of congress were were leading and

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:58.360
this is really fucked up for alex so he's just going to decide it's not real oh you can be a

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:03.640
former u.s attorney that's now a congresswoman who put out a big fake article that that that

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:09.560
that congressman had ali alexander in the capital and they were casing it out the day before and she

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:16.280
saw them and she wants them all arrested because he was he was reconning it she knows that's all a

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:22.760
lot so she said that congress members she saw some congress members giving tours of the capitol

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:27.800
building to people on january 5th the day before the storming yeah this is suspicious to her because

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.960
there were no official tours being done at the moment because of covet 19 so it seemed weird for

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:36.520
these people to be inside the capitol it all would be weird as of the time of this recording cheryl

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:40.520
has joined more than 30 house members calling for an investigation into the people who are there the

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:45.000
day prior and if that proceeds we'll know a lot more as it stands right now if what she's

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:50.280
suggesting is true things may be way more fucked up than they appear yeah but i do want to call out

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:55.480
what is a bit of misinformation that i think alex is combining with this and that is that there was

01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:01.160
a particular video that was floating around that shows ali alexander alex and nick fuentes in what

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:05.480
appears to be the capitol building people have claimed that this video was from the day before

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:10.280
the storming but i've actually found that footage posted as early as november and it's from when

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:15.320
the three of them were in the georgia capitol building uh for that stop the steal event sure

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:19.240
you know they're talking about like if you let the hillbillies decide we'll lose the country that

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:23.480
yeah you can find corroborating videos from that day where they're all in the same uniform or same

01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:28.360
outfits right so i think that what's going on is that video was making the rounds and alex is

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:33.960
responding to that as being what uh representative cheryl was talking about right and i don't know if

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:43.160
that's fair yeah i think we're in a the hard the hard part of the situation is that after the sixth

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:51.400
i just you can't put anything beyond reason you know like if you told me like one of the

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:59.400
representatives had a gun pointed to uh aoc's face i would be like that might be true i can't

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:04.040
rule that out anymore i understand you know i understand that but it's it's critically important

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:09.400
to not descend into the the realm of believing stuff that's too convenient and that you just

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:15.000
want to 100 that's that's what i'm that's what i'm saying is yeah unfortunately now you know

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.400
a lot of that stuff you know you could have just been like okay i don't have the bandwidth to

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:24.680
investigate this there's no way that the representative held a gun directly to her face

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:31.000
and now it's like if if i see that i have to go investigate to make sure because it really could

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:37.640
be true which is terrifying but at the same time i you can't believe that right you know well it's

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:44.040
tough yeah but i think that's also more like it's the burden of the modern information space yeah

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:49.800
and how you can exist in it as a responsible uh consumer of information yeah it's tough it does

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:56.760
suck but it is no it's enough to drive anywhere between uh 30 and 45 percent of the population

01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:05.000
insane yep everybody should not be using social media yep anyway uh nancy pelosi uh had uh had

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.760
some comments about people taking a statue down while back she said something to the effect of

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:16.040
people are gonna do what they're gonna do right and uh alex decides to play this clip and then

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:20.120
talk about killing her but hey are you going to stop the burning and the fires the killing

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.240
well people are going to do what people are going to do in fact let's play that first

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:27.160
the tucker carlson clip but here's here's pelosi people are going to do what people are going to

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:32.200
do here it is respectfully shouldn't that be done by a commission or the city council not a mob in

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:37.560
the middle of the night throwing it into the harbor do what they do it it's a it is uh i do

01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:44.600
think that from a safety standpoint uh it would be a good idea to uh have it taken down if the

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:50.920
community killed him i don't know that it has to be a commission uh but it just could be a community

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:57.160
so if somebody walked up pelosi god forbid it turned into a martyr seriously and stabbed her

01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:02.360
in the neck would that just oh people would put on a tombstone people do what they do no lady

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:06.920
that's not how it works stop assaulting us trying to get us to attack you so you play the victim

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:12.040
you hunchback devil-worshipping witch who will burn in hell god has got you in his process not

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:17.560
us vengeance is mine sayeth the lord i'm gonna play the stucker carlson clip on the uganda

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:25.000
hypocrisy but first i've got products you need amazing x2 back in stock 50 off it's about to

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:30.040
go up so we're selling out of it nailed it hit me um that's like james brown with the sting

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:35.720
hit me so alex uh whenever he says like vengeance is the lord's like we've heard him talk multiple

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:40.200
times about how the riddle of that is that sometimes you need to be god's vengeance

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:47.320
you are god's been i mean if you feel like god is speaking to you sometimes that's what alex is

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:51.800
expressing when he says that vengeance is the lord's that's not what he's saying that's

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:58.600
literally what he's saying but the intent behind it what that what that expression conveys to the

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:07.160
initiated within the infowars uh uh uh information space it means someone stab uh someone might need

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:15.960
to stab nancy pelosi yeah it's fucked up it is a interesting uh like flaw in the legal system is

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:23.000
that because of the way these people speak you can't you can't just like enter oh see alex said

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.680
uh vengeance is mine sayeth the lord so that was a death threat you know you have to be like okay

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:34.840
listen to 300 hours no but i honestly don't think it would be that difficult to say like okay you're

01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:40.360
saying vengeance is the lord's and the lord has nancy pelosi and the crosshairs uh it's gonna get

01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:46.040
stabbed in the neck or whatever and then uh multiple times frequently you've discussed how

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:50.440
the idea that vengeance is the lord's is a riddle right and that actually what it's talking about

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:54.520
is sometimes humans have to step up and be the instruments of god's vengeance right would you

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:58.840
like to uh have a conversation about that i think you could introduce that in court and uh it would

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:03.640
look pretty bad i wouldn't look good i don't know if it's legally actionable but he's a real asshole

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:10.440
speaking of assholes we get another guest now okay and it's a baby reporter oh no junior reporter and

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:16.440
i by junior i mean a baby in an oversized trench coat and a silly hat oh yeah patrick howley comes

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:23.000
on he likes the uh the storming of the capital of course he he hasn't gotten the memo there's a lot

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.480
to be optimistic about because america first is ascendant i think all over the world people are

01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:32.200
beginning to realize that our political system here in the united states is absolutely broken

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:36.440
and i know that you're not a big fan of the protest i think some funny things happen for

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:41.800
instance somebody defecated on chuck schumer's desk and that puts a smile on my face i like

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:46.840
hearing that i like seeing that headline i think that's a a small win for humanity when somebody

01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:51.880
does that you're not supposed to think that though patrick you're supposed to think it's antifa yeah

01:32:52.840 --> 01:33:00.760
i kind of think it's funny so patrick is like he doesn't get the script he doesn't get how we can

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:08.440
make this profitable yeah because he's super into it and he's like this is a good thing you know

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:13.080
i'll say this when the viking shaman and these people were presiding over congress there were

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:18.920
no foreign wars okay we weren't giving any of our taxpayer dollars to pakistan for gender studies

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:23.400
so i was getting calls from all over the world including france and italy in the populist

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:30.600
movement and people were inspired by this so yes it seems to have gone disastrously and i wasn't

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:35.400
there and you know it didn't seem like there was any plan or any rhyme or reason to it and

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:40.920
obviously there were agitators in the crowd but i think just the act of civil disobedience puts the

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:45.880
message out there that americans are at odds with their government and that's a powerful yes our

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:51.960
founders dumped millions of dollars of equivalent of tea in the ocean against attacks i get it okay

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:57.560
what i'm saying to you is if we're gonna launch a war it should be done differently and we played

01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:01.640
right in their hands and i don't want violence this weekend the globalist heather provocateurs

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:07.640
everywhere trying to get violence that's all i'm saying so basically alex is saying to patrick if we

01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:14.200
endorse this we won't get our good war no but there's that but that's that's almost like an

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:19.640
abstract yeah yeah sure sure sure if we endorse people standing up and storming the capital as

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:25.000
like we're at odds with the government whatever other anti-government violence that ends up

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.760
happening is going to be seen as something that we're encouraging and i can't make money on that

01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:37.720
yeah i will get i will end up arrested if we end up to uh being seen as the i don't know the

01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:44.280
mouthpiece the media of uh an insurgent network yeah we can't do that we have to play it smoother

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:52.440
patrick you just be reporter grow up you but at the same time alex said we played right into their

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:59.400
plan you know like okay so yes and so now they got false flagged that antifa with the instigators

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:06.200
sure but that still means that all of those people did it and wanted to do it you wouldn't have been

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:11.080
they they got tricked by the neuro-linguistic programming on the bullhorn i'm so tired yeah

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:17.960
and uh the person who took a shit on schumer's desk was probably q person and you know all the

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.240
stuff that happened yeah like the people who were trump people were just the ones who were

01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:26.280
milling around and taking selfies and stuff sure they were all good people all the things that you

01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:31.640
would be horrified by those were provocateurs you could absolutely stand around and take pictures

01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:38.920
outside of the capitol building good if you storm it that's interesting yeah so we now get to the

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:46.520
point that i've been waiting for since the day that it all went down oh shit oh shit i know who's

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:52.600
coming i know who's coming now i got dr steve pacenik and he was a psychiatrist and worked at

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:57.240
the state department psychological warfare and helped found delta force and he co-wrote the books

01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:02.600
with tom clancy i mean he he's a real spook spook uh compared to all the armchair quarterbacks that

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:07.720
never actually done anything this is amazing all right this is one of my favorite dr steve pacenic

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:16.520
appearances okay this is psychic trauma okay for alex okay this does not go well okay there's a lot

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:21.080
of big swings on steve's part that's what i was looking for and then there's also a lot of steve

01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:27.560
trying to hold a mirror up to alex okay not liking the mirror not liking the mirror so he really

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:32.200
doesn't like the mirror yeah but before he introduces steve he's really gotta like okay i

01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:37.960
know that he said the the election was a sting operation sure i can't really still believe that

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:42.040
one's a little late but it was just a prediction sure he wasn't saying that he was involved in that

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:47.640
he literally said he well and i like steve he's been on the show like 19 years he was trying to

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:52.040
be optimistic you know i think that's why he did it saying hey there was some water murky of

01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:55.160
ballots i don't think it was done system-wide this election that was done with the states

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:59.400
democrats put out their own fake ballots but he made that prediction that you know trump will be

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:03.720
able to turn this around uh now a lot of things have gone sideways i want to get his take on that

01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:10.120
so let's get his take on that i am excited are you ready i am excited i am looking i have been

01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:15.960
looking forward to the biggest swing and that's gotta come from stevie pease right okay nobody

01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:21.720
else can swing like him also please keep in mind that alex has been going on the war path against

01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:30.920
q 100 now steve casey at the bat might be really just sounding like you an object we are now

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:38.440
officially in a military coup what has happened and why i was part of it is because i've had a

01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:45.160
history of doing soft foods in the united states and what we call hard coups overseas overthrowing

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:51.320
regimes using the military in this case we had what we call a hard coup it was initiated as i

01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:57.640
said a month and a half ago two months ago by our cyber command using special forces they were over

01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:04.200
400 people from all parts of the intelligence community i won't go into the names but in effect

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:12.280
now we are about to arrest elosey we're going to arrest biden hunter biden mitt romney oh yeah

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:17.080
those arrests are coming coming right around the corner but you know that's q stuff like these

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:21.640
arrests are about to happen it's been going on forever going on for years but steve he's not

01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:26.120
one of these guys who's just like this stuff is gonna happen stuff has already happened and you

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:32.440
might be shocked to hear about it we have already arrested and basically overseas we have taken out

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:38.200
the pope whom i've identified for over 30 years as a terrorist steve has arrested the pope

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:44.360
pope francis first of his name

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:51.080
so steve arrested the pope okay this is the pope has been arrested this is the thing that's going

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:57.080
around in q anon stuff this is this is a q anon conspiracy theory um and so it's so funny when

01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:03.640
the pope tries to do like very slow incrementally good changes and everybody's like we gotta kill

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:08.120
him we just gotta arrest him we gotta throw him into prison forever we're gonna get an update

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:13.320
on the pope a little bit later steve has more details okay it might be even less believable okay

01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:21.400
then we've arrested the pope but how i don't know he's his own country so alex believes that on the

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:28.760
sixth antifa antagonized the police who then got into a fight with q anon people who then stormed

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:33.560
the capital and took poop on schumer's desk which was a false flag very false or something patriots

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:39.240
got set up trump supporters tried to fight them off of course it was a noble but uh doomed much

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:44.280
like the 300 at thermopoly yeah they were doomed to failure but they fought heroically to protect

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:51.640
the capital absolutely um steve's got another angle on this by the way there was no rioting in

01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:57.720
the capital i happen to know three to four people here from my town who said it was very peaceful

01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:03.560
the police took down the barrier alex was there in fact what people don't know is the forces

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:10.120
operators in there to take pelosi's uh computer this is another q anon wow they were just uh

01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:15.560
there to take uh the special ops to come in to take pelosi's computer oh my god yep he's just

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:23.240
a q guy he's just a q guy so stupid yeah so now yeah this is where the mirror comes up here we

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:28.840
get there's a really really fascinating thing that's going on throughout this uh appearance

01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:35.720
and i i get the feeling that it's steve revealing himself to alex as a like uh a supervillain

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:43.080
okay because he's like alex i've been using you to get these extremist talking points out

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:50.760
and try and start a coup for 20 years don't you understand you're the vehicle you're the useful

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:57.480
idiot you idiot alex can't really hear it no he doesn't like that this is important for you alex

01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:04.280
to understand and all of the listeners you were the method through which we were able to implement

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:12.200
the coup it wasn't when you asked me how do you know what i was doing how could i predict it the

01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:19.480
truth was and still is and by the way you did an excellent interview with mike flinn the truth is

01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:26.360
you were the vehicle through which i was promoting the necessary actions that had to be accomplished

01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:34.120
you shut the fuck up that is fantastic don't put me in this that is fantastic i love it yeah i

01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:39.880
love it alex do you know what sometimes i was lying to you because it's part of the fucking

01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:49.720
op yeah you idiot hey uh i was trying to start a military coup in this country and you did it buddy

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:52.920
mission accomplished like i don't believe any of this stuff but i do believe that steve's

01:41:52.920 --> 01:42:00.040
perception yeah of course and it seems like he's speaking real freely yeah i haven't seen this

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:06.520
since he declared himself in open treason i uh back in 2013 or whatever that was i do like the

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:14.200
freedom that you get with the job security of just being an asshole for alex and the complete lack

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:18.120
of actually doing anything i think he's you can say you can do you did whatever you want i think

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:22.440
he's also like the kind of person who gets high on chaos yeah totally and i think that he's like

01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:29.000
i think he's a little high yeah yeah that sounds right so anyway he used alex yes but he also has

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.800
an explanation for why he couldn't use other media oh they wouldn't have them that's the truth right

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:43.640
his version of it might involve uh some of them are jewish uh why would i expect anything less

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:48.440
steve might get a little anti-semitic why would i expect it all of these elements came out through

01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:53.960
you alex jones the reason we never used the new york times we didn't do the washington post we

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:59.240
didn't do any of the others we understood who controlled them i knew about the murdoch family

01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:06.680
from the day they came over in 1958 i never trusted murdoch i didn't trust his family what people

01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:13.000
didn't know unfortunately is that murdoch's mother's an orthodox jew and he is a totally

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:19.320
corrupt individual and a coward along with his family who brought in all of these stations and

01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:25.640
eventually kicked you and others off of it so you were chosen as the method through which we could

01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:36.520
initiate a military coup this is just wild wild yeah wild god damn so alex understandably scratch

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:41.640
and sniff and you'll find an anti-semite oh i mean steve's revealed that side of himself many times

01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:47.880
totally uh alex is a little caught off guard you could imagine uh because steve is saying a lot of

01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:53.480
stuff that very much contradicts everything he's been saying since the sixth steve uh we've been

01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:57.960
doing this for 20 years how is it that i still don't do pre-interviews with you what the fuck

01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:04.440
why am i still are we still doing this so you were chosen as the method through which we could

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:14.120
initiate a military coup okay well we didn't talk about this beforehand i went to have a peaceful

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:17.960
demonstration to show our numbers to expose election fraud look man yeah i don't know i

01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:23.640
don't know about all that i don't know what any of that shit is about you fucking lunatic you

01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:27.720
did not tell me this earlier i have no idea what the fuck you're talking about i just wanted to

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:34.520
have a march so uh alex started this interview by saying that like steve said that there were

01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:39.800
the watermark ballots sure sure sure sure and a it was a prediction right steve not so much not

01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:46.520
still we marked the computers we marked the ballots we marked the everything that was done

01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:54.040
was a sting operation nothing is changed and what was done it was done by trump a businessman who

01:44:54.040 --> 01:45:01.240
understood the degree of corruption that existed among the democrats this isn't just something

01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:08.040
about the world control of america this was the concept of a fascist state coming in with the

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:17.400
notion of a coronavirus which was not lethal using fauci another catholic who was trained by okay

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:20.840
listen i don't know what's going on here because you've come on the show in 19 years give us a lot

01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:24.920
of good information but sure i mean it looks like trump's leaving in seven days you're saying this

01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:30.600
is a coup uh steve also appears to be quite anti-catholic yeah yeah he points out a number

01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:35.960
of times people who are catholics unsurprising it's very fucked up it's it's so funny to me

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:41.400
every time that they're like the the christian right i'm like man if we were gone they would

01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:47.400
be murdering each other in the streets well it's not even anything unique about christian

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:55.080
extremism or anything it's it's it's any kind of exclusive yeah group any any group that defines

01:45:55.080 --> 01:46:01.400
itself by exclusion will eventually find new ways to exclude people yeah it's part of the the dna

01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:07.480
of that kind of system even the fucking daoist magicians murdered each other so yeah you'll end

01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:12.600
up like you know an all-white ethno state will eventually uh alienate people of different hair

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:17.320
colors totally you know eventually the that's how this works it's the only way to continue to drive

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:24.120
profit yeah so alex is like hey man look we got like a week left until the fucking inauguration

01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:29.480
how's this gonna work yeah sell me on this one doc quantify this for me your view your perspective

01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:35.240
on this how is it a successful military coup against the deep state who he knows there and

01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:41.480
is corrupt uh the globalist arm of the deep state i guess if biden gets in in seven days are you

01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:45.400
saying trump's gonna get in there's about to be mass arrest we don't have a lot of time here

01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:52.040
like 150 hours what are you saying is about to happen i'm about to say that biden is not going

01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:56.840
to be the president of the united states what i'm going to be saying is that there have been

01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:04.360
massive arrests and what i'm saying in effect is that we on martial law and we have a military coup

01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:11.400
q anon's real baby oh man yeah talk about that's that's a non-answer that's such a mirror isn't it

01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:19.080
just alex finally just being like oh god you sound crazy yeah yeah and listen to this next clip this

01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:24.600
is where i was like alex has got to be realizing this dude is like out of his mind yeah there is

01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:31.240
no globalism that's going to be involved we have shut down pakistan we have shut down part of

01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:38.760
england we're already the well they're all talking about stepping down whoa whoa whoa listen for a

01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:45.560
minute the pope was arrested well over a year ago the reason why he was arrested alex because on

01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:52.680
your show i said this pope was corrupt and had been involved with terrorist organizations 20

01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:58.760
to 30 years ago i was forbidden to take him out under a cyrus fan wait a minute you're saying the

01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:03.240
pope well who's the guy we've seen traveling around the world in last year i don't see anybody

01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:11.960
traveling around the world right now you don't see anybody what what the fuck so yeah the pope got

01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:17.080
arrested a year ago apparently who's the guy we see going around you don't see anybody shit man

01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:24.120
alex has got to be like oh no that is because this is exactly that moment that so many people

01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:30.600
have had to have had with alex is eventually it's like okay this guy is literally saying to my face

01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:39.240
everything i've ever believed is a lie or controlled by him um so i can either believe this

01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:49.080
and then i'm gone or i have to stop for a second and go like oh no shit oh no so the two of them

01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:53.640
get into a little bit of a fight sure about whether or not trump is going to stay president

01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:57.240
and if you listen carefully at the end of this clip you can hear steve's wife laughing in the

01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:03.080
background but i'm just telling you in seven days pacenic tell us what's gonna who's gonna be the

01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:10.280
president what's about to happen seven days let me repeat it again jones it's going to be trump

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:15.720
it will not be biden biden's people will be arrested there will be people who will be

01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:23.480
arrested pelosi biden humor that's what's going to happen and if i'm wrong fine don't put me on

01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:30.440
your show if i'm right what else are you going to do you can even yeah his wife's laughing quite a

01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:35.240
bit in the background throughout this interview i think she's loving it she's having a ball yeah

01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:42.680
so i think steve doesn't like the fact that alex is trying to pretend that this whole incident on

01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:48.440
january 6th right was some kind of a false flag sure you have to blame the left no just own it

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:54.920
man yeah just why why even pretend anymore i love it and i see the left provocateuring right wing

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:59.080
groups for a bunch of craziness this weekend and it doesn't look good to me so i don't want to

01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:03.880
encourage people like you saw the q guys going to the capital of zip ties they thought they were in

01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:10.600
a secret mission arrest people alex quiet down a bit you've never been in a military coup you do

01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:15.640
not understand what that means you do not understand how quickly we work and how long

01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:21.880
we've been preparing for this yeah so he's golden alex four stars yeah go home and tell your mother

01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:26.840
you're brilliant this is a little different though this is almost just like mask off time

01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:35.480
alex alex let's do this we hate democracy fuck it where it's time yeah and steve gets a little

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:41.080
a little insulting mike down for this because i loved this clip so the one thing that they can

01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:47.080
come to an agreement on is that there's martial law that's going on right now alex asks so why

01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:54.120
are there black helicopters in austin and steve's response to it is like whoa perfect the one thing

01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:57.160
i know you're saying it's true the one thing you're saying is true is we are under martial

01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:04.200
law right now it's not just in dc that's correct i've said it repeatedly you're under martial law

01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:09.560
everywhere the state of california blackhawk helicopters hovering over downtown austin this

01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:16.040
morning because you're you're you're sitting down in austin you're working very hard in your studio

01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:22.040
and you're trying to sell vitamins we don't send blackhawk helicopters everywhere this is not just

01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:27.480
special forces why do i see blackhawk helicopters because you're trying to scare people

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:39.720
oh my god oh my god steve is dipping his balls into alex's eyes that is a scathing answer that

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:44.840
is hilarious why do i see the scares you're trying to sell pills yeah i sell these vitamins

01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:49.800
you're a fucking drug dealer alex that's what you are yeah so alex is not he's not having a

01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:56.200
good time with this interview but he thinks that he's capable of having this interview and i would

01:51:56.200 --> 01:52:01.400
say he's wrong i'm gonna ask the tough questions here uh a 19-year history with this guy on air

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:07.640
he's giving us 99 good stuff but i mean gosh i hope he's right now some say don't have him on

01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:11.880
now you can burn in hell too you know this idea that i'm just supposed to have one view on here

01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:16.520
one idea this is all in flux we are under martial law i just think that if you're gonna have

01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:22.120
interviews with people like this they should be a little bit more uh well done you shouldn't be

01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:28.840
caught off guard by him telling you that you have been a 30-year instrument of his desire to start a

01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:36.040
military coup 20 years no pre-interviews 20 years 20 years i've been doing this this happens i once

01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:41.800
every four months once a week yeah i think that it's like really i don't know i i don't think

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:49.080
that you know you should have blanket uh no uh no absolutely no talking to steve or whatever sure

01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:57.160
but i do think that uh it behooves you to prepare you should prepare yeah yeah i i can't imagine

01:52:57.880 --> 01:53:05.240
thinking that steve is in pocket you know yeah like steve is a loose cannon at the best of times

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:10.840
you can't expect steve to hold to the line no he doesn't before the first time he burned alex like

01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:17.800
in 2004 yeah exactly exactly maybe alex could be forgiven how many times has steve been put on the

01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:26.840
back bunch for a year damn it again so they make a bet okay here's the bet we're gonna have alex

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:34.360
once and for all if i'm wrong i will never appear on your show again but if i'm right i become one

01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:40.840
of your official paid commentators super all you want that you're right i'll hardy and pay you can

01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:49.000
be on show every day that's correct all right so we have that bet right yes okay so alex is eating

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:56.040
oh and this is weird to me because this implies that steve wants to work at infowars yes why

01:53:56.040 --> 01:54:04.200
hasn't he been uh he just doesn't have the time he's making this wild bet it doesn't have the

01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:08.680
time you know maybe this is an exit strategy because he knows that he's going to be wrong

01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:13.320
yeah and then he's like oh i'll never have to appear on this dumbass this is his retirement

01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:18.200
this is his last episode yeah because he is revealing it all yeah much like the magician

01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:24.200
yeah showing all the cards yeah but that's not about me it was i'm talking about you alex you

01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:30.680
were the vehicle that was initially anointed say by me all right but if you were anointed because

01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:37.480
i took that risk to say this is going to be the major vehicle for where we're going to go in the

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:45.080
next 20 or 30 years so in this process you have to remember what is this coup about this is a coup

01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:51.320
to pay back the chinese for the corruption cowardice for the wars that they sent us in iraq

01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:58.520
and afghanistan to obama who sent up the war including biden who specifically sent soldiers

01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:04.120
there and we lost 5 000 people there alex do you understand that i have been using you to

01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:09.400
uh try and build up a terrorist insurrection as payback against my political enemies

01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:17.240
you shouldn't just say that well you should you should know he's gonna say something like this

01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:21.000
beforehand if you're the host of the show yeah because it's tough to roll with that's fantastic

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:24.920
especially when you don't have to throw it to commercial break and steve somebody who has too

01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:29.800
much respect in your universe for you to just be like go fuck yourself i just don't know how you

01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:35.480
could respond to that with anything other than so you are saying that you have been controlling me

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.760
you've been running aside you've been running you've been everything that i've been saying

01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:46.760
from you is in purpose of one goal not necessarily the truth for 20 years you have

01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:53.000
harbored this grudge uh i think that alex knows that he's full of shit though so he doesn't have

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:59.880
to he doesn't have to wrestle with it too much worry too much about that and uh steve uh maybe

01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:06.680
he's an anti-semite but yeah he's also apparently a failed uh individual in the world of show

01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:15.000
business um you know he he wrote a couple books with tom clancy sure uh a ways back and hey one

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:21.720
of his books was apparently going to be turned into a tv show uh but then something in hollywood

01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:28.280
didn't go well okay i'll give you an example just recently state of emergency was picked up by one

01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:36.040
of the major presidents of cw network and that person whom i've known for years in hollywood

01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:41.000
said i want to help you out what happened when he found out i was involved in a coup

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:48.760
he was disgusted what happened to all of hollywood among american jews they're incompetent they're

01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:59.080
ignorant wild wow an old white man who failed in hollywood blaming the jews that is so original

01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:05.880
damn yeah that's wildly original that is just but i do think like you take that part out of it take

01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:10.040
the anti-semitism part out of it i think it's pretty hilarious that he's like all right i had

01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:14.760
this screenplay yeah the guy at cw loved it but then he found out i was involved in a coup all

01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:21.320
of these fucking guys have a goddamn screenplay no but but hey why am i being kicked out of hollywood

01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:26.440
because i was involved i did was involve myself in a coup what are you oh you're gonna be disgusted

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:30.440
by that i thought you'd be impressed bunch of squares how many accues have you been involved

01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:37.000
with huh so alex uh realizes that hey uh if steve's right i gotta hire him right so let's talk about

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:47.400
uh salary okay so i took dr steve pacinik's bet that if trump is president on january 21st 2021

01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:51.480
that we're gonna hire pacinik with a daily show if he wants it i'll pay him 200 000 a year

01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:58.520
he's got that bet but he's not allowed if he loses the bet to just go away he has to come back on the

01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:03.640
show not to humiliate him i'm wrong about stuff i felt like i was set up but also maybe to humiliate

01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:10.920
him i would hope to humiliate yeah i i would say that it there's no way that dr steve comes back on

01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:17.960
for a while to to be humiliated no because alex is going to want to do a whole oh i just sell

01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:23.640
fucking vitamins do i is that what i do there will be a long break you won't see him for a while yeah

01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:29.160
yeah yeah um but also i don't think it would work in alex's interests to humiliate him either because

01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:33.720
you know there'll be a little splash back on the info war sure why do you even talk to this guy

01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:39.480
why do you take anything he says seriously true fucking liar but alex is also petty to the point

01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:45.080
of throwing his entire life away true yeah it's competing forces i don't know exactly how it goes

01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:50.600
we'll see how we'll see what wins out in the end so this gave me chills alex is talking about like

01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:55.880
he's trying to ask steve a question he's like steve you're a nice guy and then steve has to remind him

01:58:55.880 --> 01:59:03.240
am i dr pochenik you're a nice guy and a smart guy but i i just i don't think you mean bad i just

01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:07.720
think you're being overly optimistic here so we're gonna find out in seven days and seven days you're

01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:16.120
coming back on aren't you absolutely but remember one thing about me how is a very nice guy able to

01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:24.280
take out the kamir rouge without any weapons able to take out the soviet union without any weapons

01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:31.080
able to take this riddle noriega without any weapons what do you understand what this nice guy

01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:36.680
does do you understand yeah i'm a nice guy i'm gonna answer that i fuck with people i'm gonna

01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:44.040
answer that riddle dan uh i'm gonna go with uh he doesn't no no but but he's the what the message

01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:48.920
of that is i appear to be a nice guy but i'm a sociopath i was gonna go with uh the message was

01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:55.560
more i didn't actually do any of those things no but alex is so gullible that like someone like

01:59:55.560 --> 02:00:00.680
steve would be able to manipulate him pretty easily that's true i mean if you can get him

02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:06.760
to believe that he's done all these things geopolitically like yeah i've been malevolently

02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:12.760
fucking with you the way that you think i would have if i took down the so yeah exactly yeah

02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:19.400
i'm not a nice guy no i'm an asshole yeah i just told you that you sold vitamins dickwad yeah

02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:23.560
so alex wants to know how biden's not going to be president because he wants specifics i would like

02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:29.160
specifics uh we learn instead about steve's pets that sounds right i'm trying to figure out so you

02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:33.080
can't tell us how this magic's gonna happen and joe biden's gonna step down in seven days i mean

02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:39.720
explain to me the details i just said it to you you you you're perseverating alex i said to you

02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:47.320
there will be arrests of the biden's the pelosis it's going on now he will not come to the

02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:56.920
presidency i hope you're right can we meet your cat please i only have two i have two cats and

02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:01.400
three dogs so alex i think got a little uncomfortable because steve is basically

02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:07.960
just disseminating cue shit yeah on his show so what's what's mrs pacenik feeling like i don't

02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:15.000
know man i would like to know what her day to day is like yeah i don't know i i i there's a little

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:20.040
bit of curiosity but also i don't care you know like personal lives and stuff totally i just see

02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:24.440
them i just see them both like on the back porch laughing about how they're fucking with alex

02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:29.240
absolutely like like they both got their books yeah yeah and tom clancy novels exactly and

02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:34.520
steve's got a lit cigarette over there just burning slow and then they both stop for one

02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:38.520
second and steve just looks up and he just goes oh my god you have no idea what i'm going to tell

02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:42.680
alex tomorrow it is going to be hilarious i'm going to tell them we arrested the pope a year

02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:47.880
ago i am going to tell alex we arrested the fucking pope yeah and she loses her shit that'd

02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:55.640
be great so steve uh is a doctor he has a doctorate and he thinks that that means something

02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:02.440
either i'm a genius or i just see ordinary problems and say you know what you're wrong

02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:09.240
that's what allowed me to be a doctor and what does a doctor really do he saves lives and he

02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:16.760
and he can kill lives you better think very carefully that this nice guy is what he may or

02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:26.840
may not be whoa whoa steve is saying that because he's a doctor he has the right to give and take

02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:33.880
lives some people tell you about this oath that you take when you become a doctor dan and they're

02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:41.560
wrong sometimes you kill for pleasure or gain those are the reasons you become a doctor i don't

02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:49.320
know if doctors get the right to kill so steve insists that there will be arrests before the

02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:54.600
inauguration so we got a real clock on that one closing comments here we're gonna see some we're

02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:59.400
gonna see some fireworks in the next seven days now you're not gonna see fireworks you're gonna

02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:04.920
see a lot of arrests and it's gonna be quiet and you're gonna see martial law we've clamped down

02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:10.440
the cities you already see in washington it's clamped down we clamped down in berlin we clamped

02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:16.200
down in pakistan we clamped down in italy and now you will also make another prediction this

02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:23.160
nice man the italian government will fall apart within 24 hours other than that alex i've had a

02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:29.320
wonderful time and i hope to see you again go fuck yourself i'm gonna throw this one last bombshell

02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:38.920
out to you italy gone tomorrow in a day and also fuck you fuck you i'm at i've had a very great

02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:45.640
time explaining to you that i've been fucking with you for decades yeah and you can't do shit

02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:51.560
oh that's a good interview it is pretty good i would feel pretty confident if i was stevie

02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:56.040
peas at the end of that one yeah and i think that alex is so taken aback that all he can do is really

02:03:56.040 --> 02:04:00.680
like this butter let's talk about your cats let me ask you a question what is your cat's the cat

02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:13.240
that was on the tv's name geronimo that's cultural appropriation you got what's the other cat what's

02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:21.480
the other what's the other cat's name nona meaning no name she's about four years old well you we

02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:30.440
should nominate nona to be the first female president you know what i i love you alex

02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:36.840
could you stage a coup for his daughter pajening and put your cat in a little snippy no i want to

02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:42.680
really have a real president for the first time we haven't had a real president in 50 years neither

02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:48.360
the bush the clintons the obamas the bidens none of them were real presidents now you're going to

02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:53.160
see a real president so what alex was doing there was kind of trying to take back power in the

02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:59.240
dynamics like would you stage a coup to put your cat in yeah it's sort of mocking the resume that

02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:05.320
alex has given uh steve and it's ineffective no he's already empowered steve way too much

02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:09.640
steve doesn't give a shit no try and make fun of me yeah i just said italy was gonna be gone

02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:15.240
tomorrow i arrested the pope a year ago what do you got on me oh you're gonna make me feel stupid

02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:22.440
i just said that the pope has been gone for a year and told you that even though yes you have seen

02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:28.520
the pope around you haven't seen anybody yep and this just leaves alex in a bind all right my

02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:33.480
friends i'm alex Jones your host that was a wild interview i i sure hope dr botanics right you

02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:36.760
know mainstream media and the globalists want us to believe whatever they say they tell so many

02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:40.680
big lies that it makes you get to the point we don't even know what the truth is anymore

02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:47.000
is it wishful thinking is it hoping um that guy's been involved in overthrow governments a lot of

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:52.600
the big stuff i mean i don't want a military coup we're already under a chinese globalist coup so i

02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:56.840
just don't know what to say about any of it i'm just here covering it he's so pathetic yeah that's

02:05:56.840 --> 02:06:04.840
sad he can't even operate as a sincere person because to attack steve raises too many questions

02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:09.240
about his own credibility and all of the conspiracies that he's based on steve over the

02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:16.280
years so he's stuck in a lurch where he has to be well i hope he's right it could happen if steve

02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:22.120
is what you pretend he is there's no hoping he's not saying these things like oh maybe this no

02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:29.880
thing he did it he did it and he's doing it exactly and you're still being used the fact

02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:34.680
that you how could you not i just don't understand how you could let somebody say i have been

02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:40.120
using you for 20 years to your face and not be like then go fuck yourself well in many ways this

02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:53.480
is kind of like the nigerian email scam i think we just hit the button and the show is over yeah

02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:59.320
you just did it i think you just nailed it that's full circle it's all over so um after this alex

02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:02.680
has an interview with laura loomer but i don't really care she's just complaining about how she

02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:09.480
had a tough time at the airport and i don't care yeah uh it's a zero especially after that epic

02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:15.080
interview with yeah no we can't no wow that's the end of the episode i can't wait to see what

02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:22.440
happens like not i mean i don't think that you know trump's sting operation is real i kind of

02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:27.240
doubt it yeah i think i think the inauguration will happen and i just want to see how they deal

02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:32.040
with it i i'm gonna guess denial i'm gonna guess that they pretend that this didn't happen sure

02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:36.520
this interview didn't happen yeah yeah steve will disappear for a month or two yeah and then he'll

02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:41.880
come back uh with a new narrative of some sort much like a pro wrestler whose character has

02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:47.160
grown weary yeah uh they'll get repackaged they'll come up with a new character and show back up in a

02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:52.920
few months i just don't understand see now the thing that confuses me maybe more than anything

02:07:52.920 --> 02:08:06.280
else now is after seeing the events of the sixth and how trump has decided to pout why would you

02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:13.400
want to install him as your dictator like like i mean i think why would you want a fucking powder

02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:18.600
to be your dictator i think that's pathetic yeah i think that steve thinks it's all like the art of

02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:24.680
war sunzu kind of stuff and so like and i think that's also pretty popular in the q communities

02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:29.480
yeah make yourself look weak when you're strong exactly yeah yeah sure i get that and i i know

02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:34.600
he was expressing a little bit of that stuff sure on the episode and so like he he trump's doing

02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:38.440
this stuff because that's what he's got to do to give the appearances to pull off you know sure

02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:42.520
sure and so i guess you can rationalize that way but that's only going to work for so long

02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:48.840
yeah i mean especially considering the sheer number of times we have seen him pout when he doesn't get

02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:56.200
his way it's a whiny little titty baby yeah so we will be back jordan uh but until then we have a
