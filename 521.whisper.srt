00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,960
N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,920
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,360
I love you.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,360
Challenge Fight, Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,360
Need money, Andy and Kansys, Andy and Kansys.

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,360
Stop it, Andy and Kansys, It's time to pray.

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,360
Andy and Kansys you're on the air, thanks for holding me.

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,360
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,360
I love your world.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,360
I'm Dan.

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,360
I'm Jordan.

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:04,520
We're a couple dudes that like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,840
bit about Alex Jones.

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,560
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
Jordan.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560
Dan!

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
Jordan.

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
Quick question for you.

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Yes, sir.

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
What's your bright spot today?

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
My bright spot today is I'm talking into a new microphone.

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Oh, that's right.

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
We are talking to a new microphone.

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
They look the same.

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,560
I completely forgot.

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Exactly the same.

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
They're the same.

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
Still cheap as a pad microphone.

33
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Yep.

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
But they're new.

35
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,320
I noticed some poppling and crackling in a couple of our recent episodes.

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,920
I decided it was time to get at least new cords, and man, this new windscreen feels

37
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,600
good on my face.

38
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
It does.

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,860
It's much smoother.

40
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,880
It doesn't have years of other people's faces on it.

41
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,880
Yeah, pre-COVID.

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,880
Pre-COVID, other people's faces.

43
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,800
You're the only one who's touched it since then.

44
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,400
For four years, we're the only ones who've touched it, yes.

45
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,600
Yeah, it's nice though.

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:02:00,320
I bought a desk mic stand as well, but it does not attach to the mic holder, so I still

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:09,400
have some work to do on that, but yeah, it's my weekend warrior type project for today.

48
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
I love it.

49
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
How about you?

50
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:23,520
Similar weekend warrior type project, Dan, I have for probably 13 years lived in apartments,

51
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,960
in apartment buildings with people around me.

52
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,160
And so when I left for apartment living, I also left my drum set behind.

53
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,760
I miss it.

54
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,440
Your guy likes to throw some sticks around.

55
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:43,120
I played drums since I was like eight years old, and then I had to stop at 19 for the

56
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,320
aforementioned reasons.

57
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:51,880
And it has been difficult, and finally I realized that you can get an electric drum kit for

58
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,800
like 300 bucks.

59
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
So I got one.

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Wow.

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
And it's fantastic.

62
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,960
Wow, how about that?

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
It's very cheap.

64
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
It's garbage.

65
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
I'm going to break it in a week.

66
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Yeah.

67
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
It's going to be like when I played rock band.

68
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
Yeah, exactly.

69
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Exactly.

70
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Just destroying those pads.

71
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Yeah.

72
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
I'm going to die to death.

73
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,440
But it is so good to get back to drums.

74
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,320
Somehow it's still going to be too loud for your partner.

75
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Totally.

76
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
She's still going to be like, keep it down.

77
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:21,240
Well, I've also, here's the weekend warrior, the last time that I tried having a conversation

78
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,280
while she was at work, our rooms share a wall.

79
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Right, right.

80
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
And I am me.

81
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
Loud.

82
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Loud.

83
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,880
And I have a tendency to toss language about in jest.

84
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,800
Not to fit for the classroom.

85
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
No.

86
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:42,520
Her high school students have heard me speak, so I bought some soundproofing shit, so my

87
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,320
entire room is going to be turned into a studio, essentially.

88
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Good luck with that.

89
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,760
Soundproofing is kind of tough unless you can get inside the walls.

90
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,280
Yeah, I'm working on it.

91
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Well, that's fun.

92
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,320
I hope you have some nice fun Dave Grohl-esque drumming adventures in your future.

93
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
Love it.

94
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,480
Hey, who hasn't played along to Queens of the Stone Age songs for the dead?

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,160
I have, only on rock band.

96
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Yeah.

97
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
But see what I'm saying?

98
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
You're not even a drummer and you've played along with it.

99
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,000
You've never played Everlong on rock band.

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,040
Well, that one's fairly easy.

101
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Not on expert.

102
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,880
Yeah, you don't know your sixteenth notes, brah?

103
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,880
No, I don't.

104
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,680
It's very fast.

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
My foot gets tired.

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,440
I miss rock band.

107
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,960
You let the sticks do the work.

108
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,600
That's what a lot of people don't know about drums.

109
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,840
You think you gotta hit it with your arm.

110
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
You just move your wrist up a little bit.

111
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,920
You say that and it's like a cryptic mystery or something.

112
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
No, it's not a mystery.

113
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
You let the sticks do the work.

114
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,120
You let the sticks do the work, Dan.

115
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
I don't know.

116
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,760
I loved rock band.

117
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:46,640
I spent hours, hours trying to 100% helter-skelter on expert.

118
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,280
I don't think I ever succeeded.

119
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
You never succeeded.

120
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,420
I think I tried it hundreds and hundreds of times because you get an achievement in Beatles

121
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,080
rock band if you're 100% on expert.

122
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,800
I just couldn't get it.

123
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Couldn't get it.

124
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Couldn't do it, huh?

125
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Ringo, gotcha.

126
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Yep.

127
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,080
The classic drummer that throws people on.

128
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
Look.

129
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
I'm sorry.

130
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
I'm sorry.

131
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,160
A lot of the other songs are pretty easy, but helter-skelter is a little complex.

132
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Sure, sure.

133
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,120
I'm also not very good at rhythm based stuff.

134
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
No, that's fine.

135
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,080
I'm sorry if I... I don't mean to make fun of you.

136
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
I'm just a bully.

137
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
I'm a bad person.

138
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
That's all right.

139
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
I'm sorry.

140
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
It's okay.

141
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
Okay.

142
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,880
So, Jordan, today we got an interesting thing on our plates in front of us and that is that

143
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,360
we don't really have an episode.

144
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,560
That is an interesting thing on our plates.

145
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Yeah.

146
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
So, here's what happened.

147
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
What's that?

148
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,600
I did not want to do another episode for today about Alex.

149
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,680
I wanted to push that to Wednesday because I needed personally a break from him.

150
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,280
I was tired of his bullshit.

151
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,320
Last week was emotionally exhausting.

152
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Yeah.

153
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:56,280
Starting on the preparation for Friday's episode on the 8th straight through to present, it's

154
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
been a lot.

155
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,280
It's been a lot of stuff that I grow weary of and then at the same time the payoff of

156
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,200
the interview with Steve Pechenik on our last episode was almost two.

157
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,480
It was season ending.

158
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Yeah.

159
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,000
It felt like it was a fucking season finale.

160
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,120
We got CVPs giving us the fucking cliffhanger.

161
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
And telling Alex to his face.

162
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
When is he going to come back?

163
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Yeah.

164
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,520
I have been lying to you for 20 years.

165
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,560
I decided to anoint you as the vehicle by which I would set off a military coup.

166
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Wait.

167
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
Hold on.

168
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Hold on, doc.

169
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
I have been the puppet master.

170
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
Yeah.

171
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
You think you're in control.

172
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
No, sir.

173
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Hi.

174
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Yeah.

175
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,440
There's something about that that was so satisfying and narratively interesting to

176
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,600
me that I found myself having a really tough time going back to Alex.

177
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Yeah.

178
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
And I know it'll be temporary.

179
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,600
I'll be able to get back on the horse soon, but I sat down to try and listen to other

180
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,000
episodes and I just like, I can't do this.

181
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah.

182
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,840
And so what I wanted to do, naturally in times like this in the past, what we've done is

183
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,800
we've gone to various other online space weirdos.

184
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Sure.

185
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Yeah.

186
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
If we could.

187
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,400
And so yeah, I checked in on Carrie Cassidy over at Project Camelot and she had a video

188
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,640
the day after the storming of the Capitol.

189
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,360
She's on some Q bullshit for 100.

190
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
You bet.

191
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
Yeah.

192
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,880
100% zero, zero possibility that that wasn't going to happen.

193
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
No.

194
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,800
I got really bored listening to that too because aliens weren't in play.

195
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Yeah.

196
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Why would it, what did you say?

197
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,360
Get the fuck out of Q and get back into space, lady.

198
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,480
I did find out from listening to this, but it wasn't worth getting too deep into.

199
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,040
There's apparently an Archon alien, a singular one.

200
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
Okay.

201
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
Just one.

202
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
That runs the CIA.

203
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Okay.

204
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
It did not know that.

205
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
All right.

206
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Okay.

207
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
I didn't learn that.

208
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Okay.

209
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
And it used to be this guy Archon, right?

210
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
Right.

211
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,540
But I think Carrie has some intelligence that he might have died and now there's a female

212
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,320
Archon that's in charge of the CIA.

213
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
All right.

214
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Unclear.

215
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,920
Prove that he's dead and not a shape shifter.

216
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Can't do it.

217
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Yeah.

218
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Can't do it.

219
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
Yeah.

220
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Yeah.

221
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Carrie, bring it to me.

222
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,280
So then I was like, well, I bet Jim Baker's disappointed and I still don't like talking

223
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
about Jim Baker.

224
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
I don't know why.

225
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,640
I just don't, it still makes me a little bit uncomfortable.

226
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Yeah.

227
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Yeah.

228
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,040
I think that I'm not going to be able to go back to that well ever.

229
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,160
Eh, fuck Jim Baker.

230
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,320
I just, I don't, what is he going to say?

231
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
God does shit.

232
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Well, we moved on.

233
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,120
Talk about how great his big ass bucket of oatmeal is.

234
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,920
You and I have both read the Bible and eaten survival food.

235
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
We can just move on.

236
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Yeah.

237
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Yeah.

238
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,000
So then of course I, I was, I was kind of like in a bind.

239
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,760
I was like, I don't know what I'm going to do.

240
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,600
Got to get something together.

241
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,120
And then I remembered that when I was looking at pictures of the Capitol on the sixth, yeah,

242
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,240
I saw somebody wearing a pass the salt shirt, which of course is the name of Dave Dobenmeyer,

243
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
coach Dave.

244
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,680
It's the name of his radio ministry, his YouTube broadcast ministry.

245
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
Pass the salt.

246
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,680
I saw that.

247
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,840
I was like, whoa, there's Dave Dobenmeyer shirts at the protest at the people storming

248
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
there at the Capitol.

249
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Yeah.

250
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,840
Yeah.

251
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
Was he there?

252
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
That would be amazing.

253
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,160
Who else is wearing a Dave Dobenmeyer shirt?

254
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
Well, it wasn't him.

255
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,800
I would have recognized him in the picture.

256
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Okay.

257
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,720
But I was like, coach Dave had to have been there, right?

258
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,280
And so I went and I checked.

259
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Sure.

260
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Dave Dobenmeyer was at the Capitol.

261
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,480
He could not possibly have been there.

262
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
Really?

263
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,480
He was at the Capitol.

264
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Dave Dobenmeyer decided to go storm the Capitol.

265
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Coach Dave.

266
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Son of a bitch.

267
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Yeah.

268
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,280
He led the football team in through.

269
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,840
I can't come up with a metaphor.

270
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,000
Hey guys, win one for the Gipper.

271
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,680
So today I wanted to take a little bit of a look at that, but it's not really much of

272
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
an episode.

273
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:50,120
I wasted a lot of time watching these streams for what will ultimately be kind of, I don't

274
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,880
know, a little bit deflating.

275
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,320
It's not going to be, look, if you like our show, tune back in on Wednesday.

276
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,600
We will have a full episode if you're expecting that.

277
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,320
But we're going to listen to a little bit of Dave Dobenmeyer.

278
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,820
What if an episode of like Battlestar Galactica was like, hey guys, this is a bottle episode.

279
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,920
We couldn't afford to really do much here.

280
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Listen, if you want to see some space shit, come back next week.

281
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,540
So one of the things that I thought was really funny is on the sixth, Dave is, uh, coach

282
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:31,400
is a recording, uh, and doing a live stream from the Metro, from the train in DC.

283
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,320
So it's a little bit iffy, the sound is not great.

284
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,400
The connection is eh, but one of the things that he does that I think is really maybe

285
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,020
unfortunate in hindsight is he literally doxes every single person who's on that train with

286
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,320
him going to DC.

287
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,120
Like if any of them went in the Capitol, his broadcast could be identifying information.

288
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,440
It will, it's look, it's obvious.

289
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,400
This was always going to be the case that this would happen, but the fact that the people

290
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:08,360
most afraid of Bill Gates tracking them all the time have docked themselves so completely.

291
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,880
It's just, it's never not going to be obvious.

292
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,480
He's just going around like, Oh, this is Greg from Idaho.

293
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
Totally.

294
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Totally.

295
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Yeah.

296
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
Don't do this.

297
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
Oh man.

298
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
I love it.

299
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
Yup.

300
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
Yup.

301
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,720
So, uh, Dave gets to, gets to talking about how many people they're going to be there.

302
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,040
I do like how it seems the only people who are uninterested in doxing each other are

303
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,260
Antifa.

304
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,300
They're the only people who are like, Hey, if you're going to video people, don't put

305
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,560
their face in it or say their real names.

306
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Everybody else is like, I'd love to be on TV.

307
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
Yeah.

308
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,880
Here's my social security number.

309
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
Exactly.

310
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
Are you from Nigeria?

311
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,640
I met a guy once.

312
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,360
So he gets to talking about how there's going to be so many people there.

313
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,760
And this is, this is big.

314
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:59,360
This is not just a protest from what I, what I saw Dale, 4 million, they said there's possibly

315
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,240
4 million people that are going to be here in downtown Washington, DC, very, very strong,

316
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
powerful message.

317
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,880
And most of the people have not come just to chant for more years.

318
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,080
No, I don't think so, coach.

319
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,520
I think it's, it's far beyond that once again, Donald Trump is not going to call.

320
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,680
He called for this rally.

321
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,800
He has a platform at nine this morning.

322
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,280
I believe he is going to talk.

323
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,000
He's not, it's not a pep rally.

324
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,040
I do not believe this is game on.

325
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,360
Remember we talked about, you know, we always have 11 men on offense and 11 men on defense

326
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,440
in the field.

327
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,840
This is like, this is like the, the coach turning to the stadium and saying, get on

328
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
the field.

329
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:44,840
Now's the time I think I might be feeling inspired to write a book, your honor exhibit

330
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
eight.

331
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,820
I feel like there'll be, there's a great book to be written about like all of the right

332
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,640
wing media stuff prior to the Capitol storming called this looks bad in hindsight.

333
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,680
Yeah, totally, totally.

334
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,360
But ultimately the thing that's really interesting about it is it's not really that different

335
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,880
than the way they talk normally.

336
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:10,920
You know, it's, it's pretty much hubris, a Nazi tale.

337
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,560
So there's a guy on the bus there and Dave goes around and he, he, he checks in on the

338
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,200
temperature of the people in the crowd.

339
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Sure.

340
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Hey, how are you doing?

341
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
Hey, how are you doing?

342
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Yeah.

343
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Yeah.

344
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Yeah.

345
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
And this guy says it's now or never.

346
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Well, I'll tell you what, it's time.

347
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
We stand up.

348
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
This is it for our country.

349
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
I'd say either now or never.

350
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:35,040
I've enjoyed the blessings of the United States of America for 74 years.

351
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,640
And I, I just don't want to see it go basically to the communists.

352
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
That's what we're looking at.

353
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,080
We've got to hand it off to our children.

354
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
It's our children, grandchildren.

355
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
That's it.

356
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Yeah, man.

357
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,320
The commies, they're coming and it's now or never, you got to stand up and fight these

358
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,840
commies or else your grandkids aren't going to have a capitalist country to live in and

359
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,000
have a great time with.

360
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,400
I like, I like the real low tier of these guys because I recognize how they talk and

361
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,000
that is exactly like comedy producers who have never put on a good show.

362
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Hmm.

363
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,960
I think we're going to have about 4 million people here tonight.

364
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
Oh yes.

365
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Yeah.

366
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
That is, that is awesome.

367
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,800
I think we're going to have so many people here tonight.

368
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,400
I'm telling you, I've heard, I got so many Facebook messages.

369
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,440
People are committed to showing up.

370
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Yeah.

371
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
You should have been here last week.

372
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,560
Oh, well actually it was going to be 4 million, but it rained.

373
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
Yeah.

374
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,560
Exactly.

375
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Yeah.

376
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Oh, I forgot that there was a Bears game today.

377
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
Yeah, exactly.

378
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Yeah.

379
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
Yeah.

380
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
Yeah.

381
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Oh no.

382
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
It's Sunday.

383
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
There's always a good one.

384
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
Yes, exactly.

385
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
Your show is weekly on Sundays.

386
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,760
You got to know there's football.

387
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,960
Got to know there's football, man.

388
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,080
Um, so yeah, they are a little bit, uh, there's a little bit of pride or a little bit of expectation

389
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,680
and excitement.

390
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,040
It's definitely palpable.

391
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,840
You can tell like they feel like they're getting ready to go do something more than chant for

392
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
more years.

393
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Yes.

394
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Yeah.

395
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
For sure.

396
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
Yeah.

397
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
The electricity was clearly in the air.

398
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Yeah.

399
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
Yeah.

400
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,520
And, and, and, and interestingly, I mean, I think that, um, the people who are there

401
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,000
have a lot more to say than just that Biden stole the election.

402
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,960
Um, there's certainly some ideas that are being trafficked on this bus that are interesting.

403
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Great ideas.

404
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
Any highfalutin ideas?

405
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:28,640
Clyde's going to tell us how to become a citizen of our local state's revenue.

406
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:36,160
Actually what you're doing is you're moving from the admiralty and a jurisdiction of the

407
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,280
sea to the jurisdiction of the land and the soil.

408
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,840
And it's just very simple.

409
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,360
You just remove yourself.

410
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,340
You go through the process of the paperwork to remove yourself as a U S citizen and become

411
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,400
a citizen of the state you were born in.

412
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Sure.

413
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,200
And join the assembly of states in your state.

414
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
That sounds right.

415
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,560
And then you become a state national or a state citizen.

416
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,560
Oh, of course.

417
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,240
There are rumors that Trump is a state national and has already gone through this and understands

418
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,000
all of this.

419
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,320
And what we have to do, we've talked about succeeding.

420
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,880
We don't need to succeed our states.

421
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:17,680
We need to succeed ourselves one at a time and move over to the land jurisdiction.

422
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,360
And what we're doing right now is thanks to judge Anna von Reitz.

423
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,240
She's done all the paperwork so that we're now right now are repopulating the original

424
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,720
constitution of 1787.

425
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,600
So I think Anna von Reitz, if I recall correctly, is somebody that I've heard Carrie Cassidy

426
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
bring up quite a bit.

427
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,560
So there's a nice little overlap.

428
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Sure.

429
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,560
Of that.

430
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Yeah.

431
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,080
I wrote in a scream.

432
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
I wrote in a scream.

433
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
Yeah.

434
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
Yeah.

435
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,800
That's why we're in the room, can't tell those are big old letters.

436
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Those are big old letters.

437
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
What do we got there?

438
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:59,920
He just basically said, all right, that the president that they love most is not an American

439
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,920
citizen.

440
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Yeah, that is a problem with his theory.

441
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Yeah.

442
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,080
But that's because sovereign citizens are higher up on the ladder.

443
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,960
So you're going to come at me with Obama wasn't born here and then you're going to tell me

444
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,080
that your president isn't even American?

445
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,080
Well.

446
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,880
Get the fuck out of here.

447
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
Paper American.

448
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,120
What is that even?

449
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,760
Constitution of 1870.

450
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Sure.

451
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,760
Sure.

452
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
Sure.

453
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,420
That's all just QAnon sovereign citizen shit.

454
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,420
It's a bummer.

455
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,500
It's a real bummer.

456
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:34,080
It's amazing to me how important paperwork is to these people and how unimportant reading

457
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
is.

458
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
Yeah.

459
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,080
Yeah.

460
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,080
It's fun too because you know, you got Dave here, coach Dave on the bus and he's having

461
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,400
this guy explain how you become a citizen of the land.

462
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Yeah.

463
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,040
You got to take your away from the admiralty.

464
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,720
And he's not like, I don't know about that, man.

465
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,960
He's like, oh great, I can't wait to have you on the show again and talk more about

466
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
this.

467
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Yeah.

468
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
What?

469
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
So good.

470
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,360
But look, this guy knows what he's talking about.

471
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,160
I think he went to law school.

472
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,480
So our whole movement, I believe, is going to be about teaching people how to get out

473
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,640
of the jurisdiction of the admiralty law and the law of the sea and the Vatican, which

474
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,160
is the law of the air.

475
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,520
The law comes from L-A-W, land, air, water.

476
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,680
That's where the word law comes from.

477
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,480
The three jurisdictions.

478
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,920
The Pope figured this out in 1300.

479
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,560
That's who we're living under right now.

480
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
The Vatican.

481
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,560
The same pope?

482
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
All of this is under that.

483
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:32,080
The only way to get out of it is to go and land in soil and get back under the constitution

484
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,480
of 1787.

485
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
Sure.

486
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,140
Land, air, water.

487
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,420
That's what law means.

488
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,480
Are we doing this?

489
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,840
Are we doing this, Dan?

490
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
We're not.

491
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,480
The Vatican is the law of the air.

492
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
Right.

493
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,600
And then I think the British empire is the law of the sea.

494
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Sure.

495
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,800
The maritime law is under the British common admiralty law.

496
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Sure.

497
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Sure.

498
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,080
And then I guess the land is just everybody.

499
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
The land is freedom.

500
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,600
The land is just the constitution of the United States.

501
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Freedom.

502
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Yeah.

503
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,760
But not the United States, individual states.

504
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
Right.

505
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,240
Because we're also the articles of people?

506
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,220
Does this apply to people in other countries?

507
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,440
Like the law of the ground?

508
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,680
The Vatican owns their air, so they don't have any choice.

509
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,400
See, the pope figured this out in 1300.

510
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Figured what out?

511
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,680
That law means land, air, and water.

512
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:30,240
In what language?

513
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,240
It's not spelled that way.

514
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
Oh man.

515
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,240
All right.

516
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,120
Earth, fire, water, air, long ago.

517
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
My father.

518
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
Was the avatar.

519
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
Talk about elements.

520
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Oh man.

521
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
J.K. Simmons.

522
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
Fantastic!

523
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,360
Elements equal jurisdictions.

524
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,120
You ever fuck with Avatar, Dan?

525
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,120
No.

526
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,440
Not the Cameron bullshit.

527
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,200
I'm talking about young boy with air powers.

528
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,280
I watched the James Cameron movie because I was brought along to it by friends who insisted

529
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,280
I go see it.

530
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
That was a terrible idea.

531
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
No, wait.

532
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
That's Serenity.

533
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
Serenity's great.

534
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,240
But I also saw Avatar because it was too big to not see.

535
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
Well.

536
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,560
You know, it was one of those things that like, you gotta-

537
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,160
You didn't see the last, the Rise of Skywalker.

538
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
I'm an adult.

539
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,520
It's a joke.

540
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,800
There was a time when that came out, I was of the age where it's like, yeah, you gotta

541
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
see this.

542
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Well, sure.

543
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
People are going to be talking about it.

544
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Yes.

545
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
And I don't care about that now.

546
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
No.

547
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,520
So, I think I did see the last Skywalker.

548
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
You did not.

549
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
I think I did.

550
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
When?

551
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
When?

552
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
Tell me when.

553
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,720
When did you get it on DVD, Dan?

554
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Yeah.

555
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
It's under the red box.

556
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,920
No, I think I did see it though.

557
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
We'll deal with this later.

558
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Okay.

559
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Okay.

560
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
Anyway, there's three jurisdictions.

561
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
Sure, sure.

562
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
Law.

563
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,920
Okay.

564
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,280
We're all under, wait, he's saying that we're under maritime law, but apparently the Vatican,

565
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
that's air law.

566
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,200
Yeah, I would like to- That's avian law.

567
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:02,560
Before we go any further, in any conversation with this guy, I want to know exactly the

568
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
laws of air.

569
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
Mm-hmm.

570
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,200
I want to know what air law is that the pope has control over.

571
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Yeah.

572
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,680
If I were to go any further in this conversation with this guy, which I wouldn't, here's how

573
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
I would go.

574
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
What's over there?

575
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
And I just walk.

576
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,680
Smoke bomb.

577
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,800
I had a friend who really perfected that move, like pretending that he saw something somewhere

578
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
else- Oh, really?

579
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
And just would walk off.

580
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,160
I really admired the hell out of his ability to get away from things.

581
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,320
You know, I've done that many times.

582
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,760
You know you get into those party conversations where it's four people and the three of them

583
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,160
start having a conversation and you're like, I want to jump in, but it's just not going

584
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,400
to happen.

585
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,120
You look over and you're like, oh my God.

586
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,240
And then you just walk away.

587
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
You saw a friend.

588
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
Yeah.

589
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
Yeah.

590
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,080
I think the key to pulling that off perfectly is that you have to end up somewhere that's

591
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,960
not in direct eye shot of the people you just left.

592
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Sure.

593
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

594
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Because otherwise you're just going to be milling around over there.

595
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

596
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Yeah.

597
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,480
Anyway, Dave has heard that there's a lot to be worried about.

598
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,280
There's a lot of threats- Sure.

599
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
On the ground.

600
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
There's like Antifa and what have you.

601
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
Yeah.

602
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
All right.

603
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
He's not worried about any of that shit.

604
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,480
I'm not worried that they may have bricks down there that they're going to throw at

605
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
us.

606
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,200
I'm not worried that they're going to shoot pepper spray at us.

607
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,160
I'm not worried that the governor is going to call in this person and the mayor is going

608
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
to call in this.

609
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
I'm not worried about any of that stuff.

610
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
Huh?

611
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
We're at war.

612
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
We're going to war.

613
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,520
We're prepared for war, spiritual war.

614
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,360
But if the physical war breaks out, there's going to be 4 million of us.

615
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
They better have a bunch.

616
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,360
They better have a bunch of people because this is a boiling-

617
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:36,360
Well, here's a true work of authority.

618
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,800
The mayor of D.C. has no military authority, not over the National Guard or anything.

619
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:47,560
All she has is D.C. police and guess what, D.C. police will step, they will step aside.

620
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,040
There's too many of them.

621
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,760
So this doesn't look good in hindsight.

622
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,680
Well, well, well, well.

623
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:02,560
These sort of conversations certainly seem to be pre-, pre-, pre-, what would you call

624
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,560
that?

625
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
What's the right word I'm looking for?

626
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,840
Uh, premeditated?

627
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
Is that a way to go?

628
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:14,240
I mean, it's very much like, oh, you know, like, if you accept the idea that like, oh,

629
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,800
they kind of are planning on fucking storming the Capitol, you'd kind of be like, oh yeah,

630
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,200
this is the kind of conversation you'd expect to hear before that.

631
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Before you storm the Capitol.

632
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

633
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,520
Hey, look, hey, we don't want any trouble, but if there's trouble, there's four million

634
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,760
of us and the cops are on our side, so what the fuck?

635
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,600
If the Capitol was the Constitution, these assholes are the preamble.

636
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,740
Yeah, preamble was probably one of the words I was trying to look for, and I just couldn't

637
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,220
figure out a way to make it work grammatically.

638
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:47,480
So there's, there's these Capitol police, sure, and there's not enough of them, man.

639
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,800
There's just not enough.

640
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,640
There's not enough to stop Dave.

641
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,240
Hey Dale, how many policemen would you say there are in, in, uh, DC?

642
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,760
I'm just going to throw out another thousand.

643
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
Yeah.

644
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,160
You know, listen, Jefferson parish, Jefferson parish, we have, we have 1500 officers that

645
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,720
not just officers, people who work in the desk and detectives and everything.

646
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,680
And that's for a population of a half a million people.

647
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,440
I don't necessarily know if they can have a thousand in DC.

648
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,440
Here's my point.

649
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,560
Do they have enough to push back?

650
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,720
What if, uh, 500,000 people said they'd had enough of what if just, what if just 10%,

651
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,040
what if 200,000 people said they had enough and decided they were going to storm the Capitol?

652
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,120
I don't know if they're going to, I don't know if they're going to, what, what if that

653
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
were to happen, folks?

654
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,000
We don't have any idea what might break loose here.

655
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,560
Now we, none of us want violence.

656
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:44,080
None of us are advocating violence, but the truth of the matter is there's violence all

657
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,080
around it.

658
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,800
The Bible says that the kingdom of God suffers violence in the days of John the Baptist until

659
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,960
now, the kingdom of God has suffered violence and violent men have taken up by force.

660
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,520
See, listen, it's not the violence, it's the force.

661
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,680
They're forcing us to take vaccinations.

662
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,180
They're forcing us to close our shops.

663
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,040
They're forcing us to not travel.

664
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,320
They're forcing us to not go visit our parents in nursing homes.

665
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
They're forced.

666
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,320
You understand?

667
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
Do you understand this?

668
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,240
It's the same argumentation style that you hear from folks.

669
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Like we don't want trouble.

670
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,020
We don't want any kind of violence, but all violence that could be seen as offensive is

671
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,500
secretly defensive because they want to give me a vaccine.

672
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:28,000
It's not great to hear this from someone who's presumably a religious leader.

673
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,720
I would argue that spreading a disease is violence, Dan.

674
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,820
Offensive violence.

675
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,920
There's an interesting argument that you could make with that.

676
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,240
And it seems like they are doing it.

677
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,920
I would actually maybe, yeah, you'd want to probably have some qualification for like

678
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
negligence.

679
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
Sure.

680
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,920
Or something.

681
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

682
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,120
Unless you're spitting on people.

683
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,120
And then it's...

684
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
Well, there's that.

685
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
Then you're out of line.

686
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
Eh, I don't know.

687
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,760
If you're aware that wearing a mask can save somebody else's life, and you're like, I'm

688
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,040
never wearing a mask, you have now committed violence.

689
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,240
Yes, but how do you prove that the person actually believes...

690
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,920
Even under your own libertarian nonsense, no, yeah, fuck off.

691
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,120
But you would have to then prove that the person is aware that the masks help.

692
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,320
They believe that, and are choosing to not do it.

693
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,560
Because the denial could be strong.

694
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,140
Sure, sure.

695
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,120
I don't know if I care about denial.

696
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,120
You may not.

697
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
The court might, though.

698
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,520
The court might, but it's kind of like a math problem.

699
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,200
Like I don't care if you think that math doesn't work.

700
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,440
It still does.

701
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,160
So you have to live by math.

702
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Right.

703
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
Fair enough.

704
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,000
So they spend some more time on this bus, the reception gets bad, and then it goes to

705
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,720
the guy in the studio, and when I say studio, I mean his office, and he's another preacher,

706
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,640
and he just has some people pray and stuff, and I don't care.

707
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,960
Then later, they arrive at the Capitol.

708
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,280
There's at least one picture I saw that was of someone in a Pass the Salt shirt, so they

709
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
were around.

710
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,280
All right.

711
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:15,760
And the D-heads is what I'm calling somebody who wears a Pass the Salt shirt.

712
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,240
Hey, would you pass the salt?

713
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,240
So we get to the next day now, the 7th, and Dave comes on his show, and there's a little

714
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,720
bit of reflection going on.

715
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,160
We are over the target, and as Alex Jones said about 25 years ago, it's an info war.

716
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:37,120
It's an information war, and boys and girls, we are a dead center target in this information

717
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,120
war.

718
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,840
I'm not trying to... I'm just a fly on the butt of an elephant.

719
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,280
I understand that, but I'm going to tell you something.

720
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,760
We are over the target like we've never been.

721
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,840
So he's just using Alex's language, he's directly referencing Alex.

722
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,920
This dude's just a fucking info warrior.

723
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,360
Man, I don't want to be killed by a bunch of cowards like this.

724
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:10,000
I don't like the idea that this extremist political anti-communist ideology is being

725
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,840
so successfully marketed under the veil of religion.

726
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,320
I really, really think that that's terrifying.

727
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,600
I would rather be killed in a fight with ISIS, because ISIS is at least like, I want to kill

728
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,000
you.

729
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,360
One of this wishy-washy cowardice from the conservatives just like, I don't want any

730
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,760
violence, but I'm going to have to kill you guys.

731
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,560
And then when violence does happen, whoa, whoa, whoa guys, we didn't ever want... At

732
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,520
least ISIS is like, I'm going to kill you.

733
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,640
There is a... terrorist groups generally do take responsibility for their actions.

734
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,720
Yeah, for shit they didn't even do sometimes.

735
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,720
Well interestingly, Dave has a very similar take on things after the fact that his hero

736
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,720
Alex Jones does.

737
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Strange.

738
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,840
Part of the information war that's going on, and here's going to be your greatest battle

739
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,400
and my greatest battle, is you're going to have to convince the people that you come

740
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:12,400
in contact with that what happened yesterday in Washington DC wasn't this.

741
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,080
This wasn't what happened.

742
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:21,760
The storming of the Capitol building, the infiltration of Antifa, BLM, as part of that

743
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
infiltration.

744
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,000
Yes, patriots did break through.

745
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,280
They did break through and get into the Capitol building.

746
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,880
Yes, but can I tell you something?

747
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,800
Are you listening to me?

748
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
They let us.

749
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,240
Folks, listen to me.

750
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,800
They let us break through.

751
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:45,880
They let the patriots break through and then embedded BLM in the group.

752
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,460
And all the wicked, crazy stuff that happened inside that Capitol building, that was not

753
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,080
done by patriots, folks.

754
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,280
That was not done.

755
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:59,480
I love the idea that he's saying on the 7th, it gets suspicious that the cops let them

756
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,640
through when the morning of- On the 6th.

757
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,720
The cops are going to let us through.

758
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
Yeah.

759
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,000
It's very strange.

760
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,560
It implies a real change of perspective about like, oh, this actually happened.

761
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,560
Oh shit.

762
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

763
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,080
I just see that so universally with these folks that you look in on.

764
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,640
We got to find a way to not take responsibility for whoever shit on that desk.

765
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:31,120
If anybody comes at me with like, listen to any conservative in the media now, it's just

766
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
no.

767
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,000
What are you talking about?

768
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Don't even.

769
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,680
I can't engage with it.

770
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:43,400
This was the moment where it's like, no matter what you do, you caused this and then you

771
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,600
disavowed it, so go fuck yourself.

772
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
You're a coward.

773
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
Uh-huh.

774
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Yeah.

775
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
A complete coward.

776
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,880
You're worse than ISIS.

777
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,840
Quite a ride for you in comparing things to ISIS.

778
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,880
I'm enjoying it.

779
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,720
They were good as, they were as evil as ISIS for a while.

780
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
It was equivalent.

781
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
Now they're worse.

782
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
Wow.

783
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Yeah, it's bad.

784
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,720
I think that one of the things that I found when I was looking at this was, first of all,

785
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,600
I find Dave Dobenmeyer incredibly boring.

786
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Oh, he's bad.

787
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
Yeah.

788
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,120
And I don't know, maybe it's been a long time since I've looked at any of his actual shows

789
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,320
or anything.

790
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,600
It just struck me as like, you're just taking notes from Infowars shows and preaching with

791
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
it.

792
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,760
You're just doing that.

793
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,700
It's stupid.

794
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:31,760
It's almost like the idea of covering his show actually feels kind of like drinking

795
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
backwash.

796
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,760
Yeah.

797
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Yeah.

798
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
I'm not interested.

799
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Yeah.

800
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:44,080
But he was there and this is an interesting set of circumstances, an interesting set of

801
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
behaviors.

802
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,400
He would be like, hey, Trump is telling us all to get on the field.

803
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:54,580
You know, like, well, I mean the three jurisdictions thing, that's just good, clean fun.

804
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,580
That's fantastic.

805
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,580
Yeah.

806
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,580
That's fantastic.

807
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,800
They're literally talking about the possibility of storming the Capitol and how the police

808
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
will stand down.

809
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
There's not enough of them.

810
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Yep.

811
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
And then the next day there's a conspiracy afoot.

812
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
It's somebody else's fault.

813
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
It's somebody else's fault.

814
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
They're trying to set us up.

815
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
No, we didn't do anything.

816
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,460
The police let us in and when they let us in, they embedded Antifa and Black Lives Matter

817
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,460
in there.

818
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,460
We're doing this.

819
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,640
We're so strong, but we're the victim.

820
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,000
It's really dumb.

821
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,480
Bunch of fucking cowards.

822
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,220
It's very dumb.

823
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,200
And perhaps so was this.

824
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Who knows?

825
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
That's what I'm saying.

826
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
I want a higher quality of criminal.

827
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,440
I think I've said that before.

828
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,440
Yeah, exactly.

829
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,900
It's just that whole thing of just like, really?

830
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,300
This is who we're up against?

831
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,540
Come on, man.

832
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,540
It is.

833
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,040
This is the shittiest fascism I've ever seen.

834
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,240
Yeah, I bet all of them have been disappointing in the moment.

835
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,440
Yeah, well that's probably true.

836
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,000
I bet over time they take on more of a serious character.

837
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,480
Yeah, I imagine if I went and went back and watched a serious documentary about Mussolini,

838
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,240
they'd be like, look at this fucking idiot.

839
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,080
What are we talking about with this guy?

840
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,080
How did he take over?

841
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
Yeah, probably.

842
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
Yeah, probably.

843
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,240
Anyway, Jordan, I apologize that we don't have a full episode for today, but...

844
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,520
Absolutely, this is a bottle episode.

845
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,560
Battlestar Galactica is over.

846
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,720
It's like that Breaking Bad episode with the fly.

847
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Yeah, exactly.

848
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,280
But the fly is a coach.

849
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,040
The fly is just Dave D'Aubenbier whispering like, hey man, it's gonna happen.

850
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
Would you pass the salt?

851
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
It's gonna happen.

852
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,120
It's just a fly asking for salt.

853
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:40,120
Alright, well, we'll be back on Wednesday with a full-on Alex Jones episode, but until

854
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
then Jordan, we have a website.

855
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
We do have a website.

856
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
It's knowledgefight.com.

857
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
Yep, we're also on Twitter.

858
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,120
We are on Twitter.

859
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,120
It's at knowledgejones.com.

860
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,120
Now go to Matt Jordan.

861
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,120
We're also on Facebook.

862
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,120
We are on Facebook.

863
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,080
If you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

864
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
doing God's work.

865
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,640
Yeah, we'll be back, but until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZXClark, I'm Daryl Rundis,

866
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm the Juiciest Ice Cube.

867
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,360
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air.

868
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,360
Thanks for holding.

869
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,360
Hello, Alex.

870
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
I'm a first time caller.

871
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,360
I'm a huge fan.

872
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
I love your work.

873
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:37,320
I love you.
