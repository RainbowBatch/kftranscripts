N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:19.600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.920
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:23.920 --> 00:24.920
Knowledgefight.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.360
I love you.

00:30.360 --> 00:35.360
Challenge Fight, Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight.

00:35.360 --> 00:42.360
Need money, Andy and Kansys, Andy and Kansys.

00:42.360 --> 00:47.360
Stop it, Andy and Kansys, It's time to pray.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.360
Andy and Kansys you're on the air, thanks for holding me.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.360
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.360
I love your world.

00:53.360 --> 00:54.360
I'm Dan.

00:54.360 --> 00:55.360
I'm Jordan.

00:55.360 --> 01:04.520
We're a couple dudes that like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little

01:04.520 --> 01:05.840
bit about Alex Jones.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.560
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.560
Jordan.

01:08.560 --> 01:09.560
Dan!

01:09.560 --> 01:10.560
Jordan.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.560
Quick question for you.

01:11.560 --> 01:12.560
Yes, sir.

01:12.560 --> 01:13.560
What's your bright spot today?

01:13.560 --> 01:14.560
My bright spot today is I'm talking into a new microphone.

01:14.560 --> 01:15.560
Oh, that's right.

01:15.560 --> 01:16.560
We are talking to a new microphone.

01:16.560 --> 01:17.560
They look the same.

01:17.560 --> 01:18.560
I completely forgot.

01:18.560 --> 01:19.560
Exactly the same.

01:19.560 --> 01:20.560
They're the same.

01:20.560 --> 01:21.560
Still cheap as a pad microphone.

01:21.560 --> 01:22.560
Yep.

01:22.560 --> 01:23.560
But they're new.

01:23.560 --> 01:28.320
I noticed some poppling and crackling in a couple of our recent episodes.

01:28.320 --> 01:32.920
I decided it was time to get at least new cords, and man, this new windscreen feels

01:32.920 --> 01:34.600
good on my face.

01:34.600 --> 01:35.600
It does.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.860
It's much smoother.

01:37.860 --> 01:41.880
It doesn't have years of other people's faces on it.

01:41.880 --> 01:42.880
Yeah, pre-COVID.

01:42.880 --> 01:43.880
Pre-COVID, other people's faces.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.800
You're the only one who's touched it since then.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.400
For four years, we're the only ones who've touched it, yes.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.600
Yeah, it's nice though.

01:51.600 --> 02:00.320
I bought a desk mic stand as well, but it does not attach to the mic holder, so I still

02:00.320 --> 02:09.400
have some work to do on that, but yeah, it's my weekend warrior type project for today.

02:09.400 --> 02:10.400
I love it.

02:10.400 --> 02:11.400
How about you?

02:11.400 --> 02:23.520
Similar weekend warrior type project, Dan, I have for probably 13 years lived in apartments,

02:23.520 --> 02:26.960
in apartment buildings with people around me.

02:26.960 --> 02:33.160
And so when I left for apartment living, I also left my drum set behind.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.760
I miss it.

02:34.760 --> 02:36.440
Your guy likes to throw some sticks around.

02:36.440 --> 02:43.120
I played drums since I was like eight years old, and then I had to stop at 19 for the

02:43.120 --> 02:45.320
aforementioned reasons.

02:45.320 --> 02:51.880
And it has been difficult, and finally I realized that you can get an electric drum kit for

02:51.880 --> 02:53.800
like 300 bucks.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.800
So I got one.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.800
Wow.

02:55.800 --> 02:56.800
And it's fantastic.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.960
Wow, how about that?

02:57.960 --> 02:58.960
It's very cheap.

02:58.960 --> 02:59.960
It's garbage.

02:59.960 --> 03:00.960
I'm going to break it in a week.

03:00.960 --> 03:01.960
Yeah.

03:01.960 --> 03:02.960
It's going to be like when I played rock band.

03:02.960 --> 03:03.960
Yeah, exactly.

03:03.960 --> 03:04.960
Exactly.

03:04.960 --> 03:05.960
Just destroying those pads.

03:05.960 --> 03:06.960
Yeah.

03:06.960 --> 03:07.960
I'm going to die to death.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.440
But it is so good to get back to drums.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.320
Somehow it's still going to be too loud for your partner.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.320
Totally.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.320
She's still going to be like, keep it down.

03:14.320 --> 03:21.240
Well, I've also, here's the weekend warrior, the last time that I tried having a conversation

03:21.240 --> 03:25.280
while she was at work, our rooms share a wall.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.280
Right, right.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.280
And I am me.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.280
Loud.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.280
Loud.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.880
And I have a tendency to toss language about in jest.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.800
Not to fit for the classroom.

03:34.800 --> 03:35.800
No.

03:35.800 --> 03:42.520
Her high school students have heard me speak, so I bought some soundproofing shit, so my

03:42.520 --> 03:46.320
entire room is going to be turned into a studio, essentially.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.320
Good luck with that.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.760
Soundproofing is kind of tough unless you can get inside the walls.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.280
Yeah, I'm working on it.

03:51.280 --> 03:52.280
Well, that's fun.

03:52.280 --> 03:56.320
I hope you have some nice fun Dave Grohl-esque drumming adventures in your future.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.320
Love it.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.480
Hey, who hasn't played along to Queens of the Stone Age songs for the dead?

04:00.480 --> 04:02.160
I have, only on rock band.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.160
Yeah.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.160
But see what I'm saying?

04:04.160 --> 04:05.160
You're not even a drummer and you've played along with it.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.000
You've never played Everlong on rock band.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.040
Well, that one's fairly easy.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.040
Not on expert.

04:10.040 --> 04:14.880
Yeah, you don't know your sixteenth notes, brah?

04:14.880 --> 04:15.880
No, I don't.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.680
It's very fast.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.680
My foot gets tired.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.440
I miss rock band.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.960
You let the sticks do the work.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.600
That's what a lot of people don't know about drums.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.840
You think you gotta hit it with your arm.

04:26.840 --> 04:27.840
You just move your wrist up a little bit.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.920
You say that and it's like a cryptic mystery or something.

04:29.920 --> 04:30.920
No, it's not a mystery.

04:30.920 --> 04:31.920
You let the sticks do the work.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.120
You let the sticks do the work, Dan.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.120
I don't know.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.760
I loved rock band.

04:37.760 --> 04:46.640
I spent hours, hours trying to 100% helter-skelter on expert.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.280
I don't think I ever succeeded.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.280
You never succeeded.

04:49.280 --> 04:53.420
I think I tried it hundreds and hundreds of times because you get an achievement in Beatles

04:53.420 --> 04:57.080
rock band if you're 100% on expert.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.800
I just couldn't get it.

04:58.800 --> 04:59.800
Couldn't get it.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.800
Couldn't do it, huh?

05:00.800 --> 05:01.800
Ringo, gotcha.

05:01.800 --> 05:02.800
Yep.

05:02.800 --> 05:07.080
The classic drummer that throws people on.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.080
Look.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.080
I'm sorry.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.080
I'm sorry.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.160
A lot of the other songs are pretty easy, but helter-skelter is a little complex.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.160
Sure, sure.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.120
I'm also not very good at rhythm based stuff.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.120
No, that's fine.

05:17.120 --> 05:20.080
I'm sorry if I... I don't mean to make fun of you.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.080
I'm just a bully.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.080
I'm a bad person.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.080
That's all right.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.080
I'm sorry.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.080
It's okay.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.080
Okay.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.880
So, Jordan, today we got an interesting thing on our plates in front of us and that is that

05:29.880 --> 05:32.360
we don't really have an episode.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.560
That is an interesting thing on our plates.

05:34.560 --> 05:35.560
Yeah.

05:35.560 --> 05:36.560
So, here's what happened.

05:36.560 --> 05:37.560
What's that?

05:37.560 --> 05:40.600
I did not want to do another episode for today about Alex.

05:40.600 --> 05:44.680
I wanted to push that to Wednesday because I needed personally a break from him.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.280
I was tired of his bullshit.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.320
Last week was emotionally exhausting.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.320
Yeah.

05:49.320 --> 05:56.280
Starting on the preparation for Friday's episode on the 8th straight through to present, it's

05:56.280 --> 05:57.280
been a lot.

05:57.280 --> 06:02.280
It's been a lot of stuff that I grow weary of and then at the same time the payoff of

06:02.280 --> 06:07.200
the interview with Steve Pechenik on our last episode was almost two.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.480
It was season ending.

06:08.480 --> 06:09.480
Yeah.

06:09.480 --> 06:12.000
It felt like it was a fucking season finale.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.120
We got CVPs giving us the fucking cliffhanger.

06:16.120 --> 06:17.120
And telling Alex to his face.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.120
When is he going to come back?

06:19.120 --> 06:20.120
Yeah.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.520
I have been lying to you for 20 years.

06:22.520 --> 06:27.560
I decided to anoint you as the vehicle by which I would set off a military coup.

06:27.560 --> 06:28.560
Wait.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.560
Hold on.

06:29.560 --> 06:30.560
Hold on, doc.

06:30.560 --> 06:31.560
I have been the puppet master.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.560
Yeah.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.560
You think you're in control.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.560
No, sir.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.560
Hi.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.560
Yeah.

06:36.560 --> 06:39.440
There's something about that that was so satisfying and narratively interesting to

06:39.440 --> 06:44.600
me that I found myself having a really tough time going back to Alex.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.600
Yeah.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.600
And I know it'll be temporary.

06:46.600 --> 06:51.600
I'll be able to get back on the horse soon, but I sat down to try and listen to other

06:51.600 --> 06:54.000
episodes and I just like, I can't do this.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Yeah.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.840
And so what I wanted to do, naturally in times like this in the past, what we've done is

06:58.840 --> 07:02.800
we've gone to various other online space weirdos.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.800
Sure.

07:03.800 --> 07:04.800
Yeah.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.800
If we could.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.400
And so yeah, I checked in on Carrie Cassidy over at Project Camelot and she had a video

07:09.400 --> 07:11.640
the day after the storming of the Capitol.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.360
She's on some Q bullshit for 100.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.360
You bet.

07:14.360 --> 07:15.360
Yeah.

07:15.360 --> 07:19.880
100% zero, zero possibility that that wasn't going to happen.

07:19.880 --> 07:20.880
No.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.800
I got really bored listening to that too because aliens weren't in play.

07:23.800 --> 07:24.800
Yeah.

07:24.800 --> 07:25.800
Why would it, what did you say?

07:25.800 --> 07:28.360
Get the fuck out of Q and get back into space, lady.

07:28.360 --> 07:33.480
I did find out from listening to this, but it wasn't worth getting too deep into.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.040
There's apparently an Archon alien, a singular one.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.040
Okay.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.040
Just one.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.040
That runs the CIA.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.040
Okay.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.040
It did not know that.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.040
All right.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.040
Okay.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.040
I didn't learn that.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.040
Okay.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.040
And it used to be this guy Archon, right?

07:47.040 --> 07:48.040
Right.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.540
But I think Carrie has some intelligence that he might have died and now there's a female

07:49.540 --> 07:51.320
Archon that's in charge of the CIA.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.320
All right.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.320
Unclear.

07:53.320 --> 07:54.920
Prove that he's dead and not a shape shifter.

07:54.920 --> 07:55.920
Can't do it.

07:55.920 --> 07:56.920
Yeah.

07:56.920 --> 07:57.920
Can't do it.

07:57.920 --> 07:58.920
Yeah.

07:58.920 --> 07:59.920
Yeah.

07:59.920 --> 08:00.920
Carrie, bring it to me.

08:00.920 --> 08:06.280
So then I was like, well, I bet Jim Baker's disappointed and I still don't like talking

08:06.280 --> 08:07.280
about Jim Baker.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.280
I don't know why.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.640
I just don't, it still makes me a little bit uncomfortable.

08:11.640 --> 08:12.640
Yeah.

08:12.640 --> 08:13.640
Yeah.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.040
I think that I'm not going to be able to go back to that well ever.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.160
Eh, fuck Jim Baker.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.320
I just, I don't, what is he going to say?

08:18.320 --> 08:19.320
God does shit.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.320
Well, we moved on.

08:20.320 --> 08:23.120
Talk about how great his big ass bucket of oatmeal is.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.920
You and I have both read the Bible and eaten survival food.

08:25.920 --> 08:26.920
We can just move on.

08:26.920 --> 08:27.920
Yeah.

08:27.920 --> 08:28.920
Yeah.

08:28.920 --> 08:32.000
So then of course I, I was, I was kind of like in a bind.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.760
I was like, I don't know what I'm going to do.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.600
Got to get something together.

08:35.600 --> 08:42.120
And then I remembered that when I was looking at pictures of the Capitol on the sixth, yeah,

08:42.120 --> 08:48.240
I saw somebody wearing a pass the salt shirt, which of course is the name of Dave Dobenmeyer,

08:48.240 --> 08:49.240
coach Dave.

08:49.240 --> 08:54.680
It's the name of his radio ministry, his YouTube broadcast ministry.

08:54.680 --> 08:55.680
Pass the salt.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.680
I saw that.

08:56.680 --> 09:02.840
I was like, whoa, there's Dave Dobenmeyer shirts at the protest at the people storming

09:02.840 --> 09:03.840
there at the Capitol.

09:03.840 --> 09:04.840
Yeah.

09:04.840 --> 09:05.840
Yeah.

09:05.840 --> 09:06.840
Was he there?

09:06.840 --> 09:07.840
That would be amazing.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.160
Who else is wearing a Dave Dobenmeyer shirt?

09:10.160 --> 09:11.160
Well, it wasn't him.

09:11.160 --> 09:12.800
I would have recognized him in the picture.

09:12.800 --> 09:13.800
Okay.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.720
But I was like, coach Dave had to have been there, right?

09:16.720 --> 09:18.280
And so I went and I checked.

09:18.280 --> 09:19.280
Sure.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.280
Dave Dobenmeyer was at the Capitol.

09:20.280 --> 09:22.480
He could not possibly have been there.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.480
Really?

09:23.480 --> 09:24.480
He was at the Capitol.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.480
Dave Dobenmeyer decided to go storm the Capitol.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.480
Coach Dave.

09:27.480 --> 09:28.480
Son of a bitch.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.480
Yeah.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.280
He led the football team in through.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.840
I can't come up with a metaphor.

09:33.840 --> 09:38.000
Hey guys, win one for the Gipper.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.680
So today I wanted to take a little bit of a look at that, but it's not really much of

09:41.680 --> 09:42.680
an episode.

09:42.680 --> 09:50.120
I wasted a lot of time watching these streams for what will ultimately be kind of, I don't

09:50.120 --> 09:51.880
know, a little bit deflating.

09:51.880 --> 09:57.320
It's not going to be, look, if you like our show, tune back in on Wednesday.

09:57.320 --> 10:00.600
We will have a full episode if you're expecting that.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.320
But we're going to listen to a little bit of Dave Dobenmeyer.

10:04.320 --> 10:08.820
What if an episode of like Battlestar Galactica was like, hey guys, this is a bottle episode.

10:08.820 --> 10:10.920
We couldn't afford to really do much here.

10:10.920 --> 10:17.920
Listen, if you want to see some space shit, come back next week.

10:17.920 --> 10:24.540
So one of the things that I thought was really funny is on the sixth, Dave is, uh, coach

10:24.540 --> 10:31.400
is a recording, uh, and doing a live stream from the Metro, from the train in DC.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.320
So it's a little bit iffy, the sound is not great.

10:34.320 --> 10:39.400
The connection is eh, but one of the things that he does that I think is really maybe

10:39.400 --> 10:45.020
unfortunate in hindsight is he literally doxes every single person who's on that train with

10:45.020 --> 10:47.320
him going to DC.

10:47.320 --> 10:53.120
Like if any of them went in the Capitol, his broadcast could be identifying information.

10:53.120 --> 10:56.440
It will, it's look, it's obvious.

10:56.440 --> 11:01.400
This was always going to be the case that this would happen, but the fact that the people

11:01.400 --> 11:08.360
most afraid of Bill Gates tracking them all the time have docked themselves so completely.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.880
It's just, it's never not going to be obvious.

11:10.880 --> 11:14.480
He's just going around like, Oh, this is Greg from Idaho.

11:14.480 --> 11:15.480
Totally.

11:15.480 --> 11:16.480
Totally.

11:16.480 --> 11:17.480
Yeah.

11:17.480 --> 11:18.480
Don't do this.

11:18.480 --> 11:19.480
Oh man.

11:19.480 --> 11:20.480
I love it.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.480
Yup.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.480
Yup.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.720
So, uh, Dave gets to, gets to talking about how many people they're going to be there.

11:24.720 --> 11:29.040
I do like how it seems the only people who are uninterested in doxing each other are

11:29.040 --> 11:30.260
Antifa.

11:30.260 --> 11:34.300
They're the only people who are like, Hey, if you're going to video people, don't put

11:34.300 --> 11:36.560
their face in it or say their real names.

11:36.560 --> 11:39.560
Everybody else is like, I'd love to be on TV.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.560
Yeah.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.880
Here's my social security number.

11:41.880 --> 11:42.880
Exactly.

11:42.880 --> 11:43.880
Are you from Nigeria?

11:43.880 --> 11:46.640
I met a guy once.

11:46.640 --> 11:51.360
So he gets to talking about how there's going to be so many people there.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.760
And this is, this is big.

11:52.760 --> 11:59.360
This is not just a protest from what I, what I saw Dale, 4 million, they said there's possibly

11:59.360 --> 12:05.240
4 million people that are going to be here in downtown Washington, DC, very, very strong,

12:05.240 --> 12:06.240
powerful message.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.880
And most of the people have not come just to chant for more years.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.080
No, I don't think so, coach.

12:12.080 --> 12:16.520
I think it's, it's far beyond that once again, Donald Trump is not going to call.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.680
He called for this rally.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.800
He has a platform at nine this morning.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.280
I believe he is going to talk.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.000
He's not, it's not a pep rally.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.040
I do not believe this is game on.

12:27.040 --> 12:31.360
Remember we talked about, you know, we always have 11 men on offense and 11 men on defense

12:31.360 --> 12:32.440
in the field.

12:32.440 --> 12:37.840
This is like, this is like the, the coach turning to the stadium and saying, get on

12:37.840 --> 12:38.840
the field.

12:38.840 --> 12:44.840
Now's the time I think I might be feeling inspired to write a book, your honor exhibit

12:44.840 --> 12:45.840
eight.

12:45.840 --> 12:50.820
I feel like there'll be, there's a great book to be written about like all of the right

12:50.820 --> 12:56.640
wing media stuff prior to the Capitol storming called this looks bad in hindsight.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.680
Yeah, totally, totally.

12:58.680 --> 13:02.360
But ultimately the thing that's really interesting about it is it's not really that different

13:02.360 --> 13:03.880
than the way they talk normally.

13:03.880 --> 13:10.920
You know, it's, it's pretty much hubris, a Nazi tale.

13:10.920 --> 13:15.560
So there's a guy on the bus there and Dave goes around and he, he, he checks in on the

13:15.560 --> 13:17.200
temperature of the people in the crowd.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.200
Sure.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.200
Hey, how are you doing?

13:19.200 --> 13:20.200
Hey, how are you doing?

13:20.200 --> 13:21.200
Yeah.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.200
Yeah.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.200
Yeah.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.200
And this guy says it's now or never.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.200
Well, I'll tell you what, it's time.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.200
We stand up.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.200
This is it for our country.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.200
I'd say either now or never.

13:28.200 --> 13:35.040
I've enjoyed the blessings of the United States of America for 74 years.

13:35.040 --> 13:39.640
And I, I just don't want to see it go basically to the communists.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.640
That's what we're looking at.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.080
We've got to hand it off to our children.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.080
It's our children, grandchildren.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.080
That's it.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.080
Yeah, man.

13:45.080 --> 13:48.320
The commies, they're coming and it's now or never, you got to stand up and fight these

13:48.320 --> 13:52.840
commies or else your grandkids aren't going to have a capitalist country to live in and

13:52.840 --> 13:54.000
have a great time with.

13:54.000 --> 14:01.400
I like, I like the real low tier of these guys because I recognize how they talk and

14:01.400 --> 14:06.000
that is exactly like comedy producers who have never put on a good show.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Hmm.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.960
I think we're going to have about 4 million people here tonight.

14:08.960 --> 14:09.960
Oh yes.

14:09.960 --> 14:10.960
Yeah.

14:10.960 --> 14:11.960
That is, that is awesome.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.800
I think we're going to have so many people here tonight.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.400
I'm telling you, I've heard, I got so many Facebook messages.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.440
People are committed to showing up.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.440
Yeah.

14:20.440 --> 14:21.440
You should have been here last week.

14:21.440 --> 14:24.560
Oh, well actually it was going to be 4 million, but it rained.

14:24.560 --> 14:25.560
Yeah.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.560
Exactly.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.560
Yeah.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.560
Oh, I forgot that there was a Bears game today.

14:28.560 --> 14:29.560
Yeah, exactly.

14:29.560 --> 14:30.560
Yeah.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.560
Yeah.

14:31.560 --> 14:32.560
Yeah.

14:32.560 --> 14:33.560
Oh no.

14:33.560 --> 14:34.560
It's Sunday.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.560
There's always a good one.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.560
Yes, exactly.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.560
Your show is weekly on Sundays.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.760
You got to know there's football.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.960
Got to know there's football, man.

14:42.960 --> 14:48.080
Um, so yeah, they are a little bit, uh, there's a little bit of pride or a little bit of expectation

14:48.080 --> 14:49.680
and excitement.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.040
It's definitely palpable.

14:51.040 --> 14:56.840
You can tell like they feel like they're getting ready to go do something more than chant for

14:56.840 --> 14:57.840
more years.

14:57.840 --> 14:58.840
Yes.

14:58.840 --> 14:59.840
Yeah.

14:59.840 --> 15:00.840
For sure.

15:00.840 --> 15:01.840
Yeah.

15:01.840 --> 15:02.840
The electricity was clearly in the air.

15:02.840 --> 15:03.840
Yeah.

15:03.840 --> 15:04.840
Yeah.

15:04.840 --> 15:08.520
And, and, and, and interestingly, I mean, I think that, um, the people who are there

15:08.520 --> 15:13.000
have a lot more to say than just that Biden stole the election.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.960
Um, there's certainly some ideas that are being trafficked on this bus that are interesting.

15:19.960 --> 15:20.960
Great ideas.

15:20.960 --> 15:21.960
Any highfalutin ideas?

15:21.960 --> 15:28.640
Clyde's going to tell us how to become a citizen of our local state's revenue.

15:28.640 --> 15:36.160
Actually what you're doing is you're moving from the admiralty and a jurisdiction of the

15:36.160 --> 15:40.280
sea to the jurisdiction of the land and the soil.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.840
And it's just very simple.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.360
You just remove yourself.

15:44.360 --> 15:50.340
You go through the process of the paperwork to remove yourself as a U S citizen and become

15:50.340 --> 15:52.400
a citizen of the state you were born in.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.400
Sure.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.200
And join the assembly of states in your state.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.200
That sounds right.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.560
And then you become a state national or a state citizen.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.560
Oh, of course.

15:59.560 --> 16:05.240
There are rumors that Trump is a state national and has already gone through this and understands

16:05.240 --> 16:07.000
all of this.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.320
And what we have to do, we've talked about succeeding.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.880
We don't need to succeed our states.

16:11.880 --> 16:17.680
We need to succeed ourselves one at a time and move over to the land jurisdiction.

16:17.680 --> 16:22.360
And what we're doing right now is thanks to judge Anna von Reitz.

16:22.360 --> 16:27.240
She's done all the paperwork so that we're now right now are repopulating the original

16:27.240 --> 16:29.720
constitution of 1787.

16:29.720 --> 16:33.600
So I think Anna von Reitz, if I recall correctly, is somebody that I've heard Carrie Cassidy

16:33.600 --> 16:34.600
bring up quite a bit.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.560
So there's a nice little overlap.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.560
Sure.

16:37.560 --> 16:38.560
Of that.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.560
Yeah.

16:39.560 --> 16:42.080
I wrote in a scream.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.080
I wrote in a scream.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.080
Yeah.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.080
Yeah.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.800
That's why we're in the room, can't tell those are big old letters.

16:47.800 --> 16:48.800
Those are big old letters.

16:48.800 --> 16:49.800
What do we got there?

16:49.800 --> 16:59.920
He just basically said, all right, that the president that they love most is not an American

16:59.920 --> 17:00.920
citizen.

17:00.920 --> 17:01.920
Yeah, that is a problem with his theory.

17:01.920 --> 17:02.920
Yeah.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.080
But that's because sovereign citizens are higher up on the ladder.

17:05.080 --> 17:09.960
So you're going to come at me with Obama wasn't born here and then you're going to tell me

17:09.960 --> 17:12.080
that your president isn't even American?

17:12.080 --> 17:13.080
Well.

17:13.080 --> 17:14.880
Get the fuck out of here.

17:14.880 --> 17:15.880
Paper American.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.120
What is that even?

17:17.120 --> 17:18.760
Constitution of 1870.

17:18.760 --> 17:19.760
Sure.

17:19.760 --> 17:20.760
Sure.

17:20.760 --> 17:21.760
Sure.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.420
That's all just QAnon sovereign citizen shit.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.420
It's a bummer.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.500
It's a real bummer.

17:27.500 --> 17:34.080
It's amazing to me how important paperwork is to these people and how unimportant reading

17:34.080 --> 17:35.080
is.

17:35.080 --> 17:36.080
Yeah.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.080
Yeah.

17:37.080 --> 17:41.080
It's fun too because you know, you got Dave here, coach Dave on the bus and he's having

17:41.080 --> 17:44.400
this guy explain how you become a citizen of the land.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.400
Yeah.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.040
You got to take your away from the admiralty.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.720
And he's not like, I don't know about that, man.

17:49.720 --> 17:53.960
He's like, oh great, I can't wait to have you on the show again and talk more about

17:53.960 --> 17:54.960
this.

17:54.960 --> 17:55.960
Yeah.

17:55.960 --> 17:56.960
What?

17:56.960 --> 17:57.960
So good.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.360
But look, this guy knows what he's talking about.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.160
I think he went to law school.

18:01.160 --> 18:05.480
So our whole movement, I believe, is going to be about teaching people how to get out

18:05.480 --> 18:09.640
of the jurisdiction of the admiralty law and the law of the sea and the Vatican, which

18:09.640 --> 18:11.160
is the law of the air.

18:11.160 --> 18:15.520
The law comes from L-A-W, land, air, water.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.680
That's where the word law comes from.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.480
The three jurisdictions.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.920
The Pope figured this out in 1300.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.560
That's who we're living under right now.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.560
The Vatican.

18:24.560 --> 18:25.560
The same pope?

18:25.560 --> 18:26.560
All of this is under that.

18:26.560 --> 18:32.080
The only way to get out of it is to go and land in soil and get back under the constitution

18:32.080 --> 18:33.480
of 1787.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.480
Sure.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.140
Land, air, water.

18:36.140 --> 18:37.420
That's what law means.

18:37.420 --> 18:38.480
Are we doing this?

18:38.480 --> 18:39.840
Are we doing this, Dan?

18:39.840 --> 18:40.840
We're not.

18:40.840 --> 18:44.480
The Vatican is the law of the air.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.480
Right.

18:45.480 --> 18:49.600
And then I think the British empire is the law of the sea.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.600
Sure.

18:50.600 --> 18:53.800
The maritime law is under the British common admiralty law.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.800
Sure.

18:54.800 --> 18:55.800
Sure.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.080
And then I guess the land is just everybody.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.080
The land is freedom.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.600
The land is just the constitution of the United States.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.600
Freedom.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.600
Yeah.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.760
But not the United States, individual states.

19:05.760 --> 19:06.760
Right.

19:06.760 --> 19:09.240
Because we're also the articles of people?

19:09.240 --> 19:12.220
Does this apply to people in other countries?

19:12.220 --> 19:14.440
Like the law of the ground?

19:14.440 --> 19:17.680
The Vatican owns their air, so they don't have any choice.

19:17.680 --> 19:21.400
See, the pope figured this out in 1300.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.400
Figured what out?

19:22.400 --> 19:24.680
That law means land, air, and water.

19:24.680 --> 19:30.240
In what language?

19:30.240 --> 19:31.240
It's not spelled that way.

19:31.240 --> 19:32.240
Oh man.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.240
All right.

19:33.240 --> 19:38.120
Earth, fire, water, air, long ago.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.120
My father.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.120
Was the avatar.

19:40.120 --> 19:41.120
Talk about elements.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.120
Oh man.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.120
J.K. Simmons.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.120
Fantastic!

19:44.120 --> 19:47.360
Elements equal jurisdictions.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.120
You ever fuck with Avatar, Dan?

19:49.120 --> 19:50.120
No.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.440
Not the Cameron bullshit.

19:51.440 --> 19:56.200
I'm talking about young boy with air powers.

19:56.200 --> 20:01.280
I watched the James Cameron movie because I was brought along to it by friends who insisted

20:01.280 --> 20:02.280
I go see it.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.280
That was a terrible idea.

20:03.280 --> 20:04.280
No, wait.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.280
That's Serenity.

20:05.280 --> 20:06.280
Serenity's great.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.240
But I also saw Avatar because it was too big to not see.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.240
Well.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.560
You know, it was one of those things that like, you gotta-

20:10.560 --> 20:14.160
You didn't see the last, the Rise of Skywalker.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.160
I'm an adult.

20:16.160 --> 20:18.520
It's a joke.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.800
There was a time when that came out, I was of the age where it's like, yeah, you gotta

20:21.800 --> 20:22.800
see this.

20:22.800 --> 20:23.800
Well, sure.

20:23.800 --> 20:24.800
People are going to be talking about it.

20:24.800 --> 20:25.800
Yes.

20:25.800 --> 20:26.800
And I don't care about that now.

20:26.800 --> 20:27.800
No.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.520
So, I think I did see the last Skywalker.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.520
You did not.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.520
I think I did.

20:31.520 --> 20:32.520
When?

20:32.520 --> 20:33.520
When?

20:33.520 --> 20:34.520
Tell me when.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.720
When did you get it on DVD, Dan?

20:36.720 --> 20:37.720
Yeah.

20:37.720 --> 20:38.720
It's under the red box.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.920
No, I think I did see it though.

20:41.920 --> 20:42.920
We'll deal with this later.

20:42.920 --> 20:43.920
Okay.

20:43.920 --> 20:44.920
Okay.

20:44.920 --> 20:45.920
Anyway, there's three jurisdictions.

20:45.920 --> 20:46.920
Sure, sure.

20:46.920 --> 20:47.920
Law.

20:47.920 --> 20:48.920
Okay.

20:48.920 --> 20:52.280
We're all under, wait, he's saying that we're under maritime law, but apparently the Vatican,

20:52.280 --> 20:53.280
that's air law.

20:53.280 --> 20:56.200
Yeah, I would like to- That's avian law.

20:56.200 --> 21:02.560
Before we go any further, in any conversation with this guy, I want to know exactly the

21:02.560 --> 21:03.560
laws of air.

21:03.560 --> 21:04.560
Mm-hmm.

21:04.560 --> 21:08.200
I want to know what air law is that the pope has control over.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.200
Yeah.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.680
If I were to go any further in this conversation with this guy, which I wouldn't, here's how

21:13.680 --> 21:14.680
I would go.

21:14.680 --> 21:15.680
What's over there?

21:15.680 --> 21:16.680
And I just walk.

21:16.680 --> 21:17.680
Smoke bomb.

21:17.680 --> 21:21.800
I had a friend who really perfected that move, like pretending that he saw something somewhere

21:21.800 --> 21:22.800
else- Oh, really?

21:22.800 --> 21:23.800
And just would walk off.

21:23.800 --> 21:27.160
I really admired the hell out of his ability to get away from things.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.320
You know, I've done that many times.

21:29.320 --> 21:33.760
You know you get into those party conversations where it's four people and the three of them

21:33.760 --> 21:38.160
start having a conversation and you're like, I want to jump in, but it's just not going

21:38.160 --> 21:39.400
to happen.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.120
You look over and you're like, oh my God.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.240
And then you just walk away.

21:42.240 --> 21:43.240
You saw a friend.

21:43.240 --> 21:44.240
Yeah.

21:44.240 --> 21:45.240
Yeah.

21:45.240 --> 21:49.080
I think the key to pulling that off perfectly is that you have to end up somewhere that's

21:49.080 --> 21:51.960
not in direct eye shot of the people you just left.

21:51.960 --> 21:52.960
Sure.

21:52.960 --> 21:53.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:53.960 --> 21:54.960
Because otherwise you're just going to be milling around over there.

21:54.960 --> 21:55.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:55.960 --> 21:56.960
Yeah.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.480
Anyway, Dave has heard that there's a lot to be worried about.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.280
There's a lot of threats- Sure.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.280
On the ground.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.280
There's like Antifa and what have you.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.280
Yeah.

22:04.280 --> 22:05.280
All right.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.280
He's not worried about any of that shit.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.480
I'm not worried that they may have bricks down there that they're going to throw at

22:08.480 --> 22:09.480
us.

22:09.480 --> 22:12.200
I'm not worried that they're going to shoot pepper spray at us.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.160
I'm not worried that the governor is going to call in this person and the mayor is going

22:15.160 --> 22:16.160
to call in this.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.160
I'm not worried about any of that stuff.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.160
Huh?

22:18.160 --> 22:19.160
We're at war.

22:19.160 --> 22:20.160
We're going to war.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.520
We're prepared for war, spiritual war.

22:21.520 --> 22:24.360
But if the physical war breaks out, there's going to be 4 million of us.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.360
They better have a bunch.

22:25.360 --> 22:30.360
They better have a bunch of people because this is a boiling-

22:30.360 --> 22:36.360
Well, here's a true work of authority.

22:36.360 --> 22:40.800
The mayor of D.C. has no military authority, not over the National Guard or anything.

22:40.800 --> 22:47.560
All she has is D.C. police and guess what, D.C. police will step, they will step aside.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.040
There's too many of them.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.760
So this doesn't look good in hindsight.

22:51.760 --> 22:55.680
Well, well, well, well.

22:55.680 --> 23:02.560
These sort of conversations certainly seem to be pre-, pre-, pre-, what would you call

23:02.560 --> 23:03.560
that?

23:03.560 --> 23:04.560
What's the right word I'm looking for?

23:04.560 --> 23:05.840
Uh, premeditated?

23:05.840 --> 23:06.840
Is that a way to go?

23:06.840 --> 23:14.240
I mean, it's very much like, oh, you know, like, if you accept the idea that like, oh,

23:14.240 --> 23:18.800
they kind of are planning on fucking storming the Capitol, you'd kind of be like, oh yeah,

23:18.800 --> 23:21.200
this is the kind of conversation you'd expect to hear before that.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.200
Before you storm the Capitol.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.520
Hey, look, hey, we don't want any trouble, but if there's trouble, there's four million

23:26.520 --> 23:29.760
of us and the cops are on our side, so what the fuck?

23:29.760 --> 23:33.600
If the Capitol was the Constitution, these assholes are the preamble.

23:33.600 --> 23:37.740
Yeah, preamble was probably one of the words I was trying to look for, and I just couldn't

23:37.740 --> 23:41.220
figure out a way to make it work grammatically.

23:41.220 --> 23:47.480
So there's, there's these Capitol police, sure, and there's not enough of them, man.

23:47.480 --> 23:48.800
There's just not enough.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.640
There's not enough to stop Dave.

23:50.640 --> 23:56.240
Hey Dale, how many policemen would you say there are in, in, uh, DC?

23:56.240 --> 23:58.760
I'm just going to throw out another thousand.

23:58.760 --> 23:59.760
Yeah.

23:59.760 --> 24:06.160
You know, listen, Jefferson parish, Jefferson parish, we have, we have 1500 officers that

24:06.160 --> 24:10.720
not just officers, people who work in the desk and detectives and everything.

24:10.720 --> 24:13.680
And that's for a population of a half a million people.

24:13.680 --> 24:17.440
I don't necessarily know if they can have a thousand in DC.

24:17.440 --> 24:18.440
Here's my point.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.560
Do they have enough to push back?

24:20.560 --> 24:25.720
What if, uh, 500,000 people said they'd had enough of what if just, what if just 10%,

24:25.720 --> 24:30.040
what if 200,000 people said they had enough and decided they were going to storm the Capitol?

24:30.040 --> 24:33.120
I don't know if they're going to, I don't know if they're going to, what, what if that

24:33.120 --> 24:34.120
were to happen, folks?

24:34.120 --> 24:37.000
We don't have any idea what might break loose here.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.560
Now we, none of us want violence.

24:38.560 --> 24:44.080
None of us are advocating violence, but the truth of the matter is there's violence all

24:44.080 --> 24:45.080
around it.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.800
The Bible says that the kingdom of God suffers violence in the days of John the Baptist until

24:48.800 --> 24:52.960
now, the kingdom of God has suffered violence and violent men have taken up by force.

24:52.960 --> 24:55.520
See, listen, it's not the violence, it's the force.

24:55.520 --> 24:58.680
They're forcing us to take vaccinations.

24:58.680 --> 25:01.180
They're forcing us to close our shops.

25:01.180 --> 25:03.040
They're forcing us to not travel.

25:03.040 --> 25:06.320
They're forcing us to not go visit our parents in nursing homes.

25:06.320 --> 25:07.320
They're forced.

25:07.320 --> 25:08.320
You understand?

25:08.320 --> 25:09.320
Do you understand this?

25:09.320 --> 25:12.240
It's the same argumentation style that you hear from folks.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.240
Like we don't want trouble.

25:13.240 --> 25:18.020
We don't want any kind of violence, but all violence that could be seen as offensive is

25:18.020 --> 25:22.500
secretly defensive because they want to give me a vaccine.

25:22.500 --> 25:28.000
It's not great to hear this from someone who's presumably a religious leader.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.720
I would argue that spreading a disease is violence, Dan.

25:32.720 --> 25:34.820
Offensive violence.

25:34.820 --> 25:38.920
There's an interesting argument that you could make with that.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.240
And it seems like they are doing it.

25:40.240 --> 25:45.920
I would actually maybe, yeah, you'd want to probably have some qualification for like

25:45.920 --> 25:46.920
negligence.

25:46.920 --> 25:47.920
Sure.

25:47.920 --> 25:48.920
Or something.

25:48.920 --> 25:49.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.120
Unless you're spitting on people.

25:51.120 --> 25:52.120
And then it's...

25:52.120 --> 25:53.120
Well, there's that.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.120
Then you're out of line.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.120
Eh, I don't know.

25:55.120 --> 25:59.760
If you're aware that wearing a mask can save somebody else's life, and you're like, I'm

25:59.760 --> 26:03.040
never wearing a mask, you have now committed violence.

26:03.040 --> 26:05.240
Yes, but how do you prove that the person actually believes...

26:05.240 --> 26:09.920
Even under your own libertarian nonsense, no, yeah, fuck off.

26:09.920 --> 26:15.120
But you would have to then prove that the person is aware that the masks help.

26:15.120 --> 26:18.320
They believe that, and are choosing to not do it.

26:18.320 --> 26:21.560
Because the denial could be strong.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.140
Sure, sure.

26:23.140 --> 26:26.120
I don't know if I care about denial.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.120
You may not.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.120
The court might, though.

26:28.120 --> 26:31.520
The court might, but it's kind of like a math problem.

26:31.520 --> 26:36.200
Like I don't care if you think that math doesn't work.

26:36.200 --> 26:37.440
It still does.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.160
So you have to live by math.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.160
Right.

26:41.160 --> 26:42.160
Fair enough.

26:42.160 --> 26:48.000
So they spend some more time on this bus, the reception gets bad, and then it goes to

26:48.000 --> 26:54.720
the guy in the studio, and when I say studio, I mean his office, and he's another preacher,

26:54.720 --> 26:59.640
and he just has some people pray and stuff, and I don't care.

26:59.640 --> 27:02.960
Then later, they arrive at the Capitol.

27:02.960 --> 27:08.280
There's at least one picture I saw that was of someone in a Pass the Salt shirt, so they

27:08.280 --> 27:09.280
were around.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.280
All right.

27:10.280 --> 27:15.760
And the D-heads is what I'm calling somebody who wears a Pass the Salt shirt.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.240
Hey, would you pass the salt?

27:17.240 --> 27:23.240
So we get to the next day now, the 7th, and Dave comes on his show, and there's a little

27:23.240 --> 27:25.720
bit of reflection going on.

27:25.720 --> 27:31.160
We are over the target, and as Alex Jones said about 25 years ago, it's an info war.

27:31.160 --> 27:37.120
It's an information war, and boys and girls, we are a dead center target in this information

27:37.120 --> 27:38.120
war.

27:38.120 --> 27:42.840
I'm not trying to... I'm just a fly on the butt of an elephant.

27:42.840 --> 27:46.280
I understand that, but I'm going to tell you something.

27:46.280 --> 27:50.760
We are over the target like we've never been.

27:50.760 --> 27:54.840
So he's just using Alex's language, he's directly referencing Alex.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.920
This dude's just a fucking info warrior.

27:56.920 --> 28:00.360
Man, I don't want to be killed by a bunch of cowards like this.

28:00.360 --> 28:10.000
I don't like the idea that this extremist political anti-communist ideology is being

28:10.000 --> 28:14.840
so successfully marketed under the veil of religion.

28:14.840 --> 28:18.320
I really, really think that that's terrifying.

28:18.320 --> 28:24.600
I would rather be killed in a fight with ISIS, because ISIS is at least like, I want to kill

28:24.600 --> 28:26.000
you.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.360
One of this wishy-washy cowardice from the conservatives just like, I don't want any

28:31.360 --> 28:34.760
violence, but I'm going to have to kill you guys.

28:34.760 --> 28:38.560
And then when violence does happen, whoa, whoa, whoa guys, we didn't ever want... At

28:38.560 --> 28:41.520
least ISIS is like, I'm going to kill you.

28:41.520 --> 28:46.640
There is a... terrorist groups generally do take responsibility for their actions.

28:46.640 --> 28:49.720
Yeah, for shit they didn't even do sometimes.

28:49.720 --> 28:55.720
Well interestingly, Dave has a very similar take on things after the fact that his hero

28:55.720 --> 28:56.720
Alex Jones does.

28:56.720 --> 28:57.720
Strange.

28:57.720 --> 29:00.840
Part of the information war that's going on, and here's going to be your greatest battle

29:00.840 --> 29:05.400
and my greatest battle, is you're going to have to convince the people that you come

29:05.400 --> 29:12.400
in contact with that what happened yesterday in Washington DC wasn't this.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.080
This wasn't what happened.

29:14.080 --> 29:21.760
The storming of the Capitol building, the infiltration of Antifa, BLM, as part of that

29:21.760 --> 29:22.760
infiltration.

29:22.760 --> 29:25.000
Yes, patriots did break through.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.280
They did break through and get into the Capitol building.

29:27.280 --> 29:28.880
Yes, but can I tell you something?

29:28.880 --> 29:30.800
Are you listening to me?

29:30.800 --> 29:31.800
They let us.

29:31.800 --> 29:34.240
Folks, listen to me.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.800
They let us break through.

29:37.800 --> 29:45.880
They let the patriots break through and then embedded BLM in the group.

29:45.880 --> 29:50.460
And all the wicked, crazy stuff that happened inside that Capitol building, that was not

29:50.460 --> 29:52.080
done by patriots, folks.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.280
That was not done.

29:53.280 --> 29:59.480
I love the idea that he's saying on the 7th, it gets suspicious that the cops let them

29:59.480 --> 30:02.640
through when the morning of- On the 6th.

30:02.640 --> 30:04.720
The cops are going to let us through.

30:04.720 --> 30:05.720
Yeah.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.000
It's very strange.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.560
It implies a real change of perspective about like, oh, this actually happened.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.560
Oh shit.

30:12.560 --> 30:13.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:13.560 --> 30:19.080
I just see that so universally with these folks that you look in on.

30:19.080 --> 30:22.640
We got to find a way to not take responsibility for whoever shit on that desk.

30:22.640 --> 30:31.120
If anybody comes at me with like, listen to any conservative in the media now, it's just

30:31.120 --> 30:32.120
no.

30:32.120 --> 30:35.000
What are you talking about?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Don't even.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.680
I can't engage with it.

30:37.680 --> 30:43.400
This was the moment where it's like, no matter what you do, you caused this and then you

30:43.400 --> 30:45.600
disavowed it, so go fuck yourself.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.600
You're a coward.

30:46.600 --> 30:47.600
Uh-huh.

30:47.600 --> 30:48.600
Yeah.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.600
A complete coward.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.880
You're worse than ISIS.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.840
Quite a ride for you in comparing things to ISIS.

30:54.840 --> 30:55.880
I'm enjoying it.

30:55.880 --> 30:58.720
They were good as, they were as evil as ISIS for a while.

30:58.720 --> 30:59.720
It was equivalent.

30:59.720 --> 31:00.720
Now they're worse.

31:00.720 --> 31:01.720
Wow.

31:01.720 --> 31:02.720
Yeah, it's bad.

31:02.720 --> 31:06.720
I think that one of the things that I found when I was looking at this was, first of all,

31:06.720 --> 31:08.600
I find Dave Dobenmeyer incredibly boring.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.600
Oh, he's bad.

31:09.600 --> 31:10.600
Yeah.

31:10.600 --> 31:15.120
And I don't know, maybe it's been a long time since I've looked at any of his actual shows

31:15.120 --> 31:16.320
or anything.

31:16.320 --> 31:21.600
It just struck me as like, you're just taking notes from Infowars shows and preaching with

31:21.600 --> 31:22.600
it.

31:22.600 --> 31:23.760
You're just doing that.

31:23.760 --> 31:25.700
It's stupid.

31:25.700 --> 31:31.760
It's almost like the idea of covering his show actually feels kind of like drinking

31:31.760 --> 31:32.760
backwash.

31:32.760 --> 31:33.760
Yeah.

31:33.760 --> 31:34.760
Yeah.

31:34.760 --> 31:35.760
I'm not interested.

31:35.760 --> 31:36.760
Yeah.

31:36.760 --> 31:44.080
But he was there and this is an interesting set of circumstances, an interesting set of

31:44.080 --> 31:45.080
behaviors.

31:45.080 --> 31:49.400
He would be like, hey, Trump is telling us all to get on the field.

31:49.400 --> 31:54.580
You know, like, well, I mean the three jurisdictions thing, that's just good, clean fun.

31:54.580 --> 31:55.580
That's fantastic.

31:55.580 --> 31:56.580
Yeah.

31:56.580 --> 31:57.580
That's fantastic.

31:57.580 --> 31:59.800
They're literally talking about the possibility of storming the Capitol and how the police

31:59.800 --> 32:00.800
will stand down.

32:00.800 --> 32:01.800
There's not enough of them.

32:01.800 --> 32:02.800
Yep.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.800
And then the next day there's a conspiracy afoot.

32:04.800 --> 32:05.800
It's somebody else's fault.

32:05.800 --> 32:06.800
It's somebody else's fault.

32:06.800 --> 32:07.800
They're trying to set us up.

32:07.800 --> 32:08.800
No, we didn't do anything.

32:08.800 --> 32:13.460
The police let us in and when they let us in, they embedded Antifa and Black Lives Matter

32:13.460 --> 32:14.460
in there.

32:14.460 --> 32:15.460
We're doing this.

32:15.460 --> 32:18.640
We're so strong, but we're the victim.

32:18.640 --> 32:20.000
It's really dumb.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.480
Bunch of fucking cowards.

32:21.480 --> 32:23.220
It's very dumb.

32:23.220 --> 32:25.200
And perhaps so was this.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.200
Who knows?

32:26.200 --> 32:27.200
That's what I'm saying.

32:27.200 --> 32:28.200
I want a higher quality of criminal.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.440
I think I've said that before.

32:29.440 --> 32:30.440
Yeah, exactly.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.900
It's just that whole thing of just like, really?

32:32.900 --> 32:35.300
This is who we're up against?

32:35.300 --> 32:37.540
Come on, man.

32:37.540 --> 32:38.540
It is.

32:38.540 --> 32:41.040
This is the shittiest fascism I've ever seen.

32:41.040 --> 32:45.240
Yeah, I bet all of them have been disappointing in the moment.

32:45.240 --> 32:47.440
Yeah, well that's probably true.

32:47.440 --> 32:53.000
I bet over time they take on more of a serious character.

32:53.000 --> 32:59.480
Yeah, I imagine if I went and went back and watched a serious documentary about Mussolini,

32:59.480 --> 33:01.240
they'd be like, look at this fucking idiot.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.080
What are we talking about with this guy?

33:03.080 --> 33:04.080
How did he take over?

33:04.080 --> 33:05.080
Yeah, probably.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.080
Yeah, probably.

33:06.080 --> 33:11.240
Anyway, Jordan, I apologize that we don't have a full episode for today, but...

33:11.240 --> 33:13.520
Absolutely, this is a bottle episode.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.560
Battlestar Galactica is over.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.720
It's like that Breaking Bad episode with the fly.

33:18.720 --> 33:19.720
Yeah, exactly.

33:19.720 --> 33:24.280
But the fly is a coach.

33:24.280 --> 33:28.040
The fly is just Dave D'Aubenbier whispering like, hey man, it's gonna happen.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.040
Would you pass the salt?

33:29.040 --> 33:30.040
It's gonna happen.

33:30.040 --> 33:33.120
It's just a fly asking for salt.

33:33.120 --> 33:40.120
Alright, well, we'll be back on Wednesday with a full-on Alex Jones episode, but until

33:40.120 --> 33:41.120
then Jordan, we have a website.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.120
We do have a website.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.120
It's knowledgefight.com.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.120
Yep, we're also on Twitter.

33:44.120 --> 33:45.120
We are on Twitter.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.120
It's at knowledgejones.com.

33:46.120 --> 33:47.120
Now go to Matt Jordan.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.120
We're also on Facebook.

33:48.120 --> 33:49.120
We are on Facebook.

33:49.120 --> 33:53.080
If you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

33:53.080 --> 33:54.080
doing God's work.

33:54.080 --> 33:58.640
Yeah, we'll be back, but until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZXClark, I'm Daryl Rundis,

33:58.640 --> 34:01.000
I'm the Juiciest Ice Cube.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.360
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air.

34:02.360 --> 34:03.360
Thanks for holding.

34:03.360 --> 34:04.360
Hello, Alex.

34:04.360 --> 34:05.360
I'm a first time caller.

34:05.360 --> 34:06.360
I'm a huge fan.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.360
I love your work.

34:07.360 --> 34:37.320
I love you.
