N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
knowledgefight.com

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's time to pray.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I have great respect for knowledge fight.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Knowledge fight.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We are the bad guys. Knowledge Fight.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Dan and Jordan, Knowledge Fight.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Rattle her, rattle her, rattle her.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I need, I need money.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Rattle her, rattle her, rattle her.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Stop it, Andy and, Andy and, Andy and, Andy and, Andy and,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's time to pray.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I love your work.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Knowledge Fight.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
knowledgefight.com

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I love you.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm Jordan.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh, indeed we are Dan.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Jordan.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Dan.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Jordan.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I have a quick question for you.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What's up?

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What's your bright spot today?

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
My bright spot today, Jordan, is, so I mentioned not too long ago,

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
a little while back, Policy Wonk Lisa signed us up for the

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hot Sauce of the Month Club.

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Indeed.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And I got the second installment of the Hot Sauce of the Month Club.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I like it.

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And I think, I think it's called FYM Sauce.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know what it stands for.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Fuck your mother.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Or, uh, fuck your mouth, something.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, I hope it's not that, that's creepier.

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, I mean, it's, you're putting spicy things in your mouth.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I understand that, but somehow it's just, unfortunate.

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't mean, I mean fuck your mouth and like fuck your feelings.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I understand that.

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Forget about your mouth.

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, I mean, you can say that a lot of different ways.

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Sure.

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Um, it's very challenging, the sauce.

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's, it, I had some on some chicken nuggets last night.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Would you say it's a real motherfucker?

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes.

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay.

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes, it definitely is.

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I, I tossed the nuggets in the sauce.

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Uh huh.

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And for a good couple hours afterwards, I was sort of like, oh Nelly.

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh boy.

62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, sweating from the face a good bit.

63
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Took me for a ride.

65
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I really enjoyed it.

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Although stomach, stomach had some.

67
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
All those, all those noises that you made are, do not denote a joyful ride.

68
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No, generally not, but I enjoyed it.

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's a, it was good.

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It was good.

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The first month was really, it was good.

72
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It was hot, but it was, it wasn't like, it wasn't a trial.

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Sure, sure, sure.

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Kafka had nothing to do with it.

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah.

76
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This came fast.

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It ramped up really fast and it creeped on you too.

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I see.

79
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Good, good stuff.

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I believe you.

81
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm ready for month three already.

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes, I believe you.

83
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What about you?

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Uh, uh, Dan, my, my bright spot is I, uh, I finally got my equipment worked out.

85
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I finally got it all set up and I did a little bit of streaming today.

86
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Video games streaming.

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I did a little bit of video games streaming.

88
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Congratulations, over on Twitch.

89
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Played, uh, Final Fantasy 7, the remake.

90
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Awesome.

91
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
My plan is I've decided to riff the, the whole game.

92
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah.

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Like MST3K, but for Final Fantasy 7.

94
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That sounds fun.

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's my plan.

96
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Very difficult.

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I mean, paying attention to playing and trying to talk at the same time.

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's very hard.

99
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I think it's a, I think it's an acquired skill too.

100
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You get better at it as you go along.

101
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah, I enjoyed it.

102
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It was, uh, it was good times.

103
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Good times.

104
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, I was, I look forward to joining you at some point while you do these video game

105
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
streams.

106
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, indeed you will.

107
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And make fun of your terrible play.

108
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can't wait.

109
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It'll be great.

110
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, look at you.

111
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's, uh, yeah.

112
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Using that materia.

113
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I, I realize that, uh, just randomly saying I'm going to start at 2 central on a, on a

114
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
day, but, but it's like I finally got everything worked out so that it would work.

115
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And you know me, I don't do well with like delay.

116
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh, we're going to start doing that now.

117
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I was like, now begin it.

118
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm releasing my book.

119
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't give a shit.

120
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah.

121
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah.

122
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And I don't think there's a problem with that.

123
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You'll work out a schedule eventually.

124
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, that'll be good.

125
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And I'm sure some people came in and enjoyed the time.

126
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So some walks get to hang out.

127
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That might be a better thing to do for a live stream.

128
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If anyone in our audience is interested in it, then us live streaming episodes, quite

129
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
frankly, that might be better because you can be distracted while you're playing a video

130
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
game.

131
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's much more frustrating when I'm distracted trying to host a podcast.

132
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's fair.

133
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That is definitely fair.

134
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Can't, uh, can't quite keep up with the chat.

135
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah, no, that's a, that'd be interesting.

136
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I look forward to it.

137
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't know if I've completely figured out how to set it up so we can all be on there

138
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
together without the lag screwing everything up.

139
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Uh, but I think I can always just come over to your house too.

140
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You can just come over to my house.

141
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's true.

142
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah.

143
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We're in a, we're in our COVID bubble.

144
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's fair.

145
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's fair.

146
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm a little bit cramped in my, in my tiny little room.

147
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's fine.

148
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Um, so Jordan, today, uh, we got an interesting episode to go over.

149
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We're back to talking about Alex Jones after Monday's little, uh, salt break, as I've decided

150
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
to call it.

151
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't think that's bad.

152
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Um, so we have to do a little bit of catch up.

153
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And so what we're doing today is we're going over January 14th to 17th, which is, uh, uh,

154
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of last week, all within the year 2021.

155
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Blackjack!

156
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Blackjack, baby!

157
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,320
I want to add a baby to it.

158
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
I like it.

159
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,320
I don't know.

160
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
I feel like it's forced.

161
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
All right.

162
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
We'll see.

163
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
We'll see.

164
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,080
Um, so what my plan is, is to go over this period of time.

165
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:27,680
And then for Friday's episode, we will witness the end of Trump's presidency on Alex Jones's

166
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
show.

167
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
Oh boy.

168
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,000
So that will be, uh, you know, I mean, just the sound of silence.

169
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah.

170
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hello darkness.

171
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But for two to three hours, as we listen to one man lose his mind.

172
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That'll be fun.

173
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,840
Um, so I got, uh, I got an interesting, uh, stretch here.

174
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,120
There's some really, really troubling stuff.

175
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,440
Some really stupid stuff.

176
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Sure.

177
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,480
And Alex realizing that Steve Pachanik has been fucking with him for 20 years.

178
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
Finally.

179
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Thank God.

180
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,840
I am looking forward to the moment that I get to hear that happen.

181
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,720
He has a dark moment of clarity on Saturday.

182
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
I love it.

183
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Give it to me.

184
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,480
I'm not going to go into business on all of this, but first Jordan, we're going to take

185
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,840
a moment to say thank you to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show.

186
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Oh, that's a great idea.

187
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,160
So first Rory loves a low low.

188
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Thank you so much.

189
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
You are now a policy wonk.

190
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
I'm a policy wonk.

191
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
Thank you very much.

192
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
RLL.

193
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Thank you.

194
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
Yeah.

195
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
My, one of my aunts is a Lois.

196
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
Lois.

197
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
But she goes by low low.

198
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Oh, I like low low.

199
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
I like low low.

200
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
Yeah.

201
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
It's a good name.

202
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
Next Harold drop dead.

You are now a policy wonk.

205
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
I'm a policy wonk.

00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Thank you very much.

208
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
Thank you.

209
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,920
Anderson Intel extraordinaire.

210
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Thank you so much.

211
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
You are now a policy wonk.

212
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
I'm a policy wonk.

213
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Thank you very much MPIE.

214
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,040
Next.

215
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,160
The Hills Have Thighs.

216
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
Thank you so much.

217
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
You are now a policy wonk.

218
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
I'm a policy wonk.

219
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,160
Thank you very much.

220
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
THC.

221
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Why is everybody doing it in acronyms?

222
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,920
They requested that I say it really ominously.

223
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,640
So I did my best ominous reading there.

224
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
You did great.

225
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Thank you.

226
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
Next Morrissey's finger.

227
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
Thank you so much.

228
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
You are now a policy wonk.

229
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
I'm a policy wonk.

230
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,120
Thank you very much Morrissey's finger.

231
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Thank you.

232
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Next Talon from Minneapolis.

233
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Thank you so much.

234
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
You are now a policy wonk.

235
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
I'm a policy wonk.

236
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Thanks Talon.

237
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Thank you.

238
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,320
Then finally I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on Elevated

239
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,000
Love and appreciate that very much.

240
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,040
So Andy B. from Minnesota.

241
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Thank you so much.

242
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,200
You are now a technocrat.

243
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,600
And Ghost Panda of Coal Creek.

244
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Thank you so much.

245
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
You are now a technocrat.

246
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
I'm a policy wonk.

247
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Crikey mate.

248
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
That's fantastic.

249
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Have yourself a brew.

250
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
How's your 401k doing bro?

251
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,920
We gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson alright?

252
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,480
Let's just get down to business.

253
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,560
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

254
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,480
Why you pimps so good?

255
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,120
My neck is freakishly large.

256
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,600
I declare info war on you.

257
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,800
Thank you so much Andy B. up in Minnesota.

258
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,740
Thank you so much to Ghost Panda of Coal Creek.

259
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,240
Thank you very much to the both of you.

260
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
Yeah!

261
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
Is Coal Creek in Minnesota?

262
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Uh I don't know but it is.

263
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
I think Minnesota has a Coal Creek.

264
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Minneapolis, Minnesota and Coal Creek.

265
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
We got a lot of Minnesotans.

266
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,040
We got a whole, yeah yeah yeah.

267
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,760
All the Canucks that are slightly lower.

268
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Sure.

269
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
That's what I'm gonna call them.

270
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Sure.

271
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,040
All I can, the only reference I've got is I guess Prince and Ryan Sayers.

272
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Alright.

273
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
Okay.

274
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,040
That's all I got.

275
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,040
Musical references.

276
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
I like it.

277
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,000
I think I've been to Minneapolis.

278
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,040
You think you have?

279
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
I have.

280
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,360
There are so many cities in the US that I think I've been to but I'm not positive.

281
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,480
I got kicked out of a billionaire's house in Minneapolis.

282
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
Really?

283
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Yeah yeah yeah.

284
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
What happened?

285
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,280
I used to work for, I used to sell hearing aids and the like.

286
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Okay.

287
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,720
And one of the owners of the biggest hearing aid cartel in the world is stationed out of

288
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Minneapolis.

289
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Was it Prince?

290
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Uh no.

291
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Oh.

292
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
It's a guy named Rogers Nelson.

293
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Something.

294
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,320
But the company's name is Starkey and we got invited there because my cousin has his whole

295
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,360
thing and we got invited to his house as like a reward for people who sold some number of

296
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,760
hearing aids and he and I got way too drunk and we were asked to leave.

297
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Oh wow.

298
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
So it was nice.

299
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
It's an experience.

300
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
Yeah.

301
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
I peed on his floor.

302
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
I'm proud of myself.

303
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Jeez.

304
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Alright.

305
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Were you proud of yourself the next morning?

306
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Yes.

307
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Fuck that guy.

308
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Oh wow.

309
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Okay.

310
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
You and I are different.

311
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,880
Also I mean at the same time my boss at the time was my cousin so I had a little bit more

312
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
of a.

313
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
Little wiggle room.

314
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,600
I can be on the floor of a billionaire's home.

315
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Yeah.

316
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
You know.

317
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Yeah.

318
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
So Jordan we're gonna start here on the 14th.

319
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Let's do it.

320
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
We got some bad news to start things off.

321
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Alright.

322
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,040
The left is on a rampage.

323
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
Sure.

324
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,600
I've been here since very early this morning.

325
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:33,000
I've been doing a lot of research and then we had the FBI contact us just about 30 minutes

326
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,280
ago and then I found out why Roger Stone is in hiding.

327
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,180
It was worse than we thought.

328
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,260
Somebody came to his house and then waited for his wife who was handicapped and hearing

329
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,600
impaired and beat her up.

330
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,640
So she's been in the hospital and they also sent somebody to Laura Loomer's house to try

331
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,480
to kidnap her and so this is the Bolshevik takeover.

332
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,160
You just need to understand that.

333
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,000
You need to know that.

334
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,640
And they are actively trying to say that we masterminded the attack at the Capitol with

335
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,160
the U.S. military.

336
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,360
So that's the line they're going with now.

337
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Haha.

338
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Unbelievable.

339
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,960
On the 14th news that Roger Stone's wife was attacked by a leftist activist went huge all

340
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,760
over the conservative media.

341
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,360
Blogs ran unconfirmed articles about how they were targeted for political violence and commentators

342
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,640
opined about how the mainstream media was covering it up.

343
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,160
Then on the 15th there was an article in the Floridian Press that sought to clear things

344
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,360
up a little bit.

345
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,440
They reached out to Roger and reported quote we learned that media outlets today began

346
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,480
to fudge the facts of the incident and as the story was recycled around the truth of

347
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,960
what happened was distorted.

348
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Here we go.

349
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,760
Here's the statement they published from Roger about the truth of the incident.

350
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,420
Quote on December 23rd my wife Nydia and my Yorkie Mimi were attacked by a pit bull.

351
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,480
Our beloved dog was badly injured requiring two surgeries and Nydia was bitten badly when

352
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,480
she attempted to get between the pit bull and our baby.

353
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,920
This incident was reported to both Fort Lauderdale police and Broward County Animal Control.

354
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,520
Nydia sustained substantial injuries in the pit bull attack.

355
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,760
Last week there was an incident in front of our home when we returned from dinner.

356
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,840
A man on a bicycle recognized me and started screaming numerous political epithets which

357
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,240
are not fit for a family newspaper.

358
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,480
While there was a scuffle Mrs. Stone sustained no new injuries in the event.

359
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,800
Reports that she was badly beaten or hospitalized are incorrect.

360
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,840
This event was also accurately reported to the Fort Lauderdale police.

361
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,440
Seems like Alex is kind of embellishing the story a little bit.

362
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Poor dog.

363
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,000
He probably should have reached out to Roger for a comment considering how close the two

364
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
of them are.

365
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,440
Not answering his phone calls.

366
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,820
I'm sure Roger would have been happy to clear things up so Alex wouldn't have to report

367
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,000
a completely false story about Roger's wife on air.

368
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Not interested.

369
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,880
Seems fucking disrespectful as hell.

370
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,220
In answering Alex's phone calls.

371
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,760
So I would say this is not good.

372
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,780
And as for the story about Laura Loomer I'm gonna need to see some evidence before I even

373
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,160
start caring about whatever's going on there.

374
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,440
Anything that's reported about her on Infowars is an attempt at a publicity stunt until proven

375
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
otherwise.

376
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah all I can think is that Roger himself is on a rampage and has been dressing up like

377
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
a pit bull.

378
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,880
That's the only thing that makes sense to me.

379
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,480
He's attacking people left and right dressed up like a pit bull.

380
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,320
His day drinking has evolved.

381
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,120
So now we get to the new framing of the storming of the Capitol back on January 6th.

382
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,320
Alex has some historical parallels.

383
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:31,160
I feel like we're on the fifth new framing of an event that doesn't need any new framing.

384
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,760
We're gonna get a couple ones on this episode.

385
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,040
We're gonna get a couple framings.

386
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,040
This is frustrating.

387
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
And one new patsy.

388
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
Okay good.

389
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,320
The headline of Infowars.com is confirmed January 6th capital attack was Reichstag 2.0.

390
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,440
If you don't know about the Reichstag attack we're gonna be covering that when we come

391
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:58,960
back because right in that printer snuggled in that warm printer is the little printout

392
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:04,120
where I'm gonna read you about what happened in the Reichstag attack.

393
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,420
But that's what this is.

394
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,640
This is a Reichstag attack that happened right when Hitler got elected.

395
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
He was very unpopular.

396
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,800
They thought he'd stolen the election and he firebombed that bitch.

397
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,000
So this isn't good.

398
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,920
I like the idea that something's getting printed out.

399
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,600
I'm excited to find out what that's gonna be.

400
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Wow they gotta print it out.

401
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,960
It's got the little hooks on the edge.

402
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,560
They gotta perforate the thing and tear it apart.

403
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Yeah.

404
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,720
So Alex has a couple of details wrong about the Reichstag fire here.

405
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
Sure.

406
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
That's surprising.

407
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,600
The most important element he's completely making up is that the fire happened after

408
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,560
Hitler won an election that people thought was fraudulent.

409
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
That's nonsense.

410
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,080
Alex is saying this because he knows that his audience is gullible and if he paints

411
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,040
a one-to-one comparison of Hitler and Biden it stands to scare them more and drive more

412
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,880
profits to info wars.

413
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,440
In reality the Reichstag fire occurred on February 27th, 1933.

414
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,000
In January of that year Hitler had been appointed Chancellor of Germany's government which was

415
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,640
still under the control of the country's president Paul von Hindenburg.

416
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,040
The structure of the government was that the president was the elected leader of the country

417
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,740
who would then appoint a chancellor who would be responsible for introducing legislation

418
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,040
to members of the Reichstag who were also elected officials.

419
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,680
At any point the president could dismiss his chancellor, you know, that he had control

420
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,920
over that position.

421
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,680
Or so he thought.

422
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,720
Well, according to the Smithsonian Magazine, quote, Hindenburg reluctantly appointed Hitler

423
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,120
as chancellor on the advice of Franz von Papen, a disgruntled former chancellor who believed

424
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,400
the conservative bourgeois parties should ally with the Nazis to keep the communists

425
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
out of party.

426
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,800
Man, I have heard something like that so frequently in the past.

427
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,240
Fear of communism leads to aligning with fascists every time.

428
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,860
It does seem like it happens every time.

429
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,480
The reality of the Reichstag fire is that it was an event almost certainly committed

430
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,020
by the Nazis which they blamed on communists.

431
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,620
This allowed Hitler to use the event as a rallying cry against the communists and as

432
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,400
a justification for why the government needed to assert dictatorship level powers to crush

433
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
the threat they posed.

434
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Sure.

435
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,920
There's no better way to put this than this.

436
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,840
What Alex is doing right now is attempting the same political maneuvering that the Nazis

437
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,240
engaged in in 1933.

438
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
Yes, correct.

439
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,840
There was a terrible event that drove home the sobering reality to a large portion of

440
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,440
the country, and that terrible event can be incredibly useful if you can blame it on your

441
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,680
enemies.

442
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,960
This is why Alex is now on air fudging details about the Reichstag fire.

443
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,960
And if you did it, it is wise to blame it on your enemies, otherwise people will think

444
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,320
it's your fault.

445
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
True.

446
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
Yeah.

447
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,240
It's definitely true of the present situation.

448
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
Yeah.

449
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
You don't want people to think it's your fault.

450
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
No.

451
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
No.

452
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,760
So Alex really has a bad handle on history.

453
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Oh yeah.

454
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,760
I've heard him, I mean, like, you know, the fake quotes are one thing.

455
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Sure.

456
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,520
But like, man, he's way out of line here.

457
00:15:48,520 --> 00:16:04,520
February 27th, 1933, from the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.

458
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
That was the date.

459
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
February 27th, 1933.

460
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:13,480
Adolf A. Lewis Hitler had narrowly won the presidency of Germany, but von Hindenburg

461
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,320
was not stepping down as the chancellor.

462
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,320
The most powerful position in the Weimar Republic.

463
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,000
This is crazy not true.

464
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah.

465
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,460
Hitler had not won an election for the presidency of Germany.

466
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:32,160
He was chancellor beginning in 1933, at which point he began maneuvering to seize more and

467
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,340
more power for himself in the Nazi party, who had had a great showing in the Reichstag

468
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,280
elections in the 1932 election.

469
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
People like Nazis.

470
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,280
Yeah.

471
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,760
Hindenburg died in 1934, at which point Hitler dissolved the office of the presidency and

472
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,960
combined its powers with that of the chancellor, essentially making himself both chancellor

473
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
and president.

474
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,800
In the 1932 election, Hindenburg had soundly defeated Hitler, but the Nazi party itself,

475
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,000
like I said, had gained a large number of seats.

476
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,960
The scenario that Alex is painting is 100 percent revisionist history, because he needs

477
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,520
his audience to think that they're living through a direct parallel to Hitler's rise

478
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
to power.

479
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,040
Paul von Hindenburg wasn't chancellor, and there was not a contested election for president

480
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,120
in the way that Alex is describing.

481
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,200
This is just an idiot making stuff up because he knows his audience doesn't know any better

482
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,120
and won't bother to look into it.

483
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,680
Does not care either way.

484
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Yeah.

485
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,200
This is one of the things I'd really like to drive home to anyone who may have some

486
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,360
inclination to take Alex Jones seriously or think he knows what he's talking about.

487
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,720
If he has this little a grasp of basic facts, like who was in what office when the Reichstag

488
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,620
happened, and he's so willing to confidently assert really fundamental inaccuracies, why

489
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,280
would you ever give him the benefit of the doubt with more complicated stuff?

490
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,960
If he can't be bothered to understand really simple arithmetic, you shouldn't listen to

491
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,840
him about geometry or algebra or trigonometry.

492
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
He doesn't know how to add.

493
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,540
No, no, no, absolutely not.

494
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,520
He doesn't have a basic grasp of the fundamentals of existence.

495
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,120
He doesn't know grammar.

496
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,960
Don't let him tell you how to edit your paper or whatever.

497
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,620
I don't know what the metaphor would be, but if you don't know the building blocks upon

498
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:12,160
which understanding can be built, you- Right.

499
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,560
I feel like one of the fundamental things that he doesn't get is that some things are

500
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,400
and some things are not.

501
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,960
Everything seems to be fungible there, but some things have to be and some things have

502
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
to not be.

503
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,240
And the things- They cannot just be whatever you want them

504
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
to be.

505
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Right.

506
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,880
And if he wants me to take it all seriously, the idea that he knows this secret information

507
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,800
that Hitler was set up or all this nonsense that he throws around all the time, this revisionist

508
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,920
World War II history, and he doesn't know who was in what office, that's embarrassing,

509
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
man.

510
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,360
You can't do this.

511
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,440
You know what is blowing my mind, and it's just going to be so painful.

512
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,180
It's going to be so painful, Dan, if you recall, oh, those early days in 2017, whenever you

513
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:02,360
would call Trump a Nazi, and people would go, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't just throw

514
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,980
that word around.

515
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,280
That's a terrible thing to do.

516
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,360
It needs to be used correctly.

517
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,720
And now we are about to begin a long stretch of literally everything Biden does-

518
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
Nazi.

519
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Making him a Nazi.

520
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
Yep.

521
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,860
That will be screamed at us from all corners of the world, including the ones who screamed

522
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,400
at us to not call Trump a Nazi.

523
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,720
I would say almost exclusively from those corners.

524
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

525
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,840
But if they come from Alex, one of the good things you can always fall back on is he knows

526
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,320
literally nothing about World War II history.

527
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
That's fair.

528
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:41,160
But days after the election that Hitler won by a very slight margin, fire bombs hit the

529
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,720
Capitol and was blamed on his enemies, the communists.

530
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,040
At least he's not pretending it wasn't the communists who got blamed.

531
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Yeah, that's nice.

532
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,140
Yeah, it's almost like he's trying real hard to thread the line where he's like, the Nazis

533
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,280
were the good guys here.

534
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
Oh, so what's he saying?

535
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,840
The election days, what is he saying?

536
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,480
The election prior to the Reichstag fire was in April 1932, about a year prior to the fire.

537
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,000
360, 330 days prior after the, yeah.

538
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,600
There was an election for Reichstag members scheduled for six days after the fire, but

539
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,360
that's the opposite of what Alex is describing.

540
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,800
Alex either knows nothing about World War II history and is pretending he does in order

541
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,640
to scare his audience, or he does know what the reality is and he's willfully lying to

542
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,400
them in order to make it more closely match this scenario also to scare them.

543
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
You betcha.

544
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,720
You really should stop.

545
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
This is pretty bad.

546
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,720
It's bad.

547
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,720
It's real bad.

548
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Congratulations though, Alex.

549
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,440
You have a real depth of, remember when you said you read a hundred books on World War

550
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
II?

551
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
A thousand books on World War II?

552
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:45,440
Are there any Nazis in the United States willing to sue on behalf of the Nazi party for Alex's

553
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,720
bad portrayal of them?

554
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,960
I mean, it's just-

555
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960
Slander, sir.

556
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Yeah.

557
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Slander.

558
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,520
I mean, there's things that are interpretation and there are things that are like, what was,

559
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,400
who was where?

560
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
What power alignment-

561
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,480
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

562
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,920
Some things are and some things are not.

563
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,200
You can't just say that that's how-

564
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,160
It's staggering to me.

565
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,680
It's embarrassing for Alex and he never has to pay any consequences, even in terms of

566
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,040
embarrassment for not knowing any of this shit.

567
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,320
Yeah, and the people who believe him are so, so sad.

568
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,600
So Alex mentioned earlier that the FBI called him.

569
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,040
Yeah, we might learn a little bit more about that.

570
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,840
Man, wow, I've hit Twilight Zone, Twilight Zone.

571
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,120
Like in the world of Twilight Zone, for something to be even weirder, like imagine what people

572
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,720
in Twilight Zone, when they watch the Twilight Zone, it must be even weirder or like in the

573
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,040
Twilight Zone of the Twilight Zone.

574
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
That's just regular-

575
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
Yeah, we'd like you to come in and talk about-

576
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
It's a double negative.

577
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,340
You don't know math, man.

578
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,840
Your people in the military have quite distinguished records that work there and you notice this

579
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,400
and that, yeah, we want you to know about what you know about what happened in there.

580
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Wow.

581
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,520
Wow, ladies and gentlemen.

582
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,280
I'm guessing that, first of all, you're right, the Twilight Zone and the Twilight Zone would

583
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
be just normal life.

584
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Yeah, normal.

585
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
I would assume.

586
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
They cancel each other out.

587
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
It's a regular zone.

588
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,800
Yeah, and no one ends up getting a harsh lesson about anything.

589
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,480
That would be the version of the show they watch in the Twilight Zone.

590
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,480
No, in the regular-

591
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,120
There's no poetic consequences for things.

592
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
Yeah, exactly.

593
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
It's just random like everything else.

594
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,120
Yeah.

595
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Yeah.

596
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,880
Well, I was talking about the FBI contacting him and I think I might know why that is.

597
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,240
You remember that he said he had an employee who was there and got footage of the woman

598
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,680
getting shot inside the Capitol?

599
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
Maybe.

600
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,320
Well, that means he had an employee who was illegally entering the Capitol.

601
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,680
That sounds like something the FBI would look into.

602
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,480
Alex's employee, Sam, released his raw footage of entering the Capitol building.

603
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,040
I'm just going to play you the minutes where he actually walked through the doors of the

604
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,780
building, thereby committing a crime, and see if you can see any reason why law enforcement

605
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,200
might be interested in talking to Alex.

606
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Okay, I think that's a good idea.

607
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Come on.

608
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Mic down for this.

609
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
All right.

610
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
We have had enough.

611
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
We're not going to take your fucking vaccines.

612
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,200
We're not going to take all your bullshit.

613
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,200
The people are rising up.

614
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,200
To be clear, that voice is the cameraman.

615
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Welcome home.

616
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Folks, I am now on the steps of the Capitol.

617
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
Here we go.

618
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Here we go.

619
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Having a good time.

620
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Having a good time.

621
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Everybody's having a good time.

622
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Look at this.

623
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,200
I don't think it costs them what to do.

624
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
This is the first time they've seen a peaceful protest succeed.

625
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
They're dumbfounded.

626
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
They're dumbfounded.

627
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Here they are.

628
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
Here they are.

629
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
All right.

630
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Folks, I don't know how I made it out of there without getting hurt, but your boy ain't hurt.

631
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,200
But I got to be honest.

632
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
This is not a peaceful protest.

633
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
This is not a peaceful protest.

634
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,200
So I just want to be accurate about that.

635
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
But for whatever that means, you heard it.

636
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,200
As I was going along, I tried to ask a few people what that's going through their mind or what they're feeling.

637
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
I don't know what to say.

638
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
But they've had enough.

639
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
You heard that last gentleman?

640
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,200
He feels like this is the people's house.

641
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,200
And so the people want to take it back.

642
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
See?

643
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
So here we go.

644
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,200
We got SWAT gear over there.

645
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Everybody in.

646
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
Keep the line moving.

647
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Keep the line moving.

648
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
All right.

649
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,200
This is your boy Sam with Infowars.com.

650
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Support the war.

651
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Infowarsstore.com.

652
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
We got sales to go.

653
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
We got sales for days.

654
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:48,200
Please, it's because of your support that we're able to get into things like this and show you the real news that the media won't.

655
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
That they will spin tomorrow.

656
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
They're going to spin it.

657
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
But guess what?

658
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Guess what?

659
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:03,200
We are in the Capitol, baby!

660
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,200
He's doing a plug as he enters the Capitol.

661
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
I just don't.

662
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
These people need to be babysat.

663
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:21,200
I don't even know if they need to be punished or if they need to be babysat because they clearly have no ability to process reality.

664
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Like none.

665
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
It's amazing.

666
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Just none.

667
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:34,200
You walked into the Capitol building doing an ad for the thing that you're not supposed to be doing.

668
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,200
I'm going to add that to my quickly growing collection of things that really don't look good in hindsight.

669
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
This is not a peaceful protest.

670
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
This is not a peaceful protest.

671
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Infowars.com.

672
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Infowars.com.

673
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
We're in the Capitol, baby.

674
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Oh, man.

675
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
You can't really be doing this.

676
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:58,200
I got to assume that there's a lot of people who have been arrested for breaching the Capitol.

677
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Even people who were just recording, people who didn't break anything.

678
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
It's still illegal entry.

679
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
That is true.

680
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,200
I don't see why Sam wouldn't be arrested.

681
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,200
Oh, well, you can't arrest him.

682
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:14,200
He works for Infowars, the tip of the spear, and the FBI is afraid of pissing off Alex.

683
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,200
I would also assume that should Sam be arrested, there might be some interesting questions about,

684
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Oh, you work at Infowars.

685
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,200
Why did you record going in?

686
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Did Alex send you there on an assignment?

687
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Well, I can only say it's with your support that Infowars continues storming the Capitol.

688
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Certainly it does imply that little clip of video tends to indicate that he was there in an official capacity.

689
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
It would suggest that, yes.

690
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:48,200
As part of his duties while promoting Infowarsstore.com, he committed a crime.

691
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,200
Yeah. Yes.

692
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,200
That might be something that people would want to talk to Alex about.

693
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
I don't know.

694
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,200
We're in the looking glass here, Dan, we're in the twilight zone of the twilight zone.

695
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
Sure.

696
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Yeah.

697
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Everything's normal.

698
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,200
So anyway, Roger's wife's going through some things.

699
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Sure.

700
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
This is the real world.

701
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
You cannot make this up.

702
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:14,200
And Roger Stone, a man ran over his wife.

703
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Jesus.

704
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,200
And she got back up and he knocked her over again.

705
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
And she has major, and then he knocked her over again.

706
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,200
And so Roger now is going into hiding.

707
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
This isn't a joke.

708
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:37,200
His wife is in the hospital to have emergency surgery because a man beat his wife up.

709
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Just randomly in their little condo area.

710
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Nobody's around.

711
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Randomly.

712
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
She's walking the dog.

713
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
A dude pulls up on a bike and starts knocking him over.

714
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
She gets up.

715
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
He knocks her over repeatedly.

716
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
That's the left for you folks.

717
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
If I were Roger, I'd be pissed about this.

718
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Yeah.

719
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
I'd be really not happy about Alex's behavior.

720
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Yeah.

721
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Don't fucking embellish stories about my wife in order to make people scared of the left.

722
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
Jesus.

723
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
You dick.

724
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
I know that's the job.

725
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

726
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Come on.

727
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,200
I'm not saying that I hope someone screamed cut his dick off at Roger Stone, but I'm not

728
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
not saying it did.

729
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,200
So if I were Roger, I'd be mad about that.

730
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Yeah.

731
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
But I'd also not be thrilled about this.

732
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,200
That's where we are right now is beating up a 75-year-old or whatever she is.

733
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
She's older than Roger.

734
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Look how old his wife is.

735
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
Still looks great for 77 years.

736
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Oh, my God.

737
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
His daughter's not bad looking either.

738
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
I mean, I mean, that's like God made beautiful women.

739
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
I'm not hitting on them.

740
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
I'm married.

741
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
I'm saying nice ladies.

742
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Wow.

743
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
What are we doing?

744
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
What do we got?

745
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
Do we got to do that?

746
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,200
We don't have to do these things, Alex.

747
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,200
We don't have to say his daughter's hot.

748
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
We don't.

749
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Well, I mean, it's it's an interesting way.

750
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,200
He was trying to recover from saying that Roger's wife was hot.

751
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Like, oh, I'll save this by saying his daughter's hot.

752
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

753
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Let me objectify his child instead.

754
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
That'll make it better.

755
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,200
Ah, what a good save, everybody.

756
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Why isn't everybody reaching up for high fives?

757
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,200
I got high fives going on.

758
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Where's everybody else's high fives?

759
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,200
So we get back now to the Reichtag fire.

760
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,200
And I was so glad that this paid off because I was worried that that stuff that he was

761
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,200
printing out wasn't, you know, it was going to be the opposite of Chekhov's printer

762
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,200
paper, but we do find out what he had an intern print out for him.

763
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
This is Reichstag 2.0.

764
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
Reichstag fire.

765
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
The Reichstag fire German.

766
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Fire was a arson attack on the Reichstag government building, the capital.

767
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Home of the German parliament in Berlin on Monday, the 27th February, 1933.

768
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,200
Precisely four weeks after Adolf Hitler was sworn in as chancellor of Germany.

769
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,200
Hitler's government stated that it goes on, Marinus van der Lib and all the rest of it.

770
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,200
So this is the Wikipedia article about the Reichstag fire.

771
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Great, great.

772
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,200
If you ever want to tell yourself that Alex does any work, please call this image into your mind.

773
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Great.

774
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
He doesn't do shit.

775
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,200
He has his interns print Wikipedia pages for him to fumble his way through blindly reading.

776
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,200
When he said German of fire, that's because on the Wikipedia entry, they include the German

777
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,200
word for the fire, which confused Alex while he was cold reading.

778
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
There we go.

779
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
This is pathetic.

780
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Wow.

781
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Anyway, more revisionist history about Hitler coming up.

782
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,200
You know, it's one of those things where by having papers, you assume a legitimacy that

783
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,200
somebody ostensibly from the internet doesn't have.

784
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Something about having physical papers suggests, look, we at least did the work, and then you

785
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,200
find out they just printed out the internet, and that's ten times less interesting.

786
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
And it's Wikipedia.

787
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
And it's Wikipedia.

788
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,200
Yeah, I mean like it's the newsmen of days of yore might have desk papers that they're

789
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,200
looking at, or like you might, you know, I don't know, maybe I've only seen this in sitcoms,

790
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,200
but like somebody comes running in with a piece of paper.

791
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Oh yeah, breaking news, sir.

792
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Yeah, breaking news.

793
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,200
Yeah, typed up, there's transcriptions because you couldn't even do shit like that.

794
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,200
You just had to read it out loud like a man.

795
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,200
Yeah.

796
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
Yeah.

797
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,200
And I think Alex is trying to emulate that to give himself some kind of like the appearance

798
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
of that, and it's just Wikipedia articles.

799
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Not good.

800
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
All right, here's more bullshit.

801
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Hitler first only got elected president, it wasn't enough, and then there was people were

802
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:16,200
fighting over him trying to become the Fuhrer, and have the former head of the Weimar Republic

803
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:22,200
step down, and so they had to stage this event that came out in the Nuremberg Trials.

804
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Hitler was not elected president prior to the Reichstag fire.

805
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,200
He'd been appointed chancellor by Hindenburg.

806
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,200
The title Fuhrer didn't really even exist at the time, and I guess he was the Fuhrer

807
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,200
of the Nazi party, but it wouldn't come into being like a state role until after Hindenburg's

808
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,200
death, when Hitler combined the offices of president and chancellor into a new title,

809
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Fuhrer and Reichschansler, which eventually got shortened to Fuhrer.

810
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
And then they got shortened to senate majority leader.

811
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Yeah.

812
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,200
I hate to sound like a broken record here, but Alex is just making shit up about Nazi

813
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,200
history for his own benefit here, and then pretending that the Nuremberg Trials back

814
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
him up.

815
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:02,200
The thing that I think is most transparent as an aspect is that Alex knows damn well

816
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,200
in that moment, he's making this up.

817
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
He knows he's making this up.

818
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,200
That's why his citation is something like the Nuremberg Trials, which is absolutely

819
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
useless as a reference.

820
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
So general.

821
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
What part of the trial?

822
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
How many months long?

823
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,200
Years long?

824
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
What exactly came out in those trials even?

825
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
He's not even saying.

826
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,200
It's in the white papers, but the trial papers.

827
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,200
When you try to pull the thread there to determine how reliable a source he's being, you have

828
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,200
nowhere solid to go other than thousands of pages of testimony, and you're not even

829
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,200
really sure what you're looking for to prove Alex right or wrong.

830
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
That's a big part of Alex's game.

831
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,200
One of his favorite things to do is make absurd, completely false claims, and then insist that

832
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,200
some impossibly long text actually proves him right.

833
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,200
He's never read those texts, but it doesn't matter, because he knows that his audience

834
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
hasn't and won't either.

835
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,200
That's why he'll constantly just point at thousand-plus page books like Tragedy and

836
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Hope or Ecoscience and just insist that those things actually prove him right, and it's

837
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
all in there.

838
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
Yeah.

839
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,200
It's a way of trying to railroad criticism and make it impossible for anyone to actually

840
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,200
engage with the things that are being said unless they've read these really long books

841
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
that Alex is pretending to have read.

842
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,200
I would dig through the Nuremberg documents to disprove what Alex is saying, but he gives

843
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,200
up his right to be taken seriously when he completely fabricates history like this.

844
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Yeah.

845
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
But I couldn't help it, so I did dig around a little bit.

846
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Sure, sure, sure.

847
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,200
This is from page 110 of volume 2 of the trial of major war criminals.

848
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,200
This is spoken by Justice Robert Jackson, the chief U.S. prosecutor at the Nuremberg

849
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,200
trials.

850
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,200
Quote, the burning of this symbol of free parliamentary government was so providential

851
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,200
for the Nazis that it was believed they staged the fire themselves.

852
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Certainly, when we contemplate their known crimes, we cannot believe they would shrink

853
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
to mere arson.

854
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,200
It's not necessary, however, to resolve the controversy as to who set the fire.

855
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,200
So I guess if Alex is saying that it came out in the Nuremberg trials that the Nazis

856
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,200
themselves set the fire, the chief U.S. prosecutor doesn't seem to be even making that indictment

857
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
in the Nuremberg trials.

858
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,200
And in fact, though it's generally accepted consensus that the Nazis did probably start

859
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,200
the fire, definitive proof is hard to come by even today.

860
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,200
Even the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum says, quote, the origins of the fire are still unclear.

861
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Sure, sure.

862
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,200
I mean, I think the prosecutor really makes a good point, which is just like, ah, just

863
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
add it.

864
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Just, Amy, take it off, add it.

865
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
It doesn't matter.

866
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Yeah.

867
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
Anytime.

868
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
No, no, no.

869
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
It's better just to be like, it doesn't even matter.

870
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,200
Yeah, yeah.

871
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Who cares?

872
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
What they did was horrible enough.

873
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,200
That would be a genocide.

874
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,200
A fire is not, yeah, yeah.

875
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Yeah.

876
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Anytime somebody is engaging in World War II revisionism, where they're like changing

877
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:48,200
a little bit of the story away from Nazi genocide is to me like that sign that you're eventually

878
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,640
going to try and get me to think that even if there was a problem with Hitler, it wasn't

879
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,480
the genocide or the fascism part.

880
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,200
I see you coming, sir.

881
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,720
Yeah, Alex is really fucking weird on this.

882
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,200
Like this really struck me as like, this is unnecessary.

883
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Yeah.

884
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:13,400
He really is exposing of a either complete and total ignorance of history on Alex's part

885
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:21,040
or a willingness to lie to his audience in a way to make history look like what he wants

886
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,120
the present to look like to them in order to convince them of a lie about the present.

887
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,120
No, totally.

888
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,600
Which is like either of those are pretty bad looks.

889
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,160
Yeah, I mean, what's that old saying?

890
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:36,760
He who lies about the past controls the present and then becomes Senate Majority Leader.

891
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:44,680
So we get a guest at this point on the 14th, he's a guy who hides in bushes.

892
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,680
He's the Batman.

893
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,680
He's the Batman.

894
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,680
He's the Batman.

895
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,680
It's John Rappaport.

896
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
It's the Bats.

897
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,520
John Rappaport hasn't been a guest on the show much in the recent history.

898
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,900
So people who have just discovered our show recently probably won't know of our obsession

899
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,900
with John Rappaport.

900
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,480
He followed us on Twitter for a while.

901
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:09,320
Several hundred episodes and then boom, much like the Bat, gone into the night.

902
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:17,720
He is a guy who is a quote unquote investigative journalist, is an HIV denialist, is a real

903
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,720
dick.

904
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,720
I think he's hypnotizing Alex.

905
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,320
Alex has an intense emotional reliance on him.

906
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,600
Oftentimes whenever John hosts the fourth hour, Alex will do five minutes with him where

907
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,800
he is just like, John, John, I need you, John.

908
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,120
Just tell me I'm doing good.

909
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,080
John, we love you so much, John Rappaport.

910
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,640
Tell me I'm a good man, John.

911
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,320
John, I just need to hear that I'm a good man.

912
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,520
So his interview is not really all that great.

913
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,240
It's kind of just about how like, you know, Aunt Aoife did that shit.

914
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,120
Why do I feel like they went through the Rolodex of Infowars guests and were like, I guess Rappaport's

915
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,840
the only one who hasn't been documented as saying we did it.

916
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,160
We took over the Capitol in a positive way.

917
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,840
There are there are a fair amount of like, wow, they're back.

918
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,160
Like Mike Adams was back.

919
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

920
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,280
Like just the last couple episodes, Rappaport's here showing up later.

921
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,240
We're going to get Steve Quayle is fucking back.

922
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,920
Who here was against the coup?

923
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,920
Who?

924
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,920
Anybody raise their hands?

925
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,920
Anybody?

926
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,920
Oh, boy.

927
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,920
Oh, not a lot of faces.

928
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,920
OK.

929
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,920
All right.

930
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,160
So here's here's a little taste from their talk.

931
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,840
Who is this guy standing next to him?

932
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,640
Oh, well, he was arrested over here.

933
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:30,640
You know, all of this comes tumbling out and arrested and let go.

934
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,680
They've got this Antifa leader that you mentioned saying, burn the Capitol down on video.

935
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,680
He was released.

936
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,080
You know, it's like the Keystone Cops.

937
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,240
So Alex is referencing John Sullivan, who is not an Antifa leader by any stretch of

938
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
the word.

939
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,520
Initially, Alex had been saying that this dude had been arrested and let go and he was

940
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,360
making up both things.

941
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,680
Since then, Sullivan had been arrested, but he wasn't really let go.

942
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,680
He was released from jail without bail.

943
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,960
But whenever Alex brings that up, he fails to mention that conditions of his release

944
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,560
included surrendering his passport, having his computer activities monitored, being not

945
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,120
allowed to go on social media and being under house arrest.

946
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,900
He's definitely still in huge trouble.

947
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,120
But the phrasing that he was released from jail is being misrepresented by people like

948
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,320
Alex to imply that the charges have been dropped when that is not the case.

949
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,600
Yeah, the legal system is not really their interest in portraying accurately.

950
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,600
No.

951
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Capital letters and stuff.

952
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Yeah.

953
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,160
Also, I don't know all the details, but Sullivan's not someone who left-wing activists seem to

954
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,720
like.

955
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,720
They hate him!

956
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
And have for a while.

957
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
Long good time.

958
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Yeah.

959
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,280
There's an article on The Intercept that cites a number of activists from the West Coast

960
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,720
who have raised concerns about him long before he went to DC.

961
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,480
But anyway, weirdly, you know where I actually first saw John Sullivan?

962
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Where?

963
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
The one that was shot at him for the first time?

964
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
The Whole Foods?

965
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,180
It was in the footage from inside the Capitol that was shot by the Infowars employee named

966
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,180
Sam.

967
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,180
Interesting.

968
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:01,360
Here's Sam talking to John Sullivan just after that woman got shot, trying to get the footage

969
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,880
that John Sullivan had shot of the incident.

970
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,800
He actually saw her die.

971
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
He actually saw her...

972
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
I'll post the video.

973
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
I have the video.

974
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
I have the video of the guy with the gun and the shooter.

975
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
I want to get with you.

976
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
I'm with the Bullers.com.

977
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:07,480
Just J-

978
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:20,600
I haven't, but I will look it up.

979
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
Okay.

980
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
Infowars.com.

981
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Okay.

982
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
I got you.

983
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
I want to get your info right now if you got that shot.

984
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
I have it.

985
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Oh, I was right behind the door.

986
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
Okay.

987
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
I need that footage, man.

988
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
It's going to go out to the world.

989
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
This has changed so much.

990
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:36,000
I cannot believe that shit.

991
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,140
So there's a couple of interesting things here.

992
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,720
The first is obviously how ghoulish it is that these two are so interested in talking about

993
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,680
how good their footage is of a woman being shot so soon after and so close to where the

994
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,680
shooting happened.

995
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,880
There's a real grim voyeurism on display here that I think reflects poorly on them both.

996
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,880
Yeah.

997
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,800
Secondly, it's interesting to me that John seems unaware of Infowars.

998
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,360
If he were really an Antifa provocateur who was there to set up the Patriots and make

999
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,700
them look bad, it seems strange that he would sound completely unfamiliar with the name

1000
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,240
Infowars who are supposed to be the patsies and fall guys of this whole thing.

1001
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,960
Conversely, if he really were a left-wing activist, it seems unlikely that he would

1002
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,440
be unaware of Infowars in that circumstance, too, given that they're a media organization

1003
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:20,240
that proves and poses a very real and relevant threat to left-wing activist communities.

1004
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,500
I honestly don't know what to make of their exchange, and I can't possibly imagine how

1005
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,000
difficult it would be to process information after seeing someone get shot.

1006
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,820
So not recognizing a name could just be a brain lapse.

1007
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,120
I have no idea.

1008
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,340
But I do think it's pretty funny to look at the dynamics here.

1009
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:38,960
On the 6th, when Alex was on his own show, he was touting this footage that he'd gotten

1010
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,500
from inside the Capitol of the shooting.

1011
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:46,180
That footage was shot by Sam, the Infowars employee, and John Sullivan was the other

1012
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:51,400
footage that Alex had, who has now turned out to be an Antifa agent provocateur.

1013
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,520
I honestly wonder if Alex even realizes that the person that Sam got footage from to send

1014
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,160
to Alex was John Sullivan.

1015
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,720
Plausible deniability.

1016
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,400
I bet Alex doesn't even realize.

1017
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
He doesn't care.

1018
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
No.

1019
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
Yeah, it's bad for him to know that.

1020
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Yep.

1021
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,400
Yep.

1022
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,400
So now we get another guest on.

1023
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,680
It's an online right-wing talk show host.

1024
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,720
I'm not sure if I've ever heard him be on Alex's show before.

1025
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,720
He might have been.

1026
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,720
I'm not sure.

1027
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,720
Pete Santilli.

1028
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,720
Okay.

1029
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
The Santilli Lace.

1030
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,720
Okay.

1031
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,720
I couldn't help it.

1032
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Yeah.

1033
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,320
I don't like this guy, but I also am not interested.

1034
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:27,520
Then on January 20th, our commander in chief hasn't called us to a peaceful protest to

1035
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,600
Washington, D.C.

1036
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,000
He just said, wherever you protest, protest peacefully.

1037
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,120
I believe that they're setting the stage.

1038
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,460
The FBI said that they forewarned the Capitol Police that there were going to be some agitators

1039
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,460
coming in.

1040
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,460
How do they know that?

1041
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,880
Because those agitators worked for the FBI.

1042
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,540
They had let the Capitol Police's guard down.

1043
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,160
They allowed this thing to take place.

1044
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,480
They had their operatives breaking the window.

1045
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,200
And then obviously the emotion involved in just walking.

1046
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,480
Well, we got three years ago from 2018, but it was from 2015.

1047
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,360
The headline info wars was Obama planned martial law in Maryland.

1048
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
How'd that go?

1049
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:09,000
And the documents are there where they plan to like go provocateur and get it to be triggered.

1050
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,160
And we actually have the anti-fidocuments.

1051
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
That's what they do.

1052
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,840
Yeah, those documents still aren't real.

1053
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,080
They're still definitely just something that Harrison Smith found when he was cruising

1054
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,080
around 4chan.

1055
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,920
No contracts with the Soros son, Dan.

1056
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,320
So Pete Santilli is a guy who's like a radio show host, but he's only relevant at all because

1057
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,720
he was arrested at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge occupation.

1058
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,720
Sure.

1059
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,280
The charges ultimately were dropped against him, most likely because he was both occupying

1060
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,620
the refuge and pretending to be a journalist.

1061
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,700
So they didn't even want to fuck around and try and figure out how that first amendment

1062
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,700
needle gets threaded.

1063
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,700
And like, ah, who cares?

1064
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,660
Much like who set the Reichstag fire, they're like, Jesus Christ, that's just too much.

1065
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,660
It's too much.

1066
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,660
It's too much.

1067
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:55,840
And he's on just to try and help Alex convince people that the feds set people up and that,

1068
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,480
you know, like coming weekend, it's all going to be a mess.

1069
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,080
There's going to be agent provocateur events, mass shootings, bombings.

1070
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,800
And now that we're here recording this on Tuesday,

1071
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,680
I think it's, I think it's fascinating to me just because in some ways this is kind

1072
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:18,200
of the only way that these people would be able to try and keep their people from committing

1073
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:23,120
mass acts of violence because they can't come out and say, we were lying to you because

1074
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,360
then the people will be like, uh, no, you weren't.

1075
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,040
Or you're lying to us now.

1076
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,220
Or it doesn't matter.

1077
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,960
We still want to overthrow the Capitol.

1078
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,080
But if you say that, if you go, you're going to be a provocateur and then blamed, that's

1079
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,980
more likely to cut through the, it's like, it's like when you're talking to a child in

1080
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:44,320
pretend land, you have to talk to the pretend land child, not the regular one.

1081
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,320
Yeah.

1082
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:51,880
But if you just say something along the lines of like complete denunciation of violence,

1083
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,880
you stand to lose a certain amount of your audience who will think that you've sold out

1084
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:01,880
or something because that is how information is filtered for a lot of these communities.

1085
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,880
Yeah.

1086
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,160
You have to be like, okay, yeah, yeah, you want to do this and you're right to want to

1087
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,600
do it, but if you do it, it's a trap and you'll be a symbol that'll bring all your brethren

1088
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,600
down.

1089
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,600
Totally.

1090
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,600
That is probably the only way.

1091
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,600
Yeah.

1092
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,600
Yeah.

1093
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,600
Yeah.

1094
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,600
It's, it's weird.

1095
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,600
You have to play the game.

1096
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
It doesn't really work for everyone.

1097
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
I don't know.

1098
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
Yeah, we'll see.

1099
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,600
Anyway, this was pretty fun.

1100
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:29,740
Uh, Pete Santilli has one big message and it's like, yeah, all right, I believe I can.

1101
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:34,560
What I want everybody to understand right now is that your most trusted people that

1102
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,600
you have around you are going to be the ones that you will, you will be shocked that they're

1103
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,360
actually working for this entity.

1104
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,680
There's trillions of dollars at stake.

1105
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,360
Your security person may be paid a hundred thousand dollars to set you up, to gather

1106
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:56,320
enough information in order for you to make a statement on recording, uh, and, uh, and

1107
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,080
essentially be used in an indictment.

1108
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,160
So Pete's messages, nobody in the right wing can be trusted.

1109
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:07,140
Hey, listen, everyone, everyone will absolutely abandon you the moment that it is expedient

1110
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,140
for them to do so.

1111
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,140
Yes.

1112
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,920
Everyone in this right wing community has a fucking price tag and you can't afford them.

1113
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,920
Yeah.

1114
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,280
Have you guys, did you guys ever hear about Stalin's closest, uh, Politburo friends and

1115
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,280
all that stuff?

1116
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,160
Did you ever notice how they backstabbed each other all the goddamn time?

1117
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,160
Well, guess what?

1118
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,160
That's what fascism is.

1119
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,560
Well, I know that, uh, Stalin burned down the Reich tag.

1120
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,560
Yes.

1121
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,560
Why not?

1122
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,560
Why not?

1123
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,560
We don't have time to figure it out, Dan.

1124
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,840
So, uh, Pete, uh, makes a bit of an accusation here that, uh, I found distasteful.

1125
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,600
I believe, and we're getting information now that there were maps that were put out.

1126
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:47,920
A guy named John Sullivan, who is a known BLM and Tifa, uh, activist just so happened

1127
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:53,340
to be present with her, uh, how she was able to determine that going through the labyrinth

1128
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,920
of the, you know, the hallways in the halls of Congress, how she was able to get to that

1129
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:04,060
one particular spot where secret service would be, I'm sure was provoked by John Sullivan.

1130
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,560
She's very emotionally involved.

1131
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,560
They break the window, she goes up there, she gets shot.

1132
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,920
I gotta say, it feels kinda like defamation to just randomly imply that just because Sullivan

1133
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,880
was near Ashley when she got shot that somehow he led her there.

1134
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,280
If the standard for making that accusation is that low, then it could easily be said

1135
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,040
that Alex's cameraman, Sam, must have led her to where she got shot since he was right

1136
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,040
there too.

1137
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,040
Oh shit, Sam's Antifa.

1138
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,040
Oh no.

1139
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,040
God damn it, Sam.

1140
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,240
Oh, and Troyer's Black Lives Matter flag burning friend Taylor Hansen was right there too,

1141
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,080
so he must have been the one who led her there.

1142
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,080
Antifa.

1143
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,760
There's a very serious accusation that Pete is making based on nothing, and the only reason

1144
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,400
he's doing it is so that he doesn't have to feel bad about being an active participant

1145
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,840
in the media ecosystem that misinforms and radicalizes people like Ashley to the point

1146
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,560
where she thought it was a good idea to storm the Capitol.

1147
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,440
He can't take that really hard look in the mirror, so the best way to put that off is

1148
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,320
to come up with a convenient story where someone else is the bad guy who actually secretly

1149
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,200
had machinations to lead to this.

1150
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:08,400
Yeah, at no point in time can that man just say, wait, I think it was me and my ilk that

1151
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,400
led her there.

1152
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,400
Oh.

1153
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,320
Maybe there are real world consequences for bullshit.

1154
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:19,160
Oh no, if I have that reflection, I have to change my behavior or recognize that I'm a

1155
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,160
villain while I profit off it.

1156
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,160
Oh no.

1157
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,160
Yeah.

1158
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,160
Oh.

1159
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,320
Anyway, good luck, Pete.

1160
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,840
So Alex keeps lying about Roger's wife, and we don't need to hear more of it because it's

1161
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,640
basically just the same thing over and over again.

1162
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,640
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1163
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:37,000
We've got another guest on, and I think that this guest has listened to our show.

1164
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:44,120
It's Ezra Levant from Rebel Media, and I really think, tell me if you know why I think that.

1165
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,540
What happened at the Capitol?

1166
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,540
What's your view?

1167
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,540
What's coming next?

1168
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,240
Ezra Levant of Rebel Media.

1169
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:57,560
Well, look, we all know the phrase fake news, and you can battle fake news on a daily basis,

1170
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:03,920
but what happens when the news cements, when that cement hardens, and it becomes history?

1171
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,120
You can't even unargue or dislodge it.

1172
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,640
I'm not saying that I came up with that metaphor, but it's something that I've used in this

1173
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:18,600
very specific context many times, and he uses it multiple times in this interview.

1174
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,080
And I was just sitting here like, you motherfucker.

1175
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,280
You can't weaponize my own shit against me?

1176
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,280
Dickweed.

1177
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,160
So anyway, that guy sucks.

1178
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,160
Very interesting.

1179
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,080
As an interview, we're going to jump to the 15th.

1180
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,080
So the 15th is Friday.

1181
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:37,400
I hope he does listen to our show so we can find out how little we give a fuck about it.

1182
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,400
Yeah, don't care.

1183
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,400
Piece of shit.

1184
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,920
Go cry to Tommy Robinson about cement.

1185
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,920
No shit.

1186
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,920
Fuck you.

1187
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:48,720
Anyway, so we had some vaccine-possibly-related deaths in Norway, and Alex is covering that

1188
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,720
story.

1189
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:57,120
I can spend an hour just on this little darling right here from Infowars.com, which is the

1190
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,120
story.

1191
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,560
Just got links to mainstream Reuters, you name it, foreign news, Norway TV.

1192
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:07,440
23 dead in Norway after taking COVID vaccine, and they said, that's okay, it's going to

1193
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,440
kill some people.

1194
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,160
See, they're now just normalizing the death.

1195
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,460
That's just one article here.

1196
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:16,120
So this is an instance where the headline can look pretty scary, but the actual story

1197
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,120
might not actually be as much of a cause for alarm as it seems.

1198
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,960
The first thing to be clear about is that these deaths that have happened in Norway

1199
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,160
are obviously being studied.

1200
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,200
And at the time of this episode, there's not been any causal link that's been made between

1201
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,760
the vaccine and these deaths, which is important to nail down.

1202
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,880
If Alex had actually read some of the underlying information that this Infowars article is

1203
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,600
based on, like there's a CNN article, you would have read this explanation from Stephen

1204
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:49,200
Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical

1205
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,200
Medicine.

1206
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:55,800
Quote, Evans told the UK's Science Media Center that when people who are at high risk of death

1207
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,800
get vaccinated, there will be a certain number of coincidental deaths that occur shortly

1208
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,560
after vaccination.

1209
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,760
Regulatory bodies across the world are closely monitoring these fatalities, Evans said, and

1210
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,960
are able to calculate the expected number of deaths within various time periods.

1211
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:15,960
Quote, we do not yet know, but it would seem that the observed numbers of deaths is not

1212
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,240
notably above the numbers expected, he said, adding that there was, quote, no need for

1213
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,560
anxiety but complacency is equally mistaken.

1214
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,600
If we're vaccinating people who are going to die soon, some of them are going to die

1215
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,140
soon after we vaccinate them.

1216
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:37,000
People who are in high risk categories may have a higher expectation of coincidental

1217
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
death.

1218
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,200
That is a factor that needs to be taken into account.

1219
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:47,080
Also the possibilities brought up in these articles of minor side effects possibly being

1220
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:53,520
much more serious issues for people with more complications.

1221
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:59,520
Anyway, I think that if you look at something like how this guy, Steven Evans, is explaining

1222
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,920
the situation, I think that sounds very responsible.

1223
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:08,360
Because he has both sides sort of reflected there, which is like, there's reasons why

1224
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,280
this number would be there.

1225
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,680
People are looking at it and will understand this better.

1226
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:17,040
This is not a reason to be super worried, but it's also not a reason to just be like,

1227
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,040
eh, whatever.

1228
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,840
And I think that's fair.

1229
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:26,600
I remember when I was young, when I was little, they had kids Bibles, you know, that were

1230
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,880
illustrated and they simplified a lot of the stories and they left out all the rapes.

1231
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,080
And I think that's what we need for like science news journalists.

1232
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:40,760
We need to give them like the kiddie version of real science and they can disseminate that

1233
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,240
so people don't get too scared, you know, because we can't be having people with headlines

1234
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:52,960
like vaccine involved in two deaths.

1235
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,320
That headline is true.

1236
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,320
Yeah.

1237
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,320
Well, no, it's not.

1238
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,240
I mean, 23 people died after getting the vaccine.

1239
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:06,400
It's unclear if it's related or connected in how many of the cases it is, is unclear.

1240
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:13,600
But yeah, the headline itself can be weaponized so easily by people with the wrong information.

1241
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,640
Yeah, it'd be good.

1242
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,800
Messaging is critical at this point with medical information, I think.

1243
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,640
I would change that headline to tens of millions vaccinated without dying.

1244
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:32,280
Unsurprisingly statistically relevant, but unsurprising so far at this point in time.

1245
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,680
Let's go back to the old tracks from the 60s.

1246
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,600
I want Thomas Paine to start writing our fucking headlines.

1247
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,600
That's what we got to do.

1248
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,600
Okay.

1249
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,600
Okay.

1250
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,600
We'll take that under advisement.

1251
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,600
Yes.

1252
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,600
Alex has another headline.

1253
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,600
Okay.

1254
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,600
Study.

1255
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:51,320
COVID lockdown harms are 10 times greater than benefits and causes more people to die

1256
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:59,440
from suicide, drug addiction, drug overdose, and more, but that's okay.

1257
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,480
I can tell from the phrasing of the headline that Alex is reading there that it's a post

1258
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,080
in an outlet called the Dhaka Tribune.

1259
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,840
I didn't know that Alex kept up with the Bangladeshi media.

1260
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,840
Ooh.

1261
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,920
One of his interns just has a Google alert for lockdown studies and this one hit the

1262
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,920
filter.

1263
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,920
Sure.

1264
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,080
This was an article published on January 11th about a paper put out by a Canadian doctor

1265
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,760
of pediatrics named Ari Joff.

1266
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,120
The paper is called COVID-19 Rethinking the Lockdown Groupthink and it's not been published

1267
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,440
by anyone nor is it peer reviewed.

1268
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,440
Odd.

1269
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,160
Also it was written last October.

1270
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,080
Alex absolutely didn't read this paper.

1271
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,920
One of his interns just sent him the headline from an outlet in Bangladesh covering a Canadian

1272
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,280
paper that no one cared about three months ago.

1273
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,280
Great.

1274
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,280
Great.

1275
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,280
Bad work.

1276
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,280
Great.

1277
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,280
Great.

1278
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,280
Great.

1279
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,280
Just great.

1280
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:51,680
Now Alex gets to a point where he kind of thinks, well, maybe we've got to move on.

1281
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,000
Maybe we've got to move on from Trump.

1282
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Okay.

1283
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,040
I think he's starting to have those feelings of like, we must move forward.

1284
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:04,480
I could snap my fingers and come out against Trump and come out against the second amendment

1285
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,160
and I can't get into details because it's private things that are done.

1286
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,320
This is how the law works as long as something is illegal, I will go have private meetings

1287
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:16,240
with the globalists and their minions and, but I mean, I can snap my fingers and betray

1288
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,680
the second amendment, betray America, betray Trump to make it so easy.

1289
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,560
Just come out against the second amendment just a little bit, come out for red flag laws

1290
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:29,080
or, or, or come out for just against Trump a little or, or just leave radical Islam alone

1291
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:34,280
or just stop harping on this pedophilia thing all day and all your problems will stop Jones.

1292
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,280
Yeah.

1293
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,040
Jones, you can come back into the fold right now.

1294
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,880
Jones, you'd come back in.

1295
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,880
Really I can.

1296
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,880
Great.

1297
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,880
No, I don't.

1298
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,880
I don't want to come back in your fold.

1299
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,920
I've never been in your fold.

1300
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,840
I don't want to be in your fold, but that's where this is.

1301
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:51,020
People say, well, Jones, you just said red flag laws is one of their stipulations.

1302
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,680
Trump said he was for that.

1303
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,680
Trump said that.

1304
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,700
So they would say we want total gun confiscation.

1305
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,700
And so he would shut it all down.

1306
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,700
I agree.

1307
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,700
It was a mistake.

1308
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,480
I said it was whenever I talk about something Trump did, why he thought he did the right

1309
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,480
thing.

1310
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,120
I'm so you can get my take on why he did it.

1311
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,120
Doesn't mean I agree with him.

1312
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,480
He said, hey, you shouldn't have to take the vaccine.

1313
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,480
But oh, here it is.

1314
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,480
Let's turn the economy back on.

1315
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,560
Cause he gets, that's the main mission is shut the economy back off.

1316
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,440
Doesn't mean I agree with him trying to defeat them in that capacity.

1317
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:24,480
And it failed and he failed to do the right thing when it came to the censorship.

1318
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,600
And now he knows that.

1319
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,800
And now the whole world knows that it doesn't matter.

1320
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,520
Now we move on.

1321
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,720
Now it's Joe Biden who is a fraud who we will never accept, who is going to come after us

1322
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,720
hardcore.

1323
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,840
He's going to get on the offense against him because he runs a globalist crime family against

1324
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,440
our nation as fully compromised.

1325
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,000
So Trump will be gone in five days.

1326
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Trust the plan, right?

1327
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Unbelievable.

1328
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
We'll be right back.

1329
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I'm Alex Jones.

1330
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Tomorrow's news of the day.

1331
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Infowars.com.

1332
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,440
This dude's so mad about QAnon.

1333
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,320
Man, that's just bad writing.

1334
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,120
That's just bad fanfic is what we just heard right there.

1335
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,480
There's also, there's something interesting and paradoxical about Alex ranting about how

1336
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,240
the globalists want him to turn on Trump, but he won't do it only for him to then end

1337
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,480
his rant by saying we have to move on to fight Joe Biden.

1338
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,480
Well, sure.

1339
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,920
I guess it's not turning on Trump, but leaving that season of his show behind, maybe?

1340
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,040
Yeah, just toss it.

1341
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,280
If you're Alex, you don't get to do this.

1342
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,840
You don't get to whip your audience into an apocalyptic fervor about how Trump was appointed

1343
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,720
to be ruler by God and this election is a spiritual battle between Trump's godliness

1344
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,200
and the literal devil.

1345
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,320
Then when it's time to move on, you just say, we move on.

1346
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,240
Personally, I'm stoked the devil won.

1347
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,240
He's a good dude.

1348
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,840
I guess we've talked a little bit.

1349
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,840
He's everywhere.

1350
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:38,680
Alex promised the end of days and the fucking devil if Biden got in and guess what?

1351
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:42,520
It's probably just going to be a slightly disappointing government that Alex is just

1352
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,720
going to make a bunch of money yelling about.

1353
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,720
Fucking bullshit.

1354
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,080
Also, I want to point out this thing that Alex has been doing a lot lately that I find

1355
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,500
really offensive.

1356
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,160
He keeps talking about how he could join the globalists so easy.

1357
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,180
They want him on their side and at any minute he could be one of the elites.

1358
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:01,920
This is meant to be heard by the audience like an abusive spouse yelling about how they

1359
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,480
could do so much better.

1360
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,380
The message is really clear that Alex could join the globalists whenever he wants because

1361
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:11,500
he's special, but no one listening has the same offer extended to them because they are

1362
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,500
not special.

1363
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,500
Yep.

1364
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,000
And you should be glad that I'm not joining these globalists.

1365
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,400
You are fucking lucky I choose to shine my light on you assholes.

1366
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,400
Yeah.

1367
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,700
It's dark.

1368
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,680
It's really narcissistic and gross.

1369
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,680
Yeah.

1370
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,680
Yeah.

1371
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,680
I don't enjoy it.

1372
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,360
I would prefer he didn't do that or exist.

1373
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:39,640
Well, I mean, if he didn't exist, I know there's at least two people in the world who would

1374
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,680
miss him.

1375
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,200
I got the wrong clip here.

1376
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,200
Thinking real hard.

1377
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,760
I got the wrong clip here.

1378
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:51,800
Later Alex says that two famous people told him something.

1379
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,240
This is a clip where two people tell him about one single famous person.

1380
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,240
Okay.

1381
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,240
Alright.

1382
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,240
We gotta talk famous people.

1383
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,240
Rewind.

1384
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,240
Didn't hear that part.

1385
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,240
There's one person.

1386
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,240
2021.

1387
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,240
Blackjack.

1388
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,240
Yay.

1389
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,240
There's one person.

1390
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,240
Maybe.

1391
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,520
If Alex didn't exist, one person who's very famous who would be very sad.

1392
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,520
Oh.

1393
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,520
Christopher Watson?

1394
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,640
Paul Watson asked me like, what's going on with Jack Dorsey?

1395
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,200
He says he's for free speech and he hates the fact that Trump was censored, but then

1396
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,680
now there's this video where he's admitting it all, that he is censoring to his employees.

1397
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,400
He's like a man with a gun to his head and I think that's basically it.

1398
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,800
He's blackmailed for whatever reason it is.

1399
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,840
And so I told Paul, why not just tell you this now?

1400
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,960
It's not like a bragging thing.

1401
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,960
I don't care.

1402
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,960
It's actually weird.

1403
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:31,960
I think it's strange.

1404
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:39,200
I've been told by two famous prominent people that Jack Dorsey says Alex Jones is always

1405
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,740
right and that I'm like his guru.

1406
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,000
And then there's this big famous Hollywood producer.

1407
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,200
I'm not going to go any further.

1408
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:53,360
This big music producer that like is like their guru and then he's like, I'm being told

1409
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,600
this by two separate really famous people.

1410
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,400
And this is like a while back and I'm like, okay, all right.

1411
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,600
I mean, you can't make up the weirdness level.

1412
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,600
This is right before Phil Spector died, right?

1413
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,160
Yeah, I think so.

1414
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,680
This famous music producer fucking loves me.

1415
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,320
He's my, he loves me.

1416
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,800
He's a famous music producer.

1417
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:18,000
He's saying this was a while back, so it could have been Manson.

1418
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
That's fair.

1419
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
That's fair.

1420
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Yeah, man.

1421
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,560
I don't know.

1422
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,320
Let's imagine this is true.

1423
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,920
Do you have something better to do with your time on the show?

1424
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,480
No, no he doesn't.

1425
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,800
Why are you talking about Jack Dorsey?

1426
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,640
Jack Dorsey looks at me like I'm his guru.

1427
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,560
I'm really, really done with anybody treating a rich person like they're real.

1428
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,600
Like what's going on with Jack Dorsey?

1429
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,760
No, no, no.

1430
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,760
What's going on?

1431
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,760
Don't care.

1432
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,760
Money!

1433
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,760
The end.

1434
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,760
Jordan, I don't even care about Jack Dorsey.

1435
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,080
I want to talk about Alex Jones being his guru.

1436
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,080
Sure.

1437
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,080
Okay.

1438
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,080
All right.

1439
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,040
So in a sense, money is the only thing he cares about.

1440
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:04,200
Well, I mean, it must have felt terrible to kick your guru off of your own platform.

1441
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,200
Yeah.

1442
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,200
Ban him.

1443
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,200
Multiple times.

1444
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,200
Absolutely.

1445
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:13,640
And leave David Knight on.

1446
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,160
David Knight is my nightlight.

1447
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:21,120
I just think about this like you get kicked out of a bar and later you're like the bouncer,

1448
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,120
I'm his hero.

1449
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,000
He's my, he loves me.

1450
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,400
Guy fucking loves me.

1451
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:29,120
Broke his heart to kick my ass out of there.

1452
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,120
Yeah.

1453
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,560
But hey, look, Alex didn't tell that story to be powerful.

1454
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:39,680
By the way, folks, I didn't tell you that Jack Dorsey story to sound powerful or cool.

1455
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,680
I don't want to be part of Hollywood.

1456
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,160
I want to be part of the Washington power structure.

1457
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:50,680
It really is true that you cannot register or fathom how popular Infowars really is now.

1458
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,320
And that was all God's plan.

1459
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,720
And that was all you keeping us on air.

1460
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,720
All of us together.

1461
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,720
It was a team effort.

1462
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,560
It's extremely dangerous position to be in as well, but almost all these liberal talk

1463
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,720
show hosts attack me.

1464
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:02,720
They actually listen.

1465
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,360
I remember Mike Cernovich about five years ago, four years ago, he was visiting here.

1466
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,240
He says, don't you know, they all love you and they all listen all the time.

1467
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,480
And don't you know, all those big people like Jack Dorsey and all them are huge fans.

1468
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,400
And I'm like, dude, stop trying to build my ego up.

1469
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,400
I don't want to hear this.

1470
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,400
That's bull.

1471
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,520
It's all true, but I appreciate it.

1472
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,600
It is all bull.

1473
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:27,800
Can't believe anything Mike Cernovich says for one and then for two, uh, man, this is

1474
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,800
sad.

1475
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,800
This is really grim.

1476
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,800
This is bad.

1477
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,280
I guess, you know what?

1478
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,720
The only people that I could really make a solid case who really dislike him, but do

1479
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,520
listen to him are me.

1480
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:43,000
The yeah, that would be us.

1481
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,560
So Alex is a confusing man in many ways.

1482
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,560
Agreed.

1483
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,680
He has certain tastes.

1484
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,680
Disgusting ones.

1485
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,440
He has a crush on somebody Roger Stone's daughter.

1486
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,440
This really happened.

1487
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:01,920
I remember about a year ago visiting my, a little bit over a year ago, my, my wife's

1488
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,640
mother in San Diego.

1489
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:09,600
And so her house is little, so we said, well, let's go to this nice country club that has

1490
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,600
a hotel.

1491
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,600
Beautiful place.

1492
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,440
It was the Fairmount beautiful hotel on a golf course.

1493
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,160
We could walk around the golf course and stuff.

1494
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,160
I'm rich.

1495
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:26,000
All the chemical spraying that they add to the jet fuel and it's all in the patents and

1496
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Solomon.

1497
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It's all in the Nobel prizes.

1498
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I mean, it's been going on since the mid nineties.

1499
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,160
It's a perfect case of this industrial globalist takeover houses there and general public doesn't

1500
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,800
know, but it's hidden in plain view.

1501
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,320
I said, man, I want to have a website or a podcast.

1502
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:46,240
I told my wife this called Kim trails and country clubs because you're in this beautiful

1503
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,440
country club, these beautiful pools, beautiful statues, five star hotel.

1504
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,660
I never stayed somewhere that nice.

1505
01:02:52,660 --> 01:03:00,400
And there's Kim trails everywhere and it's just raining down everyone.

1506
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,240
And it's that symbol of how this has happened to everyone.

1507
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,480
So then I get up about 5 a.m.

1508
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:13,640
I've got to go get on the computer and research and I see, oh, well, that's it.

1509
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:18,280
This big pop star.

1510
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:29,280
She must be an Alex Jones lister because her new album is called Kim trails over the country

1511
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,920
club.

1512
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:42,280
Lana Del Rey, Alex continues being super still going on into Atlanta, Del Ray, super into

1513
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,720
Lana Del Rey.

1514
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,160
It's awesome.

1515
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:50,520
He's so into this Kim trails over the, over the country club and he can't even enjoy it.

1516
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,120
He can't even enjoy it.

1517
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,120
He loves it.

1518
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:59,600
He loves her and he can't publicly, he has to spend a fucking 10 minute jag on how famous

1519
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:05,400
he is to God damn tech people, but he can't even come out and say he loves Lana Del Rey.

1520
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,760
Now Alex, I would like for you to challenge yourself and explain to me how much you love

1521
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,600
the song born to die.

1522
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:20,280
Oh, Hey Alex, why don't you watch the national Anthem video and tell me what you think about

1523
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,960
that.

1524
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:24,960
Separate the art from the artist.

1525
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,960
This is what you got to do.

1526
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,360
You got to separate the art from the artist.

1527
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,920
It's just so great.

1528
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:34,920
It's so great that he has just out of like the last two albums just decided, I fucking

1529
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:35,920
love.

1530
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,920
He's into it.

1531
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:37,920
He's into it.

1532
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:38,920
Yeah.

1533
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:42,880
He's fallen for this Americanist, I guess maybe found out that she was dating a cop

1534
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,880
or something.

1535
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,880
Oh, that could be.

1536
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,880
I don't know.

1537
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,640
I don't know exactly what it is, but it is really weird.

1538
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,200
Is that what we should be doing?

1539
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:55,840
Should we, should the, should Antifa focus more on biplanes and crop dusting mind control

1540
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,600
over a resort towns?

1541
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,600
I don't know.

1542
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,600
I think that's a good idea.

1543
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:05,400
I listened to this, this chemtrails over the country club song and I don't know.

1544
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,680
I still like Lana Del Rey enough, but I think I might be a little bored.

1545
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:14,440
It's not, there were a couple of good songs on Norman fucking Rockwell, but like as a

1546
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:20,040
whole, I thought that song was really kind of just standard Lana Del Rey stuff.

1547
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:23,240
It didn't do anything that really intrigued me much.

1548
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:27,440
It kind of felt a little bit, a little safe, a little down the middle.

1549
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:33,080
Is this alphabetically the sequel to Bombs Over Baghdad?

1550
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,080
Yes.

1551
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,080
Okay.

1552
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,080
Moving on.

1553
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:46,600
So Alex interviews Larry Pinckney, uh, it was a Black Panther back in the day and they,

1554
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,600
it's nonsense.

1555
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:52,720
It's more just about how the FBI is running Antifa and Black Lives Matter and stuff.

1556
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:57,320
But then Alex gets back to talking about Roger's wife and this is the next day now.

1557
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,320
This is the 15th.

1558
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,800
He's still talking about Roger's wife.

1559
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,800
Already had a clarification.

1560
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:06,960
Roger Stone's wife got beat up, didn't actually happen on Thursday, the day before his wife

1561
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,960
didn't want to tell him.

1562
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,660
The guy ran her over with a bike in her front yard.

1563
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:14,960
She got up, he pushed her down two more times and she knew that Roger would go crazy.

1564
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,960
So she just said, a guy hit me with a bike.

1565
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:19,000
Then she had to go to the hospital the next day and then she told him the rest of the

1566
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
story that he told me.

1567
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
And he's so upset.

1568
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,720
He can't even come on the air and she's going to have an emergency surgery probably today.

1569
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,480
So that's a 74 year old wife and then they got beat her up.

1570
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,480
Okay.

1571
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,480
So, and they're trying to get Roger to go crazy.

1572
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,760
I mean, I understand that that's what's happening here and they did that to Larry Pinckney and

1573
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,760
others.

1574
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,040
Uh, I need your support.

1575
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,760
I appreciate your support.

1576
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,760
Wow.

1577
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:43,960
Alex, you can make up shit about my wife, but I'm not going on your show to lie.

1578
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:49,200
And please just whatever you do, don't use, uh, fabricated stories about my wife to sell

1579
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,200
pills.

1580
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,200
Oh wait, you did?

1581
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,200
Oh, how predictable.

1582
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:57,720
I think that's just, if you meet Alex and talk to him for more than an hour, you have

1583
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,960
to sign a waiver that says he's allowed to lie about your time together.

1584
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,720
You're probably, you're probably right.

1585
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:08,440
It's like a, like an NDA, but I'm going to lie about this.

1586
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:13,360
So Alex has another guest on and it's Steve Quayle, who is a noted weirdo.

1587
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:18,240
He is someone who has, uh, he has a long history with Alex and shows like Coast to Coast.

1588
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,560
He's also a guest on Jim Baker's show.

1589
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,120
He's vice president for a while.

1590
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,320
He's written books about giants.

1591
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,320
Sure.

1592
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,320
Sure.

1593
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:30,680
Apparently there's another book coming out soon about giants that Alex wants to not talk

1594
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,680
about.

1595
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,680
The Nephilim?

1596
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,680
Is that what we're talking about?

1597
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,680
We're talking about those giants.

1598
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,680
We're talking Bible giants.

1599
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,040
We're not talking giants.

1600
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:40,080
We're not talking about, uh, centers in the NBA.

1601
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,920
No, we're talking young earth creationism giants.

1602
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:47,640
We're talking about, uh, the angels who fell and breaded with human women.

1603
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,640
Good stuff.

1604
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,640
Got too big.

1605
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:50,640
Yep.

1606
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,640
Got too big, Dan.

1607
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:57,720
Alex, in the past, when we've listened to episodes from like the 2009 era around, then

1608
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:01,160
Steve Quayle is around a bit more and Alex always talks about like how he's a prophet

1609
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,360
and like he knows stuff ahead, man.

1610
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,040
He's just really right about stuff.

1611
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,960
So Alex asks him how he knows the stuff that he knows.

1612
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,960
I'm interested in finding out.

1613
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,600
I don't know if you could predict this and it's not a good answer.

1614
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,080
My testimony is simply this.

1615
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,600
I went from the gunner most, the uttermost.

1616
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,080
I was a president of attorney.

1617
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,080
This is important.

1618
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,000
Oh, that was wild on Montana state university.

1619
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,520
I went to how Lindsay talking about Jesus, never knew about Jesus, never knew anything.

1620
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,800
And I accepted Jesus in my heart.

1621
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,040
I went home that night.

1622
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:35,720
I was living in my mother's house and uh, Tim, Tim blocks from the university and Jesus

1623
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,460
literally, and I know this is going to flip, flip people out, but he literally appeared

1624
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:40,460
to me.

1625
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:41,640
I fell on my face.

1626
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:45,120
He gave me a panorama of history and told me he was calling me.

1627
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:50,320
Now understand, I just found out who Jesus was the day that that spirit of God convicted

1628
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,320
my heart.

1629
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,320
But here's the thing.

1630
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,000
He gave me a panorama of history.

1631
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,520
I saw it in the future.

1632
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,980
Just imagine a motion picture and then he gave me a statement.

1633
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:05,040
He says, Steve, I am going to hide the things from you until they're shortly to come to

1634
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,040
pass.

1635
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:10,320
And he told me, he said, I want you to prepare my people for the end of the age.

1636
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:14,820
I'll bring people that know to tell you what you need to know, but you must be faithful

1637
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:15,820
to warn them.

1638
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:16,820
Alex.

1639
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:17,820
That's true.

1640
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,000
From that and that launched me.

1641
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,120
Oh boy.

1642
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,400
You are such a good medium.

1643
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,720
You do not need to do voices.

1644
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:28,800
I, uh, the reason that you don't know things is because I'm going to hide them from you

1645
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:35,120
and tell, uh, I have appeared to you Jesus from beyond the grave and I shall give you

1646
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:39,760
convenient excuses for why I am not explaining things to you.

1647
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:44,840
Also if, uh, you know, the Lord came down and gave Steve a panoramic view of history,

1648
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,680
you should probably explain to Alex that Hitler wasn't elected president before the Reich

1649
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:49,680
Tech fire.

1650
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:52,960
You know, Jesus did left out that part for some odd reason.

1651
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,960
Now everything's in the panorama.

1652
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,880
He should know everything about history.

1653
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:02,480
But if you're seeing a panoramic view of history, uh, one, that's a lot to take in.

1654
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,480
Sure.

1655
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,480
How long was he there for?

1656
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,840
I mean, a day to God is a thousand years.

1657
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,840
Totally.

1658
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,720
But like, if you are there, like if we had some academics.

1659
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,720
By the way, by the way, I'm not quoting scripture.

1660
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,840
I'm remembering that because it's the name of a RZA song.

1661
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:21,320
Oh, the places that you learn.

1662
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,320
Sure.

1663
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,320
We see through a glass darkly.

1664
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:24,320
Indeed.

1665
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,920
None of us have the full picture, but the RZA has a clearer picture than the rest of

1666
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:27,920
us.

1667
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:28,920
That's true.

1668
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:29,920
Yeah.

1669
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:36,720
So Steve talked to God who gave him a panoramic view of history and told him that he was going

1670
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:40,200
to lead God's people or something.

1671
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,840
Now Alex had a different visitation.

1672
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,840
Sure.

1673
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,320
You see, you got a visit from Jesus.

1674
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,160
I got a visit from the other guy.

1675
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,640
So why did you get a visit from the Jesus?

1676
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,640
I got a visit from the devil.

1677
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:56,000
Because I was serving the devil wholehearted and somebody somewhere touched God for me

1678
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,200
because I was totally beyond.

1679
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,120
You're wiser than I am anyway.

1680
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,920
So why did I get a visit from the devil, which I'm not going to get into on air, but I got

1681
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:06,680
the other visit because I was pretty, I love God actually, but I got a visit from the other

1682
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,680
guy.

1683
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,600
Well, listen, you only get a visit from the devil.

1684
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,480
Even Jesus was tempted by the devil.

1685
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:17,680
I'm not saying either one of us are Jesus, but I think it's really important, Alex, that

1686
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,200
people understand something.

1687
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,800
This is a spiritual war.

1688
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,800
I don't know.

1689
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:28,400
I feel like everybody who's ever been interested in Alex Jones, again, should lead all their

1690
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:33,680
stories with Alex Jones, comma, guy who believes the devil visited him.

1691
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:34,680
Yeah.

1692
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:35,680
Yeah.

1693
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:38,600
I just have a heart to, I want to know the rules of this universe.

1694
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,240
It's really getting annoying.

1695
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:44,000
It's like whenever, it's like when you're watching a superhero movie and then at the

1696
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,600
deus ex machina, somebody already, all of a sudden has a new power.

1697
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,920
I'm annoyed by that.

1698
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:49,920
It's like heroes.

1699
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,920
Yeah.

1700
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:54,200
Set up the rules for me, exist within the rules of space.

1701
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,400
When they started to get to the point where they could give people powers and heroes,

1702
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,400
it's just like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1703
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,400
Come on.

1704
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,400
We can't do this anymore.

1705
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,400
No.

1706
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,400
What's going on with that eclipse?

1707
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,400
We can't do this.

1708
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,400
We can't do this.

1709
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:09,400
We can't just, everybody's claiming that they got visits from superpowers and shit.

1710
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,520
No, come on man.

1711
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,920
I got visited by Hephaestus.

1712
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,520
No, no, no.

1713
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,520
You don't get it.

1714
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,720
The god, the blacksmith god.

1715
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:20,040
See, it's actually proof that you're a good person that you got visited by the devil and

1716
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,520
that I was a bad person that I got visited by Jesus.

1717
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,500
You see how it works, man?

1718
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,320
It's like yin and yang, but we don't believe in that bullshit.

1719
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:28,320
Yeah.

1720
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,320
Great.

1721
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:32,600
So that's the kind of conversation that's taken place.

1722
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,400
Yeah, I believe that.

1723
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:39,360
And I've been listening to this and I'm thinking to myself, boy, this show is dumb.

1724
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,720
This is really dumb.

1725
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:42,720
Yeah.

1726
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,720
Oh boy.

1727
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:47,280
So Steve's got a prediction that has nothing to do with giants or visitations from other

1728
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,280
worlds.

1729
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,320
And I want to make this statement.

1730
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:58,180
Seven years ago, before President Trump even obviously became president, I made this statement.

1731
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:04,280
Before God allows China and Russia to destroy the United States in a nuclear attack, he's

1732
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:08,080
going to reveal the sins of the leaders to the people and the people's sins before a

1733
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,080
holy God.

1734
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,080
Cool.

1735
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:14,280
Everybody has watched the narrative, some of the sickest SOBs on the planet.

1736
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:18,000
Those are sons of Belial, meaning Baal.

1737
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
We've seen it.

1738
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,480
We're seeing the deep state.

1739
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,720
So I guess get a bunker?

1740
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,840
I prefer the Silquarian Belial.

1741
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,840
Thank you very much.

1742
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:27,840
Yeah.

1743
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:28,840
I don't know.

1744
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,840
I guess China and Russia are going to nuke us.

1745
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,840
Yeah.

1746
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:31,840
Why?

1747
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:32,840
I don't know.

1748
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,840
Aren't they heavily invested in us?

1749
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,840
Yeah.

1750
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:35,840
I think they want us to live.

1751
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:36,840
Yeah.

1752
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:37,840
Yeah.

1753
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,840
Anyway.

1754
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:39,840
Huh.

1755
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:40,840
Weird.

1756
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,560
Steve is an insufferably annoying weirdo.

1757
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,320
No, he's doing great.

1758
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,080
I love him seven years.

1759
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,080
He's had visions.

1760
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:52,920
Listen, if I want to just hear somebody talk about being visited by God and how Belial

1761
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,520
is going to nuke the earth or whatever the fuck.

1762
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,800
I could call my wife.

1763
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,040
No, I'm fine with that.

1764
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,280
I'll listen to that.

1765
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:01,280
Sure.

1766
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,960
I'll listen to that same person tell me about Antifa.

1767
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,840
Well, there's probably that.

1768
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,680
I'm just not playing that game.

1769
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,600
Anyway, we go on to the 16th and that's Saturday.

1770
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,600
Okay.

1771
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,600
What?

1772
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:13,600
Alex has an episode on Saturday?

1773
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,600
That must be an emergency episode.

1774
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,600
Emergency.

1775
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,600
Emergency episode.

1776
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,520
I think Alex has had a little bit of time to think.

1777
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,520
Uh huh.

1778
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,720
We got a new reason that the 6th happened.

1779
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,720
There will be another reason.

1780
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:23,720
Gotcha.

1781
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,120
But that doesn't come until actually Sunday.

1782
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,120
Okay.

1783
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:30,000
But on Saturday, Alex has had some time to think after that Steve interview.

1784
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,500
I think he might not be feeling good about it.

1785
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:41,400
We all know the false flag is the scoundrel's ace in the hole.

1786
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:45,040
They're ace of spades.

1787
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,240
And now they've played it.

1788
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,560
Why isn't good governance ever their ace of spades?

1789
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,080
And it gives me a just surreal feeling.

1790
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,360
Has anybody tried that?

1791
01:14:52,360 --> 01:15:01,200
To have walked right into it.

1792
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,080
And then to have Steve Pacinek on a few days ago.

1793
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:10,840
Chortling and celebrating that fact.

1794
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,000
But not in the way he said.

1795
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,800
It's a little bit different.

1796
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,600
But see that's the thing about the globalist mindset.

1797
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:26,520
As the terrain changes and they flip sides and engage in Machiavellian behavior.

1798
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,180
They think that's intelligence.

1799
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:41,400
They think the cold, hard, social, Darwinistic way they carry it out is proof of their righteousness

1800
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,600
and it's not.

1801
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:46,680
So that seems to imply that Steve is a globalist.

1802
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,680
Yeah.

1803
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:53,640
I, what's going on here, and this will sort of play out as the episode goes along.

1804
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:57,520
Alex is saying that Steve was chortling but not in the way he seems.

1805
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,440
The way he seemed to be chortling was that Trump had won and everything was totally fine.

1806
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:06,440
The way he was actually chortling was at Alex's expense.

1807
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:12,040
Now it should be pointed out that our episode mocking the shit out of Steve's interview

1808
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:16,600
with him came out on Friday, this is Saturday.

1809
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:21,400
So I don't know if maybe, I don't know if that's what led to this emergency episode

1810
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,280
of Reflection.

1811
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,280
Probably not.

1812
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,280
I would doubt it.

1813
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,120
But Alex is kind of realizing that Steve is fucking with him.

1814
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:36,520
He is talking about 1984 and about how Emanuel Goldstein is a set up, it's QAnon.

1815
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:43,840
And then he starts talking about other characters in 1984 and how they interacted.

1816
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,880
When their torturers came in to torture them, they thought that they were actually their

1817
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,880
friends because they couldn't believe they'd been conned.

1818
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:58,600
Just like in 1984, O'Brien, and it's all just a fictional account of this, is torturing

1819
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,240
him to death.

1820
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,880
But he still thinks O'Brien's a good guy and he's like, oh, O'Brien, they got you.

1821
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:07,440
When O'Brien comes in his jail cell, he goes, O'Brien, they got you.

1822
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,440
They got you too.

1823
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:12,320
And he goes, oh, they got me a long time ago, Winston.

1824
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:17,680
See, the difference is with somebody like me, I know Paciniks and O'Brien type.

1825
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,320
I'm just observing him and watching him.

1826
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,320
I'm not Winston Smith.

1827
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,320
Oh, boy.

1828
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:22,320
Oh, boy.

1829
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,320
Oh, boy.

1830
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,320
Okay.

1831
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1832
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,560
I'm not getting manipulated.

1833
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,640
I am the master manipulator.

1834
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,280
I am observing him as in a science experiment.

1835
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,280
Yeah, you are.

1836
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:39,080
Sure, I've been doing this for 20 years and the fact that he's complimented me has allowed

1837
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:42,080
him to say whatever bullshit that he wants to.

1838
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,640
But I was observing.

1839
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,200
I was keeping a close eye on that sneaky O'Brien.

1840
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:51,160
Keep your friends close and keep your enemies closer, Dan.

1841
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,160
Yeah.

1842
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,160
Oh, boy.

1843
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,840
Ooh, this is sad.

1844
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:59,480
I am glad I'm not a narcissist and this would really, you know what, it would really fuck

1845
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:04,880
me up for a good day or two, you know, but I wouldn't need to create a mythology around

1846
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,880
it.

1847
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:10,560
I'd be like, I got had and I would learn from it and I would move on with my life and then

1848
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,160
I can't do it.

1849
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,160
And then you would bring up the Nigerian email scam.

1850
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,160
Totally.

1851
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,160
Repeatedly on air as a metaphor.

1852
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,160
Exactly.

1853
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,160
I'd be like, this has happened before.

1854
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,160
Yeah.

1855
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:20,160
Yeah.

1856
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,280
So Alex is still talking about 1984 and he gets into talking more about this Emanuel

1857
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,280
Goldstein character.

1858
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,280
Here it is.

1859
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,280
Emanuel Goldstein.

1860
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:34,840
Emanuel Goldstein is a fictional character in George Orwell's 1949 dystopian novel, 1984.

1861
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:40,120
He is the principal enemy of the state according to the party of the totalitarian Oceania.

1862
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,880
So he's just reading the Wikipedia page for Emanuel Goldstein.

1863
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,040
Did they print it out or?

1864
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,040
I'm not sure.

1865
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,040
I wasn't watching the video.

1866
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,040
All right.

1867
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:53,040
But the reason that he pauses there when he says the 1949 novel is because on the Wikipedia

1868
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:57,200
page it inaccurately says the 1984 novel, 1984.

1869
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,480
They have the year wrong.

1870
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,480
Right.

1871
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,200
So Alex was correcting that as he was reading.

1872
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,200
Sure, sure, sure.

1873
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,760
He hasn't read this and it's just a Wikipedia page.

1874
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,360
I have no interest in his analysis of 1984.

1875
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,880
Uh, no.

1876
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:15,880
Anyway, he's, he's, he's bummed out cause you know, on the one hand they got false flagged

1877
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:16,880
and he's pissed off about that.

1878
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,880
No they didn't.

1879
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,000
Well, according to him they have.

1880
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Sure.

1881
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,480
And he's experiencing that tough.

1882
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:25,160
Um, and you know, Biden's gonna be president.

1883
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,960
It's it's tough times all around for the Patriots.

1884
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:28,960
Yeah, sure.

1885
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,240
And there's literally only one solution.

1886
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,460
Thank you so much for joining us on this Saturday evening.

1887
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:38,680
The only way we stop this globalist operation and foil their storm, storm busters, is by

1888
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:43,240
you taking this live feed and the archive feed for band out video and telling everyone

1889
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:47,400
that they've got a martial law plan for the next few days and that only getting the word

1890
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,400
out can stop it.

1891
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:52,520
We need this report to get 10 million views by Monday.

1892
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:57,160
Hit your email list, hit your text message list, tell your neighbors to watch it, run

1893
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,060
down the street with a sign saying, watch it.

1894
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:04,500
The productive solution is just get me free publicity.

1895
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,500
It's dumb.

1896
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,500
Man, brutal.

1897
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,500
Yeah.

1898
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,500
It's brutal.

1899
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,500
Mike Adams is back.

1900
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:10,500
Great.

1901
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:11,500
Yeah.

1902
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,500
For an emergency episode.

1903
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:13,500
Yep.

1904
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,500
All right.

1905
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,500
So we're going to be told how we're going to die?

1906
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,500
Yeah.

1907
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,500
Okay.

1908
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,800
Uh, oh my God.

1909
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:23,080
It's very easy to know why Mike Adams is on an emergency episode.

1910
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:27,160
Mike Adams is so goddamn dramatic.

1911
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:30,160
Yeah.

1912
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:34,680
The owner of It's Over for Humanity There Will Only Be Lone Survivors is dramatic.

1913
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,580
He's like a junior high student.

1914
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:39,240
This guy is going through some things.

1915
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,040
He's the dark end wizard writing poetry all day.

1916
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,040
Yeah.

1917
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,600
It's behavior unbecoming of an adult the way he acts.

1918
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,600
It's maudlin.

1919
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:48,800
It's over the top.

1920
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,840
It's just not cool.

1921
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:53,360
It's like how you imagine Edgar Allen Poe in high school.

1922
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,200
You're like, Jesus, that guy must've been exhausted.

1923
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,200
I think more annoying, probably.

1924
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,200
Probably.

1925
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,200
There's a smaller head.

1926
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,200
There's artistic craft.

1927
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,200
That's true.

1928
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,600
Edgar Allen Poe brought to the table.

1929
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:06,560
So Mike wants to explain why there's so many troops in DC.

1930
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,200
Now my argument would be that a bunch of people stormed the capital.

1931
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,200
I don't understand.

1932
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:16,640
And, uh, you know, there's existing threats and, uh, you know, continuing people saying

1933
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:17,640
they want to do it again.

1934
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:21,800
No, I'm pretty sure that the Patreons are universally non-violent, Dan.

1935
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:22,800
That's what I've heard from them.

1936
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,800
Well, it turns out there's a whole other explanation for these troops.

1937
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:26,800
Oh, interesting.

1938
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,800
30,000 troops.

1939
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:32,000
Now, remember in Afghanistan, we only have about 3,000 troops, American troops there.

1940
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,260
So this is 10 times the size of an invasion force.

1941
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:38,840
This is using a cannon to kill a fly.

1942
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:39,840
Right.

1943
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,180
So the explanation that this is just for the inauguration is complete nonsense.

1944
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:44,480
There's something else happening.

1945
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:50,120
I've been sent photos of Patriot missile banks being set up, uh, in other States in America.

1946
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:55,800
And as you know, there, there is legitimate concern about, uh, Chinese troops in Canada,

1947
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,000
uh, Chinese troops in Mexico.

1948
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,080
This is just Q shit, man.

1949
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:05,640
Intimate concern about Chinese troops in Mexico does not sound like something I, uh, I believe.

1950
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:10,040
I don't know why there would be an amassing of troops in Washington, DC if it was in the

1951
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:13,840
Mexican border, but, uh, uh, you know, I don't know.

1952
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,840
This is just dumb.

1953
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,080
Yeah, that does sound dumb.

1954
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,080
So Mike.

1955
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,720
I would argue also one of the reasons there are so many more troops is just because it's

1956
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,400
easier to get there.

1957
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,580
You know how hard it is to get 30,000 troops to Afghanistan?

1958
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:26,080
That's a long way away.

1959
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:29,160
And hasn't Trump been scaling back the number of troops?

1960
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,160
They're more available.

1961
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:34,040
Isn't that part of Alex and Mike's narratives?

1962
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,400
So you shouldn't use that as the number.

1963
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,400
No.

1964
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,400
Anyway, who cares?

1965
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:43,280
Um, Mike has evidence of somebody who's saying that Trump is going to win.

1966
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,680
Uh, they're a CIA shill.

1967
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:49,520
I think he's talking about Steve Pacino.

1968
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,640
I don't know though, because he won't make names.

1969
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:58,400
There are some bad faith actors that, uh, even in the last 24 hours, I was able to...

1970
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,560
Confirm a particular bad faith actor.

1971
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:05,000
I don't want to mention any names, but someone who had fooled a lot of people with online

1972
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:10,540
videos that were popular saying that, no, Trump's going to be sworn in on the 20th.

1973
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:12,600
That person is a CIA operative.

1974
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:17,380
I've been able to acquire his ID number working at the CIA.

1975
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:18,880
So that's an op.

1976
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:25,080
If you had evidence that somebody was running operations and you had definitive proof they

1977
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:28,280
worked for the CIA, like you would put that out.

1978
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,520
You would have to put that out.

1979
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,160
You'd have to think that like, it's probably dangerous for me to have the, I mean, that's

1980
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:34,520
what Alex would say, right?

1981
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:35,520
That's what Alex says all the time.

1982
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,720
If you have this information, you have to get it all out.

1983
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:38,720
Yeah.

1984
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:39,720
Otherwise you're dead.

1985
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,720
Yeah.

1986
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:41,720
Yeah.

1987
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:42,720
I mean, isn't that, isn't this the Mission Impossible?

1988
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:48,000
If you identify an undercover operative, that's the biggest thing that will get you killed

1989
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,560
until you release that information.

1990
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:50,560
Yeah.

1991
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,560
That's the whole movie.

1992
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:54,400
The only thing that can protect you is coming out with that information.

1993
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,400
Exactly.

1994
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,400
Yeah.

1995
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,400
So I think this is about Steve.

1996
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,400
Yeah.

1997
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:03,200
Anyway, uh, we have some pretty serious things on the horizon.

1998
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,200
Sure.

1999
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:07,960
There's possible Chinese invasions, uh, also another threat to consider.

2000
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,960
Okay.

2001
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:14,440
I'm very, very concerned that the deep state is going to set off a dirty bomb in a US city.

2002
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,440
Sure.

2003
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,640
And they're going to blame that on Patriots.

2004
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:20,680
And that's why they're desperately knocking on doors looking for somebody to recruit.

2005
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:25,520
Somebody who actually has a history of appearing on videos and podcasts and so on talking about

2006
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,760
guns or Trump or what have you.

2007
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:28,760
You?

2008
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:29,760
Yeah.

2009
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:30,760
Yep.

2010
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,080
All of this stuff is you.

2011
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,500
You realize this is you.

2012
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,760
Are you speaking to a mirror?

2013
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:39,920
Are you threatening to dirty bomb me?

2014
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,200
I am, I am loving all of these.

2015
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:46,560
I'm concerned about what they're going to say the Patriots do because part of me is

2016
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,560
like, do you guys think the Patriots are capable of building a dirty bomb?

2017
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:52,680
Cause that concerns me.

2018
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,000
I think they definitely are.

2019
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,680
I mean, what's that Oathkeeper guy who was arrested a couple of years back with a napalm

2020
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:58,680
bomb.

2021
01:24:58,680 --> 01:24:59,680
Yeah.

2022
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:00,680
Yeah.

2023
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:03,440
I think, uh, I think what we're all really hearing from these people is, Oh my God, I'm

2024
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,840
worried about what we created.

2025
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:05,840
Yeah.

2026
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,840
It might be out of control.

2027
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:13,640
This, uh, uh, you know, this thing is an uncontrollable, completely out of line group that we thought

2028
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,320
would just be fun.

2029
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,320
Yeah.

2030
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:21,700
Unfortunately all of our fanfic about history didn't warn us about what real history would

2031
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,080
have warned us about an uncontrollable mob.

2032
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:27,600
I think it's kind of like me starting the year of the seltzer.

2033
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,600
Sure.

2034
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,600
I thought it would be good fun.

2035
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:30,600
Right.

2036
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:34,920
And I thought that, you know, we'd just have seltzers and I'd try them and it got out of

2037
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:35,920
hand.

2038
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,280
You picked a, you went 500 is too big and a year is too long.

2039
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,280
Yeah.

2040
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,280
It's an unwieldy amount of time.

2041
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:45,040
It's an unwieldy amount of seltzer and requires commitment.

2042
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,560
I had it for a long time.

2043
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,160
I'm not saying it's over.

2044
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,240
We still got the fiscal year's end.

2045
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:53,880
I created something that I thought was fun and it was fun.

2046
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:54,880
It was a lot of fun.

2047
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,520
They had a lot of momentum for a while.

2048
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:57,520
It was great.

2049
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,520
But it was uncontrollable.

2050
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,680
Flagged a little bit and then it came back.

2051
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:01,680
It's still back.

2052
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:02,680
It's still back.

2053
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,680
It's uncontrollable.

2054
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:04,680
Let's say you can't just force it.

2055
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:05,680
Yeah.

2056
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:10,560
This metaphor doesn't work, but, uh, neither does democracy, apparently, because Mike has

2057
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,760
to tell you the country has fallen.

2058
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,160
This guy is so dramatic.

2059
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,160
Sure.

2060
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:18,400
Well, the rule of law has collapsed in this nation and whether you're arrested just depends

2061
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,680
on which side you're working for.

2062
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:25,080
So, uh, if you're, if you're a pro-Trump patriot, you're going to be considered guilty no matter

2063
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,180
what you're doing.

2064
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:29,660
If you're a radical leftist, you can throw Molotov cocktails and set fire to federal

2065
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:32,980
buildings and burn police cars and shine lasers at federal agents.

2066
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:33,980
In your mythology.

2067
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:37,620
Or you'll be arrested and the charges will be dropped within 24 hours by a George Soros

2068
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:40,700
funded district attorney in your local city.

2069
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:44,340
So we have now entered the era of complete lawlessness.

2070
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:49,820
There is no controlling legal authority that is legitimate in this nation, which means

2071
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:52,120
the constitutional republic has fallen.

2072
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,120
Damn.

2073
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,120
Wow.

2074
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:55,120
That happened.

2075
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:56,120
Yeah.

2076
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,120
Wow.

2077
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,120
Big news.

2078
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,120
Yeah.

2079
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,120
That's a real bummer.

2080
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,120
Huge if true.

2081
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,120
Yeah.

2082
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,120
I love all the...

2083
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,120
There is no legitimate legal authority in America anymore.

2084
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,800
Well, I mean, I guess that would mean it's game on, right?

2085
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:12,420
I mean, all the things that would stop you from doing things like storming the Capitol,

2086
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:13,420
that would be laws.

2087
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:14,420
Yeah.

2088
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:15,420
And there's no legitimate legal authority.

2089
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:16,420
And the constitutional republic has fallen.

2090
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:17,420
Wow.

2091
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:18,420
I mean, I guess the...

2092
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:19,740
Do what thou wilt, if you will.

2093
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:21,660
As Mike is saying, smoke them if you got them.

2094
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:22,660
Yeah.

2095
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:23,660
Yeah.

2096
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:24,660
Yeah.

2097
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:25,660
It does feel like that.

2098
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:31,500
It reminds me so much of all those 2021 articles where it's like, cops have been proven to

2099
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:35,780
hurt leftists at three times the rate of white nationalists.

2100
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:43,400
And it's like, guys, I'm glad that you have new hard data, but come on, this is America.

2101
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:47,440
We didn't need a new Guardian article in 2021.

2102
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:51,980
We had Guardian articles in 1914 saying the exact same thing.

2103
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:52,980
All right.

2104
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:53,980
But it's good to have more articles.

2105
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:54,980
Sure.

2106
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:58,540
But you could have just put up a picture of the flag and been like, see, this is what

2107
01:27:58,540 --> 01:27:59,540
we do.

2108
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:00,540
Fair enough.

2109
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:07,700
Now, one thing you're not going to see an article about is the evil eye.

2110
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,380
I don't think that's true.

2111
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:14,420
I once saw a documentary about this guy who actually had magical powers.

2112
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:17,180
He could hypnotize people with his evil eye.

2113
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:18,500
With his evil eye.

2114
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:19,500
Yeah.

2115
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:20,900
He was like a really rich dude.

2116
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:22,620
Was it narrated by Vincent Price?

2117
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:24,500
No, it was this really rich guy.

2118
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,380
He had a great mustache.

2119
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:27,380
I think...

2120
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:28,380
Mesmer?

2121
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:34,260
I remember that one of his employees was a guy who would watch films and then review

2122
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:37,420
them poorly.

2123
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:41,220
That guy who was the film reviewer, his son went to the UN school.

2124
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:43,220
Oh, that's strange.

2125
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:46,660
Dr. Demento?

2126
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:49,100
Please tell me that you know what I'm talking about.

2127
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:50,100
No clue.

2128
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:51,100
The critic.

2129
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:52,100
Was that the critic?

2130
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:53,100
Yeah.

2131
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:54,100
Duke Phillips.

2132
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,100
Oh, man.

2133
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:56,100
He could hypnotize people with his evil eye.

2134
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:57,100
You were referencing Duke Phillips.

2135
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:58,100
I forgot about the evil eye.

2136
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,100
Oh, shit.

2137
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,460
Look into my evil eye.

2138
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:01,460
That's right.

2139
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:02,460
He could do that.

2140
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:03,460
I should have said something about the...

2141
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:04,460
He had country bears.

2142
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:07,460
Yeah, that's what I would have...if you'd said he has the country bears.

2143
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:09,620
We're the bears who sing for Duke.

2144
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:11,460
So, yeah.

2145
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:12,460
Evil eye.

2146
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:13,460
Yes.

2147
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:14,460
Apparently is a real thing.

2148
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:17,860
I don't want to have a George W. Bush moment with you where he said, you know, I think

2149
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:18,860
Putin's a good guy.

2150
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:19,860
I looked in his eyes.

2151
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:22,820
He has a soul I can trust, but everybody knows it's the eyes.

2152
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:24,660
Everybody knows it's the wind of the soul.

2153
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:30,480
I look at your eyes and I see a serious, intelligent, focused person that's really concerned.

2154
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:33,580
You look at my eyes, you basically see the same thing.

2155
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:39,300
I look at the eyes and it's increasingly worse at the grocery store or in public.

2156
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:43,300
And I'm seeing more and more agitated, crazy looking people that look like schizophrenics

2157
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:44,540
or demons.

2158
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:48,940
And let's just put a photo up of a composite of some of the Democrat leaders' eyes.

2159
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:51,340
And folks, it's not like we're cherry picking photos.

2160
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:56,220
It's every photo of them, they look like they are from another dimension.

2161
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,220
Back this out.

2162
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:59,620
I mean, I've met some of these people.

2163
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:02,100
I've been in rooms with these people.

2164
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:05,380
And what is it about the eyes?

2165
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:06,380
What is going on?

2166
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:13,020
I know you study the medical issues, the 5G, the GMO, all of it.

2167
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:18,900
But what is causing people to look like this and to act like this?

2168
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:19,900
Medical weed.

2169
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,140
In this case, it's not a medical issue.

2170
01:30:21,140 --> 01:30:22,180
It's a spiritual issue.

2171
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:24,780
They are demonically infested.

2172
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:25,780
That's no joke.

2173
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:27,180
It's not an exaggeration.

2174
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:32,980
There are actual demon or demonic entities that are possessing these people.

2175
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:37,740
And then what happens is the body, the physical body begins to mirror the internal dark spirit

2176
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:38,740
structure.

2177
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:40,460
This is the health ranger.

2178
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:48,380
If you don't understand what led to the situation on the 6th that you created and fucking caused,

2179
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:51,100
this is what you would say.

2180
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:56,380
Your political enemies are literally demon possessed and the constitutional republic

2181
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:58,060
has fallen.

2182
01:30:58,060 --> 01:30:59,060
You are not fighting-

2183
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:00,900
It's not responsible rhetoric.

2184
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:01,900
Bananas.

2185
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:02,900
Bananas.

2186
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:03,900
Bananas.

2187
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:08,420
I just think it's funny that this guy runs a natural news alternative medicine site and

2188
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:11,860
he's sitting here on air talking about how people's eyes can tell you if there are demons

2189
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:13,500
inside them.

2190
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,060
That's another thing.

2191
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:17,500
Lead every article about Mike Adams with this.

2192
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:21,460
Mike Adams, who believes you can see demons in eyes.

2193
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:22,460
I'd hate for him to look at me.

2194
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:23,460
I have a cross eye.

2195
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:24,460
What would he think about me?

2196
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:25,460
Oh, you're a demon.

2197
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:27,260
I obviously would say something terrible about me.

2198
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:28,820
I mean, the cross eye is the sign of the demon.

2199
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:30,860
I was born this way.

2200
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:31,860
With a demon.

2201
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:32,860
Oh.

2202
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:33,860
Sorry.

2203
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:37,860
So dumb.

2204
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:38,860
These people are stupid.

2205
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:42,680
So anyway, Alex starts talking about Steve and I would say that he describes Steve kind

2206
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:45,580
of like how you might describe a lunatic.

2207
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:46,860
Let's talk about Steve Pacinek here.

2208
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:48,980
I've been interviewing him for 19 years.

2209
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,140
He is a big spook.

2210
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:54,660
He was involved in a lot of incredible stuff and he did help write Tom Clancy's novels

2211
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:58,980
and he has that twisted side where he laughs at you and says, you know, oh, we co-opted

2212
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:02,660
you and he exaggerates and, you know, does all that condescending stuff.

2213
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:06,780
But he's an interesting guy, so I have him on, but he's done a lot of good things.

2214
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:09,900
Exposing 9-11 as an inside job and wow.

2215
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:13,460
All right.

2216
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:15,860
You fired David Knight.

2217
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:17,740
Jesus.

2218
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,620
You dumb motherfucker.

2219
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:23,460
It hasn't even been that long since he fired him.

2220
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:24,900
Really has not.

2221
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:27,140
It really has not.

2222
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:29,940
It's such a great turnaround too.

2223
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:31,340
So fast.

2224
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:36,740
It's like if David Knight was like a goddamn Twilight Zone twist.

2225
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:41,780
If David Knight wasn't so boring, like this could be a huge boost to his career.

2226
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:42,780
Totally.

2227
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:49,060
No, his credibility would go off the charts if anyone were still listening.

2228
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:54,620
I did actually listen to a video of David Knight talking about Steve after, I believe

2229
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:59,340
it was after the 6th, and I was like, man, scathing stuff.

2230
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:00,340
So boring.

2231
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:01,340
Yeah.

2232
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:02,340
Couldn't even get any clips from it.

2233
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:03,340
No.

2234
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:05,460
But he does say that Alex fired him because of Steve.

2235
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:06,460
Well, yeah.

2236
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:10,980
And he says that Alex doesn't care about anything except traffic to the site.

2237
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:11,980
Well, yeah.

2238
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:12,980
Well, yeah.

2239
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:13,980
Damn.

2240
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:14,980
Coming with them boring swings.

2241
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:16,980
Jesus, David Knight.

2242
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:19,380
Thanks for speaking obvious to power.

2243
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:24,700
So Mike and Alex get to wrestling with the idea that Steve made this bet about the election

2244
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:28,500
and like how if he's wrong, it doesn't matter because then he can never come back on the

2245
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:29,500
show again.

2246
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:35,740
This is fucking 1910s people discussing like, well, if she is a witch, then unfortunately

2247
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:36,840
we're going to have to burn her.

2248
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:37,840
But we don't know yet.

2249
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,820
You got to look her in the eye.

2250
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:44,220
What Pacenik was promising you, what I noticed about that, he made a bet with you and you

2251
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:47,900
were going to offer to employ him if he's right and he was going to offer to never come

2252
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:48,900
on your show again.

2253
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:49,900
If he's wrong.

2254
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:54,020
Well, there's no downside for him to offer that because this is this.

2255
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:56,420
If he's if he's playing us, it's his final play.

2256
01:33:56,420 --> 01:33:57,660
He will never want to come on your show.

2257
01:33:57,660 --> 01:34:00,960
He was laughing at me and was very obvious that was the final play.

2258
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,700
But I knew weeks ago that's what he was doing.

2259
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:04,260
I know I predict it's the final play.

2260
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:05,260
That's why you fired David.

2261
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:10,100
And I'm going to demand he come back on whenever what he said doesn't come true.

2262
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:11,100
Yeah.

2263
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:14,540
You know, if Biden's sworn in, he can he can just say no and what are you going to do?

2264
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:16,260
You know, go find them and put them on camera.

2265
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:17,260
No, no shit.

2266
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:18,260
Yeah, no shit.

2267
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:19,260
Why?

2268
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:21,820
By the way, it's not the final play.

2269
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:24,220
Steve will be back in like a couple of course.

2270
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:25,220
Pretend this didn't happen.

2271
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:26,220
It didn't.

2272
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:27,980
I've done this rodeo too many times.

2273
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:28,980
No kidding.

2274
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:32,660
I guess this is a little more severe than other times, though, because like, it's clear

2275
01:34:32,660 --> 01:34:34,140
Alex's feelings are hurt.

2276
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:35,140
Oh, severely.

2277
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:36,860
But he's hurt Alex's feelings in the past.

2278
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:37,860
Sure.

2279
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:40,380
I just haven't heard him be like, I've been using you, man.

2280
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:41,380
I know.

2281
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:42,380
That one's too good.

2282
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:43,380
That was great.

2283
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:44,380
That was just too good.

2284
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:45,380
Mm hmm.

2285
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:46,660
That eclipses four stars for sure.

2286
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:47,660
Yep.

2287
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:48,660
Yep.

2288
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:49,660
Not as pithy, though.

2289
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:50,660
Not as much of a soundbite.

2290
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:51,660
No, that's true.

2291
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:52,660
That's true.

2292
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:55,260
So Mike is worried about a dirty bomb, worried about Chinese invasion.

2293
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:56,260
Sure.

2294
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:58,060
And he also is worried about anyone going to protest.

2295
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:59,060
OK.

2296
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:00,060
Don't do it.

2297
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:01,060
All right.

2298
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:04,380
To everyone listening, do not participate in any of these capital protests.

2299
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:08,780
Not that there are really any actually being organized by patriot groups, but don't participate

2300
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:09,780
in those.

2301
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:13,180
If you go to the capital, this is all false flag operation you're being set up.

2302
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:17,700
What you can do is legally and lawfully prepare to defend your home, your family and your

2303
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:22,780
local neighborhood or community against any kind of aggression that may that may happen

2304
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:27,500
if the left believes they can carry out a local uprising and go door to door killing

2305
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,580
people like what happened in the Cultural Revolution in China.

2306
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:32,060
And that's a very real possibility.

2307
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:33,660
This guy is so dramatic.

2308
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:36,020
This is this is painful to listen to.

2309
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:37,620
Do these people not hear themselves?

2310
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:39,660
Like I know they don't care about words.

2311
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:44,460
I know they don't care about the words that they say, but I cannot imagine listening to

2312
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:49,300
somebody who tells me that my political enemies are literal demons.

2313
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:54,140
And then in the same breath tells me that I shouldn't protest.

2314
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:58,260
Don't do anything but barricade your doors.

2315
01:35:58,260 --> 01:35:59,820
Don't do the protesting because that's a trap.

2316
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:04,260
But you should be ready to kill people who are coming door to door totally to kill conservatives.

2317
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:09,540
I mean, we are going to have a dearth of Jehovah's Witnesses if they go to the south.

2318
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:10,860
Oh, no, I wouldn't do it.

2319
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:14,420
So Alex is worried about migration.

2320
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:16,900
He's worried about immigrants coming in.

2321
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:21,140
I can't believe we can just change topics to immigration right now.

2322
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:22,620
He has an interesting theory.

2323
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:27,260
By interesting, I mean, absurd and probably motivated by racism.

2324
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:29,600
You look at Europe and the model they want here.

2325
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:34,280
Every home they say is going to take a African or Middle Eastern migrant, then that's a spy

2326
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:38,760
on your house that works for the U.N. so they can do whatever they want and further break

2327
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:39,760
down your home.

2328
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:43,060
I mean, this is literally the takeover of civilization.

2329
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:44,060
That's messed up.

2330
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:48,820
I don't know why you would assume that any immigrant that you allow and agree to have

2331
01:36:48,820 --> 01:36:54,020
in your home out of the charity of your own heart would be a U.N. spy.

2332
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:55,020
Yeah.

2333
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:56,020
Cool.

2334
01:36:56,020 --> 01:37:01,840
You could just say, OK, well, first off, you could say no to this, I imagine.

2335
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:08,720
But second, if you do have somebody in your home, don't they know how insanely hostile

2336
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:10,220
you are towards them?

2337
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:13,460
Wouldn't they have some idea?

2338
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:18,380
Or even the government who's like, OK, we're going to put you in all of these homes, one

2339
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:21,300
per home, but not this one.

2340
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:24,180
Those people are going to kill you.

2341
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:25,180
Yeah.

2342
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:27,420
It doesn't seem like it's in anyone's best interest.

2343
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:28,420
No, it's not.

2344
01:37:28,420 --> 01:37:29,420
Yeah.

2345
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:34,540
It's a paranoid fantasy of white nationalist types like Alex, and that's all.

2346
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:35,700
They're U.N. spies, though.

2347
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:39,580
Yeah, we can't quarter soldiers in our homes, God damn it.

2348
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:40,580
Keep that in mind.

2349
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:41,580
Oh, of course.

2350
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:42,580
Because that might come back.

2351
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:43,580
Naturally.

2352
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:46,940
So Alex was sort of going down this path, but he gets distracted by thinking about Steve

2353
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:47,940
again.

2354
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:49,300
He doesn't like that Steve-

2355
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:50,300
He really hurt his feelings.

2356
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:51,820
Yeah, because Steve was laughing at it.

2357
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:52,820
Yeah.

2358
01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:56,340
So we'll track this together in what could be the final shows.

2359
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:01,260
I mean, you heard Mike, like you said, this could be your last time coming on.

2360
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:04,740
Steve Quayle said that, but notice Pacenik thought it was funny about, oh, yeah, just

2361
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:05,740
don't worry.

2362
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:11,260
I won't be coming back on your show probably again, ha ha ha ha, because, you know, very

2363
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:15,700
maniacal or because I don't think he's delusional.

2364
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:20,280
And I think he knows something really, really big is coming up here.

2365
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:24,660
And then he wants to just put that last laugh in of, oh, and by the way, Jones, thanks for

2366
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:27,260
helping us get martial law with what happened to the Capitol.

2367
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:31,260
I think that Steve was laughing at Alex, but I think he's also delusional.

2368
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:32,260
Yeah.

2369
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:33,260
The problem with the way that-

2370
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:34,260
They're not exclusive.

2371
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:35,260
No.

2372
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:36,260
But they are for someone like Alex.

2373
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:37,260
That's true.

2374
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:42,060
Because he's built up Steve over the years far too much to sort of penetrate the facade

2375
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:46,020
of like the fake version of him that he's presented to the audience, which is really

2376
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:50,620
easy for someone like you or me because we're like, this guy is crazy.

2377
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:55,800
He's a very high functioning, very smart, delusional person who has forest gumped himself

2378
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:59,340
into every single historically important thing.

2379
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:04,020
And Alex has just allowed him to do that and reinforce his credibility over and over and

2380
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:05,260
over and over again.

2381
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:07,860
And now it doesn't look so good.

2382
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:08,860
Yeah.

2383
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:14,180
It's not like Steve is a pathological liar that is aware of his pathology and is laughing

2384
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:16,500
at you for buying anything that he says.

2385
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:17,500
He might be.

2386
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:24,740
He's a liar, he's a pathological liar who is laughing at you for not believing his lies.

2387
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:25,740
Maybe both.

2388
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:26,740
Yeah.

2389
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:27,740
And you know what?

2390
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:31,580
Steve wasn't like laughing at Alex when he said he wouldn't come back on his show.

2391
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:32,580
He was being dismissive.

2392
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:33,580
Yeah.

2393
01:39:33,580 --> 01:39:35,580
He was like, well, if I'm wrong, I'm not coming on your show.

2394
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:38,020
Don't have me on your show anymore.

2395
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:41,020
He was asserting confidence more than anything.

2396
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:48,420
I think it's so funny how much Alex condescended to the Q shaman who is a fan of his, who believes

2397
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:51,560
almost identical shit to Steve Pechenik.

2398
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:55,500
And then how much he got his ass handed to him by Steve Pechenik, who is supposed to

2399
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:56,500
be his friend.

2400
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:57,500
Yup.

2401
01:39:57,500 --> 01:39:59,900
And the Q shaman is going to prison.

2402
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:04,460
Maybe that's why these people just exist is because it's not possible for them to have

2403
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:06,180
good relationships with people.

2404
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:08,220
Like they simply cannot do it.

2405
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:15,700
What they believe is friendship is exploitation and what they believe is a love or affection

2406
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:18,100
is actually a secret plot to kill them.

2407
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:22,740
Well, I mean, you know, I'm quoting Pete Santilli here, you know, everybody in the right wing

2408
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:26,620
is they're just waiting for the right bidder to sell you out.

2409
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:27,620
Ain't that the truth?

2410
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:29,100
Ain't that the truth?

2411
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:35,780
So at this point on this emergency Saturday broadcast, Alex gets into what I would describe

2412
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:39,760
as incredibly familiar territory.

2413
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,380
My goal, I woke up about 3 a.m. this morning and couldn't sleep.

2414
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:45,660
And you know, you're so clear at like 3 a.m. when you've went to bed at like 8, I went

2415
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:48,660
to bed early, got up at like 3 a.m., had some coffee and I was really clear, was out on

2416
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:49,660
the back porch.

2417
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:53,560
You look at the mist and I thought, I need to go on air tomorrow like it's my last show

2418
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:55,580
ever and say that to people.

2419
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:56,860
And then I forgot to do that.

2420
01:40:56,860 --> 01:40:58,480
You just said that.

2421
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:01,860
And so people download this to hard drive, save it.

2422
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:05,460
This show, next week's show, literally there's a good chance it's our last show.

2423
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:06,460
It's not drama.

2424
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:07,460
Okay.

2425
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:10,340
So Mike, speak to that and then after you're gone, I'll have my messages if it's my last

2426
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:14,580
show because this is the knowledge now that if they just have this knowledge in the future,

2427
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:15,840
they're going to win and beat the globalists.

2428
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:19,600
We did this already.

2429
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:20,820
This is so frustrating.

2430
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:21,820
Yeah.

2431
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:22,820
You know why?

2432
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:28,700
Because it was a running bit on our show because he kept saying this and then on November 24th,

2433
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:29,700
he actually did it.

2434
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:30,700
Yep.

2435
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:31,700
And it was sad.

2436
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:32,700
Yep.

2437
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:33,700
It was a failure.

2438
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:34,700
Complete.

2439
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:35,700
It was a great failure.

2440
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:36,700
Fucked up.

2441
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:37,700
Yep.

2442
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:38,700
And I understand why he'd want to do it over.

2443
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:39,700
Oh yeah.

2444
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:40,700
Just call them all again.

2445
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:41,700
But it's just so annoying.

2446
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:42,700
Nothing.

2447
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:43,700
Nothing matters.

2448
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:45,820
We, we did the payoff for this joke already.

2449
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:46,980
Why are you doing it again?

2450
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:48,060
Why are you hurting me?

2451
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:49,060
Yeah.

2452
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:50,060
This feels like it's personal.

2453
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:51,060
This is a personal attack.

2454
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:55,600
I'm not a good enough comedian to pull off doing this joke again.

2455
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:57,660
We already did the season.

2456
01:41:57,660 --> 01:41:58,660
Totally.

2457
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:04,680
We've, we've like, look, I had one joke that I told for longer than three years.

2458
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:07,900
And even that was a little bit too long.

2459
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:09,740
This was, this is over.

2460
01:42:09,740 --> 01:42:10,740
We move on.

2461
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:11,980
We write new material.

2462
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:12,980
We got to go.

2463
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:14,600
Alex, you're a hack.

2464
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:15,600
You're a hack.

2465
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,600
It is.

2466
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:17,600
It's hacky.

2467
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,600
It's hacky.

2468
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:21,780
It's like, okay, you're a writer for home improvement, right?

2469
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:23,220
I don't know why this came into my head.

2470
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:25,020
Maybe it's because Tim Allen's a conservative dude.

2471
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:26,020
Sure.

2472
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:27,760
Tim Allen is the star of the show.

2473
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:33,540
So there's an episode that you do and like a season later, he insists that you do the

2474
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:39,420
same story and pretends or seems to not be aware that you've done this story already.

2475
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:43,380
And now you got to try and find a way to make this episode happen because he's the fucking

2476
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:48,080
star and what he says goes, now you got to try and make it funny again that Alex is doing

2477
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,700
his goddamn fake last broadcast again.

2478
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:51,700
I'm, I'm, I'm furious.

2479
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:52,700
It's terrible.

2480
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:53,700
Just terrible.

2481
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:57,580
If there's one thing that does work and is really funny, it's that Mike Adams is taking

2482
01:42:57,580 --> 01:43:00,420
it very seriously because he is very dramatic.

2483
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:02,420
He's a dramatic man.

2484
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:04,100
He's like, it is such an honor to be here.

2485
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:05,100
Oh my God.

2486
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:06,100
No, no.

2487
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:07,100
Yeah.

2488
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:08,100
Come on.

2489
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:09,100
Yeah.

2490
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:10,600
You fucking.

2491
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:11,600
It's really silly.

2492
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:12,600
All right.

2493
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:15,500
And so he gets to talk to you about how, and all this goes down, right?

2494
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:21,920
When the fascist state that comes and puts us all into a bind, once that falls, people

2495
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:28,940
like Alex, people like Mike and the info warriors will be needed to rebuild society.

2496
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:33,580
The evil fascist regime will eventually fall.

2497
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:35,060
It will fall under its own arrogance.

2498
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:40,820
It will fall under its own mistakes under the weight of its own deception.

2499
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:44,700
It will eventually fall as many evil regimes have fallen in the past.

2500
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:54,900
You know, we defeated the third Reich, the USSR fell, and this American, I can't even

2501
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:59,720
call it American, this globalist coup against America will not last forever.

2502
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:00,720
It will fall.

2503
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:05,940
And when it does fall, it's people like you and I and the listeners to the show who will

2504
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:14,260
be necessary to rebuild the next society in the image of Christian principles and values

2505
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:19,940
with added new freedoms that weren't in the original bill of rights, such as health freedom,

2506
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:24,860
the right to always say no to medical interventions, to say no to vaccines, to say, Medicare for

2507
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:26,500
none.

2508
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:31,820
That right, which was, I think, Dr. Benjamin Rush, wasn't it?

2509
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:36,060
Who wanted to put that in the initial bill of rights, but it didn't make it in there.

2510
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:38,660
We need that to be the third amendment, for example.

2511
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:43,300
You know, we need the first amendment, freedom of speech and religious expression, second

2512
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:46,580
amendment, but we need a third amendment, freedom, health freedom.

2513
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:48,460
You always have the right to control your own body.

2514
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:50,380
The government can never force anything upon you.

2515
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:54,420
I mean this sincerely, I don't know if Mike Adams knows there's already a third amendment.

2516
01:44:54,420 --> 01:44:57,180
I genuinely agree with you.

2517
01:44:57,180 --> 01:44:58,540
One hundred percent believe you.

2518
01:44:58,540 --> 01:45:02,140
That means he might not know about the other ones after it.

2519
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:03,140
That's fucking scary.

2520
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:06,860
I'll tell you the one that he definitely doesn't want to know about.

2521
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:09,740
Anyone that involves slavery.

2522
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:12,260
Some of those later ones he's probably a little bit iffy on.

2523
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:14,100
Very against.

2524
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:16,020
That was weird.

2525
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:20,600
I don't, I mean like I understand that he dwells in a media space that really obsesses

2526
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:23,940
about the first and second.

2527
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:25,900
I mean the third is pretty important too.

2528
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:26,900
That's that quartering soldiers one.

2529
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:32,340
Yeah, I was going to say, I really remember that being quartering soldiers, but then I,

2530
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:33,340
see this is the problem.

2531
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:37,940
Whenever people like him say stuff so insanely confident and I'm, I have to be like, I swear

2532
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:43,600
to you, I know what this is, but there's a question for one second of like, maybe I just

2533
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:44,660
mistook it.

2534
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:45,660
Maybe I could be wrong.

2535
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:47,200
It could be the sixth amendment.

2536
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:48,260
Maybe I don't know.

2537
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:52,460
Even if you're in this extreme right wing world, like there was a real long stretch

2538
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:56,380
of time during Obama's presidency where they were obsessed with the 10th amendment, you

2539
01:45:56,380 --> 01:46:00,460
know, about state's rights and all that nonsense.

2540
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:06,060
And so like, I don't, I don't understand, like, I mean it would be so easy just to say

2541
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:09,580
we need another amendment instead of a third.

2542
01:46:09,580 --> 01:46:10,580
Jesus.

2543
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:11,580
Oh boy.

2544
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:17,260
There are, the people who have spent so much time slapping a constitution, telling you

2545
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:21,980
to read it, and putting it in their pocket have never read it and definitely couldn't

2546
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:23,140
understand it if they did.

2547
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:27,020
Also, I think that Mike's imagined health freedom amendment would guarantee access to

2548
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:28,940
reproductive health care, including abortion.

2549
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:29,940
No, no, no, no.

2550
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:32,260
It would guarantee the right to not have access to those.

2551
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:35,900
I know that he's considering that like, it's like a thing where the government can't force

2552
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:39,200
you to have medical things done, but wouldn't you also want to make sure the government

2553
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:43,600
can't force you to not have any medical procedure you think is necessary done?

2554
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,300
That seems like an important element of health freedom.

2555
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:47,700
These people are fundamentally stupid.

2556
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:48,900
I just can't stand it.

2557
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:52,300
I hate, I hate this dramatic weirdo.

2558
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:55,500
This guy is so weird, he thinks evil eyes exist.

2559
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:59,100
I just, I just don't know.

2560
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:09,420
I love the deadpan, just junior high guy going through puberty, kind of like, everything

2561
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:14,060
is so serious, kind of delivery of, they're gonna dirty bomb us.

2562
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:17,300
It's an honor to be here with you, Alex, on your last show.

2563
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:21,660
After the fall of the American fascist state, people like you and me will be needed to rebuild

2564
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:22,660
society.

2565
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:23,660
Oh god.

2566
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:29,020
Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the a-slings and arrows of outrageous dirty

2567
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:30,020
bombs.

2568
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:31,020
Yeah.

2569
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:37,340
So now Alex is supposed to be doing his last episode thing here, but instead he has Robert

2570
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:39,300
Barnes on.

2571
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:40,860
That would be his last episode.

2572
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:45,420
Barnes just talks more shit about Q. He's just on to talk more nonsense about Q.

2573
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:46,420
I hate him.

2574
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:50,620
But he's talking about, okay, so Barnes is laying out like what QAnon did.

2575
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:54,540
And one of the things that they did was they, they targeted certain groups.

2576
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:59,940
Now, if you listen to this, it sounds almost identical to the Infowars business model.

2577
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:06,220
They also targeted three groups in particular, QAnon targeted first, people that otherwise

2578
01:48:06,220 --> 01:48:10,060
are crowdsourcing grassroots investigative journalists.

2579
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:14,020
Second, they targeted soldiers and ex soldiers.

2580
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:20,300
Third, they targeted cops and ex cops and people that also were religious.

2581
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:24,100
So there are people that are accustomed to believing in a source of authority independent

2582
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:28,620
of and separate from the state, incorporated references to religious rhetoric, incorporated

2583
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:32,940
references to Bible verses, incorporated references to God.

2584
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:35,980
This is gnostic, gnostic Roman cult stuff.

2585
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:36,980
Explain that.

2586
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:38,500
You're describing Infowars.

2587
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:42,780
That should be his last broadcast because it's Barnes explaining what Alex does.

2588
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:43,780
Yeah.

2589
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:44,780
More or less.

2590
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:45,780
Unreal.

2591
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:48,500
So Alex gets to complaining about the FBI.

2592
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:52,900
If this was Shakespeare, he would give that soliloquy and then immediately be stabbed.

2593
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:54,620
That is how this works.

2594
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:55,620
Okay.

2595
01:48:55,620 --> 01:48:59,860
So Alex is talking about the FBI and he's made a big deal about how they're like saying

2596
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:01,820
that he caused the uprising.

2597
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:05,060
He planned the storming of the Capitol.

2598
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:07,780
He comes clean a little bit about what they actually had questions about.

2599
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:08,780
Sure.

2600
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:09,780
Let me bring this up to you now.

2601
01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:10,780
I'm talking about myself.

2602
01:49:10,780 --> 01:49:14,340
The FBI contacted our security people, wanted to bring them in, wanted to talk to them.

2603
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:15,340
Oh, we don't care about Alex.

2604
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:16,340
We want to talk to you.

2605
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:18,420
And then we refused to get lawyers.

2606
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:20,680
And so they go, okay, don't worry about it.

2607
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:23,420
We just got false reports that you guys were in the Capitol.

2608
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:24,420
Just tell us you weren't in the Capitol.

2609
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:25,740
Yeah, we weren't in the Capitol.

2610
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:31,500
So, so Sam was, your camera man was, he was doing a plug when he went in.

2611
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,740
Do you know how we know that?

2612
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:34,740
It's on your website.

2613
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:35,820
On your website.

2614
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:38,660
It is being broadcast on your website.

2615
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:40,940
I got it from bam.video.

2616
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:47,060
Also, if I were the FBI, I too would be like, let's talk to your security people.

2617
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:48,060
Not you.

2618
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:49,060
You lying piece of shit.

2619
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:50,060
Yeah.

2620
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:51,060
I've seen your depositions.

2621
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:52,060
You're not helpful.

2622
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:53,060
Yeah.

2623
01:49:53,060 --> 01:49:54,060
No, no.

2624
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:56,980
We did hire Larry Klayman for this one though, so it's pretty exciting.

2625
01:49:56,980 --> 01:50:01,700
Alex talked to Barnes about how bad Q is for a while and it's annoying.

2626
01:50:01,700 --> 01:50:07,500
And then he gets on his own and he reads a fake Cicero quote.

2627
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:08,500
Okay.

2628
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:13,540
He reads a real, uh, quote, uh, his favorite quote, the man in the arena.

2629
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:14,540
Okay.

2630
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:16,620
The, uh, uh, Teddy Roosevelt quote.

2631
01:50:16,620 --> 01:50:17,620
Yeah.

2632
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:22,900
The bystanders and the, the, the, the reviewers, they matter not the man in the arena, he falters

2633
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:23,900
and that is okay.

2634
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:24,900
All right, Teddy.

2635
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:25,900
That kind of shit.

2636
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:26,900
All right, Teddy.

2637
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:28,340
He does, he reads that quote so much.

2638
01:50:28,340 --> 01:50:30,860
I think it's the only thing that gives his life meaning anymore.

2639
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:31,860
Yeah.

2640
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:32,860
Yeah.

2641
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:35,460
Then he goes a little bit off track.

2642
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:36,460
Okay.

2643
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:39,860
So we got, we got Roosevelt.

2644
01:50:39,860 --> 01:50:40,860
We got Cicero.

2645
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:41,860
Sure.

2646
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:47,940
And now this, then a friend of mine sent me this text message this morning, subject forwarded

2647
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:53,940
from a friend, a man named Tom Nicholson posted on Facebook, his account, the sports car that

2648
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:55,300
he had just bought.

2649
01:50:55,300 --> 01:51:00,540
Now a man approached and told him that the money used to buy the car could have fed thousands

2650
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:06,140
of less fortunate people, but the industry and the factories that built it also built

2651
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:10,660
the factories that built the tractors, dumb ass, and also built the desire for people

2652
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:14,700
to have nicer things that then to build a desire for better medicine and better technology

2653
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:15,700
and a better future.

2654
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:16,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

2655
01:51:16,700 --> 01:51:17,700
I'm not ready.

2656
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:22,940
When he said his response to the man made him famous on the internet, read a story as

2657
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:28,380
stated on Facebook below, a guy looked at my Corvette the other day and said, I wonder

2658
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:33,300
how many people could have been fed for the money that sports car cost.

2659
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:35,780
I replied, I'm not sure.

2660
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:39,500
It fed a lot of families in Bowling Green, Kentucky who built it.

2661
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,180
It fed the people who made the tires.

2662
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:44,460
It fed the people who made the components that went into it.

2663
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:47,940
It fed the people in the copper mine who mined the copper for the wires.

2664
01:51:47,940 --> 01:51:52,060
Alex is reading a chain email that your grandma would send you.

2665
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:53,060
Yup.

2666
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:54,060
This is nuts.

2667
01:51:54,060 --> 01:51:56,340
Uh, yeah, I believe this is the meme.

2668
01:51:56,340 --> 01:52:02,440
This is the same meme that it's like the military man was in the professor's room and the professor

2669
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:08,300
was like, war is bad and the military man stood up and was like, I hate liberals.

2670
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:09,940
And then it was outrageous.

2671
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:10,940
Yeah.

2672
01:52:10,940 --> 01:52:11,940
I was like, I don't know.

2673
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:12,940
Fuck off.

2674
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:14,260
I thought this was supposed to be your last broadcast.

2675
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:15,520
You're reading a chain email.

2676
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:17,220
What is going on?

2677
01:52:17,220 --> 01:52:19,020
You know, I said this would be my last broadcast.

2678
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:23,500
It really could, but I, it's just too heavy of a subject to say this is my last broadcast

2679
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:25,780
and then do it here.

2680
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:28,940
I'm just too tired already, but I'm going to write some notes tonight and tomorrow and

2681
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:32,580
come on the Sunday show four to 6 PM and give you my view on the world.

2682
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:34,340
So Sunday's going to be the last show.

2683
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:35,340
So here we go.

2684
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:36,340
Let's do the last show.

2685
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:38,300
That's catnip to you, Dan.

2686
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:39,300
It is.

2687
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:40,300
Yes.

2688
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:41,300
And that's why we have to include Sunday.

2689
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:42,300
Of course.

2690
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:43,300
But we're not done with Saturday yet.

2691
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:44,300
Oh God.

2692
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:50,300
Saturday ends in just a remarkable way for anybody who really thinks that Alex Jones

2693
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:54,320
is like, sincerely religious, enjoy.

2694
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:58,700
So I will end the transmission with this, the Lord's prayer.

2695
01:52:58,700 --> 01:53:02,080
Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done

2696
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:03,820
on earth as is in heaven.

2697
01:53:03,820 --> 01:53:07,180
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.

2698
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:11,380
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the

2699
01:53:11,380 --> 01:53:13,060
power of the glory forever.

2700
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:14,060
Amen.

2701
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:15,060
All right.

2702
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:17,780
I appreciate the crew.

2703
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:18,860
I appreciate their work.

2704
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:23,380
I would just ask the listeners, I don't know how long we're going to be on air.

2705
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:24,700
We got great products you need.

2706
01:53:24,700 --> 01:53:27,860
A lot of them are about to sell out winter sun for your immune system.

2707
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:29,340
It's about to sell out.

2708
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:33,460
I don't know about the Lord's prayer going that quickly into an ad, but Jesus went into

2709
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:36,700
the temple and said, guys, get the fuck out of here.

2710
01:53:36,700 --> 01:53:39,700
I am selling t-shirts.

2711
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:43,940
That's interesting because Alex is also selling a t-shirt and we have this new shirt designed

2712
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:49,820
by one of our veteran friends that says trader Joe's and it's got Joe Biden with China and

2713
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:54,100
Russia and Ukraine and Iran that he sold us out to says trader Joe's.

2714
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:55,100
It's a fun shirt.

2715
01:53:55,100 --> 01:54:00,180
It's fun info wars.com in all sizes for adults and children.

2716
01:54:00,180 --> 01:54:03,300
And so I suggest you get the shirt at info war store.com.

2717
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:07,180
It's a limited edition shirt and it lets us have a little bit of fun with the new puppet

2718
01:54:07,180 --> 01:54:11,580
dictator that they are installing.

2719
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:13,740
That's why Steve Pacinich said, oh, it's my last show with you.

2720
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:15,060
Cause it's the jokes on me.

2721
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:18,660
He thinks, or he really believes what he's saying and he thinks he's going to get a job

2722
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:22,660
here if somehow Biden designs and Trump's the president.

2723
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:26,540
Well, yeah, he's got a job here if that moonshot happens.

2724
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:27,540
Wow.

2725
01:54:27,540 --> 01:54:32,100
People want to listen to Pacinich anyways, interesting guy, but I think he's a little

2726
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:33,900
more on the devil side of the angel side.

2727
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:42,460
And I'll tell him that the way he talks down to people, the way those guys act like they're

2728
01:54:42,460 --> 01:54:44,580
the big gosh, they're in the system.

2729
01:54:44,580 --> 01:54:45,780
I'm the outsider.

2730
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:47,520
I'm not the system.

2731
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:51,940
That's who I'll always be because I'm here changing the system and that's my job.

2732
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:53,660
Not to be part of the system.

2733
01:54:53,660 --> 01:54:54,660
Okay.

2734
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:55,660
Again, great job to the crew.

2735
01:54:55,660 --> 01:54:57,940
He seems really mad.

2736
01:54:57,940 --> 01:55:05,840
I hate, I hate how comfortable these people are with demons existing on our plane and

2737
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:11,900
running things to the point where you would be like, Hey, here's a fun t-shirt about this

2738
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:14,660
demon that's running the world.

2739
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:15,660
Yeah.

2740
01:55:15,660 --> 01:55:16,660
Yeah.

2741
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:20,460
It is, it is a little bizarre for him to be like, we made this pun t-shirt so we could

2742
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:22,060
have a little fun with the dictator.

2743
01:55:22,060 --> 01:55:23,060
It's the devil!

2744
01:55:23,060 --> 01:55:24,060
Yeah.

2745
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:25,060
It's a satanic globalist dictator.

2746
01:55:25,060 --> 01:55:26,060
Oh man.

2747
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:27,060
It's very weird.

2748
01:55:27,060 --> 01:55:28,060
That's so annoying.

2749
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:29,060
That's so annoying.

2750
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:37,020
A demon is an existential threat and you're like, eh, we'll make this fun little t-shirt.

2751
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:38,820
So we're on to Sunday now.

2752
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:39,820
Sure.

2753
01:55:39,820 --> 01:55:40,820
Last broadcast.

2754
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:41,820
Final broadcast ever.

2755
01:55:41,820 --> 01:55:43,900
This bit is finally going to be put to rest.

2756
01:55:43,900 --> 01:55:49,940
Well, Alex can't get to it right away because there's news and he has a new group to blame

2757
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:52,180
for what happened on the sixth.

2758
01:55:52,180 --> 01:55:55,340
Now we knew it was Antifa that told you that the day of the event.

2759
01:55:55,340 --> 01:55:56,340
After?

2760
01:55:56,340 --> 01:56:00,620
He told you who the operator was, where he came from in Utah, how he led over a hundred

2761
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:02,340
Antifa addresses to Trump supporters.

2762
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:03,340
A hundred?

2763
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:04,340
When?

2764
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:05,340
What?

2765
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:08,320
I saw folks that didn't look like meth head Antifa on the videos.

2766
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:10,120
I got there about 30 minutes after it started.

2767
01:56:10,120 --> 01:56:12,500
My employees.

2768
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:16,560
That looked like right wingers, you know, that didn't look like they'd been grown in

2769
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:17,560
their mother's basement.

2770
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:18,560
It looked like I employed them.

2771
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:24,540
It looked like that actually had some steak and potatoes and dumb little fight.

2772
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:27,380
And sure as hell we identified who they were.

2773
01:56:27,380 --> 01:56:30,060
They were telling the crowd they were proud boys, but I checked them.

2774
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:31,780
They weren't proud boys.

2775
01:56:31,780 --> 01:56:34,780
They were boogaloo's.

2776
01:56:34,780 --> 01:56:37,420
No.

2777
01:56:37,420 --> 01:56:39,140
Boogaloo boys going under the bus.

2778
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:40,140
No.

2779
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:41,140
Slaps.

2780
01:56:41,140 --> 01:56:42,140
Slaps all around.

2781
01:56:42,140 --> 01:56:43,140
Yep.

2782
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:44,740
Got to throw, uh, throw the boogaloo boys overboard.

2783
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:45,980
Oh man.

2784
01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:50,220
I really like how Alex said boogaloo's there.

2785
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:51,220
Boogaloo's.

2786
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:53,140
He really, he really enjoyed it.

2787
01:56:53,140 --> 01:56:54,140
He really did.

2788
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:55,140
Yeah.

2789
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:56,140
He really did.

2790
01:56:56,140 --> 01:56:57,140
Yeah.

2791
01:56:57,140 --> 01:57:01,060
So apparently this is how he's going to get around the fact that there were a bunch of

2792
01:57:01,060 --> 01:57:06,060
people who were oath keepers and are in trouble.

2793
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:07,060
Yeah.

2794
01:57:07,060 --> 01:57:10,340
I assume Stuart Rhodes isn't on this Sunday broadcast.

2795
01:57:10,340 --> 01:57:15,220
Alex is going to soon be making up a story about Stuart Rhodes wife getting run over.

2796
01:57:15,220 --> 01:57:18,100
That's something about their dog.

2797
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:19,100
Yeah.

2798
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:20,500
Cause he's going to be in hiding.

2799
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:21,500
Oh boy.

2800
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:25,060
Anyway, Alex has a new video of the boogaloo boys.

2801
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:26,060
Sure.

2802
01:57:26,060 --> 01:57:29,300
Oh God, this is so funny.

2803
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:35,060
Like Alex, he is so bad at this, this whole thing.

2804
01:57:35,060 --> 01:57:39,180
And it's just so incredible because you try to get this out, the only place it gets out

2805
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:40,180
is here.

2806
01:57:40,180 --> 01:57:41,860
Gateway Punnett's got an article about it, you name it.

2807
01:57:41,860 --> 01:57:43,060
But now it's very clear.

2808
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:44,060
Wait, what?

2809
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:50,060
I don't know what happened, but let's hit the first big one I just told you about.

2810
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:51,060
You can bet your bottom dollar.

2811
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:54,460
You'll be seeing this on Tucker Carlson tomorrow night because Tucker's the first one to send

2812
01:57:54,460 --> 01:57:55,460
it to me.

2813
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:57,380
I don't leave it at that.

2814
01:57:57,380 --> 01:58:00,780
But you know, those that are in fight club, don't talk about flight club.

2815
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:04,220
You know, the second rule of fight club, don't talk about fight club, but I send him stuff.

2816
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:05,220
He sends me stuff.

2817
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:06,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2818
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:09,140
That's exactly against the rules of flight club.

2819
01:58:09,140 --> 01:58:10,620
I just, I just, that's

2820
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:18,780
I don't know if I could come up with a more Alex Jones sentence than Tucker Carlson sent

2821
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:19,780
me this clip.

2822
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:20,780
I'm going to leave it there.

2823
01:58:20,780 --> 01:58:21,780
You just said everything.

2824
01:58:21,780 --> 01:58:22,780
Yep.

2825
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:24,060
There is nothing more to say.

2826
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:25,060
Nope.

2827
01:58:25,060 --> 01:58:27,340
This clip was sent to you by Tucker Carlson.

2828
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:31,660
And if that's true, that tells us all we need to know about Tucker Carlson.

2829
01:58:31,660 --> 01:58:33,940
I'd love to get a comment from Tucker on that.

2830
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:34,940
Absolutely.

2831
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:39,460
Because I would imagine he would not admit to sending information to Alex.

2832
01:58:39,460 --> 01:58:41,060
I don't think he would like it.

2833
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:46,220
On account of fight club being ruled as don't talk about fight club.

2834
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:47,220
Yeah.

2835
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:49,540
And so, I mean, I would imagine that he would say, no, I didn't.

2836
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:53,820
And then Alex would have to wrestle with why no one will be publicly associated with him.

2837
01:58:53,820 --> 01:58:55,900
But they'll have his employees on their shows.

2838
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:56,900
Yeah.

2839
01:58:56,900 --> 01:59:03,820
Anyway, at this point, we've now decided that the Boogaloo boys are going to be blamed for

2840
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:06,500
anybody who appears to be right wing.

2841
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:10,800
So we got Antifa for people who don't feel right wing and we got Boogaloo for people

2842
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:11,800
who are wrong.

2843
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:13,220
And QAnon for people who are weird.

2844
01:59:13,220 --> 01:59:14,220
Right.

2845
01:59:14,220 --> 01:59:15,220
Even though...

2846
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:16,220
Sure.

2847
01:59:16,220 --> 01:59:17,220
Yeah.

2848
01:59:17,220 --> 01:59:18,220
Fine.

2849
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:22,700
So now that that's settled, it's time to go back to familiar territory.

2850
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:24,180
Let's play this next.

2851
01:59:24,180 --> 01:59:29,900
Over 7,000 strong migrant caravan inches closer to the US border as Biden vows to end Trump

2852
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:30,900
asylum.

2853
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:33,580
And this will be hundreds of thousands if not millions like hit Europe.

2854
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:34,580
It's the UN plan.

2855
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:39,180
As soon as they knew Biden would let him in, they began the march out of a UN camp in Honduras

2856
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:40,180
into Guatemala.

2857
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:41,180
Here it is.

2858
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:46,140
So, yeah, the migrant caravan narratives are back.

2859
01:59:46,140 --> 01:59:49,940
Just, just, just do it.

2860
01:59:49,940 --> 01:59:55,800
Take four years off and run reruns where you just edit in Biden over Obama.

2861
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:56,940
It's going to be the same thing.

2862
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:58,940
There'll be a lot of similarities.

2863
01:59:58,940 --> 02:00:03,800
Think about how much time you can take off if you're just going to recycle the same shows.

2864
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:04,800
Let's run reruns.

2865
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:05,800
Yeah.

2866
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:11,740
I really, I hope that you have drafts of all of your articles from the Obama days.

2867
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:13,220
Save those Google docs.

2868
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:14,220
Yeah.

2869
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:19,780
So, yeah, man, migrants are coming to America and it's a UN plan that is war.

2870
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:20,780
Why not?

2871
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:25,180
War doesn't look like it did in Vietnam or Korea or the Gulf war.

2872
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:26,380
This is modern war.

2873
02:00:26,380 --> 02:00:28,780
This is globalist war against the nation state.

2874
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:32,380
So wear your mask and take your vaccines and roll over and die.

2875
02:00:32,380 --> 02:00:35,340
Remember this submission only makes it worse.

2876
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:37,100
This is the end of America.

2877
02:00:37,100 --> 02:00:40,180
In the next two years, the country will not exist.

2878
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:41,180
Guaranteed.

2879
02:00:41,180 --> 02:00:47,980
I mean, almost kind of feels like you're saying a good answer would be to storm the Capitol.

2880
02:00:47,980 --> 02:00:48,980
Yeah.

2881
02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:49,980
Yeah.

2882
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:50,980
It does sound like we are at war.

2883
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:51,980
Yeah.

2884
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:55,920
And the enemy is demons trying to bring in immigrants.

2885
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:59,460
That sounds some suspiciously like white nationalists talking.

2886
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:00,460
Oh, big time.

2887
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:02,300
It really feels like that's white nationalists.

2888
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:03,300
Oh, really?

2889
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:04,300
Yeah.

2890
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:08,900
Just part of the great replacement, the great migration, the UN uses people as a weapon.

2891
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:09,900
They turn their food off.

2892
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:11,120
They turn their jobs off.

2893
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:14,900
You just think you're staying home for a few months and okay, it's a vacation.

2894
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:18,060
No, it's collapsing the border.

2895
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:21,400
When you become poor, the third world starves to death.

2896
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:24,300
When the first world collapses, the third world dies.

2897
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:29,380
How many times did I drill that into your head?

2898
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:36,020
And now in Europe and now in the US everywhere, the borders are collapsing and giant third

2899
02:01:36,020 --> 02:01:39,860
world populations that don't have jobs and don't have infrastructures are coming here

2900
02:01:39,860 --> 02:01:41,860
to do what?

2901
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:44,120
Collapse the infrastructure.

2902
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:45,860
First they get you to not go to work.

2903
02:01:45,860 --> 02:01:47,720
Next they get you to say you're not essential.

2904
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:49,460
Next they shut down main street.

2905
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:51,580
Next they shut down the side streets.

2906
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:56,660
Then they come in and tell you that you've got to open your borders up because the third

2907
02:01:56,660 --> 02:02:00,940
world starving to death and mass and then they get here and they're organized into political

2908
02:02:00,940 --> 02:02:06,020
weapons and political groups that from the beginning were trained for up to a year in

2909
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:15,060
a UN refugee camp in Marxist, Leninist ideology projected by Mark Zuckerberg, projected by

2910
02:02:15,060 --> 02:02:20,060
Jeff Bezos, projected by all them on record commanding it.

2911
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:21,060
That's quite a sentence.

2912
02:02:21,060 --> 02:02:22,060
Uh, yeah.

2913
02:02:22,060 --> 02:02:26,420
You know, you had any concerns that it might not be a white nationalist thing.

2914
02:02:26,420 --> 02:02:27,420
Yeah, I wasn't.

2915
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:28,420
Certainly.

2916
02:02:28,420 --> 02:02:29,420
Certainly.

2917
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:30,420
Really made it pretty clear there.

2918
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:31,420
Let's put it bad.

2919
02:02:31,420 --> 02:02:35,180
Now I would say that, I mean, we've been over this territory so many times in the past when

2920
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:38,220
he's gotten into the, the past caravan narratives.

2921
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:43,980
Now this is, is very much based on a white identity fear.

2922
02:02:43,980 --> 02:02:44,980
Totally.

2923
02:02:44,980 --> 02:02:51,700
Now I would say that the behavior that he's engaging in and the way that he's framing

2924
02:02:51,700 --> 02:02:55,860
a lot of these ideas are very dangerous.

2925
02:02:55,860 --> 02:03:01,180
They are the sort of things that I do think sound a lot like incitement towards violence

2926
02:03:01,180 --> 02:03:04,400
of people that you suspect might be immigrants.

2927
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:05,820
This is the takeover.

2928
02:03:05,820 --> 02:03:10,420
This is modern warfare using giant third world starving hordes that have been put in the

2929
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:14,820
position of starvation or invasion and the UN is going to manage with the left every

2930
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:17,880
damn bit of it and they're going to swamp your red city.

2931
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:21,500
They're going to swamp your red town and they're going to take your ass over cause you're under

2932
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:23,060
military attack.

2933
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:31,300
I don't know what you would expect the outcome of that to be other than like rank xenophobia

2934
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:37,700
and the possibility of violence directed towards people that are determined to be immigrants

2935
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:39,700
whether or not they actually are.

2936
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:42,660
Followed by a sign at every border that says whites only.

2937
02:03:42,660 --> 02:03:45,860
Yeah, it's, it's pretty bad.

2938
02:03:45,860 --> 02:03:51,300
It's not unfamiliar territory for Alex certainly, but I just constantly end up getting in a

2939
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:55,780
position where like the world is really like serious.

2940
02:03:55,780 --> 02:04:00,820
You know, like I, I just don't understand how Alex can not be living in a world of reflection

2941
02:04:00,820 --> 02:04:06,940
about how serious things are and how unhinged people are and how, how dangerous we are in

2942
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:10,240
a mis, like a misinformed populace.

2943
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:17,580
People are living outside the prism of reality and I don't believe that he is a committed

2944
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:22,540
believer of the things that are distorted reality.

2945
02:04:22,540 --> 02:04:23,540
Absolutely not.

2946
02:04:23,540 --> 02:04:25,980
He's, he's, he's monetized it.

2947
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:30,180
He's exploiting the fact that other people are living in the fake reality that he preaches.

2948
02:04:30,180 --> 02:04:31,180
Yeah, I was going to say.

2949
02:04:31,180 --> 02:04:34,780
So he wouldn't be able to operate if he actually believed the things that he's saying.

2950
02:04:34,780 --> 02:04:35,780
Of course not.

2951
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:37,040
He wouldn't be able to work.

2952
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:38,940
He wouldn't be able to do any of this shit.

2953
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:44,380
He would be dead by now because he would have stormed the Austin Capitol 10 years ago.

2954
02:04:44,380 --> 02:04:45,380
Totally.

2955
02:04:45,380 --> 02:04:47,940
It's not, it's, it's nonsense.

2956
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:52,420
And I, I, I just constantly think like, well now we'll take it seriously.

2957
02:04:52,420 --> 02:04:53,420
And he just never does.

2958
02:04:53,420 --> 02:04:54,420
He never does.

2959
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:57,240
No, it's, I mean, yeah, it's, it's hard to say any of that.

2960
02:04:57,240 --> 02:05:00,580
You know, when you ask like, how do these people not take it more seriously?

2961
02:05:00,580 --> 02:05:02,140
And it's just like scream.

2962
02:05:02,140 --> 02:05:04,520
I just, MONEY!

2963
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:05,520
It's MONEY!

2964
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:07,100
It can't matter that much though.

2965
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:08,100
It does!

2966
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:09,100
I guess.

2967
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:10,100
It matters so fucking much.

2968
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:11,100
I guess.

2969
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:14,920
Anyway, Alex gets to talking about how his enemies are ugly and they want to kill you

2970
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:19,020
and he rambles a bit about this and then he's just, I don't know.

2971
02:05:19,020 --> 02:05:22,520
I would say that this is an incitement towards violence too.

2972
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:29,180
And it's all weird, disreputable creatures because that's all they can get because there's

2973
02:05:29,180 --> 02:05:35,700
such virtue in humanity that no good looking, no well-spoken, no honorable man will even

2974
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:37,180
serve this.

2975
02:05:37,180 --> 02:05:40,960
But it still doesn't matter because just because honorable men don't take the field and don't

2976
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:44,640
join the enemy, the enemy goes great because you didn't join the fight.

2977
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:49,060
And the fight is informational, it's cultural, it's spiritual, and it's about boycotting and

2978
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:53,660
it's about information war and it is about noncompliance.

2979
02:05:53,660 --> 02:05:56,160
It is about civil disobedience and it won't matter.

2980
02:05:56,160 --> 02:05:59,800
They're going to hurt you so bad because they have a nature, like a child molester has got

2981
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:02,540
to rape a child or a murderer has got to kill.

2982
02:06:02,540 --> 02:06:06,980
They just have this drive and this desire and they've got to have power over you and

2983
02:06:06,980 --> 02:06:10,960
they got to inject you and they got to shut your farm down and they got to shut your business

2984
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:15,680
down and they got to see their stock go up at Amazon and they just got to do it and they

2985
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:20,240
just got to put you down, they can't help it.

2986
02:06:20,240 --> 02:06:25,240
And they're going to go and go and go and go and go, they can't ever stop until you

2987
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:26,240
stop them.

2988
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:28,720
They can't stop until you stop them.

2989
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:29,720
Wild.

2990
02:06:29,720 --> 02:06:30,720
Wild.

2991
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:31,720
Yeah.

2992
02:06:31,720 --> 02:06:34,880
It's not a good look overall.

2993
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:35,880
You know what I've always thought?

2994
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:44,280
I've always thought that the Democrats secret weapon could be governing the country well

2995
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:50,120
and they refuse to do that for the same reason Alex refuses to take the six seriously.

2996
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:51,800
Money!

2997
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:57,880
If you material improved the lives of the, I just, I'm just running my, I'm losing my

2998
02:06:57,880 --> 02:06:58,880
mind.

2999
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:06,880
Um, and if you think that Alex is solely driven by money, um, then I would suggest that this

3000
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:10,520
must be what everyone keeps telling him to do more of.

3001
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:13,680
Humpty Dumpty, Brian Stelter, we're like a hundred thousand viewers.

3002
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:14,680
He led her bitches.

3003
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:15,680
No one watches me.

3004
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:16,680
Well, no kidding, dude.

3005
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:17,680
You look like a child molester.

3006
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:22,920
I'm not saying you are one, but I mean, I'm not letting you babysit my kids, bro.

3007
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:23,920
You molest the truth.

3008
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:24,920
I'm sorry.

3009
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:25,960
Let's go back to them.

3010
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:26,960
Both are happening.

3011
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:29,720
Both are from the same platforms and the same pro-Trump media outlets.

3012
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:30,720
Both are problematic.

3013
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:33,900
Um, Chris, what do you say to the following?

3014
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:37,640
We have to be clear eyed about what is a domestic terror threat, but also very careful not to

3015
02:07:37,640 --> 02:07:38,680
exaggerate it.

3016
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:39,680
Not to overstate it.

3017
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:40,680
We're on this again.

3018
02:07:40,680 --> 02:07:41,680
We're on it in 10 seconds.

3019
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:42,680
There's a domestic terror threat.

3020
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:43,680
It's called your speech.

3021
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:46,360
Oh, they killed four Americans at the Capitol.

3022
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:48,240
There was a riot, a small riot.

3023
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:51,220
It's the worst thing since Pearl Harbor.

3024
02:07:51,220 --> 02:07:52,220
You're a child.

3025
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:53,900
Well, we gotta be careful not to exaggerate it.

3026
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:55,180
He plays all these games.

3027
02:07:55,180 --> 02:07:57,320
Let's go back to this shack of puss.

3028
02:07:57,320 --> 02:08:01,200
It's interesting because it was supposed to be his fake last show again, and it is fitting

3029
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:07,360
that he would do an entire segment complaining about a Brian Stelter piece on his fake last

3030
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:09,640
show because that should go in the time capsule.

3031
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:10,640
Totally.

3032
02:08:10,640 --> 02:08:11,640
100%.

3033
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:14,840
It has been a while since he's done one of these where he just plays a Brian Stelter

3034
02:08:14,840 --> 02:08:18,160
interview that's just uncontroversial.

3035
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:19,680
Just a completely normal...

3036
02:08:19,680 --> 02:08:24,360
Yeah, I was listening to it and I was like, first of all, he's not saying the things that

3037
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:25,840
Alex is responding to.

3038
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:28,600
Second, it is not a hot take.

3039
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:34,240
It is a pretty soft conversation about misinformation online.

3040
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:38,360
You would take Brian Stelter to just a regular old like, hey, how have you been?

3041
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:43,520
And turn it into a 10 minute long, this is why he's a demon who mouths the truth.

3042
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:44,520
Look at his eyes.

3043
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:45,520
Oh, God.

3044
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:50,480
So anyway, for old time's sake, here's a minute 40 of Alex just getting really mad at Stelter.

3045
02:08:50,480 --> 02:08:54,220
We have to be clear eyed about what is a domestic terror threat, but also very careful not to

3046
02:08:54,220 --> 02:09:02,000
exaggerate it, not to overstate it, not to create undue fear in this country right now.

3047
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,280
I think that's absolutely right.

3048
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:05,480
We've got to be very careful here.

3049
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:10,520
Just because someone may believe that the president did not win the election or the

3050
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:15,320
president elect Biden did not win or that someone believes in QAnon doesn't mean that

3051
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:18,700
they're going to go pick up arms and pause again.

3052
02:09:18,700 --> 02:09:21,400
It's like we're outlawing him questioning the election, but we don't put them in the

3053
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:23,020
FEMA camp right away.

3054
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:24,020
Did he say that?

3055
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:25,020
Did anybody say that?

3056
02:09:25,020 --> 02:09:26,020
No.

3057
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:27,020
What are we talking about here?

3058
02:09:27,020 --> 02:09:28,020
Oh, we don't.

3059
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:29,020
We just shut them down.

3060
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:30,020
And then, oh, we kill them.

3061
02:09:30,020 --> 02:09:33,560
This is all psychological scripts they're reading.

3062
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:36,520
Super predatory, super dangerous, super evil.

3063
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:37,520
Continue.

3064
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:38,520
Is that possible, Alex?

3065
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:43,640
Will there ever be a solution, a real clear, full solution to this information crisis that

3066
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:47,420
has been perpetuated in my view by platforms like the one you're used to work face?

3067
02:09:47,420 --> 02:09:50,040
Is there a final solution, he's asking?

3068
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:54,480
Like, how do we deal with these people that, like, you know, saw them with suitcases in

3069
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:58,680
Georgia, pulling them out and closing things and saying the water main broke and then all

3070
02:09:58,680 --> 02:10:04,360
these Biden votes come in and it happened and all, you know, Biden can't get 20 people

3071
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:05,360
that Trump gets a million.

3072
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:07,080
But, you know, what do we do?

3073
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:08,080
What's the solution?

3074
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:09,080
We're going to come back.

3075
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:10,080
I'm going to be nice.

3076
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:12,680
I'm going to play the clip unedited because by edited, I'm jumping in.

3077
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:13,680
I'm talking over.

3078
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:18,320
It's just it's hard to look at someone with no viewers, but it doesn't matter.

3079
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:19,320
It's what the banks.

3080
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:22,140
They know that the globalist word is through Stelter.

3081
02:10:22,140 --> 02:10:23,480
That's Jeff Zucker.

3082
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:27,200
And so here is this, this, this, this Hitler, this Stalin, this Mao.

3083
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:31,800
I mean, they call us that he's the one trying to stealth everybody.

3084
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:34,080
It's Brian Stelter.

3085
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:35,080
He's Hitler.

3086
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:36,080
I'm not.

3087
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:40,740
Look, I'm not saying he's not a public figure or he hasn't accomplished anything.

3088
02:10:40,740 --> 02:10:42,960
I'm just saying he's Brian Stelter.

3089
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:44,600
Yeah, he's Hitler.

3090
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:48,120
He's Brian Stelter is the voice of the globalists.

3091
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:49,120
Really?

3092
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:51,840
The voice of the globalists, Brian Stelter.

3093
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:57,800
I hate how small potatoes everybody who's a big deal is to these people.

3094
02:10:57,800 --> 02:11:03,280
I think it's fascinating because, you know, like if this is the pretend last show, it

3095
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:04,280
makes sense.

3096
02:11:04,280 --> 02:11:10,600
I mean, like all day, Alex hates Brian Stelter for reasons that I can't quite figure out,

3097
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:16,000
except that Brian Stelter has mentioned Alex a couple of times and he comes off as a less

3098
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,200
than Alex's definition of masculine man.

3099
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:20,200
Sure.

3100
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:23,040
And I think that that bothers Alex on some level.

3101
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:24,040
Right.

3102
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:29,080
It feels like he's been emasculated by a less masculine man in Alex's eyes.

3103
02:11:29,080 --> 02:11:31,400
And just saying that Alex is a dumb-dumb.

3104
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:36,900
And because I don't think that Brian Stelter lets Alex live in his mind, whereas Alex is

3105
02:11:36,900 --> 02:11:40,000
clearly thinking about Brian Stelter all the time.

3106
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
All the time.

3107
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,000
He's curious about him.

3108
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,680
Yeah, he hate watches Brian Stelter so much.

3109
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:44,680
He has to.

3110
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:49,640
And you see this, like, just to come out on the show, these outbursts, it's amazing.

3111
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:52,240
I'm so glad that I've passed my Friedersdorf stage.

3112
02:11:52,240 --> 02:11:53,800
Yeah, well, you had to get it out of your system.

3113
02:11:53,800 --> 02:11:56,000
I had my time and now it's over.

3114
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
You processed it.

3115
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Yeah.

3116
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Unhealthy, healthy.

3117
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Yeah, yeah, I got through it.

3118
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Yeah.

3119
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Yes.

3120
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,360
So Alex comes back from break and he promises, I'm not going to interrupt now.

3121
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:12,320
And they're just, I mean, this is so textbook 1984 and you're just watching these criminals

3122
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:14,560
talk about it, but I'm not going to interrupt them.

3123
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:16,120
Just go ahead and play it unedited.

3124
02:12:16,120 --> 02:12:18,680
Just play a few minutes of this.

3125
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:19,680
I'm going to try to shut up.

3126
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:20,680
Go ahead.

3127
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:21,680
Five.

3128
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:25,680
We have to work on the broader disinformation problem to try to turn down the anger that

3129
02:12:25,680 --> 02:12:29,880
you see from that huge percentage of Republicans who believe that the election was stolen.

3130
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:30,880
It's yeah.

3131
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:31,880
I'm sorry.

3132
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:32,880
Stop it.

3133
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:33,880
Ooh.

3134
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:34,880
I was really close.

3135
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:35,880
I was really close.

3136
02:12:35,880 --> 02:12:36,880
It was 10 seconds.

3137
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:39,520
I should have done the countdown.

3138
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:40,520
So he's unsuccessful.

3139
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:43,520
He just, oh God, is so much Stelter.

3140
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:49,760
So he's talking about, uh, how like we're at war to not be enslaved.

3141
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:50,760
Jesus.

3142
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:57,640
There comes a point when powerful organizations and groups decide to make their move, no matter

3143
02:12:57,640 --> 02:13:00,040
what happens, they're committed to the fight.

3144
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:01,360
It has a name.

3145
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:02,840
It's called war.

3146
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:07,960
We are now under open globalist attack.

3147
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:11,160
The United States did not see the sneak attack.

3148
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:13,880
I tried to warm people for decades.

3149
02:13:13,880 --> 02:13:17,320
People going back to Barry Goldwater, Cleon scouts, and some of the others warned before

3150
02:13:17,320 --> 02:13:21,040
I was even born, but Americans were arrogant.

3151
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:26,040
They believed that we were so strong, we could not fall.

3152
02:13:26,040 --> 02:13:35,360
We had major rot from within, and now we face the prospect of slavery and massive persecution

3153
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:41,320
and the full thrust of the globalist attack at levels never before seen.

3154
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:44,360
That's why tomorrow I'm going to do a special transmission.

3155
02:13:44,360 --> 02:13:46,400
Don't you fucking dare.

3156
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:50,120
Is this Alex Jones' last broadcast?

3157
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:51,840
Because every day now is precious.

3158
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:53,440
Go fuck yourself, man.

3159
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:55,680
I'm not doing this.

3160
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:58,920
I'm not going to be strong along by the likes of you.

3161
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:00,320
I want to start fires.

3162
02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:01,560
I want to start fires.

3163
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:03,520
I don't want to start building fires.

3164
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:08,600
I want to start large brush fires just in the street, just to let everyone know what

3165
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:09,600
is happening.

3166
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:10,600
Yeah.

3167
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:12,960
Alex is doing another viral broadcast.

3168
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:14,960
Like I'm sending smoke signals up.

3169
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:19,400
There's too many people who are unaware that he is doing this again.

3170
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:21,040
It's so annoying.

3171
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:24,840
I need someone to know that he is doing this again.

3172
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:31,360
It's so annoying, too, because he did nothing but waste time on this Sunday show.

3173
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:34,400
There's so much just like, it's the Boogaloo Boys.

3174
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:36,440
That's who we don't like now.

3175
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:38,000
Tucker Carlson's my source.

3176
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Whoops, Fight Club.

3177
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Yeah.

3178
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,000
And then yelling about Stelter.

3179
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Stelter.

3180
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Helter Stelter hate.

3181
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
I got blisters on my fingers.

3182
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Oh my god.

3183
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Yep.

3184
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:50,240
I'm so tired, dude.

3185
02:14:50,240 --> 02:14:53,280
There's this last clip here from Sunday is fitting.

3186
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:55,920
This is kind of how Alex wraps up the show.

3187
02:14:55,920 --> 02:15:02,920
And I will say that it is exciting for me because now on Friday, on our show, we will

3188
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:05,480
finally get his actual- Sure, sure we will.

3189
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:06,480
Of course.

3190
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:07,480
Of course.

3191
02:15:07,480 --> 02:15:08,480
Of course.

3192
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:09,480
Of course.

3193
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:10,480
Last episode.

3194
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:11,480
Yeah.

3195
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:12,480
But here's how Alex goes out on the seventh.

3196
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:13,480
Just perfect.

3197
02:15:13,480 --> 02:15:17,520
But I'll just recap what we started the show with before I have this important information.

3198
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:22,800
We know the Boogaloo's left this group with a few hundred people, staged the attack.

3199
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:26,240
Only the Q folks were dumb enough to go in to get media attention.

3200
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:27,240
And your employees.

3201
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:31,360
It was Q people that went in non-violently to be set up and arrested.

3202
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:32,360
And your employees.

3203
02:15:32,360 --> 02:15:33,360
They didn't arrest the Boogaloo's.

3204
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:35,920
When they've arrested Antifa, they're released later.

3205
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:36,960
They did their job well.

3206
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,720
They set up America.

3207
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:41,140
Trump knew his supporters were patriotic and non-violent.

3208
02:15:41,140 --> 02:15:42,380
He said be non-violent.

3209
02:15:42,380 --> 02:15:43,380
He didn't incite anything.

3210
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:45,760
They went down there to say, we see the election fraud.

3211
02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:47,280
We have the numbers to show it.

3212
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:48,280
Trump fought back.

3213
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:49,680
He did the right thing.

3214
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:52,340
He didn't roll over.

3215
02:15:52,340 --> 02:15:55,080
He didn't submit.

3216
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:59,840
If you want to keep us on air, go to mfoarstore.com and get t-shirts, books, films, got a bunch

3217

02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:04,160

02:16:08,620 --> 02:16:14,760
They're all there at mfoarstore.com.

3221
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:18,460
But separately, this is new world order.

3222
02:16:18,460 --> 02:16:19,460
This is 2020.

3223
02:16:19,460 --> 02:16:27,400
I remember reading when I was 21 years old, 2020 in congressional record, I was into that

3224
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:28,400
stuff back then.

3225
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:31,240
It was so interesting.

3226
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:33,960
So again, here we are.

3227
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:35,440
Every generation goes through something.

3228
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:37,600
Every third generation goes into something really big.

3229
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:38,840
We're going through it right now.

3230
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:41,280
So I want to thank the crew for their great job.

3231
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:49,720
There is this amazingly important report from a major pop artist exposing chemtrails and

3232
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:50,720
country clubs.

3233
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:51,720
Don't do it.

3234
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:52,720
I hope that you will share.

3235
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:53,720
Don't do it.

3236
02:16:53,720 --> 02:16:54,720
Don't do it.

3237
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:55,720
Don't do it.

3238
02:16:55,720 --> 02:16:56,720
Chemtrails over the country club video.

3239
02:16:56,720 --> 02:16:57,720
Just don't do it.

3240
02:16:57,720 --> 02:16:58,720
It's posted to band.video.

3241
02:16:58,720 --> 02:16:59,720
Here it is.

3242
02:16:59,720 --> 02:17:00,720
That's amazing.

3243
02:17:00,720 --> 02:17:08,480
He introduces Glennon Del Rey's video for chemtrails at the country club as a report.

3244
02:17:08,480 --> 02:17:12,620
That's a very important report, this music video.

3245
02:17:12,620 --> 02:17:17,480
He used a lot of words to say that the Patriot movement is filled with stupid gullible cowards,

3246
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:21,800
but I understand why he tells his version of the story.

3247
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:25,680
It's far more exciting than saying that the Patriot movement is a bunch of stupid gullible

3248
02:17:25,680 --> 02:17:26,680
cowards.

3249
02:17:26,680 --> 02:17:28,520
Well, that's what Pete Santilli would say.

3250
02:17:28,520 --> 02:17:29,520
Yeah.

3251
02:17:29,520 --> 02:17:30,520
Man.

3252
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:35,520
I love, I want to see what the most trivial thing Alex would call an important report

3253
02:17:35,520 --> 02:17:36,520
is.

3254
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:42,560
We are fighting demons who are overthrowing the United States Republic, destroying the

3255
02:17:42,560 --> 02:17:43,720
constitution.

3256
02:17:43,720 --> 02:17:47,960
We need upwards of two amendments now, and I will tell you this right now.

3257
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:50,000
We're going to go out to our special report.

3258
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,000
That's right.

3259
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,260
It is a Looney Tunes cartoon.

3260
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:54,720
Here we go.

3261
02:17:54,720 --> 02:17:59,480
From our new reporter here at Infowars, Lana Del Rey.

3262
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:01,040
Jesus.

3263
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:04,040
God, what a ride.

3264
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:05,800
What is happening?

3265
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:06,800
I don't know.

3266
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:09,680
Are we, are we fake or is he fake?

3267
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:10,800
I can't tell anymore.

3268
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:11,920
I just don't know.

3269
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:12,920
Yeah.

3270
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:13,920
I just don't know.

3271
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:17,480
I don't feel like I learned much from this.

3272
02:18:17,480 --> 02:18:18,720
I learned a lot about history.

3273
02:18:18,720 --> 02:18:19,720
Yeah.

3274
02:18:19,720 --> 02:18:20,720
I learned a lot about World War II, Dan.

3275
02:18:20,720 --> 02:18:21,720
Yeah.

3276
02:18:21,720 --> 02:18:25,320
I mean, I'm glad, I'm glad I got the benefit of his thousands of books.

3277
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:26,320
Totally.

3278
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:32,320
It's nice to see multiple instances of him just reading Wikipedia pages poorly.

3279
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:33,320
Yeah.

3280
02:18:33,320 --> 02:18:34,320
God, this is dumb.

3281
02:18:34,320 --> 02:18:35,360
This show is so dumb.

3282
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:38,240
I'm really excited for Friday, though, because I do think...

3283
02:18:38,240 --> 02:18:39,240
Well, it's his last broadcast.

3284
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:42,160
Well, I mean, can't wait for the second last broadcast.

3285
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:44,160
Can't wait for the second last broadcast.

3286
02:18:44,160 --> 02:18:47,440
But it'll be better than the November 24th, for sure.

3287
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:48,660
Well, I would hope so.

3288
02:18:48,660 --> 02:18:49,660
Can't be worse than that.

3289
02:18:49,660 --> 02:18:50,960
He's had time to think about it.

3290
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:51,960
Yeah.

3291
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:52,960
Yeah.

3292
02:18:52,960 --> 02:18:55,080
And multiple false starts.

3293
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:56,080
Yes.

3294
02:18:56,080 --> 02:18:57,080
Yeah.

3295
02:18:57,080 --> 02:19:00,400
And I just think there will be something interesting on the day of the inauguration.

3296
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:04,000
Like I hope that everything goes smoothly in the world.

3297
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:07,200
You know, we're recording this on Tuesday, it comes out on Wednesday.

3298
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:10,160
I hope it's an uneventful day by and large.

3299
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:13,720
But I also hope that Alex cries or something.

3300
02:19:13,720 --> 02:19:14,720
Sure.

3301
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:16,520
I hope he throws a hatchet or something.

3302
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:17,520
Yeah.

3303
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:19,960
Like, I hope there's something interesting and it's not just mopey Alex.

3304
02:19:19,960 --> 02:19:21,680
Yeah, he's gotta bring something.

3305
02:19:21,680 --> 02:19:24,900
There's potential for, like, some real performance.

3306
02:19:24,900 --> 02:19:27,320
And I hope we see something as opposed to nothing.

3307
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:30,640
But I hope that the something that we see isn't this, like...

3308
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:38,640
That Sunday show, the hard shift into immigrant bashing is really not good.

3309
02:19:38,640 --> 02:19:42,460
I know that that's a normal thing for Alex, but it had been absent for a little while.

3310
02:19:42,460 --> 02:19:44,200
Or at least on the back burner.

3311
02:19:44,200 --> 02:19:46,000
Really don't like to see it coming forward again.

3312
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,000
It's really annoying.

3313
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:55,140
Yeah, the full, let's direct our attention away from all Democrats directly towards minorities

3314
02:19:55,140 --> 02:20:01,600
of any shape, specifically ones that aren't white, is normal.

3315
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:06,240
But it was nice whenever they just wanted to kill us all equally, you know?

3316
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:10,760
There was a feeling of, yeah, I don't know.

3317
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:11,760
Camaraderie?

3318
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:12,760
Yeah, I guess.

3319
02:20:12,760 --> 02:20:13,760
I don't know.

3320
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:16,000
Anyway, Jordan, we will be back.

3321
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,680
But until then, we have a website.

3322
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:18,680
We do have a website.

3323
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:19,680
It's knowledgefight.com.

3324
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:20,680
You bet.

3325
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:21,680
We're on Twitter.

3326
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:22,680
We are on Twitter.

3327
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:23,680
It's at Knowledge Fight and I go to bed Jordan.

3328
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:24,680
We're also on Facebook.

3329
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:29,200
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

3330
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:30,640
doing God's work right now.

3331
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:31,640
We'll be back.

3332
02:20:31,640 --> 02:20:32,640
But until then, I'm Neo.

3333
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:33,640
I'm Leo.

3334
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:34,640
I'm DZXClark.

3335
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:36,760
I'm Daryl Rundis.

3336
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:39,640
I'm telling Mike Adams to grow the fuck up.

3337
02:20:39,640 --> 02:20:40,640
Andy in Kansas.

3338
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:41,640
You're on the air.

3339
02:20:41,640 --> 02:20:42,640
Thanks for holding.

3340
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:43,640
Hello, Alex.

3341
02:20:43,640 --> 02:20:44,640
I'm a first time caller.

3342
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:45,640
I'm a huge fan.

3343
02:20:45,640 --> 02:20:46,640
I love your work.

3344
02:20:46,640 --> 02:20:55,600
I love you.
