N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
knowledgefight.com

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
It's time to pray.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
I have great respect for knowledge fight.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Knowledge fight.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
We are the bad guys. Knowledge Fight.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Dan and Jordan, Knowledge Fight.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
Rattle her, rattle her, rattle her.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
I need, I need money.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Rattle her, rattle her, rattle her.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and,

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Stop it, Andy and, Andy and, Andy and, Andy and, Andy and,

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
It's time to pray.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
I love your work.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Knowledge Fight.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
knowledgefight.com

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
I love you.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm Jordan.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages,

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Oh, indeed we are Dan.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Jordan.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Dan.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Jordan.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
I have a quick question for you.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
What's up?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
What's your bright spot today?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
My bright spot today, Jordan, is, so I mentioned not too long ago,

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
a little while back, Policy Wonk Lisa signed us up for the

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Hot Sauce of the Month Club.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Indeed.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
And I got the second installment of the Hot Sauce of the Month Club.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
I like it.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
And I think, I think it's called FYM Sauce.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Okay.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
I don't know what it stands for.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Fuck your mother.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Or, uh, fuck your mouth, something.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah, I hope it's not that, that's creepier.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Well, I mean, it's, you're putting spicy things in your mouth.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
I understand that, but somehow it's just, unfortunate.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I don't mean, I mean fuck your mouth and like fuck your feelings.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I understand that.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Forget about your mouth.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Well, I mean, you can say that a lot of different ways.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Sure.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Um, it's very challenging, the sauce.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
It's, it, I had some on some chicken nuggets last night.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Would you say it's a real motherfucker?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yes.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Okay.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Yes, it definitely is.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I, I tossed the nuggets in the sauce.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Uh huh.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
And for a good couple hours afterwards, I was sort of like, oh Nelly.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Oh boy.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Oh, sweating from the face a good bit.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Took me for a ride.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
I really enjoyed it.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Although stomach, stomach had some.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
All those, all those noises that you made are, do not denote a joyful ride.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
No, generally not, but I enjoyed it.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
It's a, it was good.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
It was good.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
The first month was really, it was good.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
It was hot, but it was, it wasn't like, it wasn't a trial.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Sure, sure, sure.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Kafka had nothing to do with it.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
This came fast.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
It ramped up really fast and it creeped on you too.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
I see.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Good, good stuff.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
I believe you.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
I'm ready for month three already.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Yes, I believe you.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
What about you?

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
Uh, uh, Dan, my, my bright spot is I, uh, I finally got my equipment worked out.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
I finally got it all set up and I did a little bit of streaming today.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Video games streaming.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
I did a little bit of video games streaming.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Congratulations, over on Twitch.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Played, uh, Final Fantasy 7, the remake.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Awesome.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
My plan is I've decided to riff the, the whole game.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Yeah.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Like MST3K, but for Final Fantasy 7.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
That sounds fun.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
That's my plan.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Very difficult.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I mean, paying attention to playing and trying to talk at the same time.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
It's very hard.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
I think it's a, I think it's an acquired skill too.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
You get better at it as you go along.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah, I enjoyed it.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
It was, uh, it was good times.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Good times.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
Well, I was, I look forward to joining you at some point while you do these video game

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
streams.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Oh, indeed you will.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
And make fun of your terrible play.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I can't wait.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
It'll be great.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Oh, look at you.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
It's, uh, yeah.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Using that materia.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
I, I realize that, uh, just randomly saying I'm going to start at 2 central on a, on a

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
day, but, but it's like I finally got everything worked out so that it would work.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And you know me, I don't do well with like delay.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Oh, we're going to start doing that now.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I was like, now begin it.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I'm releasing my book.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
I don't give a shit.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
And I don't think there's a problem with that.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
You'll work out a schedule eventually.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah, that'll be good.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
And I'm sure some people came in and enjoyed the time.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
So some walks get to hang out.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
That might be a better thing to do for a live stream.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
If anyone in our audience is interested in it, then us live streaming episodes, quite

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
frankly, that might be better because you can be distracted while you're playing a video

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
game.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
It's much more frustrating when I'm distracted trying to host a podcast.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
That's fair.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
That is definitely fair.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Can't, uh, can't quite keep up with the chat.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah, no, that's a, that'd be interesting.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I look forward to it.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
I don't know if I've completely figured out how to set it up so we can all be on there

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
together without the lag screwing everything up.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Uh, but I think I can always just come over to your house too.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
You can just come over to my house.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
That's true.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Yeah.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
We're in a, we're in our COVID bubble.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
That's fair.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
That's fair.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I'm a little bit cramped in my, in my tiny little room.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
That's fine.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Um, so Jordan, today, uh, we got an interesting episode to go over.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
We're back to talking about Alex Jones after Monday's little, uh, salt break, as I've decided

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
to call it.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I don't think that's bad.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Um, so we have to do a little bit of catch up.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
And so what we're doing today is we're going over January 14th to 17th, which is, uh, uh,

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of last week, all within the year 2021.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Blackjack!

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Blackjack, baby!

05:11.000 --> 05:12.320
I want to add a baby to it.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.320
I like it.

05:13.320 --> 05:14.320
I don't know.

05:14.320 --> 05:15.320
I feel like it's forced.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.320
All right.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.320
We'll see.

05:17.320 --> 05:18.320
We'll see.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.080
Um, so what my plan is, is to go over this period of time.

05:21.080 --> 05:27.680
And then for Friday's episode, we will witness the end of Trump's presidency on Alex Jones's

05:27.680 --> 05:28.680
show.

05:28.680 --> 05:29.680
Oh boy.

05:29.680 --> 05:35.000
So that will be, uh, you know, I mean, just the sound of silence.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Yeah.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Hello darkness.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
But for two to three hours, as we listen to one man lose his mind.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
That'll be fun.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.840
Um, so I got, uh, I got an interesting, uh, stretch here.

05:46.840 --> 05:50.120
There's some really, really troubling stuff.

05:50.120 --> 05:51.440
Some really stupid stuff.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.440
Sure.

05:52.440 --> 05:56.480
And Alex realizing that Steve Pachanik has been fucking with him for 20 years.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.480
Finally.

05:57.480 --> 05:58.480
Thank God.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.840
I am looking forward to the moment that I get to hear that happen.

06:01.840 --> 06:03.720
He has a dark moment of clarity on Saturday.

06:03.720 --> 06:04.720
I love it.

06:04.720 --> 06:05.720
Give it to me.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.480
I'm not going to go into business on all of this, but first Jordan, we're going to take

06:07.480 --> 06:09.840
a moment to say thank you to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show.

06:09.840 --> 06:10.840
Oh, that's a great idea.

06:10.840 --> 06:13.160
So first Rory loves a low low.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.160
But she goes by low low.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.160
Oh, I like low low.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.160
I like low low.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.160
Yeah.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.160
It's a good name.

Thank you very much.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.160
THC.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.160
Why is everybody doing it in acronyms?

06:52.160 --> 06:54.920
They requested that I say it really ominously.

06:54.920 --> 06:56.640
So I did my best ominous reading there.

06:56.640 --> 06:57.640
You did great.

06:57.640 --> 06:58.640
Thank you.

06:58.640 --> 06:59.640

Then finally I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on Elevated

Love and appreciate that very much.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.600
Thank you so much.

07:22.600 --> 07:23.600
You are now a technocrat.

07:23.600 --> 07:24.600
I'm a policy wonk.

07:24.600 --> 07:25.600
Crikey mate.

07:25.600 --> 07:26.600
That's fantastic.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.600
Have yourself a brew.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.600
How's your 401k doing bro?

07:29.600 --> 07:31.920
We gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson alright?

07:31.920 --> 07:33.480
Let's just get down to business.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.560
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.480
Why you pimps so good?

07:37.480 --> 07:39.120
My neck is freakishly large.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.600
I declare info war on you.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.800
Thank you so much Andy B. up in Minnesota.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.740
Thank you so much to Ghost Panda of Coal Creek.

07:46.740 --> 07:48.240
Thank you very much to the both of you.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.240
Yeah!

07:49.240 --> 07:50.240
Is Coal Creek in Minnesota?

07:50.240 --> 07:51.240
Uh I don't know but it is.

07:51.240 --> 07:52.240
I think Minnesota has a Coal Creek.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.240
Minneapolis, Minnesota and Coal Creek.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.240
We got a lot of Minnesotans.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.040
We got a whole, yeah yeah yeah.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.760
All the Canucks that are slightly lower.

07:59.760 --> 08:00.760
Sure.

08:00.760 --> 08:01.760
That's what I'm gonna call them.

08:01.760 --> 08:02.760
Sure.

08:02.760 --> 08:08.040
All I can, the only reference I've got is I guess Prince and Ryan Sayers.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.040
Alright.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.040
Okay.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.040
That's all I got.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.040
Musical references.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.040
I like it.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.000
I think I've been to Minneapolis.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.040
You think you have?

08:17.040 --> 08:18.040
I have.

08:18.040 --> 08:22.360
There are so many cities in the US that I think I've been to but I'm not positive.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.480
I got kicked out of a billionaire's house in Minneapolis.

08:24.480 --> 08:25.480
Really?

08:25.480 --> 08:26.480
Yeah yeah yeah.

08:26.480 --> 08:27.480
What happened?

08:27.480 --> 08:30.280
I used to work for, I used to sell hearing aids and the like.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.280
Okay.

08:31.280 --> 08:35.720
And one of the owners of the biggest hearing aid cartel in the world is stationed out of

08:35.720 --> 08:36.720
Minneapolis.

08:36.720 --> 08:37.720
Was it Prince?

08:37.720 --> 08:38.720
Uh no.

08:38.720 --> 08:39.720
Oh.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.720
It's a guy named Rogers Nelson.

08:40.720 --> 08:41.720
Something.

08:41.720 --> 08:46.320
But the company's name is Starkey and we got invited there because my cousin has his whole

08:46.320 --> 08:50.360
thing and we got invited to his house as like a reward for people who sold some number of

08:50.360 --> 08:53.760
hearing aids and he and I got way too drunk and we were asked to leave.

08:53.760 --> 08:54.760
Oh wow.

08:54.760 --> 08:55.760
So it was nice.

08:55.760 --> 08:56.760
It's an experience.

08:56.760 --> 08:57.760
Yeah.

08:57.760 --> 08:58.760
I peed on his floor.

08:58.760 --> 08:59.760
I'm proud of myself.

08:59.760 --> 09:00.760
Jeez.

09:00.760 --> 09:01.760
Alright.

09:01.760 --> 09:02.760
Were you proud of yourself the next morning?

09:02.760 --> 09:03.760
Yes.

09:03.760 --> 09:04.760
Fuck that guy.

09:04.760 --> 09:05.760
Oh wow.

09:05.760 --> 09:06.760
Okay.

09:06.760 --> 09:07.760
You and I are different.

09:07.760 --> 09:11.880
Also I mean at the same time my boss at the time was my cousin so I had a little bit more

09:11.880 --> 09:12.880
of a.

09:12.880 --> 09:13.880
Little wiggle room.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.600
I can be on the floor of a billionaire's home.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.600
Yeah.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.600
You know.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.600
Yeah.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.600
So Jordan we're gonna start here on the 14th.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.600
Let's do it.

09:20.600 --> 09:21.600
We got some bad news to start things off.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.600
Alright.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.040
The left is on a rampage.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.040
Sure.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.600
I've been here since very early this morning.

09:26.600 --> 09:33.000
I've been doing a lot of research and then we had the FBI contact us just about 30 minutes

09:33.000 --> 09:38.280
ago and then I found out why Roger Stone is in hiding.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.180
It was worse than we thought.

09:40.180 --> 09:44.260
Somebody came to his house and then waited for his wife who was handicapped and hearing

09:44.260 --> 09:46.600
impaired and beat her up.

09:46.600 --> 09:50.640
So she's been in the hospital and they also sent somebody to Laura Loomer's house to try

09:50.640 --> 09:55.480
to kidnap her and so this is the Bolshevik takeover.

09:55.480 --> 09:57.160
You just need to understand that.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.000
You need to know that.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.640
And they are actively trying to say that we masterminded the attack at the Capitol with

10:03.640 --> 10:05.160
the U.S. military.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.360
So that's the line they're going with now.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.360
Haha.

10:08.360 --> 10:09.360
Unbelievable.

10:09.360 --> 10:13.960
On the 14th news that Roger Stone's wife was attacked by a leftist activist went huge all

10:13.960 --> 10:15.760
over the conservative media.

10:15.760 --> 10:20.360
Blogs ran unconfirmed articles about how they were targeted for political violence and commentators

10:20.360 --> 10:23.640
opined about how the mainstream media was covering it up.

10:23.640 --> 10:27.160
Then on the 15th there was an article in the Floridian Press that sought to clear things

10:27.160 --> 10:28.360
up a little bit.

10:28.360 --> 10:32.440
They reached out to Roger and reported quote we learned that media outlets today began

10:32.440 --> 10:36.480
to fudge the facts of the incident and as the story was recycled around the truth of

10:36.480 --> 10:37.960
what happened was distorted.

10:37.960 --> 10:38.960
Here we go.

10:38.960 --> 10:42.760
Here's the statement they published from Roger about the truth of the incident.

10:42.760 --> 10:48.420
Quote on December 23rd my wife Nydia and my Yorkie Mimi were attacked by a pit bull.

10:48.420 --> 10:53.480
Our beloved dog was badly injured requiring two surgeries and Nydia was bitten badly when

10:53.480 --> 10:56.480
she attempted to get between the pit bull and our baby.

10:56.480 --> 11:00.920
This incident was reported to both Fort Lauderdale police and Broward County Animal Control.

11:00.920 --> 11:04.520
Nydia sustained substantial injuries in the pit bull attack.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.760
Last week there was an incident in front of our home when we returned from dinner.

11:07.760 --> 11:11.840
A man on a bicycle recognized me and started screaming numerous political epithets which

11:11.840 --> 11:14.240
are not fit for a family newspaper.

11:14.240 --> 11:18.480
While there was a scuffle Mrs. Stone sustained no new injuries in the event.

11:18.480 --> 11:21.800
Reports that she was badly beaten or hospitalized are incorrect.

11:21.800 --> 11:25.840
This event was also accurately reported to the Fort Lauderdale police.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.440
Seems like Alex is kind of embellishing the story a little bit.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.440
Poor dog.

11:29.440 --> 11:33.000
He probably should have reached out to Roger for a comment considering how close the two

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
of them are.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.440
Not answering his phone calls.

11:35.440 --> 11:38.820
I'm sure Roger would have been happy to clear things up so Alex wouldn't have to report

11:38.820 --> 11:42.000
a completely false story about Roger's wife on air.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Not interested.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.880
Seems fucking disrespectful as hell.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.220
In answering Alex's phone calls.

11:47.220 --> 11:49.760
So I would say this is not good.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.780
And as for the story about Laura Loomer I'm gonna need to see some evidence before I even

11:52.780 --> 11:55.160
start caring about whatever's going on there.

11:55.160 --> 11:59.440
Anything that's reported about her on Infowars is an attempt at a publicity stunt until proven

11:59.440 --> 12:00.440
otherwise.

12:00.440 --> 12:05.000
Yeah all I can think is that Roger himself is on a rampage and has been dressing up like

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
a pit bull.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.880
That's the only thing that makes sense to me.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.480
He's attacking people left and right dressed up like a pit bull.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.320
His day drinking has evolved.

12:14.320 --> 12:21.120
So now we get to the new framing of the storming of the Capitol back on January 6th.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.320
Alex has some historical parallels.

12:23.320 --> 12:31.160
I feel like we're on the fifth new framing of an event that doesn't need any new framing.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.760
We're gonna get a couple ones on this episode.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.040
We're gonna get a couple framings.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.040
This is frustrating.

12:35.040 --> 12:36.040
And one new patsy.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.040
Okay good.

12:37.040 --> 12:44.320
The headline of Infowars.com is confirmed January 6th capital attack was Reichstag 2.0.

12:44.320 --> 12:51.440
If you don't know about the Reichstag attack we're gonna be covering that when we come

12:51.440 --> 12:58.960
back because right in that printer snuggled in that warm printer is the little printout

12:58.960 --> 13:04.120
where I'm gonna read you about what happened in the Reichstag attack.

13:04.120 --> 13:05.420
But that's what this is.

13:05.420 --> 13:09.640
This is a Reichstag attack that happened right when Hitler got elected.

13:09.640 --> 13:10.640
He was very unpopular.

13:10.640 --> 13:14.800
They thought he'd stolen the election and he firebombed that bitch.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.000
So this isn't good.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.920
I like the idea that something's getting printed out.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.600
I'm excited to find out what that's gonna be.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.600
Wow they gotta print it out.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.960
It's got the little hooks on the edge.

13:23.960 --> 13:27.560
They gotta perforate the thing and tear it apart.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.560
Yeah.

13:28.560 --> 13:32.720
So Alex has a couple of details wrong about the Reichstag fire here.

13:32.720 --> 13:33.720
Sure.

13:33.720 --> 13:34.720
That's surprising.

13:34.720 --> 13:37.600
The most important element he's completely making up is that the fire happened after

13:37.600 --> 13:40.560
Hitler won an election that people thought was fraudulent.

13:40.560 --> 13:41.560
That's nonsense.

13:41.560 --> 13:45.080
Alex is saying this because he knows that his audience is gullible and if he paints

13:45.080 --> 13:49.040
a one-to-one comparison of Hitler and Biden it stands to scare them more and drive more

13:49.040 --> 13:50.880
profits to info wars.

13:50.880 --> 13:55.440
In reality the Reichstag fire occurred on February 27th, 1933.

13:55.440 --> 14:00.000
In January of that year Hitler had been appointed Chancellor of Germany's government which was

14:00.000 --> 14:03.640
still under the control of the country's president Paul von Hindenburg.

14:03.640 --> 14:07.040
The structure of the government was that the president was the elected leader of the country

14:07.040 --> 14:10.740
who would then appoint a chancellor who would be responsible for introducing legislation

14:10.740 --> 14:14.040
to members of the Reichstag who were also elected officials.

14:14.040 --> 14:19.680
At any point the president could dismiss his chancellor, you know, that he had control

14:19.680 --> 14:20.920
over that position.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.680
Or so he thought.

14:22.680 --> 14:27.720
Well, according to the Smithsonian Magazine, quote, Hindenburg reluctantly appointed Hitler

14:27.720 --> 14:33.120
as chancellor on the advice of Franz von Papen, a disgruntled former chancellor who believed

14:33.120 --> 14:37.400
the conservative bourgeois parties should ally with the Nazis to keep the communists

14:37.400 --> 14:38.400
out of party.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.800
Man, I have heard something like that so frequently in the past.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.240
Fear of communism leads to aligning with fascists every time.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.860
It does seem like it happens every time.

14:46.860 --> 14:50.480
The reality of the Reichstag fire is that it was an event almost certainly committed

14:50.480 --> 14:53.020
by the Nazis which they blamed on communists.

14:53.020 --> 14:56.620
This allowed Hitler to use the event as a rallying cry against the communists and as

14:56.620 --> 15:00.400
a justification for why the government needed to assert dictatorship level powers to crush

15:00.400 --> 15:01.400
the threat they posed.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.400
Sure.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.920
There's no better way to put this than this.

15:03.920 --> 15:07.840
What Alex is doing right now is attempting the same political maneuvering that the Nazis

15:07.840 --> 15:09.240
engaged in in 1933.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.240
Yes, correct.

15:10.240 --> 15:13.840
There was a terrible event that drove home the sobering reality to a large portion of

15:13.840 --> 15:17.440
the country, and that terrible event can be incredibly useful if you can blame it on your

15:17.440 --> 15:18.680
enemies.

15:18.680 --> 15:22.960
This is why Alex is now on air fudging details about the Reichstag fire.

15:22.960 --> 15:27.960
And if you did it, it is wise to blame it on your enemies, otherwise people will think

15:27.960 --> 15:29.320
it's your fault.

15:29.320 --> 15:30.320
True.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.320
Yeah.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.240
It's definitely true of the present situation.

15:33.240 --> 15:34.240
Yeah.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.240
You don't want people to think it's your fault.

15:35.240 --> 15:36.240
No.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.240
No.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.760
So Alex really has a bad handle on history.

15:39.760 --> 15:40.760
Oh yeah.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.760
I've heard him, I mean, like, you know, the fake quotes are one thing.

15:43.760 --> 15:44.760
Sure.

15:44.760 --> 15:48.520
But like, man, he's way out of line here.

15:48.520 --> 16:04.520
February 27th, 1933, from the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.

16:04.520 --> 16:05.520
That was the date.

16:05.520 --> 16:06.520
February 27th, 1933.

16:06.520 --> 16:13.480
Adolf A. Lewis Hitler had narrowly won the presidency of Germany, but von Hindenburg

16:13.480 --> 16:17.320
was not stepping down as the chancellor.

16:17.320 --> 16:21.320
The most powerful position in the Weimar Republic.

16:21.320 --> 16:24.000
This is crazy not true.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Yeah.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.460
Hitler had not won an election for the presidency of Germany.

16:27.460 --> 16:32.160
He was chancellor beginning in 1933, at which point he began maneuvering to seize more and

16:32.160 --> 16:36.340
more power for himself in the Nazi party, who had had a great showing in the Reichstag

16:36.340 --> 16:39.280
elections in the 1932 election.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.280
People like Nazis.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.280
Yeah.

16:41.280 --> 16:44.760
Hindenburg died in 1934, at which point Hitler dissolved the office of the presidency and

16:44.760 --> 16:48.960
combined its powers with that of the chancellor, essentially making himself both chancellor

16:48.960 --> 16:49.960
and president.

16:49.960 --> 16:54.800
In the 1932 election, Hindenburg had soundly defeated Hitler, but the Nazi party itself,

16:54.800 --> 16:57.000
like I said, had gained a large number of seats.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.960
The scenario that Alex is painting is 100 percent revisionist history, because he needs

17:00.960 --> 17:04.520
his audience to think that they're living through a direct parallel to Hitler's rise

17:04.520 --> 17:05.520
to power.

17:05.520 --> 17:10.040
Paul von Hindenburg wasn't chancellor, and there was not a contested election for president

17:10.040 --> 17:12.120
in the way that Alex is describing.

17:12.120 --> 17:16.200
This is just an idiot making stuff up because he knows his audience doesn't know any better

17:16.200 --> 17:18.120
and won't bother to look into it.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.680
Does not care either way.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.680
Yeah.

17:20.680 --> 17:23.200
This is one of the things I'd really like to drive home to anyone who may have some

17:23.200 --> 17:27.360
inclination to take Alex Jones seriously or think he knows what he's talking about.

17:27.360 --> 17:32.720
If he has this little a grasp of basic facts, like who was in what office when the Reichstag

17:32.720 --> 17:37.620
happened, and he's so willing to confidently assert really fundamental inaccuracies, why

17:37.620 --> 17:41.280
would you ever give him the benefit of the doubt with more complicated stuff?

17:41.280 --> 17:45.960
If he can't be bothered to understand really simple arithmetic, you shouldn't listen to

17:45.960 --> 17:49.840
him about geometry or algebra or trigonometry.

17:49.840 --> 17:50.840
He doesn't know how to add.

17:50.840 --> 17:53.540
No, no, no, absolutely not.

17:53.540 --> 17:57.520
He doesn't have a basic grasp of the fundamentals of existence.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.120
He doesn't know grammar.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.960
Don't let him tell you how to edit your paper or whatever.

18:01.960 --> 18:06.620
I don't know what the metaphor would be, but if you don't know the building blocks upon

18:06.620 --> 18:12.160
which understanding can be built, you- Right.

18:12.160 --> 18:16.560
I feel like one of the fundamental things that he doesn't get is that some things are

18:16.560 --> 18:19.400
and some things are not.

18:19.400 --> 18:23.960
Everything seems to be fungible there, but some things have to be and some things have

18:23.960 --> 18:24.960
to not be.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.240
And the things- They cannot just be whatever you want them

18:27.240 --> 18:28.240
to be.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.240
Right.

18:29.240 --> 18:32.880
And if he wants me to take it all seriously, the idea that he knows this secret information

18:32.880 --> 18:37.800
that Hitler was set up or all this nonsense that he throws around all the time, this revisionist

18:37.800 --> 18:42.920
World War II history, and he doesn't know who was in what office, that's embarrassing,

18:42.920 --> 18:43.920
man.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.360
You can't do this.

18:45.360 --> 18:50.440
You know what is blowing my mind, and it's just going to be so painful.

18:50.440 --> 18:56.180
It's going to be so painful, Dan, if you recall, oh, those early days in 2017, whenever you

18:56.180 --> 19:02.360
would call Trump a Nazi, and people would go, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't just throw

19:02.360 --> 19:03.980
that word around.

19:03.980 --> 19:05.280
That's a terrible thing to do.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.360
It needs to be used correctly.

19:07.360 --> 19:12.720
And now we are about to begin a long stretch of literally everything Biden does-

19:12.720 --> 19:13.720
Nazi.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.720
Making him a Nazi.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.720
Yep.

19:15.720 --> 19:20.860
That will be screamed at us from all corners of the world, including the ones who screamed

19:20.860 --> 19:22.400
at us to not call Trump a Nazi.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.720
I would say almost exclusively from those corners.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.320
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:26.320 --> 19:30.840
But if they come from Alex, one of the good things you can always fall back on is he knows

19:30.840 --> 19:33.320
literally nothing about World War II history.

19:33.320 --> 19:34.320
That's fair.

19:34.320 --> 19:41.160
But days after the election that Hitler won by a very slight margin, fire bombs hit the

19:41.160 --> 19:46.720
Capitol and was blamed on his enemies, the communists.

19:46.720 --> 19:50.040
At least he's not pretending it wasn't the communists who got blamed.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.040
Yeah, that's nice.

19:51.040 --> 19:55.140
Yeah, it's almost like he's trying real hard to thread the line where he's like, the Nazis

19:55.140 --> 19:56.280
were the good guys here.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.280
Oh, so what's he saying?

19:57.280 --> 19:58.840
The election days, what is he saying?

19:58.840 --> 20:04.480
The election prior to the Reichstag fire was in April 1932, about a year prior to the fire.

20:04.480 --> 20:09.000
360, 330 days prior after the, yeah.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.600
There was an election for Reichstag members scheduled for six days after the fire, but

20:12.600 --> 20:15.360
that's the opposite of what Alex is describing.

20:15.360 --> 20:18.800
Alex either knows nothing about World War II history and is pretending he does in order

20:18.800 --> 20:23.640
to scare his audience, or he does know what the reality is and he's willfully lying to

20:23.640 --> 20:27.400
them in order to make it more closely match this scenario also to scare them.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.400
You betcha.

20:28.400 --> 20:29.720
You really should stop.

20:29.720 --> 20:30.720
This is pretty bad.

20:30.720 --> 20:31.720
It's bad.

20:31.720 --> 20:32.720
It's real bad.

20:32.720 --> 20:33.720
Congratulations though, Alex.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.440
You have a real depth of, remember when you said you read a hundred books on World War

20:36.440 --> 20:37.440
II?

20:37.440 --> 20:38.440
A thousand books on World War II?

20:38.440 --> 20:45.440
Are there any Nazis in the United States willing to sue on behalf of the Nazi party for Alex's

20:45.440 --> 20:47.720
bad portrayal of them?

20:47.720 --> 20:48.960
I mean, it's just-

20:48.960 --> 20:49.960
Slander, sir.

20:49.960 --> 20:50.960
Yeah.

20:50.960 --> 20:51.960
Slander.

20:51.960 --> 20:57.520
I mean, there's things that are interpretation and there are things that are like, what was,

20:57.520 --> 20:59.400
who was where?

20:59.400 --> 21:00.400
What power alignment-

21:00.400 --> 21:02.480
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.920
Some things are and some things are not.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.200
You can't just say that that's how-

21:07.200 --> 21:09.160
It's staggering to me.

21:09.160 --> 21:13.680
It's embarrassing for Alex and he never has to pay any consequences, even in terms of

21:13.680 --> 21:17.040
embarrassment for not knowing any of this shit.

21:17.040 --> 21:21.320
Yeah, and the people who believe him are so, so sad.

21:21.320 --> 21:25.600
So Alex mentioned earlier that the FBI called him.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.040
Yeah, we might learn a little bit more about that.

21:28.040 --> 21:31.840
Man, wow, I've hit Twilight Zone, Twilight Zone.

21:31.840 --> 21:36.120
Like in the world of Twilight Zone, for something to be even weirder, like imagine what people

21:36.120 --> 21:39.720
in Twilight Zone, when they watch the Twilight Zone, it must be even weirder or like in the

21:39.720 --> 21:45.040
Twilight Zone of the Twilight Zone.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.040
That's just regular-

21:46.040 --> 21:47.040
Yeah, we'd like you to come in and talk about-

21:47.040 --> 21:48.040
It's a double negative.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.340
You don't know math, man.

21:49.340 --> 21:53.840
Your people in the military have quite distinguished records that work there and you notice this

21:53.840 --> 21:58.400
and that, yeah, we want you to know about what you know about what happened in there.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.400
Wow.

21:59.400 --> 22:02.520
Wow, ladies and gentlemen.

22:02.520 --> 22:06.280
I'm guessing that, first of all, you're right, the Twilight Zone and the Twilight Zone would

22:06.280 --> 22:07.280
be just normal life.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.280
Yeah, normal.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.280
I would assume.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.280
They cancel each other out.

22:10.280 --> 22:11.280
It's a regular zone.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.800
Yeah, and no one ends up getting a harsh lesson about anything.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.480
That would be the version of the show they watch in the Twilight Zone.

22:16.480 --> 22:17.480
No, in the regular-

22:17.480 --> 22:19.120
There's no poetic consequences for things.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.120
Yeah, exactly.

22:20.120 --> 22:21.120
It's just random like everything else.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.120
Yeah.

22:22.120 --> 22:23.120
Yeah.

22:23.120 --> 22:26.880
Well, I was talking about the FBI contacting him and I think I might know why that is.

22:26.880 --> 22:30.240
You remember that he said he had an employee who was there and got footage of the woman

22:30.240 --> 22:31.680
getting shot inside the Capitol?

22:31.680 --> 22:32.680
Maybe.

22:32.680 --> 22:36.320
Well, that means he had an employee who was illegally entering the Capitol.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.680
That sounds like something the FBI would look into.

22:38.680 --> 22:42.480
Alex's employee, Sam, released his raw footage of entering the Capitol building.

22:42.480 --> 22:46.040
I'm just going to play you the minutes where he actually walked through the doors of the

22:46.040 --> 22:50.780
building, thereby committing a crime, and see if you can see any reason why law enforcement

22:50.780 --> 22:52.200
might be interested in talking to Alex.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.200
Okay, I think that's a good idea.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.200
Come on.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.200
Mic down for this.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.200
All right.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.200
We have had enough.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.200
We're not going to take your fucking vaccines.

22:58.200 --> 23:02.200
We're not going to take all your bullshit.

23:02.200 --> 23:05.200
The people are rising up.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.200
To be clear, that voice is the cameraman.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.200
Welcome home.

23:10.200 --> 23:14.200
Folks, I am now on the steps of the Capitol.

23:14.200 --> 23:15.200
Here we go.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.200
Here we go.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.200
Having a good time.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.200
Having a good time.

23:18.200 --> 23:19.200
Everybody's having a good time.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.200
Look at this.

23:20.200 --> 23:25.200
I don't think it costs them what to do.

23:25.200 --> 23:28.200
This is the first time they've seen a peaceful protest succeed.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.200
They're dumbfounded.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.200
They're dumbfounded.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.200
Here they are.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.200
Here they are.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.200
All right.

23:35.200 --> 23:43.200
Folks, I don't know how I made it out of there without getting hurt, but your boy ain't hurt.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.200
But I got to be honest.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.200
This is not a peaceful protest.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.200
This is not a peaceful protest.

23:50.200 --> 23:54.200
So I just want to be accurate about that.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.200
But for whatever that means, you heard it.

23:56.200 --> 24:01.200
As I was going along, I tried to ask a few people what that's going through their mind or what they're feeling.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.200
I don't know what to say.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.200
But they've had enough.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.200
You heard that last gentleman?

24:06.200 --> 24:09.200
He feels like this is the people's house.

24:09.200 --> 24:12.200
And so the people want to take it back.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.200
See?

24:13.200 --> 24:15.200
So here we go.

24:15.200 --> 24:19.200
We got SWAT gear over there.

24:19.200 --> 24:23.200
Everybody in.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.200
Keep the line moving.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.200
Keep the line moving.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.200
All right.

24:29.200 --> 24:32.200
This is your boy Sam with Infowars.com.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.200
Support the war.

24:33.200 --> 24:36.200
Infowarsstore.com.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.200
We got sales to go.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.200
We got sales for days.

24:39.200 --> 24:48.200
Please, it's because of your support that we're able to get into things like this and show you the real news that the media won't.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.200
That they will spin tomorrow.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.200
They're going to spin it.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.200
But guess what?

24:53.200 --> 24:54.200
Guess what?

24:54.200 --> 25:03.200
We are in the Capitol, baby!

25:03.200 --> 25:08.200
He's doing a plug as he enters the Capitol.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.200
I just don't.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.200
These people need to be babysat.

25:12.200 --> 25:21.200
I don't even know if they need to be punished or if they need to be babysat because they clearly have no ability to process reality.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.200
Like none.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.200
It's amazing.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.200
Just none.

25:24.200 --> 25:34.200
You walked into the Capitol building doing an ad for the thing that you're not supposed to be doing.

25:34.200 --> 25:39.200
I'm going to add that to my quickly growing collection of things that really don't look good in hindsight.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.200
This is not a peaceful protest.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.200
This is not a peaceful protest.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.200
Infowars.com.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.200
Infowars.com.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.200
We're in the Capitol, baby.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.200
Oh, man.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.200
You can't really be doing this.

25:50.200 --> 25:58.200
I got to assume that there's a lot of people who have been arrested for breaching the Capitol.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.200
Even people who were just recording, people who didn't break anything.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.200
It's still illegal entry.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.200
That is true.

26:03.200 --> 26:06.200
I don't see why Sam wouldn't be arrested.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.200
Oh, well, you can't arrest him.

26:08.200 --> 26:14.200
He works for Infowars, the tip of the spear, and the FBI is afraid of pissing off Alex.

26:14.200 --> 26:19.200
I would also assume that should Sam be arrested, there might be some interesting questions about,

26:19.200 --> 26:20.200
Oh, you work at Infowars.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.200
Why did you record going in?

26:23.200 --> 26:25.200
Did Alex send you there on an assignment?

26:25.200 --> 26:34.200
Well, I can only say it's with your support that Infowars continues storming the Capitol.

26:34.200 --> 26:40.200
Certainly it does imply that little clip of video tends to indicate that he was there in an official capacity.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.200
It would suggest that, yes.

26:42.200 --> 26:48.200
As part of his duties while promoting Infowarsstore.com, he committed a crime.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.200
Yeah. Yes.

26:49.200 --> 26:52.200
That might be something that people would want to talk to Alex about.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.200
I don't know.

26:53.200 --> 26:56.200
We're in the looking glass here, Dan, we're in the twilight zone of the twilight zone.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.200
Sure.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.200
Yeah.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.200
Everything's normal.

26:59.200 --> 27:04.200
So anyway, Roger's wife's going through some things.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.200
Sure.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.200
This is the real world.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.200
You cannot make this up.

27:07.200 --> 27:14.200
And Roger Stone, a man ran over his wife.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.200
Jesus.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.200
And she got back up and he knocked her over again.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.200
And she has major, and then he knocked her over again.

27:20.200 --> 27:24.200
And so Roger now is going into hiding.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.200
This isn't a joke.

27:26.200 --> 27:37.200
His wife is in the hospital to have emergency surgery because a man beat his wife up.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.200
Just randomly in their little condo area.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.200
Nobody's around.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.200
Randomly.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.200
She's walking the dog.

27:42.200 --> 27:43.200
A dude pulls up on a bike and starts knocking him over.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.200
She gets up.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.200
He knocks her over repeatedly.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.200
That's the left for you folks.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.200
If I were Roger, I'd be pissed about this.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.200
Yeah.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.200
I'd be really not happy about Alex's behavior.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.200
Yeah.

27:53.200 --> 27:57.200
Don't fucking embellish stories about my wife in order to make people scared of the left.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.200
Jesus.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.200
You dick.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.200
I know that's the job.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.200
Come on.

28:02.200 --> 28:08.200
I'm not saying that I hope someone screamed cut his dick off at Roger Stone, but I'm not

28:08.200 --> 28:09.200
not saying it did.

28:09.200 --> 28:12.200
So if I were Roger, I'd be mad about that.

28:12.200 --> 28:13.200
Yeah.

28:13.200 --> 28:14.200
But I'd also not be thrilled about this.

28:14.200 --> 28:18.200
That's where we are right now is beating up a 75-year-old or whatever she is.

28:18.200 --> 28:19.200
She's older than Roger.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.200
Look how old his wife is.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.200
Still looks great for 77 years.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.200
Oh, my God.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.200
His daughter's not bad looking either.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.200
I mean, I mean, that's like God made beautiful women.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.200
I'm not hitting on them.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.200
I'm married.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.200
I'm saying nice ladies.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.200
Wow.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.200
What are we doing?

28:31.200 --> 28:32.200
What do we got?

28:32.200 --> 28:33.200
Do we got to do that?

28:33.200 --> 28:36.200
We don't have to do these things, Alex.

28:36.200 --> 28:39.200
We don't have to say his daughter's hot.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.200
We don't.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.200
Well, I mean, it's it's an interesting way.

28:42.200 --> 28:45.200
He was trying to recover from saying that Roger's wife was hot.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.200
Like, oh, I'll save this by saying his daughter's hot.

28:47.200 --> 28:48.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:48.200 --> 28:50.200
Let me objectify his child instead.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.200
That'll make it better.

28:51.200 --> 28:54.200
Ah, what a good save, everybody.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.200
Why isn't everybody reaching up for high fives?

28:56.200 --> 28:58.200
I got high fives going on.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.200
Where's everybody else's high fives?

29:00.200 --> 29:04.200
So we get back now to the Reichtag fire.

29:04.200 --> 29:09.200
And I was so glad that this paid off because I was worried that that stuff that he was

29:09.200 --> 29:13.200
printing out wasn't, you know, it was going to be the opposite of Chekhov's printer

29:13.200 --> 29:18.200
paper, but we do find out what he had an intern print out for him.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.200
This is Reichstag 2.0.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.200
Reichstag fire.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.200
The Reichstag fire German.

29:23.200 --> 29:29.200
Fire was a arson attack on the Reichstag government building, the capital.

29:29.200 --> 29:35.200
Home of the German parliament in Berlin on Monday, the 27th February, 1933.

29:35.200 --> 29:39.200
Precisely four weeks after Adolf Hitler was sworn in as chancellor of Germany.

29:39.200 --> 29:45.200
Hitler's government stated that it goes on, Marinus van der Lib and all the rest of it.

29:45.200 --> 29:49.200
So this is the Wikipedia article about the Reichstag fire.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.200
Great, great.

29:50.200 --> 29:54.200
If you ever want to tell yourself that Alex does any work, please call this image into your mind.

29:54.200 --> 29:55.200
Great.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.200
He doesn't do shit.

29:56.200 --> 30:01.200
He has his interns print Wikipedia pages for him to fumble his way through blindly reading.

30:01.200 --> 30:06.200
When he said German of fire, that's because on the Wikipedia entry, they include the German

30:06.200 --> 30:09.200
word for the fire, which confused Alex while he was cold reading.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.200
There we go.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.200
This is pathetic.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.200
Wow.

30:12.200 --> 30:15.200
Anyway, more revisionist history about Hitler coming up.

30:15.200 --> 30:20.200
You know, it's one of those things where by having papers, you assume a legitimacy that

30:20.200 --> 30:23.200
somebody ostensibly from the internet doesn't have.

30:23.200 --> 30:29.200
Something about having physical papers suggests, look, we at least did the work, and then you

30:29.200 --> 30:33.200
find out they just printed out the internet, and that's ten times less interesting.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.200
And it's Wikipedia.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.200
And it's Wikipedia.

30:35.200 --> 30:40.200
Yeah, I mean like it's the newsmen of days of yore might have desk papers that they're

30:40.200 --> 30:45.200
looking at, or like you might, you know, I don't know, maybe I've only seen this in sitcoms,

30:45.200 --> 30:48.200
but like somebody comes running in with a piece of paper.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.200
Oh yeah, breaking news, sir.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.200
Yeah, breaking news.

30:50.200 --> 30:54.200
Yeah, typed up, there's transcriptions because you couldn't even do shit like that.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.200
You just had to read it out loud like a man.

30:56.200 --> 30:57.200
Yeah.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.200
Yeah.

30:58.200 --> 31:01.200
And I think Alex is trying to emulate that to give himself some kind of like the appearance

31:01.200 --> 31:03.200
of that, and it's just Wikipedia articles.

31:03.200 --> 31:04.200
Not good.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.200
All right, here's more bullshit.

31:06.200 --> 31:10.200
Hitler first only got elected president, it wasn't enough, and then there was people were

31:10.200 --> 31:16.200
fighting over him trying to become the Fuhrer, and have the former head of the Weimar Republic

31:16.200 --> 31:22.200
step down, and so they had to stage this event that came out in the Nuremberg Trials.

31:22.200 --> 31:25.200
Hitler was not elected president prior to the Reichstag fire.

31:25.200 --> 31:28.200
He'd been appointed chancellor by Hindenburg.

31:28.200 --> 31:31.200
The title Fuhrer didn't really even exist at the time, and I guess he was the Fuhrer

31:31.200 --> 31:36.200
of the Nazi party, but it wouldn't come into being like a state role until after Hindenburg's

31:36.200 --> 31:40.200
death, when Hitler combined the offices of president and chancellor into a new title,

31:40.200 --> 31:44.200
Fuhrer and Reichschansler, which eventually got shortened to Fuhrer.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.200
And then they got shortened to senate majority leader.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.200
Yeah.

31:47.200 --> 31:50.200
I hate to sound like a broken record here, but Alex is just making shit up about Nazi

31:50.200 --> 31:54.200
history for his own benefit here, and then pretending that the Nuremberg Trials back

31:54.200 --> 31:55.200
him up.

31:55.200 --> 32:02.200
The thing that I think is most transparent as an aspect is that Alex knows damn well

32:02.200 --> 32:05.200
in that moment, he's making this up.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.200
He knows he's making this up.

32:07.200 --> 32:11.200
That's why his citation is something like the Nuremberg Trials, which is absolutely

32:11.200 --> 32:12.200
useless as a reference.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.200
So general.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.200
What part of the trial?

32:15.200 --> 32:17.200
How many months long?

32:17.200 --> 32:19.200
Years long?

32:19.200 --> 32:21.200
What exactly came out in those trials even?

32:21.200 --> 32:22.200
He's not even saying.

32:22.200 --> 32:26.200
It's in the white papers, but the trial papers.

32:26.200 --> 32:30.200
When you try to pull the thread there to determine how reliable a source he's being, you have

32:30.200 --> 32:34.200
nowhere solid to go other than thousands of pages of testimony, and you're not even

32:34.200 --> 32:38.200
really sure what you're looking for to prove Alex right or wrong.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.200
That's a big part of Alex's game.

32:40.200 --> 32:44.200
One of his favorite things to do is make absurd, completely false claims, and then insist that

32:44.200 --> 32:47.200
some impossibly long text actually proves him right.

32:47.200 --> 32:50.200
He's never read those texts, but it doesn't matter, because he knows that his audience

32:50.200 --> 32:52.200
hasn't and won't either.

32:52.200 --> 32:56.200
That's why he'll constantly just point at thousand-plus page books like Tragedy and

32:56.200 --> 33:01.200
Hope or Ecoscience and just insist that those things actually prove him right, and it's

33:01.200 --> 33:02.200
all in there.

33:02.200 --> 33:03.200
Yeah.

33:03.200 --> 33:06.200
It's a way of trying to railroad criticism and make it impossible for anyone to actually

33:06.200 --> 33:10.200
engage with the things that are being said unless they've read these really long books

33:10.200 --> 33:12.200
that Alex is pretending to have read.

33:12.200 --> 33:17.200
I would dig through the Nuremberg documents to disprove what Alex is saying, but he gives

33:17.200 --> 33:21.200
up his right to be taken seriously when he completely fabricates history like this.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.200
Yeah.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.200
But I couldn't help it, so I did dig around a little bit.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.200
Sure, sure, sure.

33:25.200 --> 33:29.200
This is from page 110 of volume 2 of the trial of major war criminals.

33:29.200 --> 33:34.200
This is spoken by Justice Robert Jackson, the chief U.S. prosecutor at the Nuremberg

33:34.200 --> 33:35.200
trials.

33:35.200 --> 33:39.200
Quote, the burning of this symbol of free parliamentary government was so providential

33:39.200 --> 33:42.200
for the Nazis that it was believed they staged the fire themselves.

33:42.200 --> 33:46.200
Certainly, when we contemplate their known crimes, we cannot believe they would shrink

33:46.200 --> 33:47.200
to mere arson.

33:47.200 --> 33:51.200
It's not necessary, however, to resolve the controversy as to who set the fire.

33:51.200 --> 33:54.200
So I guess if Alex is saying that it came out in the Nuremberg trials that the Nazis

33:54.200 --> 33:59.200
themselves set the fire, the chief U.S. prosecutor doesn't seem to be even making that indictment

33:59.200 --> 34:00.200
in the Nuremberg trials.

34:00.200 --> 34:05.200
And in fact, though it's generally accepted consensus that the Nazis did probably start

34:05.200 --> 34:08.200
the fire, definitive proof is hard to come by even today.

34:08.200 --> 34:13.200
Even the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum says, quote, the origins of the fire are still unclear.

34:13.200 --> 34:15.200
Sure, sure.

34:15.200 --> 34:21.200
I mean, I think the prosecutor really makes a good point, which is just like, ah, just

34:21.200 --> 34:22.200
add it.

34:22.200 --> 34:24.200
Just, Amy, take it off, add it.

34:24.200 --> 34:25.200
It doesn't matter.

34:25.200 --> 34:26.200
Yeah.

34:26.200 --> 34:27.200
Anytime.

34:27.200 --> 34:28.200
No, no, no.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.200
It's better just to be like, it doesn't even matter.

34:30.200 --> 34:31.200
Yeah, yeah.

34:31.200 --> 34:32.200
Who cares?

34:32.200 --> 34:33.200
What they did was horrible enough.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.200
That would be a genocide.

34:34.200 --> 34:35.200
A fire is not, yeah, yeah.

34:35.200 --> 34:36.200
Yeah.

34:36.200 --> 34:40.200
Anytime somebody is engaging in World War II revisionism, where they're like changing

34:40.200 --> 34:48.200
a little bit of the story away from Nazi genocide is to me like that sign that you're eventually

34:48.200 --> 34:52.640
going to try and get me to think that even if there was a problem with Hitler, it wasn't

34:52.640 --> 34:54.480
the genocide or the fascism part.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.200
I see you coming, sir.

34:56.200 --> 34:59.720
Yeah, Alex is really fucking weird on this.

34:59.720 --> 35:04.200
Like this really struck me as like, this is unnecessary.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.200
Yeah.

35:05.200 --> 35:13.400
He really is exposing of a either complete and total ignorance of history on Alex's part

35:13.400 --> 35:21.040
or a willingness to lie to his audience in a way to make history look like what he wants

35:21.040 --> 35:25.120
the present to look like to them in order to convince them of a lie about the present.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.120
No, totally.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.600
Which is like either of those are pretty bad looks.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.160
Yeah, I mean, what's that old saying?

35:31.160 --> 35:36.760
He who lies about the past controls the present and then becomes Senate Majority Leader.

35:36.760 --> 35:44.680
So we get a guest at this point on the 14th, he's a guy who hides in bushes.

35:44.680 --> 35:45.680
He's the Batman.

35:45.680 --> 35:46.680
He's the Batman.

35:46.680 --> 35:47.680
He's the Batman.

35:47.680 --> 35:48.680
It's John Rappaport.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.680
It's the Bats.

35:49.680 --> 35:54.520
John Rappaport hasn't been a guest on the show much in the recent history.

35:54.520 --> 35:58.900
So people who have just discovered our show recently probably won't know of our obsession

35:58.900 --> 35:59.900
with John Rappaport.

35:59.900 --> 36:03.480
He followed us on Twitter for a while.

36:03.480 --> 36:09.320
Several hundred episodes and then boom, much like the Bat, gone into the night.

36:09.320 --> 36:17.720
He is a guy who is a quote unquote investigative journalist, is an HIV denialist, is a real

36:17.720 --> 36:18.720
dick.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.720
I think he's hypnotizing Alex.

36:20.720 --> 36:25.320
Alex has an intense emotional reliance on him.

36:25.320 --> 36:29.600
Oftentimes whenever John hosts the fourth hour, Alex will do five minutes with him where

36:29.600 --> 36:32.800
he is just like, John, John, I need you, John.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.120
Just tell me I'm doing good.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.080
John, we love you so much, John Rappaport.

36:36.080 --> 36:37.640
Tell me I'm a good man, John.

36:37.640 --> 36:40.320
John, I just need to hear that I'm a good man.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.520
So his interview is not really all that great.

36:42.520 --> 36:46.240
It's kind of just about how like, you know, Aunt Aoife did that shit.

36:46.240 --> 36:51.120
Why do I feel like they went through the Rolodex of Infowars guests and were like, I guess Rappaport's

36:51.120 --> 36:54.840
the only one who hasn't been documented as saying we did it.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.160
We took over the Capitol in a positive way.

36:57.160 --> 37:00.840
There are there are a fair amount of like, wow, they're back.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.160
Like Mike Adams was back.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:03.160 --> 37:07.280
Like just the last couple episodes, Rappaport's here showing up later.

37:07.280 --> 37:10.240
We're going to get Steve Quayle is fucking back.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.920
Who here was against the coup?

37:11.920 --> 37:12.920
Who?

37:12.920 --> 37:13.920
Anybody raise their hands?

37:13.920 --> 37:14.920
Anybody?

37:14.920 --> 37:15.920
Oh, boy.

37:15.920 --> 37:16.920
Oh, not a lot of faces.

37:16.920 --> 37:17.920
OK.

37:17.920 --> 37:18.920
All right.

37:18.920 --> 37:21.160
So here's here's a little taste from their talk.

37:21.160 --> 37:23.840
Who is this guy standing next to him?

37:23.840 --> 37:25.640
Oh, well, he was arrested over here.

37:25.640 --> 37:30.640
You know, all of this comes tumbling out and arrested and let go.

37:30.640 --> 37:34.680
They've got this Antifa leader that you mentioned saying, burn the Capitol down on video.

37:34.680 --> 37:37.680
He was released.

37:37.680 --> 37:41.080
You know, it's like the Keystone Cops.

37:41.080 --> 37:45.240
So Alex is referencing John Sullivan, who is not an Antifa leader by any stretch of

37:45.240 --> 37:46.240
the word.

37:46.240 --> 37:50.520
Initially, Alex had been saying that this dude had been arrested and let go and he was

37:50.520 --> 37:52.360
making up both things.

37:52.360 --> 37:56.680
Since then, Sullivan had been arrested, but he wasn't really let go.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.680
He was released from jail without bail.

37:58.680 --> 38:01.960
But whenever Alex brings that up, he fails to mention that conditions of his release

38:01.960 --> 38:06.560
included surrendering his passport, having his computer activities monitored, being not

38:06.560 --> 38:10.120
allowed to go on social media and being under house arrest.

38:10.120 --> 38:11.900
He's definitely still in huge trouble.

38:11.900 --> 38:15.120
But the phrasing that he was released from jail is being misrepresented by people like

38:15.120 --> 38:18.320
Alex to imply that the charges have been dropped when that is not the case.

38:18.320 --> 38:23.600
Yeah, the legal system is not really their interest in portraying accurately.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.600
No.

38:24.600 --> 38:25.600
Capital letters and stuff.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.600
Yeah.

38:26.600 --> 38:30.160
Also, I don't know all the details, but Sullivan's not someone who left-wing activists seem to

38:30.160 --> 38:31.720
like.

38:31.720 --> 38:32.720
They hate him!

38:32.720 --> 38:33.720
And have for a while.

38:33.720 --> 38:34.720
Long good time.

38:34.720 --> 38:35.720
Yeah.

38:35.720 --> 38:38.280
There's an article on The Intercept that cites a number of activists from the West Coast

38:38.280 --> 38:42.720
who have raised concerns about him long before he went to DC.

38:42.720 --> 38:46.480
But anyway, weirdly, you know where I actually first saw John Sullivan?

38:46.480 --> 38:47.480
Where?

38:47.480 --> 38:48.480
The one that was shot at him for the first time?

38:48.480 --> 38:49.480
The Whole Foods?

38:49.480 --> 38:54.180
It was in the footage from inside the Capitol that was shot by the Infowars employee named

38:54.180 --> 38:55.180
Sam.

38:55.180 --> 38:56.180
Interesting.

38:56.180 --> 39:01.360
Here's Sam talking to John Sullivan just after that woman got shot, trying to get the footage

39:01.360 --> 39:03.880
that John Sullivan had shot of the incident.

39:03.880 --> 39:06.800
He actually saw her die.

39:06.800 --> 39:07.800
He actually saw her...

39:07.800 --> 39:08.800
I'll post the video.

39:08.800 --> 39:09.800
I have the video.

39:09.800 --> 39:10.800
I have the video of the guy with the gun and the shooter.

39:10.800 --> 39:11.800
I want to get with you.

39:11.800 --> 39:12.800
I'm with the Bullers.com.

39:12.800 --> 39:07.480
Just J-

39:07.480 --> 39:20.600
I haven't, but I will look it up.

39:20.600 --> 39:21.600
Okay.

39:21.600 --> 39:22.600
Infowars.com.

39:22.600 --> 39:23.600
Okay.

39:23.600 --> 39:24.600
I got you.

39:24.600 --> 39:25.600
I want to get your info right now if you got that shot.

39:25.600 --> 39:26.600
I have it.

39:26.600 --> 39:27.600
Oh, I was right behind the door.

39:27.600 --> 39:28.600
Okay.

39:28.600 --> 39:29.600
I need that footage, man.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.600
It's going to go out to the world.

39:30.600 --> 39:31.600
This has changed so much.

39:31.600 --> 39:36.000
I cannot believe that shit.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.140
So there's a couple of interesting things here.

39:38.140 --> 39:41.720
The first is obviously how ghoulish it is that these two are so interested in talking about

39:41.720 --> 39:45.680
how good their footage is of a woman being shot so soon after and so close to where the

39:45.680 --> 39:46.680
shooting happened.

39:46.680 --> 39:50.880
There's a real grim voyeurism on display here that I think reflects poorly on them both.

39:50.880 --> 39:51.880
Yeah.

39:51.880 --> 39:55.800
Secondly, it's interesting to me that John seems unaware of Infowars.

39:55.800 --> 39:59.360
If he were really an Antifa provocateur who was there to set up the Patriots and make

39:59.360 --> 40:02.700
them look bad, it seems strange that he would sound completely unfamiliar with the name

40:02.700 --> 40:06.240
Infowars who are supposed to be the patsies and fall guys of this whole thing.

40:06.240 --> 40:09.960
Conversely, if he really were a left-wing activist, it seems unlikely that he would

40:09.960 --> 40:14.440
be unaware of Infowars in that circumstance, too, given that they're a media organization

40:14.440 --> 40:20.240
that proves and poses a very real and relevant threat to left-wing activist communities.

40:20.240 --> 40:23.500
I honestly don't know what to make of their exchange, and I can't possibly imagine how

40:23.500 --> 40:27.000
difficult it would be to process information after seeing someone get shot.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.820
So not recognizing a name could just be a brain lapse.

40:29.820 --> 40:31.120
I have no idea.

40:31.120 --> 40:34.340
But I do think it's pretty funny to look at the dynamics here.

40:34.340 --> 40:38.960
On the 6th, when Alex was on his own show, he was touting this footage that he'd gotten

40:38.960 --> 40:41.500
from inside the Capitol of the shooting.

40:41.500 --> 40:46.180
That footage was shot by Sam, the Infowars employee, and John Sullivan was the other

40:46.180 --> 40:51.400
footage that Alex had, who has now turned out to be an Antifa agent provocateur.

40:51.400 --> 40:55.520
I honestly wonder if Alex even realizes that the person that Sam got footage from to send

40:55.520 --> 40:57.160
to Alex was John Sullivan.

40:57.160 --> 40:58.720
Plausible deniability.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.400
I bet Alex doesn't even realize.

41:00.400 --> 41:01.400
He doesn't care.

41:01.400 --> 41:02.400
No.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.400
Yeah, it's bad for him to know that.

41:03.400 --> 41:04.400
Yep.

41:04.400 --> 41:05.400
Yep.

41:05.400 --> 41:06.400
So now we get another guest on.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.680
It's an online right-wing talk show host.

41:08.680 --> 41:11.720
I'm not sure if I've ever heard him be on Alex's show before.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.720
He might have been.

41:12.720 --> 41:13.720
I'm not sure.

41:13.720 --> 41:14.720
Pete Santilli.

41:14.720 --> 41:15.720
Okay.

41:15.720 --> 41:16.720
The Santilli Lace.

41:16.720 --> 41:17.720
Okay.

41:17.720 --> 41:18.720
I couldn't help it.

41:18.720 --> 41:19.720
Yeah.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.320
I don't like this guy, but I also am not interested.

41:21.320 --> 41:27.520
Then on January 20th, our commander in chief hasn't called us to a peaceful protest to

41:27.520 --> 41:28.600
Washington, D.C.

41:28.600 --> 41:32.000
He just said, wherever you protest, protest peacefully.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.120
I believe that they're setting the stage.

41:34.120 --> 41:38.460
The FBI said that they forewarned the Capitol Police that there were going to be some agitators

41:38.460 --> 41:39.460
coming in.

41:39.460 --> 41:40.460
How do they know that?

41:40.460 --> 41:43.880
Because those agitators worked for the FBI.

41:43.880 --> 41:47.540
They had let the Capitol Police's guard down.

41:47.540 --> 41:49.160
They allowed this thing to take place.

41:49.160 --> 41:51.480
They had their operatives breaking the window.

41:51.480 --> 41:54.200
And then obviously the emotion involved in just walking.

41:54.200 --> 41:59.480
Well, we got three years ago from 2018, but it was from 2015.

41:59.480 --> 42:03.360
The headline info wars was Obama planned martial law in Maryland.

42:03.360 --> 42:04.360
How'd that go?

42:04.360 --> 42:09.000
And the documents are there where they plan to like go provocateur and get it to be triggered.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.160
And we actually have the anti-fidocuments.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.160
That's what they do.

42:12.160 --> 42:13.840
Yeah, those documents still aren't real.

42:13.840 --> 42:17.080
They're still definitely just something that Harrison Smith found when he was cruising

42:17.080 --> 42:18.080
around 4chan.

42:18.080 --> 42:21.920
No contracts with the Soros son, Dan.

42:21.920 --> 42:26.320
So Pete Santilli is a guy who's like a radio show host, but he's only relevant at all because

42:26.320 --> 42:29.720
he was arrested at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge occupation.

42:29.720 --> 42:30.720
Sure.

42:30.720 --> 42:34.280
The charges ultimately were dropped against him, most likely because he was both occupying

42:34.280 --> 42:36.620
the refuge and pretending to be a journalist.

42:36.620 --> 42:39.700
So they didn't even want to fuck around and try and figure out how that first amendment

42:39.700 --> 42:40.700
needle gets threaded.

42:40.700 --> 42:41.700
And like, ah, who cares?

42:41.700 --> 42:46.660
Much like who set the Reichstag fire, they're like, Jesus Christ, that's just too much.

42:46.660 --> 42:47.660
It's too much.

42:47.660 --> 42:48.660
It's too much.

42:48.660 --> 42:55.840
And he's on just to try and help Alex convince people that the feds set people up and that,

42:55.840 --> 42:59.480
you know, like coming weekend, it's all going to be a mess.

42:59.480 --> 43:04.080
There's going to be agent provocateur events, mass shootings, bombings.

43:04.080 --> 43:06.800
And now that we're here recording this on Tuesday,

43:06.800 --> 43:12.680
I think it's, I think it's fascinating to me just because in some ways this is kind

43:12.680 --> 43:18.200
of the only way that these people would be able to try and keep their people from committing

43:18.200 --> 43:23.120
mass acts of violence because they can't come out and say, we were lying to you because

43:23.120 --> 43:26.360
then the people will be like, uh, no, you weren't.

43:26.360 --> 43:28.040
Or you're lying to us now.

43:28.040 --> 43:29.220
Or it doesn't matter.

43:29.220 --> 43:30.960
We still want to overthrow the Capitol.

43:30.960 --> 43:36.080
But if you say that, if you go, you're going to be a provocateur and then blamed, that's

43:36.080 --> 43:39.980
more likely to cut through the, it's like, it's like when you're talking to a child in

43:39.980 --> 43:44.320
pretend land, you have to talk to the pretend land child, not the regular one.

43:44.320 --> 43:45.320
Yeah.

43:45.320 --> 43:51.880
But if you just say something along the lines of like complete denunciation of violence,

43:51.880 --> 43:55.880
you stand to lose a certain amount of your audience who will think that you've sold out

43:55.880 --> 44:01.880
or something because that is how information is filtered for a lot of these communities.

44:01.880 --> 44:02.880
Yeah.

44:02.880 --> 44:06.160
You have to be like, okay, yeah, yeah, you want to do this and you're right to want to

44:06.160 --> 44:11.600
do it, but if you do it, it's a trap and you'll be a symbol that'll bring all your brethren

44:11.600 --> 44:12.600
down.

44:12.600 --> 44:13.600
Totally.

44:13.600 --> 44:14.600
That is probably the only way.

44:14.600 --> 44:15.600
Yeah.

44:15.600 --> 44:16.600
Yeah.

44:16.600 --> 44:17.600
Yeah.

44:17.600 --> 44:18.600
It's, it's weird.

44:18.600 --> 44:19.600
You have to play the game.

44:19.600 --> 44:20.600
It doesn't really work for everyone.

44:20.600 --> 44:21.600
I don't know.

44:21.600 --> 44:22.600
Yeah, we'll see.

44:22.600 --> 44:23.600
Anyway, this was pretty fun.

44:23.600 --> 44:29.740
Uh, Pete Santilli has one big message and it's like, yeah, all right, I believe I can.

44:29.740 --> 44:34.560
What I want everybody to understand right now is that your most trusted people that

44:34.560 --> 44:40.600
you have around you are going to be the ones that you will, you will be shocked that they're

44:40.600 --> 44:43.360
actually working for this entity.

44:43.360 --> 44:45.680
There's trillions of dollars at stake.

44:45.680 --> 44:50.360
Your security person may be paid a hundred thousand dollars to set you up, to gather

44:50.360 --> 44:56.320
enough information in order for you to make a statement on recording, uh, and, uh, and

44:56.320 --> 44:58.080
essentially be used in an indictment.

44:58.080 --> 45:01.160
So Pete's messages, nobody in the right wing can be trusted.

45:01.160 --> 45:07.140
Hey, listen, everyone, everyone will absolutely abandon you the moment that it is expedient

45:07.140 --> 45:08.140
for them to do so.

45:08.140 --> 45:09.140
Yes.

45:09.140 --> 45:12.920
Everyone in this right wing community has a fucking price tag and you can't afford them.

45:12.920 --> 45:13.920
Yeah.

45:13.920 --> 45:18.280
Have you guys, did you guys ever hear about Stalin's closest, uh, Politburo friends and

45:18.280 --> 45:19.280
all that stuff?

45:19.280 --> 45:22.160
Did you ever notice how they backstabbed each other all the goddamn time?

45:22.160 --> 45:23.160
Well, guess what?

45:23.160 --> 45:24.160
That's what fascism is.

45:24.160 --> 45:26.560
Well, I know that, uh, Stalin burned down the Reich tag.

45:26.560 --> 45:27.560
Yes.

45:27.560 --> 45:28.560
Why not?

45:28.560 --> 45:29.560
Why not?

45:29.560 --> 45:31.560
We don't have time to figure it out, Dan.

45:31.560 --> 45:36.840
So, uh, Pete, uh, makes a bit of an accusation here that, uh, I found distasteful.

45:36.840 --> 45:40.600
I believe, and we're getting information now that there were maps that were put out.

45:40.600 --> 45:47.920
A guy named John Sullivan, who is a known BLM and Tifa, uh, activist just so happened

45:47.920 --> 45:53.340
to be present with her, uh, how she was able to determine that going through the labyrinth

45:53.340 --> 45:57.920
of the, you know, the hallways in the halls of Congress, how she was able to get to that

45:57.920 --> 46:04.060
one particular spot where secret service would be, I'm sure was provoked by John Sullivan.

46:04.060 --> 46:05.560
She's very emotionally involved.

46:05.560 --> 46:09.560
They break the window, she goes up there, she gets shot.

46:09.560 --> 46:13.920
I gotta say, it feels kinda like defamation to just randomly imply that just because Sullivan

46:13.920 --> 46:17.880
was near Ashley when she got shot that somehow he led her there.

46:17.880 --> 46:21.280
If the standard for making that accusation is that low, then it could easily be said

46:21.280 --> 46:25.040
that Alex's cameraman, Sam, must have led her to where she got shot since he was right

46:25.040 --> 46:26.040
there too.

46:26.040 --> 46:27.040
Oh shit, Sam's Antifa.

46:27.040 --> 46:28.040
Oh no.

46:28.040 --> 46:29.040
God damn it, Sam.

46:29.040 --> 46:33.240
Oh, and Troyer's Black Lives Matter flag burning friend Taylor Hansen was right there too,

46:33.240 --> 46:35.080
so he must have been the one who led her there.

46:35.080 --> 46:36.080
Antifa.

46:36.080 --> 46:39.760
There's a very serious accusation that Pete is making based on nothing, and the only reason

46:39.760 --> 46:43.400
he's doing it is so that he doesn't have to feel bad about being an active participant

46:43.400 --> 46:47.840
in the media ecosystem that misinforms and radicalizes people like Ashley to the point

46:47.840 --> 46:50.560
where she thought it was a good idea to storm the Capitol.

46:50.560 --> 46:54.440
He can't take that really hard look in the mirror, so the best way to put that off is

46:54.440 --> 46:58.320
to come up with a convenient story where someone else is the bad guy who actually secretly

46:58.320 --> 47:02.200
had machinations to lead to this.

47:02.200 --> 47:08.400
Yeah, at no point in time can that man just say, wait, I think it was me and my ilk that

47:08.400 --> 47:09.400
led her there.

47:09.400 --> 47:10.400
Oh.

47:10.400 --> 47:14.320
Maybe there are real world consequences for bullshit.

47:14.320 --> 47:19.160
Oh no, if I have that reflection, I have to change my behavior or recognize that I'm a

47:19.160 --> 47:21.160
villain while I profit off it.

47:21.160 --> 47:22.160
Oh no.

47:22.160 --> 47:23.160
Yeah.

47:23.160 --> 47:24.160
Oh.

47:24.160 --> 47:25.320
Anyway, good luck, Pete.

47:25.320 --> 47:28.840
So Alex keeps lying about Roger's wife, and we don't need to hear more of it because it's

47:28.840 --> 47:30.640
basically just the same thing over and over again.

47:30.640 --> 47:31.640
Yeah, yeah, sure.

47:31.640 --> 47:37.000
We've got another guest on, and I think that this guest has listened to our show.

47:37.000 --> 47:44.120
It's Ezra Levant from Rebel Media, and I really think, tell me if you know why I think that.

47:44.120 --> 47:45.540
What happened at the Capitol?

47:45.540 --> 47:46.540
What's your view?

47:46.540 --> 47:47.540
What's coming next?

47:47.540 --> 47:49.240
Ezra Levant of Rebel Media.

47:49.240 --> 47:57.560
Well, look, we all know the phrase fake news, and you can battle fake news on a daily basis,

47:57.560 --> 48:03.920
but what happens when the news cements, when that cement hardens, and it becomes history?

48:03.920 --> 48:07.120
You can't even unargue or dislodge it.

48:07.120 --> 48:11.640
I'm not saying that I came up with that metaphor, but it's something that I've used in this

48:11.640 --> 48:18.600
very specific context many times, and he uses it multiple times in this interview.

48:18.600 --> 48:21.080
And I was just sitting here like, you motherfucker.

48:21.080 --> 48:24.280
You can't weaponize my own shit against me?

48:24.280 --> 48:25.280
Dickweed.

48:25.280 --> 48:27.160
So anyway, that guy sucks.

48:27.160 --> 48:28.160
Very interesting.

48:28.160 --> 48:31.080
As an interview, we're going to jump to the 15th.

48:31.080 --> 48:33.080
So the 15th is Friday.

48:33.080 --> 48:37.400
I hope he does listen to our show so we can find out how little we give a fuck about it.

48:37.400 --> 48:38.400
Yeah, don't care.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.400
Piece of shit.

48:39.400 --> 48:40.920
Go cry to Tommy Robinson about cement.

48:40.920 --> 48:41.920
No shit.

48:41.920 --> 48:42.920
Fuck you.

48:42.920 --> 48:48.720
Anyway, so we had some vaccine-possibly-related deaths in Norway, and Alex is covering that

48:48.720 --> 48:49.720
story.

48:49.720 --> 48:57.120
I can spend an hour just on this little darling right here from Infowars.com, which is the

48:57.120 --> 48:58.120
story.

48:58.120 --> 49:02.560
Just got links to mainstream Reuters, you name it, foreign news, Norway TV.

49:02.560 --> 49:07.440
23 dead in Norway after taking COVID vaccine, and they said, that's okay, it's going to

49:07.440 --> 49:08.440
kill some people.

49:08.440 --> 49:11.160
See, they're now just normalizing the death.

49:11.160 --> 49:12.460
That's just one article here.

49:12.460 --> 49:16.120
So this is an instance where the headline can look pretty scary, but the actual story

49:16.120 --> 49:20.120
might not actually be as much of a cause for alarm as it seems.

49:20.120 --> 49:23.960
The first thing to be clear about is that these deaths that have happened in Norway

49:23.960 --> 49:26.160
are obviously being studied.

49:26.160 --> 49:30.200
And at the time of this episode, there's not been any causal link that's been made between

49:30.200 --> 49:34.760
the vaccine and these deaths, which is important to nail down.

49:34.760 --> 49:38.880
If Alex had actually read some of the underlying information that this Infowars article is

49:38.880 --> 49:43.600
based on, like there's a CNN article, you would have read this explanation from Stephen

49:43.600 --> 49:49.200
Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical

49:49.200 --> 49:50.200
Medicine.

49:50.200 --> 49:55.800
Quote, Evans told the UK's Science Media Center that when people who are at high risk of death

49:55.800 --> 49:59.800
get vaccinated, there will be a certain number of coincidental deaths that occur shortly

49:59.800 --> 50:01.560
after vaccination.

50:01.560 --> 50:05.760
Regulatory bodies across the world are closely monitoring these fatalities, Evans said, and

50:05.760 --> 50:09.960
are able to calculate the expected number of deaths within various time periods.

50:09.960 --> 50:15.960
Quote, we do not yet know, but it would seem that the observed numbers of deaths is not

50:15.960 --> 50:20.240
notably above the numbers expected, he said, adding that there was, quote, no need for

50:20.240 --> 50:23.560
anxiety but complacency is equally mistaken.

50:23.560 --> 50:27.600
If we're vaccinating people who are going to die soon, some of them are going to die

50:27.600 --> 50:30.140
soon after we vaccinate them.

50:30.140 --> 50:37.000
People who are in high risk categories may have a higher expectation of coincidental

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
death.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.200
That is a factor that needs to be taken into account.

50:41.200 --> 50:47.080
Also the possibilities brought up in these articles of minor side effects possibly being

50:47.080 --> 50:53.520
much more serious issues for people with more complications.

50:53.520 --> 50:59.520
Anyway, I think that if you look at something like how this guy, Steven Evans, is explaining

50:59.520 --> 51:02.920
the situation, I think that sounds very responsible.

51:02.920 --> 51:08.360
Because he has both sides sort of reflected there, which is like, there's reasons why

51:08.360 --> 51:10.280
this number would be there.

51:10.280 --> 51:12.680
People are looking at it and will understand this better.

51:12.680 --> 51:17.040
This is not a reason to be super worried, but it's also not a reason to just be like,

51:17.040 --> 51:18.040
eh, whatever.

51:18.040 --> 51:19.840
And I think that's fair.

51:19.840 --> 51:26.600
I remember when I was young, when I was little, they had kids Bibles, you know, that were

51:26.600 --> 51:31.880
illustrated and they simplified a lot of the stories and they left out all the rapes.

51:31.880 --> 51:36.080
And I think that's what we need for like science news journalists.

51:36.080 --> 51:40.760
We need to give them like the kiddie version of real science and they can disseminate that

51:40.760 --> 51:45.240
so people don't get too scared, you know, because we can't be having people with headlines

51:45.240 --> 51:52.960
like vaccine involved in two deaths.

51:52.960 --> 51:54.320
That headline is true.

51:54.320 --> 51:55.320
Yeah.

51:55.320 --> 51:56.320
Well, no, it's not.

51:56.320 --> 51:59.240
I mean, 23 people died after getting the vaccine.

51:59.240 --> 52:06.400
It's unclear if it's related or connected in how many of the cases it is, is unclear.

52:06.400 --> 52:13.600
But yeah, the headline itself can be weaponized so easily by people with the wrong information.

52:13.600 --> 52:16.640
Yeah, it'd be good.

52:16.640 --> 52:20.800
Messaging is critical at this point with medical information, I think.

52:20.800 --> 52:25.640
I would change that headline to tens of millions vaccinated without dying.

52:25.640 --> 52:32.280
Unsurprisingly statistically relevant, but unsurprising so far at this point in time.

52:32.280 --> 52:34.680
Let's go back to the old tracks from the 60s.

52:34.680 --> 52:38.600
I want Thomas Paine to start writing our fucking headlines.

52:38.600 --> 52:39.600
That's what we got to do.

52:39.600 --> 52:40.600
Okay.

52:40.600 --> 52:41.600
Okay.

52:41.600 --> 52:42.600
We'll take that under advisement.

52:42.600 --> 52:43.600
Yes.

52:43.600 --> 52:44.600
Alex has another headline.

52:44.600 --> 52:45.600
Okay.

52:45.600 --> 52:46.600
Study.

52:46.600 --> 52:51.320
COVID lockdown harms are 10 times greater than benefits and causes more people to die

52:51.320 --> 52:59.440
from suicide, drug addiction, drug overdose, and more, but that's okay.

52:59.440 --> 53:04.480
I can tell from the phrasing of the headline that Alex is reading there that it's a post

53:04.480 --> 53:07.080
in an outlet called the Dhaka Tribune.

53:07.080 --> 53:09.840
I didn't know that Alex kept up with the Bangladeshi media.

53:09.840 --> 53:10.840
Ooh.

53:10.840 --> 53:13.920
One of his interns just has a Google alert for lockdown studies and this one hit the

53:13.920 --> 53:14.920
filter.

53:14.920 --> 53:15.920
Sure.

53:15.920 --> 53:19.080
This was an article published on January 11th about a paper put out by a Canadian doctor

53:19.080 --> 53:21.760
of pediatrics named Ari Joff.

53:21.760 --> 53:26.120
The paper is called COVID-19 Rethinking the Lockdown Groupthink and it's not been published

53:26.120 --> 53:28.440
by anyone nor is it peer reviewed.

53:28.440 --> 53:29.440
Odd.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.160
Also it was written last October.

53:31.160 --> 53:33.080
Alex absolutely didn't read this paper.

53:33.080 --> 53:36.920
One of his interns just sent him the headline from an outlet in Bangladesh covering a Canadian

53:36.920 --> 53:39.280
paper that no one cared about three months ago.

53:39.280 --> 53:40.280
Great.

53:40.280 --> 53:41.280
Great.

53:41.280 --> 53:42.280
Bad work.

53:42.280 --> 53:43.280
Great.

53:43.280 --> 53:44.280
Great.

53:44.280 --> 53:45.280
Great.

53:45.280 --> 53:46.280
Just great.

53:46.280 --> 53:51.680
Now Alex gets to a point where he kind of thinks, well, maybe we've got to move on.

53:51.680 --> 53:53.000
Maybe we've got to move on from Trump.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Okay.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.040
I think he's starting to have those feelings of like, we must move forward.

53:58.040 --> 54:04.480
I could snap my fingers and come out against Trump and come out against the second amendment

54:04.480 --> 54:08.160
and I can't get into details because it's private things that are done.

54:08.160 --> 54:12.320
This is how the law works as long as something is illegal, I will go have private meetings

54:12.320 --> 54:16.240
with the globalists and their minions and, but I mean, I can snap my fingers and betray

54:16.240 --> 54:20.680
the second amendment, betray America, betray Trump to make it so easy.

54:20.680 --> 54:24.560
Just come out against the second amendment just a little bit, come out for red flag laws

54:24.560 --> 54:29.080
or, or, or come out for just against Trump a little or, or just leave radical Islam alone

54:29.080 --> 54:34.280
or just stop harping on this pedophilia thing all day and all your problems will stop Jones.

54:34.280 --> 54:35.280
Yeah.

54:35.280 --> 54:37.040
Jones, you can come back into the fold right now.

54:37.040 --> 54:38.880
Jones, you'd come back in.

54:38.880 --> 54:39.880
Really I can.

54:39.880 --> 54:40.880
Great.

54:40.880 --> 54:41.880
No, I don't.

54:41.880 --> 54:42.880
I don't want to come back in your fold.

54:42.880 --> 54:43.920
I've never been in your fold.

54:43.920 --> 54:46.840
I don't want to be in your fold, but that's where this is.

54:46.840 --> 54:51.020
People say, well, Jones, you just said red flag laws is one of their stipulations.

54:51.020 --> 54:52.680
Trump said he was for that.

54:52.680 --> 54:53.680
Trump said that.

54:53.680 --> 54:55.700
So they would say we want total gun confiscation.

54:55.700 --> 54:56.700
And so he would shut it all down.

54:56.700 --> 54:57.700
I agree.

54:57.700 --> 54:58.700
It was a mistake.

54:58.700 --> 55:02.480
I said it was whenever I talk about something Trump did, why he thought he did the right

55:02.480 --> 55:03.480
thing.

55:03.480 --> 55:06.120
I'm so you can get my take on why he did it.

55:06.120 --> 55:07.120
Doesn't mean I agree with him.

55:07.120 --> 55:10.480
He said, hey, you shouldn't have to take the vaccine.

55:10.480 --> 55:11.480
But oh, here it is.

55:11.480 --> 55:12.480
Let's turn the economy back on.

55:12.480 --> 55:15.560
Cause he gets, that's the main mission is shut the economy back off.

55:15.560 --> 55:18.440
Doesn't mean I agree with him trying to defeat them in that capacity.

55:18.440 --> 55:24.480
And it failed and he failed to do the right thing when it came to the censorship.

55:24.480 --> 55:25.600
And now he knows that.

55:25.600 --> 55:27.800
And now the whole world knows that it doesn't matter.

55:27.800 --> 55:29.520
Now we move on.

55:29.520 --> 55:34.720
Now it's Joe Biden who is a fraud who we will never accept, who is going to come after us

55:34.720 --> 55:35.720
hardcore.

55:35.720 --> 55:39.840
He's going to get on the offense against him because he runs a globalist crime family against

55:39.840 --> 55:42.440
our nation as fully compromised.

55:42.440 --> 55:46.000
So Trump will be gone in five days.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Trust the plan, right?

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
Unbelievable.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
We'll be right back.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
I'm Alex Jones.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
Tomorrow's news of the day.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
Infowars.com.

55:52.000 --> 55:55.440
This dude's so mad about QAnon.

55:55.440 --> 55:57.320
Man, that's just bad writing.

55:57.320 --> 56:00.120
That's just bad fanfic is what we just heard right there.

56:00.120 --> 56:03.480
There's also, there's something interesting and paradoxical about Alex ranting about how

56:03.480 --> 56:07.240
the globalists want him to turn on Trump, but he won't do it only for him to then end

56:07.240 --> 56:09.480
his rant by saying we have to move on to fight Joe Biden.

56:09.480 --> 56:10.480
Well, sure.

56:10.480 --> 56:13.920
I guess it's not turning on Trump, but leaving that season of his show behind, maybe?

56:13.920 --> 56:15.040
Yeah, just toss it.

56:15.040 --> 56:17.280
If you're Alex, you don't get to do this.

56:17.280 --> 56:20.840
You don't get to whip your audience into an apocalyptic fervor about how Trump was appointed

56:20.840 --> 56:24.720
to be ruler by God and this election is a spiritual battle between Trump's godliness

56:24.720 --> 56:26.200
and the literal devil.

56:26.200 --> 56:28.320
Then when it's time to move on, you just say, we move on.

56:28.320 --> 56:30.240
Personally, I'm stoked the devil won.

56:30.240 --> 56:31.240
He's a good dude.

56:31.240 --> 56:32.840
I guess we've talked a little bit.

56:32.840 --> 56:33.840
He's everywhere.

56:33.840 --> 56:38.680
Alex promised the end of days and the fucking devil if Biden got in and guess what?

56:38.680 --> 56:42.520
It's probably just going to be a slightly disappointing government that Alex is just

56:42.520 --> 56:44.720
going to make a bunch of money yelling about.

56:44.720 --> 56:45.720
Fucking bullshit.

56:45.720 --> 56:49.080
Also, I want to point out this thing that Alex has been doing a lot lately that I find

56:49.080 --> 56:50.500
really offensive.

56:50.500 --> 56:54.160
He keeps talking about how he could join the globalists so easy.

56:54.160 --> 56:58.180
They want him on their side and at any minute he could be one of the elites.

56:58.180 --> 57:01.920
This is meant to be heard by the audience like an abusive spouse yelling about how they

57:01.920 --> 57:03.480
could do so much better.

57:03.480 --> 57:07.380
The message is really clear that Alex could join the globalists whenever he wants because

57:07.380 --> 57:11.500
he's special, but no one listening has the same offer extended to them because they are

57:11.500 --> 57:12.500
not special.

57:12.500 --> 57:13.500
Yep.

57:13.500 --> 57:15.000
And you should be glad that I'm not joining these globalists.

57:15.000 --> 57:20.400
You are fucking lucky I choose to shine my light on you assholes.

57:20.400 --> 57:21.400
Yeah.

57:21.400 --> 57:23.700
It's dark.

57:23.700 --> 57:25.680
It's really narcissistic and gross.

57:25.680 --> 57:26.680
Yeah.

57:26.680 --> 57:27.680
Yeah.

57:27.680 --> 57:28.680
I don't enjoy it.

57:28.680 --> 57:30.360
I would prefer he didn't do that or exist.

57:30.360 --> 57:39.640
Well, I mean, if he didn't exist, I know there's at least two people in the world who would

57:39.640 --> 57:42.680
miss him.

57:42.680 --> 57:44.200
I got the wrong clip here.

57:44.200 --> 57:45.200
Thinking real hard.

57:45.200 --> 57:46.760
I got the wrong clip here.

57:46.760 --> 57:51.800
Later Alex says that two famous people told him something.

57:51.800 --> 57:55.240
This is a clip where two people tell him about one single famous person.

57:55.240 --> 57:56.240
Okay.

57:56.240 --> 57:57.240
Alright.

57:57.240 --> 57:58.240
We gotta talk famous people.

57:58.240 --> 57:59.240
Rewind.

57:59.240 --> 58:00.240
Didn't hear that part.

58:00.240 --> 58:01.240
There's one person.

58:01.240 --> 58:02.240
2021.

58:02.240 --> 58:03.240
Blackjack.

58:03.240 --> 58:04.240
Yay.

58:04.240 --> 58:05.240
There's one person.

58:05.240 --> 58:06.240
Maybe.

58:06.240 --> 58:09.520
If Alex didn't exist, one person who's very famous who would be very sad.

58:09.520 --> 58:10.520
Oh.

58:10.520 --> 58:11.520
Christopher Watson?

58:11.520 --> 58:12.640
Paul Watson asked me like, what's going on with Jack Dorsey?

58:12.640 --> 58:16.200
He says he's for free speech and he hates the fact that Trump was censored, but then

58:16.200 --> 58:19.680
now there's this video where he's admitting it all, that he is censoring to his employees.

58:19.680 --> 58:22.400
He's like a man with a gun to his head and I think that's basically it.

58:22.400 --> 58:25.800
He's blackmailed for whatever reason it is.

58:25.800 --> 58:27.840
And so I told Paul, why not just tell you this now?

58:27.840 --> 58:28.960
It's not like a bragging thing.

58:28.960 --> 58:29.960
I don't care.

58:29.960 --> 58:30.960
It's actually weird.

58:30.960 --> 58:31.960
I think it's strange.

58:31.960 --> 58:39.200
I've been told by two famous prominent people that Jack Dorsey says Alex Jones is always

58:39.200 --> 58:42.740
right and that I'm like his guru.

58:42.740 --> 58:45.000
And then there's this big famous Hollywood producer.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.200
I'm not going to go any further.

58:47.200 --> 58:53.360
This big music producer that like is like their guru and then he's like, I'm being told

58:53.360 --> 58:55.600
this by two separate really famous people.

58:55.600 --> 58:58.400
And this is like a while back and I'm like, okay, all right.

58:58.400 --> 59:02.600
I mean, you can't make up the weirdness level.

59:02.600 --> 59:05.600
This is right before Phil Spector died, right?

59:05.600 --> 59:08.160
Yeah, I think so.

59:08.160 --> 59:11.680
This famous music producer fucking loves me.

59:11.680 --> 59:13.320
He's my, he loves me.

59:13.320 --> 59:14.800
He's a famous music producer.

59:14.800 --> 59:18.000
He's saying this was a while back, so it could have been Manson.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
That's fair.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
That's fair.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Yeah, man.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.560
I don't know.

59:24.560 --> 59:26.320
Let's imagine this is true.

59:26.320 --> 59:29.920
Do you have something better to do with your time on the show?

59:29.920 --> 59:31.480
No, no he doesn't.

59:31.480 --> 59:35.800
Why are you talking about Jack Dorsey?

59:35.800 --> 59:38.640
Jack Dorsey looks at me like I'm his guru.

59:38.640 --> 59:43.560
I'm really, really done with anybody treating a rich person like they're real.

59:43.560 --> 59:45.600
Like what's going on with Jack Dorsey?

59:45.600 --> 59:46.760
No, no, no.

59:46.760 --> 59:47.760
What's going on?

59:47.760 --> 59:48.760
Don't care.

59:48.760 --> 59:49.760
Money!

59:49.760 --> 59:50.760
The end.

59:50.760 --> 59:51.760
Jordan, I don't even care about Jack Dorsey.

59:51.760 --> 59:53.080
I want to talk about Alex Jones being his guru.

59:53.080 --> 59:54.080
Sure.

59:54.080 --> 59:55.080
Okay.

59:55.080 --> 59:56.080
All right.

59:56.080 --> 59:58.040
So in a sense, money is the only thing he cares about.

59:58.040 --> 01:00:04.200
Well, I mean, it must have felt terrible to kick your guru off of your own platform.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.200
Yeah.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.200
Ban him.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.200
Multiple times.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.200
Absolutely.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:13.640
And leave David Knight on.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.160
David Knight is my nightlight.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.120
I just think about this like you get kicked out of a bar and later you're like the bouncer,

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.120
I'm his hero.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.000
He's my, he loves me.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.400
Guy fucking loves me.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:29.120
Broke his heart to kick my ass out of there.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.120
Yeah.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.560
But hey, look, Alex didn't tell that story to be powerful.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:39.680
By the way, folks, I didn't tell you that Jack Dorsey story to sound powerful or cool.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.680
I don't want to be part of Hollywood.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.160
I want to be part of the Washington power structure.

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:50.680
It really is true that you cannot register or fathom how popular Infowars really is now.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.320
And that was all God's plan.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.720
And that was all you keeping us on air.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.720
All of us together.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.720
It was a team effort.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:00.560
It's extremely dangerous position to be in as well, but almost all these liberal talk

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.720
show hosts attack me.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:02.720
They actually listen.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:06.360
I remember Mike Cernovich about five years ago, four years ago, he was visiting here.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.240
He says, don't you know, they all love you and they all listen all the time.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.480
And don't you know, all those big people like Jack Dorsey and all them are huge fans.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.400
And I'm like, dude, stop trying to build my ego up.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.400
I don't want to hear this.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.400
That's bull.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.520
It's all true, but I appreciate it.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.600
It is all bull.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:27.800
Can't believe anything Mike Cernovich says for one and then for two, uh, man, this is

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.800
sad.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.800
This is really grim.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.800
This is bad.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.280
I guess, you know what?

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.720
The only people that I could really make a solid case who really dislike him, but do

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.520
listen to him are me.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:43.000
The yeah, that would be us.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.560
So Alex is a confusing man in many ways.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.560
Agreed.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.680
He has certain tastes.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.680
Disgusting ones.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:55.440
He has a crush on somebody Roger Stone's daughter.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.440
This really happened.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:01.920
I remember about a year ago visiting my, a little bit over a year ago, my, my wife's

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.640
mother in San Diego.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:09.600
And so her house is little, so we said, well, let's go to this nice country club that has

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.600
a hotel.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.600
Beautiful place.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.440
It was the Fairmount beautiful hotel on a golf course.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.160
We could walk around the golf course and stuff.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.160
I'm rich.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:26.000
All the chemical spraying that they add to the jet fuel and it's all in the patents and

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Solomon.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
It's all in the Nobel prizes.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I mean, it's been going on since the mid nineties.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.160
It's a perfect case of this industrial globalist takeover houses there and general public doesn't

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.800
know, but it's hidden in plain view.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.320
I said, man, I want to have a website or a podcast.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:46.240
I told my wife this called Kim trails and country clubs because you're in this beautiful

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:50.440
country club, these beautiful pools, beautiful statues, five star hotel.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.660
I never stayed somewhere that nice.

01:02:52.660 --> 01:03:00.400
And there's Kim trails everywhere and it's just raining down everyone.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:03.240
And it's that symbol of how this has happened to everyone.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.480
So then I get up about 5 a.m.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:13.640
I've got to go get on the computer and research and I see, oh, well, that's it.

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:18.280
This big pop star.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:29.280
She must be an Alex Jones lister because her new album is called Kim trails over the country

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.920
club.

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:42.280
Lana Del Rey, Alex continues being super still going on into Atlanta, Del Ray, super into

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.720
Lana Del Rey.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.160
It's awesome.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:50.520
He's so into this Kim trails over the, over the country club and he can't even enjoy it.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.120
He can't even enjoy it.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.120
He loves it.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:59.600
He loves her and he can't publicly, he has to spend a fucking 10 minute jag on how famous

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:05.400
he is to God damn tech people, but he can't even come out and say he loves Lana Del Rey.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.760
Now Alex, I would like for you to challenge yourself and explain to me how much you love

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.600
the song born to die.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:20.280
Oh, Hey Alex, why don't you watch the national Anthem video and tell me what you think about

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:23.960
that.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:24.960
Separate the art from the artist.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.960
This is what you got to do.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.360
You got to separate the art from the artist.

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.920
It's just so great.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:34.920
It's so great that he has just out of like the last two albums just decided, I fucking

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:35.920
love.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.920
He's into it.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.920
He's into it.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:38.920
Yeah.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.880
He's fallen for this Americanist, I guess maybe found out that she was dating a cop

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.880
or something.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.880
Oh, that could be.

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:45.880
I don't know.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.640
I don't know exactly what it is, but it is really weird.

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.200
Is that what we should be doing?

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:55.840
Should we, should the, should Antifa focus more on biplanes and crop dusting mind control

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.600
over a resort towns?

01:04:58.600 --> 01:04:59.600
I don't know.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.600
I think that's a good idea.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:05.400
I listened to this, this chemtrails over the country club song and I don't know.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:09.680
I still like Lana Del Rey enough, but I think I might be a little bored.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:14.440
It's not, there were a couple of good songs on Norman fucking Rockwell, but like as a

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:20.040
whole, I thought that song was really kind of just standard Lana Del Rey stuff.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:23.240
It didn't do anything that really intrigued me much.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:27.440
It kind of felt a little bit, a little safe, a little down the middle.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:33.080
Is this alphabetically the sequel to Bombs Over Baghdad?

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.080
Yes.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.080
Okay.

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.080
Moving on.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:46.600
So Alex interviews Larry Pinckney, uh, it was a Black Panther back in the day and they,

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:47.600
it's nonsense.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:52.720
It's more just about how the FBI is running Antifa and Black Lives Matter and stuff.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.320
But then Alex gets back to talking about Roger's wife and this is the next day now.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.320
This is the 15th.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.800
He's still talking about Roger's wife.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.800
Already had a clarification.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:06.960
Roger Stone's wife got beat up, didn't actually happen on Thursday, the day before his wife

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.960
didn't want to tell him.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.660
The guy ran her over with a bike in her front yard.

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:14.960
She got up, he pushed her down two more times and she knew that Roger would go crazy.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.960
So she just said, a guy hit me with a bike.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:19.000
Then she had to go to the hospital the next day and then she told him the rest of the

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
story that he told me.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
And he's so upset.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.720
He can't even come on the air and she's going to have an emergency surgery probably today.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:28.480
So that's a 74 year old wife and then they got beat her up.

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.480
Okay.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.480
So, and they're trying to get Roger to go crazy.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.760
I mean, I understand that that's what's happening here and they did that to Larry Pinckney and

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:34.760
others.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.040
Uh, I need your support.

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.760
I appreciate your support.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.760
Wow.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:43.960
Alex, you can make up shit about my wife, but I'm not going on your show to lie.

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:49.200
And please just whatever you do, don't use, uh, fabricated stories about my wife to sell

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.200
pills.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.200
Oh wait, you did?

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.200
Oh, how predictable.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:57.720
I think that's just, if you meet Alex and talk to him for more than an hour, you have

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:00.960
to sign a waiver that says he's allowed to lie about your time together.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.720
You're probably, you're probably right.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:08.440
It's like a, like an NDA, but I'm going to lie about this.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:13.360
So Alex has another guest on and it's Steve Quayle, who is a noted weirdo.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:18.240
He is someone who has, uh, he has a long history with Alex and shows like Coast to Coast.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.560
He's also a guest on Jim Baker's show.

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.120
He's vice president for a while.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.320
He's written books about giants.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.320
Sure.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.320
Sure.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:30.680
Apparently there's another book coming out soon about giants that Alex wants to not talk

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:31.680
about.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.680
The Nephilim?

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.680
Is that what we're talking about?

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:34.680
We're talking about those giants.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:35.680
We're talking Bible giants.

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.040
We're not talking giants.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.080
We're not talking about, uh, centers in the NBA.

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.920
No, we're talking young earth creationism giants.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:47.640
We're talking about, uh, the angels who fell and breaded with human women.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.640
Good stuff.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.640
Got too big.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.640
Yep.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.640
Got too big, Dan.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:57.720
Alex, in the past, when we've listened to episodes from like the 2009 era around, then

01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:01.160
Steve Quayle is around a bit more and Alex always talks about like how he's a prophet

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.360
and like he knows stuff ahead, man.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.040
He's just really right about stuff.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.960
So Alex asks him how he knows the stuff that he knows.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.960
I'm interested in finding out.

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:14.600
I don't know if you could predict this and it's not a good answer.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.080
My testimony is simply this.

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.600
I went from the gunner most, the uttermost.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.080
I was a president of attorney.

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.080
This is important.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.000
Oh, that was wild on Montana state university.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.520
I went to how Lindsay talking about Jesus, never knew about Jesus, never knew anything.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.800
And I accepted Jesus in my heart.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.040
I went home that night.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:35.720
I was living in my mother's house and uh, Tim, Tim blocks from the university and Jesus

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:39.460
literally, and I know this is going to flip, flip people out, but he literally appeared

01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:40.460
to me.

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:41.640
I fell on my face.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:45.120
He gave me a panorama of history and told me he was calling me.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.320
Now understand, I just found out who Jesus was the day that that spirit of God convicted

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.320
my heart.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.320
But here's the thing.

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.000
He gave me a panorama of history.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.520
I saw it in the future.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.980
Just imagine a motion picture and then he gave me a statement.

01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:05.040
He says, Steve, I am going to hide the things from you until they're shortly to come to

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.040
pass.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:10.320
And he told me, he said, I want you to prepare my people for the end of the age.

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.820
I'll bring people that know to tell you what you need to know, but you must be faithful

01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:15.820
to warn them.

01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:16.820
Alex.

01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:17.820
That's true.

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:19.000
From that and that launched me.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.120
Oh boy.

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.400
You are such a good medium.

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.720
You do not need to do voices.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:28.800
I, uh, the reason that you don't know things is because I'm going to hide them from you

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:35.120
and tell, uh, I have appeared to you Jesus from beyond the grave and I shall give you

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.760
convenient excuses for why I am not explaining things to you.

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.840
Also if, uh, you know, the Lord came down and gave Steve a panoramic view of history,

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:48.680
you should probably explain to Alex that Hitler wasn't elected president before the Reich

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:49.680
Tech fire.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.960
You know, Jesus did left out that part for some odd reason.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.960
Now everything's in the panorama.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.880
He should know everything about history.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:02.480
But if you're seeing a panoramic view of history, uh, one, that's a lot to take in.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.480
Sure.

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:04.480
How long was he there for?

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.840
I mean, a day to God is a thousand years.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.840
Totally.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.720
But like, if you are there, like if we had some academics.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.720
By the way, by the way, I'm not quoting scripture.

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:16.840
I'm remembering that because it's the name of a RZA song.

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:21.320
Oh, the places that you learn.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.320
Sure.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.320
We see through a glass darkly.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.320
Indeed.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.920
None of us have the full picture, but the RZA has a clearer picture than the rest of

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:27.920
us.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:28.920
That's true.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:29.920
Yeah.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:36.720
So Steve talked to God who gave him a panoramic view of history and told him that he was going

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.200
to lead God's people or something.

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.840
Now Alex had a different visitation.

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:42.840
Sure.

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.320
You see, you got a visit from Jesus.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.160
I got a visit from the other guy.

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.640
So why did you get a visit from the Jesus?

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.640
I got a visit from the devil.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:56.000
Because I was serving the devil wholehearted and somebody somewhere touched God for me

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.200
because I was totally beyond.

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.120
You're wiser than I am anyway.

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.920
So why did I get a visit from the devil, which I'm not going to get into on air, but I got

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:06.680
the other visit because I was pretty, I love God actually, but I got a visit from the other

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:07.680
guy.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.600
Well, listen, you only get a visit from the devil.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.480
Even Jesus was tempted by the devil.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:17.680
I'm not saying either one of us are Jesus, but I think it's really important, Alex, that

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.200
people understand something.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.800
This is a spiritual war.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.800
I don't know.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:28.400
I feel like everybody who's ever been interested in Alex Jones, again, should lead all their

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:33.680
stories with Alex Jones, comma, guy who believes the devil visited him.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:34.680
Yeah.

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:35.680
Yeah.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.600
I just have a heart to, I want to know the rules of this universe.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.240
It's really getting annoying.

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.000
It's like whenever, it's like when you're watching a superhero movie and then at the

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.600
deus ex machina, somebody already, all of a sudden has a new power.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:48.920
I'm annoyed by that.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:49.920
It's like heroes.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.920
Yeah.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.200
Set up the rules for me, exist within the rules of space.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:57.400
When they started to get to the point where they could give people powers and heroes,

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.400
it's just like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.400
Come on.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.400
We can't do this anymore.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.400
No.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.400
What's going on with that eclipse?

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:04.400
We can't do this.

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:05.400
We can't do this.

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:09.400
We can't just, everybody's claiming that they got visits from superpowers and shit.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.520
No, come on man.

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.920
I got visited by Hephaestus.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.520
No, no, no.

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.520
You don't get it.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.720
The god, the blacksmith god.

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:20.040
See, it's actually proof that you're a good person that you got visited by the devil and

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.520
that I was a bad person that I got visited by Jesus.

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.500
You see how it works, man?

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:27.320
It's like yin and yang, but we don't believe in that bullshit.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.320
Yeah.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.320
Great.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:32.600
So that's the kind of conversation that's taken place.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.400
Yeah, I believe that.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:39.360
And I've been listening to this and I'm thinking to myself, boy, this show is dumb.

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.720
This is really dumb.

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.720
Yeah.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.720
Oh boy.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:47.280
So Steve's got a prediction that has nothing to do with giants or visitations from other

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.280
worlds.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:51.320
And I want to make this statement.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:58.180
Seven years ago, before President Trump even obviously became president, I made this statement.

01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:04.280
Before God allows China and Russia to destroy the United States in a nuclear attack, he's

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:08.080
going to reveal the sins of the leaders to the people and the people's sins before a

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.080
holy God.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.080
Cool.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.280
Everybody has watched the narrative, some of the sickest SOBs on the planet.

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:18.000
Those are sons of Belial, meaning Baal.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
We've seen it.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.480
We're seeing the deep state.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.720
So I guess get a bunker?

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.840
I prefer the Silquarian Belial.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:26.840
Thank you very much.

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:27.840
Yeah.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.840
I don't know.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:29.840
I guess China and Russia are going to nuke us.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.840
Yeah.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:31.840
Why?

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.840
I don't know.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:33.840
Aren't they heavily invested in us?

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:34.840
Yeah.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:35.840
I think they want us to live.

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:36.840
Yeah.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:37.840
Yeah.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:38.840
Anyway.

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:39.840
Huh.

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:40.840
Weird.

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.560
Steve is an insufferably annoying weirdo.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.320
No, he's doing great.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.080
I love him seven years.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.080
He's had visions.

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:52.920
Listen, if I want to just hear somebody talk about being visited by God and how Belial

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:55.520
is going to nuke the earth or whatever the fuck.

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.800
I could call my wife.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.040
No, I'm fine with that.

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.280
I'll listen to that.

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.280
Sure.

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.960
I'll listen to that same person tell me about Antifa.

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.840
Well, there's probably that.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.680
I'm just not playing that game.

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.600
Anyway, we go on to the 16th and that's Saturday.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.600
Okay.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.600
What?

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:13.600
Alex has an episode on Saturday?

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:14.600
That must be an emergency episode.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:15.600
Emergency.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.600
Emergency episode.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.520
I think Alex has had a little bit of time to think.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.520
Uh huh.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.720
We got a new reason that the 6th happened.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.720
There will be another reason.

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.720
Gotcha.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.120
But that doesn't come until actually Sunday.

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.120
Okay.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:30.000
But on Saturday, Alex has had some time to think after that Steve interview.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.500
I think he might not be feeling good about it.

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:41.400
We all know the false flag is the scoundrel's ace in the hole.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:45.040
They're ace of spades.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.240
And now they've played it.

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.560
Why isn't good governance ever their ace of spades?

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:51.080
And it gives me a just surreal feeling.

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.360
Has anybody tried that?

01:14:52.360 --> 01:15:01.200
To have walked right into it.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:04.080
And then to have Steve Pacinek on a few days ago.

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:10.840
Chortling and celebrating that fact.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.000
But not in the way he said.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.800
It's a little bit different.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.600
But see that's the thing about the globalist mindset.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:26.520
As the terrain changes and they flip sides and engage in Machiavellian behavior.

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:29.180
They think that's intelligence.

01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:41.400
They think the cold, hard, social, Darwinistic way they carry it out is proof of their righteousness

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.600
and it's not.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:46.680
So that seems to imply that Steve is a globalist.

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.680
Yeah.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:53.640
I, what's going on here, and this will sort of play out as the episode goes along.

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:57.520
Alex is saying that Steve was chortling but not in the way he seems.

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:02.440
The way he seemed to be chortling was that Trump had won and everything was totally fine.

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:06.440
The way he was actually chortling was at Alex's expense.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:12.040
Now it should be pointed out that our episode mocking the shit out of Steve's interview

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:16.600
with him came out on Friday, this is Saturday.

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:21.400
So I don't know if maybe, I don't know if that's what led to this emergency episode

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.280
of Reflection.

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:24.280
Probably not.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.280
I would doubt it.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.120
But Alex is kind of realizing that Steve is fucking with him.

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:36.520
He is talking about 1984 and about how Emanuel Goldstein is a set up, it's QAnon.

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:43.840
And then he starts talking about other characters in 1984 and how they interacted.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.880
When their torturers came in to torture them, they thought that they were actually their

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.880
friends because they couldn't believe they'd been conned.

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:58.600
Just like in 1984, O'Brien, and it's all just a fictional account of this, is torturing

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.240
him to death.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:03.880
But he still thinks O'Brien's a good guy and he's like, oh, O'Brien, they got you.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:07.440
When O'Brien comes in his jail cell, he goes, O'Brien, they got you.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.440
They got you too.

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:12.320
And he goes, oh, they got me a long time ago, Winston.

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:17.680
See, the difference is with somebody like me, I know Paciniks and O'Brien type.

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.320
I'm just observing him and watching him.

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:20.320
I'm not Winston Smith.

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:21.320
Oh, boy.

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.320
Oh, boy.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.320
Oh, boy.

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:24.320
Okay.

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.560
I'm not getting manipulated.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.640
I am the master manipulator.

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.280
I am observing him as in a science experiment.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.280
Yeah, you are.

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:39.080
Sure, I've been doing this for 20 years and the fact that he's complimented me has allowed

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:42.080
him to say whatever bullshit that he wants to.

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:44.640
But I was observing.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:47.200
I was keeping a close eye on that sneaky O'Brien.

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:51.160
Keep your friends close and keep your enemies closer, Dan.

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.160
Yeah.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.160
Oh, boy.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.840
Ooh, this is sad.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:59.480
I am glad I'm not a narcissist and this would really, you know what, it would really fuck

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:04.880
me up for a good day or two, you know, but I wouldn't need to create a mythology around

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.880
it.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:10.560
I'd be like, I got had and I would learn from it and I would move on with my life and then

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.160
I can't do it.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.160
And then you would bring up the Nigerian email scam.

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.160
Totally.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:16.160
Repeatedly on air as a metaphor.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.160
Exactly.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.160
I'd be like, this has happened before.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.160
Yeah.

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:20.160
Yeah.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.280
So Alex is still talking about 1984 and he gets into talking more about this Emanuel

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:24.280
Goldstein character.

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:25.280
Here it is.

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.280
Emanuel Goldstein.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:34.840
Emanuel Goldstein is a fictional character in George Orwell's 1949 dystopian novel, 1984.

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:40.120
He is the principal enemy of the state according to the party of the totalitarian Oceania.

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.880
So he's just reading the Wikipedia page for Emanuel Goldstein.

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.040
Did they print it out or?

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.040
I'm not sure.

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.040
I wasn't watching the video.

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.040
All right.

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:53.040
But the reason that he pauses there when he says the 1949 novel is because on the Wikipedia

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:57.200
page it inaccurately says the 1984 novel, 1984.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.480
They have the year wrong.

01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.480
Right.

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:01.200
So Alex was correcting that as he was reading.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.200
Sure, sure, sure.

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.760
He hasn't read this and it's just a Wikipedia page.

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:07.360
I have no interest in his analysis of 1984.

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:08.880
Uh, no.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:15.880
Anyway, he's, he's, he's bummed out cause you know, on the one hand they got false flagged

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:16.880
and he's pissed off about that.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:17.880
No they didn't.

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:19.000
Well, according to him they have.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Sure.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.480
And he's experiencing that tough.

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:25.160
Um, and you know, Biden's gonna be president.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.960
It's it's tough times all around for the Patriots.

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:28.960
Yeah, sure.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:31.240
And there's literally only one solution.

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:33.460
Thank you so much for joining us on this Saturday evening.

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:38.680
The only way we stop this globalist operation and foil their storm, storm busters, is by

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:43.240
you taking this live feed and the archive feed for band out video and telling everyone

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:47.400
that they've got a martial law plan for the next few days and that only getting the word

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:48.400
out can stop it.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.520
We need this report to get 10 million views by Monday.

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:57.160
Hit your email list, hit your text message list, tell your neighbors to watch it, run

01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:00.060
down the street with a sign saying, watch it.

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:04.500
The productive solution is just get me free publicity.

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:05.500
It's dumb.

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:06.500
Man, brutal.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:07.500
Yeah.

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:08.500
It's brutal.

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:09.500
Mike Adams is back.

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:10.500
Great.

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:11.500
Yeah.

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:12.500
For an emergency episode.

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:13.500
Yep.

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:14.500
All right.

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:15.500
So we're going to be told how we're going to die?

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:16.500
Yeah.

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:17.500
Okay.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.800
Uh, oh my God.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:23.080
It's very easy to know why Mike Adams is on an emergency episode.

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:27.160
Mike Adams is so goddamn dramatic.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:30.160
Yeah.

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:34.680
The owner of It's Over for Humanity There Will Only Be Lone Survivors is dramatic.

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:36.580
He's like a junior high student.

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:39.240
This guy is going through some things.

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:42.040
He's the dark end wizard writing poetry all day.

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.040
Yeah.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:46.600
It's behavior unbecoming of an adult the way he acts.

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.600
It's maudlin.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:48.800
It's over the top.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.840
It's just not cool.

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:53.360
It's like how you imagine Edgar Allen Poe in high school.

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.200
You're like, Jesus, that guy must've been exhausted.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.200
I think more annoying, probably.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:58.200
Probably.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:59.200
There's a smaller head.

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:00.200
There's artistic craft.

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:01.200
That's true.

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.600
Edgar Allen Poe brought to the table.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:06.560
So Mike wants to explain why there's so many troops in DC.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:09.200
Now my argument would be that a bunch of people stormed the capital.

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.200
I don't understand.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:16.640
And, uh, you know, there's existing threats and, uh, you know, continuing people saying

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:17.640
they want to do it again.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:21.800
No, I'm pretty sure that the Patreons are universally non-violent, Dan.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:22.800
That's what I've heard from them.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.800
Well, it turns out there's a whole other explanation for these troops.

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:26.800
Oh, interesting.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:27.800
30,000 troops.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:32.000
Now, remember in Afghanistan, we only have about 3,000 troops, American troops there.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.260
So this is 10 times the size of an invasion force.

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:38.840
This is using a cannon to kill a fly.

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:39.840
Right.

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:43.180
So the explanation that this is just for the inauguration is complete nonsense.

01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:44.480
There's something else happening.

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:50.120
I've been sent photos of Patriot missile banks being set up, uh, in other States in America.

01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:55.800
And as you know, there, there is legitimate concern about, uh, Chinese troops in Canada,

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.000
uh, Chinese troops in Mexico.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.080
This is just Q shit, man.

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:05.640
Intimate concern about Chinese troops in Mexico does not sound like something I, uh, I believe.

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:10.040
I don't know why there would be an amassing of troops in Washington, DC if it was in the

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:13.840
Mexican border, but, uh, uh, you know, I don't know.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.840
This is just dumb.

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.080
Yeah, that does sound dumb.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.080
So Mike.

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.720
I would argue also one of the reasons there are so many more troops is just because it's

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:21.400
easier to get there.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.580
You know how hard it is to get 30,000 troops to Afghanistan?

01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:26.080
That's a long way away.

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:29.160
And hasn't Trump been scaling back the number of troops?

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.160
They're more available.

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:34.040
Isn't that part of Alex and Mike's narratives?

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.400
So you shouldn't use that as the number.

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:37.400
No.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.400
Anyway, who cares?

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:43.280
Um, Mike has evidence of somebody who's saying that Trump is going to win.

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.680
Uh, they're a CIA shill.

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:49.520
I think he's talking about Steve Pacino.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.640
I don't know though, because he won't make names.

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:58.400
There are some bad faith actors that, uh, even in the last 24 hours, I was able to...

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:01.560
Confirm a particular bad faith actor.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:05.000
I don't want to mention any names, but someone who had fooled a lot of people with online

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.540
videos that were popular saying that, no, Trump's going to be sworn in on the 20th.

01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:12.600
That person is a CIA operative.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:17.380
I've been able to acquire his ID number working at the CIA.

01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:18.880
So that's an op.

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:25.080
If you had evidence that somebody was running operations and you had definitive proof they

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:28.280
worked for the CIA, like you would put that out.

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.520
You would have to put that out.

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:33.160
You'd have to think that like, it's probably dangerous for me to have the, I mean, that's

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:34.520
what Alex would say, right?

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:35.520
That's what Alex says all the time.

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.720
If you have this information, you have to get it all out.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:38.720
Yeah.

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:39.720
Otherwise you're dead.

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.720
Yeah.

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.720
Yeah.

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:42.720
I mean, isn't that, isn't this the Mission Impossible?

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:48.000
If you identify an undercover operative, that's the biggest thing that will get you killed

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.560
until you release that information.

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:50.560
Yeah.

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.560
That's the whole movie.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:54.400
The only thing that can protect you is coming out with that information.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.400
Exactly.

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:56.400
Yeah.

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.400
So I think this is about Steve.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.400
Yeah.

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:03.200
Anyway, uh, we have some pretty serious things on the horizon.

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:04.200
Sure.

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:07.960
There's possible Chinese invasions, uh, also another threat to consider.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.960
Okay.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:14.440
I'm very, very concerned that the deep state is going to set off a dirty bomb in a US city.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:15.440
Sure.

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:16.640
And they're going to blame that on Patriots.

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:20.680
And that's why they're desperately knocking on doors looking for somebody to recruit.

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:25.520
Somebody who actually has a history of appearing on videos and podcasts and so on talking about

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.760
guns or Trump or what have you.

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:28.760
You?

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:29.760
Yeah.

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:30.760
Yep.

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.080
All of this stuff is you.

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.500
You realize this is you.

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:34.760
Are you speaking to a mirror?

01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:39.920
Are you threatening to dirty bomb me?

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.200
I am, I am loving all of these.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.560
I'm concerned about what they're going to say the Patriots do because part of me is

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:51.560
like, do you guys think the Patriots are capable of building a dirty bomb?

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:52.680
Cause that concerns me.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.000
I think they definitely are.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.680
I mean, what's that Oathkeeper guy who was arrested a couple of years back with a napalm

01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:58.680
bomb.

01:24:58.680 --> 01:24:59.680
Yeah.

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:00.680
Yeah.

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:03.440
I think, uh, I think what we're all really hearing from these people is, Oh my God, I'm

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.840
worried about what we created.

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:05.840
Yeah.

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:06.840
It might be out of control.

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:13.640
This, uh, uh, you know, this thing is an uncontrollable, completely out of line group that we thought

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.320
would just be fun.

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:16.320
Yeah.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.700
Unfortunately all of our fanfic about history didn't warn us about what real history would

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:24.080
have warned us about an uncontrollable mob.

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.600
I think it's kind of like me starting the year of the seltzer.

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.600
Sure.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:29.600
I thought it would be good fun.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.600
Right.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:34.920
And I thought that, you know, we'd just have seltzers and I'd try them and it got out of

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:35.920
hand.

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:40.280
You picked a, you went 500 is too big and a year is too long.

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.280
Yeah.

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.280
It's an unwieldy amount of time.

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:45.040
It's an unwieldy amount of seltzer and requires commitment.

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.560
I had it for a long time.

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.160
I'm not saying it's over.

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.240
We still got the fiscal year's end.

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:53.880
I created something that I thought was fun and it was fun.

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:54.880
It was a lot of fun.

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:56.520
They had a lot of momentum for a while.

01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:57.520
It was great.

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.520
But it was uncontrollable.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.680
Flagged a little bit and then it came back.

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:01.680
It's still back.

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:02.680
It's still back.

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:03.680
It's uncontrollable.

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:04.680
Let's say you can't just force it.

01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:05.680
Yeah.

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:10.560
This metaphor doesn't work, but, uh, neither does democracy, apparently, because Mike has

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:12.760
to tell you the country has fallen.

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.160
This guy is so dramatic.

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.160
Sure.

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:18.400
Well, the rule of law has collapsed in this nation and whether you're arrested just depends

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.680
on which side you're working for.

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:25.080
So, uh, if you're, if you're a pro-Trump patriot, you're going to be considered guilty no matter

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.180
what you're doing.

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:29.660
If you're a radical leftist, you can throw Molotov cocktails and set fire to federal

01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:32.980
buildings and burn police cars and shine lasers at federal agents.

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:33.980
In your mythology.

01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:37.620
Or you'll be arrested and the charges will be dropped within 24 hours by a George Soros

01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:40.700
funded district attorney in your local city.

01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:44.340
So we have now entered the era of complete lawlessness.

01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:49.820
There is no controlling legal authority that is legitimate in this nation, which means

01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:52.120
the constitutional republic has fallen.

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:53.120
Damn.

01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:54.120
Wow.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.120
That happened.

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.120
Yeah.

01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.120
Wow.

01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:58.120
Big news.

01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:59.120
Yeah.

01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.120
That's a real bummer.

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.120
Huge if true.

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:02.120
Yeah.

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.120
I love all the...

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:05.120
There is no legitimate legal authority in America anymore.

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:07.800
Well, I mean, I guess that would mean it's game on, right?

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:12.420
I mean, all the things that would stop you from doing things like storming the Capitol,

01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:13.420
that would be laws.

01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:14.420
Yeah.

01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:15.420
And there's no legitimate legal authority.

01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:16.420
And the constitutional republic has fallen.

01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:17.420
Wow.

01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:18.420
I mean, I guess the...

01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:19.740
Do what thou wilt, if you will.

01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.660
As Mike is saying, smoke them if you got them.

01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:22.660
Yeah.

01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:23.660
Yeah.

01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:24.660
Yeah.

01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:25.660
It does feel like that.

01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:31.500
It reminds me so much of all those 2021 articles where it's like, cops have been proven to

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:35.780
hurt leftists at three times the rate of white nationalists.

01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:43.400
And it's like, guys, I'm glad that you have new hard data, but come on, this is America.

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:47.440
We didn't need a new Guardian article in 2021.

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:51.980
We had Guardian articles in 1914 saying the exact same thing.

01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:52.980
All right.

01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:53.980
But it's good to have more articles.

01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:54.980
Sure.

01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:58.540
But you could have just put up a picture of the flag and been like, see, this is what

01:27:58.540 --> 01:27:59.540
we do.

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:00.540
Fair enough.

01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:07.700
Now, one thing you're not going to see an article about is the evil eye.

01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:10.380
I don't think that's true.

01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:14.420
I once saw a documentary about this guy who actually had magical powers.

01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:17.180
He could hypnotize people with his evil eye.

01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:18.500
With his evil eye.

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:19.500
Yeah.

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:20.900
He was like a really rich dude.

01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:22.620
Was it narrated by Vincent Price?

01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:24.500
No, it was this really rich guy.

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.380
He had a great mustache.

01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:27.380
I think...

01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.380
Mesmer?

01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:34.260
I remember that one of his employees was a guy who would watch films and then review

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:37.420
them poorly.

01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:41.220
That guy who was the film reviewer, his son went to the UN school.

01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:43.220
Oh, that's strange.

01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:46.660
Dr. Demento?

01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:49.100
Please tell me that you know what I'm talking about.

01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:50.100
No clue.

01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:51.100
The critic.

01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:52.100
Was that the critic?

01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:53.100
Yeah.

01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:54.100
Duke Phillips.

01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:55.100
Oh, man.

01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:56.100
He could hypnotize people with his evil eye.

01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:57.100
You were referencing Duke Phillips.

01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:58.100
I forgot about the evil eye.

01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:59.100
Oh, shit.

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:00.460
Look into my evil eye.

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:01.460
That's right.

01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:02.460
He could do that.

01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:03.460
I should have said something about the...

01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:04.460
He had country bears.

01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:07.460
Yeah, that's what I would have...if you'd said he has the country bears.

01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:09.620
We're the bears who sing for Duke.

01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:11.460
So, yeah.

01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:12.460
Evil eye.

01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:13.460
Yes.

01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:14.460
Apparently is a real thing.

01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:17.860
I don't want to have a George W. Bush moment with you where he said, you know, I think

01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:18.860
Putin's a good guy.

01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:19.860
I looked in his eyes.

01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:22.820
He has a soul I can trust, but everybody knows it's the eyes.

01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:24.660
Everybody knows it's the wind of the soul.

01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:30.480
I look at your eyes and I see a serious, intelligent, focused person that's really concerned.

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:33.580
You look at my eyes, you basically see the same thing.

01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:39.300
I look at the eyes and it's increasingly worse at the grocery store or in public.

01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:43.300
And I'm seeing more and more agitated, crazy looking people that look like schizophrenics

01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:44.540
or demons.

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:48.940
And let's just put a photo up of a composite of some of the Democrat leaders' eyes.

01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:51.340
And folks, it's not like we're cherry picking photos.

01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:56.220
It's every photo of them, they look like they are from another dimension.

01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:57.220
Back this out.

01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:59.620
I mean, I've met some of these people.

01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:02.100
I've been in rooms with these people.

01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:05.380
And what is it about the eyes?

01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:06.380
What is going on?

01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:13.020
I know you study the medical issues, the 5G, the GMO, all of it.

01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:18.900
But what is causing people to look like this and to act like this?

01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:19.900
Medical weed.

01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:21.140
In this case, it's not a medical issue.

01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:22.180
It's a spiritual issue.

01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:24.780
They are demonically infested.

01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:25.780
That's no joke.

01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:27.180
It's not an exaggeration.

01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:32.980
There are actual demon or demonic entities that are possessing these people.

01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:37.740
And then what happens is the body, the physical body begins to mirror the internal dark spirit

01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:38.740
structure.

01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:40.460
This is the health ranger.

01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:48.380
If you don't understand what led to the situation on the 6th that you created and fucking caused,

01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:51.100
this is what you would say.

01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:56.380
Your political enemies are literally demon possessed and the constitutional republic

01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:58.060
has fallen.

01:30:58.060 --> 01:30:59.060
You are not fighting-

01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.900
It's not responsible rhetoric.

01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:01.900
Bananas.

01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:02.900
Bananas.

01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:03.900
Bananas.

01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:08.420
I just think it's funny that this guy runs a natural news alternative medicine site and

01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:11.860
he's sitting here on air talking about how people's eyes can tell you if there are demons

01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:13.500
inside them.

01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:15.060
That's another thing.

01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:17.500
Lead every article about Mike Adams with this.

01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:21.460
Mike Adams, who believes you can see demons in eyes.

01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:22.460
I'd hate for him to look at me.

01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:23.460
I have a cross eye.

01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:24.460
What would he think about me?

01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:25.460
Oh, you're a demon.

01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:27.260
I obviously would say something terrible about me.

01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:28.820
I mean, the cross eye is the sign of the demon.

01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:30.860
I was born this way.

01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:31.860
With a demon.

01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:32.860
Oh.

01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:33.860
Sorry.

01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:37.860
So dumb.

01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:38.860
These people are stupid.

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:42.680
So anyway, Alex starts talking about Steve and I would say that he describes Steve kind

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:45.580
of like how you might describe a lunatic.

01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:46.860
Let's talk about Steve Pacinek here.

01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:48.980
I've been interviewing him for 19 years.

01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:50.140
He is a big spook.

01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:54.660
He was involved in a lot of incredible stuff and he did help write Tom Clancy's novels

01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:58.980
and he has that twisted side where he laughs at you and says, you know, oh, we co-opted

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:02.660
you and he exaggerates and, you know, does all that condescending stuff.

01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:06.780
But he's an interesting guy, so I have him on, but he's done a lot of good things.

01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:09.900
Exposing 9-11 as an inside job and wow.

01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:13.460
All right.

01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:15.860
You fired David Knight.

01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:17.740
Jesus.

01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:19.620
You dumb motherfucker.

01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:23.460
It hasn't even been that long since he fired him.

01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:24.900
Really has not.

01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:27.140
It really has not.

01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:29.940
It's such a great turnaround too.

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:31.340
So fast.

01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:36.740
It's like if David Knight was like a goddamn Twilight Zone twist.

01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:41.780
If David Knight wasn't so boring, like this could be a huge boost to his career.

01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:42.780
Totally.

01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:49.060
No, his credibility would go off the charts if anyone were still listening.

01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:54.620
I did actually listen to a video of David Knight talking about Steve after, I believe

01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:59.340
it was after the 6th, and I was like, man, scathing stuff.

01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:00.340
So boring.

01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:01.340
Yeah.

01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:02.340
Couldn't even get any clips from it.

01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:03.340
No.

01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:05.460
But he does say that Alex fired him because of Steve.

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:06.460
Well, yeah.

01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:10.980
And he says that Alex doesn't care about anything except traffic to the site.

01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:11.980
Well, yeah.

01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:12.980
Well, yeah.

01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:13.980
Damn.

01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:14.980
Coming with them boring swings.

01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:16.980
Jesus, David Knight.

01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:19.380
Thanks for speaking obvious to power.

01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:24.700
So Mike and Alex get to wrestling with the idea that Steve made this bet about the election

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:28.500
and like how if he's wrong, it doesn't matter because then he can never come back on the

01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:29.500
show again.

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:35.740
This is fucking 1910s people discussing like, well, if she is a witch, then unfortunately

01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:36.840
we're going to have to burn her.

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:37.840
But we don't know yet.

01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:39.820
You got to look her in the eye.

01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:44.220
What Pacenik was promising you, what I noticed about that, he made a bet with you and you

01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:47.900
were going to offer to employ him if he's right and he was going to offer to never come

01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:48.900
on your show again.

01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:49.900
If he's wrong.

01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:54.020
Well, there's no downside for him to offer that because this is this.

01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:56.420
If he's if he's playing us, it's his final play.

01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:57.660
He will never want to come on your show.

01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:00.960
He was laughing at me and was very obvious that was the final play.

01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:02.700
But I knew weeks ago that's what he was doing.

01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:04.260
I know I predict it's the final play.

01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:05.260
That's why you fired David.

01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:10.100
And I'm going to demand he come back on whenever what he said doesn't come true.

01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:11.100
Yeah.

01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:14.540
You know, if Biden's sworn in, he can he can just say no and what are you going to do?

01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:16.260
You know, go find them and put them on camera.

01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:17.260
No, no shit.

01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:18.260
Yeah, no shit.

01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:19.260
Why?

01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:21.820
By the way, it's not the final play.

01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:24.220
Steve will be back in like a couple of course.

01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:25.220
Pretend this didn't happen.

01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:26.220
It didn't.

01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:27.980
I've done this rodeo too many times.

01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:28.980
No kidding.

01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:32.660
I guess this is a little more severe than other times, though, because like, it's clear

01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:34.140
Alex's feelings are hurt.

01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:35.140
Oh, severely.

01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:36.860
But he's hurt Alex's feelings in the past.

01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:37.860
Sure.

01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:40.380
I just haven't heard him be like, I've been using you, man.

01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:41.380
I know.

01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:42.380
That one's too good.

01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:43.380
That was great.

01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:44.380
That was just too good.

01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:45.380
Mm hmm.

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:46.660
That eclipses four stars for sure.

01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:47.660
Yep.

01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:48.660
Yep.

01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:49.660
Not as pithy, though.

01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:50.660
Not as much of a soundbite.

01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:51.660
No, that's true.

01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:52.660
That's true.

01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:55.260
So Mike is worried about a dirty bomb, worried about Chinese invasion.

01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:56.260
Sure.

01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:58.060
And he also is worried about anyone going to protest.

01:34:58.060 --> 01:34:59.060
OK.

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:00.060
Don't do it.

01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:01.060
All right.

01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:04.380
To everyone listening, do not participate in any of these capital protests.

01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:08.780
Not that there are really any actually being organized by patriot groups, but don't participate

01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:09.780
in those.

01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:13.180
If you go to the capital, this is all false flag operation you're being set up.

01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:17.700
What you can do is legally and lawfully prepare to defend your home, your family and your

01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:22.780
local neighborhood or community against any kind of aggression that may that may happen

01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:27.500
if the left believes they can carry out a local uprising and go door to door killing

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:30.580
people like what happened in the Cultural Revolution in China.

01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:32.060
And that's a very real possibility.

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:33.660
This guy is so dramatic.

01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:36.020
This is this is painful to listen to.

01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:37.620
Do these people not hear themselves?

01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:39.660
Like I know they don't care about words.

01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:44.460
I know they don't care about the words that they say, but I cannot imagine listening to

01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:49.300
somebody who tells me that my political enemies are literal demons.

01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:54.140
And then in the same breath tells me that I shouldn't protest.

01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:58.260
Don't do anything but barricade your doors.

01:35:58.260 --> 01:35:59.820
Don't do the protesting because that's a trap.

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:04.260
But you should be ready to kill people who are coming door to door totally to kill conservatives.

01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:09.540
I mean, we are going to have a dearth of Jehovah's Witnesses if they go to the south.

01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:10.860
Oh, no, I wouldn't do it.

01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:14.420
So Alex is worried about migration.

01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:16.900
He's worried about immigrants coming in.

01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:21.140
I can't believe we can just change topics to immigration right now.

01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:22.620
He has an interesting theory.

01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:27.260
By interesting, I mean, absurd and probably motivated by racism.

01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:29.600
You look at Europe and the model they want here.

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:34.280
Every home they say is going to take a African or Middle Eastern migrant, then that's a spy

01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:38.760
on your house that works for the U.N. so they can do whatever they want and further break

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:39.760
down your home.

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:43.060
I mean, this is literally the takeover of civilization.

01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:44.060
That's messed up.

01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:48.820
I don't know why you would assume that any immigrant that you allow and agree to have

01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:54.020
in your home out of the charity of your own heart would be a U.N. spy.

01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:55.020
Yeah.

01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:56.020
Cool.

01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:01.840
You could just say, OK, well, first off, you could say no to this, I imagine.

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:08.720
But second, if you do have somebody in your home, don't they know how insanely hostile

01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:10.220
you are towards them?

01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:13.460
Wouldn't they have some idea?

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:18.380
Or even the government who's like, OK, we're going to put you in all of these homes, one

01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:21.300
per home, but not this one.

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:24.180
Those people are going to kill you.

01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:25.180
Yeah.

01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:27.420
It doesn't seem like it's in anyone's best interest.

01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:28.420
No, it's not.

01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:29.420
Yeah.

01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:34.540
It's a paranoid fantasy of white nationalist types like Alex, and that's all.

01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:35.700
They're U.N. spies, though.

01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:39.580
Yeah, we can't quarter soldiers in our homes, God damn it.

01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:40.580
Keep that in mind.

01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:41.580
Oh, of course.

01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:42.580
Because that might come back.

01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:43.580
Naturally.

01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:46.940
So Alex was sort of going down this path, but he gets distracted by thinking about Steve

01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:47.940
again.

01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:49.300
He doesn't like that Steve-

01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:50.300
He really hurt his feelings.

01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:51.820
Yeah, because Steve was laughing at it.

01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:52.820
Yeah.

01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:56.340
So we'll track this together in what could be the final shows.

01:37:56.340 --> 01:38:01.260
I mean, you heard Mike, like you said, this could be your last time coming on.

01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:04.740
Steve Quayle said that, but notice Pacenik thought it was funny about, oh, yeah, just

01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:05.740
don't worry.

01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:11.260
I won't be coming back on your show probably again, ha ha ha ha, because, you know, very

01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:15.700
maniacal or because I don't think he's delusional.

01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:20.280
And I think he knows something really, really big is coming up here.

01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:24.660
And then he wants to just put that last laugh in of, oh, and by the way, Jones, thanks for

01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:27.260
helping us get martial law with what happened to the Capitol.

01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:31.260
I think that Steve was laughing at Alex, but I think he's also delusional.

01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:32.260
Yeah.

01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:33.260
The problem with the way that-

01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:34.260
They're not exclusive.

01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:35.260
No.

01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:36.260
But they are for someone like Alex.

01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:37.260
That's true.

01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:42.060
Because he's built up Steve over the years far too much to sort of penetrate the facade

01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:46.020
of like the fake version of him that he's presented to the audience, which is really

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:50.620
easy for someone like you or me because we're like, this guy is crazy.

01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:55.800
He's a very high functioning, very smart, delusional person who has forest gumped himself

01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:59.340
into every single historically important thing.

01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:04.020
And Alex has just allowed him to do that and reinforce his credibility over and over and

01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:05.260
over and over again.

01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:07.860
And now it doesn't look so good.

01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:08.860
Yeah.

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:14.180
It's not like Steve is a pathological liar that is aware of his pathology and is laughing

01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:16.500
at you for buying anything that he says.

01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:17.500
He might be.

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:24.740
He's a liar, he's a pathological liar who is laughing at you for not believing his lies.

01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:25.740
Maybe both.

01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:26.740
Yeah.

01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:27.740
And you know what?

01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:31.580
Steve wasn't like laughing at Alex when he said he wouldn't come back on his show.

01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:32.580
He was being dismissive.

01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:33.580
Yeah.

01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:35.580
He was like, well, if I'm wrong, I'm not coming on your show.

01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:38.020
Don't have me on your show anymore.

01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:41.020
He was asserting confidence more than anything.

01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:48.420
I think it's so funny how much Alex condescended to the Q shaman who is a fan of his, who believes

01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:51.560
almost identical shit to Steve Pechenik.

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:55.500
And then how much he got his ass handed to him by Steve Pechenik, who is supposed to

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:56.500
be his friend.

01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:57.500
Yup.

01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:59.900
And the Q shaman is going to prison.

01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:04.460
Maybe that's why these people just exist is because it's not possible for them to have

01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:06.180
good relationships with people.

01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:08.220
Like they simply cannot do it.

01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:15.700
What they believe is friendship is exploitation and what they believe is a love or affection

01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:18.100
is actually a secret plot to kill them.

01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:22.740
Well, I mean, you know, I'm quoting Pete Santilli here, you know, everybody in the right wing

01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:26.620
is they're just waiting for the right bidder to sell you out.

01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:27.620
Ain't that the truth?

01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:29.100
Ain't that the truth?

01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:35.780
So at this point on this emergency Saturday broadcast, Alex gets into what I would describe

01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:39.760
as incredibly familiar territory.

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:42.380
My goal, I woke up about 3 a.m. this morning and couldn't sleep.

01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:45.660
And you know, you're so clear at like 3 a.m. when you've went to bed at like 8, I went

01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:48.660
to bed early, got up at like 3 a.m., had some coffee and I was really clear, was out on

01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:49.660
the back porch.

01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:53.560
You look at the mist and I thought, I need to go on air tomorrow like it's my last show

01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:55.580
ever and say that to people.

01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:56.860
And then I forgot to do that.

01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:58.480
You just said that.

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:01.860
And so people download this to hard drive, save it.

01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:05.460
This show, next week's show, literally there's a good chance it's our last show.

01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:06.460
It's not drama.

01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:07.460
Okay.

01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:10.340
So Mike, speak to that and then after you're gone, I'll have my messages if it's my last

01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:14.580
show because this is the knowledge now that if they just have this knowledge in the future,

01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:15.840
they're going to win and beat the globalists.

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:19.600
We did this already.

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:20.820
This is so frustrating.

01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:21.820
Yeah.

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:22.820
You know why?

01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:28.700
Because it was a running bit on our show because he kept saying this and then on November 24th,

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:29.700
he actually did it.

01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:30.700
Yep.

01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:31.700
And it was sad.

01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:32.700
Yep.

01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:33.700
It was a failure.

01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:34.700
Complete.

01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:35.700
It was a great failure.

01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:36.700
Fucked up.

01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:37.700
Yep.

01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:38.700
And I understand why he'd want to do it over.

01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:39.700
Oh yeah.

01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:40.700
Just call them all again.

01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:41.700
But it's just so annoying.

01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:42.700
Nothing.

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:43.700
Nothing matters.

01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:45.820
We, we did the payoff for this joke already.

01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:46.980
Why are you doing it again?

01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:48.060
Why are you hurting me?

01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:49.060
Yeah.

01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:50.060
This feels like it's personal.

01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:51.060
This is a personal attack.

01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:55.600
I'm not a good enough comedian to pull off doing this joke again.

01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:57.660
We already did the season.

01:41:57.660 --> 01:41:58.660
Totally.

01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:04.680
We've, we've like, look, I had one joke that I told for longer than three years.

01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:07.900
And even that was a little bit too long.

01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:09.740
This was, this is over.

01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:10.740
We move on.

01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:11.980
We write new material.

01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:12.980
We got to go.

01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:14.600
Alex, you're a hack.

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:15.600
You're a hack.

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:16.600
It is.

01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:17.600
It's hacky.

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:18.600
It's hacky.

01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:21.780
It's like, okay, you're a writer for home improvement, right?

01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:23.220
I don't know why this came into my head.

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:25.020
Maybe it's because Tim Allen's a conservative dude.

01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:26.020
Sure.

01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:27.760
Tim Allen is the star of the show.

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:33.540
So there's an episode that you do and like a season later, he insists that you do the

01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:39.420
same story and pretends or seems to not be aware that you've done this story already.

01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:43.380
And now you got to try and find a way to make this episode happen because he's the fucking

01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:48.080
star and what he says goes, now you got to try and make it funny again that Alex is doing

01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:50.700
his goddamn fake last broadcast again.

01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:51.700
I'm, I'm, I'm furious.

01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:52.700
It's terrible.

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:53.700
Just terrible.

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:57.580
If there's one thing that does work and is really funny, it's that Mike Adams is taking

01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:00.420
it very seriously because he is very dramatic.

01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:02.420
He's a dramatic man.

01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:04.100
He's like, it is such an honor to be here.

01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:05.100
Oh my God.

01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:06.100
No, no.

01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:07.100
Yeah.

01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:08.100
Come on.

01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:09.100
Yeah.

01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:10.600
You fucking.

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:11.600
It's really silly.

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:12.600
All right.

01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:15.500
And so he gets to talk to you about how, and all this goes down, right?

01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:21.920
When the fascist state that comes and puts us all into a bind, once that falls, people

01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:28.940
like Alex, people like Mike and the info warriors will be needed to rebuild society.

01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:33.580
The evil fascist regime will eventually fall.

01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:35.060
It will fall under its own arrogance.

01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:40.820
It will fall under its own mistakes under the weight of its own deception.

01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:44.700
It will eventually fall as many evil regimes have fallen in the past.

01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:54.900
You know, we defeated the third Reich, the USSR fell, and this American, I can't even

01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:59.720
call it American, this globalist coup against America will not last forever.

01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:00.720
It will fall.

01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:05.940
And when it does fall, it's people like you and I and the listeners to the show who will

01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:14.260
be necessary to rebuild the next society in the image of Christian principles and values

01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:19.940
with added new freedoms that weren't in the original bill of rights, such as health freedom,

01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:24.860
the right to always say no to medical interventions, to say no to vaccines, to say, Medicare for

01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:26.500
none.

01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:31.820
That right, which was, I think, Dr. Benjamin Rush, wasn't it?

01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:36.060
Who wanted to put that in the initial bill of rights, but it didn't make it in there.

01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:38.660
We need that to be the third amendment, for example.

01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:43.300
You know, we need the first amendment, freedom of speech and religious expression, second

01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:46.580
amendment, but we need a third amendment, freedom, health freedom.

01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.460
You always have the right to control your own body.

01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:50.380
The government can never force anything upon you.

01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:54.420
I mean this sincerely, I don't know if Mike Adams knows there's already a third amendment.

01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:57.180
I genuinely agree with you.

01:44:57.180 --> 01:44:58.540
One hundred percent believe you.

01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:02.140
That means he might not know about the other ones after it.

01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:03.140
That's fucking scary.

01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:06.860
I'll tell you the one that he definitely doesn't want to know about.

01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:09.740
Anyone that involves slavery.

01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:12.260
Some of those later ones he's probably a little bit iffy on.

01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:14.100
Very against.

01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:16.020
That was weird.

01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:20.600
I don't, I mean like I understand that he dwells in a media space that really obsesses

01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:23.940
about the first and second.

01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:25.900
I mean the third is pretty important too.

01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:26.900
That's that quartering soldiers one.

01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:32.340
Yeah, I was going to say, I really remember that being quartering soldiers, but then I,

01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:33.340
see this is the problem.

01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:37.940
Whenever people like him say stuff so insanely confident and I'm, I have to be like, I swear

01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:43.600
to you, I know what this is, but there's a question for one second of like, maybe I just

01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:44.660
mistook it.

01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:45.660
Maybe I could be wrong.

01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:47.200
It could be the sixth amendment.

01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:48.260
Maybe I don't know.

01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:52.460
Even if you're in this extreme right wing world, like there was a real long stretch

01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:56.380
of time during Obama's presidency where they were obsessed with the 10th amendment, you

01:45:56.380 --> 01:46:00.460
know, about state's rights and all that nonsense.

01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:06.060
And so like, I don't, I don't understand, like, I mean it would be so easy just to say

01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:09.580
we need another amendment instead of a third.

01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:10.580
Jesus.

01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:11.580
Oh boy.

01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:17.260
There are, the people who have spent so much time slapping a constitution, telling you

01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:21.980
to read it, and putting it in their pocket have never read it and definitely couldn't

01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:23.140
understand it if they did.

01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:27.020
Also, I think that Mike's imagined health freedom amendment would guarantee access to

01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:28.940
reproductive health care, including abortion.

01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:29.940
No, no, no, no.

01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:32.260
It would guarantee the right to not have access to those.

01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:35.900
I know that he's considering that like, it's like a thing where the government can't force

01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:39.200
you to have medical things done, but wouldn't you also want to make sure the government

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:43.600
can't force you to not have any medical procedure you think is necessary done?

01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:46.300
That seems like an important element of health freedom.

01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:47.700
These people are fundamentally stupid.

01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:48.900
I just can't stand it.

01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:52.300
I hate, I hate this dramatic weirdo.

01:46:52.300 --> 01:46:55.500
This guy is so weird, he thinks evil eyes exist.

01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:59.100
I just, I just don't know.

01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:09.420
I love the deadpan, just junior high guy going through puberty, kind of like, everything

01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:14.060
is so serious, kind of delivery of, they're gonna dirty bomb us.

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:17.300
It's an honor to be here with you, Alex, on your last show.

01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:21.660
After the fall of the American fascist state, people like you and me will be needed to rebuild

01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:22.660
society.

01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:23.660
Oh god.

01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:29.020
Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the a-slings and arrows of outrageous dirty

01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:30.020
bombs.

01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:31.020
Yeah.

01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:37.340
So now Alex is supposed to be doing his last episode thing here, but instead he has Robert

01:47:37.340 --> 01:47:39.300
Barnes on.

01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:40.860
That would be his last episode.

01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:45.420
Barnes just talks more shit about Q. He's just on to talk more nonsense about Q.

01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:46.420
I hate him.

01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:50.620
But he's talking about, okay, so Barnes is laying out like what QAnon did.

01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:54.540
And one of the things that they did was they, they targeted certain groups.

01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:59.940
Now, if you listen to this, it sounds almost identical to the Infowars business model.

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:06.220
They also targeted three groups in particular, QAnon targeted first, people that otherwise

01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:10.060
are crowdsourcing grassroots investigative journalists.

01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:14.020
Second, they targeted soldiers and ex soldiers.

01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:20.300
Third, they targeted cops and ex cops and people that also were religious.

01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:24.100
So there are people that are accustomed to believing in a source of authority independent

01:48:24.100 --> 01:48:28.620
of and separate from the state, incorporated references to religious rhetoric, incorporated

01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:32.940
references to Bible verses, incorporated references to God.

01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:35.980
This is gnostic, gnostic Roman cult stuff.

01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:36.980
Explain that.

01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:38.500
You're describing Infowars.

01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:42.780
That should be his last broadcast because it's Barnes explaining what Alex does.

01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:43.780
Yeah.

01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:44.780
More or less.

01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:45.780
Unreal.

01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:48.500
So Alex gets to complaining about the FBI.

01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:52.900
If this was Shakespeare, he would give that soliloquy and then immediately be stabbed.

01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:54.620
That is how this works.

01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:55.620
Okay.

01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:59.860
So Alex is talking about the FBI and he's made a big deal about how they're like saying

01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:01.820
that he caused the uprising.

01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:05.060
He planned the storming of the Capitol.

01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:07.780
He comes clean a little bit about what they actually had questions about.

01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:08.780
Sure.

01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:09.780
Let me bring this up to you now.

01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:10.780
I'm talking about myself.

01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:14.340
The FBI contacted our security people, wanted to bring them in, wanted to talk to them.

01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:15.340
Oh, we don't care about Alex.

01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:16.340
We want to talk to you.

01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:18.420
And then we refused to get lawyers.

01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:20.680
And so they go, okay, don't worry about it.

01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:23.420
We just got false reports that you guys were in the Capitol.

01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:24.420
Just tell us you weren't in the Capitol.

01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:25.740
Yeah, we weren't in the Capitol.

01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:31.500
So, so Sam was, your camera man was, he was doing a plug when he went in.

01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:33.740
Do you know how we know that?

01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:34.740
It's on your website.

01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:35.820
On your website.

01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:38.660
It is being broadcast on your website.

01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:40.940
I got it from bam.video.

01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:47.060
Also, if I were the FBI, I too would be like, let's talk to your security people.

01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:48.060
Not you.

01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:49.060
You lying piece of shit.

01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:50.060
Yeah.

01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:51.060
I've seen your depositions.

01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:52.060
You're not helpful.

01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:53.060
Yeah.

01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:54.060
No, no.

01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:56.980
We did hire Larry Klayman for this one though, so it's pretty exciting.

01:49:56.980 --> 01:50:01.700
Alex talked to Barnes about how bad Q is for a while and it's annoying.

01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:07.500
And then he gets on his own and he reads a fake Cicero quote.

01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:08.500
Okay.

01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:13.540
He reads a real, uh, quote, uh, his favorite quote, the man in the arena.

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:14.540
Okay.

01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:16.620
The, uh, uh, Teddy Roosevelt quote.

01:50:16.620 --> 01:50:17.620
Yeah.

01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:22.900
The bystanders and the, the, the, the reviewers, they matter not the man in the arena, he falters

01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:23.900
and that is okay.

01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:24.900
All right, Teddy.

01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:25.900
That kind of shit.

01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:26.900
All right, Teddy.

01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:28.340
He does, he reads that quote so much.

01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:30.860
I think it's the only thing that gives his life meaning anymore.

01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:31.860
Yeah.

01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:32.860
Yeah.

01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:35.460
Then he goes a little bit off track.

01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:36.460
Okay.

01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:39.860
So we got, we got Roosevelt.

01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:40.860
We got Cicero.

01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:41.860
Sure.

01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:47.940
And now this, then a friend of mine sent me this text message this morning, subject forwarded

01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:53.940
from a friend, a man named Tom Nicholson posted on Facebook, his account, the sports car that

01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:55.300
he had just bought.

01:50:55.300 --> 01:51:00.540
Now a man approached and told him that the money used to buy the car could have fed thousands

01:51:00.540 --> 01:51:06.140
of less fortunate people, but the industry and the factories that built it also built

01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:10.660
the factories that built the tractors, dumb ass, and also built the desire for people

01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:14.700
to have nicer things that then to build a desire for better medicine and better technology

01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:15.700
and a better future.

01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:16.700
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:17.700
I'm not ready.

01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:22.940
When he said his response to the man made him famous on the internet, read a story as

01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:28.380
stated on Facebook below, a guy looked at my Corvette the other day and said, I wonder

01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:33.300
how many people could have been fed for the money that sports car cost.

01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:35.780
I replied, I'm not sure.

01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:39.500
It fed a lot of families in Bowling Green, Kentucky who built it.

01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.180
It fed the people who made the tires.

01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:44.460
It fed the people who made the components that went into it.

01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:47.940
It fed the people in the copper mine who mined the copper for the wires.

01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:52.060
Alex is reading a chain email that your grandma would send you.

01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:53.060
Yup.

01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:54.060
This is nuts.

01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:56.340
Uh, yeah, I believe this is the meme.

01:51:56.340 --> 01:52:02.440
This is the same meme that it's like the military man was in the professor's room and the professor

01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:08.300
was like, war is bad and the military man stood up and was like, I hate liberals.

01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:09.940
And then it was outrageous.

01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:10.940
Yeah.

01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:11.940
I was like, I don't know.

01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:12.940
Fuck off.

01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:14.260
I thought this was supposed to be your last broadcast.

01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:15.520
You're reading a chain email.

01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:17.220
What is going on?

01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:19.020
You know, I said this would be my last broadcast.

01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:23.500
It really could, but I, it's just too heavy of a subject to say this is my last broadcast

01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:25.780
and then do it here.

01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:28.940
I'm just too tired already, but I'm going to write some notes tonight and tomorrow and

01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:32.580
come on the Sunday show four to 6 PM and give you my view on the world.

01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:34.340
So Sunday's going to be the last show.

01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:35.340
So here we go.

01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:36.340
Let's do the last show.

01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:38.300
That's catnip to you, Dan.

01:52:38.300 --> 01:52:39.300
It is.

01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:40.300
Yes.

01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:41.300
And that's why we have to include Sunday.

01:52:41.300 --> 01:52:42.300
Of course.

01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:43.300
But we're not done with Saturday yet.

01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:44.300
Oh God.

01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:50.300
Saturday ends in just a remarkable way for anybody who really thinks that Alex Jones

01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:54.320
is like, sincerely religious, enjoy.

01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:58.700
So I will end the transmission with this, the Lord's prayer.

01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:02.080
Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done

01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:03.820
on earth as is in heaven.

01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:07.180
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:11.380
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the

01:53:11.380 --> 01:53:13.060
power of the glory forever.

01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:14.060
Amen.

01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:15.060
All right.

01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:17.780
I appreciate the crew.

01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:18.860
I appreciate their work.

01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:23.380
I would just ask the listeners, I don't know how long we're going to be on air.

01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:24.700
We got great products you need.

01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:27.860
A lot of them are about to sell out winter sun for your immune system.

01:53:27.860 --> 01:53:29.340
It's about to sell out.

01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:33.460
I don't know about the Lord's prayer going that quickly into an ad, but Jesus went into

01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:36.700
the temple and said, guys, get the fuck out of here.

01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:39.700
I am selling t-shirts.

01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:43.940
That's interesting because Alex is also selling a t-shirt and we have this new shirt designed

01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:49.820
by one of our veteran friends that says trader Joe's and it's got Joe Biden with China and

01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:54.100
Russia and Ukraine and Iran that he sold us out to says trader Joe's.

01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:55.100
It's a fun shirt.

01:53:55.100 --> 01:54:00.180
It's fun info wars.com in all sizes for adults and children.

01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:03.300
And so I suggest you get the shirt at info war store.com.

01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:07.180
It's a limited edition shirt and it lets us have a little bit of fun with the new puppet

01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:11.580
dictator that they are installing.

01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:13.740
That's why Steve Pacinich said, oh, it's my last show with you.

01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:15.060
Cause it's the jokes on me.

01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:18.660
He thinks, or he really believes what he's saying and he thinks he's going to get a job

01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:22.660
here if somehow Biden designs and Trump's the president.

01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:26.540
Well, yeah, he's got a job here if that moonshot happens.

01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:27.540
Wow.

01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:32.100
People want to listen to Pacinich anyways, interesting guy, but I think he's a little

01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:33.900
more on the devil side of the angel side.

01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:42.460
And I'll tell him that the way he talks down to people, the way those guys act like they're

01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:44.580
the big gosh, they're in the system.

01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:45.780
I'm the outsider.

01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:47.520
I'm not the system.

01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:51.940
That's who I'll always be because I'm here changing the system and that's my job.

01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:53.660
Not to be part of the system.

01:54:53.660 --> 01:54:54.660
Okay.

01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:55.660
Again, great job to the crew.

01:54:55.660 --> 01:54:57.940
He seems really mad.

01:54:57.940 --> 01:55:05.840
I hate, I hate how comfortable these people are with demons existing on our plane and

01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:11.900
running things to the point where you would be like, Hey, here's a fun t-shirt about this

01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:14.660
demon that's running the world.

01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:15.660
Yeah.

01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:16.660
Yeah.

01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:20.460
It is, it is a little bizarre for him to be like, we made this pun t-shirt so we could

01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:22.060
have a little fun with the dictator.

01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:23.060
It's the devil!

01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:24.060
Yeah.

01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:25.060
It's a satanic globalist dictator.

01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:26.060
Oh man.

01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:27.060
It's very weird.

01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:28.060
That's so annoying.

01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:29.060
That's so annoying.

01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:37.020
A demon is an existential threat and you're like, eh, we'll make this fun little t-shirt.

01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:38.820
So we're on to Sunday now.

01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:39.820
Sure.

01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:40.820
Last broadcast.

01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:41.820
Final broadcast ever.

01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:43.900
This bit is finally going to be put to rest.

01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:49.940
Well, Alex can't get to it right away because there's news and he has a new group to blame

01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:52.180
for what happened on the sixth.

01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:55.340
Now we knew it was Antifa that told you that the day of the event.

01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:56.340
After?

01:55:56.340 --> 01:56:00.620
He told you who the operator was, where he came from in Utah, how he led over a hundred

01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:02.340
Antifa addresses to Trump supporters.

01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:03.340
A hundred?

01:56:03.340 --> 01:56:04.340
When?

01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:05.340
What?

01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:08.320
I saw folks that didn't look like meth head Antifa on the videos.

01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:10.120
I got there about 30 minutes after it started.

01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:12.500
My employees.

01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:16.560
That looked like right wingers, you know, that didn't look like they'd been grown in

01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:17.560
their mother's basement.

01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:18.560
It looked like I employed them.

01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:24.540
It looked like that actually had some steak and potatoes and dumb little fight.

01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:27.380
And sure as hell we identified who they were.

01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:30.060
They were telling the crowd they were proud boys, but I checked them.

01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:31.780
They weren't proud boys.

01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:34.780
They were boogaloo's.

01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:37.420
No.

01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:39.140
Boogaloo boys going under the bus.

01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:40.140
No.

01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:41.140
Slaps.

01:56:41.140 --> 01:56:42.140
Slaps all around.

01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:43.140
Yep.

01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:44.740
Got to throw, uh, throw the boogaloo boys overboard.

01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:45.980
Oh man.

01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:50.220
I really like how Alex said boogaloo's there.

01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:51.220
Boogaloo's.

01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:53.140
He really, he really enjoyed it.

01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:54.140
He really did.

01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:55.140
Yeah.

01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:56.140
He really did.

01:56:56.140 --> 01:56:57.140
Yeah.

01:56:57.140 --> 01:57:01.060
So apparently this is how he's going to get around the fact that there were a bunch of

01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:06.060
people who were oath keepers and are in trouble.

01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:07.060
Yeah.

01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:10.340
I assume Stuart Rhodes isn't on this Sunday broadcast.

01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:15.220
Alex is going to soon be making up a story about Stuart Rhodes wife getting run over.

01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:18.100
That's something about their dog.

01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:19.100
Yeah.

01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:20.500
Cause he's going to be in hiding.

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:21.500
Oh boy.

01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:25.060
Anyway, Alex has a new video of the boogaloo boys.

01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:26.060
Sure.

01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:29.300
Oh God, this is so funny.

01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:35.060
Like Alex, he is so bad at this, this whole thing.

01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:39.180
And it's just so incredible because you try to get this out, the only place it gets out

01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:40.180
is here.

01:57:40.180 --> 01:57:41.860
Gateway Punnett's got an article about it, you name it.

01:57:41.860 --> 01:57:43.060
But now it's very clear.

01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:44.060
Wait, what?

01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:50.060
I don't know what happened, but let's hit the first big one I just told you about.

01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:51.060
You can bet your bottom dollar.

01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:54.460
You'll be seeing this on Tucker Carlson tomorrow night because Tucker's the first one to send

01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:55.460
it to me.

01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:57.380
I don't leave it at that.

01:57:57.380 --> 01:58:00.780
But you know, those that are in fight club, don't talk about flight club.

01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:04.220
You know, the second rule of fight club, don't talk about fight club, but I send him stuff.

01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:05.220
He sends me stuff.

01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:06.380
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:09.140
That's exactly against the rules of flight club.

01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:10.620
I just, I just, that's

01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:18.780
I don't know if I could come up with a more Alex Jones sentence than Tucker Carlson sent

01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:19.780
me this clip.

01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:20.780
I'm going to leave it there.

01:58:20.780 --> 01:58:21.780
You just said everything.

01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:22.780
Yep.

01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:24.060
There is nothing more to say.

01:58:24.060 --> 01:58:25.060
Nope.

01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:27.340
This clip was sent to you by Tucker Carlson.

01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:31.660
And if that's true, that tells us all we need to know about Tucker Carlson.

01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:33.940
I'd love to get a comment from Tucker on that.

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:34.940
Absolutely.

01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:39.460
Because I would imagine he would not admit to sending information to Alex.

01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:41.060
I don't think he would like it.

01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:46.220
On account of fight club being ruled as don't talk about fight club.

01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:47.220
Yeah.

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:49.540
And so, I mean, I would imagine that he would say, no, I didn't.

01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:53.820
And then Alex would have to wrestle with why no one will be publicly associated with him.

01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:55.900
But they'll have his employees on their shows.

01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:56.900
Yeah.

01:58:56.900 --> 01:59:03.820
Anyway, at this point, we've now decided that the Boogaloo boys are going to be blamed for

01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:06.500
anybody who appears to be right wing.

01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:10.800
So we got Antifa for people who don't feel right wing and we got Boogaloo for people

01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:11.800
who are wrong.

01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:13.220
And QAnon for people who are weird.

01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:14.220
Right.

01:59:14.220 --> 01:59:15.220
Even though...

01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:16.220
Sure.

01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:17.220
Yeah.

01:59:17.220 --> 01:59:18.220
Fine.

01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:22.700
So now that that's settled, it's time to go back to familiar territory.

01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:24.180
Let's play this next.

01:59:24.180 --> 01:59:29.900
Over 7,000 strong migrant caravan inches closer to the US border as Biden vows to end Trump

01:59:29.900 --> 01:59:30.900
asylum.

01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:33.580
And this will be hundreds of thousands if not millions like hit Europe.

01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:34.580
It's the UN plan.

01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:39.180
As soon as they knew Biden would let him in, they began the march out of a UN camp in Honduras

01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:40.180
into Guatemala.

01:59:40.180 --> 01:59:41.180
Here it is.

01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:46.140
So, yeah, the migrant caravan narratives are back.

01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:49.940
Just, just, just do it.

01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:55.800
Take four years off and run reruns where you just edit in Biden over Obama.

01:59:55.800 --> 01:59:56.940
It's going to be the same thing.

01:59:56.940 --> 01:59:58.940
There'll be a lot of similarities.

01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:03.800
Think about how much time you can take off if you're just going to recycle the same shows.

02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:04.800
Let's run reruns.

02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:05.800
Yeah.

02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:11.740
I really, I hope that you have drafts of all of your articles from the Obama days.

02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:13.220
Save those Google docs.

02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:14.220
Yeah.

02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:19.780
So, yeah, man, migrants are coming to America and it's a UN plan that is war.

02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:20.780
Why not?

02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:25.180
War doesn't look like it did in Vietnam or Korea or the Gulf war.

02:00:25.180 --> 02:00:26.380
This is modern war.

02:00:26.380 --> 02:00:28.780
This is globalist war against the nation state.

02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:32.380
So wear your mask and take your vaccines and roll over and die.

02:00:32.380 --> 02:00:35.340
Remember this submission only makes it worse.

02:00:35.340 --> 02:00:37.100
This is the end of America.

02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:40.180
In the next two years, the country will not exist.

02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:41.180
Guaranteed.

02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:47.980
I mean, almost kind of feels like you're saying a good answer would be to storm the Capitol.

02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:48.980
Yeah.

02:00:48.980 --> 02:00:49.980
Yeah.

02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:50.980
It does sound like we are at war.

02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:51.980
Yeah.

02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:55.920
And the enemy is demons trying to bring in immigrants.

02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:59.460
That sounds some suspiciously like white nationalists talking.

02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:00.460
Oh, big time.

02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:02.300
It really feels like that's white nationalists.

02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:03.300
Oh, really?

02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:04.300
Yeah.

02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:08.900
Just part of the great replacement, the great migration, the UN uses people as a weapon.

02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:09.900
They turn their food off.

02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:11.120
They turn their jobs off.

02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:14.900
You just think you're staying home for a few months and okay, it's a vacation.

02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:18.060
No, it's collapsing the border.

02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:21.400
When you become poor, the third world starves to death.

02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:24.300
When the first world collapses, the third world dies.

02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:29.380
How many times did I drill that into your head?

02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:36.020
And now in Europe and now in the US everywhere, the borders are collapsing and giant third

02:01:36.020 --> 02:01:39.860
world populations that don't have jobs and don't have infrastructures are coming here

02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:41.860
to do what?

02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:44.120
Collapse the infrastructure.

02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:45.860
First they get you to not go to work.

02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:47.720
Next they get you to say you're not essential.

02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:49.460
Next they shut down main street.

02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:51.580
Next they shut down the side streets.

02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:56.660
Then they come in and tell you that you've got to open your borders up because the third

02:01:56.660 --> 02:02:00.940
world starving to death and mass and then they get here and they're organized into political

02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:06.020
weapons and political groups that from the beginning were trained for up to a year in

02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:15.060
a UN refugee camp in Marxist, Leninist ideology projected by Mark Zuckerberg, projected by

02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:20.060
Jeff Bezos, projected by all them on record commanding it.

02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:21.060
That's quite a sentence.

02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:22.060
Uh, yeah.

02:02:22.060 --> 02:02:26.420
You know, you had any concerns that it might not be a white nationalist thing.

02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:27.420
Yeah, I wasn't.

02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:28.420
Certainly.

02:02:28.420 --> 02:02:29.420
Certainly.

02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:30.420
Really made it pretty clear there.

02:02:30.420 --> 02:02:31.420
Let's put it bad.

02:02:31.420 --> 02:02:35.180
Now I would say that, I mean, we've been over this territory so many times in the past when

02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:38.220
he's gotten into the, the past caravan narratives.

02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:43.980
Now this is, is very much based on a white identity fear.

02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:44.980
Totally.

02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:51.700
Now I would say that the behavior that he's engaging in and the way that he's framing

02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:55.860
a lot of these ideas are very dangerous.

02:02:55.860 --> 02:03:01.180
They are the sort of things that I do think sound a lot like incitement towards violence

02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:04.400
of people that you suspect might be immigrants.

02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:05.820
This is the takeover.

02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:10.420
This is modern warfare using giant third world starving hordes that have been put in the

02:03:10.420 --> 02:03:14.820
position of starvation or invasion and the UN is going to manage with the left every

02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:17.880
damn bit of it and they're going to swamp your red city.

02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:21.500
They're going to swamp your red town and they're going to take your ass over cause you're under

02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:23.060
military attack.

02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:31.300
I don't know what you would expect the outcome of that to be other than like rank xenophobia

02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:37.700
and the possibility of violence directed towards people that are determined to be immigrants

02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:39.700
whether or not they actually are.

02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:42.660
Followed by a sign at every border that says whites only.

02:03:42.660 --> 02:03:45.860
Yeah, it's, it's pretty bad.

02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:51.300
It's not unfamiliar territory for Alex certainly, but I just constantly end up getting in a

02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:55.780
position where like the world is really like serious.

02:03:55.780 --> 02:04:00.820
You know, like I, I just don't understand how Alex can not be living in a world of reflection

02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:06.940
about how serious things are and how unhinged people are and how, how dangerous we are in

02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:10.240
a mis, like a misinformed populace.

02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:17.580
People are living outside the prism of reality and I don't believe that he is a committed

02:04:17.580 --> 02:04:22.540
believer of the things that are distorted reality.

02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:23.540
Absolutely not.

02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:25.980
He's, he's, he's monetized it.

02:04:25.980 --> 02:04:30.180
He's exploiting the fact that other people are living in the fake reality that he preaches.

02:04:30.180 --> 02:04:31.180
Yeah, I was going to say.

02:04:31.180 --> 02:04:34.780
So he wouldn't be able to operate if he actually believed the things that he's saying.

02:04:34.780 --> 02:04:35.780
Of course not.

02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:37.040
He wouldn't be able to work.

02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:38.940
He wouldn't be able to do any of this shit.

02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:44.380
He would be dead by now because he would have stormed the Austin Capitol 10 years ago.

02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:45.380
Totally.

02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:47.940
It's not, it's, it's nonsense.

02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:52.420
And I, I, I just constantly think like, well now we'll take it seriously.

02:04:52.420 --> 02:04:53.420
And he just never does.

02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:54.420
He never does.

02:04:54.420 --> 02:04:57.240
No, it's, I mean, yeah, it's, it's hard to say any of that.

02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:00.580
You know, when you ask like, how do these people not take it more seriously?

02:05:00.580 --> 02:05:02.140
And it's just like scream.

02:05:02.140 --> 02:05:04.520
I just, MONEY!

02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:05.520
It's MONEY!

02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:07.100
It can't matter that much though.

02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:08.100
It does!

02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:09.100
I guess.

02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:10.100
It matters so fucking much.

02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:11.100
I guess.

02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:14.920
Anyway, Alex gets to talking about how his enemies are ugly and they want to kill you

02:05:14.920 --> 02:05:19.020
and he rambles a bit about this and then he's just, I don't know.

02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:22.520
I would say that this is an incitement towards violence too.

02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:29.180
And it's all weird, disreputable creatures because that's all they can get because there's

02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:35.700
such virtue in humanity that no good looking, no well-spoken, no honorable man will even

02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:37.180
serve this.

02:05:37.180 --> 02:05:40.960
But it still doesn't matter because just because honorable men don't take the field and don't

02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:44.640
join the enemy, the enemy goes great because you didn't join the fight.

02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:49.060
And the fight is informational, it's cultural, it's spiritual, and it's about boycotting and

02:05:49.060 --> 02:05:53.660
it's about information war and it is about noncompliance.

02:05:53.660 --> 02:05:56.160
It is about civil disobedience and it won't matter.

02:05:56.160 --> 02:05:59.800
They're going to hurt you so bad because they have a nature, like a child molester has got

02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:02.540
to rape a child or a murderer has got to kill.

02:06:02.540 --> 02:06:06.980
They just have this drive and this desire and they've got to have power over you and

02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:10.960
they got to inject you and they got to shut your farm down and they got to shut your business

02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:15.680
down and they got to see their stock go up at Amazon and they just got to do it and they

02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:20.240
just got to put you down, they can't help it.

02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:25.240
And they're going to go and go and go and go and go, they can't ever stop until you

02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:26.240
stop them.

02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:28.720
They can't stop until you stop them.

02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:29.720
Wild.

02:06:29.720 --> 02:06:30.720
Wild.

02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:31.720
Yeah.

02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:34.880
It's not a good look overall.

02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:35.880
You know what I've always thought?

02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:44.280
I've always thought that the Democrats secret weapon could be governing the country well

02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:50.120
and they refuse to do that for the same reason Alex refuses to take the six seriously.

02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:51.800
Money!

02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:57.880
If you material improved the lives of the, I just, I'm just running my, I'm losing my

02:06:57.880 --> 02:06:58.880
mind.

02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:06.880
Um, and if you think that Alex is solely driven by money, um, then I would suggest that this

02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:10.520
must be what everyone keeps telling him to do more of.

02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:13.680
Humpty Dumpty, Brian Stelter, we're like a hundred thousand viewers.

02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:14.680
He led her bitches.

02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:15.680
No one watches me.

02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:16.680
Well, no kidding, dude.

02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:17.680
You look like a child molester.

02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:22.920
I'm not saying you are one, but I mean, I'm not letting you babysit my kids, bro.

02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:23.920
You molest the truth.

02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:24.920
I'm sorry.

02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:25.960
Let's go back to them.

02:07:25.960 --> 02:07:26.960
Both are happening.

02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:29.720
Both are from the same platforms and the same pro-Trump media outlets.

02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:30.720
Both are problematic.

02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:33.900
Um, Chris, what do you say to the following?

02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:37.640
We have to be clear eyed about what is a domestic terror threat, but also very careful not to

02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:38.680
exaggerate it.

02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:39.680
Not to overstate it.

02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:40.680
We're on this again.

02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:41.680
We're on it in 10 seconds.

02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:42.680
There's a domestic terror threat.

02:07:42.680 --> 02:07:43.680
It's called your speech.

02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:46.360
Oh, they killed four Americans at the Capitol.

02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:48.240
There was a riot, a small riot.

02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:51.220
It's the worst thing since Pearl Harbor.

02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:52.220
You're a child.

02:07:52.220 --> 02:07:53.900
Well, we gotta be careful not to exaggerate it.

02:07:53.900 --> 02:07:55.180
He plays all these games.

02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:57.320
Let's go back to this shack of puss.

02:07:57.320 --> 02:08:01.200
It's interesting because it was supposed to be his fake last show again, and it is fitting

02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:07.360
that he would do an entire segment complaining about a Brian Stelter piece on his fake last

02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:09.640
show because that should go in the time capsule.

02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:10.640
Totally.

02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:11.640
100%.

02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:14.840
It has been a while since he's done one of these where he just plays a Brian Stelter

02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:18.160
interview that's just uncontroversial.

02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:19.680
Just a completely normal...

02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:24.360
Yeah, I was listening to it and I was like, first of all, he's not saying the things that

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:25.840
Alex is responding to.

02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:28.600
Second, it is not a hot take.

02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:34.240
It is a pretty soft conversation about misinformation online.

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:38.360
You would take Brian Stelter to just a regular old like, hey, how have you been?

02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:43.520
And turn it into a 10 minute long, this is why he's a demon who mouths the truth.

02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:44.520
Look at his eyes.

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:45.520
Oh, God.

02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:50.480
So anyway, for old time's sake, here's a minute 40 of Alex just getting really mad at Stelter.

02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:54.220
We have to be clear eyed about what is a domestic terror threat, but also very careful not to

02:08:54.220 --> 02:09:02.000
exaggerate it, not to overstate it, not to create undue fear in this country right now.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:03.280
I think that's absolutely right.

02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:05.480
We've got to be very careful here.

02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:10.520
Just because someone may believe that the president did not win the election or the

02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:15.320
president elect Biden did not win or that someone believes in QAnon doesn't mean that

02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:18.700
they're going to go pick up arms and pause again.

02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:21.400
It's like we're outlawing him questioning the election, but we don't put them in the

02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:23.020
FEMA camp right away.

02:09:23.020 --> 02:09:24.020
Did he say that?

02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:25.020
Did anybody say that?

02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:26.020
No.

02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:27.020
What are we talking about here?

02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:28.020
Oh, we don't.

02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:29.020
We just shut them down.

02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:30.020
And then, oh, we kill them.

02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:33.560
This is all psychological scripts they're reading.

02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:36.520
Super predatory, super dangerous, super evil.

02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:37.520
Continue.

02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:38.520
Is that possible, Alex?

02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:43.640
Will there ever be a solution, a real clear, full solution to this information crisis that

02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:47.420
has been perpetuated in my view by platforms like the one you're used to work face?

02:09:47.420 --> 02:09:50.040
Is there a final solution, he's asking?

02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:54.480
Like, how do we deal with these people that, like, you know, saw them with suitcases in

02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:58.680
Georgia, pulling them out and closing things and saying the water main broke and then all

02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:04.360
these Biden votes come in and it happened and all, you know, Biden can't get 20 people

02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:05.360
that Trump gets a million.

02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:07.080
But, you know, what do we do?

02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:08.080
What's the solution?

02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:09.080
We're going to come back.

02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:10.080
I'm going to be nice.

02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:12.680
I'm going to play the clip unedited because by edited, I'm jumping in.

02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:13.680
I'm talking over.

02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:18.320
It's just it's hard to look at someone with no viewers, but it doesn't matter.

02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:19.320
It's what the banks.

02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:22.140
They know that the globalist word is through Stelter.

02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:23.480
That's Jeff Zucker.

02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:27.200
And so here is this, this, this, this Hitler, this Stalin, this Mao.

02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:31.800
I mean, they call us that he's the one trying to stealth everybody.

02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:34.080
It's Brian Stelter.

02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:35.080
He's Hitler.

02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:36.080
I'm not.

02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:40.740
Look, I'm not saying he's not a public figure or he hasn't accomplished anything.

02:10:40.740 --> 02:10:42.960
I'm just saying he's Brian Stelter.

02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:44.600
Yeah, he's Hitler.

02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:48.120
He's Brian Stelter is the voice of the globalists.

02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:49.120
Really?

02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:51.840
The voice of the globalists, Brian Stelter.

02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:57.800
I hate how small potatoes everybody who's a big deal is to these people.

02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:03.280
I think it's fascinating because, you know, like if this is the pretend last show, it

02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:04.280
makes sense.

02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:10.600
I mean, like all day, Alex hates Brian Stelter for reasons that I can't quite figure out,

02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:16.000
except that Brian Stelter has mentioned Alex a couple of times and he comes off as a less

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.200
than Alex's definition of masculine man.

02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:20.200
Sure.

02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:23.040
And I think that that bothers Alex on some level.

02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:24.040
Right.

02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:29.080
It feels like he's been emasculated by a less masculine man in Alex's eyes.

02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:31.400
And just saying that Alex is a dumb-dumb.

02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:36.900
And because I don't think that Brian Stelter lets Alex live in his mind, whereas Alex is

02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:40.000
clearly thinking about Brian Stelter all the time.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
All the time.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:42.000
He's curious about him.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.680
Yeah, he hate watches Brian Stelter so much.

02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:44.680
He has to.

02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:49.640
And you see this, like, just to come out on the show, these outbursts, it's amazing.

02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:52.240
I'm so glad that I've passed my Friedersdorf stage.

02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:53.800
Yeah, well, you had to get it out of your system.

02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:56.000
I had my time and now it's over.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000
You processed it.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Yeah.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Unhealthy, healthy.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Yeah, yeah, I got through it.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Yeah.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Yes.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:05.360
So Alex comes back from break and he promises, I'm not going to interrupt now.

02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:12.320
And they're just, I mean, this is so textbook 1984 and you're just watching these criminals

02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:14.560
talk about it, but I'm not going to interrupt them.

02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:16.120
Just go ahead and play it unedited.

02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:18.680
Just play a few minutes of this.

02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:19.680
I'm going to try to shut up.

02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:20.680
Go ahead.

02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:21.680
Five.

02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:25.680
We have to work on the broader disinformation problem to try to turn down the anger that

02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:29.880
you see from that huge percentage of Republicans who believe that the election was stolen.

02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:30.880
It's yeah.

02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:31.880
I'm sorry.

02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:32.880
Stop it.

02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:33.880
Ooh.

02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:34.880
I was really close.

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:35.880
I was really close.

02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:36.880
It was 10 seconds.

02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:39.520
I should have done the countdown.

02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:40.520
So he's unsuccessful.

02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:43.520
He just, oh God, is so much Stelter.

02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:49.760
So he's talking about, uh, how like we're at war to not be enslaved.

02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:50.760
Jesus.

02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:57.640
There comes a point when powerful organizations and groups decide to make their move, no matter

02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:00.040
what happens, they're committed to the fight.

02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:01.360
It has a name.

02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:02.840
It's called war.

02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:07.960
We are now under open globalist attack.

02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:11.160
The United States did not see the sneak attack.

02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:13.880
I tried to warm people for decades.

02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:17.320
People going back to Barry Goldwater, Cleon scouts, and some of the others warned before

02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:21.040
I was even born, but Americans were arrogant.

02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:26.040
They believed that we were so strong, we could not fall.

02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:35.360
We had major rot from within, and now we face the prospect of slavery and massive persecution

02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:41.320
and the full thrust of the globalist attack at levels never before seen.

02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:44.360
That's why tomorrow I'm going to do a special transmission.

02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:46.400
Don't you fucking dare.

02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:50.120
Is this Alex Jones' last broadcast?

02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:51.840
Because every day now is precious.

02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:53.440
Go fuck yourself, man.

02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:55.680
I'm not doing this.

02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:58.920
I'm not going to be strong along by the likes of you.

02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:00.320
I want to start fires.

02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:01.560
I want to start fires.

02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:03.520
I don't want to start building fires.

02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:08.600
I want to start large brush fires just in the street, just to let everyone know what

02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:09.600
is happening.

02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:10.600
Yeah.

02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:12.960
Alex is doing another viral broadcast.

02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:14.960
Like I'm sending smoke signals up.

02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:19.400
There's too many people who are unaware that he is doing this again.

02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:21.040
It's so annoying.

02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:24.840
I need someone to know that he is doing this again.

02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:31.360
It's so annoying, too, because he did nothing but waste time on this Sunday show.

02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:34.400
There's so much just like, it's the Boogaloo Boys.

02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:36.440
That's who we don't like now.

02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:38.000
Tucker Carlson's my source.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Whoops, Fight Club.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Yeah.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:41.000
And then yelling about Stelter.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Stelter.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Helter Stelter hate.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.000
I got blisters on my fingers.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Oh my god.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Yep.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:50.240
I'm so tired, dude.

02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:53.280
There's this last clip here from Sunday is fitting.

02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:55.920
This is kind of how Alex wraps up the show.

02:14:55.920 --> 02:15:02.920
And I will say that it is exciting for me because now on Friday, on our show, we will

02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:05.480
finally get his actual- Sure, sure we will.

02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:06.480
Of course.

02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:07.480
Of course.

02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:08.480
Of course.

02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:09.480
Of course.

02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:10.480
Last episode.

02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:11.480
Yeah.

02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:12.480
But here's how Alex goes out on the seventh.

02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:13.480
Just perfect.

02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:17.520
But I'll just recap what we started the show with before I have this important information.

02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:22.800
We know the Boogaloo's left this group with a few hundred people, staged the attack.

02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:26.240
Only the Q folks were dumb enough to go in to get media attention.

02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:27.240
And your employees.

02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:31.360
It was Q people that went in non-violently to be set up and arrested.

02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:32.360
And your employees.

02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:33.360
They didn't arrest the Boogaloo's.

02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:35.920
When they've arrested Antifa, they're released later.

02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:36.960
They did their job well.

02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:38.720
They set up America.

02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:41.140
Trump knew his supporters were patriotic and non-violent.

02:15:41.140 --> 02:15:42.380
He said be non-violent.

02:15:42.380 --> 02:15:43.380
He didn't incite anything.

02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:45.760
They went down there to say, we see the election fraud.

02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:47.280
We have the numbers to show it.

02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:48.280
Trump fought back.

02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:49.680
He did the right thing.

02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:52.340
He didn't roll over.

02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:55.080
He didn't submit.

02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:59.840
If you want to keep us on air, go to mfoarstore.com and get t-shirts, books, films, got a bunch

02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:03.160
of supplements that are about to sell out that are great for your immune system and

02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:04.160
your body.

02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:08.620
X2, X3, super male vitality, DNA force plus.

02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:14.760
They're all there at mfoarstore.com.

02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:18.460
But separately, this is new world order.

02:16:18.460 --> 02:16:19.460
This is 2020.

02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:27.400
I remember reading when I was 21 years old, 2020 in congressional record, I was into that

02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:28.400
stuff back then.

02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:31.240
It was so interesting.

02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:33.960
So again, here we are.

02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:35.440
Every generation goes through something.

02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:37.600
Every third generation goes into something really big.

02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:38.840
We're going through it right now.

02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:41.280
So I want to thank the crew for their great job.

02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:49.720
There is this amazingly important report from a major pop artist exposing chemtrails and

02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:50.720
country clubs.

02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:51.720
Don't do it.

02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:52.720
I hope that you will share.

02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:53.720
Don't do it.

02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:54.720
Don't do it.

02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:55.720
Don't do it.

02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:56.720
Chemtrails over the country club video.

02:16:56.720 --> 02:16:57.720
Just don't do it.

02:16:57.720 --> 02:16:58.720
It's posted to band.video.

02:16:58.720 --> 02:16:59.720
Here it is.

02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:00.720
That's amazing.

02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:08.480
He introduces Glennon Del Rey's video for chemtrails at the country club as a report.

02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:12.620
That's a very important report, this music video.

02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:17.480
He used a lot of words to say that the Patriot movement is filled with stupid gullible cowards,

02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:21.800
but I understand why he tells his version of the story.

02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:25.680
It's far more exciting than saying that the Patriot movement is a bunch of stupid gullible

02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:26.680
cowards.

02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:28.520
Well, that's what Pete Santilli would say.

02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:29.520
Yeah.

02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:30.520
Man.

02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:35.520
I love, I want to see what the most trivial thing Alex would call an important report

02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:36.520
is.

02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:42.560
We are fighting demons who are overthrowing the United States Republic, destroying the

02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:43.720
constitution.

02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:47.960
We need upwards of two amendments now, and I will tell you this right now.

02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:50.000
We're going to go out to our special report.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.000
That's right.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.260
It is a Looney Tunes cartoon.

02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:54.720
Here we go.

02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:59.480
From our new reporter here at Infowars, Lana Del Rey.

02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:01.040
Jesus.

02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:04.040
God, what a ride.

02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:05.800
What is happening?

02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:06.800
I don't know.

02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:09.680
Are we, are we fake or is he fake?

02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:10.800
I can't tell anymore.

02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:11.920
I just don't know.

02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:12.920
Yeah.

02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:13.920
I just don't know.

02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:17.480
I don't feel like I learned much from this.

02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:18.720
I learned a lot about history.

02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:19.720
Yeah.

02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:20.720
I learned a lot about World War II, Dan.

02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:21.720
Yeah.

02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:25.320
I mean, I'm glad, I'm glad I got the benefit of his thousands of books.

02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:26.320
Totally.

02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:32.320
It's nice to see multiple instances of him just reading Wikipedia pages poorly.

02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:33.320
Yeah.

02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:34.320
God, this is dumb.

02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:35.360
This show is so dumb.

02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:38.240
I'm really excited for Friday, though, because I do think...

02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:39.240
Well, it's his last broadcast.

02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:42.160
Well, I mean, can't wait for the second last broadcast.

02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:44.160
Can't wait for the second last broadcast.

02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:47.440
But it'll be better than the November 24th, for sure.

02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:48.660
Well, I would hope so.

02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:49.660
Can't be worse than that.

02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:50.960
He's had time to think about it.

02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:51.960
Yeah.

02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:52.960
Yeah.

02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:55.080
And multiple false starts.

02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:56.080
Yes.

02:18:56.080 --> 02:18:57.080
Yeah.

02:18:57.080 --> 02:19:00.400
And I just think there will be something interesting on the day of the inauguration.

02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:04.000
Like I hope that everything goes smoothly in the world.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:07.200
You know, we're recording this on Tuesday, it comes out on Wednesday.

02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:10.160
I hope it's an uneventful day by and large.

02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:13.720
But I also hope that Alex cries or something.

02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:14.720
Sure.

02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:16.520
I hope he throws a hatchet or something.

02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:17.520
Yeah.

02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:19.960
Like, I hope there's something interesting and it's not just mopey Alex.

02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:21.680
Yeah, he's gotta bring something.

02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:24.900
There's potential for, like, some real performance.

02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:27.320
And I hope we see something as opposed to nothing.

02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:30.640
But I hope that the something that we see isn't this, like...

02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:38.640
That Sunday show, the hard shift into immigrant bashing is really not good.

02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:42.460
I know that that's a normal thing for Alex, but it had been absent for a little while.

02:19:42.460 --> 02:19:44.200
Or at least on the back burner.

02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:46.000
Really don't like to see it coming forward again.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.000
It's really annoying.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:55.140
Yeah, the full, let's direct our attention away from all Democrats directly towards minorities

02:19:55.140 --> 02:20:01.600
of any shape, specifically ones that aren't white, is normal.

02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:06.240
But it was nice whenever they just wanted to kill us all equally, you know?

02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:10.760
There was a feeling of, yeah, I don't know.

02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:11.760
Camaraderie?

02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:12.760
Yeah, I guess.

02:20:12.760 --> 02:20:13.760
I don't know.

02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:16.000
Anyway, Jordan, we will be back.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:17.680
But until then, we have a website.

02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:18.680
We do have a website.

02:20:18.680 --> 02:20:19.680
It's knowledgefight.com.

02:20:19.680 --> 02:20:20.680
You bet.

02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:21.680
We're on Twitter.

02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:22.680
We are on Twitter.

02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:23.680
It's at Knowledge Fight and I go to bed Jordan.

02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:24.680
We're also on Facebook.

02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:29.200
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:30.640
doing God's work right now.

02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:31.640
We'll be back.

02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:32.640
But until then, I'm Neo.

02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:33.640
I'm Leo.

02:20:33.640 --> 02:20:34.640
I'm DZXClark.

02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:36.760
I'm Daryl Rundis.

02:20:36.760 --> 02:20:39.640
I'm telling Mike Adams to grow the fuck up.

02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:40.640
Andy in Kansas.

02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:41.640
You're on the air.

02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:42.640
Thanks for holding.

02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:43.640
Hello, Alex.

02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:44.640
I'm a first time caller.

02:20:44.640 --> 02:20:45.640
I'm a huge fan.

02:20:45.640 --> 02:20:46.640
I love your work.

02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:55.600
I love you.
