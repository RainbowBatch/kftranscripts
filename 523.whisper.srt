Hello Alex, I'm a true Simpler, I'm a huge fan.

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,880
I love your world.

00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,760

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:07,800
I love you. Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fat, I'm Dan. I'm Jordan. We're a couple dudes, I like to sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk just a touch about Alex Jones. Just like a sprinkling to taste.

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:20,800
I would say a smidge even. I would go so far as to say a smidge. Like pepper in a recipe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A sprinkle or perhaps a toss. A dusting of Alex. Indeed, just a hair. How are you doing Jordan?

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I'm subverting the form. I like it, I like it. How are you doing? Good. I have a question for you. What's that? What is your bright spot today? My bright spot today Jordan is I, first of all, I accept this already, don't fucking, I don't care, don't point a finger at me.

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:54,800
This is preemptive defensiveness Dan, we've talked about this. It is. I'm a sucker for like Lovecraft themed horror video games. Of course. Like storytelling, that sort of thing. Eternal Darkness is one of my favorite video games of all time. Of course. It's great.

28
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Whenever we played Mansions of Madness together you get really into it. It's fantastic. I insist on holding the iPad so I can read the story. You love reading it to us? Yeah, you've got the whole thing. Doing the voice of the Lovecraftian narrator. Of course.

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:24,800
I love it and so I was looking around for a cheap game. Bright Spots have just become video game reviews. At this point. I was looking for something in the five dollar range as I was trying to expand my horizons and I saw one called Lovecraft's Untold Stories.

30
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:45,800
And I'm like, well, I'm a mark. I'm buying this. So I bought it. I'll send you a thousand dollars in the hopes of getting five thousand in return. If the letter is not from a Nigerian prince but it's from someone in Innsmouth then maybe, maybe I'm writing back. Miskatonic University would like a donation of your generous service. No, I'm an alum.

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:03:11,800
I got it and I was really enjoying it and like the first level of it was pretty fun and then it got absurdly hard in the second level. Oh no. It got like unfair levels of heart. Okay. And I actually looked into it because I was like, this can't be right. Something's wrong. Right, right, right. And a bunch of the reviews online were all just like, this game is. This game gets unfairly hard at the second level.

32
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:30,800
It's just like, this is not balanced. And it's true. Yeah. But it was also like not impossible. Sure. It was just really hard. Right, right, right, right. And I kind of, I was playing around with it a little bit and here's the bright spot was that I didn't back down to the difficulty. Nice.

33
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:58,800
I kept trying and I learned and I realized like this is kind of how it used to be with video games. Oh totally. Like if you were playing Mega Man 2 that was fucking hard. It was impossible to do. It was so hard. Yeah. It has that sort of difficulty. Yeah. It's just like, it's really, it's, it's, it's fun. I enjoy it. Anyway. That's awesome. I did beat the second level. Love it. Love it. Congratulations. I felt like it was an actual achievement. Just something that I have not felt a ton in video games. Yeah. It's been a while.

34
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Yeah. A lot of these open world games that I enjoy are like, yeah, you get things done and maybe you beat a castle in a, or a, you know, a monastery in Assassin's Creed. And it's difficult. It can be. Yeah. But it's not hard. Yeah. It doesn't, it doesn't feel like, wow, I did that. Yeah. That second level. I fucking did that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it feels, yeah, achievement. That's so cool. Yeah. How about you?

35
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Uh, my bright spot, Dan, may sound counterintuitive, but I mean this wholeheartedly as a bright spot. Okay. My bright spot is failure. Oh. Uh, I, as you know. In a certain way, so was mine. Yeah. Well, I think that is kind of the, no, I think we share this. Uh, as you know, I started trying to stream a little bit of video games on Twitch. Yeah. And, uh, it has gone disastrous. People had asked what your channel is. I don't know if you gave the address. Oh, I haven't. It's, uh, it's Twitch TV, JB Holmes 3209.

36
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Okay. Yeah. That was the important thing. You get to find it. Sure. Well, there's that. I appreciate that not many people have found it because it has gone disastrously every time. Uh, the audio issues. It's a learning thing. Yeah. And it's, it's really, it's really fascinating cause it's fun to teach myself new stuff at 33. Like I've never touched the software on this before. I've never done all that stuff. It's fun to learn all the things that I'm terrible at and require new equipment for and all that stuff.

37
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:43,800
And it reminded me of when I started doing standup of just like I failed for two years straight and as I'm doing this, I was so frustrated because I couldn't figure it out properly and I felt like I was disappointing the people who actually came to see it and I was really grateful to them and I wanted to do a good job for them and I failed miserably.

38
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:59,800
And then I remembered I can fail so hard for so long and then eventually I got good at it to the point where I think I can do the same thing here. I mean, we failed quite a while doing this podcast. Totally, totally. Our streams did not always go.

39
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:14,800
And now I think maybe you're getting a greater appreciation for why I have such a difficult time with being like, yeah, let's get back to doing live stream. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't want, I have so many headaches. I get it. But I wish you luck with that. I know you'll get it figured out and it'll be great and people will have fun watching the streams.

40
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:26,800
I'm just excited because it also means that I'm trying new things, you know, and you can't expect to just be good out of the gate at new things. No, that's true. Yeah, it's been really good and humbling and I've appreciated it a lot.

41
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:39,800
This is your second level of Lovecraft's Untold Stories. Exactly what it is. Challenging, maybe unfair. That's a little unfairly hard. 33 year old people anymore aren't supposed to be able to use computers. I think that's the rule.

42
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:59,800
So Jordan, today we have an unexpected twist. Oh no. Alex is out of studio. No. On our last episode on Wednesday, I had said that today we were going to be listening to the end of Trump's presidency and inauguration day on Alex's show and I cannot deliver that.

43
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:15,800
And I'll explain why. First reason. Alex's fake last episode thing carried over into this episode. Oh no. No, because you knew that. Oh, of course. On our last episode, when we talked about the 17th, Alex was saying tomorrow will be my fake last episode. No, of course.

44
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:35,800
And so that was something that I couldn't not follow the thread of. Naturally. Then it turned out that on inauguration day, it was an all day affair. Right. So that's going to have to be on Monday. Okay. We're going to be covering January 20th on Monday. Today we're going to be talking about the 18th and the 19th, 2021. Blackjack. Blackjack, baby!

45
00:07:35,800 --> 00:08:04,800
No. End of show. No, baby. All right. And yeah, so we'll get to the inauguration on Monday. I just need a bit more time to prepare that because it's a lot of stuff to go through. A lot of disappointment. You don't have to listen to 12 hours. Well, I don't have to listen to all of it. Harrison Smith's hosting, I'm sure, a good bit of it. The Capitol has unfallen. Oh no. The Capitol is back in the arms of the globalists. Shit.

46
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:26,800
So before we get down to business on today's episode, though, where we witnessed the last proper shows of the Trump time. Yes, even though there's two of them. Yeah, the 18th and the 19th. Yes. The last days when Trump could do something weird while Alex is on air. Before we get down to that, though, let's take a moment to say thank you to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show. Oh, that's a great idea.

47
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:55,800
So first, Nathan S. Thank you so much. You're now Policy Wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Thank you, Nathan. Next, Disgruntled Honey Bee. Thank you so much. You are now Policy Wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Thank you very much. Disgruntled Honey Bee. Thank you. Next, Dave Endor's Donation Drive. Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Oh, that's a reference to my book, Dave Endor's Donation Drive. Oh, that's cute. Thank you. Thank you. Next, Nicholas L. and that's N-I-K-O-L-A-U-S. For my money, probably the best one.

48
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Thank you so much. You are now policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Thank you very much, Nicholas. Thank you next, Lee Green. Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Thanks, Lee Green.

50
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
I'm a policy wonk.

51
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Thank you, Kate.

52
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,800
They go. Next, Thomas B. Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk.

53
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
I'm a policy wonk.

54
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Thank you very much, Tommy B.

55
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,800
And 1-800-NW-HOGS. Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk.

56
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
I'm a policy wonk.

57
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Thank you very much, 1-800-NW-HOGS.

58
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,800
And finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on Elevated Love and we appreciate that very much.

59
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,800
So first, Derek and that's spelled D-A-R-R-I-C-K. It's my money, the second best way to spell Derek.

60
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
That's pretty great.

61
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
It's up there. Maybe it's the best. I don't know.

62
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
It's pretty up there.

63
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Thank you so much. You are now a technocrat.

64
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,800
And the Waffle Witch. Thank you so much. You are now a technocrat.

65
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
I'm a policy wonk.

66
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Crikey, mate. That's fantastic. Have yourself a brew.

67
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
How's your 401k doing, bro?

68
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
We gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

69
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Let's just get down to business. We ain't making that money off that heroin.

70
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Why you pimps so good?

71
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
My neck is freakishly large.

72
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,800
I declare info war on you.

73
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Thank you so much, Derek, and thank you so much to the Waffle Witch.

74
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

75
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,800
You know, a way you can blow people's minds is waffles.

76
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Yes, that's true.

77
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
People don't realize how easy they are to make.

78
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
They're delicious, too.

79
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,800
And they're so cheap. Like, make a waffle iron.

80
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Yeah.

81
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
Five bucks, probably.

82
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Also, Waffle Witch should be in a Miyazaki movie, if not already.

83
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
And I would pay a lot to see it.

84
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,800
I might have to fight the Waffle Witch and love her kinds of untold stories.

85
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,800
That's level four. Super unfair.

86
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,800
So, Jordan, here's an out of context drop from today's show.

87
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
I'm at war with these people, not just on air.

88
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
I'm constantly fighting them, and I'm not special.

89
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
I'm just not dead inside.

90
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,800
I will never let you eat Satan get me.

91
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

92
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,800
He always sounds exactly like the people that he says are demons.

93
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

94
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Yeah, yeah.

95
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
I just, you know, I don't know.

96
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
It's hard to take someone seriously when they're like,

97
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
I'm fighting the demons all the time.

98
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Yes, all the time.

99
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Yeah.

100
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
All the time.

101
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Yeah.

102
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Nonstop.

103
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
A little silly.

104
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Nonstop.

105
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
My wife gets to go play tennis with her instructor,

106
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
and I'm out here fighting demons all the time.

107
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Yeah.

108
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
It's brutal.

109
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
It's not fair.

110
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Yeah.

111
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
So we start on the 18th, and of course, on the 17th,

112
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Alex had decided he was going to do his last show.

113
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Sure.

114
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Which he, again, already did last November.

115
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Right.

116
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,800
This is between his third and fifth last show.

117
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
Somewhere in that range.

118
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,800
He decided on Saturday that he was going to do the last broadcast

119
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
as he was in the middle of a show.

120
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,800
So him and Mike Adams did a very dramatic show.

121
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Oh, yeah.

122
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
I assume Mike Adams can never come back on.

123
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
He was on the last broadcast.

124
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
I mean, for good taste's sake, he can't.

125
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

126
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
He already gave his farewell address.

127
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,800
So on that Saturday, Alex got distracted by Robert Barnes,

128
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,800
the lawyer extraordinaire, coming in to yell about QAnon.

129
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Sure.

130
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
And then Alex realized, like,

131
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
ah, I can't do it today.

132
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
I'm going to do it tomorrow.

133
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
So on Sunday, he came in, did not do it.

134
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Went hot for it.

135
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Decided to point the finger at the Boogaloo Boys.

136
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Right.

137
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
For the Capitol storming.

138
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Well, you got to do something.

139
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
And then he's like, ah, I can't handle it.

140
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
I'll do it tomorrow.

141
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,800
So the 18th, Monday, is in theory supposed to be the last show.

142
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
The last show ever.

143
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Right.

144
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
The final broadcast.

145
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
Great.

146
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Yeah.

147
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
We're doing it.

148
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Here's where we start.

149
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,800
New Jersey, where they tried to bankrupt that big successful gym,

150
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,800
and they were starting to win in court.

151
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,800
So the state just seized $150,000 every dime the company had to pay payroll

152
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,800
and to pay for the bill on the building and to pay for the insurance.

153
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
They barely had enough money to stay open,

154
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
and now they're going to have to close.

155
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,800
But they're starting to get cash donations.

156
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,800
And all they got to do is call themselves a church or BLM,

157
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
then they'll be protected under the First Amendment.

158
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,800
And all of us should say, we're part of the Church of Freedom.

159
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,800
In fact, I really think I'm going to incorporate a church.

160
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,800
All I got to do is believe in freedom and a pro-human future,

161
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
and you can be part of it.

162
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Okay.

163
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
That was inevitable.

164
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Yeah.

165
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Yeah.

166
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
It was about time.

167
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Honestly, this has taken too long to go full cult.

168
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Basically.

169
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Yeah.

170
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
This is a church.

171
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Yeah.

172
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Why not?

173
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Yeah.

174
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
No, I've literally shit all over the Satanists for not having a church,

175
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,800
and they shouldn't have the protections of the First Amendment.

176
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
But...

177
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,800
He really screwed up not doing this when Trump was in office.

178
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Totally.

179
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Because Trump wasn't going to prosecute churches for 501c3 violations,

180
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
but that might change.

181
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,800
That might go back now to where you can't do political organizing

182
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
in the guise of a church.

183
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
I very much doubt it.

184
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,800
So yeah, Alex doesn't want to pay taxes.

185
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
No.

186
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
That's basically the game here.

187
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Yeah.

188
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
And yeah, finally getting around to it.

189
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
I'm going to make a church.

190
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
You're already a church.

191
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,800
I don't know why Wesley Snipes never did the Church of Blade,

192
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
because I would have joined the Church of Blade.

193
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Sure.

194
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
I don't know how Alex isn't already a church.

195
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
That's a good point.

196
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
He constantly talks about God,

197
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,800
and this show is a deeply religious thing where he thinks he's fighting demons all day.

198
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
I don't know.

199
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,800
It's either science fiction or religion, one of the two.

200
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,800
Both of which could be a church.

201
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Because it ain't news and it ain't politics.

202
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Hey, if Elrond can do it.

203
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,800
So Jordan, I don't know if you know this, but America is dead.

204
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Fair.

205
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
It didn't die on the inauguration.

206
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Oh, that's good.

207
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
And that's only because Alex misspeaks.

208
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Okay.

209
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,800
You can definitely put on the tombstone,

210
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
the United States of America,

211
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,800
born July 4th, 1776.

212
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Not true.

213
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Died of treason.

214
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Died of infiltration.

215
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,800
Died of Satanism.

216
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
January 21st.

217
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
The year 2020.

218
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Whoops.

219
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Still writing July on my checks.

220
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
Wow, still writing July on those checks.

221
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Man.

222
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
So I guess America's been dead for a year.

223
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,800
And see, this is why you gotta double check before you put the death date on the tombstone.

224
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Yeah, of course.

225
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Because that's in rock.

226
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Yeah.

227
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,800
America died before Bernie had to drop out of the race.

228
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Yeah.

229
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,800
We couldn't even get a real socialist to kill America.

230
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,800
I know that you were taking issue with him saying, you know, America was born July 4th, 1776.

231
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Sure.

232
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
And I don't want to parse that right now.

233
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
I have no interest in parsing that ever.

234
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,800
What I do want to talk about is that this seems to imply that Alex doesn't believe that life begins at conception.

235
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:44,800
It seems to me that this is an indication that birth is when life begins.

236
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
If you're pro-nation, you're pro-choice.

237
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
I think that's the reality.

238
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Or else you have to celebrate the Independence Day, the day when someone came up with the idea to have a country.

239
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Yeah.

240
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,800
1617, somebody was like, man, I think we can do it.

241
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Yeah.

242
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Or maybe a thousand years before that, Eric the Red is out here.

243
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Man, I think these states should be united.

244
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Or just even the day that the beginning of the protesting against the crown began in the colonies.

245
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Then, I don't know.

246
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Anyway, I just thought that was kind of funny.

247
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,800
America wasn't born when it became a twinkle in the eye of some revolutionary.

248
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
I might have been fairly bored by Alex at the beginning of this episode.

249
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Sure, sure.

250
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
And so I was having thoughts like that.

251
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Sure, you're having fun thoughts.

252
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Yeah.

253
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,800
So Alex decides to talk about the One Ring.

254
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
That's good.

255
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
Sure.

256
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Yeah.

257
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,800
The globalists, apparently they all want power in the rings that Sauron makes.

258
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Naturally.

259
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Give power to the ten kings with the ten rings.

260
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Nine rings.

261
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Whatever.

262
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
But there's one to rule them.

263
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
So that's the ten.

264
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Well, yes.

265
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
But there's three for the elven lords.

266
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Right.

267
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Seven for the dwarf lords.

268
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
I understand.

269
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Okay.

270
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Alex gives himself chills talking about this.

271
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Okay, okay.

272
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,800
And so the globalist AI system is the enemy that is parasitically sucking the U.S. dry.

273
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,800
And there's only a competition with globalists about who gets the AI takeover.

274
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,800
It'll be China's AI or the U.S. AI, but it's Satan's plan that it's really all the same

275
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
AI.

276
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
The Lord of the Rings allegory.

277
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Ten rings given to ten kings of the earth who above all seek power.

278
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
It's a Christian allegory.

279
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Tolkien said this about what he experienced.

280
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
He specifically said it was not.

281
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,500
A professor at the highest levels of the insider knowledge.

282
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Went out of his way.

283
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,320
And so ten rings are given to ten kings for power.

284
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,860
But when they take the power, they actually become enslaved.

285
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,260
And there's one secret ring that controls them all.

286
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,260
That's Satan.

287
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,340
Not secret.

288
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,300
That's a spiritual element.

289
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:50,800
So, he's got chills.

290
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,760
I believe it's nine rings given to mortal men.

291
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,720
Doomed to die.

292
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,760
Literally in the poem.

293
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Yeah.

294
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,760
You make a good point about Tolkien really resisting allegory as well.

295
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
Went hard on it.

296
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,560
People were like, it's about the nuclear bomb, right?

297
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,760
And he was like, oh, that's interesting.

298
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,760
No.

299
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,760
Yeah.

300
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,400
He did say that it was a religious story.

301
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
You know, it was a Christian story.

302
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Sure.

303
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,840
Unintentionally at first and then intentionally upon reflection.

304
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,000
Who's Jesus' hobbit friends?

305
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,920
Who's Jesus' pippin?

306
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
Pippin?

307
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,640
That would be Bartholomew.

308
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,760
I think that's a good answer.

309
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Yeah.

310
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,080
I just love it anytime Alex is talking and he impresses himself or he freaks himself

311
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
out.

312
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
Ooh, got chills.

313
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
Oh, man.

314
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
Ooh.

315
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,080
I nailed that.

316
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,080
I absolutely got that one perfect.

317
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
One ring?

318
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
Satan.

319
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
Yeah.

320
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
Solved that problem.

321
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,120
And there's still going on about how there's in the riot at the Capitol before the storming

322
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,200
of January 6th, there were agents.

323
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Sure.

324
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Right?

325
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,840
Everybody who might be inconvenient for him.

326
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,840
Right.

327
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,840
Probably an agent.

328
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,840
That's Aragorn.

329
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,840
But he can tell.

330
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Alex can tell.

331
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
Sure.

332
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,840
He has a special sense for this.

333
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,320
I mean, you've got FBI agents in there running this damn thing.

334
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,200
God, we're in so much trouble.

335
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,480
And again, I'm not saying those guys, the agents, the guys with the Black Lives Matter

336
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,480
and the Antifa shirts, it's the video you showed later of the people in full camo and

337
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,760
full mask that are definitely got squared away there.

338
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,280
And I can just tell you learn things, just look at them instantly.

339
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,400
You know what's going on.

340
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,280
This just makes me think of the time that we spent listening to the immediate aftermath

341
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
of the Boston bombing.

342
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,280
Yeah, totally.

343
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,720
Whenever Alex was like, I can tell who everybody is just by looking at them.

344
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Yeah.

345
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,480
Just by looking at the way they're standing and I know this guy's hostage rescue team

346
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
all over.

347
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,480
Yeah.

348
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
You don't know shit.

349
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
Here's my...

350
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,040
I think Alex proves that the blood of Numenor has grown thin.

351
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Come on, man.

352
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
All right.

353
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
How many more do I got?

354
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,640
I think you got way more, but I don't know how much patience I got.

355
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
You don't want any more?

356
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
No.

357
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Blackjack.

358
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Oh boy.

359
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,640
Okay.

360
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,240
So yeah, I mean, the people that he's talking about, I think, I don't know what the video

361
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,480
he's referring to, but I assume based on the descriptions, probably the Oathkeeper folks

362
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,480
who were there.

363
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
Yeah, it has to.

364
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
Yeah.

365
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,080
But now it would be as good a time as any to talk about how Joe Biggs, former Infor's

366
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,120
employee, Rambo Joe Biggs, he going to prison.

367
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Yeah.

368
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
Hilarious.

369
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,200
He's going to prison hard.

370
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
For a while.

371
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Yeah.

372
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,840
Unless he flips on a lot of more important people.

373
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
And I don't even know.

374
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,120
I don't even know if that's going to do much.

375
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,120
I doubt it.

376
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
Who's more important than him?

377
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,000
He's like second in command of the Proud Boys.

378
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,280
Yeah, that one's pretty easy to pick out.

379
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
I don't know.

380
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:50,560
What if he, I mean, I assume he can flip on some congressmen on account of them committing

381
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,560
the crimes.

382
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,560
Yeah.

383
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
I don't know.

384
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Yeah.

385
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,440
I don't know what he knows or what he's up to, but it's interesting to see this path

386
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,280
that he's gone from.

387
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,280
Ding dong working at Infowars trying to get Pizzagate going to the guy who gets Ted Cruz

388
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,240
to finally go to prison.

389
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,440
It's an interesting path.

390
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,800
Also just before we got on air here today, on air, what the fuck am I talking about?

391
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
No idea.

392
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,320
Before we got on these mics, there was a news story that was breaking about William Watson,

393
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:29,120
who's a guy who had a big beard, was pictured at the Capitol with, along with Q shaman.

394
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,340
And a lot of the headlines were really stressing that he went to the Capitol because Alex told

395
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,340
him to.

396
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,340
Sure.

397
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,240
Because people are making more out of that than they should.

398
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't think you can do much with that.

399
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
No.

400
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,200
I mean like, but I saw some people tweeting things to the effect of like, Alex ordered

401
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
him to go.

402
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Sure.

403
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,640
And even the Raw Story article about it, the phrasing of it was a little bit iffy.

404
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,640
Yeah.

405
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,480
Because as far as I can tell from the actual information, he just said that he knew that

406
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,960
there was a rally at the Capitol because Alex had said, meet there at one, which you got

407
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:10,160
to assume is Alex wanting people to go to the stage that he was conceivably going to

408
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,880
be having a rally at.

409
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,800
It would be nice, and we've referenced this before, it would be nice if before people

410
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,720
ran with stories, they would at least like send you an email.

411
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,960
But I mean, I imagine that the reason they don't is because you would be like, hey, could

412
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
you add more nuance?

413
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,080
And they'd be like, more nuance means fewer clicks, so we're not going to talk to Dan.

414
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
Yeah.

415
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,280
I mean, I don't know if I could even be of much help with this, but I wish people would

416
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,260
recognize that like the more you put Alex in the crosshairs for this, when it's something

417
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:42,440
like what you see in those stories about this guy, the more it works in Alex's favor.

418
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,800
They're trying to set me up for this.

419
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,840
And yeah, you shouldn't do things like that.

420
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,680
They play into his- No, you wind up not just letting him off

421
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,480
the hook, but doing a, I would call it pulling a Rogan, where you accidentally give him more

422
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,700
credibility than he by any means deserves.

423
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,360
You also write him a new narrative.

424
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Yeah.

425
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:10,800
I mean, really, this is like a Son of Sam kind of stuff where it's like, oh, you can't

426
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,480
blame the dog.

427
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
You know what I'm saying?

428
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
Or was that him?

429
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Yeah.

430
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,640
I'm pretty sure the dog who was in, yeah, Satan and stuff.

431
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
Yeah.

432
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
Yeah.

433
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
Alex is just Satan for this guy.

434
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,640
No.

435
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,640
The ring is Satan.

436
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Ah, that's fair.

437
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,540
So I hated the beginning of this show.

438
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,120
It was very boring.

439
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,520
There was nothing going on.

440
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,080
And thankfully, about an hour in, hour and 10, and Alex condenses what he's been talking

441
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,240
about for the last hour.

442
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Okay, good.

443
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,480
The whole last hour could have been condensed into two minutes.

444
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,080
It's confirmed- The Alex Jones story.

445
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:51,840
The deep state ran the Boogaloo boys via the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL and the FBI.

446
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
No.

447
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
You're back.

448
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
To protect the Capitol.

449
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,880
They've all bragged about it with Antifa.

450
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,880
They've been protected.

451
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,380
When they were arrested, they were released.

452
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,140
It's been confirmed, apparently.

453
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:07,680
That is a fair condensing of most of what he spent all of his time talking about.

454
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,680
But he didn't prove any of this.

455
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,340
He hasn't confirmed any of it.

456
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:16,280
He just believes that saying something repeatedly is the same thing as confirming it.

457
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,560
Hey, how about this?

458
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:22,280
How about fuck your William Watson article, and instead, here's your article.

459
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,060
Alex doesn't get to do this.

460
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:30,600
And all you do is go through what he did on the sixth, and how he lied about it immediately,

461
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,040
and how he's lying about it now, and how we don't get to let this go.

462
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:38,300
He doesn't get to go on and talk about how there's going to be problems, and everybody's

463
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,060
going to have their balls caught off.

464
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:46,080
He has to say, I lied to you, and I was full of shit, and everybody should write an article

465
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,260
about that.

466
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,360
And also, there's a written article that in the lead mentions that he believes he's constantly

467
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
fighting demons.

468
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,360
And he believes he's constantly fighting demons.

469
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,360
Yes.

470
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,460
So he had the FBI, and through the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL, they were

471
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,920
running the Boogaloo Boys to do all this and get the storming going.

472
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,980
Weird, they were buddies.

473
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,000
And then you had QAnon people who were patsies, apparently.

474
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,420
They were just there to be a spectacle.

475
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,400
And we walked right into a trap.

476
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
They did stand down.

477
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,040
They ushered the Q people, who were not violent, in to be killed and in to be arrested as sacrificial

478
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,260
dummies, just like in Spies Like Us, a great comedy, but very accurate.

479
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,940
You're like, oh, we're going to accelerate you guys to be frontline spies.

480
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,940
You did that.

481
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,940
With like two weeks training, yeah.

482
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,940
You did that.

483
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,940
And they put them in as decoys.

484
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,860
Of course, they ended up doing a better job than the actual spies, which is how it actually

485
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,860
works.

486
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,100
Because real people get real stuff done, not you mentally ill sicko freaks that have Asperger's

487
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,100
or whatever.

488
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,100
Satanic Asperger's.

489
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,100
I don't mean Asperger's or Satanic.

490
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,100
I mean a form of it that's like Satanic.

491
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,180
Disgusting.

492
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,700
That was weird.

493
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,420
So then you're saying that they did it.

494
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,420
I don't know.

495
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,820
He's saying that the real people at the Patriots did everything.

496
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,380
I think he watched Spies Like Us recently.

497
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,620
I think maybe his kids are coming to such an age that you've got to get into some of

498
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,620
those classic comedies.

499
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,620
That's fair.

500
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,620
That's fair.

501
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,620
Yeah.

502
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,700
So I think one of the things that I'm noticing about Alex around this time is that it's pretty

503
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,620
much just, it's very Doom filled.

504
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,780
It's very much the country is no more.

505
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,220
Well, I mean, in his cosmology, the devil has taken over the United States.

506
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,980
So you would expect that kind of thing.

507
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,980
Yeah.

508
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,100
But you would expect it to be in that language.

509
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,660
The devil is in charge.

510
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,660
Well, yeah.

511
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,220
He's been yelling about it for a long time.

512
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,220
Yeah.

513
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,280
But instead it kind of comes in this form and it's like, this is just going to incite

514
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,780
people to impotent violence.

515
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,340
We're going to come back and talk more about what you're witnessing there in our former

516
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,300
Capitol now under globalist control.

517
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,220
We are now officially occupied.

518
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:58,820
Joe Biden will be installed in about 46 hours as the first dictator of the United States.

519
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,820
Okay.

520
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,300
And then we'll all be shut down after that.

521
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,380
Shouldn't he think FDR was the first dictator of the United States?

522
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,140
I managed to avoid a spit take.

523
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,140
Yeah.

524
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,140
I appreciate that.

525
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,540
That was going to go straight at you.

526
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,540
Yeah.

527
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,900
That doesn't even fit with his own ideas.

528
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
No, no.

529
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,620
But DC is the former Capitol.

530
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,900
We're now under complete occupation.

531
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,900
Biden is a dictator.

532
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,900
Naturally.

533
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:26,540
It's all like, okay, well, what has your show for 25 fucking years suggested people do when

534
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,380
those circumstances are achieved?

535
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,380
Yeah.

536
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,860
Well, I think you know.

537
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,860
Yeah.

538
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,300
So there's a couple of days left for Trump to be in office.

539
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,300
Sure.

540
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,620
He's got criminals to say you can go free.

541
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,740
Well, actually, Alex has a prediction about that.

542
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,740
Oh, strange.

543
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:47,340
And I think with this type of action, Trump is going to pardon Julian Assange tomorrow.

544
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,620
I'm predicting that right now.

545
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,660
My gut tells me that Trump's good and the Trump at the final crucible do the right thing.

546
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,020
Ooh, snake eyes came up just short on my prediction note.

547
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,340
Headline, you don't get to do this.

548
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,540
Alex, probably very disappointed about that.

549
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,540
Yeah.

550
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,540
Yeah.

551
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,540
Why did he think that would happen?

552
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,540
I don't know.

553
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,780
Probably because it's what his audience wants to hear.

554
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,780
Well, that's fair.

555
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:16,380
So Alex is getting, we heard on that Sunday show, he's getting back into the migrant caravan

556
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,820
fear based narratives.

557
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,820
Naturally.

558
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,820
Naturally.

559
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,140
And one of the things that I've noticed about him is he has an absolute inability to estimate

560
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,500
sizes of groups.

561
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Yeah.

562
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
Yeah.

563
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,420
He will say like 100,000 people is 10 million.

564
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

565
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,640
You ever do those, how many gumballs in this jar?

566
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,660
He guesses a million every time.

567
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,660
Or seven.

568
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,660
Yeah.

569
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,780
He's not good at estimating.

570
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,780
No, no, no.

571
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:47,020
He's saying, he's looking at a picture of like a caravan of migrants and he's just like,

572
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,580
oh, that's so many more people.

573
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,100
And if you don't admit it's the end of America, it will be.

574
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,940
By admitting we're under attack, by admitting this is globalist, by admitting that they've

575
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,860
collapsed the third world with the COVID lockdowns and now the UN has set up giant refugee centers

576
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:05,500
to make the hundreds of thousands that caravan here a few years ago that Trump stopped look

577
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,020
like insignificant.

578
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:13,180
Let's go ahead for radio listeners, any viewers can see this, roll that little newscast about

579
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,100
the 7,000 folks that is the 7,000.

580
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,160
Let me give you a newsflash.

581
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,500
It's 50,000.

582
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,420
I've seen the footage and that's just the first group, the UN trains, they've got debit

583
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,820
cards paid for by the state department.

584
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,220
Trump cut off the money, but now they do it directly from Soros and I'm gonna go to your

585
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,980
phone calls, but that's what's happening.

586
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,980
Prove it.

587
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,980
Prove any of that shit.

588
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,500
Anyway, look, I noticed this and I hate it.

589
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:46,420
It sucks, but I think that these sorts of stories really get under Alex's skin more

590
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:52,940
than a lot of other ones because he gets really mad for a large chunk of this episode.

591
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,100
Al, the border's close to his home and he's a racist.

592
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,260
The end.

593
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:06,020
He's really, really like just down and like he freaks out quite a bit.

594
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,980
And that does get- Might have to see two more Muslims than I'm

595
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,980
used to.

596
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,980
At the pool supply shop.

597
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,980
Yeah, exactly.

598
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,980
Yeah.

599
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,820
So he addresses the idea that this was gonna be his last show and then he just goes downhill

600
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,820
from there.

601
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,820
Okay.

602
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,820
All right.

603
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,820
All right.

604
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,820
I'm gonna go to break and I promise for at least four segments, three segments, I'm gonna

605
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,820
go write the calls.

606
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:28,540
I'm gonna go to Michael, Steve, John, Christian, Houston, Scott, Preston, Izzy, Richard and

607
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,540
others.

608
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,820
And listen, I want to explain something here to everybody.

609
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,820
Okay?

610
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,780
It might seem really irritable and mad it's not with the crew.

611
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,940
I'm just done with all this.

612
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:44,180
And I meant to come here today and say this is my last broadcast.

613
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,020
And by that, I'm gonna keep doing shows.

614
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,340
But I mean, you understand folks, I believe they're gonna shut everything down the next

615
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,340
few months.

616
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,500
They're gonna blow up federal buildings.

617
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,700
They're gonna put poison in water supplies.

618
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,700
I mean, it's over.

619
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,460
I mean, it's over.

620
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,460
You understand?

621
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,180
Your only shot you've got is realizing that we're screwed.

622
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,220
Your candy ass church isn't gonna do it.

623
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,020
Your candy ass boss isn't gonna do it.

624
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,100
We're a trained group of monkeys in this country.

625
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,740
We're not what Americans used to be.

626
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,220
We're not rugged individualists.

627
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,540
We don't stand up for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.

628
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,120
We're a joke, okay?

629
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,420
So he's in a bad mood.

630
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,420
Yeah.

631
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:22,260
That bad mood has started after covering this story about the migrants.

632
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,260
Yeah.

633
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,140
And it turns pretty fucking extreme.

634
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,780
I mean, he's talking about blowing up federal buildings, poisoning the water supply and

635
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,780
like...

636
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,820
I don't think even Stone Cold called churches candy asses.

637
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,500
No, and it was The Rock who called people candy asses.

638
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,500
Oh, I apologize.

639
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,900
I apologize for not getting famous Republican The Rock.

640
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,660
You did speak at the RNC.

641
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,220
Yeah, exactly.

642
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,620
Yeah, so Alex goes from there, how they're gonna do all this shit.

643
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,620
Yeah, we're all just gonna let The Rock get away with that, right?

644
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,140
Everybody's just agreed, like, eh, don't worry about it.

645
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,740
Sure, The Rock endorsed all of the horrifying things, but we'll still let him be a movie

646
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,740
star.

647
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,260
I mean, sure, I don't know what his politics are anymore.

648
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,260
Sure.

649
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,260
And I don't know what...

650
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,260
I don't know how...

651
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,660
Look, Vince McMahon is a lunatic.

652
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,260
Yeah, that's true.

653
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,260
That is true.

654
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,260
That's all...

655
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,260
I don't know.

656
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,900
I'm not gonna sit here and defend The Rock, but I'm also not gonna say that I know.

657
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
I'm not gonna?

658
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,700
He did speak at the RNC, but that was also 20 years ago?

659
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,980
Eh, that's fair.

660
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:28,780
Anyway, Alex gets deeper into Doom fantasies.

661
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,340
I mean, if we ever beat this thing, it'll be in the history of, like, these people were

662
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,340
Hitler.

663
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
I mean, this is unbelievable.

664
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:40,060
It's not like, oh, we're getting there, it's bad, things are out of control.

665
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,060
It's...

666
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,500
They've just begun.

667
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,040
They're gonna take your pension funds.

668
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
They're gonna bankrupt.

669
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,160
They're gonna cut the power off, the oil off.

670
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,380
They're gonna open the borders.

671
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,700
It's over, man.

672
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,700
It's over.

673
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,700
It's all gone.

674
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,700
It's all over.

675
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,420
They're gonna activate the Boogaloos, FBI, ADL, terror forces.

676
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,940
They're gonna start blowing everything up.

677
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,060
Then they're gonna come arrest all the patriots.

678
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,060
The idiots will cheer it.

679
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,140
Then they're gonna shut your power off.

680
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,780
They want you starving in the street.

681
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,780
They wanna rape your wife.

682
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,780
They're Bolsheviks.

683
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,780
They're Jacobins.

684
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,780
You're...

685
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,780
I wish.

686
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,780
It's all over, man.

687
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
All over.

688
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,780
Enjoy.

689
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,780
All your games.

690
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,260
In fact, America is rotting and deserves it.

691
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,540
Now, the Satanists aren't good.

692
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
They're not God.

693
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,740
God just lets them have their way now.

694
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,020
So all your games are over.

695
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,700
All the TV watching, all the laziness, all the slack-jawing's over.

696
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,700
It's over.

697
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:35,500
You're gonna be just like a baby at six months being chopped up in its mother's womb.

698
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,500
You're not a human.

699
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
You're not essential.

700
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,500
You're dead.

701
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,940
They're gonna kill you, because you don't care.

702
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,220
There's so much hand sanitizer on the market, but beware.

703
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,220
So...

704
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:53,240
Yeah, that was a jarring shift into that commercial.

705
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,240
Never not fun.

706
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,700
Yeah, so I guess we should not storm capital buildings then if we're all, you know...

707
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,260
I don't understand.

708
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:12,000
If I recall correctly, I do believe that Alex said God appointed him to defeat Satan.

709
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,780
And he was the only person that Satan was worried about.

710
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:19,980
Yeah, and that's why Satan tried to recruit him when he was younger with all the hot cheerleaders.

711
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,860
So I mean, now that he's done, I assume Satan's like, whew, dodged a bullet on that one.

712
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,780
I guess God isn't that powerful now, is he?

713
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,540
Well, look, don't blame God for Alex's failures.

714
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,280
I'm pretty sure that that's the only person you can blame.

715
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,540
This is an HR issue.

716
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,220
His prophecies are shit.

717
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,620
I don't believe God at all anymore, Dan.

718
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:45,060
I do think that if you take everything Alex says seriously, then yes, he has been defeated

719
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,140
by the devil at this point.

720
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,340
And by extension, so has God.

721
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:55,700
Yeah, but also I could see a world where God is sitting off at the side, he's like, I didn't

722
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,700
tell you to do that.

723
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,180
Nah, I can see that world too.

724
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,980
Hey, Alex, don't keep my name out of your mouth.

725
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,300
I didn't tell you to do anything.

726
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,780
Hey, buddy, pssst, guess who you've been working for the whole time, you idiot?

727
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,900
Yeah, yeah.

728
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,740
You're controlled opposition for the devil.

729
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,420
Alex Jones is a devil of false flag.

730
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,300
Yeah, that does sound right.

731
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:22,940
So Alex believes that everyone in the news, like all over MSM, sure.

732
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,580
Everyone's calling for Trump people to be thrown in camps, Trump fans, just people who

733
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,580
like him.

734
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:35,500
What kind of people who bad ones like, like offsite FEMA, FEMA, all right.

735
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,460
Five years ago, if we had one club of national TV saying, let's put people in reeducation

736
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:45,260
camps, we'd be airing in every segment, I probably saw five clips this morning of national

737
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:51,340
news saying, when you do arrest all supporters and reeducate them right now for no reason.

738
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:56,860
You said if you had one clip, we need emergency legislation, we need the States lining up

739
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,860
against this.

740
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,900
We need all the big churches coming out against it.

741
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,920
We need all the men that I see on the golf courses are polishing their Porsches or their

742
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,080
jet boats to spend some time caring about this.

743
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,080
Don't you have boats?

744
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:17,060
All the successful men keep their heads down and it makes me sick because you're not successful.

745
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,780
You're the ones that took our birthright and crapped it away.

746
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,860
That's why I'm pissed, man.

747
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,520
I'm really pissed off right now.

748
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,640
We got a case of communist cancer.

749
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,820
So again, Alex is furious that rich people aren't doing more to support the info war

750
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,820
or something.

751
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,820
I think you can read between the lines a little bit on that.

752
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,820
Yeah.

753
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,420
We've heard this chorus before.

754
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:47,140
I do think that this is him trying to do like a posterity last broadcast, like the fake

755
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,140
last broadcast thing.

756
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,140
He's getting really mad.

757
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,660
He's trying to get his Howard Beale moment.

758
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,380
Mad as hell, not going to take it anymore.

759
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,380
Never.

760
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,380
Kind of thing.

761
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,580
And it's really funny because he starts time traveling.

762
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,100
His mind starts traveling through time.

763
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,380
He brings out a story from 2008 and pretends it's current.

764
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,380
I'm excited.

765
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,820
I mean, this is it, folks.

766
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,060
I start thinking about all the things I want to say and all the things I want to do and

767
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:17,100
it just makes me mad that our precious country is being literally sucked into a black hole

768
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,900
of world government.

769
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,700
Literally.

770
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,700
God.

771
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:34,020
You understand they are announcing shock collars and shock bracelets and bracelets and dog

772
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,620
collars for everyone to wear, OK?

773
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:41,020
I mean, I have the newscast from 2008.

774
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:46,020
The plan is they're going to be shocking callers, but it was, oh, you're wearing a collar now

775
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,220
to show your COVID thing and attracts you and social businesses.

776
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,220
No, no, no.

777
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,940
The actual meetings are about having a shocker in it and the public's like, I love my shocker.

778
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,940
I'm not joking.

779
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:01,380
No, but you're talking about a 13 year old news story about something that the DHS was

780
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,520
considering and didn't implement.

781
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,520
There is that.

782
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,420
This is so sad.

783
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,420
There is that.

784
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,420
Yeah.

785
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,420
That might be an issue.

786
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,620
And I actually know that that's exactly what he's talking about, because we heard him talk

787
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,860
about that in the past episodes.

788
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,860
And...

789
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,500
No, the problem is, Dan, liberals don't have any memories.

790
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
Right.

791
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,940
But I also heard him bring it up on this episode.

792
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,940
Sure.

793
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,300
This same episode, he talks about how they were going to do that for anti-terrorism in

794
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,300
2008.

795
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,300
I hate it.

796
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,460
And he remembers it and then he incorporates it into the present narrative.

797
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,460
I hate him so much.

798
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,460
Yeah, he's the worst.

799
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,460
Yeah.

800
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,580
And there's some content warning, I guess, about this.

801
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,500
This next clip is pretty gross, but it's Alex freaking out.

802
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,560
He's now super mad.

803
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,520
He's losing his mind, starts complaining more about shock collars.

804
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,140
Are they shock collars like what we're used to, or are they collars that just explain

805
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,940
what is happening with climate change?

806
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:57,680
They're shocking collars in the sense that they are, like, garish.

807
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
They're collars that are just...

808
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
They're bedazzled.

809
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,680
Yes.

810
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
They're like, ooh, you can't wear that.

811
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,500
They're like slap bracelets and people are shocked you're still wearing them.

812
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Yeah.

813
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,500
Gotcha.

814
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,700
So, there's more talk about shock collars here, and then Alex brings in a little bit

815
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:14,420
of his fears and disgusting stuff about drag queen story time.

816
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,420
Oh, God.

817
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,420
Which is...

818
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,420
You don't get to do this!

819
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:21,300
It's been a while, and this ends predictably.

820
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:26,460
Not communist China, Homeland Security is having meetings about shockers you wear around

821
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,460
your neck.

822
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,460
13 years ago.

823
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:34,300
I mean, hell, you let convicted pedophiles go to elementary schools and have your six-year-old

824
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,660
daughters and sons bounce up and down on their erections.

825
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,420
I mean, literally, I watch these videos.

826
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,740
We can't even air these on air.

827
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:47,540
I can't even look at them of some fat pot-bellied dude with a little six-year-old girl on him

828
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,980
riding his crotch, and he's got an erection.

829
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,340
This is what they do on TV.

830
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,060
And then they cut to the local newscaster and he goes, well, got to get them when they're

831
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,060
young.

832
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,060
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

833
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,060
See, he's the leader.

834
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,060
He just goes along with it.

835
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,180
Got to get the children when they're young, huh?

836
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:05,620
Do you think you're safe in a world where they got kids with pedophiles on TV?

837
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:11,660
Do you think you're safe, you dumb son of a bitch?

838
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,100
Hmm, maybe.

839
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,420
You think they're safe when they're...

840
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,860
Now we know the COVID vaccine kills old people at a very high percentage rate.

841
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,300
You think we're safe when they're killing all the old people?

842
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:27,860
And do you think God likes us when we do that?

843
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,980
It's all going to burn.

844
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,840
All of you that think you're smart and you're part of the system is you can manipulate those

845
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,840
under you.

846
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,820
It's all going to come back on you a trillion fold.

847
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:43,780
And I'm just saying right now, I will not be part of this.

848
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,740
I will not submit to it.

849
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:52,060
You know, simply safe sells a social distancing sweater.

850
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:57,380
All right, I said I'd go to your calls.

851
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,460
Show them the Homeland Security video where you wear taser bracelets.

852
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,340
I'm not making this up, folks.

853
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,780
I know I'm saying this stuff.

854
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,140
It just sounds fantastic.

855
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,020
I'm not lying.

856
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,980
Is there a solution to hijacking?

857
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,300
Yes, everyone will wear a shocking bracelet, Homeland Security says.

858
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,300
It's okay.

859
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,180
Only if you're bad will the stir to shock you.

860
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

861
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:25,500
The flight attendant, don't put me in a reeducation center.

862
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
Put them in a reeducation center.

863
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,500
Okay.

864
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,580
I'm going to just say this and go to a call.

865
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:35,340
It could be your last chance to get an Infowars t-shirt, a Trader Joe's t-shirt, shows his

866
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:39,220
countries he's sold out to, to be your last chance to get X2, X3.

867
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:45,720
Wow, that really just really drives home the sincerity of that entire rant, like really

868
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,780
feels genuine and organic and real.

869
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,620
You don't get to do this!

870
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:55,120
It doesn't feel like a performance at all meant to heighten people's emotions, put them

871
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:00,540
in a suggestible state, wherein they might be like, oh no, I got to buy this t-shirt.

872
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,420
You know, I think this is why I really don't care.

873
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,780
Like I've seen a lot of like, a lot of those takes where it's like, no, you need to feel

874
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,820
for the Q people.

875
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,800
They really believe this is real and that, and that's why, you know, I know you don't

876
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,260
think that they should, and it's like, man, I get it.

877
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,660
I get it.

878
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:23,700
I care because a child believes that the boogeyman is under the bed.

879
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,700
I care.

880
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,700
If I'm going to be held as a child, I'm going to do, I'm going to be like, hey, no, there's

881
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,980
no boogeyman under the bed.

882
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,200
Let's do this.

883
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
You're an adult.

884
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
I don't care.

885
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,100
I don't care if you believe that the boogeyman is under the bed.

886
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,300
I just don't care.

887
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,240
You're an adult.

888
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,140
Many of you people are middle-aged or older.

889
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,380
Stop believing that there's a boogeyman under the bed.

890
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,820
Yeah, but you're not taking into account nearly enough how belief that there's a boogeyman

891
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:52,820
under your bed gives you security and fills an emotional hole that you need filled.

892
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:59,740
And you don't realize that it's being filled by something as false and nonsensical as a

893
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,820
boogeyman under your bed.

894
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,000
I realize that.

895
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,020
You may, but I don't feel like you're empathizing to that.

896
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,020
I'm not.

897
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,980
I'm thoroughly not because they're not children.

898
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,020
That's okay, and that's your right.

899
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,060
I disagree with you.

900
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,540
I understand that.

901
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:21,620
So if we're pretending that this is Alex's last show, one of the things that he would

902
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:26,180
obviously do in this last show is put off going to calls and not really get around to

903
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,180
them.

904
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,180
Oh yeah, of course.

905
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,520
And so he does successfully do that by screaming about all sorts of stuff.

906
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,020
And then he finally does get to calls, and in normal caller fashion, they're kind of

907
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,840
a bummer.

908
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:45,780
This one guy who calls in has been in the capital, in DC, since the 6th.

909
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,780
Not the building.

910
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,780
Okay.

911
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,780
Excuse me.

912
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,780
All right.

913
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,780
Okay.

914
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:56,700
So he's really struggling to understand why Trump would go away.

915
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:02,020
Why would he get on an airplane and give up on being president if we know the election

916
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,020
was stolen?

917
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,020
Right.

918
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,020
If we know these people are demons.

919
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,020
Right.

920
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,020
Why would he do that?

921
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,020
It's tough.

922
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,020
Yeah.

923
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:13,540
So I got the call from the president to be here on January 6th, and I'm still here.

924
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,500
Well, God bless you, brother.

925
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,500
What do you see there?

926
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,500
What's unfolded?

927
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,900
I see a lot of buses.

928
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,940
A lot of buses with the tinted windows.

929
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:29,100
And I'm hoping that there are troops, real troops, US soldiers.

930
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:34,460
One thing that you're not mentioning at all is where's Trump?

931
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:39,460
If he doesn't say something and start the insurrection act or something to slow this

932
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:44,180
down, this will be worse than the Bay of Pigs.

933
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,180
I hear you.

934
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,500
That's what I'm saying is he's surrounded.

935
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,220
No one is supporting him.

936
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,100
The cube movement was to make people think he was invincible.

937
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,440
They set us up on the 6th to demonize us.

938
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,440
You said he was chosen by God.

939
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,820
So Trump's going to have Trump's going to leave.

940
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,380
I mean, that's what's going down here, brother, those troops.

941
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,660
But here's the weird wrinkle.

942
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,460
They're now saying the troops are terrorists.

943
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,900
Fox News is saying and CNN's reporting they don't trust the troops either.

944
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,420
So who knows what's going on up there?

945
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,420
I mean, this is crazy, brother.

946
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,340
We're about to find out, aren't we?

947
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,060
We the people know what the truth is.

948
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,540
We know there was election fraud.

949
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,560
We know COVID is a hoax.

950
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,980
We know there's a rampant pedophilia going on.

951
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,220
We know Epstein didn't kill himself.

952
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,880
We know we didn't send help for the Benghazi soldiers.

953
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,980
We know that Joe Biden sent a senile.

954
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,980
What in the heck?

955
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:35,240
How can a man get on a plane and fly away from all of this?

956
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,180
He also said he would never surrender.

957
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:42,200
So I'm here in the belly of the beast waiting for the command.

958
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,460
That's so sad.

959
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,020
That just really bums me out.

960
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:51,060
That's a guy who's accepted and internalized all of these, these narratives from right

961
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,060
wing media.

962
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:56,820
And he's really, he has the right thought, but he's not reaching the conclusion.

963
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:02,620
And that is how could Trump, if he is our hero, how could he know all of these things

964
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:06,060
and allow it to continue?

965
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,420
Take the next step, buddy.

966
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:15,540
I would imagine that the next step is making up a reason that makes him still be the hero.

967
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:22,140
Or just turning it into like, uh, Trump was set up himself or yeah, who knows what Alex

968
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,140
is doing?

969
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,140
He's surrounded.

970
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,140
He can't do anything.

971
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,340
No, he was chosen by God.

972
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,340
He was defeated.

973
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,940
So was God, but that's not his fault or God's fault somehow.

974
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,900
Really no one's no, it's no one's probably the devil.

975
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:33,900
It's probably the devil.

976
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:39,500
So another caller calls in and Alex gives him some bad advice that if people are listening

977
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:44,020
to a show and taking him seriously, Alex could like be costing people thousands and thousands

978
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,220
and thousands of dollars.

979
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:51,060
Coming from a blue state, you know, in a populated area, we got a thousand people per square

980
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,060
mile.

981
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,060
Easy.

982
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,100
Here is the time to go here.

983
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:02,620
You know, we, we continue to quest for those who 100% is, is, is, you know, downsize your

984
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,760
life and have, and have cultural goodness with God.

985
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,540
It's worth everything not to be part of the system.

986
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,860
You must flee blue States and blue cities.

987
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:13,340
They're designed to totally collapse and bring down the entire United States.

988
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,340
God bless your brother.

989
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:19,660
So I guess, um, this caller, he does mention that he is like, his family has some land

990
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,660
he can go to.

991
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,660
Sure.

992
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:26,060
But like if you're someone who's listening, uprooting your life, it would be very, very

993
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,060
expensive.

994
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,060
Sure.

995
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,460
Um, and Alex is good thing that his family has land though.

996
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:35,580
Well, that makes it less, this caller does, but not other people who are listening probably

997
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,560
if they believe what Alex is saying, they're like, they're coming to kill you.

998
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,900
They want to chop you up.

999
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:45,140
Uh, you know, America's over, it's time to flee the blue cities cause they're death traps

1000
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,740
and they're meant to collapse.

1001
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:52,740
Like he could fuck around and ruin people's lives in a way that you'd never hear about.

1002
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:57,000
You'd never hear about these people who would listen to Alex, took him seriously and decided

1003
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
to go to Idaho.

1004
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,380
And I'm sorry to the people of Idaho that that's the example I often come up with.

1005
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,380
Sure.

1006
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,380
It could be Montana.

1007
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,380
Idaho is a great state.

1008
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,660
Idaho, could be Oregon, could be any of those.

1009
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:12,020
I mean, but a penny that they're spending on moving to a remote location is a penny

1010
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,580
they're not giving to Alex.

1011
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,580
That's true.

1012
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,980
So except if they need, I think Alex is the one who's the real loser in this scenario.

1013
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,260
Not if they need to stock up with survival food.

1014
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,460
Ooh, that's fair.

1015
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,460
Yeah.

1016
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,460
He's got that one.

1017
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,460
He's got them coming and going.

1018
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,460
He does.

1019
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,460
Literally.

1020
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,460
Literally.

1021
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,220
And he has those water filters that are the size of a school bus and the only, he's the

1022
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,540
new Amazon for people who flee.

1023
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,540
Yeah.

1024
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:38,300
So Alex now has a guest on, it's Jason Jones.

1025
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:44,060
He's a guy who didn't like COVID restrictions and came to Alex's attention through a YouTube

1026
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,900
video, I think.

1027
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:52,700
Anyway, he is there because he was at the Capitol on the 6th and he's complaining about

1028
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:57,100
how the media's gaslighting people about what happened.

1029
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,340
This is so funny.

1030
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,340
Mic down for this.

1031
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,340
Okay.

1032
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,340
Because this made me laugh so hard.

1033
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,520
You know, it's one thing to tell a lie.

1034
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,220
It's another to seem like you believe your own lies.

1035
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:13,260
It was all, it was all quite horrifying, Alex, and it just convinced me that we have to double

1036
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:21,700
down on our commitment to freedom of speech, freedom of religion, free and fair elections.

1037
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,380
And you know, we're not, we're not going anywhere.

1038
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,500
We're going to keep standing up.

1039
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:32,100
Oh, I thought Alex was still here.

1040
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:44,900
I thought, okay, so yeah, I, uh, that, that's what I got.

1041
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,900
Out to break.

1042
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,900
That's, that's good stuff, man.

1043
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,180
I thought eating a sandwich was rude.

1044
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,180
Alex just left.

1045
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,420
I love it.

1046
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,420
That's beautiful.

1047
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,700
That is beautiful.

1048
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:02,060
Ah, I don't understand how Trump could just leave, you know, knowing everything he knows.

1049
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,020
I don't understand how Trump could just leave.

1050
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,500
Alex, I don't know how he could just leave.

1051
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,500
It's remarkable.

1052
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,460
I mean, Jason was saying like Alex, he was addressing Alex and Alex wasn't there.

1053
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,540
That's fantastic.

1054
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:18,360
He later says that he was walking around with a headset mic so he could hear everything

1055
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,860
that Jason Jones was saying.

1056
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,860
Sure.

1057
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,140
Uh, there's man, that is, that is profoundly rude.

1058
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,140
That is fantastic.

1059
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,140
Yeah.

1060
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,140
Yeah.

1061
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,140
Love it.

1062
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,580
Doesn't matter how much of a dick Alex is.

1063
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,580
Doesn't matter.

1064
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,580
He has a platform.

1065
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,580
Just keep on coming.

1066
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:32,580
Okay.

1067
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:38,220
Um, somebody who used Alex's platform, uh, maybe for nefarious purposes, Steve Pachannik

1068
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:42,060
and uh, Steve might have turned evil according to Alex in this.

1069
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,060
Okay.

1070
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:47,060
And he seems to be implying that Steve flipped over and started supporting Q cause he turned

1071
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,060
evil.

1072
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,060
Okay.

1073
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,220
But that introduces a problem and that is that Alex is huge on General Flynn now.

1074
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,220
Right.

1075
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,540
General Flynn pledged allegiance to Q.

1076
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,540
There's that.

1077
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:59,980
So Alex tries to thread this needle here and it does not work.

1078
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:04,120
The movement was exploding, Q came along to take control of it with intelligence ops.

1079
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,340
We now know that well-known intelligence ops that I know personally flipped to Q at the

1080
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,860
end because they were controlled.

1081
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,740
Um, General Flynn's a great guy.

1082
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:14,140
He just wanted to lead an army that was waiting there with Q, but he still didn't control

1083
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,140
it.

1084
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,140
He's a good guy.

1085
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,140
Oh, so he's a good guy.

1086
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,780
He's, he just wanted to control an army.

1087
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,140
I don't know.

1088
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,140
I don't know.

1089
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:28,220
I feel like controlling an army under false pretenses makes you less of a good guy.

1090
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,220
Right?

1091
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,220
Oh, okay.

1092
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,220
Good guy.

1093
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,220
He's a good dude.

1094
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:35,620
He's just, uh, you know, lying to all these evil people in order to turn them into an

1095
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,060
army that he can use to overthrow the government, Dan.

1096
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,060
Yeah.

1097
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,060
That's a patriot.

1098
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,060
Mm-hmm.

1099
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:47,700
And see, the problem with QAnon, according to Jason Jones, is, uh, you know, they use

1100
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,980
vague information from anonymous sources.

1101
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,980
Mm-hmm.

1102
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,860
While you're listening to this, just remember how many times Alex has referenced vague things

1103
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,580
that a Lieutenant Colonel told him.

1104
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,100
People have such faith in Q.

1105
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:06,660
I've been startled at people in my life, people I love and know from, I went to high school

1106
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,220
with, college with, served in the army.

1107
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:12,660
They're just, I'm getting inundated with these texts and forwards that their source, they

1108
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,980
all have these sources and I'll call them and I'll say, listen, you know, put, put that

1109
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,980
aside for now.

1110
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,680
Please stop sharing this information.

1111
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,240
It's from an anonymous source.

1112
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:26,440
It's communicated in a, in a way that's ambiguous and you can't verify what they state.

1113
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:32,140
When you have, uh, um, an ambiguous statement from an anonymous source that cannot be verified,

1114
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,620
you can't support it or refute it.

1115
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:38,700
All that can lead to is infighting and mistrust.

1116
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,900
And then that's the structure, the very structure.

1117
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,860
It doesn't matter even the content of what they say.

1118
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:48,940
It doesn't matter what you say when it's from an anonymous source, said in an ambiguous

1119
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:53,220
way that cannot be verified or refuted.

1120
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,780
The only thing you have that is argument.

1121
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,020
It is a satanic action.

1122
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,020
What?

1123
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,020
What?

1124
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:06,300
I mean, Jason might as well be explaining what Alex does and Alex turns in it's a satanic

1125
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,300
system.

1126
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1127
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,300
It's very dumb.

1128
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:15,440
I do like whenever a self-awareness of one's evil is allowed to sublimate through blaming

1129
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,440
someone else.

1130
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,440
That's good.

1131
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,440
That's good stuff.

1132
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,400
Way to not reflect.

1133
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,740
So earlier on this episode we heard Alex pretty bad, you know, freaking out a little bit.

1134
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,740
They're going to kill you.

1135
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,740
They're going to chop you up.

1136
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:28,740
Sure.

1137
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,740
Shit's going down.

1138
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,740
Naturally.

1139
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,740
Poison in the water.

1140
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:32,740
Uh-huh.

1141
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:33,740
They're going to kill you.

1142
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:34,740
Naturally.

1143
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,260
He was also very viscerally responding to things.

1144
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,260
He seemed pretty mad.

1145
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:41,220
And that's why this is really, really funny.

1146
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:47,460
You have been probably, you should write a book on maintaining inner peace.

1147
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,940
I agree.

1148
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,940
I very much agree.

1149
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,060
Breathe through the nose.

1150
00:53:51,060 --> 00:54:00,820
I very much agree that I have often been lacking a zen and the art of screaming propaganda.

1151
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:04,460
This position's called the sun salutation.

1152
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:05,460
Do it every morning.

1153
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,460
Keeps me centered.

1154
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,460
Keeps me sane.

1155
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,500
And she's going to start some Adderall real quick and then I'm going to yoga.

1156
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:20,180
First Adderall, then incense, we burn incense to keep the vibe real chill in the house.

1157
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:22,980
I always have a glass of tea.

1158
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:28,900
You know what's fun about yoga is whenever your right leg is constantly shaking.

1159
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:29,900
Makes it more difficult.

1160
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,900
Yeah, it does stuff.

1161
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,740
So anyway, their interview's stupid, don't care.

1162
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,660
And that brings us to the 19th.

1163
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:42,500
So now we're on to Tuesday, the day before Communist Joe Biden becomes president.

1164
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:48,040
And since we're recording this on the 21st, we know that it went off without a hitch.

1165
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,700
No real trouble at the inauguration.

1166
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:57,740
I'd say 25,000 uniformed troops probably is a pretty good deterrent.

1167
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,060
Probably.

1168
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:05,260
He gave his speech and it sort of flew in the face of he's senile, he can't talk for

1169
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,900
even a minute kind of stuff.

1170
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,560
There was an issue.

1171
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,660
So Alex is still living in the before times though.

1172
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:18,460
But he does know that that is what's going to happen, that Biden is going to get in.

1173
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,460
Sure.

1174
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:23,900
Unfortunately, almost half of his audience believes Steve.

1175
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:28,540
And I have a lot of people mad at me, but you won't be mad tomorrow when you see that

1176
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,540
I told you the truth.

1177
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,540
You'll be very, very sad.

1178
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:35,860
We had a poll on infowars.com over the weekend with tens of thousands of people that clicked

1179
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:36,860
on it.

1180
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,100
I don't know if we ever had a chance to pull that up, show an article about it where we

1181
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,360
can repost it and have people vote again.

1182
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:49,180
And over 45% thought that everyone's being mass arrested and Trump's gonna stay in office.

1183
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,180
Absolutely incredible.

1184
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,540
Well, maybe part of that is because of the people you talk to.

1185
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:53,540
I don't understand.

1186
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,540
Maybe it's because of-

1187
00:55:54,540 --> 00:56:00,460
It is absolutely incredible that my audience, after me telling them this, would believe

1188
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,460
it.

1189
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,860
And me having guests on who I've overinflated their credibility.

1190
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:04,860
Totally.

1191
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,540
Saying that they know everything, they overthrow countries.

1192
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:11,180
I mean, you've had somebody who's literally toppled governments before.

1193
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:15,220
I don't understand why we would believe he couldn't once more.

1194
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,220
Exactly.

1195
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,220
Yeah.

1196
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:21,860
I think that that's indicative of... I mean, I don't know how scientific these polls are

1197
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:28,300
on Infowars, but assuming that a third of his audience even, let's say, believes that

1198
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:34,360
Steve is right and that Trump is gonna somehow magically remain president, if I saw that

1199
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,140
number for our audience, I would think I'd failed.

1200
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,140
Yeah, I would strongly believe that.

1201
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,860
I think that's a big problem with my audience.

1202
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,860
Yeah.

1203
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:46,340
I would almost say that would be a reason for us to quit doing the show.

1204
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,340
Yeah.

1205
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,340
Yeah.

1206
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,340
We're bad for people.

1207
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,340
Alex doesn't look at it that way.

1208
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:55,740
He's kind of excited for them to be proven wrong and to be proven right.

1209
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:56,740
Just a little shitty.

1210
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,900
That'll show the people who give me money.

1211
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,900
Yeah.

1212
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:07,540
So there's a loose thread dangling from the sixth, and that is that Alex has said repeatedly,

1213
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:13,600
and on microphones, that Trump personally asked him to lead the march from the speech

1214
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,240
to the Capitol building.

1215
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,300
Doesn't look good in hindsight.

1216
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,620
Does not.

1217
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:20,380
Turns out Alex was set up from the inside.

1218
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,380
Okay.

1219
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:22,380
Okay.

1220
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:26,300
He wanted a million people in DC to peacefully demonstrate so that we would show we had more

1221
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,900
numbers than they did and to show that Biden couldn't fill a parking lot and Trump could

1222
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:34,020
get a million people there, that Trump was coming to speak at a stage that was set up

1223
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,020
on the other side.

1224
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:39,340
But it was all a setup.

1225
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,700
That stage was there the night before.

1226
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,540
It was broken down by the time we got there.

1227
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,540
Oh, we were totally set up.

1228
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:48,220
We walked completely into a trap with people inside his administration we know now that

1229
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:55,020
set Trump up and told him, uh, that, uh, you know, it's Jones's idea to march the Capitol

1230
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,020
and all this stuff.

1231
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,020
And it's a great idea.

1232
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:00,060
You should tell him to lead it because they intended for me to go in there and lead that

1233
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,420
thing so they could throw my ass in prison.

1234
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:05,520
But of course, by the time I got there, I saw what was happening and tried to stop it.

1235
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:13,460
This is the real world, people who inside the Trump administration was trying to set

1236
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,460
you up.

1237
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,460
Name names.

1238
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:18,340
If somebody was trying to set you up, I would imagine you would really want to name names.

1239
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,660
That'd be big news.

1240
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,660
Yeah.

1241
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,420
I think everybody would give you a lot of attention if you could name names.

1242
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,420
Yeah.

1243
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,420
Come on, Alex.

1244
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,440
Jesus does not doesn't.

1245
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:33,500
So the globalist plan, um, Oh, also, by the way, I realize now that we've moved on to

1246
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,500
the 19th.

1247
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:39,180
He didn't really do a last episode on the 18th, but he also didn't say I'm doing it

1248
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:40,180
tomorrow.

1249
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,380
So I assume that was meant to be it.

1250
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,740
And it was just that outburst and he just got distracted.

1251
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:49,180
I think he just did an outburst and started yelling and hoped it would be kind of look

1252
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,180
like network.

1253
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,180
Sure.

1254
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,660
That's kind of the feeling that I get.

1255
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:57,540
I think, I think his last broadcast being like 15 minutes long would really be great

1256
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,540
for me.

1257
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:06,500
His last broadcast being talking about migrant caravans over, over exaggerating their fear

1258
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,180
that you should have for them.

1259
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:12,660
And then that putting him into a mood where he screams about shit and how you're all going

1260
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,660
to die.

1261
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,660
Right.

1262
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,980
And this is over man.

1263
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,520
And then puts off going to calls.

1264
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,520
I think that's fitting.

1265
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,520
I think that's pretty good.

1266
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,820
I mean, that's about right.

1267
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:24,820
It's either that or him just being like, and now I'm going to say all the slurs that I've

1268
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:28,620
wanted to since the beginning in alphabetical order.

1269
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:29,620
Hey.

1270
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:30,620
Yeah.

1271
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,780
Also, here's what I think about Willy Wonka.

1272
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:33,780
Yes.

1273
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:34,780
Yeah.

1274
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:35,780
Yeah.

1275
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,220
I watched it last night and I've got a 20 minute review.

1276
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:41,260
Horrific, horrific racism plus sci-fi reviews.

1277
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:42,260
Yeah.

1278
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:50,020
Um, speaking of sci-fi, did you know that, um, H.G. Wells, formerly was the head of the

1279
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,020
bad guys?

1280
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,300
I did not know that.

1281
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:53,300
I learned that.

1282
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,300
Okay.

1283
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:58,580
And they were planning this takeover for a hundred years, really longer.

1284
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,580
You can debate.

1285
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:05,540
I mean, 1850s, they had the basic plan under Galton Wedgwood and Huxley.

1286
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:06,540
Sure.

1287
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:10,940
Those are the grandparents of like Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley.

1288
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:18,260
And then by 1900, H.G. Wells was the leader of the Illuminati and they had more of the

1289
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:22,740
modern plan all dialed up and ready, but it was all extremely visionary.

1290
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:23,740
Just ultra visionary.

1291
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:27,300
They're always 30, 40 years ahead of everybody, which is why they say they have the right

1292
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,300
to do this.

1293
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,300
And I understand their perspective.

1294
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:33,060
I mean, I'm not going to join them because I can feel my immortal soul is in danger.

1295
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:34,060
I can feel it.

1296
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,700
Uh, but I understand why they're doing it.

1297
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:36,700
It makes a lot of sense.

1298
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:37,700
I mean, the public's so dumb.

1299
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,860
They can openly take everything away from you and kill you.

1300
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:40,860
You put up with it.

1301
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:41,860
You deserve to die.

1302
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:42,860
Wow.

1303
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:43,860
Alex.

1304
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:44,860
Strong words.

1305
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:45,860
Yeah.

1306
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:46,860
Strong words immediately following.

1307
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:50,100
I think that the Dead Authors podcast by Paul F. Tompkins is real.

1308
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:53,140
You shouldn't, uh, probably have that position.

1309
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:56,700
It seems, it seems, uh, bad.

1310
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:01,120
I think it goes against everything that he said he wanted in the past for saving people

1311
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,120
in the light.

1312
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,120
It does feel that way.

1313
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,120
Yeah.

1314
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:08,300
Also, if like, uh, the H.G. Wells was the leader of the Illuminati, but this plan only

1315
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:13,060
goes back to the Wedgewoods in 1850, the Illuminati started in 1776.

1316
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,060
Sure.

1317
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:15,060
Right?

1318
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:16,060
I mean.

1319
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,060
Something along those lines.

1320
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,940
Doesn't that go back before 1850?

1321
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:19,940
Who knows?

1322
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,940
This is stupid.

1323
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:21,940
They were the new Illuminati.

1324
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:27,420
Like the old Illuminati died, Coke brought it back in new Illuminati, I believe.

1325
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,420
That sounds right.

1326
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,380
Anyway, H.G. Wells, not just an author.

1327
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,380
No.

1328
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:34,380
Head of the Illuminati.

1329
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:35,380
Not just a...

1330
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,380
Cool.

1331
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:37,380
Yeah.

1332
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:38,380
Cool.

1333
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:42,020
Um, Alex doesn't have a meeting with him, but he might have a meeting with another top

1334
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,020
Illuminati figure.

1335
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,020
Okay.

1336
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:47,220
The difference is I'm not going to join him, though I am going to be meeting with a top

1337
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:48,740
globalist the next month.

1338
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:49,740
Top globalist.

1339
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:53,660
So I will be entertaining, at least what they have to say, because it's important to keep

1340
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,660
those dialogues going.

1341
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,240
What?

1342
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,240
What did you just say?

1343
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,240
This is very serious, ladies and gentlemen.

1344
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:03,300
This is your life, your soul, your children's future, and you just have to understand that

1345
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,380
I'm not going to sit here and debate and argue with people about this stuff.

1346
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,700
It's all out in the open.

1347
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,940
So yeah, Alex is going to have a meeting with the top globalists.

1348
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,340
So it's got to be what?

1349
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:13,340
Bill Gates?

1350
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:14,340
It has to be something like that.

1351
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:16,340
Although he's a middle man now.

1352
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,340
Maybe.

1353
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,340
Maybe.

1354
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:19,340
It's possible.

1355
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,340
It's possible.

1356
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,340
That's Alex's guess to ask.

1357
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,340
Yeah.

1358
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:23,340
Could be Klaus Schwab?

1359
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,340
It could be.

1360
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,340
Could be.

1361
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:26,340
Could be.

1362
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,820
I want to say it's a secret Rothschild.

1363
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,940
I think it's one of the ones that we've never heard of.

1364
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,220
A mystery Rothschild?

1365
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:32,420
Yeah, that's why they get away with it.

1366
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:34,460
Like that one Jonas brother who's not in the group?

1367
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,460
There's another Jonas brother?

1368
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,460
There's a bonus Jonas.

1369
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,460
There's a secret Jonas?

1370
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:38,460
Yeah.

1371
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,460
Who was it?

1372
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:46,220
Was it the Kennedys who supposedly had a relative that they kept in the attic or something like

1373
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,220
that?

1374
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,220
I think they did.

1375
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:49,220
Oh, that's right.

1376
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,220
Yeah.

1377
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:51,220
Holy shit.

1378
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,220
That's real weird that we're just...

1379
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:53,220
Oh, that's crazy.

1380
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,220
Yeah.

1381
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,620
I was just talking about a Jonas brother who didn't get to be in the fucking group.

1382
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,620
You're talking about something really sad.

1383
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,260
I thought it was a myth at first.

1384
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,260
No.

1385
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,500
I don't know who Alex is talking about.

1386
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,900
I also don't believe this is true.

1387
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:11,680
But the globalists, they need you to accept their plan in order for them to get away with

1388
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,680
what they're doing.

1389
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,680
Sure.

1390
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,680
Alex expresses this a little bit.

1391
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,420
And then I wanted to talk a tiny bit about where this idea comes from.

1392
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:21,900
Humanity is starting to wake up and actually be who they should be and say no to it.

1393
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:26,460
And then the globalists don't get to play the social Darwin game.

1394
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:30,380
But if you don't recognize what they're doing, if you don't have an open dialogue with the

1395
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:34,100
globalist and talk to them person to person and say, I know what you're doing.

1396
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,100
You don't have a right.

1397
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,380
I'm going to resist you.

1398
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:39,740
Then they have no respect for you and will run over you.

1399
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:44,180
They metaphysically need you to acquiesce and submit.

1400
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:46,380
They always have to leave you an escape valve.

1401
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:50,540
That is a rule of the universe that God has put down and they follow these rules.

1402
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:51,540
He got his ass kicked by Satan.

1403
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:55,260
And if you won't study what they're up to and if you won't study their plan versus God's

1404
01:03:55,260 --> 01:04:03,060
plan, and if you won't make a spiritual, cultural, economic and physical decision who you're

1405
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:06,780
with, then you are fair game to them.

1406
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:12,880
So the religious stuff that he adds on to this is whatever, but like the idea that if

1407
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:18,580
you don't know their plan and specifically fight back, like he's just taking that from

1408
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:24,260
that fake document, Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars, which was chapter one of Bill Cooper's

1409
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,740
book Behold the Pale Horse.

1410
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:32,220
We covered this in depth in our episode number 381 on this podcast, so I don't want to rehash

1411
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,580
all the history of that again.

1412
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:37,100
But if you're interested in how fake that document is, go and listen to that.

1413
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:41,040
On page six of that fake document, there's a particular quote that Bill Cooper would

1414
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,100
repeat over and over and over again on his show.

1415
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,820
So to the point where like if you were a listener, you would definitely have that implanted in

1416
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:50,460
your mind as a really important point.

1417
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:53,420
Quote, all science is merely a means to an end.

1418
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:54,620
The means is knowledge.

1419
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:55,980
The end is control.

1420
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,000
Beyond this remains only one issue.

1421
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,900
Who will be the beneficiary?

1422
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:03,280
In 1954, this was the issue of primary concern.

1423
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:07,700
Although the so-called moral issues were raised, in view of the law of natural selection, it

1424
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:12,100
was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence are no

1425
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:15,060
better than animals who do not have intelligence.

1426
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:20,140
Such people are beasts of burden and stakes on the table by choice and consent.

1427
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:23,860
This is where Alex's idea that if you don't directly fight the globalists, that's the

1428
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:28,980
equivalent of you consenting for them to do whatever you want, they want to do to you.

1429
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:33,860
That if you're, if they can get away with taking all your stuff, you know, that's, this

1430
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,780
is all just silent weapons for quiet wars.

1431
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:40,620
I've heard Alex reference the document before, I know he was a huge Bill Cooper listener,

1432
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:45,580
like that's all, that's all this like mythology about the globalists needing you to consent

1433
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:48,180
by not fighting them stuff comes from.

1434
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:49,820
It's all just a fake document.

1435
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:55,940
I assume he's apologized for saying that he knows God's plan and he can see it and he's

1436
01:05:55,940 --> 01:06:01,260
part of God's plan and that he's, and he's apologized for being wrong and he said that

1437
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:07,260
he can't see God's plan and maybe, you know, all of his ideas of what God can control are

1438
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:08,260
off.

1439
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,260
No, not once.

1440
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:10,260
Not once?

1441
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:11,260
This is all still part of God's plan.

1442
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:16,620
God's plan is now for him to fight Joe Biden politically and make a bunch of money telling

1443
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:17,660
people to head to the woods.

1444
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:22,300
See now, I thought he had already told me that God's plan was for him to defeat Joe

1445
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:27,620
Biden and the devil and Trump to take over and create a lasting 1,000 year long reign.

1446
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:31,260
I don't know if he was ever specific about the 1,000 year reign, but it did certainly

1447
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:33,060
have overtones of that.

1448
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,300
Yeah, I don't know.

1449
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,300
I don't know.

1450
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:41,380
One of the things about prophets is when they're alive, they're really slippery.

1451
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:45,980
They change their prophecies quite a bit.

1452
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:48,100
Joseph Smith was real good at that.

1453
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,380
He had a real talent for that.

1454
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:53,180
Kind of, it's where long form improv comes from.

1455
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,500
It might be.

1456
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:59,220
Super long form improv is rearranging prophecies.

1457
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:01,300
Decades long form improv.

1458
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:06,220
So these games that Alex is playing with his predictions and stuff, maybe decades long,

1459
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:10,220
but the globalists, their plan is hundreds of years old.

1460
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:12,460
You can debate it.

1461
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,420
Maybe it's 1850.

1462
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:16,500
Maybe it's H.G. Wells.

1463
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,580
Maybe it's Mesopotamia.

1464
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:20,580
Maybe it's the pyramids.

1465
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:21,580
That doesn't sound right.

1466
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:22,580
Okay, well that sounds closer.

1467
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:26,820
But anyway, Alex is going to take a meeting with them because he thinks, in his hubris

1468
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:32,220
filled mind, somehow he thinks he's going to talk the globalists out of their plans.

1469
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:36,620
I don't take enjoyment seeing how screwed up and falling apart humanity is.

1470
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:42,180
But the plan is to make humanity so dysfunctional that those of us that aren't part of it are

1471
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:46,920
going to basically have to either commit suicide or join with the globalists and wipe your

1472
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,500
asses out.

1473
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:53,380
Because if you won't stand up for yourself, then I can't help you.

1474
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:58,660
And I'm not going to join the globalists, and I've openly had dialogues with some of

1475
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:03,140
their next to top level people, and I've had some dialogue with their top people, and they

1476
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:04,980
want me to stop.

1477
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:07,700
And they are not going to be able to convince me, I'm going to try to convince them.

1478
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,140
Yeah, that's going to work.

1479
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:13,480
I don't believe any of this stuff, but let's humor him for a second and imagine that he's

1480
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:18,320
going to go into, I don't know, a meeting with Klaus Schwab and be like, you gotta cut

1481
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,320
it out, man.

1482
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:22,400
And they're going to be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I have not heard this information

1483
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,400
before.

1484
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,540
Are you serious?

1485
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:25,700
This is bad for humanity?

1486
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,100
Oh no, I'm talking to the devil?

1487
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,100
Fuck!

1488
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:35,620
You know, his horns and the fact that I could never see him through the shadowy fire, that

1489
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:37,300
I agree might have been a sign.

1490
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:39,420
Fuck, I should have figured this out.

1491
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:43,780
Can't believe it took a weird Texan guy yelling at me to help me see the light.

1492
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:44,860
Hold on one second.

1493
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:47,060
Hold on, Alex, just real quick.

1494
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:53,540
Are you telling me that when I sold my soul to the literal devil, he was lying to me?

1495
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:56,580
Alex has also said that these people act compulsively and they can't help themselves.

1496
01:08:56,580 --> 01:09:00,980
So I don't know how he's going to talk anybody out of anything.

1497
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:03,580
They're also not human anymore, according to Alex.

1498
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:05,540
I don't know what having a parlay is going to do.

1499
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:07,180
It's all such stupid shit.

1500
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:15,020
Well, I guess in order for him to enact his plans, he also has to get their tacit consent.

1501
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,660
Because it's a rule of the universe.

1502
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:17,820
It's God's plan.

1503
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:21,220
No, because he's not doing anything to them.

1504
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:24,420
They only play it's to.

1505
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:28,540
The globalists only need your consent because the things that they're doing affect you,

1506
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,860
like chemtrails over the country club.

1507
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:31,860
Sure.

1508
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:32,860
Sure.

1509
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:36,100
That affects all of us because of our passivity and not fighting them on it.

1510
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,740
That's consent to have chemtrails dropped on us.

1511
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:41,940
Well, I mean, if you're going to defeat the globalists, I assume they're going to lose

1512
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:43,540
all of their money and power.

1513
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:45,580
So that's doing something to them.

1514
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:48,940
Yeah, but.

1515
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:53,540
I'm just saying, if it's a universal law, he actually has to get the consent of the

1516
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:55,740
globalists before he can defeat them.

1517
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:56,740
Fine.

1518
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:59,220
Then I guess sports can't exist.

1519
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,220
Not in God's plan.

1520
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:04,320
Because then every team has to consent to be beaten.

1521
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,620
You have to sign a waiver before you play the game.

1522
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:07,620
Oh, God.

1523
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,400
You both consent to.

1524
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:15,460
So Alex has a guest on this episode here on the 19th, and it's not an interview I'm

1525
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,340
really interested in all that much.

1526
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:24,100
It is the brother of John Sullivan, the guy who got arrested for videotaping inside the

1527
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,460
Capitol building.

1528
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:30,820
And Alex has decided he's the big Antifa leader who caused all the trouble.

1529
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:35,460
We've got Mike Flynn the third, because Mike Flynn and Mike Jr. are not answering my calls

1530
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:36,460
anymore.

1531
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:42,980
So James Sullivan is a guy who has some right wing tendencies and is the brother of John.

1532
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,100
I just, I heard this, I was just like, ah.

1533
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,100
So James, wow.

1534
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,100
Incredible.

1535
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:50,540
Tell us about yourself, about your brother and why you're on air with us and what you've

1536
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:51,540
witnessed.

1537
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:53,220
Because you're very well known in Utah.

1538
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:55,340
You've been in news for a while countering your brother.

1539
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:57,620
I mean, you're not just popping up now after this.

1540
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:58,820
You've been warning folks for a while.

1541
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:02,420
This must be really hard for you to do.

1542
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:04,620
Yeah, yeah, it was.

1543
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:07,300
This interview is deeply irresponsible.

1544
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:11,140
A lot of it ends up just being James talking about John's personal life in ways that I

1545
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:13,620
don't feel like they belong on Info Wars.

1546
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:16,700
And a lot of it kind of left me feeling gross and uncomfortable.

1547
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:20,760
I know that Alex really needs to build up John Sullivan as the big Antifa boogeyman

1548
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,900
in order to carry his conspiracy theories about the storming of the Capitol being a

1549
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:27,700
false flag, but this feels super inappropriate.

1550
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:31,460
The whole thing is Alex trying to get James to give some details that Alex can use to

1551
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,060
build a deeper narrative.

1552
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:37,580
He's asking these probing questions about like, did someone put him on drugs or do you

1553
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:40,300
know who his handler might be?

1554
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,900
It's really gross.

1555
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:48,940
And also, I don't know if James, however much he might disagree with his brother, I don't

1556
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:54,500
know what kind of potential damage he realizes could come to him by virtue of the way this

1557
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,200
conversation goes.

1558
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:01,380
If I fumbled in the Super Super Bowl in the one yard line, not understanding I was being

1559
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:05,300
set up in all this, and I did, I don't take blame for it because I'm in the arena and

1560
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:09,140
we were fighting for election integrity and calling for legal and lawful things to happen.

1561
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:13,320
I'm now being accused of trying to foment things, but he didn't fumble at the one yard

1562
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,320
line.

1563
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:18,620
He scored and won the game against America in the Super Super Bowl of our Republic.

1564
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:23,380
I mean, if they put a tombstone saying our Republic died in the future, if we don't come

1565
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:27,340
back from this, it will be your brother and people like him that day that helped kill

1566
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:28,340
the country.

1567
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:29,340
Yeah.

1568
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:32,540
Oh, that's not good.

1569
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:37,780
I don't know if he realizes like the kind of conversation that they're having here is

1570
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:43,540
like, it's really the kind of thing that could potentially put a target on.

1571
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:47,220
Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Sullivan, real quick, do you want our listeners to kill your brother?

1572
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:51,580
I just want you to, I just want you to agree with me that all of this is your brother's

1573
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:52,580
fault.

1574
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:59,900
He has killed the country and he of course deserves, I'm not going to, politically.

1575
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:00,900
Right.

1576
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:01,900
Yeah.

1577
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:05,840
And at the same time too, this dude is saying that there was somebody who was along filming

1578
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:11,120
John because they're making a documentary about him and his brother.

1579
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,700
Like the two of them are both like on opposite sides of the political aisle.

1580
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:15,700
Sure.

1581
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:16,700
And so I'm like, I don't know what's going on here.

1582
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:17,700
I don't trust any of this.

1583
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:19,460
I don't care about any of this.

1584
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:20,460
Yeah.

1585
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:21,460
I, yeah, I really don't care.

1586
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:29,620
It's just really, really, really uncomfortable, but I will say that James doesn't realize

1587
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:34,420
what Alex's narrative is clearly because he counters it.

1588
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:37,020
Seeing him wasn't really that much of a surprise.

1589
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:43,540
After he was removed from Utah, he traveled to Kenosha, to California, to Portland, trying

1590
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:46,140
to get into these Antifa communities and they would kick him out.

1591
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:49,500
So seeing him here wasn't really that big of a surprise.

1592
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,500
Huh.

1593
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:55,220
Well, his brother's saying that he keeps getting kicked out of Antifa groups, anti-fascist

1594
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:56,220
groups.

1595
01:13:56,220 --> 01:14:00,540
So it's kind of tough for Alex to then argue that he is an Antifa leader.

1596
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:01,540
Yeah.

1597
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:03,040
I don't know.

1598
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,420
Seems like they're both running a game.

1599
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:11,000
That's what I, I'm not saying that they're running a game, but it does seem like they're

1600
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,040
running a game.

1601
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:16,980
I think that a lot of, there have been some people who have reached out with like their

1602
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:23,360
comments about Jon and from the sense that I get, there is sort of an attention seeking

1603
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:32,120
behavior pattern and kind of disregard for what other people are doing that are productive

1604
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,120
things.

1605
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:40,060
Maybe, maybe I'm just so conditioned to believe anybody in that sphere is running a game of

1606
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:41,060
some kind.

1607
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:46,100
Well, the thing that I think is the most worrying is the idea that someone was making a documentary

1608
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:47,780
about the two of them.

1609
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:53,660
Like that to me is like, okay, if one of you, one of these brothers is someone who seems

1610
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:57,980
to have a clear pattern of attention seeking behavior and the other brothers happens to

1611
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:03,580
be directly on the other side of the political aisle and is doing a documentary with, it

1612
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:05,540
seems like this is all attention seeking behavior.

1613
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:06,540
It really does.

1614
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:10,440
And the fact that you would go and talk about your brother in such a weird way on Infowars

1615
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:11,440
of all places.

1616
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,440
Yeah.

1617
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,660
It just, it grosses me out.

1618
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:20,220
There's too many human elements to it that just like, I wouldn't, I wouldn't like this,

1619
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,980
this kind of conversation to be had about anybody really.

1620
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:29,580
I don't see, I don't see any like either they're like the, okay, so they could be running a

1621
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:34,860
game and this is fucked up or they're not running a game and this is fucked up.

1622
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:35,860
Yeah.

1623
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:36,860
You know, like this is fucked up.

1624
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:37,860
Yeah.

1625
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:38,860
Yeah.

1626
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:42,300
We have not interviewed people who know Alex for a reason because it's uncomfortable and

1627
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,300
fucking weird.

1628
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:44,300
Totally.

1629
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,100
I wish Alex would do the same because this is weird.

1630
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:47,100
This is weird.

1631
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:51,060
It's very, very unpleasant to listen to it and so we won't listen to any more of it.

1632
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:55,480
Alex does though on this episode, get to sit talking about how he doesn't want Biden dead,

1633
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,860
but he is going to put them in his death pool.

1634
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:57,860
Okay.

1635
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:58,860
That's not great.

1636
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:00,500
So I don't want anything bad to happen by they'll turn them into a martyr, but I do

1637
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:05,300
put a death pool on him, a dead pool.

1638
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:17,500
I don't think he's going to be dead in the next year, but I, I bet Biden, he likes power

1639
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:21,340
though, but they put him in there cause he's so weak and so addled.

1640
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,820
He's talked about stepping down, fainting an illness as a reason to go.

1641
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:24,820
When?

1642
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:25,820
I don't know.

1643
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:28,300
We should have a whole show in debate once we have our installed president, our first

1644
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:29,300
dictator.

1645
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:30,300
So first dictator again.

1646
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:31,300
Yeah.

1647
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:34,100
He was talking about stepping down and faking an illness when he was vice president.

1648
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,100
Yeah.

1649
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,060
If he had a fundamental difference with Obama.

1650
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:38,060
Yeah.

1651
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:41,540
Um, there's a very different situation than, uh, than the current, but whatever.

1652
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:42,540
I don't know.

1653
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:47,060
I know that, you know, he's trying to say he's putting him in the death pool, but I

1654
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:48,060
don't know what it'd be.

1655
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,660
He's saying I put a death pool on him.

1656
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:50,660
Like it's a hex.

1657
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:51,660
Yeah.

1658
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:52,660
He did say that.

1659
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:53,660
It's very weird.

1660
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:54,660
I put a death pool on you.

1661
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:55,660
Yeah.

1662
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:58,820
So we have another guest here before we wrap up the 19th.

1663
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:00,140
This episode was not good.

1664
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:01,940
This was a slog to get through.

1665
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:08,340
Um, Alex has Nick Fuentes on and uh, it's interesting because they have slightly different

1666
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:10,660
viewpoints about the storming of the Capitol.

1667
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:11,660
Unsurprising.

1668
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:13,080
Alex is all false flag.

1669
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,080
This was bad.

1670
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,080
Totally.

1671
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,740
Nick has been pretty in favor.

1672
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:19,620
But they're calling it the great insurrection.

1673
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:21,180
They're calling it into the world.

1674
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:23,620
They're calling for Nick Fuentes to be arrested because he was seen outside.

1675
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,480
They're calling for me to be arrested.

1676
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:29,700
I think it was great to see people say, we know this was a fraudulent election, but I

1677
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:33,980
think it was terrible that some people gave the system what they wanted when they broke

1678
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:34,980
in.

1679
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:37,500
So Nick Fuentes has been quoted in the media as liking what happened.

1680
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,620
I imagine that's probably out of context.

1681
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:42,220
We appreciate him coming on to tell us what he really thinks.

1682
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:46,580
So the founder of the groipers, a former Trump volunteer and popular talk show host, Nick

1683
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,580
Fuentes.

1684
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:48,580
Nick.

1685
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:49,580
Thanks for coming on.

1686
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:50,580
Thanks for having me.

1687
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:55,540
I want to play one thing here that's sort of out of order because I think it, uh, it

1688
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:58,020
uh, is our rights context.

1689
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:59,020
It's our responsibility.

1690
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,020
Okay.

1691
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:03,540
Later people falsely claimed that I breached the Capitol, which wasn't true.

1692
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,780
Uh, but I stood outside the Capitol.

1693
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:09,160
I watched, I gave a little speech and then we packed up and left.

1694
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:13,900
There were people who were claiming that Nick Fuentes was, uh, along with like baked Alaska

1695
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:14,900
in the Capitol.

1696
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:18,980
And there was a picture that definitely looked a ton like Nick Fuentes.

1697
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:19,980
Yeah.

1698
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:22,540
It was quite believable.

1699
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:28,980
And I, uh, took that as proof that he was there cause I looked a lot like him and uh,

1700
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,300
it appears that that's not accurate.

1701
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:31,300
Okay.

1702
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,640
It appears that he was outside.

1703
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,940
He did not go inside.

1704
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:39,060
He claims that is the case and I can't find solid evidence outside of that picture.

1705
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:40,060
Yeah.

1706
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:41,060
Yeah.

1707
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:47,220
And I'm willing to believe, uh, his, uh, his statement that I was wrong when I repeated

1708
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:49,060
that he was in, uh, in the Capitol.

1709
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:50,060
So yeah, totally.

1710
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:54,020
Um, anyway, he still thinks it was great though.

1711
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:55,220
Yeah, of course.

1712
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:58,380
Which almost is more evidence I think that he didn't go inside.

1713
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,380
Yeah.

1714
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:04,260
I, I imagine if he were under arrest right now, he would think less of how great it was.

1715
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:09,140
A lot of people who are getting arrested probably are not like, that was awesome.

1716
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:12,700
I'm a, I'm a big fan of the, Joe Biggs is not, uh, pumped right now.

1717
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:13,700
I'm a big fan.

1718
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,740
I'm a big fan of the, uh, we got carried up in the moment argument.

1719
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:19,500
Hey man, it's a crime of passion, Dan.

1720
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,020
Those don't count.

1721
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:24,860
Well, some people would look at it as a crime of passion and some people would think of

1722
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:32,020
what happened that day, the entirety of it as the culmination of the stop the steal thing

1723
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:33,300
that Alex was a big part of.

1724
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,300
You could say that.

1725
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:38,260
And when we got there, the entire Capitol building was surrounded.

1726
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:44,340
You know, I have to say it was a pretty awesome site because I had been, and I know that you

1727
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:45,620
were there as well.

1728
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:49,940
We were traveling the country in Phoenix, Atlanta, all over the place doing stop the

1729
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:53,700
steal protest, raising awareness about the voter fraud and everything.

1730
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:58,700
And so to finally see hundreds of thousands of Trump supporters surrounding the U S Capitol

1731
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:03,860
building demanding that Mike Pence or the Republican senators take action on the voter

1732
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:04,860
fraud.

1733
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:08,620
And to me, that was kind of like the fulfillment of the past two or three months of stop the

1734
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:10,260
steal protest.

1735
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:15,140
And to me, it looked like the American people were waking up, rising up and all of that.

1736
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:16,980
Everything else was a fulfillment of it too.

1737
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:17,980
Yeah.

1738
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:21,360
Everything else was the logical extension of the movement that you all have been pushing

1739
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,360
down the road.

1740
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,360
Yep.

1741
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:29,540
Anyway, Nick has a little bit of a softer view on QAnon than Alex.

1742
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:30,540
Alex is pretty mad.

1743
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:34,380
And of course a large portion of it always comes down to he wants credit.

1744
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:35,380
Right.

1745
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:37,820
And that is also where this clip is going to go.

1746
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:41,820
But Nick kind of has a position more like, eh, it woke people up.

1747
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:50,020
The normie types, the suburban moms, you know, they, they now know about how all of the people

1748
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:51,620
I don't like are Dracula's.

1749
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:52,620
Yeah.

1750
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,620
Yeah.

1751
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:57,060
Now that we've got the suburban moms terrified, we're on our way to victory.

1752
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:01,220
He sees the utility in that and thinks that there's probably still some ability to get

1753
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:05,420
those people back into a profitable revenue stream.

1754
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:10,540
The good thing about QAnon, I always thought was that it got a lot of regular people to

1755
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:13,700
believe the right things, even if they were believing them for the wrong reasons.

1756
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:19,140
You know, it took a lot of maybe mainstream conservative Republican types who believe

1757
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:24,500
this usual stuff about small government and free trade and mass immigration and low taxes.

1758
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:28,360
And I think it woke them up about the power of the elites and the evil and the corruption

1759
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:33,540
of the elites and kind of this international thing that's going on with all the work that

1760
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:37,780
I did and countless others did and you've been around a while, did, and it became Q

1761
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:41,340
like, Oh, Q knows about this and then it, but don't worry, everything's fine.

1762
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:42,340
But, but, but I mean, I agree.

1763
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:44,420
It was kind of a pop way for the general public.

1764
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:46,420
It was just now waking up to get into it.

1765
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:50,100
See, the thing that I liked about that is that Alex is, is pissed off that he's not

1766
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:51,100
getting credit.

1767
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:55,620
Once again, I want credit for, and in order to not sound like a super petty asshole, he's

1768
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:59,940
like, you've been around a while and it's like 22 years old.

1769
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:00,940
He's a vet now.

1770
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:01,940
He's a veteran.

1771
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:03,380
He was there at the storm in the Capitol.

1772
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:05,220
There's no rookies anymore, Dan.

1773
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:09,620
He was in high school at the 2016 election.

1774
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:10,940
I know I heard him debate.

1775
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:11,940
It was garbage.

1776
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:12,940
Yeah.

1777
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:13,940
Yeah.

1778
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:14,940
Granted.

1779
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:16,740
He was at the unite the right rally and the storming of the Capitol.

1780
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:23,460
He's seen some shit, but he's not been around a while in the way that Alex is pretending.

1781
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,500
You were a big fan of bill Cooper back in the day.

1782
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,500
You're nine.

1783
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,500
Oh, I'm in trouble.

1784
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,940
Let me tell you about scousing.

1785
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:32,500
So it's our last clip here.

1786
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:38,980
Nick is just talking about how the globalists fear Alex because he has an audience.

1787
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:43,660
He can reach people, but what they feared about you and what they feared about Joe Rogan

1788
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:48,860
and a lot of these people is that you have your own totally independent infrastructure

1789
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:53,940
broadcasting to millions and millions of people you still do, and they don't control you and

1790
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:55,780
they don't control what you say.

1791
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:58,180
They want to control everything that people hear.

1792
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:02,020
They want to control what's on their phones, want to control what's on their TV, on their

1793
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:03,020
radio.

1794
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:05,840
They're freaking out that I'm pointing out that the boogaloo's are still on Twitter and

1795
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:06,840
you and I aren't.

1796
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,500
Nick is still verified on Twitter.

1797
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,500
Oh yeah.

1798
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:10,500
It's still there.

1799
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,500
Yeah.

1800
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,500
Yeah.

1801
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,500
So that kind of punctures that.

1802
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,500
I don't know.

1803
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:21,100
I think it's less that everybody wants to control how everybody speaks and all that

1804
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:25,100
and more, you know, there's certain platforms that just don't put up with certain behaviors

1805
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:31,460
and you guys have crossed those lines to the point where people are going to take it seriously.

1806
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:35,180
And I would assume that if those boogaloo accounts, you know, you can show that they

1807
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:38,820
were involved in X, Y, or Z and report them, they will be banned.

1808
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:42,940
They will be kicked off, I would assume.

1809
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:46,340
And I don't know who he's talking about, so I can't even fact check it.

1810
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:50,580
I can't go look for every account that has hashtag boogaloo in it and that's not even

1811
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:51,580
going to help.

1812
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:56,700
Then I have to go through hashtag big igloo, all the weird fun ways everybody spells things.

1813
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:57,700
I can't do that.

1814
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:58,700
Yeah.

1815
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,300
You're making a nonsense statement.

1816
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:03,900
It's almost like vague information from an unknown source.

1817
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:05,620
It's satanic.

1818
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:11,260
It's hard not to hear them saying like, okay, well we used to never have to think about

1819
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:12,840
how people feel.

1820
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:17,180
Then they started asking us to think about how we feel and we stormed the Capitol and

1821
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:21,380
now they're demanding that we think about how other people feel and they're giving us

1822
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:23,660
consequences when we don't.

1823
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:26,860
That sounds like exactly what they're saying, right?

1824
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:27,860
There's some overlap.

1825
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:28,860
Yeah.

1826
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:33,440
I find this to be sad.

1827
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:37,140
This was not a good couple of days for Alex.

1828
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:42,660
It wasn't even like, maybe he's holding back for the, you know, the long-

1829
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,620
For the marathon.

1830
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:50,900
The inauguration day, but like, I don't know, it's the last two days and like he mustered

1831
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:55,540
up his fake last show on the 19th, or I'm sorry, on the 18th and it was just sort of

1832
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:59,660
like, it wasn't anything, it was a, it was a real disappointing crescendo.

1833
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:02,020
I just got nothing.

1834
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:03,020
Yeah.

1835
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:04,660
I mean, that's not terrible.

1836
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:08,540
You know, you've had that day where you know that at the, at the end of the week, you're

1837
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:13,500
going to have the worst, like longest day and the day before that, the day before that,

1838
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,620
you're like, you know what, I'm going to take it easy today.

1839
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:19,680
I'm just going to do my job, but I'm not really going to, you know, go hard.

1840
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:24,140
I'm going to yell a little bit and then I'm going to-

1841
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:27,020
I got, I got a lot of things to scream about.

1842
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:32,060
I'm going to lie, but then I'm just going to take it easy, man.

1843
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:38,220
I imagine maybe he's been too busy writing that book about inner peace.

1844
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:48,340
I do think, even if everything sucks and nothing is really going on here, I would have done

1845
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:52,140
this episode just for that clip where Alex is gone.

1846
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,140
When Jason Jones-

1847
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:54,140
That's so good.

1848
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:55,140
That's so good.

1849
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:56,300
I just want that there.

1850
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,660
I will say this, I will make this pledge.

1851
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:03,100
If Alex does write that book, I will edit it for free, 100% for free.

1852
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:06,680
I will do an audio book of it in my Alex impression.

1853
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,680
That will be-

1854
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:08,680
Absolutely.

1855
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:09,680
Absolutely.

1856
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,620
That is the one thing we will do for Alex in our career.

1857
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:13,620
Breathe.

1858
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:19,900
We will be back, Jordan, with the inauguration spectacular 2020.

1859
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:20,900
Indeed.

1860
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:23,620
And I said 2020 because Alex, that's what's on the tombstone.

1861
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:26,340
Yes, I see that.

1862
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:29,660
We'll do that on Monday and I'm excited for that, but until then we have a website.

1863
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:30,660
We do have a website.

1864
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:31,660
It's knowledgefight.com.

1865
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:32,660
Yes.

1866
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:33,660
We're also on Twitter.

1867
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:34,660
We are on Twitter.

1868
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:35,660
It's at knowledgefight.net.

1869
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:36,660
Go to bed, Jordan.

1870
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:37,660
You're also on Facebook.

1871
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:43,100
And if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

1872
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:44,100
doing God's work.

1873
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,100
Yeah, we'll be back.

1874
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,100
But until then, I'm Neo.

1875
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:47,100
I'm Leo.

1876
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:48,100
I'm DZXClark.

1877
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:49,100
I'm Daryl Rundis.

1878
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:51,300
I am constantly fighting the devil.

1879
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:52,300
Andy in Kansas.

1880
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:53,300
You're on the air.

1881
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:54,300
Thanks for holding.

1882
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:55,300
Hello, Alex.

1883
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:56,300
I'm a first time caller.

1884
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,300
I'm a huge fan.

1885
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,300
I love your work.

1886
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:08,060
I love you.
