Hello Alex, I'm a true Simpler, I'm a huge fan.

00:51.680 --> 00:52.880
I love your world.

Knowledgefight.

00:53.760 --> 00:56.800
N-n-n-n-n-n-n-knowledgefight.com.

00:56.800 --> 01:07.800
I love you. Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fat, I'm Dan. I'm Jordan. We're a couple dudes, I like to sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk just a touch about Alex Jones. Just like a sprinkling to taste.

01:07.800 --> 01:20.800
I would say a smidge even. I would go so far as to say a smidge. Like pepper in a recipe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A sprinkle or perhaps a toss. A dusting of Alex. Indeed, just a hair. How are you doing Jordan?

01:20.800 --> 01:36.800
I'm subverting the form. I like it, I like it. How are you doing? Good. I have a question for you. What's that? What is your bright spot today? My bright spot today Jordan is I, first of all, I accept this already, don't fucking, I don't care, don't point a finger at me.

01:36.800 --> 01:54.800
This is preemptive defensiveness Dan, we've talked about this. It is. I'm a sucker for like Lovecraft themed horror video games. Of course. Like storytelling, that sort of thing. Eternal Darkness is one of my favorite video games of all time. Of course. It's great.

01:54.800 --> 02:07.800
Whenever we played Mansions of Madness together you get really into it. It's fantastic. I insist on holding the iPad so I can read the story. You love reading it to us? Yeah, you've got the whole thing. Doing the voice of the Lovecraftian narrator. Of course.

02:07.800 --> 02:24.800
I love it and so I was looking around for a cheap game. Bright Spots have just become video game reviews. At this point. I was looking for something in the five dollar range as I was trying to expand my horizons and I saw one called Lovecraft's Untold Stories.

02:24.800 --> 02:45.800
And I'm like, well, I'm a mark. I'm buying this. So I bought it. I'll send you a thousand dollars in the hopes of getting five thousand in return. If the letter is not from a Nigerian prince but it's from someone in Innsmouth then maybe, maybe I'm writing back. Miskatonic University would like a donation of your generous service. No, I'm an alum.

02:45.800 --> 03:11.800
I got it and I was really enjoying it and like the first level of it was pretty fun and then it got absurdly hard in the second level. Oh no. It got like unfair levels of heart. Okay. And I actually looked into it because I was like, this can't be right. Something's wrong. Right, right, right. And a bunch of the reviews online were all just like, this game is. This game gets unfairly hard at the second level.

03:11.800 --> 03:30.800
It's just like, this is not balanced. And it's true. Yeah. But it was also like not impossible. Sure. It was just really hard. Right, right, right, right. And I kind of, I was playing around with it a little bit and here's the bright spot was that I didn't back down to the difficulty. Nice.

03:30.800 --> 03:58.800
I kept trying and I learned and I realized like this is kind of how it used to be with video games. Oh totally. Like if you were playing Mega Man 2 that was fucking hard. It was impossible to do. It was so hard. Yeah. It has that sort of difficulty. Yeah. It's just like, it's really, it's, it's, it's fun. I enjoy it. Anyway. That's awesome. I did beat the second level. Love it. Love it. Congratulations. I felt like it was an actual achievement. Just something that I have not felt a ton in video games. Yeah. It's been a while.

03:58.800 --> 04:24.800
Yeah. A lot of these open world games that I enjoy are like, yeah, you get things done and maybe you beat a castle in a, or a, you know, a monastery in Assassin's Creed. And it's difficult. It can be. Yeah. But it's not hard. Yeah. It doesn't, it doesn't feel like, wow, I did that. Yeah. That second level. I fucking did that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it feels, yeah, achievement. That's so cool. Yeah. How about you?

04:24.800 --> 04:53.800
Uh, my bright spot, Dan, may sound counterintuitive, but I mean this wholeheartedly as a bright spot. Okay. My bright spot is failure. Oh. Uh, I, as you know. In a certain way, so was mine. Yeah. Well, I think that is kind of the, no, I think we share this. Uh, as you know, I started trying to stream a little bit of video games on Twitch. Yeah. And, uh, it has gone disastrous. People had asked what your channel is. I don't know if you gave the address. Oh, I haven't. It's, uh, it's Twitch TV, JB Holmes 3209.

04:53.800 --> 05:22.800
Okay. Yeah. That was the important thing. You get to find it. Sure. Well, there's that. I appreciate that not many people have found it because it has gone disastrously every time. Uh, the audio issues. It's a learning thing. Yeah. And it's, it's really, it's really fascinating cause it's fun to teach myself new stuff at 33. Like I've never touched the software on this before. I've never done all that stuff. It's fun to learn all the things that I'm terrible at and require new equipment for and all that stuff.

05:22.800 --> 05:43.800
And it reminded me of when I started doing standup of just like I failed for two years straight and as I'm doing this, I was so frustrated because I couldn't figure it out properly and I felt like I was disappointing the people who actually came to see it and I was really grateful to them and I wanted to do a good job for them and I failed miserably.

05:43.800 --> 05:59.800
And then I remembered I can fail so hard for so long and then eventually I got good at it to the point where I think I can do the same thing here. I mean, we failed quite a while doing this podcast. Totally, totally. Our streams did not always go.

05:59.800 --> 06:14.800
And now I think maybe you're getting a greater appreciation for why I have such a difficult time with being like, yeah, let's get back to doing live stream. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't want, I have so many headaches. I get it. But I wish you luck with that. I know you'll get it figured out and it'll be great and people will have fun watching the streams.

06:14.800 --> 06:26.800
I'm just excited because it also means that I'm trying new things, you know, and you can't expect to just be good out of the gate at new things. No, that's true. Yeah, it's been really good and humbling and I've appreciated it a lot.

06:26.800 --> 06:39.800
This is your second level of Lovecraft's Untold Stories. Exactly what it is. Challenging, maybe unfair. That's a little unfairly hard. 33 year old people anymore aren't supposed to be able to use computers. I think that's the rule.

06:39.800 --> 06:59.800
So Jordan, today we have an unexpected twist. Oh no. Alex is out of studio. No. On our last episode on Wednesday, I had said that today we were going to be listening to the end of Trump's presidency and inauguration day on Alex's show and I cannot deliver that.

06:59.800 --> 07:15.800
And I'll explain why. First reason. Alex's fake last episode thing carried over into this episode. Oh no. No, because you knew that. Oh, of course. On our last episode, when we talked about the 17th, Alex was saying tomorrow will be my fake last episode. No, of course.

07:15.800 --> 07:35.800
And so that was something that I couldn't not follow the thread of. Naturally. Then it turned out that on inauguration day, it was an all day affair. Right. So that's going to have to be on Monday. Okay. We're going to be covering January 20th on Monday. Today we're going to be talking about the 18th and the 19th, 2021. Blackjack. Blackjack, baby!

07:35.800 --> 08:04.800
No. End of show. No, baby. All right. And yeah, so we'll get to the inauguration on Monday. I just need a bit more time to prepare that because it's a lot of stuff to go through. A lot of disappointment. You don't have to listen to 12 hours. Well, I don't have to listen to all of it. Harrison Smith's hosting, I'm sure, a good bit of it. The Capitol has unfallen. Oh no. The Capitol is back in the arms of the globalists. Shit.

08:04.800 --> 08:26.800
So before we get down to business on today's episode, though, where we witnessed the last proper shows of the Trump time. Yes, even though there's two of them. Yeah, the 18th and the 19th. Yes. The last days when Trump could do something weird while Alex is on air. Before we get down to that, though, let's take a moment to say thank you to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show. Oh, that's a great idea.

08:26.800 --> 08:55.800
So first, Nathan S. Thank you so much. You're now Policy Wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Thank you, Nathan. Next, Disgruntled Honey Bee. Thank you so much. You are now Policy Wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Thank you very much. Disgruntled Honey Bee. Thank you. Next, Dave Endor's Donation Drive. Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Oh, that's a reference to my book, Dave Endor's Donation Drive. Oh, that's cute. Thank you. Thank you. Next, Nicholas L. and that's N-I-K-O-L-A-U-S. For my money, probably the best one.

08:55.800 --> 09:08.800
Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Thank you so much. You are now policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Thank you very much, Nicholas. Thank you next, Lee Green. Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Thanks, Lee Green.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.800
They go. Next, Kate K. Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk.

09:11.800 --> 09:12.800
I'm a policy wonk.

09:12.800 --> 09:13.800
Thank you, Kate.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.800
They go. Next, Thomas B. Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk.

09:16.800 --> 09:17.800
I'm a policy wonk.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.800
Thank you very much, Tommy B.

09:19.800 --> 09:23.800
And 1-800-NW-HOGS. Thank you so much. You are now a policy wonk.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.800
I'm a policy wonk.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.800
Thank you very much, 1-800-NW-HOGS.

09:27.800 --> 09:32.800
And finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on Elevated Love and we appreciate that very much.

09:32.800 --> 09:38.800
So first, Derek and that's spelled D-A-R-R-I-C-K. It's my money, the second best way to spell Derek.

09:38.800 --> 09:39.800
That's pretty great.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.800
It's up there. Maybe it's the best. I don't know.

09:40.800 --> 09:41.800
It's pretty up there.

09:41.800 --> 09:42.800
Thank you so much. You are now a technocrat.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.800
And the Waffle Witch. Thank you so much. You are now a technocrat.

09:46.800 --> 09:47.800
I'm a policy wonk.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.800
Crikey, mate. That's fantastic. Have yourself a brew.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.800
How's your 401k doing, bro?

09:52.800 --> 09:54.800
We gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

09:54.800 --> 09:58.800
Let's just get down to business. We ain't making that money off that heroin.

09:58.800 --> 09:59.800
Why you pimps so good?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.800
My neck is freakishly large.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.800
I declare info war on you.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.800
Thank you so much, Derek, and thank you so much to the Waffle Witch.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.800
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

10:08.800 --> 10:12.800
You know, a way you can blow people's minds is waffles.

10:12.800 --> 10:13.800
Yes, that's true.

10:13.800 --> 10:14.800
People don't realize how easy they are to make.

10:14.800 --> 10:15.800
They're delicious, too.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.800
And they're so cheap. Like, make a waffle iron.

10:18.800 --> 10:19.800
Yeah.

10:19.800 --> 10:20.800
Five bucks, probably.

10:20.800 --> 10:25.800
Also, Waffle Witch should be in a Miyazaki movie, if not already.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.800
And I would pay a lot to see it.

10:27.800 --> 10:31.800
I might have to fight the Waffle Witch and love her kinds of untold stories.

10:31.800 --> 10:35.800
That's level four. Super unfair.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.800
So, Jordan, here's an out of context drop from today's show.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.800
I'm at war with these people, not just on air.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.800
I'm constantly fighting them, and I'm not special.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.800
I'm just not dead inside.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.800
I will never let you eat Satan get me.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.800
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

10:51.800 --> 10:55.800
He always sounds exactly like the people that he says are demons.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.800
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

10:58.800 --> 10:59.800
Yeah, yeah.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.800
I just, you know, I don't know.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.800
It's hard to take someone seriously when they're like,

11:03.800 --> 11:05.800
I'm fighting the demons all the time.

11:05.800 --> 11:06.800
Yes, all the time.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.800
Yeah.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.800
All the time.

11:08.800 --> 11:09.800
Yeah.

11:09.800 --> 11:10.800
Nonstop.

11:10.800 --> 11:11.800
A little silly.

11:11.800 --> 11:12.800
Nonstop.

11:12.800 --> 11:13.800
My wife gets to go play tennis with her instructor,

11:13.800 --> 11:15.800
and I'm out here fighting demons all the time.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.800
Yeah.

11:16.800 --> 11:17.800
It's brutal.

11:17.800 --> 11:18.800
It's not fair.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.800
Yeah.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.800
So we start on the 18th, and of course, on the 17th,

11:21.800 --> 11:24.800
Alex had decided he was going to do his last show.

11:24.800 --> 11:25.800
Sure.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.800
Which he, again, already did last November.

11:27.800 --> 11:28.800
Right.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.800
This is between his third and fifth last show.

11:31.800 --> 11:32.800
Somewhere in that range.

11:32.800 --> 11:37.800
He decided on Saturday that he was going to do the last broadcast

11:37.800 --> 11:39.800
as he was in the middle of a show.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.800
So him and Mike Adams did a very dramatic show.

11:43.800 --> 11:44.800
Oh, yeah.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.800
I assume Mike Adams can never come back on.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.800
He was on the last broadcast.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.800
I mean, for good taste's sake, he can't.

11:49.800 --> 11:50.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:50.800 --> 11:51.800
He already gave his farewell address.

11:51.800 --> 11:56.800
So on that Saturday, Alex got distracted by Robert Barnes,

11:56.800 --> 11:59.800
the lawyer extraordinaire, coming in to yell about QAnon.

11:59.800 --> 12:00.800
Sure.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.800
And then Alex realized, like,

12:01.800 --> 12:02.800
ah, I can't do it today.

12:02.800 --> 12:03.800
I'm going to do it tomorrow.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.800
So on Sunday, he came in, did not do it.

12:05.800 --> 12:06.800
Went hot for it.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.800
Decided to point the finger at the Boogaloo Boys.

12:08.800 --> 12:09.800
Right.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.800
For the Capitol storming.

12:11.800 --> 12:12.800
Well, you got to do something.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.800
And then he's like, ah, I can't handle it.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.800
I'll do it tomorrow.

12:15.800 --> 12:20.800
So the 18th, Monday, is in theory supposed to be the last show.

12:20.800 --> 12:21.800
The last show ever.

12:21.800 --> 12:22.800
Right.

12:22.800 --> 12:23.800
The final broadcast.

12:23.800 --> 12:24.800
Great.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.800
Yeah.

12:25.800 --> 12:26.800
We're doing it.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.800
Here's where we start.

12:27.800 --> 12:32.800
New Jersey, where they tried to bankrupt that big successful gym,

12:32.800 --> 12:35.800
and they were starting to win in court.

12:35.800 --> 12:41.800
So the state just seized $150,000 every dime the company had to pay payroll

12:41.800 --> 12:45.800
and to pay for the bill on the building and to pay for the insurance.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.800
They barely had enough money to stay open,

12:47.800 --> 12:49.800
and now they're going to have to close.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.800
But they're starting to get cash donations.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.800
And all they got to do is call themselves a church or BLM,

12:55.800 --> 12:57.800
then they'll be protected under the First Amendment.

12:57.800 --> 13:02.800
And all of us should say, we're part of the Church of Freedom.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.800
In fact, I really think I'm going to incorporate a church.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.800
All I got to do is believe in freedom and a pro-human future,

13:08.800 --> 13:09.800
and you can be part of it.

13:09.800 --> 13:10.800
Okay.

13:10.800 --> 13:11.800
That was inevitable.

13:11.800 --> 13:12.800
Yeah.

13:12.800 --> 13:13.800
Yeah.

13:13.800 --> 13:14.800
It was about time.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.800
Honestly, this has taken too long to go full cult.

13:16.800 --> 13:17.800
Basically.

13:17.800 --> 13:18.800
Yeah.

13:18.800 --> 13:19.800
This is a church.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.800
Yeah.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.800
Why not?

13:21.800 --> 13:22.800
Yeah.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.800
No, I've literally shit all over the Satanists for not having a church,

13:24.800 --> 13:27.800
and they shouldn't have the protections of the First Amendment.

13:27.800 --> 13:28.800
But...

13:28.800 --> 13:31.800
He really screwed up not doing this when Trump was in office.

13:31.800 --> 13:32.800
Totally.

13:32.800 --> 13:36.800
Because Trump wasn't going to prosecute churches for 501c3 violations,

13:36.800 --> 13:38.800
but that might change.

13:38.800 --> 13:42.800
That might go back now to where you can't do political organizing

13:42.800 --> 13:44.800
in the guise of a church.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.800
I very much doubt it.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.800
So yeah, Alex doesn't want to pay taxes.

13:49.800 --> 13:50.800
No.

13:50.800 --> 13:51.800
That's basically the game here.

13:51.800 --> 13:52.800
Yeah.

13:52.800 --> 13:53.800
And yeah, finally getting around to it.

13:53.800 --> 13:54.800
I'm going to make a church.

13:54.800 --> 13:55.800
You're already a church.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.800
I don't know why Wesley Snipes never did the Church of Blade,

13:58.800 --> 14:00.800
because I would have joined the Church of Blade.

14:00.800 --> 14:01.800
Sure.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.800
I don't know how Alex isn't already a church.

14:03.800 --> 14:04.800
That's a good point.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.800
He constantly talks about God,

14:06.800 --> 14:11.800
and this show is a deeply religious thing where he thinks he's fighting demons all day.

14:11.800 --> 14:12.800
I don't know.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.800
It's either science fiction or religion, one of the two.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.800
Both of which could be a church.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.800
Because it ain't news and it ain't politics.

14:20.800 --> 14:21.800
Hey, if Elrond can do it.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.800
So Jordan, I don't know if you know this, but America is dead.

14:24.800 --> 14:25.800
Fair.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.800
It didn't die on the inauguration.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.800
Oh, that's good.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.800
And that's only because Alex misspeaks.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.800
Okay.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.800
You can definitely put on the tombstone,

14:34.800 --> 14:36.800
the United States of America,

14:36.800 --> 14:40.800
born July 4th, 1776.

14:40.800 --> 14:41.800
Not true.

14:41.800 --> 14:42.800
Died of treason.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.800
Died of infiltration.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.800
Died of Satanism.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.800
January 21st.

14:51.800 --> 14:52.800
The year 2020.

14:52.800 --> 14:53.800
Whoops.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.800
Still writing July on my checks.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.800
Wow, still writing July on those checks.

14:57.800 --> 14:58.800
Man.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.800
So I guess America's been dead for a year.

15:00.800 --> 15:04.800
And see, this is why you gotta double check before you put the death date on the tombstone.

15:04.800 --> 15:05.800
Yeah, of course.

15:05.800 --> 15:06.800
Because that's in rock.

15:06.800 --> 15:07.800
Yeah.

15:07.800 --> 15:12.800
America died before Bernie had to drop out of the race.

15:12.800 --> 15:13.800
Yeah.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.800
We couldn't even get a real socialist to kill America.

15:16.800 --> 15:21.800
I know that you were taking issue with him saying, you know, America was born July 4th, 1776.

15:21.800 --> 15:22.800
Sure.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.800
And I don't want to parse that right now.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.800
I have no interest in parsing that ever.

15:26.800 --> 15:33.800
What I do want to talk about is that this seems to imply that Alex doesn't believe that life begins at conception.

15:33.800 --> 15:44.800
It seems to me that this is an indication that birth is when life begins.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.800
If you're pro-nation, you're pro-choice.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.800
I think that's the reality.

15:48.800 --> 15:54.800
Or else you have to celebrate the Independence Day, the day when someone came up with the idea to have a country.

15:54.800 --> 15:55.800
Yeah.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.800
1617, somebody was like, man, I think we can do it.

15:58.800 --> 15:59.800
Yeah.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.800
Or maybe a thousand years before that, Eric the Red is out here.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.800
Man, I think these states should be united.

16:05.800 --> 16:14.800
Or just even the day that the beginning of the protesting against the crown began in the colonies.

16:14.800 --> 16:15.800
Then, I don't know.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.800
Anyway, I just thought that was kind of funny.

16:17.800 --> 16:22.800
America wasn't born when it became a twinkle in the eye of some revolutionary.

16:22.800 --> 16:26.800
I might have been fairly bored by Alex at the beginning of this episode.

16:26.800 --> 16:27.800
Sure, sure.

16:27.800 --> 16:28.800
And so I was having thoughts like that.

16:28.800 --> 16:29.800
Sure, you're having fun thoughts.

16:29.800 --> 16:30.800
Yeah.

16:30.800 --> 16:36.800
So Alex decides to talk about the One Ring.

16:36.800 --> 16:37.800
That's good.

16:37.800 --> 16:38.800
Sure.

16:38.800 --> 16:39.800
Yeah.

16:39.800 --> 16:43.800
The globalists, apparently they all want power in the rings that Sauron makes.

16:43.800 --> 16:44.800
Naturally.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.800
Give power to the ten kings with the ten rings.

16:47.800 --> 16:48.800
Nine rings.

16:48.800 --> 16:49.800
Whatever.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.800
But there's one to rule them.

16:50.800 --> 16:51.800
So that's the ten.

16:51.800 --> 16:52.800
Well, yes.

16:52.800 --> 16:53.800
But there's three for the elven lords.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.800
Right.

16:54.800 --> 16:55.800
Seven for the dwarf lords.

16:55.800 --> 16:56.800
I understand.

16:56.800 --> 16:57.800
Okay.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.800
Alex gives himself chills talking about this.

17:00.800 --> 17:01.800
Okay, okay.

17:01.800 --> 17:07.800
And so the globalist AI system is the enemy that is parasitically sucking the U.S. dry.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.800
And there's only a competition with globalists about who gets the AI takeover.

17:10.800 --> 17:15.800
It'll be China's AI or the U.S. AI, but it's Satan's plan that it's really all the same

17:15.800 --> 17:16.800
AI.

17:16.800 --> 17:17.800
The Lord of the Rings allegory.

17:17.800 --> 17:22.800
Ten rings given to ten kings of the earth who above all seek power.

17:22.800 --> 17:23.800
It's a Christian allegory.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.800
Tolkien said this about what he experienced.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.800
He specifically said it was not.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.500
A professor at the highest levels of the insider knowledge.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.500
Went out of his way.

17:31.500 --> 17:35.320
And so ten rings are given to ten kings for power.

17:35.320 --> 17:38.860
But when they take the power, they actually become enslaved.

17:38.860 --> 17:41.260
And there's one secret ring that controls them all.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.260
That's Satan.

17:42.260 --> 17:43.340
Not secret.

17:43.340 --> 17:45.300
That's a spiritual element.

17:45.300 --> 17:50.800
So, he's got chills.

17:50.800 --> 17:55.760
I believe it's nine rings given to mortal men.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.720
Doomed to die.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.760
Literally in the poem.

17:59.760 --> 18:00.760
Yeah.

18:00.760 --> 18:05.760
You make a good point about Tolkien really resisting allegory as well.

18:05.760 --> 18:06.760
Went hard on it.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.560
People were like, it's about the nuclear bomb, right?

18:08.560 --> 18:10.760
And he was like, oh, that's interesting.

18:10.760 --> 18:11.760
No.

18:11.760 --> 18:12.760
Yeah.

18:12.760 --> 18:15.400
He did say that it was a religious story.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.400
You know, it was a Christian story.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.400
Sure.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.840
Unintentionally at first and then intentionally upon reflection.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.000
Who's Jesus' hobbit friends?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.920
Who's Jesus' pippin?

18:26.920 --> 18:27.920
Pippin?

18:27.920 --> 18:31.640
That would be Bartholomew.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.760
I think that's a good answer.

18:33.760 --> 18:34.760
Yeah.

18:34.760 --> 18:40.080
I just love it anytime Alex is talking and he impresses himself or he freaks himself

18:40.080 --> 18:41.080
out.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.080
Ooh, got chills.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.080
Oh, man.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.080
Ooh.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.080
I nailed that.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.080
I absolutely got that one perfect.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.080
One ring?

18:47.080 --> 18:48.080
Satan.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.080
Yeah.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.080
Solved that problem.

18:50.080 --> 18:56.120
And there's still going on about how there's in the riot at the Capitol before the storming

18:56.120 --> 18:59.200
of January 6th, there were agents.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.200
Sure.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.200
Right?

19:01.200 --> 19:02.840
Everybody who might be inconvenient for him.

19:02.840 --> 19:03.840
Right.

19:03.840 --> 19:04.840
Probably an agent.

19:04.840 --> 19:05.840
That's Aragorn.

19:05.840 --> 19:06.840
But he can tell.

19:06.840 --> 19:07.840
Alex can tell.

19:07.840 --> 19:08.840
Sure.

19:08.840 --> 19:09.840
He has a special sense for this.

19:09.840 --> 19:13.320
I mean, you've got FBI agents in there running this damn thing.

19:13.320 --> 19:17.200
God, we're in so much trouble.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.480
And again, I'm not saying those guys, the agents, the guys with the Black Lives Matter

19:20.480 --> 19:25.480
and the Antifa shirts, it's the video you showed later of the people in full camo and

19:25.480 --> 19:30.760
full mask that are definitely got squared away there.

19:30.760 --> 19:34.280
And I can just tell you learn things, just look at them instantly.

19:34.280 --> 19:35.400
You know what's going on.

19:35.400 --> 19:39.280
This just makes me think of the time that we spent listening to the immediate aftermath

19:39.280 --> 19:40.280
of the Boston bombing.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.280
Yeah, totally.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.720
Whenever Alex was like, I can tell who everybody is just by looking at them.

19:44.720 --> 19:45.720
Yeah.

19:45.720 --> 19:49.480
Just by looking at the way they're standing and I know this guy's hostage rescue team

19:49.480 --> 19:50.480
all over.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.480
Yeah.

19:51.480 --> 19:52.480
You don't know shit.

19:52.480 --> 19:53.480
Here's my...

19:53.480 --> 19:59.040
I think Alex proves that the blood of Numenor has grown thin.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.040
Come on, man.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.040
All right.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.040
How many more do I got?

20:02.040 --> 20:04.640
I think you got way more, but I don't know how much patience I got.

20:04.640 --> 20:05.640
You don't want any more?

20:05.640 --> 20:06.640
No.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.640
Blackjack.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.640
Oh boy.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.640
Okay.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.240
So yeah, I mean, the people that he's talking about, I think, I don't know what the video

20:12.240 --> 20:16.480
he's referring to, but I assume based on the descriptions, probably the Oathkeeper folks

20:16.480 --> 20:17.480
who were there.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.480
Yeah, it has to.

20:18.480 --> 20:19.480
Yeah.

20:19.480 --> 20:23.080
But now it would be as good a time as any to talk about how Joe Biggs, former Infor's

20:23.080 --> 20:26.120
employee, Rambo Joe Biggs, he going to prison.

20:26.120 --> 20:27.120
Yeah.

20:27.120 --> 20:28.120
Hilarious.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.200
He's going to prison hard.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.200
For a while.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.200
Yeah.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.840
Unless he flips on a lot of more important people.

20:32.840 --> 20:33.840
And I don't even know.

20:33.840 --> 20:36.120
I don't even know if that's going to do much.

20:36.120 --> 20:37.120
I doubt it.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.120
Who's more important than him?

20:38.120 --> 20:40.000
He's like second in command of the Proud Boys.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.280
Yeah, that one's pretty easy to pick out.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.280
I don't know.

20:44.280 --> 20:50.560
What if he, I mean, I assume he can flip on some congressmen on account of them committing

20:50.560 --> 20:51.560
the crimes.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.560
Yeah.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.560
I don't know.

20:53.560 --> 20:54.560
Yeah.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.440
I don't know what he knows or what he's up to, but it's interesting to see this path

20:57.440 --> 21:01.280
that he's gone from.

21:01.280 --> 21:07.280
Ding dong working at Infowars trying to get Pizzagate going to the guy who gets Ted Cruz

21:07.280 --> 21:10.240
to finally go to prison.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.440
It's an interesting path.

21:12.440 --> 21:16.800
Also just before we got on air here today, on air, what the fuck am I talking about?

21:16.800 --> 21:17.800
No idea.

21:17.800 --> 21:22.320
Before we got on these mics, there was a news story that was breaking about William Watson,

21:22.320 --> 21:29.120
who's a guy who had a big beard, was pictured at the Capitol with, along with Q shaman.

21:29.120 --> 21:33.340
And a lot of the headlines were really stressing that he went to the Capitol because Alex told

21:33.340 --> 21:34.340
him to.

21:34.340 --> 21:35.340
Sure.

21:35.340 --> 21:38.240
Because people are making more out of that than they should.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.000
I don't think you can do much with that.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
No.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.200
I mean like, but I saw some people tweeting things to the effect of like, Alex ordered

21:46.200 --> 21:47.200
him to go.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.200
Sure.

21:48.200 --> 21:53.640
And even the Raw Story article about it, the phrasing of it was a little bit iffy.

21:53.640 --> 21:54.640
Yeah.

21:54.640 --> 21:58.480
Because as far as I can tell from the actual information, he just said that he knew that

21:58.480 --> 22:03.960
there was a rally at the Capitol because Alex had said, meet there at one, which you got

22:03.960 --> 22:10.160
to assume is Alex wanting people to go to the stage that he was conceivably going to

22:10.160 --> 22:11.880
be having a rally at.

22:11.880 --> 22:15.800
It would be nice, and we've referenced this before, it would be nice if before people

22:15.800 --> 22:19.720
ran with stories, they would at least like send you an email.

22:19.720 --> 22:22.960
But I mean, I imagine that the reason they don't is because you would be like, hey, could

22:22.960 --> 22:23.960
you add more nuance?

22:23.960 --> 22:27.080
And they'd be like, more nuance means fewer clicks, so we're not going to talk to Dan.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.080
Yeah.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.280
I mean, I don't know if I could even be of much help with this, but I wish people would

22:31.280 --> 22:37.260
recognize that like the more you put Alex in the crosshairs for this, when it's something

22:37.260 --> 22:42.440
like what you see in those stories about this guy, the more it works in Alex's favor.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.800
They're trying to set me up for this.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.840
And yeah, you shouldn't do things like that.

22:47.840 --> 22:51.680
They play into his- No, you wind up not just letting him off

22:51.680 --> 22:57.480
the hook, but doing a, I would call it pulling a Rogan, where you accidentally give him more

22:57.480 --> 23:00.700
credibility than he by any means deserves.

23:00.700 --> 23:03.360
You also write him a new narrative.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.360
Yeah.

23:04.360 --> 23:10.800
I mean, really, this is like a Son of Sam kind of stuff where it's like, oh, you can't

23:10.800 --> 23:12.480
blame the dog.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.480
You know what I'm saying?

23:13.480 --> 23:14.480
Or was that him?

23:14.480 --> 23:15.480
Yeah.

23:15.480 --> 23:18.640
I'm pretty sure the dog who was in, yeah, Satan and stuff.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.640
Yeah.

23:19.640 --> 23:20.640
Yeah.

23:20.640 --> 23:21.640
Alex is just Satan for this guy.

23:21.640 --> 23:22.640
No.

23:22.640 --> 23:23.640
The ring is Satan.

23:23.640 --> 23:24.640
Ah, that's fair.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.540
So I hated the beginning of this show.

23:26.540 --> 23:28.120
It was very boring.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.520
There was nothing going on.

23:29.520 --> 23:35.080
And thankfully, about an hour in, hour and 10, and Alex condenses what he's been talking

23:35.080 --> 23:36.240
about for the last hour.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.240
Okay, good.

23:37.240 --> 23:42.480
The whole last hour could have been condensed into two minutes.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.080
It's confirmed- The Alex Jones story.

23:44.080 --> 23:51.840
The deep state ran the Boogaloo boys via the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL and the FBI.

23:51.840 --> 23:52.840
No.

23:52.840 --> 23:53.840
You're back.

23:53.840 --> 23:54.840
To protect the Capitol.

23:54.840 --> 23:56.880
They've all bragged about it with Antifa.

23:56.880 --> 23:57.880
They've been protected.

23:57.880 --> 23:59.380
When they were arrested, they were released.

23:59.380 --> 24:02.140
It's been confirmed, apparently.

24:02.140 --> 24:07.680
That is a fair condensing of most of what he spent all of his time talking about.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.680
But he didn't prove any of this.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.340
He hasn't confirmed any of it.

24:11.340 --> 24:16.280
He just believes that saying something repeatedly is the same thing as confirming it.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.560
Hey, how about this?

24:17.560 --> 24:22.280
How about fuck your William Watson article, and instead, here's your article.

24:22.280 --> 24:25.060
Alex doesn't get to do this.

24:25.060 --> 24:30.600
And all you do is go through what he did on the sixth, and how he lied about it immediately,

24:30.600 --> 24:34.040
and how he's lying about it now, and how we don't get to let this go.

24:34.040 --> 24:38.300
He doesn't get to go on and talk about how there's going to be problems, and everybody's

24:38.300 --> 24:40.060
going to have their balls caught off.

24:40.060 --> 24:46.080
He has to say, I lied to you, and I was full of shit, and everybody should write an article

24:46.080 --> 24:47.260
about that.

24:47.260 --> 24:51.360
And also, there's a written article that in the lead mentions that he believes he's constantly

24:51.360 --> 24:52.360
fighting demons.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.360
And he believes he's constantly fighting demons.

24:53.360 --> 24:54.360
Yes.

24:54.360 --> 24:58.460
So he had the FBI, and through the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL, they were

24:58.460 --> 25:03.920
running the Boogaloo Boys to do all this and get the storming going.

25:03.920 --> 25:04.980
Weird, they were buddies.

25:04.980 --> 25:09.000
And then you had QAnon people who were patsies, apparently.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.420
They were just there to be a spectacle.

25:13.420 --> 25:15.400
And we walked right into a trap.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.400
They did stand down.

25:16.400 --> 25:23.040
They ushered the Q people, who were not violent, in to be killed and in to be arrested as sacrificial

25:23.040 --> 25:27.260
dummies, just like in Spies Like Us, a great comedy, but very accurate.

25:27.260 --> 25:30.940
You're like, oh, we're going to accelerate you guys to be frontline spies.

25:30.940 --> 25:31.940
You did that.

25:31.940 --> 25:32.940
With like two weeks training, yeah.

25:32.940 --> 25:33.940
You did that.

25:33.940 --> 25:34.940
And they put them in as decoys.

25:34.940 --> 25:37.860
Of course, they ended up doing a better job than the actual spies, which is how it actually

25:37.860 --> 25:38.860
works.

25:38.860 --> 25:43.100
Because real people get real stuff done, not you mentally ill sicko freaks that have Asperger's

25:43.100 --> 25:44.100
or whatever.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.100
Satanic Asperger's.

25:45.100 --> 25:46.100
I don't mean Asperger's or Satanic.

25:46.100 --> 25:50.100
I mean a form of it that's like Satanic.

25:50.100 --> 25:53.180
Disgusting.

25:53.180 --> 25:55.700
That was weird.

25:55.700 --> 25:58.420
So then you're saying that they did it.

25:58.420 --> 25:59.420
I don't know.

25:59.420 --> 26:02.820
He's saying that the real people at the Patriots did everything.

26:02.820 --> 26:05.380
I think he watched Spies Like Us recently.

26:05.380 --> 26:09.620
I think maybe his kids are coming to such an age that you've got to get into some of

26:09.620 --> 26:10.620
those classic comedies.

26:10.620 --> 26:11.620
That's fair.

26:11.620 --> 26:12.620
That's fair.

26:12.620 --> 26:13.620
Yeah.

26:13.620 --> 26:18.700
So I think one of the things that I'm noticing about Alex around this time is that it's pretty

26:18.700 --> 26:22.620
much just, it's very Doom filled.

26:22.620 --> 26:26.780
It's very much the country is no more.

26:26.780 --> 26:30.220
Well, I mean, in his cosmology, the devil has taken over the United States.

26:30.220 --> 26:31.980
So you would expect that kind of thing.

26:31.980 --> 26:32.980
Yeah.

26:32.980 --> 26:35.100
But you would expect it to be in that language.

26:35.100 --> 26:36.660
The devil is in charge.

26:36.660 --> 26:37.660
Well, yeah.

26:37.660 --> 26:39.220
He's been yelling about it for a long time.

26:39.220 --> 26:40.220
Yeah.

26:40.220 --> 26:43.280
But instead it kind of comes in this form and it's like, this is just going to incite

26:43.280 --> 26:44.780
people to impotent violence.

26:44.780 --> 26:48.340
We're going to come back and talk more about what you're witnessing there in our former

26:48.340 --> 26:50.300
Capitol now under globalist control.

26:50.300 --> 26:52.220
We are now officially occupied.

26:52.220 --> 26:58.820
Joe Biden will be installed in about 46 hours as the first dictator of the United States.

26:58.820 --> 26:59.820
Okay.

26:59.820 --> 27:01.300
And then we'll all be shut down after that.

27:01.300 --> 27:04.380
Shouldn't he think FDR was the first dictator of the United States?

27:04.380 --> 27:06.140
I managed to avoid a spit take.

27:06.140 --> 27:07.140
Yeah.

27:07.140 --> 27:08.140
I appreciate that.

27:08.140 --> 27:09.540
That was going to go straight at you.

27:09.540 --> 27:10.540
Yeah.

27:10.540 --> 27:11.900
That doesn't even fit with his own ideas.

27:11.900 --> 27:12.900
No, no.

27:12.900 --> 27:14.620
But DC is the former Capitol.

27:14.620 --> 27:16.900
We're now under complete occupation.

27:16.900 --> 27:17.900
Biden is a dictator.

27:17.900 --> 27:18.900
Naturally.

27:18.900 --> 27:26.540
It's all like, okay, well, what has your show for 25 fucking years suggested people do when

27:26.540 --> 27:28.380
those circumstances are achieved?

27:28.380 --> 27:29.380
Yeah.

27:29.380 --> 27:30.860
Well, I think you know.

27:30.860 --> 27:31.860
Yeah.

27:31.860 --> 27:35.300
So there's a couple of days left for Trump to be in office.

27:35.300 --> 27:36.300
Sure.

27:36.300 --> 27:38.620
He's got criminals to say you can go free.

27:38.620 --> 27:40.740
Well, actually, Alex has a prediction about that.

27:40.740 --> 27:41.740
Oh, strange.

27:41.740 --> 27:47.340
And I think with this type of action, Trump is going to pardon Julian Assange tomorrow.

27:47.340 --> 27:48.620
I'm predicting that right now.

27:48.620 --> 27:52.660
My gut tells me that Trump's good and the Trump at the final crucible do the right thing.

27:52.660 --> 27:57.020
Ooh, snake eyes came up just short on my prediction note.

27:57.020 --> 28:00.340
Headline, you don't get to do this.

28:00.340 --> 28:04.540
Alex, probably very disappointed about that.

28:04.540 --> 28:05.540
Yeah.

28:05.540 --> 28:06.540
Yeah.

28:06.540 --> 28:07.540
Why did he think that would happen?

28:07.540 --> 28:08.540
I don't know.

28:08.540 --> 28:09.780
Probably because it's what his audience wants to hear.

28:09.780 --> 28:10.780
Well, that's fair.

28:10.780 --> 28:16.380
So Alex is getting, we heard on that Sunday show, he's getting back into the migrant caravan

28:16.380 --> 28:17.820
fear based narratives.

28:17.820 --> 28:18.820
Naturally.

28:18.820 --> 28:19.820
Naturally.

28:19.820 --> 28:25.140
And one of the things that I've noticed about him is he has an absolute inability to estimate

28:25.140 --> 28:26.500
sizes of groups.

28:26.500 --> 28:27.500
Yeah.

28:27.500 --> 28:28.500
Yeah.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.420
He will say like 100,000 people is 10 million.

28:30.420 --> 28:31.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:31.420 --> 28:34.640
You ever do those, how many gumballs in this jar?

28:34.640 --> 28:36.660
He guesses a million every time.

28:36.660 --> 28:37.660
Or seven.

28:37.660 --> 28:38.660
Yeah.

28:38.660 --> 28:40.780
He's not good at estimating.

28:40.780 --> 28:41.780
No, no, no.

28:41.780 --> 28:47.020
He's saying, he's looking at a picture of like a caravan of migrants and he's just like,

28:47.020 --> 28:48.580
oh, that's so many more people.

28:48.580 --> 28:52.100
And if you don't admit it's the end of America, it will be.

28:52.100 --> 28:55.940
By admitting we're under attack, by admitting this is globalist, by admitting that they've

28:55.940 --> 29:00.860
collapsed the third world with the COVID lockdowns and now the UN has set up giant refugee centers

29:00.860 --> 29:05.500
to make the hundreds of thousands that caravan here a few years ago that Trump stopped look

29:05.500 --> 29:09.020
like insignificant.

29:09.020 --> 29:13.180
Let's go ahead for radio listeners, any viewers can see this, roll that little newscast about

29:13.180 --> 29:16.100
the 7,000 folks that is the 7,000.

29:16.100 --> 29:18.160
Let me give you a newsflash.

29:18.160 --> 29:20.500
It's 50,000.

29:20.500 --> 29:25.420
I've seen the footage and that's just the first group, the UN trains, they've got debit

29:25.420 --> 29:27.820
cards paid for by the state department.

29:27.820 --> 29:31.220
Trump cut off the money, but now they do it directly from Soros and I'm gonna go to your

29:31.220 --> 29:32.980
phone calls, but that's what's happening.

29:32.980 --> 29:33.980
Prove it.

29:33.980 --> 29:34.980
Prove any of that shit.

29:34.980 --> 29:38.500
Anyway, look, I noticed this and I hate it.

29:38.500 --> 29:46.420
It sucks, but I think that these sorts of stories really get under Alex's skin more

29:46.420 --> 29:52.940
than a lot of other ones because he gets really mad for a large chunk of this episode.

29:52.940 --> 29:56.100
Al, the border's close to his home and he's a racist.

29:56.100 --> 29:58.260
The end.

29:58.260 --> 30:06.020
He's really, really like just down and like he freaks out quite a bit.

30:06.020 --> 30:08.980
And that does get- Might have to see two more Muslims than I'm

30:08.980 --> 30:09.980
used to.

30:09.980 --> 30:10.980
At the pool supply shop.

30:10.980 --> 30:11.980
Yeah, exactly.

30:11.980 --> 30:12.980
Yeah.

30:12.980 --> 30:16.820
So he addresses the idea that this was gonna be his last show and then he just goes downhill

30:16.820 --> 30:17.820
from there.

30:17.820 --> 30:18.820
Okay.

30:18.820 --> 30:19.820
All right.

30:19.820 --> 30:20.820
All right.

30:20.820 --> 30:21.820
I'm gonna go to break and I promise for at least four segments, three segments, I'm gonna

30:21.820 --> 30:22.820
go write the calls.

30:22.820 --> 30:28.540
I'm gonna go to Michael, Steve, John, Christian, Houston, Scott, Preston, Izzy, Richard and

30:28.540 --> 30:29.540
others.

30:29.540 --> 30:32.820
And listen, I want to explain something here to everybody.

30:32.820 --> 30:33.820
Okay?

30:33.820 --> 30:36.780
It might seem really irritable and mad it's not with the crew.

30:36.780 --> 30:38.940
I'm just done with all this.

30:38.940 --> 30:44.180
And I meant to come here today and say this is my last broadcast.

30:44.180 --> 30:46.020
And by that, I'm gonna keep doing shows.

30:46.020 --> 30:49.340
But I mean, you understand folks, I believe they're gonna shut everything down the next

30:49.340 --> 30:50.340
few months.

30:50.340 --> 30:51.500
They're gonna blow up federal buildings.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.700
They're gonna put poison in water supplies.

30:53.700 --> 30:54.700
I mean, it's over.

30:54.700 --> 30:56.460
I mean, it's over.

30:56.460 --> 30:57.460
You understand?

30:57.460 --> 31:00.180
Your only shot you've got is realizing that we're screwed.

31:00.180 --> 31:02.220
Your candy ass church isn't gonna do it.

31:02.220 --> 31:04.020
Your candy ass boss isn't gonna do it.

31:04.020 --> 31:07.100
We're a trained group of monkeys in this country.

31:07.100 --> 31:08.740
We're not what Americans used to be.

31:08.740 --> 31:10.220
We're not rugged individualists.

31:10.220 --> 31:12.540
We don't stand up for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.

31:12.540 --> 31:14.120
We're a joke, okay?

31:14.120 --> 31:16.420
So he's in a bad mood.

31:16.420 --> 31:17.420
Yeah.

31:17.420 --> 31:22.260
That bad mood has started after covering this story about the migrants.

31:22.260 --> 31:23.260
Yeah.

31:23.260 --> 31:27.140
And it turns pretty fucking extreme.

31:27.140 --> 31:31.780
I mean, he's talking about blowing up federal buildings, poisoning the water supply and

31:31.780 --> 31:32.780
like...

31:32.780 --> 31:34.820
I don't think even Stone Cold called churches candy asses.

31:34.820 --> 31:37.500
No, and it was The Rock who called people candy asses.

31:37.500 --> 31:38.500
Oh, I apologize.

31:38.500 --> 31:41.900
I apologize for not getting famous Republican The Rock.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.660
You did speak at the RNC.

31:44.660 --> 31:46.220
Yeah, exactly.

31:46.220 --> 31:50.620
Yeah, so Alex goes from there, how they're gonna do all this shit.

31:50.620 --> 31:53.620
Yeah, we're all just gonna let The Rock get away with that, right?

31:53.620 --> 31:56.140
Everybody's just agreed, like, eh, don't worry about it.

31:56.140 --> 32:00.740
Sure, The Rock endorsed all of the horrifying things, but we'll still let him be a movie

32:00.740 --> 32:01.740
star.

32:01.740 --> 32:05.260
I mean, sure, I don't know what his politics are anymore.

32:05.260 --> 32:06.260
Sure.

32:06.260 --> 32:07.260
And I don't know what...

32:07.260 --> 32:08.260
I don't know how...

32:08.260 --> 32:10.660
Look, Vince McMahon is a lunatic.

32:10.660 --> 32:12.260
Yeah, that's true.

32:12.260 --> 32:13.260
That is true.

32:13.260 --> 32:14.260
That's all...

32:14.260 --> 32:15.260
I don't know.

32:15.260 --> 32:18.900
I'm not gonna sit here and defend The Rock, but I'm also not gonna say that I know.

32:18.900 --> 32:19.900
I'm not gonna?

32:19.900 --> 32:22.700
He did speak at the RNC, but that was also 20 years ago?

32:22.700 --> 32:23.980
Eh, that's fair.

32:23.980 --> 32:28.780
Anyway, Alex gets deeper into Doom fantasies.

32:28.780 --> 32:33.340
I mean, if we ever beat this thing, it'll be in the history of, like, these people were

32:33.340 --> 32:34.340
Hitler.

32:34.340 --> 32:35.340
I mean, this is unbelievable.

32:35.340 --> 32:40.060
It's not like, oh, we're getting there, it's bad, things are out of control.

32:40.060 --> 32:41.060
It's...

32:41.060 --> 32:42.500
They've just begun.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.040
They're gonna take your pension funds.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.040
They're gonna bankrupt.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.160
They're gonna cut the power off, the oil off.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.380
They're gonna open the borders.

32:48.380 --> 32:49.700
It's over, man.

32:49.700 --> 32:50.700
It's over.

32:50.700 --> 32:51.700
It's all gone.

32:51.700 --> 32:52.700
It's all over.

32:52.700 --> 32:56.420
They're gonna activate the Boogaloos, FBI, ADL, terror forces.

32:56.420 --> 32:57.940
They're gonna start blowing everything up.

32:57.940 --> 33:00.060
Then they're gonna come arrest all the patriots.

33:00.060 --> 33:01.060
The idiots will cheer it.

33:01.060 --> 33:03.140
Then they're gonna shut your power off.

33:03.140 --> 33:04.780
They want you starving in the street.

33:04.780 --> 33:05.780
They wanna rape your wife.

33:05.780 --> 33:06.780
They're Bolsheviks.

33:06.780 --> 33:07.780
They're Jacobins.

33:07.780 --> 33:08.780
You're...

33:08.780 --> 33:09.780
I wish.

33:09.780 --> 33:10.780
It's all over, man.

33:10.780 --> 33:11.780
All over.

33:11.780 --> 33:12.780
Enjoy.

33:12.780 --> 33:13.780
All your games.

33:13.780 --> 33:17.260
In fact, America is rotting and deserves it.

33:17.260 --> 33:19.540
Now, the Satanists aren't good.

33:19.540 --> 33:20.540
They're not God.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.740
God just lets them have their way now.

33:22.740 --> 33:25.020
So all your games are over.

33:25.020 --> 33:29.700
All the TV watching, all the laziness, all the slack-jawing's over.

33:29.700 --> 33:30.700
It's over.

33:30.700 --> 33:35.500
You're gonna be just like a baby at six months being chopped up in its mother's womb.

33:35.500 --> 33:36.500
You're not a human.

33:36.500 --> 33:37.500
You're not essential.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.500
You're dead.

33:38.500 --> 33:42.940
They're gonna kill you, because you don't care.

33:42.940 --> 33:47.220
There's so much hand sanitizer on the market, but beware.

33:47.220 --> 33:48.220
So...

33:48.220 --> 33:53.240
Yeah, that was a jarring shift into that commercial.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.240
Never not fun.

33:54.240 --> 34:00.700
Yeah, so I guess we should not storm capital buildings then if we're all, you know...

34:00.700 --> 34:02.260
I don't understand.

34:02.260 --> 34:12.000
If I recall correctly, I do believe that Alex said God appointed him to defeat Satan.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.780
And he was the only person that Satan was worried about.

34:14.780 --> 34:19.980
Yeah, and that's why Satan tried to recruit him when he was younger with all the hot cheerleaders.

34:19.980 --> 34:24.860
So I mean, now that he's done, I assume Satan's like, whew, dodged a bullet on that one.

34:24.860 --> 34:27.780
I guess God isn't that powerful now, is he?

34:27.780 --> 34:30.540
Well, look, don't blame God for Alex's failures.

34:30.540 --> 34:34.280
I'm pretty sure that that's the only person you can blame.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.540
This is an HR issue.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.220
His prophecies are shit.

34:37.220 --> 34:39.620
I don't believe God at all anymore, Dan.

34:39.620 --> 34:45.060
I do think that if you take everything Alex says seriously, then yes, he has been defeated

34:45.060 --> 34:47.140
by the devil at this point.

34:47.140 --> 34:49.340
And by extension, so has God.

34:49.340 --> 34:55.700
Yeah, but also I could see a world where God is sitting off at the side, he's like, I didn't

34:55.700 --> 34:56.700
tell you to do that.

34:56.700 --> 34:58.180
Nah, I can see that world too.

34:58.180 --> 34:59.980
Hey, Alex, don't keep my name out of your mouth.

34:59.980 --> 35:01.300
I didn't tell you to do anything.

35:01.300 --> 35:05.780
Hey, buddy, pssst, guess who you've been working for the whole time, you idiot?

35:05.780 --> 35:06.900
Yeah, yeah.

35:06.900 --> 35:10.740
You're controlled opposition for the devil.

35:10.740 --> 35:12.420
Alex Jones is a devil of false flag.

35:12.420 --> 35:14.300
Yeah, that does sound right.

35:14.300 --> 35:22.940
So Alex believes that everyone in the news, like all over MSM, sure.

35:22.940 --> 35:27.580
Everyone's calling for Trump people to be thrown in camps, Trump fans, just people who

35:27.580 --> 35:28.580
like him.

35:28.580 --> 35:35.500
What kind of people who bad ones like, like offsite FEMA, FEMA, all right.

35:35.500 --> 35:40.460
Five years ago, if we had one club of national TV saying, let's put people in reeducation

35:40.460 --> 35:45.260
camps, we'd be airing in every segment, I probably saw five clips this morning of national

35:45.260 --> 35:51.340
news saying, when you do arrest all supporters and reeducate them right now for no reason.

35:51.340 --> 35:56.860
You said if you had one clip, we need emergency legislation, we need the States lining up

35:56.860 --> 35:57.860
against this.

35:57.860 --> 35:59.900
We need all the big churches coming out against it.

35:59.900 --> 36:04.920
We need all the men that I see on the golf courses are polishing their Porsches or their

36:04.920 --> 36:09.080
jet boats to spend some time caring about this.

36:09.080 --> 36:10.080
Don't you have boats?

36:10.080 --> 36:17.060
All the successful men keep their heads down and it makes me sick because you're not successful.

36:17.060 --> 36:20.780
You're the ones that took our birthright and crapped it away.

36:20.780 --> 36:21.860
That's why I'm pissed, man.

36:21.860 --> 36:24.520
I'm really pissed off right now.

36:24.520 --> 36:26.640
We got a case of communist cancer.

36:26.640 --> 36:31.820
So again, Alex is furious that rich people aren't doing more to support the info war

36:31.820 --> 36:32.820
or something.

36:32.820 --> 36:35.820
I think you can read between the lines a little bit on that.

36:35.820 --> 36:36.820
Yeah.

36:36.820 --> 36:39.420
We've heard this chorus before.

36:39.420 --> 36:47.140
I do think that this is him trying to do like a posterity last broadcast, like the fake

36:47.140 --> 36:48.140
last broadcast thing.

36:48.140 --> 36:49.140
He's getting really mad.

36:49.140 --> 36:51.660
He's trying to get his Howard Beale moment.

36:51.660 --> 36:53.380
Mad as hell, not going to take it anymore.

36:53.380 --> 36:54.380
Never.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.380
Kind of thing.

36:55.380 --> 36:59.580
And it's really funny because he starts time traveling.

36:59.580 --> 37:02.100
His mind starts traveling through time.

37:02.100 --> 37:05.380
He brings out a story from 2008 and pretends it's current.

37:05.380 --> 37:06.380
I'm excited.

37:06.380 --> 37:09.820
I mean, this is it, folks.

37:09.820 --> 37:12.060
I start thinking about all the things I want to say and all the things I want to do and

37:12.060 --> 37:17.100
it just makes me mad that our precious country is being literally sucked into a black hole

37:17.100 --> 37:21.900
of world government.

37:21.900 --> 37:25.700
Literally.

37:25.700 --> 37:28.700
God.

37:28.700 --> 37:34.020
You understand they are announcing shock collars and shock bracelets and bracelets and dog

37:34.020 --> 37:36.620
collars for everyone to wear, OK?

37:36.620 --> 37:41.020
I mean, I have the newscast from 2008.

37:41.020 --> 37:46.020
The plan is they're going to be shocking callers, but it was, oh, you're wearing a collar now

37:46.020 --> 37:49.220
to show your COVID thing and attracts you and social businesses.

37:49.220 --> 37:50.220
No, no, no.

37:50.220 --> 37:54.940
The actual meetings are about having a shocker in it and the public's like, I love my shocker.

37:54.940 --> 37:55.940
I'm not joking.

37:55.940 --> 38:01.380
No, but you're talking about a 13 year old news story about something that the DHS was

38:01.380 --> 38:03.520
considering and didn't implement.

38:03.520 --> 38:04.520
There is that.

38:04.520 --> 38:06.420
This is so sad.

38:06.420 --> 38:07.420
There is that.

38:07.420 --> 38:08.420
Yeah.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.420
That might be an issue.

38:09.420 --> 38:12.620
And I actually know that that's exactly what he's talking about, because we heard him talk

38:12.620 --> 38:14.860
about that in the past episodes.

38:14.860 --> 38:15.860
And...

38:15.860 --> 38:18.500
No, the problem is, Dan, liberals don't have any memories.

38:18.500 --> 38:19.500
Right.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.940
But I also heard him bring it up on this episode.

38:21.940 --> 38:22.940
Sure.

38:22.940 --> 38:26.300
This same episode, he talks about how they were going to do that for anti-terrorism in

38:26.300 --> 38:27.300
2008.

38:27.300 --> 38:28.300
I hate it.

38:28.300 --> 38:30.460
And he remembers it and then he incorporates it into the present narrative.

38:30.460 --> 38:31.460
I hate him so much.

38:31.460 --> 38:32.460
Yeah, he's the worst.

38:32.460 --> 38:33.460
Yeah.

38:33.460 --> 38:36.580
And there's some content warning, I guess, about this.

38:36.580 --> 38:40.500
This next clip is pretty gross, but it's Alex freaking out.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.560
He's now super mad.

38:42.560 --> 38:46.520
He's losing his mind, starts complaining more about shock collars.

38:46.520 --> 38:50.140
Are they shock collars like what we're used to, or are they collars that just explain

38:50.140 --> 38:51.940
what is happening with climate change?

38:51.940 --> 38:57.680
They're shocking collars in the sense that they are, like, garish.

38:57.680 --> 38:58.680
They're collars that are just...

38:58.680 --> 38:59.680
They're bedazzled.

38:59.680 --> 39:00.680
Yes.

39:00.680 --> 39:01.680
They're like, ooh, you can't wear that.

39:01.680 --> 39:04.500
They're like slap bracelets and people are shocked you're still wearing them.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.500
Yeah.

39:05.500 --> 39:06.500
Gotcha.

39:06.500 --> 39:08.700
So, there's more talk about shock collars here, and then Alex brings in a little bit

39:08.700 --> 39:14.420
of his fears and disgusting stuff about drag queen story time.

39:14.420 --> 39:15.420
Oh, God.

39:15.420 --> 39:16.420
Which is...

39:16.420 --> 39:17.420
You don't get to do this!

39:17.420 --> 39:21.300
It's been a while, and this ends predictably.

39:21.300 --> 39:26.460
Not communist China, Homeland Security is having meetings about shockers you wear around

39:26.460 --> 39:27.460
your neck.

39:27.460 --> 39:28.460
13 years ago.

39:28.460 --> 39:34.300
I mean, hell, you let convicted pedophiles go to elementary schools and have your six-year-old

39:34.300 --> 39:37.660
daughters and sons bounce up and down on their erections.

39:37.660 --> 39:41.420
I mean, literally, I watch these videos.

39:41.420 --> 39:42.740
We can't even air these on air.

39:42.740 --> 39:47.540
I can't even look at them of some fat pot-bellied dude with a little six-year-old girl on him

39:47.540 --> 39:49.980
riding his crotch, and he's got an erection.

39:49.980 --> 39:51.340
This is what they do on TV.

39:51.340 --> 39:55.060
And then they cut to the local newscaster and he goes, well, got to get them when they're

39:55.060 --> 39:56.060
young.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.060
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

39:57.060 --> 39:58.060
See, he's the leader.

39:58.060 --> 39:59.060
He just goes along with it.

39:59.060 --> 40:01.180
Got to get the children when they're young, huh?

40:01.180 --> 40:05.620
Do you think you're safe in a world where they got kids with pedophiles on TV?

40:05.620 --> 40:11.660
Do you think you're safe, you dumb son of a bitch?

40:11.660 --> 40:13.100
Hmm, maybe.

40:13.100 --> 40:14.420
You think they're safe when they're...

40:14.420 --> 40:17.860
Now we know the COVID vaccine kills old people at a very high percentage rate.

40:17.860 --> 40:20.300
You think we're safe when they're killing all the old people?

40:20.300 --> 40:27.860
And do you think God likes us when we do that?

40:27.860 --> 40:30.980
It's all going to burn.

40:30.980 --> 40:33.840
All of you that think you're smart and you're part of the system is you can manipulate those

40:33.840 --> 40:34.840
under you.

40:34.840 --> 40:37.820
It's all going to come back on you a trillion fold.

40:37.820 --> 40:43.780
And I'm just saying right now, I will not be part of this.

40:43.780 --> 40:47.740
I will not submit to it.

40:47.740 --> 40:52.060
You know, simply safe sells a social distancing sweater.

40:52.060 --> 40:57.380
All right, I said I'd go to your calls.

40:57.380 --> 41:00.460
Show them the Homeland Security video where you wear taser bracelets.

41:00.460 --> 41:02.340
I'm not making this up, folks.

41:02.340 --> 41:03.780
I know I'm saying this stuff.

41:03.780 --> 41:05.140
It just sounds fantastic.

41:05.140 --> 41:08.020
I'm not lying.

41:08.020 --> 41:09.980
Is there a solution to hijacking?

41:09.980 --> 41:14.300
Yes, everyone will wear a shocking bracelet, Homeland Security says.

41:14.300 --> 41:15.300
It's okay.

41:15.300 --> 41:17.180
Only if you're bad will the stir to shock you.

41:17.180 --> 41:18.700
Oh, I'm sorry.

41:18.700 --> 41:25.500
The flight attendant, don't put me in a reeducation center.

41:25.500 --> 41:26.500
Put them in a reeducation center.

41:26.500 --> 41:27.500
Okay.

41:27.500 --> 41:31.580
I'm going to just say this and go to a call.

41:31.580 --> 41:35.340
It could be your last chance to get an Infowars t-shirt, a Trader Joe's t-shirt, shows his

41:35.340 --> 41:39.220
countries he's sold out to, to be your last chance to get X2, X3.

41:39.220 --> 41:45.720
Wow, that really just really drives home the sincerity of that entire rant, like really

41:45.720 --> 41:48.780
feels genuine and organic and real.

41:48.780 --> 41:50.620
You don't get to do this!

41:50.620 --> 41:55.120
It doesn't feel like a performance at all meant to heighten people's emotions, put them

41:55.120 --> 42:00.540
in a suggestible state, wherein they might be like, oh no, I got to buy this t-shirt.

42:00.540 --> 42:03.420
You know, I think this is why I really don't care.

42:03.420 --> 42:07.780
Like I've seen a lot of like, a lot of those takes where it's like, no, you need to feel

42:07.780 --> 42:08.820
for the Q people.

42:08.820 --> 42:12.800
They really believe this is real and that, and that's why, you know, I know you don't

42:12.800 --> 42:17.260
think that they should, and it's like, man, I get it.

42:17.260 --> 42:18.660
I get it.

42:18.660 --> 42:23.700
I care because a child believes that the boogeyman is under the bed.

42:23.700 --> 42:24.700
I care.

42:24.700 --> 42:27.700
If I'm going to be held as a child, I'm going to do, I'm going to be like, hey, no, there's

42:27.700 --> 42:28.980
no boogeyman under the bed.

42:28.980 --> 42:30.200
Let's do this.

42:30.200 --> 42:31.200
You're an adult.

42:31.200 --> 42:32.200
I don't care.

42:32.200 --> 42:34.100
I don't care if you believe that the boogeyman is under the bed.

42:34.100 --> 42:35.300
I just don't care.

42:35.300 --> 42:37.240
You're an adult.

42:37.240 --> 42:41.140
Many of you people are middle-aged or older.

42:41.140 --> 42:43.380
Stop believing that there's a boogeyman under the bed.

42:43.380 --> 42:47.820
Yeah, but you're not taking into account nearly enough how belief that there's a boogeyman

42:47.820 --> 42:52.820
under your bed gives you security and fills an emotional hole that you need filled.

42:52.820 --> 42:59.740
And you don't realize that it's being filled by something as false and nonsensical as a

42:59.740 --> 43:00.820
boogeyman under your bed.

43:00.820 --> 43:02.000
I realize that.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.020
You may, but I don't feel like you're empathizing to that.

43:06.020 --> 43:07.020
I'm not.

43:07.020 --> 43:09.980
I'm thoroughly not because they're not children.

43:09.980 --> 43:12.020
That's okay, and that's your right.

43:12.020 --> 43:13.060
I disagree with you.

43:13.060 --> 43:14.540
I understand that.

43:14.540 --> 43:21.620
So if we're pretending that this is Alex's last show, one of the things that he would

43:21.620 --> 43:26.180
obviously do in this last show is put off going to calls and not really get around to

43:26.180 --> 43:27.180
them.

43:27.180 --> 43:28.180
Oh yeah, of course.

43:28.180 --> 43:31.520
And so he does successfully do that by screaming about all sorts of stuff.

43:31.520 --> 43:37.020
And then he finally does get to calls, and in normal caller fashion, they're kind of

43:37.020 --> 43:38.840
a bummer.

43:38.840 --> 43:45.780
This one guy who calls in has been in the capital, in DC, since the 6th.

43:45.780 --> 43:46.780
Not the building.

43:46.780 --> 43:47.780
Okay.

43:47.780 --> 43:48.780
Excuse me.

43:48.780 --> 43:49.780
All right.

43:49.780 --> 43:50.780
Okay.

43:50.780 --> 43:56.700
So he's really struggling to understand why Trump would go away.

43:56.700 --> 44:02.020
Why would he get on an airplane and give up on being president if we know the election

44:02.020 --> 44:03.020
was stolen?

44:03.020 --> 44:04.020
Right.

44:04.020 --> 44:05.020
If we know these people are demons.

44:05.020 --> 44:06.020
Right.

44:06.020 --> 44:07.020
Why would he do that?

44:07.020 --> 44:08.020
It's tough.

44:08.020 --> 44:09.020
Yeah.

44:09.020 --> 44:13.540
So I got the call from the president to be here on January 6th, and I'm still here.

44:13.540 --> 44:15.500
Well, God bless you, brother.

44:15.500 --> 44:16.500
What do you see there?

44:16.500 --> 44:17.500
What's unfolded?

44:17.500 --> 44:19.900
I see a lot of buses.

44:19.900 --> 44:22.940
A lot of buses with the tinted windows.

44:22.940 --> 44:29.100
And I'm hoping that there are troops, real troops, US soldiers.

44:29.100 --> 44:34.460
One thing that you're not mentioning at all is where's Trump?

44:34.460 --> 44:39.460
If he doesn't say something and start the insurrection act or something to slow this

44:39.460 --> 44:44.180
down, this will be worse than the Bay of Pigs.

44:44.180 --> 44:45.180
I hear you.

44:45.180 --> 44:47.500
That's what I'm saying is he's surrounded.

44:47.500 --> 44:49.220
No one is supporting him.

44:49.220 --> 44:52.100
The cube movement was to make people think he was invincible.

44:52.100 --> 44:54.440
They set us up on the 6th to demonize us.

44:54.440 --> 44:55.440
You said he was chosen by God.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.820
So Trump's going to have Trump's going to leave.

44:57.820 --> 45:01.380
I mean, that's what's going down here, brother, those troops.

45:01.380 --> 45:02.660
But here's the weird wrinkle.

45:02.660 --> 45:04.460
They're now saying the troops are terrorists.

45:04.460 --> 45:07.900
Fox News is saying and CNN's reporting they don't trust the troops either.

45:07.900 --> 45:09.420
So who knows what's going on up there?

45:09.420 --> 45:10.420
I mean, this is crazy, brother.

45:10.420 --> 45:12.340
We're about to find out, aren't we?

45:12.340 --> 45:14.060
We the people know what the truth is.

45:14.060 --> 45:15.540
We know there was election fraud.

45:15.540 --> 45:17.560
We know COVID is a hoax.

45:17.560 --> 45:19.980
We know there's a rampant pedophilia going on.

45:19.980 --> 45:22.220
We know Epstein didn't kill himself.

45:22.220 --> 45:25.880
We know we didn't send help for the Benghazi soldiers.

45:25.880 --> 45:29.980
We know that Joe Biden sent a senile.

45:29.980 --> 45:30.980
What in the heck?

45:30.980 --> 45:35.240
How can a man get on a plane and fly away from all of this?

45:35.240 --> 45:38.180
He also said he would never surrender.

45:38.180 --> 45:42.200
So I'm here in the belly of the beast waiting for the command.

45:42.200 --> 45:43.460
That's so sad.

45:43.460 --> 45:46.020
That just really bums me out.

45:46.020 --> 45:51.060
That's a guy who's accepted and internalized all of these, these narratives from right

45:51.060 --> 45:52.060
wing media.

45:52.060 --> 45:56.820
And he's really, he has the right thought, but he's not reaching the conclusion.

45:56.820 --> 46:02.620
And that is how could Trump, if he is our hero, how could he know all of these things

46:02.620 --> 46:06.060
and allow it to continue?

46:06.060 --> 46:08.420
Take the next step, buddy.

46:08.420 --> 46:15.540
I would imagine that the next step is making up a reason that makes him still be the hero.

46:15.540 --> 46:22.140
Or just turning it into like, uh, Trump was set up himself or yeah, who knows what Alex

46:22.140 --> 46:23.140
is doing?

46:23.140 --> 46:24.140
He's surrounded.

46:24.140 --> 46:25.140
He can't do anything.

46:25.140 --> 46:26.340
No, he was chosen by God.

46:26.340 --> 46:27.340
He was defeated.

46:27.340 --> 46:30.940
So was God, but that's not his fault or God's fault somehow.

46:30.940 --> 46:32.900
Really no one's no, it's no one's probably the devil.

46:32.900 --> 46:33.900
It's probably the devil.

46:33.900 --> 46:39.500
So another caller calls in and Alex gives him some bad advice that if people are listening

46:39.500 --> 46:44.020
to a show and taking him seriously, Alex could like be costing people thousands and thousands

46:44.020 --> 46:46.220
and thousands of dollars.

46:46.220 --> 46:51.060
Coming from a blue state, you know, in a populated area, we got a thousand people per square

46:51.060 --> 46:52.060
mile.

46:52.060 --> 46:53.060
Easy.

46:53.060 --> 46:56.100
Here is the time to go here.

46:56.100 --> 47:02.620
You know, we, we continue to quest for those who 100% is, is, is, you know, downsize your

47:02.620 --> 47:05.760
life and have, and have cultural goodness with God.

47:05.760 --> 47:07.540
It's worth everything not to be part of the system.

47:07.540 --> 47:09.860
You must flee blue States and blue cities.

47:09.860 --> 47:13.340
They're designed to totally collapse and bring down the entire United States.

47:13.340 --> 47:14.340
God bless your brother.

47:14.340 --> 47:19.660
So I guess, um, this caller, he does mention that he is like, his family has some land

47:19.660 --> 47:20.660
he can go to.

47:20.660 --> 47:21.660
Sure.

47:21.660 --> 47:26.060
But like if you're someone who's listening, uprooting your life, it would be very, very

47:26.060 --> 47:27.060
expensive.

47:27.060 --> 47:28.060
Sure.

47:28.060 --> 47:30.460
Um, and Alex is good thing that his family has land though.

47:30.460 --> 47:35.580
Well, that makes it less, this caller does, but not other people who are listening probably

47:35.580 --> 47:38.560
if they believe what Alex is saying, they're like, they're coming to kill you.

47:38.560 --> 47:39.900
They want to chop you up.

47:39.900 --> 47:45.140
Uh, you know, America's over, it's time to flee the blue cities cause they're death traps

47:45.140 --> 47:46.740
and they're meant to collapse.

47:46.740 --> 47:52.740
Like he could fuck around and ruin people's lives in a way that you'd never hear about.

47:52.740 --> 47:57.000
You'd never hear about these people who would listen to Alex, took him seriously and decided

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
to go to Idaho.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.380
And I'm sorry to the people of Idaho that that's the example I often come up with.

48:02.380 --> 48:03.380
Sure.

48:03.380 --> 48:04.380
It could be Montana.

48:04.380 --> 48:05.380
Idaho is a great state.

48:05.380 --> 48:07.660
Idaho, could be Oregon, could be any of those.

48:07.660 --> 48:12.020
I mean, but a penny that they're spending on moving to a remote location is a penny

48:12.020 --> 48:13.580
they're not giving to Alex.

48:13.580 --> 48:14.580
That's true.

48:14.580 --> 48:18.980
So except if they need, I think Alex is the one who's the real loser in this scenario.

48:18.980 --> 48:21.260
Not if they need to stock up with survival food.

48:21.260 --> 48:22.460
Ooh, that's fair.

48:22.460 --> 48:23.460
Yeah.

48:23.460 --> 48:24.460
He's got that one.

48:24.460 --> 48:25.460
He's got them coming and going.

48:25.460 --> 48:26.460
He does.

48:26.460 --> 48:27.460
Literally.

48:27.460 --> 48:28.460
Literally.

48:28.460 --> 48:31.220
And he has those water filters that are the size of a school bus and the only, he's the

48:31.220 --> 48:33.540
new Amazon for people who flee.

48:33.540 --> 48:34.540
Yeah.

48:34.540 --> 48:38.300
So Alex now has a guest on, it's Jason Jones.

48:38.300 --> 48:44.060
He's a guy who didn't like COVID restrictions and came to Alex's attention through a YouTube

48:44.060 --> 48:45.900
video, I think.

48:45.900 --> 48:52.700
Anyway, he is there because he was at the Capitol on the 6th and he's complaining about

48:52.700 --> 48:57.100
how the media's gaslighting people about what happened.

48:57.100 --> 48:58.340
This is so funny.

48:58.340 --> 48:59.340
Mic down for this.

48:59.340 --> 49:00.340
Okay.

49:00.340 --> 49:01.340
Because this made me laugh so hard.

49:01.340 --> 49:03.520
You know, it's one thing to tell a lie.

49:03.520 --> 49:07.220
It's another to seem like you believe your own lies.

49:07.220 --> 49:13.260
It was all, it was all quite horrifying, Alex, and it just convinced me that we have to double

49:13.260 --> 49:21.700
down on our commitment to freedom of speech, freedom of religion, free and fair elections.

49:21.700 --> 49:24.380
And you know, we're not, we're not going anywhere.

49:24.380 --> 49:26.500
We're going to keep standing up.

49:26.500 --> 49:32.100
Oh, I thought Alex was still here.

49:32.100 --> 49:44.900
I thought, okay, so yeah, I, uh, that, that's what I got.

49:44.900 --> 49:45.900
Out to break.

49:45.900 --> 49:48.900
That's, that's good stuff, man.

49:48.900 --> 49:51.180
I thought eating a sandwich was rude.

49:51.180 --> 49:52.180
Alex just left.

49:52.180 --> 49:53.420
I love it.

49:53.420 --> 49:54.420
That's beautiful.

49:54.420 --> 49:55.700
That is beautiful.

49:55.700 --> 50:02.060
Ah, I don't understand how Trump could just leave, you know, knowing everything he knows.

50:02.060 --> 50:04.020
I don't understand how Trump could just leave.

50:04.020 --> 50:06.500
Alex, I don't know how he could just leave.

50:06.500 --> 50:07.500
It's remarkable.

50:07.500 --> 50:12.460
I mean, Jason was saying like Alex, he was addressing Alex and Alex wasn't there.

50:12.460 --> 50:13.540
That's fantastic.

50:13.540 --> 50:18.360
He later says that he was walking around with a headset mic so he could hear everything

50:18.360 --> 50:19.860
that Jason Jones was saying.

50:19.860 --> 50:20.860
Sure.

50:20.860 --> 50:23.140
Uh, there's man, that is, that is profoundly rude.

50:23.140 --> 50:24.140
That is fantastic.

50:24.140 --> 50:25.140
Yeah.

50:25.140 --> 50:26.140
Yeah.

50:26.140 --> 50:27.140
Love it.

50:27.140 --> 50:28.580
Doesn't matter how much of a dick Alex is.

50:28.580 --> 50:29.580
Doesn't matter.

50:29.580 --> 50:30.580
He has a platform.

50:30.580 --> 50:31.580
Just keep on coming.

50:31.580 --> 50:32.580
Okay.

50:32.580 --> 50:38.220
Um, somebody who used Alex's platform, uh, maybe for nefarious purposes, Steve Pachannik

50:38.220 --> 50:42.060
and uh, Steve might have turned evil according to Alex in this.

50:42.060 --> 50:43.060
Okay.

50:43.060 --> 50:47.060
And he seems to be implying that Steve flipped over and started supporting Q cause he turned

50:47.060 --> 50:48.060
evil.

50:48.060 --> 50:49.060
Okay.

50:49.060 --> 50:52.220
But that introduces a problem and that is that Alex is huge on General Flynn now.

50:52.220 --> 50:53.220
Right.

50:53.220 --> 50:54.540
General Flynn pledged allegiance to Q.

50:54.540 --> 50:55.540
There's that.

50:55.540 --> 50:59.980
So Alex tries to thread this needle here and it does not work.

50:59.980 --> 51:04.120
The movement was exploding, Q came along to take control of it with intelligence ops.

51:04.120 --> 51:07.340
We now know that well-known intelligence ops that I know personally flipped to Q at the

51:07.340 --> 51:08.860
end because they were controlled.

51:08.860 --> 51:10.740
Um, General Flynn's a great guy.

51:10.740 --> 51:14.140
He just wanted to lead an army that was waiting there with Q, but he still didn't control

51:14.140 --> 51:15.140
it.

51:15.140 --> 51:16.140
He's a good guy.

51:16.140 --> 51:17.140
Oh, so he's a good guy.

51:17.140 --> 51:19.780
He's, he just wanted to control an army.

51:19.780 --> 51:22.140
I don't know.

51:22.140 --> 51:23.140
I don't know.

51:23.140 --> 51:28.220
I feel like controlling an army under false pretenses makes you less of a good guy.

51:28.220 --> 51:29.220
Right?

51:29.220 --> 51:30.220
Oh, okay.

51:30.220 --> 51:31.220
Good guy.

51:31.220 --> 51:32.220
He's a good dude.

51:32.220 --> 51:35.620
He's just, uh, you know, lying to all these evil people in order to turn them into an

51:35.620 --> 51:39.060
army that he can use to overthrow the government, Dan.

51:39.060 --> 51:40.060
Yeah.

51:40.060 --> 51:41.060
That's a patriot.

51:41.060 --> 51:42.060
Mm-hmm.

51:42.060 --> 51:47.700
And see, the problem with QAnon, according to Jason Jones, is, uh, you know, they use

51:47.700 --> 51:51.980
vague information from anonymous sources.

51:51.980 --> 51:52.980
Mm-hmm.

51:52.980 --> 51:56.860
While you're listening to this, just remember how many times Alex has referenced vague things

51:56.860 --> 51:59.580
that a Lieutenant Colonel told him.

51:59.580 --> 52:02.100
People have such faith in Q.

52:02.100 --> 52:06.660
I've been startled at people in my life, people I love and know from, I went to high school

52:06.660 --> 52:08.220
with, college with, served in the army.

52:08.220 --> 52:12.660
They're just, I'm getting inundated with these texts and forwards that their source, they

52:12.660 --> 52:16.980
all have these sources and I'll call them and I'll say, listen, you know, put, put that

52:16.980 --> 52:17.980
aside for now.

52:17.980 --> 52:19.680
Please stop sharing this information.

52:19.680 --> 52:21.240
It's from an anonymous source.

52:21.240 --> 52:26.440
It's communicated in a, in a way that's ambiguous and you can't verify what they state.

52:26.440 --> 52:32.140
When you have, uh, um, an ambiguous statement from an anonymous source that cannot be verified,

52:32.140 --> 52:34.620
you can't support it or refute it.

52:34.620 --> 52:38.700
All that can lead to is infighting and mistrust.

52:38.700 --> 52:41.900
And then that's the structure, the very structure.

52:41.900 --> 52:43.860
It doesn't matter even the content of what they say.

52:43.860 --> 52:48.940
It doesn't matter what you say when it's from an anonymous source, said in an ambiguous

52:48.940 --> 52:53.220
way that cannot be verified or refuted.

52:53.220 --> 52:55.780
The only thing you have that is argument.

52:55.780 --> 52:58.020
It is a satanic action.

52:58.020 --> 52:59.020
What?

52:59.020 --> 53:00.020
What?

53:00.020 --> 53:06.300
I mean, Jason might as well be explaining what Alex does and Alex turns in it's a satanic

53:06.300 --> 53:07.300
system.

53:07.300 --> 53:08.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:08.300 --> 53:09.300
It's very dumb.

53:09.300 --> 53:15.440
I do like whenever a self-awareness of one's evil is allowed to sublimate through blaming

53:15.440 --> 53:16.440
someone else.

53:16.440 --> 53:17.440
That's good.

53:17.440 --> 53:18.440
That's good stuff.

53:18.440 --> 53:20.400
Way to not reflect.

53:20.400 --> 53:25.740
So earlier on this episode we heard Alex pretty bad, you know, freaking out a little bit.

53:25.740 --> 53:26.740
They're going to kill you.

53:26.740 --> 53:27.740
They're going to chop you up.

53:27.740 --> 53:28.740
Sure.

53:28.740 --> 53:29.740
Shit's going down.

53:29.740 --> 53:30.740
Naturally.

53:30.740 --> 53:31.740
Poison in the water.

53:31.740 --> 53:32.740
Uh-huh.

53:32.740 --> 53:33.740
They're going to kill you.

53:33.740 --> 53:34.740
Naturally.

53:34.740 --> 53:37.260
He was also very viscerally responding to things.

53:37.260 --> 53:38.260
He seemed pretty mad.

53:38.260 --> 53:41.220
And that's why this is really, really funny.

53:41.220 --> 53:47.460
You have been probably, you should write a book on maintaining inner peace.

53:47.460 --> 53:48.940
I agree.

53:48.940 --> 53:49.940
I very much agree.

53:49.940 --> 53:51.060
Breathe through the nose.

53:51.060 --> 54:00.820
I very much agree that I have often been lacking a zen and the art of screaming propaganda.

54:00.820 --> 54:04.460
This position's called the sun salutation.

54:04.460 --> 54:05.460
Do it every morning.

54:05.460 --> 54:06.460
Keeps me centered.

54:06.460 --> 54:08.460
Keeps me sane.

54:08.460 --> 54:12.500
And she's going to start some Adderall real quick and then I'm going to yoga.

54:12.500 --> 54:20.180
First Adderall, then incense, we burn incense to keep the vibe real chill in the house.

54:20.180 --> 54:22.980
I always have a glass of tea.

54:22.980 --> 54:28.900
You know what's fun about yoga is whenever your right leg is constantly shaking.

54:28.900 --> 54:29.900
Makes it more difficult.

54:29.900 --> 54:30.900
Yeah, it does stuff.

54:30.900 --> 54:33.740
So anyway, their interview's stupid, don't care.

54:33.740 --> 54:35.660
And that brings us to the 19th.

54:35.660 --> 54:42.500
So now we're on to Tuesday, the day before Communist Joe Biden becomes president.

54:42.500 --> 54:48.040
And since we're recording this on the 21st, we know that it went off without a hitch.

54:48.040 --> 54:51.700
No real trouble at the inauguration.

54:51.700 --> 54:57.740
I'd say 25,000 uniformed troops probably is a pretty good deterrent.

54:57.740 --> 54:59.060
Probably.

54:59.060 --> 55:05.260
He gave his speech and it sort of flew in the face of he's senile, he can't talk for

55:05.260 --> 55:06.900
even a minute kind of stuff.

55:06.900 --> 55:09.560
There was an issue.

55:09.560 --> 55:13.660
So Alex is still living in the before times though.

55:13.660 --> 55:18.460
But he does know that that is what's going to happen, that Biden is going to get in.

55:18.460 --> 55:19.460
Sure.

55:19.460 --> 55:23.900
Unfortunately, almost half of his audience believes Steve.

55:23.900 --> 55:28.540
And I have a lot of people mad at me, but you won't be mad tomorrow when you see that

55:28.540 --> 55:29.540
I told you the truth.

55:29.540 --> 55:30.540
You'll be very, very sad.

55:30.540 --> 55:35.860
We had a poll on infowars.com over the weekend with tens of thousands of people that clicked

55:35.860 --> 55:36.860
on it.

55:36.860 --> 55:40.100
I don't know if we ever had a chance to pull that up, show an article about it where we

55:40.100 --> 55:42.360
can repost it and have people vote again.

55:42.360 --> 55:49.180
And over 45% thought that everyone's being mass arrested and Trump's gonna stay in office.

55:49.180 --> 55:50.180
Absolutely incredible.

55:50.180 --> 55:52.540
Well, maybe part of that is because of the people you talk to.

55:52.540 --> 55:53.540
I don't understand.

55:53.540 --> 55:54.540
Maybe it's because of-

55:54.540 --> 56:00.460
It is absolutely incredible that my audience, after me telling them this, would believe

56:00.460 --> 56:01.460
it.

56:01.460 --> 56:03.860
And me having guests on who I've overinflated their credibility.

56:03.860 --> 56:04.860
Totally.

56:04.860 --> 56:07.540
Saying that they know everything, they overthrow countries.

56:07.540 --> 56:11.180
I mean, you've had somebody who's literally toppled governments before.

56:11.180 --> 56:15.220
I don't understand why we would believe he couldn't once more.

56:15.220 --> 56:16.220
Exactly.

56:16.220 --> 56:17.220
Yeah.

56:17.220 --> 56:21.860
I think that that's indicative of... I mean, I don't know how scientific these polls are

56:21.860 --> 56:28.300
on Infowars, but assuming that a third of his audience even, let's say, believes that

56:28.300 --> 56:34.360
Steve is right and that Trump is gonna somehow magically remain president, if I saw that

56:34.360 --> 56:38.140
number for our audience, I would think I'd failed.

56:38.140 --> 56:39.140
Yeah, I would strongly believe that.

56:39.140 --> 56:41.860
I think that's a big problem with my audience.

56:41.860 --> 56:42.860
Yeah.

56:42.860 --> 56:46.340
I would almost say that would be a reason for us to quit doing the show.

56:46.340 --> 56:47.340
Yeah.

56:47.340 --> 56:48.340
Yeah.

56:48.340 --> 56:49.340
We're bad for people.

56:49.340 --> 56:50.340
Alex doesn't look at it that way.

56:50.340 --> 56:55.740
He's kind of excited for them to be proven wrong and to be proven right.

56:55.740 --> 56:56.740
Just a little shitty.

56:56.740 --> 56:58.900
That'll show the people who give me money.

56:58.900 --> 56:59.900
Yeah.

56:59.900 --> 57:07.540
So there's a loose thread dangling from the sixth, and that is that Alex has said repeatedly,

57:07.540 --> 57:13.600
and on microphones, that Trump personally asked him to lead the march from the speech

57:13.600 --> 57:15.240
to the Capitol building.

57:15.240 --> 57:16.300
Doesn't look good in hindsight.

57:16.300 --> 57:17.620
Does not.

57:17.620 --> 57:20.380
Turns out Alex was set up from the inside.

57:20.380 --> 57:21.380
Okay.

57:21.380 --> 57:22.380
Okay.

57:22.380 --> 57:26.300
He wanted a million people in DC to peacefully demonstrate so that we would show we had more

57:26.300 --> 57:29.900
numbers than they did and to show that Biden couldn't fill a parking lot and Trump could

57:29.900 --> 57:34.020
get a million people there, that Trump was coming to speak at a stage that was set up

57:34.020 --> 57:36.020
on the other side.

57:36.020 --> 57:39.340
But it was all a setup.

57:39.340 --> 57:40.700
That stage was there the night before.

57:40.700 --> 57:42.540
It was broken down by the time we got there.

57:42.540 --> 57:44.540
Oh, we were totally set up.

57:44.540 --> 57:48.220
We walked completely into a trap with people inside his administration we know now that

57:48.220 --> 57:55.020
set Trump up and told him, uh, that, uh, you know, it's Jones's idea to march the Capitol

57:55.020 --> 57:56.020
and all this stuff.

57:56.020 --> 57:57.020
And it's a great idea.

57:57.020 --> 58:00.060
You should tell him to lead it because they intended for me to go in there and lead that

58:00.060 --> 58:02.420
thing so they could throw my ass in prison.

58:02.420 --> 58:05.520
But of course, by the time I got there, I saw what was happening and tried to stop it.

58:05.520 --> 58:13.460
This is the real world, people who inside the Trump administration was trying to set

58:13.460 --> 58:14.460
you up.

58:14.460 --> 58:15.460
Name names.

58:15.460 --> 58:18.340
If somebody was trying to set you up, I would imagine you would really want to name names.

58:18.340 --> 58:19.660
That'd be big news.

58:19.660 --> 58:20.660
Yeah.

58:20.660 --> 58:23.420
I think everybody would give you a lot of attention if you could name names.

58:23.420 --> 58:24.420
Yeah.

58:24.420 --> 58:25.420
Come on, Alex.

58:25.420 --> 58:27.440
Jesus does not doesn't.

58:27.440 --> 58:33.500
So the globalist plan, um, Oh, also, by the way, I realize now that we've moved on to

58:33.500 --> 58:34.500
the 19th.

58:34.500 --> 58:39.180
He didn't really do a last episode on the 18th, but he also didn't say I'm doing it

58:39.180 --> 58:40.180
tomorrow.

58:40.180 --> 58:42.380
So I assume that was meant to be it.

58:42.380 --> 58:44.740
And it was just that outburst and he just got distracted.

58:44.740 --> 58:49.180
I think he just did an outburst and started yelling and hoped it would be kind of look

58:49.180 --> 58:50.180
like network.

58:50.180 --> 58:51.180
Sure.

58:51.180 --> 58:52.660
That's kind of the feeling that I get.

58:52.660 --> 58:57.540
I think, I think his last broadcast being like 15 minutes long would really be great

58:57.540 --> 58:58.540
for me.

58:58.540 --> 59:06.500
His last broadcast being talking about migrant caravans over, over exaggerating their fear

59:06.500 --> 59:09.180
that you should have for them.

59:09.180 --> 59:12.660
And then that putting him into a mood where he screams about shit and how you're all going

59:12.660 --> 59:13.660
to die.

59:13.660 --> 59:14.660
Right.

59:14.660 --> 59:15.980
And this is over man.

59:15.980 --> 59:17.520
And then puts off going to calls.

59:17.520 --> 59:18.520
I think that's fitting.

59:18.520 --> 59:19.520
I think that's pretty good.

59:19.520 --> 59:20.820
I mean, that's about right.

59:20.820 --> 59:24.820
It's either that or him just being like, and now I'm going to say all the slurs that I've

59:24.820 --> 59:28.620
wanted to since the beginning in alphabetical order.

59:28.620 --> 59:29.620
Hey.

59:29.620 --> 59:30.620
Yeah.

59:30.620 --> 59:32.780
Also, here's what I think about Willy Wonka.

59:32.780 --> 59:33.780
Yes.

59:33.780 --> 59:34.780
Yeah.

59:34.780 --> 59:35.780
Yeah.

59:35.780 --> 59:38.220
I watched it last night and I've got a 20 minute review.

59:38.220 --> 59:41.260
Horrific, horrific racism plus sci-fi reviews.

59:41.260 --> 59:42.260
Yeah.

59:42.260 --> 59:50.020
Um, speaking of sci-fi, did you know that, um, H.G. Wells, formerly was the head of the

59:50.020 --> 59:51.020
bad guys?

59:51.020 --> 59:52.300
I did not know that.

59:52.300 --> 59:53.300
I learned that.

59:53.300 --> 59:54.300
Okay.

59:54.300 --> 59:58.580
And they were planning this takeover for a hundred years, really longer.

59:58.580 --> 59:59.580
You can debate.

59:59.580 --> 01:00:05.540
I mean, 1850s, they had the basic plan under Galton Wedgwood and Huxley.

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.540
Sure.

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:10.940
Those are the grandparents of like Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:18.260
And then by 1900, H.G. Wells was the leader of the Illuminati and they had more of the

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:22.740
modern plan all dialed up and ready, but it was all extremely visionary.

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:23.740
Just ultra visionary.

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:27.300
They're always 30, 40 years ahead of everybody, which is why they say they have the right

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:28.300
to do this.

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.300
And I understand their perspective.

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:33.060
I mean, I'm not going to join them because I can feel my immortal soul is in danger.

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:34.060
I can feel it.

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.700
Uh, but I understand why they're doing it.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.700
It makes a lot of sense.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:37.700
I mean, the public's so dumb.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.860
They can openly take everything away from you and kill you.

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:40.860
You put up with it.

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:41.860
You deserve to die.

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:42.860
Wow.

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:43.860
Alex.

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:44.860
Strong words.

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:45.860
Yeah.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:46.860
Strong words immediately following.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:50.100
I think that the Dead Authors podcast by Paul F. Tompkins is real.

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:53.140
You shouldn't, uh, probably have that position.

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:56.700
It seems, it seems, uh, bad.

01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:01.120
I think it goes against everything that he said he wanted in the past for saving people

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.120
in the light.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.120
It does feel that way.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.120
Yeah.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:08.300
Also, if like, uh, the H.G. Wells was the leader of the Illuminati, but this plan only

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:13.060
goes back to the Wedgewoods in 1850, the Illuminati started in 1776.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.060
Sure.

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:15.060
Right?

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:16.060
I mean.

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.060
Something along those lines.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.940
Doesn't that go back before 1850?

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:19.940
Who knows?

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:20.940
This is stupid.

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:21.940
They were the new Illuminati.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:27.420
Like the old Illuminati died, Coke brought it back in new Illuminati, I believe.

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.420
That sounds right.

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:32.380
Anyway, H.G. Wells, not just an author.

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.380
No.

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.380
Head of the Illuminati.

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.380
Not just a...

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:36.380
Cool.

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.380
Yeah.

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:38.380
Cool.

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:42.020
Um, Alex doesn't have a meeting with him, but he might have a meeting with another top

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.020
Illuminati figure.

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.020
Okay.

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:47.220
The difference is I'm not going to join him, though I am going to be meeting with a top

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:48.740
globalist the next month.

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:49.740
Top globalist.

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:53.660
So I will be entertaining, at least what they have to say, because it's important to keep

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.660
those dialogues going.

01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:57.240
What?

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.240
What did you just say?

01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.240
This is very serious, ladies and gentlemen.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:03.300
This is your life, your soul, your children's future, and you just have to understand that

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.380
I'm not going to sit here and debate and argue with people about this stuff.

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:07.700
It's all out in the open.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:10.940
So yeah, Alex is going to have a meeting with the top globalists.

01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:12.340
So it's got to be what?

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:13.340
Bill Gates?

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:14.340
It has to be something like that.

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:16.340
Although he's a middle man now.

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:17.340
Maybe.

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:18.340
Maybe.

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:19.340
It's possible.

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:20.340
It's possible.

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.340
That's Alex's guess to ask.

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.340
Yeah.

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.340
Could be Klaus Schwab?

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.340
It could be.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.340
Could be.

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:26.340
Could be.

01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.820
I want to say it's a secret Rothschild.

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:29.940
I think it's one of the ones that we've never heard of.

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:31.220
A mystery Rothschild?

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:32.420
Yeah, that's why they get away with it.

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:34.460
Like that one Jonas brother who's not in the group?

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:35.460
There's another Jonas brother?

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.460
There's a bonus Jonas.

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:37.460
There's a secret Jonas?

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.460
Yeah.

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:39.460
Who was it?

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:46.220
Was it the Kennedys who supposedly had a relative that they kept in the attic or something like

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:47.220
that?

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.220
I think they did.

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:49.220
Oh, that's right.

01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:50.220
Yeah.

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:51.220
Holy shit.

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.220
That's real weird that we're just...

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:53.220
Oh, that's crazy.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.220
Yeah.

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:56.620
I was just talking about a Jonas brother who didn't get to be in the fucking group.

01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:58.620
You're talking about something really sad.

01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.260
I thought it was a myth at first.

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.260
No.

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.500
I don't know who Alex is talking about.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:04.900
I also don't believe this is true.

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:11.680
But the globalists, they need you to accept their plan in order for them to get away with

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.680
what they're doing.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:13.680
Sure.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.680
Alex expresses this a little bit.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:17.420
And then I wanted to talk a tiny bit about where this idea comes from.

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:21.900
Humanity is starting to wake up and actually be who they should be and say no to it.

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:26.460
And then the globalists don't get to play the social Darwin game.

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:30.380
But if you don't recognize what they're doing, if you don't have an open dialogue with the

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:34.100
globalist and talk to them person to person and say, I know what you're doing.

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:35.100
You don't have a right.

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:36.380
I'm going to resist you.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:39.740
Then they have no respect for you and will run over you.

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:44.180
They metaphysically need you to acquiesce and submit.

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.380
They always have to leave you an escape valve.

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:50.540
That is a rule of the universe that God has put down and they follow these rules.

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:51.540
He got his ass kicked by Satan.

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:55.260
And if you won't study what they're up to and if you won't study their plan versus God's

01:03:55.260 --> 01:04:03.060
plan, and if you won't make a spiritual, cultural, economic and physical decision who you're

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:06.780
with, then you are fair game to them.

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:12.880
So the religious stuff that he adds on to this is whatever, but like the idea that if

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:18.580
you don't know their plan and specifically fight back, like he's just taking that from

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:24.260
that fake document, Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars, which was chapter one of Bill Cooper's

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.740
book Behold the Pale Horse.

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:32.220
We covered this in depth in our episode number 381 on this podcast, so I don't want to rehash

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:33.580
all the history of that again.

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:37.100
But if you're interested in how fake that document is, go and listen to that.

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:41.040
On page six of that fake document, there's a particular quote that Bill Cooper would

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:44.100
repeat over and over and over again on his show.

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:47.820
So to the point where like if you were a listener, you would definitely have that implanted in

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:50.460
your mind as a really important point.

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.420
Quote, all science is merely a means to an end.

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.620
The means is knowledge.

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:55.980
The end is control.

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:58.000
Beyond this remains only one issue.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.900
Who will be the beneficiary?

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:03.280
In 1954, this was the issue of primary concern.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:07.700
Although the so-called moral issues were raised, in view of the law of natural selection, it

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:12.100
was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence are no

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:15.060
better than animals who do not have intelligence.

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:20.140
Such people are beasts of burden and stakes on the table by choice and consent.

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:23.860
This is where Alex's idea that if you don't directly fight the globalists, that's the

01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:28.980
equivalent of you consenting for them to do whatever you want, they want to do to you.

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:33.860
That if you're, if they can get away with taking all your stuff, you know, that's, this

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:35.780
is all just silent weapons for quiet wars.

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:40.620
I've heard Alex reference the document before, I know he was a huge Bill Cooper listener,

01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:45.580
like that's all, that's all this like mythology about the globalists needing you to consent

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:48.180
by not fighting them stuff comes from.

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:49.820
It's all just a fake document.

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:55.940
I assume he's apologized for saying that he knows God's plan and he can see it and he's

01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:01.260
part of God's plan and that he's, and he's apologized for being wrong and he said that

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:07.260
he can't see God's plan and maybe, you know, all of his ideas of what God can control are

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.260
off.

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.260
No, not once.

01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.260
Not once?

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.260
This is all still part of God's plan.

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:16.620
God's plan is now for him to fight Joe Biden politically and make a bunch of money telling

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:17.660
people to head to the woods.

01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:22.300
See now, I thought he had already told me that God's plan was for him to defeat Joe

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:27.620
Biden and the devil and Trump to take over and create a lasting 1,000 year long reign.

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:31.260
I don't know if he was ever specific about the 1,000 year reign, but it did certainly

01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:33.060
have overtones of that.

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:34.300
Yeah, I don't know.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:35.300
I don't know.

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:41.380
One of the things about prophets is when they're alive, they're really slippery.

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:45.980
They change their prophecies quite a bit.

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:48.100
Joseph Smith was real good at that.

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:50.380
He had a real talent for that.

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:53.180
Kind of, it's where long form improv comes from.

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.500
It might be.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:59.220
Super long form improv is rearranging prophecies.

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:01.300
Decades long form improv.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:06.220
So these games that Alex is playing with his predictions and stuff, maybe decades long,

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:10.220
but the globalists, their plan is hundreds of years old.

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:12.460
You can debate it.

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:14.420
Maybe it's 1850.

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:16.500
Maybe it's H.G. Wells.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.580
Maybe it's Mesopotamia.

01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:20.580
Maybe it's the pyramids.

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:21.580
That doesn't sound right.

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:22.580
Okay, well that sounds closer.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:26.820
But anyway, Alex is going to take a meeting with them because he thinks, in his hubris

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:32.220
filled mind, somehow he thinks he's going to talk the globalists out of their plans.

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:36.620
I don't take enjoyment seeing how screwed up and falling apart humanity is.

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:42.180
But the plan is to make humanity so dysfunctional that those of us that aren't part of it are

01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:46.920
going to basically have to either commit suicide or join with the globalists and wipe your

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.500
asses out.

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:53.380
Because if you won't stand up for yourself, then I can't help you.

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:58.660
And I'm not going to join the globalists, and I've openly had dialogues with some of

01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:03.140
their next to top level people, and I've had some dialogue with their top people, and they

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:04.980
want me to stop.

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:07.700
And they are not going to be able to convince me, I'm going to try to convince them.

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.140
Yeah, that's going to work.

01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:13.480
I don't believe any of this stuff, but let's humor him for a second and imagine that he's

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:18.320
going to go into, I don't know, a meeting with Klaus Schwab and be like, you gotta cut

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.320
it out, man.

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:22.400
And they're going to be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I have not heard this information

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.400
before.

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:24.540
Are you serious?

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:25.700
This is bad for humanity?

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:28.100
Oh no, I'm talking to the devil?

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:29.100
Fuck!

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:35.620
You know, his horns and the fact that I could never see him through the shadowy fire, that

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:37.300
I agree might have been a sign.

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:39.420
Fuck, I should have figured this out.

01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:43.780
Can't believe it took a weird Texan guy yelling at me to help me see the light.

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:44.860
Hold on one second.

01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:47.060
Hold on, Alex, just real quick.

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:53.540
Are you telling me that when I sold my soul to the literal devil, he was lying to me?

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:56.580
Alex has also said that these people act compulsively and they can't help themselves.

01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:00.980
So I don't know how he's going to talk anybody out of anything.

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:03.580
They're also not human anymore, according to Alex.

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:05.540
I don't know what having a parlay is going to do.

01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:07.180
It's all such stupid shit.

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:15.020
Well, I guess in order for him to enact his plans, he also has to get their tacit consent.

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.660
Because it's a rule of the universe.

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:17.820
It's God's plan.

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:21.220
No, because he's not doing anything to them.

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:24.420
They only play it's to.

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:28.540
The globalists only need your consent because the things that they're doing affect you,

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:30.860
like chemtrails over the country club.

01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:31.860
Sure.

01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:32.860
Sure.

01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:36.100
That affects all of us because of our passivity and not fighting them on it.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:38.740
That's consent to have chemtrails dropped on us.

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:41.940
Well, I mean, if you're going to defeat the globalists, I assume they're going to lose

01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.540
all of their money and power.

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:45.580
So that's doing something to them.

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:48.940
Yeah, but.

01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:53.540
I'm just saying, if it's a universal law, he actually has to get the consent of the

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:55.740
globalists before he can defeat them.

01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:56.740
Fine.

01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:59.220
Then I guess sports can't exist.

01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.220
Not in God's plan.

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:04.320
Because then every team has to consent to be beaten.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.620
You have to sign a waiver before you play the game.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:07.620
Oh, God.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.400
You both consent to.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:15.460
So Alex has a guest on this episode here on the 19th, and it's not an interview I'm

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.340
really interested in all that much.

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:24.100
It is the brother of John Sullivan, the guy who got arrested for videotaping inside the

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:25.460
Capitol building.

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:30.820
And Alex has decided he's the big Antifa leader who caused all the trouble.

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:35.460
We've got Mike Flynn the third, because Mike Flynn and Mike Jr. are not answering my calls

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:36.460
anymore.

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:42.980
So James Sullivan is a guy who has some right wing tendencies and is the brother of John.

01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:45.100
I just, I heard this, I was just like, ah.

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.100
So James, wow.

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:47.100
Incredible.

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:50.540
Tell us about yourself, about your brother and why you're on air with us and what you've

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:51.540
witnessed.

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.220
Because you're very well known in Utah.

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.340
You've been in news for a while countering your brother.

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:57.620
I mean, you're not just popping up now after this.

01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.820
You've been warning folks for a while.

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:02.420
This must be really hard for you to do.

01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:04.620
Yeah, yeah, it was.

01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:07.300
This interview is deeply irresponsible.

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:11.140
A lot of it ends up just being James talking about John's personal life in ways that I

01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:13.620
don't feel like they belong on Info Wars.

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:16.700
And a lot of it kind of left me feeling gross and uncomfortable.

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:20.760
I know that Alex really needs to build up John Sullivan as the big Antifa boogeyman

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.900
in order to carry his conspiracy theories about the storming of the Capitol being a

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:27.700
false flag, but this feels super inappropriate.

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:31.460
The whole thing is Alex trying to get James to give some details that Alex can use to

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.060
build a deeper narrative.

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:37.580
He's asking these probing questions about like, did someone put him on drugs or do you

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:40.300
know who his handler might be?

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:41.900
It's really gross.

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:48.940
And also, I don't know if James, however much he might disagree with his brother, I don't

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:54.500
know what kind of potential damage he realizes could come to him by virtue of the way this

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.200
conversation goes.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.380
If I fumbled in the Super Super Bowl in the one yard line, not understanding I was being

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:05.300
set up in all this, and I did, I don't take blame for it because I'm in the arena and

01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:09.140
we were fighting for election integrity and calling for legal and lawful things to happen.

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:13.320
I'm now being accused of trying to foment things, but he didn't fumble at the one yard

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.320
line.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.620
He scored and won the game against America in the Super Super Bowl of our Republic.

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:23.380
I mean, if they put a tombstone saying our Republic died in the future, if we don't come

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:27.340
back from this, it will be your brother and people like him that day that helped kill

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:28.340
the country.

01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:29.340
Yeah.

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:32.540
Oh, that's not good.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:37.780
I don't know if he realizes like the kind of conversation that they're having here is

01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:43.540
like, it's really the kind of thing that could potentially put a target on.

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:47.220
Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Sullivan, real quick, do you want our listeners to kill your brother?

01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:51.580
I just want you to, I just want you to agree with me that all of this is your brother's

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:52.580
fault.

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:59.900
He has killed the country and he of course deserves, I'm not going to, politically.

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:00.900
Right.

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:01.900
Yeah.

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:05.840
And at the same time too, this dude is saying that there was somebody who was along filming

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:11.120
John because they're making a documentary about him and his brother.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.700
Like the two of them are both like on opposite sides of the political aisle.

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:15.700
Sure.

01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:16.700
And so I'm like, I don't know what's going on here.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:17.700
I don't trust any of this.

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:19.460
I don't care about any of this.

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:20.460
Yeah.

01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:21.460
I, yeah, I really don't care.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:29.620
It's just really, really, really uncomfortable, but I will say that James doesn't realize

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:34.420
what Alex's narrative is clearly because he counters it.

01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:37.020
Seeing him wasn't really that much of a surprise.

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:43.540
After he was removed from Utah, he traveled to Kenosha, to California, to Portland, trying

01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:46.140
to get into these Antifa communities and they would kick him out.

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:49.500
So seeing him here wasn't really that big of a surprise.

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:50.500
Huh.

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:55.220
Well, his brother's saying that he keeps getting kicked out of Antifa groups, anti-fascist

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:56.220
groups.

01:13:56.220 --> 01:14:00.540
So it's kind of tough for Alex to then argue that he is an Antifa leader.

01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.540
Yeah.

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:03.040
I don't know.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.420
Seems like they're both running a game.

01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:11.000
That's what I, I'm not saying that they're running a game, but it does seem like they're

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.040
running a game.

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.980
I think that a lot of, there have been some people who have reached out with like their

01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:23.360
comments about Jon and from the sense that I get, there is sort of an attention seeking

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:32.120
behavior pattern and kind of disregard for what other people are doing that are productive

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:33.120
things.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:40.060
Maybe, maybe I'm just so conditioned to believe anybody in that sphere is running a game of

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:41.060
some kind.

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:46.100
Well, the thing that I think is the most worrying is the idea that someone was making a documentary

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:47.780
about the two of them.

01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:53.660
Like that to me is like, okay, if one of you, one of these brothers is someone who seems

01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:57.980
to have a clear pattern of attention seeking behavior and the other brothers happens to

01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:03.580
be directly on the other side of the political aisle and is doing a documentary with, it

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:05.540
seems like this is all attention seeking behavior.

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:06.540
It really does.

01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:10.440
And the fact that you would go and talk about your brother in such a weird way on Infowars

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.440
of all places.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.440
Yeah.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.660
It just, it grosses me out.

01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:20.220
There's too many human elements to it that just like, I wouldn't, I wouldn't like this,

01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:22.980
this kind of conversation to be had about anybody really.

01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:29.580
I don't see, I don't see any like either they're like the, okay, so they could be running a

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:34.860
game and this is fucked up or they're not running a game and this is fucked up.

01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:35.860
Yeah.

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:36.860
You know, like this is fucked up.

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:37.860
Yeah.

01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:38.860
Yeah.

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:42.300
We have not interviewed people who know Alex for a reason because it's uncomfortable and

01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:43.300
fucking weird.

01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:44.300
Totally.

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:46.100
I wish Alex would do the same because this is weird.

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:47.100
This is weird.

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:51.060
It's very, very unpleasant to listen to it and so we won't listen to any more of it.

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:55.480
Alex does though on this episode, get to sit talking about how he doesn't want Biden dead,

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.860
but he is going to put them in his death pool.

01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:57.860
Okay.

01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:58.860
That's not great.

01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:00.500
So I don't want anything bad to happen by they'll turn them into a martyr, but I do

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:05.300
put a death pool on him, a dead pool.

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:17.500
I don't think he's going to be dead in the next year, but I, I bet Biden, he likes power

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:21.340
though, but they put him in there cause he's so weak and so addled.

01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:23.820
He's talked about stepping down, fainting an illness as a reason to go.

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:24.820
When?

01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:25.820
I don't know.

01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:28.300
We should have a whole show in debate once we have our installed president, our first

01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:29.300
dictator.

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:30.300
So first dictator again.

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:31.300
Yeah.

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.100
He was talking about stepping down and faking an illness when he was vice president.

01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:35.100
Yeah.

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:37.060
If he had a fundamental difference with Obama.

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:38.060
Yeah.

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:41.540
Um, there's a very different situation than, uh, than the current, but whatever.

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:42.540
I don't know.

01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:47.060
I know that, you know, he's trying to say he's putting him in the death pool, but I

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:48.060
don't know what it'd be.

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:49.660
He's saying I put a death pool on him.

01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:50.660
Like it's a hex.

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:51.660
Yeah.

01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:52.660
He did say that.

01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:53.660
It's very weird.

01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:54.660
I put a death pool on you.

01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:55.660
Yeah.

01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:58.820
So we have another guest here before we wrap up the 19th.

01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:00.140
This episode was not good.

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:01.940
This was a slog to get through.

01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:08.340
Um, Alex has Nick Fuentes on and uh, it's interesting because they have slightly different

01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:10.660
viewpoints about the storming of the Capitol.

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:11.660
Unsurprising.

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.080
Alex is all false flag.

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.080
This was bad.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.080
Totally.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.740
Nick has been pretty in favor.

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:19.620
But they're calling it the great insurrection.

01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:21.180
They're calling it into the world.

01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:23.620
They're calling for Nick Fuentes to be arrested because he was seen outside.

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:25.480
They're calling for me to be arrested.

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.700
I think it was great to see people say, we know this was a fraudulent election, but I

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:33.980
think it was terrible that some people gave the system what they wanted when they broke

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:34.980
in.

01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:37.500
So Nick Fuentes has been quoted in the media as liking what happened.

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.620
I imagine that's probably out of context.

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:42.220
We appreciate him coming on to tell us what he really thinks.

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:46.580
So the founder of the groipers, a former Trump volunteer and popular talk show host, Nick

01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:47.580
Fuentes.

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:48.580
Nick.

01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:49.580
Thanks for coming on.

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:50.580
Thanks for having me.

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:55.540
I want to play one thing here that's sort of out of order because I think it, uh, it

01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.020
uh, is our rights context.

01:17:58.020 --> 01:17:59.020
It's our responsibility.

01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:00.020
Okay.

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:03.540
Later people falsely claimed that I breached the Capitol, which wasn't true.

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:05.780
Uh, but I stood outside the Capitol.

01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:09.160
I watched, I gave a little speech and then we packed up and left.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:13.900
There were people who were claiming that Nick Fuentes was, uh, along with like baked Alaska

01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:14.900
in the Capitol.

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:18.980
And there was a picture that definitely looked a ton like Nick Fuentes.

01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:19.980
Yeah.

01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:22.540
It was quite believable.

01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:28.980
And I, uh, took that as proof that he was there cause I looked a lot like him and uh,

01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:30.300
it appears that that's not accurate.

01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:31.300
Okay.

01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:32.640
It appears that he was outside.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:33.940
He did not go inside.

01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:39.060
He claims that is the case and I can't find solid evidence outside of that picture.

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:40.060
Yeah.

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:41.060
Yeah.

01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:47.220
And I'm willing to believe, uh, his, uh, his statement that I was wrong when I repeated

01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:49.060
that he was in, uh, in the Capitol.

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:50.060
So yeah, totally.

01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:54.020
Um, anyway, he still thinks it was great though.

01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:55.220
Yeah, of course.

01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:58.380
Which almost is more evidence I think that he didn't go inside.

01:18:58.380 --> 01:18:59.380
Yeah.

01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:04.260
I, I imagine if he were under arrest right now, he would think less of how great it was.

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:09.140
A lot of people who are getting arrested probably are not like, that was awesome.

01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:12.700
I'm a, I'm a big fan of the, Joe Biggs is not, uh, pumped right now.

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:13.700
I'm a big fan.

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.740
I'm a big fan of the, uh, we got carried up in the moment argument.

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:19.500
Hey man, it's a crime of passion, Dan.

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:21.020
Those don't count.

01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:24.860
Well, some people would look at it as a crime of passion and some people would think of

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:32.020
what happened that day, the entirety of it as the culmination of the stop the steal thing

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:33.300
that Alex was a big part of.

01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:34.300
You could say that.

01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:38.260
And when we got there, the entire Capitol building was surrounded.

01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:44.340
You know, I have to say it was a pretty awesome site because I had been, and I know that you

01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:45.620
were there as well.

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:49.940
We were traveling the country in Phoenix, Atlanta, all over the place doing stop the

01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:53.700
steal protest, raising awareness about the voter fraud and everything.

01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:58.700
And so to finally see hundreds of thousands of Trump supporters surrounding the U S Capitol

01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:03.860
building demanding that Mike Pence or the Republican senators take action on the voter

01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:04.860
fraud.

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:08.620
And to me, that was kind of like the fulfillment of the past two or three months of stop the

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:10.260
steal protest.

01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:15.140
And to me, it looked like the American people were waking up, rising up and all of that.

01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:16.980
Everything else was a fulfillment of it too.

01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:17.980
Yeah.

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:21.360
Everything else was the logical extension of the movement that you all have been pushing

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.360
down the road.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:23.360
Yep.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:29.540
Anyway, Nick has a little bit of a softer view on QAnon than Alex.

01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:30.540
Alex is pretty mad.

01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:34.380
And of course a large portion of it always comes down to he wants credit.

01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.380
Right.

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:37.820
And that is also where this clip is going to go.

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:41.820
But Nick kind of has a position more like, eh, it woke people up.

01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:50.020
The normie types, the suburban moms, you know, they, they now know about how all of the people

01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:51.620
I don't like are Dracula's.

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:52.620
Yeah.

01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:53.620
Yeah.

01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:57.060
Now that we've got the suburban moms terrified, we're on our way to victory.

01:20:57.060 --> 01:21:01.220
He sees the utility in that and thinks that there's probably still some ability to get

01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:05.420
those people back into a profitable revenue stream.

01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:10.540
The good thing about QAnon, I always thought was that it got a lot of regular people to

01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:13.700
believe the right things, even if they were believing them for the wrong reasons.

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:19.140
You know, it took a lot of maybe mainstream conservative Republican types who believe

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:24.500
this usual stuff about small government and free trade and mass immigration and low taxes.

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:28.360
And I think it woke them up about the power of the elites and the evil and the corruption

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:33.540
of the elites and kind of this international thing that's going on with all the work that

01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:37.780
I did and countless others did and you've been around a while, did, and it became Q

01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:41.340
like, Oh, Q knows about this and then it, but don't worry, everything's fine.

01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:42.340
But, but, but I mean, I agree.

01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:44.420
It was kind of a pop way for the general public.

01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:46.420
It was just now waking up to get into it.

01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:50.100
See, the thing that I liked about that is that Alex is, is pissed off that he's not

01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:51.100
getting credit.

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:55.620
Once again, I want credit for, and in order to not sound like a super petty asshole, he's

01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:59.940
like, you've been around a while and it's like 22 years old.

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:00.940
He's a vet now.

01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:01.940
He's a veteran.

01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:03.380
He was there at the storm in the Capitol.

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:05.220
There's no rookies anymore, Dan.

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:09.620
He was in high school at the 2016 election.

01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:10.940
I know I heard him debate.

01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:11.940
It was garbage.

01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:12.940
Yeah.

01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:13.940
Yeah.

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:14.940
Granted.

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:16.740
He was at the unite the right rally and the storming of the Capitol.

01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:23.460
He's seen some shit, but he's not been around a while in the way that Alex is pretending.

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:25.500
You were a big fan of bill Cooper back in the day.

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:26.500
You're nine.

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:27.500
Oh, I'm in trouble.

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.940
Let me tell you about scousing.

01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:32.500
So it's our last clip here.

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:38.980
Nick is just talking about how the globalists fear Alex because he has an audience.

01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:43.660
He can reach people, but what they feared about you and what they feared about Joe Rogan

01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:48.860
and a lot of these people is that you have your own totally independent infrastructure

01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:53.940
broadcasting to millions and millions of people you still do, and they don't control you and

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:55.780
they don't control what you say.

01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:58.180
They want to control everything that people hear.

01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:02.020
They want to control what's on their phones, want to control what's on their TV, on their

01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.020
radio.

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:05.840
They're freaking out that I'm pointing out that the boogaloo's are still on Twitter and

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:06.840
you and I aren't.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.500
Nick is still verified on Twitter.

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:09.500
Oh yeah.

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:10.500
It's still there.

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:11.500
Yeah.

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:12.500
Yeah.

01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:13.500
So that kind of punctures that.

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:14.500
I don't know.

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:21.100
I think it's less that everybody wants to control how everybody speaks and all that

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:25.100
and more, you know, there's certain platforms that just don't put up with certain behaviors

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:31.460
and you guys have crossed those lines to the point where people are going to take it seriously.

01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:35.180
And I would assume that if those boogaloo accounts, you know, you can show that they

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:38.820
were involved in X, Y, or Z and report them, they will be banned.

01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:42.940
They will be kicked off, I would assume.

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:46.340
And I don't know who he's talking about, so I can't even fact check it.

01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:50.580
I can't go look for every account that has hashtag boogaloo in it and that's not even

01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:51.580
going to help.

01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:56.700
Then I have to go through hashtag big igloo, all the weird fun ways everybody spells things.

01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:57.700
I can't do that.

01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:58.700
Yeah.

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.300
You're making a nonsense statement.

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:03.900
It's almost like vague information from an unknown source.

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:05.620
It's satanic.

01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:11.260
It's hard not to hear them saying like, okay, well we used to never have to think about

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.840
how people feel.

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:17.180
Then they started asking us to think about how we feel and we stormed the Capitol and

01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:21.380
now they're demanding that we think about how other people feel and they're giving us

01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:23.660
consequences when we don't.

01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:26.860
That sounds like exactly what they're saying, right?

01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:27.860
There's some overlap.

01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:28.860
Yeah.

01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:33.440
I find this to be sad.

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:37.140
This was not a good couple of days for Alex.

01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:42.660
It wasn't even like, maybe he's holding back for the, you know, the long-

01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:44.620
For the marathon.

01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:50.900
The inauguration day, but like, I don't know, it's the last two days and like he mustered

01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:55.540
up his fake last show on the 19th, or I'm sorry, on the 18th and it was just sort of

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:59.660
like, it wasn't anything, it was a, it was a real disappointing crescendo.

01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:02.020
I just got nothing.

01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:03.020
Yeah.

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:04.660
I mean, that's not terrible.

01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:08.540
You know, you've had that day where you know that at the, at the end of the week, you're

01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:13.500
going to have the worst, like longest day and the day before that, the day before that,

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:15.620
you're like, you know what, I'm going to take it easy today.

01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:19.680
I'm just going to do my job, but I'm not really going to, you know, go hard.

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:24.140
I'm going to yell a little bit and then I'm going to-

01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:27.020
I got, I got a lot of things to scream about.

01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:32.060
I'm going to lie, but then I'm just going to take it easy, man.

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:38.220
I imagine maybe he's been too busy writing that book about inner peace.

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:48.340
I do think, even if everything sucks and nothing is really going on here, I would have done

01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:52.140
this episode just for that clip where Alex is gone.

01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:53.140
When Jason Jones-

01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:54.140
That's so good.

01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:55.140
That's so good.

01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:56.300
I just want that there.

01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.660
I will say this, I will make this pledge.

01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:03.100
If Alex does write that book, I will edit it for free, 100% for free.

01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:06.680
I will do an audio book of it in my Alex impression.

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:07.680
That will be-

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:08.680
Absolutely.

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:09.680
Absolutely.

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.620
That is the one thing we will do for Alex in our career.

01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:13.620
Breathe.

01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:19.900
We will be back, Jordan, with the inauguration spectacular 2020.

01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:20.900
Indeed.

01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:23.620
And I said 2020 because Alex, that's what's on the tombstone.

01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:26.340
Yes, I see that.

01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:29.660
We'll do that on Monday and I'm excited for that, but until then we have a website.

01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:30.660
We do have a website.

01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:31.660
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:32.660
Yes.

01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:33.660
We're also on Twitter.

01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:34.660
We are on Twitter.

01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:35.660
It's at knowledgefight.net.

01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:36.660
Go to bed, Jordan.

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:37.660
You're also on Facebook.

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:43.100
And if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:44.100
doing God's work.

01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:45.100
Yeah, we'll be back.

01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:46.100
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:47.100
I'm Leo.

01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:48.100
I'm DZXClark.

01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:49.100
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:51.300
I am constantly fighting the devil.

01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:52.300
Andy in Kansas.

01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:53.300
You're on the air.

01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:54.300
Thanks for holding.

01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:55.300
Hello, Alex.

01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:56.300
I'm a first time caller.

01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:57.300
I'm a huge fan.

01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:58.300
I love your work.

01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:08.060
I love you.
