N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,440
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,120
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,240
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,240
Knowledgefight.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,240
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,240
Want to learn?

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,040
Need, need Money.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,240
G dispensaries labor.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,740
TSD Community Veterans Office.

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:50,320
Stop it, Andy Tian MP and the looped up to the rollins.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:50,060
Boston color

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,100
with your band and love your world Sit sculpture.

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,100
I love you.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,100
Hey everybody!

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,100
Welcome back to Knowledge Fat, I'm Dan.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,100
I'm Jordan.

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,380
We're a couple dudes that like to sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk a little

20
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,380
bit about Alex Jones.

21
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,380
Oh indeed we are Dan.

22
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,380
Jordan.

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,380
Dan!

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,380
Jordan!

25
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,380
I have a quick question for you.

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,380
What up?

27
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,380
What's your bright spot today?

28
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,720
My bright spot today Jordan is actually a little bit of something that we need to play

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,720
catch up on.

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,720
Okay.

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,720
Alright.

32
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,740
A little bit back we got something in the mail bags, yep, from Hannah out in Erie, Pennsylvania.

33
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,740
Alright.

34
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,740
Alright.

35
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,980
And I need to make good on this.

36
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,980
How are our sisters doing?

37
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,980
Ah they're great.

38
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,980
Okay good.

39
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,260
Hannah sent us some chocolates.

40
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,260
Okay.

41
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,700
From Erie, Pennsylvania.

42
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,820
The Pride of Erie.

43
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,820
Yes.

44
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,340
Some sponge candy from two different brands.

45
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,340
Okay.

46
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,340
Romolo.

47
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,340
Uh huh.

48
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,340
And what is this other one?

49
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,340
It's Stefa something or other.

50
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,340
Stefa something or other.

51
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,340
Stefanelli's!

52
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,340
Stefanelli's!

53
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,340
I like it.

54
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:57,260
Hannah asked us to, how did Hannah put it, there is a rivalry between two families in

55
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,800
Erie that are chocolatiers.

56
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,300
One makes a chocolate that is deemed quote better than the other.

57
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,080
I want you two to do a blindish taste test between the two milk chocolate sponge candies

58
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,660
and so we did that before the show because chewing into the mic does disgust some people.

59
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,140
Many people find it horrific.

60
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,660
We don't want to set anyone off.

61
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,820
So I, we've tried these and Hannah would like us to guess which one is the classier one

62
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,120
or just considered the classier one and I say it's Stefanelli's.

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,660
And I say it is Gondola's, nope what is it?

64
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,660
Romolo.

65
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,660
Yeah Gondola.

66
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,660
Gondola.

67
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,660
Yeah.

68
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,400
I got Gondor on the brain so, no I say it's the reverse.

69
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,660
My bright spot is that I think I'm pretty sure I'm right in advance.

70
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,940
I'm not saying that you're not, I'm just, I'm playing the game.

71
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,620
Exactly, we were talking about this before we started recording as we were eating the

72
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,140
chocolates and your reason for choosing Romolo is almost oppositional defiance.

73
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,140
No it's not!

74
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,980
Why would you ask the question?

75
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,820
We both agree which one tastes better.

76
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,340
Because it's a local thing.

77
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,220
It's something that people outside of Erie probably don't know too much about these rival

78
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,220
chocolatiers.

79
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,220
Hatfields and McCoys of chocolate.

80
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,580
Sure, sure, I just assumed that one of them, if it's better it's the less, or if the one

81
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,660
that people assume is better is the one that we're supposed to say is not as good.

82
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,460
I don't think that either of them were bad.

83
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,180
No, no, they're both delicious.

84
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,180
They were both fine.

85
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,180
Love it.

86
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,340
I just think the Romolo was a little bit, the chocolate was a little too dry.

87
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,340
A little thicker?

88
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,340
Yes.

89
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,340
Doesn't melt in your mouth.

90
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,340
No.

91
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,340
No, absolutely not.

92
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,340
Anyway, that's my bright spot.

93
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,340
Indeed.

94
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,340
Sponge candy.

95
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,340
It's delicious.

96
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,340
Absolutely.

97
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,340
Jordan?

98
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,380
Dan, I have the rare triple bright spot.

99
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,100
The rare triple bright spot.

100
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,100
He's batting for the cycle.

101
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,100
Absolutely.

102
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,900
Wait, you need quadruple for that.

103
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,820
First things first, somebody reached out to me, sent me an email, and they had done a

104
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,860
better job of converting my terrible PDF into an EPUB and a MOBI than I could ever do.

105
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,860
Oh, that's awesome.

106
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,060
Yeah, huge shout out to Old Man Sitko, as he would like to be named.

107
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,060
All right.

108
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,540
Yeah, the formatting of your book left something to be desired.

109
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,540
It was awful.

110
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,700
I tried everything 30 different times.

111
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,700
It's hard.

112
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,100
It's just like, I can't, yeah.

113
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,100
He did an amazing job.

114
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:16,540
Second, I was going back through my... I've been writing about music for a while now.

115
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,540
So I've been-

116
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,540
Mostly Taylor Swift.

117
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,620
Digging, almost entirely Taylor Swift.

118
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,380
But I've been digging through all my old crates and stuff like that, and I finally re-listened

119
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:31,300
to the Feist version of Lover's Spit by The Broken Social Scene.

120
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,900
I think it was off Beehives or something like that.

121
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,900
So good.

122
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,460
Feist manages to be both sonorous and breathy at the same time, and it's incredible.

123
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,460
Okay.

124
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,460
It's beautiful.

125
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,460
And then the third is something that you just gave to me-

126
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,460
Yeah.

127
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,460
Well, I didn't give it to you.

128
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,460
No, no, no.

129
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,460
You did not.

130
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,460
You handed it to me.

131
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,460
Yes.

132
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,460
Physically.

133
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,300
That comes from the... What was mine again?

134
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,300
What?

135
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,940
I had a mail bin.

136
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,940
What did I have?

137
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,940
I don't know.

138
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,940
A box?

139
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,940
It's not my job to remember your passive aggressive kits.

140
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,940
I think I remember there was a... Wow.

141
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,060
That's not my job.

142
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:10,500
I just thought you would be offended enough by them that you... Anyways, I was sent by-

143
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,740
Yeah, from Amy.

144
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,740
From Amy.

145
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,740
Raptor Princess Amy.

146
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,820
Raptor Princess Amy, a signed copy of, I believe, the first American edition of The Long Dark

147
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,100
Tea Time of the Soul by Douglas Adams.

148
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,140
It was your favorite book of Doug's.

149
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,480
It is maybe my favorite book.

150
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,140
This one and So Long and Thanks for All the Fish are my two favorites.

151
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,140
That's really awesome.

152
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,140
Yeah.

153
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,140
That's amazing.

154
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,140
No, it's incredible.

155
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,220
Actually, in that package, I also got a survival heirloom seed vault.

156
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,220
Yes, gorgeous.

157
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,220
And some awesome socks.

158
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,340
A little known fact about Dan, I'm a man who likes funny socks.

159
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,580
He's a man who likes funny socks.

160
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,720
One of them says crazy cat dude and has some cats on it, and the other one is a pro wrestling

161
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
themed socks.

162
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
I'm very excited.

163
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Fantastic.

164
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
Thank you, Amy.

165
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Yes, thank you very much.

166
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
That's very nice of you.

167
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,220
I was going to get to that on our next mini episode.

168
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,220
Sure.

169
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,220
Sure.

170
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,220
I can't.

171
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,180
I mean, you handed it to me, and I need to tell the world because it's incredible for

172
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,180
me.

173
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,180
It's a huge moment.

174
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,180
Yeah.

175
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,180
I'm very excited.

176
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,140
We might have to stop the show.

177
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,140
Yeah.

178
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:19,020
I'm a little overstimulated right now, but it's incredible.

179
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,020
Take some breaths.

180
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,020
I will.

181
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,020
Because we got some stuff to go over today.

182
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,020
I will.

183
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,020
Let's do it.

184
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,940
Today, Jordan, we're going to be going over Inauguration 2021, Black Jack.

185
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,940
Black Jack.

186
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
Now you're so fast.

187
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,580
But I'm trying to beat you to it.

188
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,900
Yeah, no, I got to race you.

189
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,900
This is going to get weird.

190
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,800
Yeah, it is.

191
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,460
The rule is you can't start saying Black Jack until one gets out of my mouth.

192
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,800
No, it's traditional Jeopardy rules.

193
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
You have to buzz in.

194
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Oh.

195
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,180
So on Jeopardy, you have to wait until the sentence, the question is finished, and then

196
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,900
you have like 0.001 second to buzz in, and whoever does it fastest.

197
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,900
But if you click it too soon...

198
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,900
Do I have to buzz?

199
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,900
No, you don't have to buzz.

200
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,900
Okay.

201
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,900
It's just a game.

202
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,900
Okay.

203
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,900
We'll figure it out as we go along.

204
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,900
Anyway, we're talking about Inauguration Day.

205
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,840
And Alex set out to do a marathon all day.

206
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,080
And part of the reason for this is that he was expecting a false flag terrorist attack

207
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
to happen.

208
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
Totally.

209
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
It did not happen.

210
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
Totally.

211
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,060
And so it kind of falls apart, the idea of it being a marathon.

212
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,060
Naturally.

213
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,300
Pretty quick.

214
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,740
So today what we're going to be doing is we're going to be going over the American Journal,

215
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,460
hosted by Harrison Smith.

216
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,460
Okay.

217
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,620
Some other issues about Harrison Smith.

218
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,620
Right.

219
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,580
Then Alex Jones' show, Until John Rappaport Takes Over the Fourth Hour.

220
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,580
Sure.

221
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,580
He's going to also do the War Room.

222
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:37,300
But by that point, this thing had ground to a halt to such an extent that I just was like,

223
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,060
I got no interest in this.

224
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,020
And the American Journal I honestly think was a bit more interesting than I expected

225
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,020
it to be.

226
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,380
And there's some issues that we really need to talk about.

227
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,380
All right.

228
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,380
Let's do it.

229
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,940
About this fucking ding-dong named Harrison.

230
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,860
Also I'd like to say, what could have been one of my bright spots is all of the stories

231
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,060
that are coming out about Alex losing his appeal in the Texas Supreme Court.

232
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,060
Oh yeah.

233
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,420
We are aware of that, but inauguration must be taken care of before we jump down that

234
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,420
road.

235
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,420
So we'll deal with that later in the week.

236
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,420
Absolutely.

237
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,020
For all those who were champing at the bit for us to get to that.

238
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,020
Yeah.

239
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,980
Before we get down to inauguration though, we've got to thank some Joe Biden donors.

240
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,660
Oh, that's a good idea.

241
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,140
I don't know that to be the case at all.

242
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,140
I don't know if any.

243
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,340
Some people who have supported our show had signed up in our policy wonks.

244
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,340
Yeah.

245
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,340
So first, Elliott Morgan, thank you so much.

246
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,580
You are now a policy wonk.

247
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,580
I'm a policy wonk.

248
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,580
Thank you, Elliott.

249
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,580
Thank you.

250
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,580
Next.

251
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,580
Don DeGran Prix's ghost.

252
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,580
Thank you so much.

253
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,580
You are now a policy wonk.

254
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,580
I'm a policy wonk.

255
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,580
Thank you very much, Don DeGran.

256
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,580
How's he doing in heaven?

257
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,580
Bad news.

258
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,580
No.

259
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,580
Bad news.

260
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,580
Well, he's doing good in heaven, actually.

261
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,580
Is he doing good in heaven?

262
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,580
I don't think he made it.

263
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,580
Grifter heaven.

264
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,580
Yeah.

265
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,580
Next, Andrew Kemp.

266
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,580
Thank you so much.

267
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,580
You are now a policy wonk.

268
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,580
I'm a policy wonk.

269
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,580
Thank you, Andrew.

270
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,580
Thank you.

271
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,860
Next, Corey, and actually Corey made an interesting request, and that is that he'd like to be

272
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,980
known as a policy wonk, so congratulations, Corey.

273
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,340
You're a policy wonk.

274
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,580
I'm a policy wonk.

275
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,240
Thank you very much.

276
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Policy wonk, Corey.

277
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,900
I said Corey's a dog.

278
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,900
Could be.

279
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,900
Yeah.

280
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,900
Next, I'm a doctor, and my time is precious.

281
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,900
Thank you so much.

282
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,900
You are now a policy wonk.

283
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,900
I'm a policy wonk.

284
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,900
Thank you very much, and we agree.

285
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,900
Yeah.

286
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,900
Yeah.

287
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,620
Next, Mr. Muscarello, a very fine fellow.

288
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,620
Thank you so much.

289
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,900
You are now a policy wonk.

290
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
I'm a policy wonk.

291
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,900
Thank you so much.

292
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,940
Thank you very much.

293
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,780
Why not Mr. Toad's Wild Ride?

294
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,020
Let's just roll with it.

295
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,500
Gregorium's Wonder Emporium.

296
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,100
Then finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple folks who signed up on an elevated

297
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,100
level.

298
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,100
I appreciate that very much.

299
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,740
So, Jodie C., not the band Jodeci.

300
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,740
Jodie C.

301
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,740
Jodie C.

302
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740
Yes.

303
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,740
Thank you so much.

304
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,740
You are now a technocrat.

305
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,740
Lord Subwalled.

306
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,740
Thank you so much.

307
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,740
You are now a technocrat.

308
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,740
But it was the band Lord Subwalled.

309
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,740
Yes, it was.

310
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,740
Yes.

311
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,860
And Dan didn't read my joke name when I became a policy wonk.

312
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,860
Thank you so much.

313
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,860
You are now a technocrat.

314
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,860
I'm a policy wonk.

315
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,860
Crikey, mate.

316
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,860
That's fantastic.

317
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,860
Have yourself a brew.

318
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,860
How's your 401k doing, bro?

319
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,860
All right.

320
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,860
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

321
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,340
Let's just get down to business.

322
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,420
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

323
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,340
Why are you pimps so good?

324
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,980
My neck is freakishly large.

325
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,760
I declare info war on you.

326
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Thank you so much, all.

327
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
Yes.

328
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,460
And there's a certain irony to this, too, and that is that I still didn't say whatever

329
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,460
the joke name is.

330
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:22,360
Well, I was thinking about it, and I was like, our inability to get to your joke name immediately

331
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,060
is in some ways a passive extortion.

332
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,580
You got to get up to technocrat if you want to jump to the line.

333
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,580
That's not the joke name.

334
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,660
No, of course not.

335
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,220
I don't know what the joke name was.

336
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,220
I don't know.

337
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,220
I lose track.

338
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,220
I can't keep track of this stuff.

339
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,460
Anyway, Jordan, we're going to jump in here at the beginning, where it all started.

340
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,260
In the beginning, there was the word.

341
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,780
I was going to say, we're going all the way back, huh?

342
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,580
No, let's skip back a little bit.

343
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,580
Little bit.

344
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,580
Little bit.

345
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
Okay, move forward.

346
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,580
The beginning of the day.

347
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,580
Abraham baguette, and then, okay.

348
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,020
Eventually you get down the line and you find Harrison Smith, and he's sitting at a desk

349
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,340
and America has fallen.

350
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,340
Okay.

351
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,340
You're watching American Journal.

352
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:07,560
This is a dirge of sorts, a funeral song for the United States, for the Republic as we

353
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,560
know it.

354
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,300
This is now a wartime broadcast.

355
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,060
America, the Republic has fallen.

356
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,060
Again.

357
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:23,140
With Donald Trump vacating the office, leaving the White House, and taking Air Force One

358
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,820
while he still can to Florida.

359
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,620
These people are intensely dramatic.

360
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,620
I know.

361
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,620
This is so...

362
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,620
Yeah.

363
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,620
Yeah.

364
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,620
All right.

365
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,300
I think I start to realize when I look through the prism of people similar to Harrison or

366
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,500
to Mike Adams and their just overly dramatic tendencies, I kind of realize that Alex is

367
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,780
the same, except the way it manifests isn't like this weird over the top modeling America

368
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,860
has fallen.

369
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,900
It's kind of sci-fi and a little horror-y.

370
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,900
Yeah.

371
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
Yeah.

372
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,900
I think that's why it's a little bit less like obviously like really dramatic.

373
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:05,060
It is a little bit like what's going on is these are all the theater kids who are so

374
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,800
into masculinity they couldn't join the theater program, and so they're trying to get all

375
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,180
this theater kid stuff out.

376
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,340
I would have been a theater kid, but they were too inclusive.

377
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,340
Exactly.

378
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,340
Totally.

379
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,340
100 percent.

380
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,340
Yeah.

381
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,340
I tried debate.

382
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,340
Yeah.

383
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,060
I had to play football because I was too manly.

384
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,180
Harrison did not play football.

385
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,180
No.

386
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,180
Well, that's probably true.

387
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,180
He's too much of a theater kid.

388
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,180
Too much.

389
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,180
Yeah.

390
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,180
So there's an interesting dynamic that's going on throughout most of the coverage here on

391
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:37,060
the 20th, and that is wrestling with Trump's legacy in the last hour of his presidency.

392
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,060
Okay.

393
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,740
Harrison comes solidly down on the side of that dude done fucked up.

394
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:50,780
And I got to be honest, Donald Trump completely failed, utterly, totally failed.

395
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:58,180
I was having this debate with my dad yesterday, and he was saying, you know, Trump was probably

396
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,820
the greatest president in my lifetime.

397
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,540
I said, it doesn't matter.

398
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,820
He failed.

399
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:11,380
He left us not with any lasting triumph, but with ash.

400
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,660
You got some ash.

401
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,300
I mean, I think a lot of people probably predicted this.

402
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,300
Who?

403
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
How?

404
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
Why?

405
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,300
When?

406
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
Everyone.

407
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,380
What kind of person would possibly have predicted this?

408
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,060
Remember when he was elected president, Dan?

409
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,140
We were meant to give him a chance.

410
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,140
Yeah.

411
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,140
You know?

412
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:38,620
It's tough, I guess, to hear aspiring authoritarian dictator servers sad that they don't get to,

413
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,660
you know, that their guy wasn't strong enough to get them to the point where they could

414
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,660
be his servants.

415
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,620
I was hoping that the boot I was licking was strong and powerful, and it turns out it was

416
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,340
weak, ineffectual, and a grifter just like my boot.

417
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,380
I can't believe that my tongue made it all the way through that boot.

418
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,100
So quickly, too.

419
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,020
How many licks does it take to get to the center of Trump's boot?

420
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,780
I will say this about Harrison, though.

421
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,780
What's that?

422
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,980
Um, for all the, like, hey, Trump has failed kind of talk, he's a big man.

423
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
He's a big man.

424
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,900
He's big enough to admit that he was wrong.

425
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,900
Okay.

426
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:16,300
Although this clip is only 34 seconds long, and it ends with him saying, I wasn't actually

427
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
wrong.

428
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
Okay, well.

429
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:24,660
We thought he had what it took to do what was necessary to save this country.

430
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:35,900
And it would, I guess it would feel embarrassing if I cared about that sort of thing.

431
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:41,500
I'm not too big to admit that we were wrong.

432
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,620
We weren't wrong, really.

433
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,620
He could have.

434
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,620
He could have done it.

435
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,620
He just didn't.

436
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,620
He just didn't do it.

437
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,180
He didn't do it.

438
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,300
He didn't have what it takes.

439
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,300
Wow.

440
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,020
I'm big enough to admit we were wrong.

441
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,020
Actually, nevermind.

442
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
I am not.

443
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
Nevermind.

444
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,020
We weren't wrong.

445
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,020
Indeed.

446
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,020
I am not big enough to admit we were wrong.

447
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,020
Hold on.

448
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,020
Late breaking news.

449
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
We weren't wrong.

450
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,020
Excuse me, sir.

451
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,460
Denial can only get to you in the cliff.

452
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,340
It cannot get you to jump over it.

453
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,340
Yeah.

454
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
That's pretty amazing.

455
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,340
That's.

456
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,980
I'm a big enough man to admit I was wrong.

457
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,980
Actually, I was right.

458
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,980
Trump fucked up.

459
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:21,840
I do like that he's completely missing the point of being a big enough man is the sense

460
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,900
of like, I am an adult by immediately undercutting it.

461
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:32,140
Well, and I think also, it's my experience that when you talk about like being big enough

462
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:37,180
to admit you're wrong, that's usually the byproduct of like introspection and it's clear

463
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:43,700
that this isn't something that has been wrestled with or like, huh, what was it that led us

464
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,500
down the road to thinking that Trump was going to be our king?

465
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,160
No, it's almost like he'd heard other people say I'm a big enough man to admit when I'm

466
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
wrong a lot.

467
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,820
Maybe his dad, who is debating.

468
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,180
Yeah, yeah, this is supposed to be the thing that I say and then he walks it back because

469
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,100
he doesn't understand it whatsoever.

470
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,100
Yeah.

471
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,300
So there's another thing that's going on in Info Wars right now, of course.

472
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,500
Anybody who's listened to our shows aware of this, they're really mad at Q and QAnon.

473
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:15,900
And so Harrison is also there and he has this expression that he keeps using and that is

474
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:22,940
politics is war deferred, but that deferment no longer exists.

475
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,940
Okay.

476
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,780
We've never lied to you folks.

477
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:31,460
We have never put a friendly face on something that was horrific.

478
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,340
We have never told you to trust the plan that people were working behind the scenes that

479
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,340
you needed to do nothing.

480
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,340
Oh, really?

481
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,660
We've always shot straight here at Info Wars, so that's what I'm going to try to do today.

482
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,660
Really?

483
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:53,740
I'm going to try to do it in a way that doesn't get me on a list of some sort because this

484
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,620
is a brave new world.

485
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,620
Yuck.

486
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:02,140
This is a new situation that we are in.

487
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,740
We've been discussing it this entire week, really ever since the sixth.

488
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,740
Drink some coffee.

489
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,740
Yeah.

490
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,740
It is no longer safe to...

491
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,740
Hurry it up.

492
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,500
... express yourself believing that the First Amendment will protect you.

493
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,220
He says, broadcasting lies.

494
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,060
It's not the case anymore and we'll go through some major stories that show you that.

495
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:25,140
I don't want to show this video, this is a rant Alex Jones went on yesterday that I

496
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:32,620
think lays it out fairly well because this is a war now.

497
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:42,840
If politics is war deferred, if politics is a replacement for war where people we elect

498
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:52,320
do our fighting for us in the halls of government rather than us brawling it out in the streets,

499
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,060
that is no longer the case.

500
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,580
All right, so I guess it's time to brawl in the streets, Harrison.

501
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,940
I don't like his understanding of politics very much.

502
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,260
It can't be war deferred and also a replacement for war.

503
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,800
It's a delaying tactic.

504
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,980
If that's your description of democracy, we have a real problem.

505
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,980
It's troubling.

506
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,340
I think, again, this is just like him repeating things he's heard that do sound pretty good

507
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,340
if you're not paying attention.

508
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,340
Yeah, they do sound good.

509
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,660
Yeah, they roll off you pretty okay.

510
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,860
Politics is war deferred sounds like something someone strong would say.

511
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,300
Now here's the thing that's really funny.

512
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:33,220
He's introducing a report from Alex because Alex went on that rant about migrants and

513
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:39,340
so he's going to play that, but what's really funny is that at the end of that rant that

514
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:45,220
Alex did, he throws it to a Harrison Smith piece and so at the end of the video that

515
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,340
Harrison plays, Alex references a Harrison Smith video and then there's a long silence

516
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,020
or Harrison's like, oh God.

517
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,580
Okay, so it's like an ouroboros of bullshit.

518
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

519
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,660
But this gets Harrison into thinking about how like, hey, if you're white and you're

520
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,300
young, shit's going to be bad.

521
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,300
If you're...

522
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,300
Yeah, yeah.

523
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,300
Calm down.

524
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,300
Calm down.

525
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,300
This is going to get really bad.

526
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,300
Okay.

527
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,660
But if you're like 50, you could just go out to the woods and wait it out.

528
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,660
You'll be fine.

529
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,660
All right.

530
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,660
But your children.

531
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,660
Okay.

532
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,660
Oh, think of the children.

533
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,660
Oh boy.

534
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,420
If you're over 50 or whatever, you might be able to live the rest of your life off your

535
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:30,580
meager retirement, enjoy it, have a nice little place in the mountains, watch the sunset,

536
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:37,620
drink your wine, listen to your old music, but your children and your children's children

537
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:45,520
are going to be a despised minority with no rights, no future, no ability to make anything

538
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,220
of themselves robbed constantly and the money given to people who hate them in order to

539
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,220
replace them.

540
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,220
Okay.

541
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,460
So you can't just ignore this anymore.

542
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,300
And if you do, you're part of the problem.

543
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,260
You need to be involved.

544
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,500
You need to be aware and we need to fight.

545
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Not politically, literally.

546
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,760
I'm not calling for violence.

547
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:16,260
I'm letting you know violence is upon us implemented through the state.

548
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,060
So you're surgically.

549
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:24,180
So there seems to me to be very little difference between that mentality that Harrison is expressing

550
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:29,260
and the tiki torch wielding Nazis at the unite the right rally chanting Jews will not replace

551
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,260
us.

552
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,260
Yeah.

553
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,260
I'm going to go with zero difference.

554
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,260
I listened to info Wars a lot.

555
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,740
In my perspective, that was a very explicit overt plea to white nationalism to the point

556
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,300
where I was shocked by how blunt it was.

557
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,740
I was wondering what was up here.

558
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,460
So I went to the American journal page on band.video and there's some pretty mask off

559
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,980
stuff going on over there.

560
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,980
That doesn't surprise me.

561
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,900
Perhaps the most telling video title you'll immediately be confronted by is from January

562
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,480
21st titled quote, stop white genocide.

563
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,500
That is an intensely direct title for a video and the description really says it all quote

564
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,820
Harrison Smith explains why migration is the choice weapon of the elite when trying to

565
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,900
dominate and destroy a population.

566
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,900
Okay.

567
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,280
Oh boy.

568
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,940
It's tough to be more clear than this.

569
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,140
Harrison Smith is explicitly disseminating white nationalist narratives on the info Wars

570
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,340
morning show, which I recall, if I recall correctly, is supposed to be almost entirely

571
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,340
phone calls.

572
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,620
Yeah, I do remember that being the plan.

573
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,500
This is not something that's just like tacitly supported by Alex by virtue of the fact that

574
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,180
it's on his network.

575
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,820
It's just a more explicit recitation of the talking points that Alex himself spouts constantly.

576
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,820
Yeah.

577
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,860
It's almost like Alex hired Steve Doocy.

578
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,900
I didn't want to just point out that Harrison put out a video decrying his fears about white

579
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,540
genocide and then say that the work was done.

580
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,780
There are far too many lazy commentators who will react to titles of things without looking

581
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,100
at the body of the piece and I strive not to fall into that trap.

582
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,620
So I watched the video.

583
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,060
The structure that Harrison is going for is to make the argument that the treatment of

584
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,740
white Europeans in the United States is the same as the treatment of the Uyghur people

585
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,380
by the Chinese government, and if people are comfortable with saying that the treatment

586
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,380
of the Uyghurs could be called genocide, then Harrison's well within his rights to claim

587
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,380
that white people are the target of a genocide here and in Europe.

588
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,380
Uh.

589
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,380
Right.

590
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,780
In order to bolster this claim, Harrison does some pretty predictable false equivalencies.

591
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,220
For instance, he mentions that the Chinese government is accused of forcing Uyghurs to

592
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,500
be sterilized or be required to take birth control.

593
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,220
Harrison then claims that this is the same as the U.S. offering people birth control

594
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,500
and that somehow decades of propaganda are responsible for people making family planning

595
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
choices.

596
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
Yeah, that sounds right.

597
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,980
This is a completely insane false equivalence and I don't see a good way for Harrison to

598
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,500
defend that flimsy ass plank in his argument.

599
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
So he doesn't.

600
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
He just says it.

601
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:47,700
No, I don't think there's any way not to hear him say this and think what you're saying

602
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,680
is white men are going to be treated like white men have treated everybody else in this

603
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,860
country and that's worthy of killing everyone.

604
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,860
Hmm?

605
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,860
Maybe?

606
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Yeah.

607
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,060
So then, Harrison gets to the point in the video where the argument pivots to immigration

608
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:06,880
because at this point, you know, at the beginning he's laying out this groundwork and he's saying

609
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,460
that it's the same as the treatment of the Uyghurs.

610
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,460
Sure.

611
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,460
Nonsense.

612
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,460
Naturally.

613
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,820
Harrison's primary source that he's reading from is a July 4th article that was posted

614
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,620
on NPR.

615
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:22,500
Here Harrison discusses his contention that white people are being the subject of genocide.

616
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,500
As the government, and get this, and if this isn't genocide, I don't know what is.

617
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,140
The government has brought millions of Han Chinese settlers into the region with promises

618
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,020
of high salary, jobs, and free housing.

619
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:43,300
My God, ethnic migrants, economic migrants coming into a region for high paying jobs?

620
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,300
That's genocide, obviously, when it's in China.

621
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,300
What about here?

622
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,300
It's diversity here.

623
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,980
You have to understand the distinction, folks.

624
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,900
Do you support giving First Nations land back?

625
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,560
When happening to you, it's a good thing.

626
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,780
It's diversity.

627
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,780
It's our strength.

628
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,780
It's what we need.

629
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:04,300
When it's happening to Uyghur Muslims in China, it's genocide, by God.

630
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
What about white people?

631
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
This is what people...

632
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
I don't know.

633
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
I mean...

634
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
Hello.

635
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,300
Hello.

636
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,300
Come on.

637
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
Wake up, dammit.

638
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,300
So a couple of important points here.

639
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:18,040
The first is that the guy who was interviewed by NPR does not say that the form of immigration

640
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,680
that Harrison is discussing is genocide.

641
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,980
He says that it's a part of a, quote, policy of ethno-racial domination, which is still

642
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,580
bad, but it's not the same thing.

643
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,740
Harrison stops reading right before the guy says, quote, the reason why this has changed,

644
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,980
we do need to probably call it a genocide, is quite simply because the evidence now for

645
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,900
the first time very specifically meets one of the five criteria set forth by the UN Convention

646
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,980
for the Punishment and Prevention of the Crime of Genocide from 1948, which specifically

647
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,400
says the suppression of birth.

648
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,980
This guy is clearly expressing that bringing the Han Chinese to replace Uyghur workers

649
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,160
doesn't meet the definition of genocide.

650
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,300
But now that there's evidence of birth suppression, that does meet the definition according to

651
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,300
this guy.

652
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,300
Yeah.

653
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,880
Harrison is completely misrepresenting this researcher's words because his agenda is to

654
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,600
yell about immigration to the United States and stress white aggrievement, not to cover

655
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,480
any of these issues in a meaningful way that helps the audience better understand the world

656
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,160
and hopefully pushes public opinion towards better policy preferences.

657
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,820
He's trying to make white people scared of non-white people, and he's trying to use the

658
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,660
prop of the Chinese state oppression in order to justify his shoddy arguments.

659
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,380
None of the complaints that Harrison brings up here rise to the level of meeting the UN

660
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:32,060
definition of genocide, which is the standard of the conversation as presented in his primary

661
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,380
source.

662
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,220
Article 2 of the UN Convention lays out the five acts that constitute genocide, and what

663
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,460
makes it an even more difficult argument for Harrison to make is that it says, quote, genocide

664
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:47,100
means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part,

665
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,380
a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group.

666
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,420
The word intent is going to be a really serious problem for Harrison.

667
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,560
The argument he's setting out to make requires that he somehow demonstrate that immigration

668
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,780
of non-white people into the United States is being done with the intention of destroying

669
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,080
in whole or in part white people.

670
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,820
That's going to be really impossible for him to do without slipping into explicit white

671
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,460
supremacist or neo-Nazi conspiracy theories.

672
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:20,940
I mean, I would just have to say, manifest destiny, and if you want to start pulling

673
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,940
some shit, then fine, start giving land back to the First Nations.

674
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,400
Otherwise shut the fuck up, because these are the people who celebrate manifest destiny

675
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,460
as the greatest thing that's ever happened.

676
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,140
Well, it had something to do with God telling.

677
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,500
So Harrison goes on to complain some more in this piece.

678
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,520
We're taking a little side tour into his Stop White Genocide video, so this isn't from the

679
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:51,800
inauguration day, but I got really sort of curious when he was talking about your ancestors

680
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:57,060
being a hated minority, and all of that, it was like, this seems like code, and I wanted

681
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,780
to understand a little better, and then I found this Stop White Genocide piece, and

682
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,780
I was like, holy shit.

683
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,500
The United Nations Convention for the Punishment and Prevention of the Crime of Genocide from

684
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:18,660
1948 specifies the suppression of birth as one of the primary attributes of a genocide.

685
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:26,700
Now, if I was some sort of insane conspiracy theorist, I might point to the ongoing attempt

686
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:32,540
by many, many mainstream outlets to suppress the birth rate of white Americans.

687
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,480
Say white people don't have children.

688
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,980
You shouldn't have children, white people.

689
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,100
It goes on and on and on.

690
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,460
We've seen this headline over and over again, but that's not genocide.

691
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,640
That's a good thing, because remember, white people bad.

692
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,660
I don't think that makes Harrison sound like a conspiracy theorist.

693
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,800
I think it makes him sound like a flagrant racist.

694
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,460
That's exactly what it makes him sound like.

695
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,900
Harrison Smith isn't seeing the media constantly saying that white people shouldn't have kids

696
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,260
because they're not.

697
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,900
He's seeing things like interracial couples represented in commercials and sitcoms, and

698
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,880
he's experiencing that as an attempt to say that white people shouldn't just reproduce

699
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,100
with each other.

700
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,020
I decided to check out what happens when you Google white people shouldn't have kids.

701
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,980
Looking for some headlines, looking for some digging around.

702
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:22,260
Can I guess, just real quick, you are going to find roughly 10,000 reactionary right-wing

703
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,140
articles about this, and very few, if any.

704
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,140
Not so much.

705
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,660
I found the first eight results are just about raising children who are capable of talking

706
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,660
about race issues.

707
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,660
Oh, that's nice.

708
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,500
I don't say that white people shouldn't have kids.

709
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,740
The ninth result is a 2017 article out of The Independent titled, quote, seven reasons

710
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,860
people shouldn't have children according to science.

711
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,260
That has nothing to do with white people not having kids.

712
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,100
It's more of an exploration of the research into things like changing friendships after

713
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,300
one person has a kid and the other doesn't, or how according to one poll, quote, non-parents

714
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,020
tend to lead healthier lifestyles than parents.

715
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,220
Was that the one, okay, that was 2017, right?

716
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,220
Yeah.

717
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,540
I was interviewed for that one, and they rejected mine, which was white people don't have kids.

718
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,540
Oh.

719
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,540
Yeah.

720
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,540
Maybe Harrison got the early version.

721
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,300
Maybe Harrison accidentally talked to that one.

722
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,740
Then the results go back to being about, you know, people being able to talk about race

723
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,220
with children.

724
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:18,220
The closest thing that gets really, like, the closest to really complex racial issues

725
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,180
that you find is that there's a couple articles about, like, the dynamics of adoption.

726
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:27,300
Yeah, trans adoption is a real huge, yeah.

727
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,300
You see some articles discussing that, but that's not what Harrison's talking about.

728
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

729
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,340
You can't tell page seven of the search results to actually even find an article that's actually

730
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,620
about people advocating that people not have children, and again, it's not race-based.

731
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:44,500
It's a 2019 editorial piece on the BBC about a group called the Antinatalists, who just

732
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,940
want no one to have kids.

733
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,940
Yeah, well.

734
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,780
And there's also the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement there, but that's not racially based

735
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,780
either.

736
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:58,460
I assume Harrison also looked up a lot of New York Times articles and the like from

737
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:07,340
anywhere between 1878 and 1939, whenever everyone was advocating for black people to voluntarily

738
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,940
not have children ever again?

739
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,940
Nah.

740
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,940
Oh, okay.

741
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,940
I don't know.

742
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,180
I would like some citations.

743
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,220
I don't think that Harrison's making a serious point here.

744
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,860
I think this is just a white identity talking point being presented as if it represents

745
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,860
reality.

746
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,860
Totally.

747
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,860
And that's fucking gross.

748
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

749
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:29,460
And I would like more ideas, I would like concrete examples of what white men are going

750
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,620
to face, young white men are going to face, and I would like him to put those up on a

751
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:38,980
wall somewhere, just so we can refer back to them every time one of them occurs, I imagine.

752
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:45,180
I also just resent when people like this present this idea, like, we've seen all the hundred

753
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,900
articles telling white people not to have kids.

754
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,900
I haven't.

755
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,900
Name one.

756
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,900
Yeah.

757
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,900
Pick one.

758
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,900
Yeah.

759
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,540
And also, it can't be something that's clearly satire.

760
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,540
Yeah.

761
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,780
And it can't be something that you said.

762
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,540
Okay, if it's McSweeney's or me, then you don't get to reference it.

763
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:06,700
So like I said, this entire argument really just hinges on Harrison trying to make the

764
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:13,300
treatment of white people be equivalent to the Uyghur and other minority treatment in

765
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,300
China.

766
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,300
Sure.

767
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,860
I want to continue to lay out the case for white genocide, I guess, is what I'm doing

768
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,860
here, because after all, I'm one of these crazy conspiracy theorists that thinks genocide

769
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,860
is bad.

770
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,860
I agree.

771
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,860
I know.

772
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,300
It's just, it's just nutty.

773
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:35,540
I have this weird consistency where I think the genocide of the Uyghur people in China

774
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:41,940
is bad, and I think the genocide of European people in Europe is also bad.

775
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:49,660
I don't understand the complex geography that goes into determining whether one is

776
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,660
bad or not.

777
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,780
I just, I'm just such a simple guy.

778
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:58,660
To me, genocide equals bad, and I just don't have the college thinking, the university

779
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,280
brain that's necessary to understand why it's good when it's against white people and bad

780
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,820
when it's against the Uyghur minority.

781
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,300
I just, I just am too dumb, I guess.

782
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,300
I don't know.

783
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,060
I don't think Harrison is too stupid.

784
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,100
His problem isn't stupidity or not understanding, it's that he's outrageously racist, and he's

785
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,040
also unfortunately smart enough to know that it's bad for business to just admit that and

786
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040
live openly.

787
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,940
That's why he has to make these strained comparisons and false equivalencies to try

788
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,820
to pretend that the experience of being white in the United States or in Europe is in any

789
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,100
way comparable to being Uyghur in China.

790
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,940
That's a ludicrous proposition, and it's why he has to pretend that allegations of

791
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:38,440
forced sterilization in China are the same as the availability of birth control here.

792
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,420
Any right thinking person would hear that argument and recognize pretty quickly how

793
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,800
stupid it is, but that's because it's a crypto argument.

794
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,580
The argument or the false equivalence doesn't actually exist to be taken seriously.

795
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,060
It's only there because Harrison knows he can't come out and express his true white

796
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,260
nationalist positions without consequences.

797
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,380
I wouldn't say that genocide against Uyghurs is bad and genocide against white people is

798
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,380
good.

799
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,100
I would contest Harrison's point that the situations each group are facing are in any

800
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,220
way comparable, and that's where Harrison's argument would completely fall apart.

801
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,660
I know that because I was listening to a twenty minute video where he's trying to defend

802
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:16,700
that premise and he's failing embarrassingly and really letting his racism show.

803
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,580
But that said, the Lonely Shepherd by Zamfir slaps.

804
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,580
Okay.

805
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,580
All right.

806
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,580
All right.

807
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,580
Okay.

808
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,580
The king of the pan flute.

809
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,580
Oh.

810
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:31,580
Harrison does have a couple of decent music choices.

811
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,580
Okay.

812
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,980
He has some good cues that I haven't heard from other Infowars shows, including the Lonely

813
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,980
Shepherd.

814
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,980
Yeah.

815
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,980
I mean I would-

816
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,980
I guess it's the morning show.

817
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,980
You gotta be a little chiller.

818
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,980
Yeah.

819
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,980
That pan flute really does-

820
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,980
That wakes you up.

821
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:50,700
That Zamfir branded himself the king of the pan flute as if it was a crowded space.

822
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,740
Pop culture pan flutist.

823
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,180
I think that's why you have to brand yourself as a bombastic something, otherwise people

824
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,620
aren't gonna be like, oh this guy's really good at the pan flute.

825
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,900
He's the king of the pan flute.

826
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,300
It's like Chuck Mangione, the king of the flugelhorn.

827
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,380
He is the king of the flugelhorn, that's true.

828
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,500
No one's gonna fuck with his title.

829
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,500
He's not wrong.

830
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,500
No.

831
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,500
He's not wrong.

832
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,140
The Children of Sanchez, such a good song.

833
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,140
Good soundtrack.

834
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,140
Alright.

835
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,140
Anyway.

836
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:20,460
Harrison gets to going about, eh, he just keeps going.

837
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,460
Yeah.

838
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,740
The 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which

839
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:29,860
has been ratified by at least 149 countries, including China, defines genocide as any of

840
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:36,820
these acts committed with the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.

841
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,820
Killing its members, causing them seriously bodily or mental harm.

842
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:49,820
By the way, vast, vast majority of suicides, vast majority of medication for depression,

843
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,940
is all on white people.

844
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,980
But that's a good thing because white people are evil.

845
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:59,460
So even assuming that everything Harrison just said is true from a statistical perspective,

846
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,220
it's still meaningless in terms of his argument that there's a white genocide going on.

847
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:08,500
Again, he's using this 1948 UN definition of genocide that includes the word intent

848
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,980
as a really important element of the definition.

849
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,380
I mean, Harrison works for Infowars, so he probably shouldn't even care what the UN thinks

850
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,060
about the subject, but he's operating off that definition, so that's the conversation

851
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,500
that's being had.

852
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,100
In order for his argument to carry any weight, Harrison is going to have to demonstrate and

853
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,700
prove the following.

854
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:30,500
One, that there are in fact disproportionate medication and suicide rates between races

855
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,820
that cannot be explained by other factors, like income inequality or access to healthcare.

856
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,540
Two, that this is the result of a concerted plan by some group as an attempt to destroy

857
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,060
white people.

858
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,700
Harrison can't even come close to either of these.

859
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,540
The best he can do is suggest that mental health practices like psychiatric medication

860
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,260
are an attempt to kill off white people, and suggest that that's the way it is because

861
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,040
someone's out to get white people.

862
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,100
That's all he can do, because there is no argument here.

863
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,680
There's only an appeal to emotion, only an appeal to fear.

864
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,700
This is an attempt to give racist people listening a way to express their racism without sounding

865
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,700
racist.

866
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,700
It's honestly pretty pathetic.

867
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
Yeah.

868
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,820
Also, a recent paper from the Division of Vital Statistics out of the CDC reflects that

869
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:17,220
in 2017, once you adjust for population, the group with by far the highest rate of suicide

870
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,660
is non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native women.

871
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,660
I eagerly await Harrison's coverage of that.

872
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,340
Yeah, I would be interested to hear that.

873
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,100
Oh, I know, I wouldn't be interested to hear that.

874
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:31,480
So in order to bolster his claims that there's a white genocide going on, Harrison brings

875
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,140
up the case of Ireland.

876
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,960
He seems to think that their entire population is going to be replaced with immigrants because

877
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,880
of a need to do so in order to make their pension system work.

878
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,100
Here's the profoundly racist and idiotic way that his segment on white genocide ends, and

879
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:50,540
I will explain to you on the other side why this is very dumb.

880
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,740
I don't like what's happening to the Uyghurs in China.

881
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:59,220
We should be defending these people who are being systematically eradicated by their governmental

882
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,220
organizations.

883
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:05,980
And on the other hand, I don't want the people of Ireland to be systematically eliminated

884
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:10,280
by their super state governmental organization.

885
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,300
I don't think the pension system is worth replacing every single person in your country

886
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,180
with a foreigner.

887
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,500
There's plenty to go around.

888
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:25,340
Hell, there's more, there's more Bangladeshis in a single district of a single city of that

889
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,060
country than there are in the entire nation of Ireland.

890
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:32,240
So maybe we can help out Ireland, maybe we can help increase the birth rates, maybe we

891
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,220
can stop this genocide, at least in Ireland, and then maybe we can expand that to the rest

892
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,660
of the world and recognize that white people are a global minority, the least population

893
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:47,340
out of any racial division, if you want to take the big ones, Asian, black, whatever.

894
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:51,260
Whites are the smallest, and they're being genocided, and that's the headline.

895
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,700
Stop white genocide.

896
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,140
So Harrison is working off a primary source that's an article in the Independent out of

897
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,140
Ireland.

898
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,700
The headline of the article is, quote, Ireland needs four million migrants to sustain state

899
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,060
pension system.

900
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,540
Harrison takes that information and combines it with the fact that Ireland's population

901
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,860
is only like five million, so that must mean that they want to replace everyone with immigrants

902
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,180
to save the pension system.

903
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,880
Yeah, that sounds like the Irish.

904
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,300
The problem is that Harrison didn't do any work, like even reading the article.

905
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,140
The first thing that jumps out at you if you do read the article is that the idea that

906
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,820
the country needed four million migrants to make the pension system work was something

907
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,420
that was used as an illustration of the problem the country was facing regarding having an

908
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:36,140
aging population and meeting the pensions, in a meeting of the Pensions Committee.

909
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,540
It wasn't being suggested as the plan to fix the pension system.

910
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:44,380
They were saying that by 2051 they would need four million new people paying into the system

911
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:48,500
to balance out all the people over 65 drawing from it.

912
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,700
If Harrison wasn't such a dopey racist fuck, he would have kept reading to the part of

913
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,740
the article where it says, quote, but the statistician and commission members say it's

914
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,480
unlikely that net inward migration will reverse the current trends, and some migrants would

915
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,020
become pensioners themselves.

916
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,860
This article is about a discussion of why this wouldn't be a solid plan to fix the

917
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:12,180
pension system, because if that were the only approach taken, you'd end up creating more

918
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,160
net problems for the pension system than you fix.

919
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,280
The article goes on to say, quote, Irish fiscal advisory council chair Sebastian Barnes said

920
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,580
tax and spending would have to adjust to fund pensions while pension age would need to rise.

921
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,700
Social protection minister Heather Humphreys spoke at the first meeting and made it clear

922
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:33,100
that a reduction in the amount of state pension was not to be considered.

923
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,820
This article is not about Ireland bringing in four million migrants to fix the pension

924
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,060
system, but the headline is written in such a way that it's easy to use it that way.

925
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,980
The four million number is used as an illustration of the imbalance that will exist between those

926
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,020
paying into the system and those drawing from it, but because the headline is poorly written

927
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,760
and because Harrison's a lazy craven racist, this article can be used to justify an argument

928
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,620
that Ireland is engaging in white genocide in order to save its pension system.

929
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,500
Harrison knows what he's doing.

930
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,900
He knows that this article isn't about bringing in four million migrants to Ireland, but he

931
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,960
also knows that because it looks like it is, he can mislead his audience into thinking

932
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,740
that it is and hide his racist agenda behind that misrepresentation.

933
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,100
Anyway, that's the end of our side tour through Harrison Smith's piece on white genocide.

934
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,580
I can say with a fair amount of confidence that this special report was quite possibly

935
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:26,340
the most transparent and most poorly argued racism I've ever seen on Infowars.

936
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,020
It's the racism equivalent of Harrison saying that the capital had fallen and patriots were

937
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,020
in charge on January 6th.

938
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,900
He's not hiding what he is.

939
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,900
Yeah.

940
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,900
He is a fucking...

941
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,900
Yeah, this is...

942
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,380
Because what is he saying whenever he says we can stop the genocide of Ireland is just

943
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:48,220
we can make sure that Ireland remains a white nation, and then we can save everybody else.

944
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:54,820
So Europeans for European nations, Africans for African nations, Chinese people for China,

945
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,500
and no mixing at all.

946
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,460
And the primary source that he's working off of for this article is a headline that he's

947
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,660
misrepresenting in a way to use as a racist cudgel.

948
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,660
Totally.

949
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,660
Like, it's outrageous.

950
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,660
Yeah.

951
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:15,460
I mean, it's to be expected on some level, but it's pretty...

952
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:21,060
It's like using story math problems as like, okay, if the migrant caravan is racing towards

953
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,980
the border at 60 miles an hour, but the white nationalists are going towards the border

954
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,980
from the opposite direction at 50 miles an hour, then the white people will be exterminated.

955
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,980
I don't like this quiz.

956
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,980
Bad quiz.

957
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,420
Yeah, it is a bad quiz.

958
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:37,980
I started to wonder about this, and one of the things that I think is interesting is

959
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:42,140
that like, yeah, I mean, a lot of the same themes are exactly the same as what Alex talks

960
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,360
about, but just more crypto.

961
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:50,460
Like Alex is way, way less close to the edge, let's say, than Harrison, because he knows

962
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,460
that there's consequences for being too overtly racist.

963
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,020
People will treat you in a certain way.

964
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,700
He'll lose his ability to argue, oh, everyone says I'm a racist, they all lie about me,

965
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,700
that kind of shit.

966
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,740
I just wonder, you know, it makes me feel like there's two possible dynamics, and one

967
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:13,180
is that like Alex is thinking, fuck it, let Harrison do a show that's extreme as hell.

968
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,420
Test the white nationalist water.

969
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,020
Yeah, let's see if that's a tap market that we can tap.

970
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,980
Is anybody going to punish us for this?

971
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:25,360
Or is it the case that Alex has run out of fucking steam to the point where a bigot like

972
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:30,460
Harrison is taking over, or not taking over the whole thing, but like he has his own show

973
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,580
and he's like, I'm going to speak to you fucking freely, I don't care, who else are you going

974
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,580
to get to host a show?

975
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,100
You need to sell your dumb pills.

976
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,100
That's fair.

977
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:41,700
I don't know, it's outrageous though, like I think that Harrison might be a much bigger

978
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,660
problem than he appears.

979
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:49,080
I mean, Harrison isn't even smart enough to do the dumbest, easiest thing that you can

980
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:54,360
possibly do, which is immediately do what Alex does after saying something that's explicitly

981
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:59,020
white nationalist and say, now you know me, I don't care about white, black, Hispanic

982
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,020
or whatever.

983
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,660
He doesn't even bother to do that cop out.

984
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,660
No.

985
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,660
What an asshole.

986
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,660
Because I think he's speaking.

987
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,660
He's just a white nationalist, yeah.

988
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,660
Speaking freely.

989
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,660
Yeah.

990
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,660
So anyway, now we jump back to inauguration day.

991
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,660
Sure.

992
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,020
Sorry to take that side tour, but I felt like it was important.

993
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,020
It was a good detour.

994
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,020
Does that...

995
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,780
You got to know when the whites are coming.

996
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,940
Well, I mean, I really felt like that was something...

997
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,580
That's my argument for white genocide.

998
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,060
You got to know when they're coming.

999
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:31,620
I felt like that was something that was behind the clip of him talking about your children

1000
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,620
will be hated minorities.

1001
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1002
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,620
Look how that is.

1003
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:38,540
I was not wrong to suspect that this is the kind of thing you talk about.

1004
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,540
Yeah.

1005
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,300
And now we get back to the 20th and this is a scary thought.

1006
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,460
So we know how fake the news is.

1007
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,340
Imagine how fake history is.

1008
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,700
You see this play out in real time.

1009
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:55,020
We see the truth with our own eyes and then we hear the lies about it.

1010
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,180
We see the truth of the past.

1011
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,500
Head back to us.

1012
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,580
Imagine how false history is.

1013
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,100
That is so scary.

1014
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:06,780
That mentality is so scary, especially considering a week ago we had Alex presenting a completely

1015
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,980
false version of Hitler's rise to power.

1016
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:15,940
InfoWars does so much historical revisionism surrounding very serious issues.

1017
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:21,860
You know, hey, we've created an alternative reality for us to live in and we say that

1018
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,860
everybody else is lying.

1019
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,140
Can you imagine how much more lies are going on with history?

1020
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,140
Yeah.

1021
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,140
It's fucked up.

1022
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,820
You're, you're basically, yeah, you're, you're absolutely right.

1023
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:35,220
Like, hey, we've defeated reality in the present.

1024
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,900
Our only way to go now is the past unless somebody invents a time machine.

1025
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:43,700
Well, I think, I think that that's been the project of a lot of fascist types for a long

1026
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,700
time.

1027
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1028
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,900
You know, neo-Nazis have revisionist ideas about what happened in Germany.

1029
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:55,460
Well, I mean, when you allow the Texas board to have any influence over textbooks whatsoever,

1030
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,340
you're not going to get a real history.

1031
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,700
Alex has revisionist ideas about the Confederacy.

1032
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,180
It's not, it's not too surprising.

1033
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:06,380
How many people learned that it was about states' rights in school?

1034
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,380
How many people?

1035
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,380
Probably Alex.

1036
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:14,560
Millions, millions, maybe the entire country in our elementary school system that is designed

1037
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,540
to teach you history and for you to take into the world, they lied straight to your face

1038
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,540
when you were seven.

1039
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,760
What are you going to do?

1040
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:30,020
So Harrison is, is going on here on inauguration day and he's talking about how the, the mainstream

1041
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:37,140
media, the MSM, the globalists, they've taken the people who believe that Trump won and

1042
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:43,060
they've turned the idea that Trump won into the big lie that they're being misrepresented.

1043
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,760
This is just nonsense.

1044
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,860
This they're calling the big lie and they're saying, even pointing this out or people trying

1045
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:54,260
to represent their constituents who are all calling out saying, this was fake, please,

1046
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,680
for the love of God, you're supposed to be our representative.

1047
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,560
Please say something, please stop this deal from going forward.

1048
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:04,700
They are now being portrayed as racist, fascist, implementing a new Jim Crow.

1049
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,820
I mean, this is absurd.

1050
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:12,960
This is beyond anything we've ever experienced before and at the heart of it.

1051
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,620
This is a war against white people.

1052
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,780
That's what you have to realize.

1053
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,100
They are making a concerted effort now.

1054
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,100
They're out in the open.

1055
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,100
They're not hiding it.

1056
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,540
They're not couching it in any friendly phrases.

1057
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:30,700
They're saying white people are bad, must be destroyed, must be rooted out, must be

1058
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:35,240
ripped out by the roots, must be eliminated from this country.

1059
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,860
So at this point I got a little bit worried.

1060
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,780
I was like, I'm listening to, I was just checking in on inauguration day.

1061
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:44,900
I got a little sniff of something that I thought maybe Harrison was a bigot.

1062
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,900
I went and watched his stop white genocide video.

1063
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,860
Now I come back to the inauguration, he's talking about the war on whites.

1064
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,860
The war on white people.

1065
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:51,860
Oh no.

1066
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,100
I was like, what did I get into?

1067
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,780
They've declared war on the whites.

1068
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,900
It wasn't that white nationalists literally tried to overthrow the country.

1069
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,860
They've declared war on all white people.

1070
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:08,460
I was like, okay, when I sat down to prepare this episode, I was thinking, all right, I'll

1071
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,740
breeze through Harrison's dumb ass and then we'll get to Alex and that'll be when the

1072
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:13,980
episode really begins.

1073
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:18,980
No, this is going to be half the episode probably talking about Harrison Smith.

1074
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:19,980
Brutal.

1075
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,980
Yeah.

1076
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,980
Brutal.

1077
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,980
Terrible.

1078
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,540
He is real biggity.

1079
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:31,540
Let's just stop for one second and remember that the evil globalists are now declaring

1080
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,820
war on white people.

1081
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:33,940
According to Harrison.

1082
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:39,620
Even though last year, only a few months ago, their plan B was murdering everyone.

1083
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,620
Sure.

1084
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,420
Well, plan B is not to be remembered now because it's not the profitable angle.

1085
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:45,420
Well, that's fair.

1086
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,420
Yeah.

1087
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,660
We have, uh, we've gotten a new sales flow chart.

1088
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,660
Now it's white.

1089
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,960
Whiteness only.

1090
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,960
Certainly for Harrison's show.

1091
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,960
Yeah.

1092
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,540
So he also wishes that Trump was a little bit more authoritarian and he's talking about

1093
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:03,420
this in the framework of sort of optics differences between Trump's inauguration and Biden's.

1094
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,260
Um, he's being really dumb here.

1095
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:10,340
When Donald Trump won duly elected, nobody expected it, but he did it.

1096
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,340
He pulled it out.

1097
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,460
He pulled, he pulled through.

1098
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:18,580
He got elected president of the United States and everybody was very, very concerned about

1099
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,580
authoritarianism.

1100
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:29,500
I'll tell you if in 2016, before the Trump inauguration, DC was filled with 65,000 troops

1101
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:37,940
and there were people going on TV who were heads of the army saying, we need to have

1102
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:43,260
purity tests and we need to kick out anybody that doesn't adhere to our view of what it

1103
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:48,540
is to be an American and reality entire national mall was covered in flags because they weren't

1104
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:51,040
letting any people come.

1105
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,460
And the entire city of Washington, DC was locked down like the green zone in Iraq.

1106
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,980
You tried to throw a little freaked out.

1107
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:02,400
I would have thought, Oh God, maybe this is the authoritarianism they're warning about.

1108
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,900
Of course that didn't happen.

1109
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:04,900
None of that happened.

1110
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,900
Nothing.

1111
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,100
Just authoritarian in the slightest.

1112
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,660
I wish it had been more so.

1113
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:14,200
I wish he had been more like the, the monster that they portrayed him as.

1114
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:19,620
Maybe we wouldn't be in the situation we're in now if he'd actually used an iron fist.

1115
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,840
Ah, what a shock.

1116
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,340
Someone who works at info wars revealing that they wish Trump was a dictator.

1117
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:29,540
If they think history is a lie, these motherfuckers can't remember two weeks ago clearly.

1118
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,540
No, I know.

1119
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:34,220
That was the thing that really bothered me about that, like, uh, that description of

1120
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,220
the inauguration.

1121
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,540
It was like, you're pretending there's no cause to these effects.

1122
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:48,560
Did, did I, Dan, now I could be wrong, but I don't remember in January of 2017, uh, liberals

1123
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,860
overthrowing the Capitol.

1124
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,120
No, that didn't happen.

1125
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,120
That didn't happen?

1126
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,220
And that kind of affects this inauguration.

1127
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:59,860
Also, the smaller crowds pandemic, the flags also about a memorial to those lost.

1128
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,860
Representative to the pandemic.

1129
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:05,260
They keep bringing up the flags as if it's just like a way to fill space because people

1130
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,260
couldn't be there.

1131
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,300
It's like, no, there was a symbolic meaning to that.

1132
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:13,580
Yeah, it wasn't that we committed, uh, oh, well, I mean, some could argue even a genocide

1133
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,580
with intent to kill the poor.

1134
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,260
If you go back and look at Kushner's fucking statements.

1135
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:23,680
And then, uh, in terms of like, uh, the screening of service members, that is also because some

1136
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,580
were involved in storming the Capitol.

1137
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,580
There was that.

1138
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,580
Um, yeah.

1139
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:32,880
So I mean, like, I think that when you have a situation like that, um, it's important

1140
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:39,420
not to allow yourself to give in to the impulse to go on a McCarthy-esque witch hunt.

1141
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:44,280
But at the same time, the conversation about extremism and extremists infiltrating law

1142
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:50,660
enforcement and, uh, uh, the, the services like that is something that is long overdue.

1143
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:55,120
Uh, but you have to retain your, your, uh, sensibility about it.

1144
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,260
You can't just be like, oh, this guy donates to the Heritage Foundation.

1145
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,260
Yeah.

1146
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,260
Therefore he's an extremist.

1147
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,260
No.

1148
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,260
You can't go that far.

1149
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,260
No.

1150
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,260
You need to be careful.

1151
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,660
But that's a conversation that you should never pretend you can have with someone like

1152
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,660
Harrison Smith.

1153
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:15,380
Yeah, no, it wasn't like in 1863 Lincoln was like, well, of course I need to have a confederate

1154
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,460
in my secret service detail.

1155
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,760
Why wouldn't I have a confederate soldier in my secret service team?

1156
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:26,360
It would be discrimination for me to get rid of this literal enemy of the United States

1157
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,200
from my secret service detail.

1158
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,320
And then I would also like to say, um, just in the same way that like the screening of

1159
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,600
things is like a very sensible, reasonable thing.

1160
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:39,840
You can understand why it would happen, but you have to resist going too far with it.

1161
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,840
Of course.

1162
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:46,960
I would say that the, like the presence of security forces in, uh, and around the inauguration

1163
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,600
is something that I don't like to see.

1164
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,600
It's not good.

1165
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,600
No, it's fucked up.

1166
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,600
Yeah.

1167
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,600
I can be against that.

1168
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,880
And at the same time, be enough of an adult to understand why it's happening.

1169
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,880
Yeah.

1170
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,880
Yeah.

1171
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,360
I don't have to, I can, I can be against the militarization of the police and still

1172
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,200
recognize, hey, some people fucking stormed the Capitol a week, two weeks ago.

1173
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,480
And I understand that you're like, oh no, there were so many troops there.

1174
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,480
I understand that.

1175
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,240
But you need to understand there were so many there because they're worried.

1176
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:17,400
There are a lot of you wanting to overthrow the United States government.

1177
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:24,200
And there were people online, uh, impotently or sincerely discussing plans for other, uh,

1178
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,200
things.

1179
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:30,680
You know, and I do think that probably if it was less or if it was more than two weeks

1180
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:35,120
in between, there might've been a better solution that would have been available.

1181
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,680
But it's a really, it's a really time crunch kind of situation.

1182
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,160
Well, you know, America, we never overreact to situations.

1183
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,160
Sure.

1184
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,160
Yeah.

1185
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,320
And again, like what I'm saying is those things are valid concerns to have.

1186
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,320
Yeah, absolutely.

1187
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,120
Just not something that you should ever find common cause or ally ship with info warriors

1188
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,760
about because they're not sincere.

1189
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,240
And it's your fault that those things happened.

1190
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,240
Well, anyway.

1191
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,240
You are the one who literally said the Capitol has fallen to the Patriots.

1192
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,520
He did, but he pretends that he didn't because he's against it now.

1193
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,520
Sure.

1194
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,520
Fuck off.

1195
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,920
No, you don't get to do this.

1196
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,920
He shouldn't.

1197
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,400
So, um, you may recall that Alex has said that, uh, if the host of the American journal

1198
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,360
doesn't take calls, they will not be hosting it any longer.

1199
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,360
That is true.

1200
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,760
Harrison doesn't take calls immediately, but he does get to some calls and these calls

1201
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,760
are not good.

1202
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,760
Filled with happy people.

1203
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,760
Oh boy.

1204
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,760
Greetings Harrison.

1205
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,400
This is the Renegade Patriot in Ohio.

1206
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,820
I use this calling in because, uh, I've been listening for 11 years in silence, but I prompted

1207
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:41,640
me to make my own YouTube channel that was inspired partly by info wars and by a political

1208
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,960
prisoner named Charles Dyer, Sergeant Charles Dyer, known as July four Patriot on YouTube.

1209
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,700
In case you're curious, Charles Dyer is not a political prisoner in 2012, he was convicted

1210
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:56,040
of sexually abusing his six year old daughter and sentenced to 30 years in jail.

1211
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,600
He's been turned into the hero of the extreme right wing who curiously call everyone they

1212
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:04,160
don't like pedophiles because he was a member of the oath keepers and was the type of extreme

1213
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,720
right wing militia guy that when his house was searched, they found a fucking grenade

1214
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,720
launcher.

1215
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,080
Anyway, it says a whole lot about a fellow when they call into Harrison's show and say

1216
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,640
they were inspired to start a YouTube channel because of info wars and Charles Dyer.

1217
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,160
Yeah, that one, that one solves most problems.

1218
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,560
Now that caller was bad.

1219
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,560
Yeah.

1220
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,560
Not great.

1221
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,560
Yeah.

1222
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,960
Nothing compared to this next caller.

1223
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,160
Oh, that's not good.

1224
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,620
This caller is...

1225
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,620
It can't escalate.

1226
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,620
Oh boy.

1227
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:40,560
After analyzing the top 10 high rank picks for Biden, all 10 of them have a dual citizenship

1228
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,680
in the state of Israel.

1229
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:48,520
So you know, Trump tried his best to get that support from the Israeli lobby and really

1230
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,680
he was basically the best president for Israel ever.

1231
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,440
I mean, that's actually true, yet it didn't even work.

1232
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,960
They don't support him now and they're all, Biden's their man.

1233
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,360
So we've been over this before, but when you hear a right wing dumb dumb like this caller

1234
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:06,300
bring up someone having dual citizenship with Israel, it's an expression of deep antisemitism.

1235
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,700
It goes hand in hand with the Holocaust didn't happen.

1236
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,280
This guy wants to complain that Biden has Jewish people in his cabinet, but he knows

1237
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,360
that that looks bad.

1238
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:19,080
So he tries to couch things, tries to couch that hatred of Jews and language that has

1239
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,120
to do with concerns about dual citizenship.

1240
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:27,000
This is a classic neo-Nazi talking point that the Jewish criminals who they believe run

1241
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,880
the world, they don't care that what they're doing is illegal because their Jewish heritage

1242
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,520
gives them right of return citizenship in Israel.

1243
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,840
So they can just flee there and avoid being held accountable.

1244
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,360
Uh, Dan, I saw Die Hard 2.

1245
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,580
Diplomatic immunity.

1246
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:44,420
This is what's at the core of this caller and what he's expressing here.

1247
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:47,520
And it's been an insidious antisemitic trope for decades.

1248
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,600
Since Die Hard 2.

1249
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,820
This caller, incidentally, is just responding to a meme that went around on Twitter from

1250
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:57,960
an account called Syndrome of a Down, which claimed, quote, all 10 of Biden's high profile

1251
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,640
appointees are Jews.

1252
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,520
That's right, every single one.

1253
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,560
This is accompanied by a screenshot depicting 10 Biden appointees next to Israeli flags,

1254
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,160
which is unsettling.

1255
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,720
This is a really simple game this Nazi is playing where they just cherry pick Jewish

1256
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:15,880
people Biden has appointed to various offices, then assert baselessly that these 10 are the

1257
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:20,320
most high profile appointees, whatever that means, and that it's suspicious that these

1258
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,320
people are Jewish.

1259
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,320
Of course.

1260
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,320
This is transparent.

1261
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,560
And anyone who's calling in to enforce to repeat this talking point is absolutely an

1262
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,560
antisemite until proven otherwise.

1263
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,560
Totally.

1264
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:33,560
Quite a show Harrison is hosting here, just full of white identity based fear, callers

1265
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,560
inspired by patriot pedophiles and potential neo-Nazis.

1266
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,560
Yep.

1267
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,400
Now, Harrison tries to fact check this guy.

1268
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,400
Oh yeah?

1269
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,400
And he finds the meme.

1270
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,400
Oh my God.

1271
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,400
And so he just reads the meme.

1272
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,920
Is Joe Rogan fact checking here?

1273
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,920
Yeah.

1274
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,920
Hell, you're making a lot of good points.

1275
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:53,840
You have, uh, the, the image here that's been going around all 10 of Biden's high profile

1276
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,720
appointees are Jews and dual citizens with Israel.

1277
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,000
You have secretary of the treasury, Janet Yellen, attorney general, Merrick Garland,

1278
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,960
secretary of home real quick there.

1279
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,040
The meme that he's reading off of doesn't say and dual citizens of Israel.

1280
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,400
It just says Jews.

1281
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,400
Yeah.

1282
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,120
Harrison has added that because he realizes don't want to do it.

1283
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,120
Oh boy.

1284
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,120
I'm going to hit that J too hard.

1285
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,160
I have to soften this a little bit.

1286
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,520
Otherwise, otherwise it looks as antisemitic as it is.

1287
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,520
Yeah.

1288
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:25,880
Homeland security, Alejandro Mayorkas, uh, director of national intelligence, Avril Haines,

1289
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:31,080
uh, white house chief of staff, Ron Klain, secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, deputy

1290
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:37,360
secretary of state, Wendy Sherman, secretary of state for political affairs, Victoria Newland,

1291
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,880
the office of science and technology policy, Eric Lander, director of the central intelligence

1292
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,040
agency, David S. Cohen.

1293
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,020
Now call me crazy.

1294
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:50,340
I think the people serving in our government serving in the American government should

1295
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,240
not be dual citizens with another country.

1296
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,760
Am I crazy for thinking, am I an anti-Semite?

1297
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,760
Yes.

1298
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,400
You are super antisemitic.

1299
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,760
That is exactly what you are.

1300
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,400
That's really, really bad when you traffic in dual loyalty tropes about Jewish Americans.

1301
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,560
It's super basic stuff in terms of antisemitism and I can explain one of the reasons why it's

1302
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,540
really obvious.

1303
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,880
Harrison's complaint is that these people are dual citizens in the United States and

1304
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,040
Israel.

1305
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:21,480
Having dual citizenship in this case is defined, defined solely as these people being Jewish.

1306
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:25,160
Insisting the people who have dual citizenship being in government is suspicious or wrong

1307
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,720
is really just a way for these people to say that they think Jewish people shouldn't be

1308
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:33,320
in government without having to say something so obviously antisemitic.

1309
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,680
Harrison isn't an idiot.

1310
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,080
He understands this dynamic fully well.

1311
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:41,000
He's a flagrant bigot who knows that daddy Alex will fire him if he speaks too freely,

1312
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I suspect.

1313
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,720
And so you do stuff like this.

1314
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,600
This is outrageous.

1315
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:51,620
This can't be like, I was aghast at this.

1316
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:54,560
This is not what I expected on inauguration day.

1317
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,360
Out and out white supremacy?

1318
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,360
And yeah, yeah.

1319
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,520
Honestly I kind of was expecting this on inauguration day because you can't say that they're going

1320
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,520
to kill everybody now.

1321
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,840
I expected it before.

1322
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,000
Well we've seen plenty of it before.

1323
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,840
But this is- Not quite.

1324
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,840
Not quite.

1325
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,400
No Jews should be in the government.

1326
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,160
And maybe it's a function of Harrison Smith being like not a great broadcaster.

1327
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,840
That he's being this- Yeah, yeah.

1328
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,840
This transparent about it.

1329
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,320
He doesn't have the chops to be less racist.

1330
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,360
Man, and this caller keeps going.

1331
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,360
Oh.

1332
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,360
Why?

1333
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:32,000
Well remember there was this nice sweet little Jewish lady who came onto Oprah and said that

1334
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,880
within the Jewish community there are people who are not Jewish.

1335
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,140
They're hiding under Judaism but they're not Jews.

1336
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:41,520
They don't follow Moses, they don't follow the Torah, they don't follow the Ten Commandments

1337
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,960
so if you're a Jew and you actually follow the Ten Commandments, you know, you're not

1338
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,960
the problem.

1339
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,960
We're not talking about you.

1340
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:52,520
But there are people who hide behind this Judaism and she openly admitted they are breeding

1341
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:56,560
babies with really obese people who you can't even tell they're pregnant.

1342
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,440
And then they do satanic rituals and when Oprah asked her, why are you doing this?

1343
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,200
She goes, for power.

1344
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,360
Like it was an obvious thing, like you should know.

1345
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,880
So I don't think these people are actually Jews.

1346
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,560
I think they're part of an organization that is satanic that is hiding behind Judaism.

1347
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,880
Wow.

1348
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:18,380
I was listening to this caller go hard on the antisemitism and listening to Harrison

1349
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:22,920
be completely open to it and not shut it down at all and I was thinking, I wonder how long

1350
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,040
it's going to be until we get into blood libel.

1351
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,040
Yeah.

1352
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,040
Turns out not too long.

1353
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,040
Not long at all.

1354
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:33,720
This Oprah segment that the caller is bringing up is from May 1989 and it was a huge embarrassment

1355
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,920
for Oprah.

1356
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,560
What happened is that there was that whole satanic panic going on in America.

1357
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:43,160
The McMartin preschool trial was in its like sixth year and lurid stories of ritualistic

1358
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,960
satanic abuse were widespread, the idea that they were widespread in every neighborhood,

1359
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,120
that was drawing ratings.

1360
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,720
Oprah tried to do an episode of her talk show about ritualistic satanic abuse cases and

1361
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:57,880
one of her guests was a Jewish woman who told all sorts of insane stories about her family

1362
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:02,680
performing ritual murders since the 1700s, that it was prevalent in Jewish families and

1363
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,000
the police knew about it and didn't do anything.

1364
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Huh.

1365
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Oprah had attempted to frame the conversation by introducing the guest as someone who is

1366
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
quote mentally disturbed and under psychiatric care, but I think that's not good enough.

1367
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,400
A better move would not be doing this kind of interview with someone you have to preemptively

1368
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,060
introduce as an unreliable source of information.

1369
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:26,200
Just so everyone knows, I want you to say that this person is not fit to be on TV.

1370
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,200
Good.

1371
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,560
And now we're going to exploit her!

1372
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,560
Exactly!

1373
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,880
In the past it's putting a mentally unstable person in a position where they're being exploited

1374
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,980
for ratings and at worst it was allowing a mentally unstable person to spread deeply

1375
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:39,840
dangerous accusations about a religious community.

1376
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:43,640
Either way, if this had happened nowadays, Oprah's career would have been over.

1377
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,760
No, we would have fucked everybody up.

1378
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,760
Somehow in 1989.

1379
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,760
Ellen was just a dick!

1380
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:53,060
In 1989, you can have this kind of a scandal and granted, you know, I was able to find

1381
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:58,300
a bunch of articles about Oprah meeting with leaders in the Jewish community and apologizing

1382
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:02,680
and responding to criticism, but like, this should never have happened to begin with.

1383
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,680
No, no, no, no, no.

1384
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,000
So producers better have been fired.

1385
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,480
Yeah, it's a good thing that 30 years later we're still hearing about it.

1386
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,480
That's how good it was.

1387
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,560
Well, from Nazi callers on Harrison's Nazi show.

1388
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,840
Yeah, there's that.

1389
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:20,480
This show is absolutely mind-blowing and how offensive it is, this American Journal.

1390
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:26,200
Harrison Smith seems way, way more committed to or just willing to broadcast explicit racism

1391
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,840
and anti-semitism to the audience.

1392
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,840
Yeah.

1393
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:34,880
I was taken aback by how horrible this is.

1394
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:40,000
I would say, I think, I mean, maybe there's just a simple explanation, which is that Harrison

1395
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,680
isn't rich enough to want to protect money more than anybody who's not white.

1396
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:49,040
I can't imagine that he has a more lucrative offer than what he's doing at Infowars.

1397
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,040
Absolutely.

1398
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,840
And I can't imagine Alex pays him anywhere near what David Knight got.

1399
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,840
That's true.

1400
01:02:54,840 --> 01:03:00,280
And I also, I would imagine that if Alex wanted him to curb these behaviors, he would.

1401
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,280
Maybe.

1402
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,480
And then he would get an alias and write a blog.

1403
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,520
Well, that's probably true.

1404
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,120
Start a YouTube channel where he wears a mask and bores everyone with racism.

1405
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,280
That would be linked back to Infowars.com too, yeah.

1406
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,280
Undoubtedly.

1407
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,280
Yeah.

1408
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:20,800
So Harrison takes another call and apparently what needs to happen is, you know how Infowars

1409
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:26,400
is obsessed with the idea that there are no-go zones all over Europe, where the Muslims won't

1410
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,400
let people in?

1411
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,400
Absolutely.

1412
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,320
Well, Harrison believes that they need to make some no-go zones in America, basically.

1413
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,320
Okay.

1414
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:35,400
Well, we're going to move into a very new dynamic.

1415
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:40,080
And I've said it before, I think geographic approximation will suddenly become very important.

1416
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,780
I think you need to find like-minded people that you can be near, that you can protect

1417
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:49,760
each other, that you can actually put up a substantial force in order to prevent the

1418
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:56,440
American forces from coming in and robbing you of the rights that you have as a sovereign

1419
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,440
individual.

1420
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,280
I think, you know, personally, maybe I'm a little biased because I'm from Texas, but

1421
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:04,760
I can't think of a better place to gather patriots and say, everybody who's out there

1422
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:09,520
in America, I know it would suck to have to leave your home and go to a different place,

1423
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,560
but if we stay de-separated, if we stay sort of in these small pockets around and around,

1424
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,640
they'll come one by one and scoop us all up.

1425
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,300
You have to, we have to gather in a single place.

1426
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:20,560
We have to defend that place.

1427
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:27,400
We have to create areas of land that the powers that be cannot break into, cannot get into.

1428
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,200
We need to have our own autonomous zones around the country.

1429
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,600
Okay.

1430
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,740
All I heard was, I thought sundown towns were a great idea and I don't understand why we

1431
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:37,760
ever stopped that.

1432
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,360
Was there something wrong with sundown towns, Dan?

1433
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,360
It's strange.

1434
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,360
Yeah.

1435
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:46,760
This show gets really weird and I lost my taste for it at a certain point.

1436
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:47,760
I have very much.

1437
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:53,440
I had a lot of conversation about getting people to move to Texas to secede.

1438
01:04:53,440 --> 01:05:00,640
He has a South African caller lady who seems to think that apartheid didn't happen, but

1439
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,480
I couldn't make sense of what she was saying and so I don't have any clips of it.

1440
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,040
It was just, it was kind of all over the place.

1441
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:12,760
And so here is how he goes out to break before Alex joins him for a little guest appearance

1442
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,720
on the American Journal.

1443
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,240
This is bleak.

1444
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:20,160
Interesting agencies to review their actions and ensure racial equity.

1445
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,720
Everything's going to be based off this.

1446
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,960
He's talking about like some of Biden's policy initiatives.

1447
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,040
Yeah, I'm seeing it.

1448
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:29,280
Racial equity, which basically means robbing white people and rewarding non-white people

1449
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:32,760
in order to basically do a genocide on white people.

1450
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,360
I mean, it's not, let's not mince words here.

1451
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:39,520
Everything that the Chinese are doing to the Uyghur Muslims are exactly what the plans

1452
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,000
are for the Biden administration for white people.

1453
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,520
I mean, when you say it's a good thing and we're making policy in order to decrease the

1454
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:52,160
share of the population that white people hold, that is a genocidal policy.

1455
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,640
Let's again, let's not mince words, let's not pretend like this is something that it

1456
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:56,640
isn't.

1457
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:02,240
This is a genocidal policy to essentially eradicate anybody from standing up against

1458
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,240
these people.

1459
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:09,400
And it all has to do with the fact that white people historically have been the only civilization

1460
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:15,120
as far as the world is concerned that actually puts in freedom into their governmental organizations.

1461
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:19,640
And that is mostly based on the fact that Christianity is a European religion.

1462
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,420
So third hour begins on the other side.

1463
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,800
So now we've shifted into white supremacy from white nationalism.

1464
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,280
We're straight up there.

1465
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,280
No arguing that.

1466
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,280
You know, I will say this.

1467
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,920
This show is nuts.

1468
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,360
I will say this.

1469
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:35,560
I think Harrison has absolutely succeeded.

1470
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:39,160
When he said earlier, he is going to lay out the case for white genocide.

1471
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,160
I get what you're saying.

1472
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,160
He nailed it.

1473
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,160
Calm down.

1474
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,160
He nailed it.

1475
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,160
Calm down.

1476
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,160
Oh, he nailed it.

1477
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,160
Your satire.

1478
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,160
Your joke.

1479
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,160
Yeah.

1480
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:56,120
So Alex comes on to stop by the Journal and I was weirded out by this, actually.

1481
01:06:56,120 --> 01:07:00,000
You're watching American Journal on Infowars.com, I'm Harrison Smith joined by Alex Jones.

1482
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Welcome, Alex.

1483
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,960
Yeah, and I'm just popping in for a segment here to invite all your wonderful viewers

1484
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:10,080
to have our live coverage coming up here in just about 39 minutes of the installation

1485
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,840
of the inauguration of the communist Chinese spy, Biden.

1486
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:17,320
Why is Alex coming to promote his show on Harrison's show?

1487
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:21,040
Because the white nationalists are tuning in, Dan.

1488
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:27,000
Do get the sense that maybe Alex sees a different audience.

1489
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,760
Maybe Harrison is appealing to another audience that might not stick around to watch Alex.

1490
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,760
Yes.

1491
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:36,600
He's coming in to promote himself to them, because otherwise the only place you're watching

1492
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:42,580
the American fucking Journal is on Infowars' streams, which would automatically start playing

1493
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,220
Alex's show afterwards.

1494
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:48,500
I would like to welcome all the Red Ice listeners to Harrison Smith's show, and I just want

1495
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:51,240
to let you know that the Alex Jones show is up next.

1496
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:52,240
Yeah.

1497
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:56,600
So Alex thinks that people think he's soft, because he accepts that Trump is going to

1498
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,600
be leaving office.

1499
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,600
Sure.

1500
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:03,000
I've seen him on Infowars.com saying, how dare you say he would leave today.

1501
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
You're a traitor.

1502
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,160
You're agreeing with CNN as if as I magically said he was going to stay.

1503
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,680
He was going to stay.

1504
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,520
We literally talked to the president.

1505
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,520
Okay.

1506
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,520
I talked to two of his lawyers.

1507
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:18,520
I talked to somebody else very close to him the last few days, and he was going.

1508
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:23,320
As soon as he capitulated the day after January 6th, it was over.

1509
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,320
What happened January 6th?

1510
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,520
They sent in provocateurs.

1511
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:32,720
They sabotaged our operation, but that was a last-ditch Hail Mary to begin with.

1512
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,140
I was listening to that, and I was like, it's 10 a.m.

1513
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:36,140
You sound fucked up.

1514
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,640
He sounds not good.

1515
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,640
Yeah.

1516
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,640
Yeah, yeah.

1517
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,760
But I also was like, he probably just woke up or something.

1518
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,880
You know, I wasn't sure, but I was worried.

1519
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:45,880
I was worried.

1520
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:49,280
The way he's talking is not normal Alex Jones.

1521
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,600
I would give him a hangover and a hair of the dog.

1522
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,440
I think that's what I'm hearing.

1523
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:56,440
That's kind of what I thought, but then he explains what's going on.

1524
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,440
OK.

1525
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,600
And so they don't want a big mainline debate about this.

1526
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,520
They want to have it be esoteric.

1527
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:06,320
They created a secret society to make people think that we're in the inside group with

1528
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:11,840
military intelligence and that everything was going to be fine, so people can be pacified.

1529
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,800
I'm going to move on from Q at that point.

1530
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:19,280
We'll talk about what Biden's going to do, how they're going to strangle this country

1531
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,720
during inauguration and afterwards.

1532
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,920
I do not have COVID or anything.

1533
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:29,680
I had some dental work done and got a little infection back on one of my tonsils have been

1534
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,680
to see the doctor.

1535
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,680
It's localized.

1536
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,680
It's fine.

1537
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:35,600
About a dime size rattle back in my throat, but I'm fine.

1538
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,600
I never take painkillers.

1539
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,000
I'm actually on painkillers right now.

1540
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Oh, OK.

1541
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
So you're on painkillers.

1542
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
All right.

1543
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Cool.

1544
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Good time to be at work.

1545
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
All right.

1546
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I'm just going to go.

1547
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I'm just going to get some dental surgery.

1548
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,160
I talk for a living, dental surgery, the morning of Biden's inauguration and coming to work

1549
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,160
high on painkillers.

1550
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,160
That's what I got to do.

1551
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,880
That's what you got to do, Dan.

1552
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:56,880
Wow.

1553
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:57,880
Inauguration.

1554
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:58,880
The show must go on.

1555
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,720
I will say that I don't think it affects him nearly as much as it could have.

1556
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:03,720
Yeah.

1557
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,960
So it's not like he's fucked up.

1558
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,040
You could just hear like there's a there's something different in his delivery and that

1559
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,040
explains it.

1560
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,040
He had some dental work done.

1561
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,040
He's on some painkillers.

1562
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,040
Yeah.

1563
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:21,400
So I think that they thought that Biden would be giving his getting sworn in on Alex's show.

1564
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,400
Right.

1565
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,400
But that doesn't work out.

1566
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,400
No.

1567
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:30,280
And you know, we get all of that while Harrison is still hosting and Alex has left to prepare

1568
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,280
for his show.

1569
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,280
Yeah.

1570
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,280
And so Harrison tries.

1571
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:34,280
God bless him.

1572
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,280
He tries.

1573
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,520
Joe Biden probably wondering where the hell he is right now.

1574
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:45,200
Hey, there's a baby that knows what's going on.

1575
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,800
Hell yeah.

1576
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,360
That's great work, Harrison.

1577
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,640
That's great work.

1578
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:56,480
So Harrison just plays Biden's acceptance speech and he interrupts kind of limitedly

1579
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:00,840
because I think that he's just hoping that Biden will make a big flub and then respond

1580
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,840
to.

1581
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,840
Yeah.

1582
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,880
The whole narrative about Biden on Infowars is that he's senile and he can't form sentences.

1583
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,680
So honestly, I think this is a bad strategy.

1584
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:12,360
They're literally airing evidence that he can speak and make sentences, essentially

1585
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,880
debunking one of their big talking points.

1586
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,720
And that is how the journal wraps up.

1587
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:18,720
Yeah.

1588
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,720
The book.

1589
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:23,760
I assume he's a big enough man to apologize for saying that Joe Biden is not.

1590
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,760
Nope.

1591
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:25,760
He's not?

1592
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:26,760
They just sort of pretend that they never said that.

1593
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,960
Much like Harrison pretending that he didn't say the capital's fallen to the Patriots.

1594
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:30,960
Weird.

1595
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:31,960
Yeah.

1596
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:37,080
So Alex comes in and he knows what to do a little bit better than Harrison.

1597
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:40,400
Harrison just lets Biden talk for long stretches.

1598
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,400
Sure.

1599
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,320
Alex tries to mystery science theater that shit.

1600
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,320
Hell yeah.

1601
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:52,600
A few centuries ago, St. Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude

1602
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:59,320
defined by the common objects of their love, defined by the common objects of their love.

1603
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:02,560
What are the common objects we as Americans love?

1604
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,560
Children, you want to molest.

1605
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,600
Define us as Americans.

1606
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:12,800
I think we know opportunity, world government, security, liberty, the population, dignity,

1607
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,680
and honor.

1608
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,040
And yes, the truth.

1609
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,720
So yeah, that's, that's what you come to expect for watching a speech on Infowars.

1610
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,720
Yeah.

1611
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:26,300
You know, for somebody who thinks that Biden is senile, he got his speech patterns pretty

1612
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,600
well down.

1613
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:32,520
Uh, Alex knows when to jump in real quick about how much time he has.

1614
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,080
It seems like he, yeah.

1615
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:39,680
So Biden, in his speech, he proposes that his first act will be a moment of silence

1616
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,440
for the Americans lost to COVID.

1617
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:43,680
How does Alex take that?

1618
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:48,440
Well, it's interesting because we know that from listening to his show, he often has long

1619
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,960
stretches of dead air.

1620
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:50,960
Yeah.

1621
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,400
So a moment of silence should be no big deal.

1622
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,400
Takes nothing.

1623
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,400
Should be no big deal.

1624
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,400
It's a moment.

1625
01:12:55,400 --> 01:13:02,280
In my first act as president, I'd like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer.

1626
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:09,560
Remember all those who we lost in this past year to the pandemic, those 400,000.

1627
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,880
Most of which died of something else, husband's wife, son's daughters that came out of the

1628
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:19,200
Wuhan lab that your buddies, Obama and Fauci and Gates cooked up for becoming the people

1629
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,200
and the Democrat States.

1630
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:24,400
When you ship COVID patients into the nursing homes and kill people, I ask you, let's have

1631
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:34,000
a moment of silence for by the Democrats in the UN and the shy comms murdered.

1632
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
And my most silencer.

1633
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:41,560
We can't do that on our radio stations have silence once and it'll send everybody into

1634
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:42,560
a panic.

1635
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,560
Having a moment of silence.

1636
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:49,360
Alex pretends that he can't accept this moment of silence because of radio restrictions.

1637
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,160
That's such nonsense.

1638
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:55,800
He just has to interrupt the moment of silence to like not allow it to air.

1639
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:00,560
I would bet that he has like some spiritual explanation for it in his head.

1640
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:05,840
Like he, I can't allow, I can't allow Biden to have a spiritual moment on info war.

1641
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,840
Absolutely not.

1642
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:07,840
Yeah.

1643
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:08,840
That's really weird.

1644
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,700
He has to, he can't, he can't let it happen.

1645
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:16,240
So this next clip is maybe the only, uh, real moment where, uh, on Alex's show itself where

1646
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:20,320
I was like, Oh, those pills might be affecting you.

1647
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:24,000
Pass along a new and better world to our children.

1648
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,320
I believe we must, I'm sure you do as well.

1649
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,600
I believe we will.

1650
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:33,960
And when we do, we'll write the next great chapter in the history of the United States

1651
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:34,960
of America.

1652
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:35,960
A story.

1653
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:42,440
It might sound something like a song that means a lot to me.

1654
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:45,040
It's called American anthem.

1655
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:53,400
And there there's one verse that stands out, at least for me, like this work and prayers

1656
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:57,280
of century have brought us to this day.

1657
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,440
What shall be our legacy?

1658
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,040
What will our children say?

1659
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:10,360
Let me know in my heart, when my days are through America, America, I gave my best to

1660
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,160
you.

1661
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:15,480
Let's add, let's us add our own work and prayers.

1662
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:18,760
So this is the front man, all they dismantle the country.

1663
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:22,640
All they teach America shouldn't exist while they pull down our statues.

1664
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,500
Then when our days are through while they burn down cities and our children's children

1665
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,500
will save us.

1666
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:32,800
He says that he loves America and he's here to bring us unity.

1667
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,240
They healed all their pundits say they want to put us in reeducation camps.

1668
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,240
Yikes.

1669
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:40,420
Um, the part where at the beginning where it just seemed like he wasn't making a lot

1670
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:45,400
of sense, the interjections he was making were like, he lost the, he lost the thread.

1671
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:51,980
But he picked it up together to like at least make sense, I guess by the end, although still

1672
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:52,980
messed up.

1673
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:53,980
Yeah.

1674
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:58,400
So Alex had been talking about how they were going to be commercial free because there's

1675
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,760
a lot to cover at the inauguration.

1676
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:06,400
Fourteen minutes into his show, this is what happens.

1677
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,400
But now that's my next question.

1678
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,680
I thought this would go for hours.

1679
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:09,680
Well, it isn't.

1680
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,160
So we are not going to be commercial free, I guess until six o'clock tonight when we

1681
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:17,400
take calls up until 10 PM and have a whole raft of special guests here.

1682
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,800
So Alex had expected this inauguration to go all day.

1683
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,200
He didn't realize it was going to be a ceremony.

1684
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,600
It's real quick.

1685
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,600
Yeah.

1686
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:29,920
He didn't realize that maybe Trump's rambling speeches aren't normal.

1687
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:34,200
The wedding ceremony part of the wedding is usually pretty quick.

1688
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,200
Yeah.

1689
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,200
The reception is what goes on.

1690
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,200
It's the reception that takes a while.

1691
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,200
Yeah.

1692
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,200
A party.

1693
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:42,280
Unless you have maybe someone who's officiating the wedding because of Blowhard.

1694
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,280
Sure.

1695
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,280
That can happen.

1696
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,280
Yes.

1697
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,280
Bet you might be there a while.

1698
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:47,280
Could be.

1699
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:51,560
And I think Alex expected a Blowhard as a president because of last time.

1700
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,000
And 14 minutes in he realizes, uh-oh.

1701
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Oh no.

1702
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Oh no.

1703
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,560
Oh this isn't going to be a rambling nonsense speech that I can...

1704
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,560
I have got.

1705
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,960
I have no commercial breaks.

1706
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:03,960
Not good.

1707
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,360
Let's get those commercial breaks back.

1708
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,280
Guys, I don't have anything to say.

1709
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,640
I am not doing this commercial free.

1710
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,640
Yeah.

1711
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:15,080
When he gave me 14 minutes of content that even listening to it I had a hard time riffing

1712
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,080
over.

1713
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,080
Yeah.

1714
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,080
Jesus.

1715
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,080
Not good.

1716
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,080
So here's a commercial that Alex goes to.

1717
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,080
Sure.

1718
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:26,400
And I listen to his commercials on Infowars itself for a while because I generally listen

1719
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:31,840
through the feeds that have Genesis Communications commercials on them.

1720
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,880
So here's one of Alex's commercials.

1721
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:34,880
This blew my mind.

1722
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:40,000
The pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to

1723
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,840
redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United

1724
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:48,640
Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally

1725
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:49,840
a chip under your skin.

1726
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:55,880
It's all now completely official, part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and

1727
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:00,600
Klaus Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller

1728
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,880
Foundation, all the rest of them, agenda 21, agenda 2030.

1729
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:04,880
It's here.

1730
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,440
And only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject

1731
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:10,440
it all.

1732
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:16,600
And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, good versus evil, and stopping

1733
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,600
abortion.

1734
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,600
What?

1735
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:19,600
What's going on here?

1736
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,600
What is happening?

1737
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,600
This is a commercial?

1738
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,000
Am I supposed to watch this show or?

1739
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,360
The musical cues are sophomoric, they're amateurish.

1740
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,360
Love it.

1741
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,320
Yeah, I don't know what's going on here.

1742
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,240
Also, I don't know what he's talking about.

1743
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:43,560
I think this is old because the pope, in his Easter letter last year, discussed UBI.

1744
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:47,320
And maybe the world is approaching a point where universal basic income is something

1745
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,720
we should be considering.

1746
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:53,040
I couldn't find, I don't know if he's doubled down on that, but that was like a big story

1747
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,040
in April.

1748
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:55,040
Sure.

1749
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,040
Yeah.

1750
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,040
I don't know.

1751
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:02,000
I just thought that like, I thought the music, it's all like really dark and like music and

1752
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,200
then at the end like.

1753
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:07,800
Is that a commercial so much or just an interstitial?

1754
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,940
Do you think there's a product that he's selling?

1755
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:11,600
That's what I'm confused about.

1756
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,520
Am I just supposed to listen to more Info Wars because UBI might be coming?

1757
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,520
I don't know.

1758
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,520
I can't actually remember.

1759
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:22,440
I was so caught off guard by that left turn to like, you have to stop abortion.

1760
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,560
Yeah, that one threw me.

1761
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:24,560
I was like.

1762
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,360
I forgot the previous part of the commercial.

1763
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:32,320
It might have ended up in like a bodies commercial or something, but I don't know.

1764
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:38,160
Anyway, we get back to Alex's coverage of the inauguration, which is now over 15 minutes

1765
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,160
into a show.

1766
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,160
Yeah.

1767
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,160
Yeah.

1768
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,160
Trouble.

1769
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:43,160
And so he's got to do what he does.

1770
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,360
I assume he didn't listen to the poets.

1771
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,360
No.

1772
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,360
No.

1773
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,840
He didn't do anything else except for.

1774
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:48,840
Yeah.

1775
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:55,680
I mean, maybe in the evening coverage, they went over the party aspect, but oh, no, they

1776
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,920
also they complained about Lady Gaga a little bit.

1777
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:58,920
Who cares?

1778
01:19:58,920 --> 01:19:59,920
Yeah.

1779
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:00,920
Why not?

1780
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:06,840
Anyway, Alex has a guest on who we've been curious about his whereabouts the FBI might

1781
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,840
be as well.

1782
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:08,840
Okay, story.

1783
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:09,840
I know you're on the road.

1784
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,480
I appreciate you popping on on short notice.

1785
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:14,760
Obviously, I want to get your take on what's happened.

1786
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:18,080
How people that were delusional about Trump being invincible, how they're going to handle

1787
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,080
it.

1788
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,440
But the big issue, they're clearly saying domestic terrorism is here.

1789
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,360
They're clearly preparing to wind up for rock and tour groups.

1790
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,360
You're a domestic terrorist.

1791
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,680
You are for the American people.

1792
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:32,160
Stuart Rhodes, founder of the Oath Keepers.

1793
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,160
They're saying.

1794
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,520
Been wondering what he's up to.

1795
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:35,520
Yeah.

1796
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,520
What's his lie going to be?

1797
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:37,520
Ha ha.

1798
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,520
Interesting.

1799
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,560
Alex doesn't start with, Hey, I haven't seen you since the six.

1800
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,560
How was the six?

1801
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:42,560
Yeah.

1802
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:43,560
Do you have a good time?

1803
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,560
What happened?

1804
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,560
What happened?

1805
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,560
Hey, Stuart Rhodes.

1806
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,560
You're on the road.

1807
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,760
I am definitely not saying you're on the run.

1808
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:50,760
Yeah, definitely.

1809
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:51,760
Wouldn't say that.

1810
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,760
I'm not.

1811
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,880
I'm not saying that he's wanted or anything, but he's a fucked up dude.

1812
01:20:55,880 --> 01:21:01,640
Anyway, he is disappointed in Trump in very similar ways that Harrison was.

1813
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:02,840
Everybody sees right through it.

1814
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,200
These are not the president and vice president.

1815
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:08,800
These are Chai Comm agents, Stuart Rhodes of OathKeepers.org.

1816
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:09,800
Your view on all this.

1817
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:14,600
Well, I think what we have to realize is that, you know, Trump actually failed.

1818
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:20,080
He, um, this is unpopular, but I consider it a dereliction of duty and frankly, cowards

1819
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,080
in the face of the enemy.

1820
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,080
I'll be blunt.

1821
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:26,040
You know, we were calling for him to use the insurrection act all through the summer.

1822
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:29,760
Um, he did not do it and he brought him to the last moment.

1823
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,760
He could have done it.

1824
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,760
Yeah.

1825
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:37,940
You sound, I mean, I, I, his, his response is like as expected as it, you could, it could

1826
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:39,560
be for someone like Stuart Rhodes.

1827
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:40,560
He's disappointed.

1828
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,560
Yeah.

1829
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:44,760
Cause he has been very clearly calling for Trump.

1830
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:49,160
We wanted to overthrow the government and institute a theocracy.

1831
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:53,880
He's straight up been on Info Wars talking about how Trump needs to deputize him and

1832
01:21:53,880 --> 01:22:00,200
all of his buddies, the militias, call them up to restore order in the country.

1833
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,200
Yeah.

1834
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,200
Yeah.

1835
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,200
He, of course he's disappointed.

1836
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,200
He was really excited.

1837
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:08,080
This was as close as he was probably ever going to get to a president being like, yep,

1838
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,480
you guys are my army now.

1839
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:10,480
Yup.

1840
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,480
Yup.

1841
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:15,980
That's about as a, yeah, he wanted a new Confederacy and he almost got it and now he's sad and

1842
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:22,880
I assume Alex texted him being like, Hey, the line is it wasn't you guys on purpose.

1843
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,920
And he was like, but I want to tell people that we should do it again.

1844
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,840
Well he does have, he has an interesting take on what happened on the six and we'll get

1845
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,260
to that in a little bit, but Alex certainly doesn't want to start with, yeah, he wants

1846
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:38,840
to start with Biden is a fake leader and because he's a fake leader, Stuart knows cause he's

1847
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,680
a constitutional scholar.

1848
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,600
He went to Yale.

1849
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,520
Can you imagine how many lies are in history Dan?

1850
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:47,520
Many.

1851
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:52,200
So Stuart, based on the constitution, he's just like, fuck it, we don't have to follow

1852
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,200
laws now.

1853
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:57,160
I'll get plenty of hate mail for saying that and all kinds of people saying, you know,

1854
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:00,840
all the same excuses we've always heard, but he was surrounded by bad people.

1855
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,840
Whose fault was that?

1856
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:02,840
It's his own fault.

1857
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,560
And he's still a commander in chief or he was the commander in chief.

1858
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:08,360
He had a duty and responsibility to step up, but he failed to do that.

1859
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:12,880
He allowed a Chi-Con puppet into the White House and I think we now need to just declare

1860
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:17,120
that to be illegitimate and refuse to comply with anything that comes out of his mouth.

1861
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:22,320
Anything he signs, anything passed as so-called legislation, label it pretend legislation

1862
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,880
like the founding fathers did.

1863
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:26,560
Ha ha, rules are pretend now.

1864
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,560
Sweet.

1865
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:28,560
Okay.

1866
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,560
All right.

1867
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:32,020
I got three Supreme Court justices who don't count anymore.

1868
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:33,180
That's how we're going to do this.

1869
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:34,180
That's how this rule works.

1870
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:35,760
This is not functional.

1871
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,520
I get to choose who I think is the government.

1872
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:39,520
Yeah.

1873
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,520
Yeah.

1874
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:44,400
This is not a way for a cohesive society to work.

1875
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:48,480
And I mean, it makes sense because that's not their goal.

1876
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:52,020
Their goal is not to have a coherent and cohesive society.

1877
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:53,640
It's time to declare independence.

1878
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:54,640
Great.

1879
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,240
But he was not duly elected.

1880
01:23:56,240 --> 01:24:00,200
It's just amazing that Trump will let the election be stolen out from under him and

1881
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,860
then let our country be stolen like this, our government.

1882
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:08,000
So we have to now prepare to walk the path of the founding fathers, where your independence

1883
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,160
from that illegitimate regime.

1884
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:14,400
We still defend the constitution, but they're the ones that are the Ursipers and the violators.

1885
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,400
And you-

1886
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,400
I'm sorry.

1887
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,400
And then get strong in your communities.

1888
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,920
You need to be raising local militias in your towns and counties.

1889
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:24,320
And like the founders did, you need to then nullify, refuse to comply, and when they come

1890
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,320
for you, you defend yourselves.

1891
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,320
But you got to do it together.

1892
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,320
Okay.

1893
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,320
Okay.

1894
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:31,800
So commit crimes and kill cops when they try and arrest you.

1895
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:32,800
I guess.

1896
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,120
I think they're pretend laws.

1897
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,120
I...

1898
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,120
Man.

1899
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:37,120
Oh boy.

1900
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,120
I'm gonna-

1901
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,120
What?

1902
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,280
What pretend laws?

1903
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,280
By this point, I'm-

1904
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,280
What pretend laws?

1905
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:46,320
I would like to know specifically which ones are pretend and which ones are not pretend.

1906
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:51,480
Anything that has Biden's signature on it, his Hancock on it.

1907
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:52,480
Okay.

1908
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,480
That's fake.

1909
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:54,480
All right.

1910
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,480
Look.

1911
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:56,480
Sure.

1912
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:00,600
I can't say enough how stressed out I was when I was listening to this because I got

1913
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:06,280
really caught with a left hook out of nowhere by Harrison's overt racism and anti-Semitism.

1914
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:08,440
I was surprised by the white nationalism, yeah.

1915
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:13,680
That made going through his shit much more of a slog than I expected, and it made it

1916
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,240
like...

1917
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,240
It was taxing.

1918
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:21,640
And then at the same time, it filled me with all kinds of thoughts about like, all right,

1919
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:25,160
I guess the morning show on Info Wars now is just like...

1920
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:26,160
White nationalist happy hour.

1921
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,160
Speak freely.

1922
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1923
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:29,160
Speak freely big at time.

1924
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,160
Yeah.

1925
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:33,600
And that seemed like a bad direction for things to be going.

1926
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:38,200
Then you get into Info Wars itself, like Alex's show, and you got Stuart Rhodes coming in

1927
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:42,860
and it's just like frank discussion about like, the government isn't real.

1928
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:43,860
We need to secede.

1929
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:44,860
Yeah.

1930
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:45,860
Yeah.

1931
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:49,920
And this is doubling into the talk on Harrison's show about creating these enclaves where you

1932
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,000
can protect yourself from the America.

1933
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,800
Sundown towns are great.

1934
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:56,120
It's fucked up.

1935
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:59,560
Don't they already have white nationalist compounds in the Pacific Northwest?

1936
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:03,000
Like entire cities that are like, no, it's whites only here.

1937
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,440
And everybody's just like, it's the Pacific Northwest.

1938
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,560
I guess you guys do that.

1939
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:13,240
I don't know enough to know for sure, but I believe I've heard, at least unofficially

1940
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:16,640
there are some places that have that character.

1941
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:20,600
So one thing that Stuart is clear on is that he's gotten the memo.

1942
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:21,600
Sure.

1943
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,600
We got a shit on Q people.

1944
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,600
Right.

1945
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,400
But the Q people, I mean, only silver lining in all this is maybe the Q people will finally

1946
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:32,880
shut up because all they did the entire time, even up until last night, because, Oh no,

1947
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,040
the trips were there to arrest the bad guys.

1948
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,400
That's delusional nonsense.

1949
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:42,920
Q was an absolute psyop and well done one, what they call a lullaby to get you all to

1950
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:46,800
be lulled into a false sense of security and, and just be asleep.

1951
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,440
That's what happened for four years.

1952
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:53,120
You had people sitting on their hands, doing nothing, waiting, saying, trust the plan,

1953
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,860
waiting for this miraculous day that never came.

1954
01:26:55,860 --> 01:27:01,240
It was a masterful, uh, sign up, but now you're going to wake up, smell the coffee and realize

1955
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,400
now you got to do it the hard way.

1956
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,400
You got to do it the same way.

1957
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:07,200
The founding fathers did, you know, who else was sitting on their hands, doing nothing

1958
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:12,700
for a long time, who people like Alex and Stuart Rhodes, like, you know, these people

1959
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:17,400
who thought that they had something that they could gain from Q Anon until it got to a point

1960
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:20,700
where they realized, Nope, I can't gain anything from this.

1961
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:24,880
And now they sound like people, uh, who we are associated with.

1962
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,760
Like all of a sudden they're pretending that people who have maybe more left politics,

1963
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:34,560
uh, people like the guys at Q Anon Anonymous haven't been like banging the drum for a long

1964
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:40,800
time talking about the dangers and the misleading nature of Q Anon.

1965
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,100
Like I have no patience for this.

1966
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:48,480
You guys have all just jumped onto this now because you realize, well, that's our stick

1967
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,480
to beat.

1968
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:50,480
That's our scapegoat.

1969
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:56,060
And there's a good chance that we can bring in some of the people, uh, anyone who hasn't

1970
01:27:56,060 --> 01:28:00,680
already decided that Alex Jones is controlled opposition because of Q Anon, maybe we can

1971
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,800
get them into our revenue streams.

1972
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:07,040
Isn't the implication of his argument though, that he wanted more people there on the 6th

1973
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,880
to overthrow the government?

1974
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:19,320
No, because then Biden hadn't been inaugurated.

1975
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:20,880
Well you got me.

1976
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:25,400
No, Stuart doesn't want the overthrow of the government to have happened on the 6th.

1977
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:30,640
What he's saying is that Q people, because they were lulled into a false sense of security,

1978
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:34,800
did not show up on the 6th in order to overthrow the government like he wanted.

1979
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:40,000
I mean, I think that you could read his comments and maybe some of even like Alex's comments

1980
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,560
that way, but I don't think that that's a totally fair reading.

1981
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:48,320
I think it's a possible reading, but I think it's more like the way that they intend it

1982
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:51,800
is more like there's organizing that you could do.

1983
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:56,600
There's information warfare you could engage in that you were lulled into a false sense

1984
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,800
of security about.

1985
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,860
You thought Trump was bulletproof, but there's other things you could, you could have been

1986
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:03,320
banging on doors in Georgia.

1987
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:05,560
I think that that's what they want you to hear.

1988
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:06,560
Yeah.

1989
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,860
Dan, you are fair.

1990
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:11,960
I am very much unfair and I'm telling you right now, he wished there were more people

1991
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:12,960
on the 6th.

1992
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,320
Look, that's the dynamic of the show.

1993
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:20,120
Anyway, speaking of the 6th, Alex finally gets around to asking about that and oh boy.

1994
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,800
Give me your take on what happened to the Capitol.

1995
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,160
I mean, we got set up there bad.

1996
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:29,600
Well, sure, but I think it's, I think it's, I see it like this.

1997
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:34,720
Yes, there were provocateurs that made sure the doors were wide open, but I think it's

1998
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:39,200
important for all of us not to use the rhetoric of the left, condemn everyone that walked

1999
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:44,960
in the Capitol as you know, storming the castle or storming the Capitol and, and, and engaging

2000
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,960
the insurrection.

2001
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:49,040
We should just say, look at the most they were trespassing.

2002
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:53,440
Stuart Rhodes has a lot riding on people believing that people who were at the Capitol were just

2003
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,400
trespassing at worst.

2004
01:29:55,400 --> 01:30:00,680
You see, unlike Antifa, the Oath Keepers are a group that exists and Stuart Rhodes is the

2005
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:01,680
head of it.

2006
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:05,400
They have a website where you can donate to them and everything and they have an online

2007
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,600
store where you can buy official merch.

2008
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:12,100
It's an actual group and it kind of looks bad when three members of the group get arrested

2009
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:16,660
after storming the Capitol and their charging document lays out how they planned for weeks

2010
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:21,040
in advance in order to, in theory, kill members of Congress.

2011
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:24,080
It took a lot of planning to trespass, it looks like.

2012
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,080
Yeah.

2013
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:31,160
Thomas Caldwell, Jessica Watkins and Donovan Kroll are all Oath Keepers from Ohio and they're

2014
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,480
going to prison for a long time.

2015
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:37,120
According to an article in the Daily Beast, Caldwell stands accused of organizing a group

2016
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:42,000
of eight people to aggressively disrupt the certification of the Electoral College vote.

2017
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,520
The group used Facebook and the walkie-talkie Abzello to communicate, which is really fucking

2018
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:51,200
stupid because now the FBI has all that shit, including them messaging with someone on Facebook

2019
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:55,560
who is apparently encouraging them to kill members of Congress, saying, quote, all members

2020
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,440
are in the tunnels under the Capitol.

2021
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,440
Seal them in.

2022
01:30:58,440 --> 01:30:59,800
Turn on gas.

2023
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:05,740
Bill Gates is going to inject us all with computer chips to know where we are at all

2024
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:12,480
times so we need to protect ourselves by using unencrypted apps while in the Capitol.

2025
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:16,400
After leaving the Capitol, Caldwell posted on Facebook, quote, Proud Boys scuffled with

2026
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:19,640
cops and drove them inside to hide, breached the doors.

2027
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,800
One guy made it all the way to the House floor, another to Pelosi's office.

2028
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,040
A good time.

2029
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:25,840
We need to do this on the local level.

2030
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,600
Let's storm the Capitol in Ohio.

2031
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,240
Tell me when.

2032
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:33,180
In this individual case, Stewart's personal hands may be clean.

2033
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:37,160
One of the messages that the FBI had in the charging document was Caldwell saying, quote,

2034
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:41,640
I don't know if Stewie has even gotten out his call to arms, but it's a little frickin'

2035
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:42,640
late.

2036
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,160
This one we're doing on our own.

2037
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:46,520
We'll link up with a North Carolina crew.

2038
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:47,520
Oh, man.

2039
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,520
Stewart read that and was like, boom!

2040
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:50,520
I'm free!

2041
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:51,520
Yeah.

2042
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,520
I get...

2043
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,520
Yeah.

2044
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:57,240
Thank God they said that shit.

2045
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,240
Whee!

2046
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:01,920
I guess you could say that the best case scenario for Stewart Rhodes is to say that he's responsible

2047
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:06,240
for starting a decentralized right-wing extremist militia organization that he has so little

2048
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:11,340
control over that now it's being used by members to plan militaristic takeovers of state and

2049
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:12,880
federal capitol buildings.

2050
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:17,960
Also, he might be in hot water, because the charging document for those Oath Keepers does

2051
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:23,600
include a charge of conspiracy, and it explicitly alleges that they, quote, conspired together

2052
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:28,880
and with others whose identities are known and unknown to law enforcement at this time.

2053
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:29,880
Oh, boy.

2054
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:33,280
That's not a great sentence to see when you're the head of an organization that these people

2055
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:36,760
who were going to jail for a very long time were conspiring in.

2056
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:43,120
What I'm saying is, I would still be worried if I were Stewart, even though that, you know,

2057
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,920
the Stewie thing is pretty good for him.

2058
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:50,720
Hey, Don, a lot of our generals flipped, and you're in the RICO case.

2059
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:51,760
Is this good?

2060
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:52,760
Is this good or bad?

2061
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:53,760
Yeah.

2062
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:54,760
Yeah.

2063
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:57,760
He has stuff to be concerned about, and it's probably his best play to pretend that people

2064
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:58,760
are just trespassing.

2065
01:32:58,760 --> 01:32:59,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2066
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:00,760
It's probably his best interests.

2067
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:01,760
And they were just trespassing.

2068
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:02,760
Hey, it's no big deal.

2069
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:07,280
I mean, sure, they had to push through some barricades and kill a girl.

2070
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,280
It's no big deal.

2071
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:09,280
Yeah.

2072
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,320
So, like, we have a couple of Oath Keepers members that were in there.

2073
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,600
When they establish a defense fund, we'll contribute to it.

2074
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,120
They did not do that under my orders.

2075
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:21,920
They did that contrary to our plan for the day, which is just to PSD details and protect

2076
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:22,920
events.

2077
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:26,080
That's what we were there to do and protect individual Trump supporters from the radicals

2078
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,400
in the streets, like we've always done.

2079
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:32,720
But I'm not going to chuck them under the bus and condemn them as horrible people or

2080
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:35,200
traitors or any kind of nonsense like that.

2081
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:37,240
Too many on the right are adopting the same.

2082
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,240
Yeah, no.

2083
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:41,400
The police opened the doors after a few people knocked out some of the windows.

2084
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:44,520
They were ordered to suck in enough people to have a crowd.

2085
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,520
Stuart, don't you understand?

2086
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,120
We already have the narrative.

2087
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2088
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:49,520
Yeah.

2089
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:52,840
You have your own personal issues, and I understand how you don't want to throw your people under

2090
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:55,280
the bus, but they are going to jail for a long time.

2091
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,280
Long time.

2092
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:57,520
And, hey, that's tough.

2093
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,600
I feel for you.

2094
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:04,400
Infos has a narrative, and I'm not going to stray from it at all, not for your ass.

2095
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:09,360
Hey, buddy, you can thread the fine needle of it's good that they overthrew the Capitol,

2096
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:10,960
but it's bad that they lost.

2097
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,120
You can do that all you want.

2098
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:13,120
I wish you the best.

2099
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,120
Yeah, have fun.

2100
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:15,120
Have fun.

2101
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,120
You're also probably going to jail.

2102
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:24,000
So Jordan, Stuart Rhodes has some interesting ideas about cancel culture.

2103
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,080
I find that hard to believe.

2104
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:32,480
Apparently, I don't know exactly what the root is, how you get there from point A to

2105
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:38,880
point C, but you start with cancel culture, then things get out of control.

2106
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,700
Are we going to get back into white genocide?

2107
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:41,700
Mass graves.

2108
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:42,700
Okay.

2109
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:43,700
People dead in ditches.

2110
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:44,700
Okay.

2111
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:49,280
He'll play the good cop and say, we come in peace, but they really come for war.

2112
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:56,200
Stuart Rhodes, what do you expect from the left now?

2113
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:02,160
Are going to follow through with cancel culture, and it ends in a ditch.

2114
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,400
It's where it's going to end if you don't stop it.

2115
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:08,640
It ends in a ditch full of bodies, which is what the communists have done throughout their

2116
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:09,640
history.

2117
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:12,280
I mean, in fact, there's a state rep from New Mexico that's calling for all of us to

2118
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:17,400
be tattooed, if you were a Trump supporter, to be tattooed with a mark that's visible

2119
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,380
so they will know who you are.

2120
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:24,000
So we need to understand that it's far worse than the founding fathers faced.

2121
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,040
Citation needed on that New Mexico state rep.

2122
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:32,260
So if I understand correctly, if Toobin can't rub one out in a meeting, we're all going

2123
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:33,260
to mass graves.

2124
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:37,760
Yeah, you remember how Mao got rid of his political opponents by bringing up blog posts

2125
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:38,760
they'd written.

2126
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:39,760
Yeah, absolutely.

2127
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:40,760
They'd written.

2128
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:41,760
Yeah, yeah.

2129
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:42,760
Yeah.

2130
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:48,400
That was the main source of issues for the Cultural Revolution, I'm pretty sure, right?

2131
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:49,800
Oh, God.

2132
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:50,800
Okay.

2133
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:58,560
I just can't stand this overly dramatic person making these petty complaints, simultaneously

2134
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:04,840
being the leader of a fucking militia, where people did storm the Capitol and seemed to

2135
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:06,640
have pretty nefarious intent.

2136
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,000
I get it.

2137
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:14,500
You know, like when you're so used to having uncontrollable and impenetrable privilege

2138
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:20,240
your entire life and the lives of your forebears, I get that the idea of equality is threatening

2139
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,240
to you.

2140
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:22,240
Sure.

2141
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:27,320
But let's just remind ourselves that at best from a Biden presidency, we're going to get

2142
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:29,640
a little bit more equal.

2143
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:32,720
It's not going to change too much for white people.

2144
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:33,720
Yeah.

2145
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:34,720
And I think-

2146
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:35,720
It's just not.

2147
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:42,280
And I think that you'll see more coherent and more sincere aggressive critique and action

2148
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:43,280
from the left.

2149
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,280
100%.

2150
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:52,720
I think you will see more organizing against or in order to push policy for Biden from

2151
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,160
the left than you will from the right.

2152
01:36:54,160 --> 01:37:00,240
You'll see culture war nonsense and just a bunch of aggrievement from the right and you'll

2153
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:05,920
see an attempt to form more coherent social policy on the left.

2154
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:12,840
I find it hard to think that, you know, like watching Portland happen just recently-

2155
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:13,840
Since the inauguration.

2156
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:19,440
Yeah, since the inauguration, watching the way the cops reacted, it struck me that more

2157
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:23,760
likely what we're going to see from the Capitol riot is not that people are going to go back

2158
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,220
to DC, but that cops are going to fuck people up at home.

2159
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:32,000
You know, like the DC overthrow is going to everybody's home and it's cops fucking people

2160
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
up.

2161
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,880
Oh, and there's that video out of Tacoma of the police car driving through a bunch of

2162
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:37,880
people.

2163
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:38,880
Yeah.

2164
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,800
That's the legacy of the sixth.

2165
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:45,640
I think it's entirely possible and I think that there will also be the other legacy and

2166
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:50,880
that is I think that there will be a lot of people who end up going to prison or who at

2167
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:56,320
least get charged with a bunch of stuff and I think that we may or may not hear follow-ups

2168
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:01,360
on a lot of it, but I think a lot of people are going to be jammed up for that.

2169
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:05,760
And hey, three of them are Stuart Rhodes' militia members at least.

2170
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:12,400
Yeah, it's unfortunate that the people who created the conditions are absolutely not

2171
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,720
going to face any...

2172
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:14,720
Rico.

2173
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:15,720
Yeah.

2174
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:16,720
I mean, yeah.

2175
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:21,160
Anyway, Stuart believes that Trump, you know that guy?

2176
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:23,720
Last sitting president who was real.

2177
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:24,720
Okay.

2178
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:25,720
Okay.

2179
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:26,720
All right.

2180
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:30,280
That said, there is a potential for future elections to...

2181
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:31,280
No!

2182
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,280
Yep.

2183
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:33,280
Future elections...

2184
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,280
Sorry.

2185
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,000
They can go well.

2186
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Okay.

2187
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,040
But there's something that needs to happen for these elections to go well and that is

2188
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,200
paper ballots, but also...

2189
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:44,200
I'm fine with paper.

2190
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,200
I'm happy with paper ballots.

2191
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:46,200
Hold on.

2192
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,200
I like paper ballots.

2193
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,200
Hold on.

2194
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:49,200
That's just the beginning.

2195
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:50,200
That's a good beginning.

2196
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:51,200
There's a second step to this that is ludicrous.

2197
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:53,120
I don't know how I feel about the second step.

2198
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:57,480
Anything else you'd like to add in about 30 seconds we have left?

2199
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:00,520
We no longer have a legitimate president.

2200
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:01,520
This is...

2201
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,960
Trump was the last actual sitting legitimate president.

2202
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:07,760
We will see if we can ever have one again that's going to require paper ballots.

2203
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:11,140
At any local elections, you must insist on paper ballots if they won't do it.

2204
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:15,560
You hold your own parallel election using paper ballots to prove that your patriot candidate

2205
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:16,560
did win.

2206
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,200
Make sure you have a way to prove that.

2207
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:23,320
And from bottom to top, bottom up is how you take it back.

2208
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:24,560
That's right, Stuart.

2209
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,560
How do you do that?

2210
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,720
How do you run a second election?

2211
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:34,680
I think the funniest thing about that is that the only people who would be furious at the

2212
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:39,440
results of us going to entirely paper ballots would be these people.

2213
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:44,000
I have zero doubt in my mind that if we were using paper ballots, Stacey Abrams would have

2214
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,200
been governor of Georgia.

2215
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:47,200
Zero doubt.

2216
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:48,200
I would...

2217
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:49,200
I don't know.

2218
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,200
I don't know.

2219
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,200
Maybe.

2220
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:57,200
I don't know what I think entirely would change because I don't believe that there's rank

2221
01:39:57,200 --> 01:40:01,080
corruption of electronic voting.

2222
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:06,880
I think that there's problems with gerrymandering and access to polling places.

2223
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,160
And I don't know if that would be fully solved by paper ballots.

2224
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:11,160
I would doubt it.

2225
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:20,040
I would say that one thing that would be even more helpful than paper ballots would be having

2226
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:25,920
a holiday for elections, having multiple days that people can vote, which are things that

2227
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:32,440
people are doing, that we're making progress towards, and also expanding access to remote

2228
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:33,440
voting.

2229
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:38,360
Keeping Republicans away from how many polling places are allowed in, let's say, majority

2230
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:40,240
black neighborhoods.

2231
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:45,240
And not letting people like Stuart's friends hang around outside in the fifties.

2232
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:46,240
That's a good one.

2233
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,240
That's a good one.

2234
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:48,240
I like that one too.

2235
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:49,920
These things would make more progress than paper ballots.

2236
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:55,360
But I will say that one thing that is stupid is the idea that what you should do, if you

2237
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,720
can't have paper ballots, is run a second election.

2238
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:03,640
I think a parallel election would teach people a lot about how you would want to steal it.

2239
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:08,280
Here's a really good way that that process could get subverted and you'd never know it.

2240
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:09,280
How?

2241
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,280
So you're running a second election.

2242
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:11,280
Sure.

2243
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:15,260
I go ahead and vote differently in those two.

2244
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:17,600
How would you ever know?

2245
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:22,080
Well, because it would also be run by the Georgia election commission.

2246
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:25,480
Why would they ever do that?

2247
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:30,040
Well, because right wing nut jobs want it.

2248
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:38,560
No, he's talking about like the oath keepers running their own election.

2249
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:39,560
So dumb.

2250
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:42,800
I think they should have the UN come in to observe the results of the election.

2251
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,240
I think these guys would love that.

2252
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:46,000
They'd love it.

2253
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:52,240
So Stuart leaves and Alex, earlier, Stuart had said that Trump is a disappointment.

2254
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,240
He failed.

2255
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:57,800
He didn't step up when Judy called and all these people are going to be going around

2256
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:01,320
and saying that, hey, he was surrounded and making excuses for him.

2257
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:06,760
Like Alex and Roger Stone and Steve Pachannik and Jerome Corsi.

2258
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:07,760
No, no, no.

2259
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,920
Alex immediately after Stuart leaves.

2260
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,920
Oh, okay.

2261
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:11,920
Okay.

2262
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,200
And I respect Stuart Rhodes, the oath keepers.

2263
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:17,800
He was on last segment here on the Alex Jones show last hour.

2264
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:21,440
And he was saying, you think Trump really failed by not declaring the insurrection act.

2265
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:26,440
Well, Bob Barnes was a lawyer for Trump and was in some of the meetings and they were

2266
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:32,320
planning to have the military arrest Trump if he did that, even though it was lawful.

2267
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,160
And so Trump was totally surrounded.

2268
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:37,960
Oh, so it sounds like you're the kind of person who Stuart was talking about having no patience

2269
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:38,960
for it.

2270
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:39,960
Yeah.

2271
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:40,960
Yep.

2272
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:41,960
Yep.

2273
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:42,960
Yep.

2274
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:46,400
You're being a narcissistic shithead on inauguration day.

2275
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:51,400
I'm just, I've always tried to steer you as accurate as I can with the best info I have

2276
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:57,440
with real research and real historical understanding and quote sources.

2277
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:03,840
But I'll tell you most of the time I know more than my sources, what the Pentagon calls

2278
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:04,840
me up.

2279
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:09,320
The CIA calls me up to ask what I think of things.

2280
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:10,320
Not the other way around.

2281
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:13,040
I'm not trying to brag about that folks, but I have a good political brain.

2282
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,840
I've been doing this a long time.

2283
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:21,560
I've been trained in the field, in the school of hard knots as an organic Patriot citizen

2284
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:24,320
who wasn't trained by the system.

2285
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:31,080
Matt is seen by the system as the proof of someone's real gravitas is that they pull

2286
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:34,200
themselves up out of the mud.

2287
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:38,040
And I'm not telling you that to act powerful.

2288
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:44,060
I'm telling you that because that's the reality, ladies and gentlemen, now let's shift gears

2289
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:45,360
into Lady Gaga.

2290
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:46,960
Those pills might be kicking in.

2291
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:47,960
Yeah.

2292
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:48,960
Let's shift gears into Lady Gaga.

2293
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,440
I think that's good.

2294
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:53,520
They really do respect people who pull themselves up.

2295
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,880
How did Alex get his first show again?

2296
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:57,120
His dad bought an ad.

2297
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:58,120
Oh yeah, that's right.

2298
01:43:58,120 --> 01:43:59,120
Yeah.

2299
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:00,120
Yeah.

2300
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:01,120
Radio station.

2301
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:04,800
One of the other things I think is really funny is like just imagining just any other

2302
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:09,560
show where like somebody interviews somebody about like Medicare policy or something like

2303
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:10,560
that.

2304
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:11,560
And then they're like, you know what?

2305
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:19,200
I know way more about Medicare than these assholes that I have on.

2306
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,640
Rest in peace to Larry King.

2307
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:25,400
If only he had a few broadcasts where he's just like, man, all these people that I talked

2308
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:26,760
to are fucking stupid.

2309
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:32,400
The government calls me up for what I think about things.

2310
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:39,200
In any context other than Alex Jones, it becomes so clear how rude it is, how unprofessional

2311
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:40,200
it is.

2312
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:42,920
But for Alex, it's just like, yeah, this is the kind of dickhead that he is.

2313
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:47,240
I mean, if you have an M.O. for long enough, people will just be like, fine.

2314
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:48,240
Yeah.

2315
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:54,360
Also, speaking of which, with Larry King, I was reminded on his passing, and a lot of

2316
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:55,360
people posted the clip.

2317
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:56,360
Dick Rubin?

2318
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:57,360
Yes.

2319
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:58,360
Yeah.

2320
01:44:58,360 --> 01:44:59,360
I was glad they did.

2321
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:00,360
That's a good one.

2322
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:03,260
And if you haven't seen it, go check that out.

2323
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:05,280
Larry King was on with Dave Rubin.

2324
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:11,040
They were doing a live broadcast, and Larry King answered a call from his son.

2325
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:12,600
It was incredibly rude.

2326
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,600
It was beautiful.

2327
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:14,600
It was beautiful.

2328
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:15,600
It went on forever.

2329
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:16,600
It was beautiful.

2330
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:18,600
Dave Rubin is so pissed.

2331
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:19,600
Lovely.

2332
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,720
One of the best things ever.

2333
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:22,720
I love it.

2334
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:24,560
So Robert Barnes shows up now.

2335
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:25,560
Cool.

2336
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,600
We got to have some constitutional law to tell us why.

2337
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,600
Well, we already did.

2338
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:29,600
Oh, that's right.

2339
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,600
I'm a constitutional expert.

2340
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:31,720
Stuart Rhodes telling me about the Constitution.

2341
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:32,720
That's right.

2342
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:34,400
He's just basically there to shit on Q more.

2343
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,960
I think that that's Barnes' new thing.

2344
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,960
His new branding is anti-Q guy.

2345
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:39,960
I like it.

2346
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:40,960
That's a good rebrand.

2347
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:41,960
Sure.

2348
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:42,960
Whatever.

2349
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:45,800
But he also has an idea for what Trump needs to do now that he's out of office.

2350
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:51,000
I think Trump's great skill is his marketing, and his great asset is his brand.

2351
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:56,360
And so he should leverage both to look at an independent news media network, independent

2352
01:45:56,360 --> 01:46:01,440
information distribution network, independent social media platforms, maybe even look at

2353
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:04,400
independent banks and financial institutions.

2354
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:08,960
The reality is there's there's going to be huge demand for all of those things from people

2355
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:13,640
that are our Trump supporters because of the censorship campaigns and the blacklisting

2356
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:19,980
campaigns by the institutional media, by employment institutions, by financial institutions, by

2357
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:21,980
the social media oligarchs.

2358
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:27,500
The only way to counteract that is to have our own networks to do to replicate and repeat

2359
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,400
what Infowars has done.

2360
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:36,400
Build an independent brand that's not dependent at all either on corporate donations or sugar

2361
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:41,600
daddy billionaires, but also isn't dependent on big tech distribution platforms either.

2362
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:46,280
The Infowars is the model and the template for the president to mirror and follow in

2363
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:48,460
a broader context of industry.

2364
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:53,120
I'm not sure that I would want to be involved with a bank that's modeled after Infowars.

2365
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:56,380
I don't think I would feel confident having my money held by people who are constantly

2366
01:46:56,380 --> 01:46:59,560
ranting about the devil and how they might be out of business next week.

2367
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:00,560
I don't know.

2368
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:03,760
There are some good financial advisors.

2369
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:09,320
I think that those business models are, especially ones like, you know, banks.

2370
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:11,920
A lot of that has to do with confidence.

2371
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:17,360
That's one of the things that will go a long way in terms of making investors and depositors

2372
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:20,040
not make a rush on their money trying to get it out.

2373
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:23,200
I think that Alex is, uh, maybe...

2374
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:24,320
Here's what I want to do.

2375
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:28,640
I want to put my money in a bank that screams at me about how the government is going to

2376
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:30,640
take my money away from that bank.

2377
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:31,640
Right.

2378
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:34,680
Also, is this independent bank going to be involved in the FDIC?

2379
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:39,560
Also, if you're telling me that you want a social network started by Trump without a

2380
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:44,080
fucking daddy billionaire, you know what?

2381
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,080
It's a little incoherent.

2382
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:46,840
You know, um, yeah.

2383
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:47,840
It's all a little incoherent.

2384
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:52,600
They're functionally, like, his plan is functionally, let's secede from reality entirely.

2385
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:53,600
Yes.

2386
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:59,000
We don't have to live in, look, we can't leave the country because it's land, but our brains

2387
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
can secede.

2388
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Yeah.

2389
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:06,120
We will create a media ecosystem, which you've already done a lot of legwork on with InfoWars

2390
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:11,760
and Newsmax and OAN, and Trump has, you know, certainly elevated all these things.

2391
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:14,520
We'll create online spaces for us to interact.

2392
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:17,200
We'll create, um...

2393
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:21,760
You know, this would remind me a lot, and I don't think Barnes would like it too much.

2394
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:27,840
If this were actually enacted, I think it would remind me more of, like, the mining

2395
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:34,480
towns in the 1890s and early 1900s where the guy who owned the mine also printed your money.

2396
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:35,480
Right.

2397
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:36,480
Owned your home.

2398
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,720
Ran everything there.

2399
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:38,720
Printed the newspaper.

2400
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:40,480
I'm not positive that Barnes wouldn't like that.

2401
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:43,080
I mean, that's basically libertarian fantasy land.

2402
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:44,080
Yeah, that's true.

2403
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:47,280
Well, I think a lot of people would love it if they were the owner of the mine.

2404
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,960
See, that's what they think.

2405
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:50,960
And that is...

2406
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,760
I'm gonna get my own mine.

2407
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:59,240
Well, to an extent, I think people like Barnes and Alex are at a level of society where they

2408
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:03,280
view themselves as being okay in a libertarian landscape.

2409
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,280
Like that.

2410
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:08,180
Like that mining town, they would either be the person who runs the mine or somebody who's

2411
01:49:08,180 --> 01:49:10,600
an associate of the person who runs the mine.

2412
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:11,600
So they're fine.

2413
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:12,600
They're gonna be a monkey, Mike.

2414
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:13,600
They aren't the miners.

2415
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,600
You don't want to grow.

2416
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:15,600
You don't want to be a miner.

2417
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:16,600
Right.

2418
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:20,040
So they, you know, obviously that's the society that they would like to see and they would

2419
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:21,040
like to build.

2420
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:24,640
I'm going to tell you right now, a society built around people who don't want to work

2421
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:27,480
in the mine, but all want to own it.

2422
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:28,480
Not a good one.

2423
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:29,480
It's functional.

2424
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:30,480
Hmm.

2425
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:35,040
So Barnes, like I said, most of it is complaining about QAnon, which is just becoming annoying

2426
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,040
at this point.

2427
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:37,040
Yeah.

2428
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:41,240
And so he leaves and Alex, he said this and I got pretty excited.

2429
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:42,240
Here's a short compilation.

2430
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:45,380
We've got like a 20 minute one, but here's a minute and a half compilation of them calling

2431
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:50,720
for reprogramming, reeducation camps of the American people.

2432
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:53,100
So Alex is going to play that compilation.

2433
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:57,220
You know, I was curious cause I hadn't heard him play those clips, but he keeps talking

2434
01:49:57,220 --> 01:49:58,220
about it.

2435
01:49:58,220 --> 01:49:59,220
Yeah.

2436
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:02,000
So I decided that what I was going to do is I was going to look into each clip.

2437
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,120
Do it.

2438
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:04,120
Here's the deal.

2439
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:05,120
Okay.

2440
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:08,480
I took this compilation clip by clip and I found the context for each of them and I found

2441
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:12,320
that none of them really had anything to do with putting conservatives in camps or anything

2442
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:13,320
even close.

2443
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:15,400
And I was thinking like, what the fuck is going on?

2444
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:17,480
I spent a long time sorting this out.

2445
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:20,000
And then at the end of the compilation, it didn't matter.

2446
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,060
Cause Alex said this, Oh, the enemy is the American people.

2447
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:24,280
So that's another compilation.

2448
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:25,280
Sorry.

2449
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,280
We heard the wrong one.

2450
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:27,280
Go fuck yourself.

2451
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:29,680
I wasted so much time.

2452
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:30,680
Sorry.

2453
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:31,680
Yeah.

2454
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,680
Sorry.

2455
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:35,500
It turns out the compilation that I was talking about doesn't exist.

2456
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:39,320
That's the equivalent in my world of like me slipping on a banana peel.

2457
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:40,320
Yeah.

2458
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,200
That's that's Lucy holding the football.

2459
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:43,200
Yeah.

2460
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,200
Yeah.

2461
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:47,720
Alex just pulled it away forever and ever, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but

2462
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:49,360
Charlie Brown, what are we talking about?

2463
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:50,360
Somebody said camps.

2464
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:51,360
All right.

2465
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:52,720
Now, now, now Barnes, we did get one of the clips.

2466
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:53,720
It's not the crew's fault.

2467
01:50:53,720 --> 01:51:01,200
There's so many brainwash reeducate kill firing squad, uh, reprogram, but I wanted to just

2468
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:05,480
show one of the clips about reeducation camps because that's where they're going with this.

2469
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:06,480
Here it is.

2470
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:14,280
And Harvard now want to set up kind of a reeducation camps and moral rehabilitation centers and

2471
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:21,880
institutions for vetting people who had the chutzpah to work in the Trump administration.

2472
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:22,880
That's right.

2473
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,880
And that's him criticizing.

2474
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:25,400
We've got a bunch of clips that we'll add in post.

2475
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:28,840
We add this to live and where they actually say it.

2476
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:29,840
Yeah.

2477
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,160
So I guess Barnes is still around, but who cares?

2478
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:32,160
Yeah.

2479
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:35,180
Alex breaks into the air interview to say that he did find her on the clips, but unfortunately

2480
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:38,720
it's not a leftist saying they want to put conservatives in camps.

2481
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:41,760
It's just another right winger complaining about his fear that leftists are going to

2482
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,240
put conservatives in camps.

2483
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:44,240
Yeah.

2484
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:45,240
Yeah.

2485
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:48,420
This is noted Epstein lawyer, Alan Dershowitz complaining about Harvard students starting

2486
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:53,360
a petition to encourage the school to not hire anyone who worked for the Trump administration.

2487
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:55,280
This doesn't help Alex's point and guess what?

2488
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:56,960
That's a clip from November.

2489
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,040
How does the Dersh get allowed on TV?

2490
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:00,040
I don't know.

2491
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:01,040
I don't understand.

2492
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,040
I don't know, but that's the best.

2493
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:03,040
What's wrong with people?

2494
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:04,040
That's the best they could do.

2495
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:08,200
What's really interesting about that is that Alex is supposedly in possession of hundreds

2496
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:09,200
of these clips.

2497
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:10,200
Yeah.

2498
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:14,080
He breaks in with this clip after playing the wrong compilation.

2499
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,080
Yep.

2500
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:16,680
I don't know if he has all these clips.

2501
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:17,680
He does not.

2502
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:18,680
There are not then.

2503
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:19,680
Yeah.

2504
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:20,680
Because they don't exist.

2505
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:23,120
So Alex is kind of bored.

2506
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:24,120
Yeah.

2507
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:25,120
Because...

2508
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:27,160
Inauguration really isn't that big of a deal.

2509
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:28,160
No.

2510
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:30,320
And it also was shorter than he thought it was going to be.

2511
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:31,320
Yeah.

2512
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:33,600
Biden didn't make any real serious gaffes.

2513
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,320
And Alex is a little bit disappointed.

2514
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:36,320
Alright.

2515
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:40,080
I think terror attacks should happen any time something happens, turn your phone on, brother.

2516
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:41,440
We're going to be live until 10 o'clock tonight.

2517
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:42,440
Thank you so much.

2518
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:46,400
So yeah, there should have been attacks any time now.

2519
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:50,560
I'm pretty sure he's very disappointed nobody attacked the Capitol.

2520
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:51,560
Yeah.

2521
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:52,560
Yeah.

2522
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,840
Or around the country at some other state house or something.

2523
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:58,920
He's pretty much like, that's the whole reason we were going to do an all-day thing.

2524
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:00,960
Because I thought my buddies were going to start fires.

2525
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:02,960
I predicted false flags.

2526
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:03,960
Yeah.

2527
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:04,960
Come on, man.

2528
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:07,200
So it goes on a little bit longer.

2529
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:08,320
Alex is spinning his wheels.

2530
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:09,560
There's nothing really going on.

2531
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:10,920
It's very boring.

2532
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:11,920
I think they...

2533
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:13,520
We haven't had a false flag yet today.

2534
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:14,520
Maybe it's going to happen.

2535
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:15,520
I pray it doesn't.

2536
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,520
They were certainly saying what was coming.

2537
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:17,520
I think we put so much attention on this.

2538
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:18,520
Who was?

2539
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:22,480
And told patriots, don't go out and demonstrate on the 20th that we may have dodged a bullet.

2540
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:23,480
That's knock on wood.

2541
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:24,480
Yeah.

2542
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:31,720
So, you know, we stopped it from happening by saying it, but so, so awful.

2543
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:32,720
Yeah.

2544
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:42,360
Alex has Matt Bracken on, noted race war predictor Matt Bracken, noted shoddy Diagram fan Matt

2545
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:49,840
Bracken, noted ebook about race war salesman Matt Bracken.

2546
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:53,320
He's on and the two of them have a largely unproductive conversation.

2547
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:57,640
And I think Alex is so bored that he just leaves, like not in the same way as during

2548
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:59,080
his interview with Jason Jones.

2549
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:00,080
Sure.

2550
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,080
But like mentally in his head.

2551
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:04,240
He's just like Bracken, you're doing a half hour.

2552
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:07,400
You take care of this until John Rappaport shows up.

2553
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:08,920
Alex just leaves.

2554
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:09,920
That's great.

2555
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:11,680
Bracken hosts for a little while and I don't give a shit.

2556
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:15,720
And then John Rappaport shows up to host the fourth hour and this is where I turn things

2557
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:16,720
off.

2558
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:17,720
Okay.

2559
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:18,720
Hello everybody.

2560
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:19,720
John here.

2561
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:33,240
I thought I would celebrate the Biden inauguration by, uh, putting myself in a virtual loft as

2562
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:40,520
you can see behind me in a virtual city that is on virtual lockdown.

2563
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:49,360
And my refrigerator is stocked with virtual food because it was of course a virtual inauguration

2564
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,960
after a virtual election.

2565
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:53,680
Rappaport got a zoom background.

2566
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:56,040
This is riveting stuff.

2567
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:58,440
I can't believe how boring that is.

2568
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:04,080
That is the most bored I have been so fast in the shortest period of time.

2569
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:06,760
35 seconds for him to explain that he got a zoom background.

2570
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:08,680
That was brutally boring.

2571
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:09,680
Outrageous.

2572
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:10,680
That's terrifying.

2573
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:11,680
Inappropriate.

2574
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:12,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2575
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:13,680
It makes me, it makes me mad.

2576
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:14,680
Yeah.

2577
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:15,680
Yeah.

2578
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:21,200
Well, I could have probably kept going and listened to The War Room, although that's

2579
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:22,960
not a show that I normally listen to.

2580
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:23,960
True.

2581
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:28,920
Owen Schroyer is basically a less competent, broey version of Alex.

2582
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:29,920
Yeah.

2583
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:36,440
And I just, what I, what I got to by the end of Alex's show was this sort of sense that

2584
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:38,560
they're all disappointed.

2585
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:43,520
There's no real new talking points being developed in terms of like what happened on the sixth.

2586
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:44,520
Yeah.

2587
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:45,520
Biden's a fake president.

2588
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:46,520
Whoop-dee-doo.

2589
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:49,080
This is all exactly the way they've been going.

2590
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:52,880
I didn't, I didn't have any faith that this was going to develop into anything interesting.

2591
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:53,880
Right.

2592
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:58,760
Simultaneously, I didn't think that there was any chance that Owen's show could be any

2593
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:01,800
more offensive than the American Journal.

2594
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:07,540
I don't think that there could be anything that topped that in terms of the dangerousness,

2595
01:56:07,540 --> 01:56:10,720
the offensiveness, the bigotedness.

2596
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,360
And the banality of it.

2597
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:13,360
True.

2598
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:15,600
And the banality of it was such a terrifying part.

2599
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:16,600
Yeah.

2600
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:20,000
It's always the scariest part where they're just like, we have to kill millions of people.

2601
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,480
Like just tossing it off.

2602
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:22,480
Yeah.

2603
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:23,480
Yeah.

2604
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:26,440
And so I kind of felt done with Inauguration Day.

2605
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:27,440
Sure.

2606
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:33,360
We saw some outrageous white nationalist slash supremacist slash neo-Nazi content in the

2607
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:34,520
morning show.

2608
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:40,320
We saw Alex disappointed that his predictions of bombings and false flags didn't come true.

2609
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:44,480
And therefore he had no content on his own show.

2610
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:48,280
I just, oh, and Stuart Rhodes showed up.

2611
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:49,280
So I was done.

2612
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,280
Yeah.

2613
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:51,280
I was done.

2614
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:52,280
I think we got what we needed out of it.

2615
01:56:52,280 --> 01:56:53,280
Yeah.

2616
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:56,360
I think Alex definitely didn't get what he wanted out of it, which was a lot of terror

2617
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:57,360
attacks.

2618
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:58,360
Yep.

2619
01:56:58,360 --> 01:56:59,360
Yeah.

2620
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:00,360
I do think that that was something he was kind of hoping for.

2621
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:01,360
Yeah.

2622
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:04,680
Why else would you say we're going to do, look, if you're Info Wars and you're saying

2623
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:09,460
we're going to do a live 10 hour broadcast, that's not because you think the inauguration

2624
01:57:09,460 --> 01:57:10,460
is going to go well.

2625
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:17,540
No, or that you have like something, some analysis or something to say, a breakdown

2626
01:57:17,540 --> 01:57:21,160
of policy, a breakdown of like the agenda that Biden is setting out for in his first

2627
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:22,160
hundred days.

2628
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:24,080
You really want to get down into the nitty gritty.

2629
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:25,080
You want to get in the weeds.

2630
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:26,080
You want to be a policy wonk.

2631
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:27,080
He is a policy wonk.

2632
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:28,080
We all know he's a policy wonk.

2633
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:29,080
We all know that.

2634
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:31,080
He says it on our show like five times a show.

2635
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:32,080
All the time.

2636
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:33,080
Yeah.

2637
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:34,080
Yeah.

2638
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:35,080
Yeah.

2639
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:38,080
I don't think he has the ability to, nor the interest in it, and his audience wouldn't

2640
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:40,520
be at all motivated by it.

2641
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:41,520
This is Info Wars.

2642
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,520
We want spectacle.

2643
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:43,520
Yes.

2644
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:44,520
And we want explosions.

2645
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:45,520
Yes.

2646
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:48,800
And apparently we want a dork being a bigot.

2647
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:50,400
Yeah, I guess so.

2648
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:55,460
Anyway, we'll be back probably on Friday, I think, for another episode.

2649
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:57,880
Maybe a bonus little thing on Wednesday.

2650
01:57:57,880 --> 01:57:59,080
Let's hope.

2651
01:57:59,080 --> 01:58:05,420
But and then we'll discuss the fallout of Alex losing his Supreme Court in Texas appeal,

2652
01:58:05,420 --> 01:58:08,200
which I think will be maybe interesting.

2653
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:09,200
Maybe not.

2654
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:10,200
Who knows?

2655
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:11,200
Yeah.

2656
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,200
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

2657
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:13,200
We do have a website.

2658
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:14,200
It's knowledgefight.com.

2659
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:15,200
We're also on Twitter.

2660
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:16,200
We are on Twitter.

2661
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:17,200
It's at knowledgefight.com.

2662
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:18,200
And I go to Betjordan.

2663
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:19,200
We're also on Facebook.

2664
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:20,200
We are Facebook.

2665
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:25,000
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to do God's work.

2666
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Yeah.

2667
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
We'll be back.

2668
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
But until then, I'm Neo.

2669
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I'm Leo.

2670
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I'm DZXclerk.

2671
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,000
I'm Daryl Rundis.

2672
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I got bad news for you, Harrison Smith.

2673
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
You have attracted my attention.

2674
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Andy in Kansas.

2675
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Thanks for being on the air.

2676
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Thanks for holding.

2677
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Hello, Alex.

2678
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,000
I'm a first time caller.

2679
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
I'm a huge fan.

2680
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,000
I love your work.

2681
01:58:41,000 --> 01:59:10,000
I love you.
