N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.800 --> 00:19.440
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.320 --> 00:25.120
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.240
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.240
Knowledgefight.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.240
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.240
Want to learn?

00:35.240 --> 00:36.040
Need, need Money.

00:36.040 --> 00:39.240
G dispensaries labor.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.740
TSD Community Veterans Office.

00:42.820 --> 00:50.320
Stop it, Andy Tian MP and the looped up to the rollins.

00:50.520 --> 00:50.060
Boston color

00:50.160 --> 00:56.100
with your band and love your world Sit sculpture.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.100
I love you.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.100
Hey everybody!

00:58.100 --> 00:59.100
Welcome back to Knowledge Fat, I'm Dan.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.100
I'm Jordan.

01:00.100 --> 01:04.380
We're a couple dudes that like to sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk a little

01:04.380 --> 01:05.380
bit about Alex Jones.

01:05.380 --> 01:06.380
Oh indeed we are Dan.

01:06.380 --> 01:07.380
Jordan.

01:07.380 --> 01:08.380
Dan!

01:08.380 --> 01:09.380
Jordan!

01:09.380 --> 01:10.380
I have a quick question for you.

01:10.380 --> 01:11.380
What up?

01:11.380 --> 01:12.380
What's your bright spot today?

01:12.380 --> 01:14.720
My bright spot today Jordan is actually a little bit of something that we need to play

01:14.720 --> 01:15.720
catch up on.

01:15.720 --> 01:16.720
Okay.

01:16.720 --> 01:17.720
Alright.

01:17.720 --> 01:22.740
A little bit back we got something in the mail bags, yep, from Hannah out in Erie, Pennsylvania.

01:22.740 --> 01:23.740
Alright.

01:23.740 --> 01:24.740
Alright.

01:24.740 --> 01:25.980
And I need to make good on this.

01:25.980 --> 01:26.980
How are our sisters doing?

01:26.980 --> 01:27.980
Ah they're great.

01:27.980 --> 01:28.980
Okay good.

01:28.980 --> 01:31.260
Hannah sent us some chocolates.

01:31.260 --> 01:32.260
Okay.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.700
From Erie, Pennsylvania.

01:33.700 --> 01:34.820
The Pride of Erie.

01:34.820 --> 01:35.820
Yes.

01:35.820 --> 01:38.340
Some sponge candy from two different brands.

01:38.340 --> 01:39.340
Okay.

01:39.340 --> 01:40.340
Romolo.

01:40.340 --> 01:41.340
Uh huh.

01:41.340 --> 01:42.340
And what is this other one?

01:42.340 --> 01:43.340
It's Stefa something or other.

01:43.340 --> 01:45.340
Stefa something or other.

01:45.340 --> 01:46.340
Stefanelli's!

01:46.340 --> 01:47.340
Stefanelli's!

01:47.340 --> 01:49.340
I like it.

01:49.340 --> 01:57.260
Hannah asked us to, how did Hannah put it, there is a rivalry between two families in

01:57.260 --> 01:58.800
Erie that are chocolatiers.

01:58.800 --> 02:02.300
One makes a chocolate that is deemed quote better than the other.

02:02.300 --> 02:07.080
I want you two to do a blindish taste test between the two milk chocolate sponge candies

02:07.080 --> 02:10.660
and so we did that before the show because chewing into the mic does disgust some people.

02:10.660 --> 02:12.140
Many people find it horrific.

02:12.140 --> 02:14.660
We don't want to set anyone off.

02:14.660 --> 02:19.820
So I, we've tried these and Hannah would like us to guess which one is the classier one

02:19.820 --> 02:23.120
or just considered the classier one and I say it's Stefanelli's.

02:23.120 --> 02:27.660
And I say it is Gondola's, nope what is it?

02:27.660 --> 02:28.660
Romolo.

02:28.660 --> 02:29.660
Yeah Gondola.

02:29.660 --> 02:30.660
Gondola.

02:30.660 --> 02:31.660
Yeah.

02:31.660 --> 02:35.400
I got Gondor on the brain so, no I say it's the reverse.

02:35.400 --> 02:39.660
My bright spot is that I think I'm pretty sure I'm right in advance.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.940
I'm not saying that you're not, I'm just, I'm playing the game.

02:42.940 --> 02:46.620
Exactly, we were talking about this before we started recording as we were eating the

02:46.620 --> 02:50.140
chocolates and your reason for choosing Romolo is almost oppositional defiance.

02:50.140 --> 02:51.140
No it's not!

02:51.140 --> 02:52.980
Why would you ask the question?

02:52.980 --> 02:54.820
We both agree which one tastes better.

02:54.820 --> 02:57.340
Because it's a local thing.

02:57.340 --> 03:01.220
It's something that people outside of Erie probably don't know too much about these rival

03:01.220 --> 03:02.220
chocolatiers.

03:02.220 --> 03:03.220
Hatfields and McCoys of chocolate.

03:03.220 --> 03:09.580
Sure, sure, I just assumed that one of them, if it's better it's the less, or if the one

03:09.580 --> 03:15.660
that people assume is better is the one that we're supposed to say is not as good.

03:15.660 --> 03:17.460
I don't think that either of them were bad.

03:17.460 --> 03:19.180
No, no, they're both delicious.

03:19.180 --> 03:20.180
They were both fine.

03:20.180 --> 03:21.180
Love it.

03:21.180 --> 03:25.340
I just think the Romolo was a little bit, the chocolate was a little too dry.

03:25.340 --> 03:26.340
A little thicker?

03:26.340 --> 03:27.340
Yes.

03:27.340 --> 03:28.340
Doesn't melt in your mouth.

03:28.340 --> 03:29.340
No.

03:29.340 --> 03:30.340
No, absolutely not.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.340
Anyway, that's my bright spot.

03:31.340 --> 03:32.340
Indeed.

03:32.340 --> 03:33.340
Sponge candy.

03:33.340 --> 03:34.340
It's delicious.

03:34.340 --> 03:35.340
Absolutely.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.340
Jordan?

03:36.340 --> 03:37.380
Dan, I have the rare triple bright spot.

03:37.380 --> 03:39.100
The rare triple bright spot.

03:39.100 --> 03:40.100
He's batting for the cycle.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.100
Absolutely.

03:41.100 --> 03:42.900
Wait, you need quadruple for that.

03:42.900 --> 03:47.820
First things first, somebody reached out to me, sent me an email, and they had done a

03:47.820 --> 03:53.860
better job of converting my terrible PDF into an EPUB and a MOBI than I could ever do.

03:53.860 --> 03:54.860
Oh, that's awesome.

03:54.860 --> 03:58.060
Yeah, huge shout out to Old Man Sitko, as he would like to be named.

03:58.060 --> 03:59.060
All right.

03:59.060 --> 04:01.540
Yeah, the formatting of your book left something to be desired.

04:01.540 --> 04:02.540
It was awful.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.700
I tried everything 30 different times.

04:04.700 --> 04:05.700
It's hard.

04:05.700 --> 04:08.100
It's just like, I can't, yeah.

04:08.100 --> 04:10.100
He did an amazing job.

04:10.100 --> 04:16.540
Second, I was going back through my... I've been writing about music for a while now.

04:16.540 --> 04:17.540
So I've been-

04:17.540 --> 04:18.540
Mostly Taylor Swift.

04:18.540 --> 04:19.620
Digging, almost entirely Taylor Swift.

04:19.620 --> 04:25.380
But I've been digging through all my old crates and stuff like that, and I finally re-listened

04:25.380 --> 04:31.300
to the Feist version of Lover's Spit by The Broken Social Scene.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.900
I think it was off Beehives or something like that.

04:33.900 --> 04:34.900
So good.

04:34.900 --> 04:39.460
Feist manages to be both sonorous and breathy at the same time, and it's incredible.

04:39.460 --> 04:40.460
Okay.

04:40.460 --> 04:41.460
It's beautiful.

04:41.460 --> 04:43.460
And then the third is something that you just gave to me-

04:43.460 --> 04:44.460
Yeah.

04:44.460 --> 04:45.460
Well, I didn't give it to you.

04:45.460 --> 04:46.460
No, no, no.

04:46.460 --> 04:47.460
You did not.

04:47.460 --> 04:48.460
You handed it to me.

04:48.460 --> 04:49.460
Yes.

04:49.460 --> 04:50.460
Physically.

04:50.460 --> 04:52.300
That comes from the... What was mine again?

04:52.300 --> 04:53.300
What?

04:53.300 --> 04:56.940
I had a mail bin.

04:56.940 --> 04:57.940
What did I have?

04:57.940 --> 04:58.940
I don't know.

04:58.940 --> 04:59.940
A box?

04:59.940 --> 05:00.940
It's not my job to remember your passive aggressive kits.

05:00.940 --> 05:01.940
I think I remember there was a... Wow.

05:01.940 --> 05:04.060
That's not my job.

05:04.060 --> 05:10.500
I just thought you would be offended enough by them that you... Anyways, I was sent by-

05:10.500 --> 05:11.740
Yeah, from Amy.

05:11.740 --> 05:12.740
From Amy.

05:12.740 --> 05:13.740
Raptor Princess Amy.

05:13.740 --> 05:20.820
Raptor Princess Amy, a signed copy of, I believe, the first American edition of The Long Dark

05:20.820 --> 05:22.100
Tea Time of the Soul by Douglas Adams.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.140
It was your favorite book of Doug's.

05:24.140 --> 05:25.480
It is maybe my favorite book.

05:25.480 --> 05:31.140
This one and So Long and Thanks for All the Fish are my two favorites.

05:31.140 --> 05:32.140
That's really awesome.

05:32.140 --> 05:33.140
Yeah.

05:33.140 --> 05:34.140
That's amazing.

05:34.140 --> 05:35.140
No, it's incredible.

05:35.140 --> 05:39.220
Actually, in that package, I also got a survival heirloom seed vault.

05:39.220 --> 05:40.220
Yes, gorgeous.

05:40.220 --> 05:41.220
And some awesome socks.

05:41.220 --> 05:45.340
A little known fact about Dan, I'm a man who likes funny socks.

05:45.340 --> 05:46.580
He's a man who likes funny socks.

05:46.580 --> 05:51.720
One of them says crazy cat dude and has some cats on it, and the other one is a pro wrestling

05:51.720 --> 05:52.720
themed socks.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.720
I'm very excited.

05:53.720 --> 05:54.720
Fantastic.

05:54.720 --> 05:55.720
Thank you, Amy.

05:55.720 --> 05:56.720
Yes, thank you very much.

05:56.720 --> 05:57.720
That's very nice of you.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.220
I was going to get to that on our next mini episode.

06:00.220 --> 06:01.220
Sure.

06:01.220 --> 06:02.220
Sure.

06:02.220 --> 06:03.220
I can't.

06:03.220 --> 06:07.180
I mean, you handed it to me, and I need to tell the world because it's incredible for

06:07.180 --> 06:08.180
me.

06:08.180 --> 06:09.180
It's a huge moment.

06:09.180 --> 06:10.180
Yeah.

06:10.180 --> 06:11.180
I'm very excited.

06:11.180 --> 06:13.140
We might have to stop the show.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.140
Yeah.

06:14.140 --> 06:19.020
I'm a little overstimulated right now, but it's incredible.

06:19.020 --> 06:20.020
Take some breaths.

06:20.020 --> 06:21.020
I will.

06:21.020 --> 06:22.020
Because we got some stuff to go over today.

06:22.020 --> 06:23.020
I will.

06:23.020 --> 06:24.020
Let's do it.

06:24.020 --> 06:26.940
Today, Jordan, we're going to be going over Inauguration 2021, Black Jack.

06:26.940 --> 06:27.940
Black Jack.

06:27.940 --> 06:28.940
Now you're so fast.

06:28.940 --> 06:30.580
But I'm trying to beat you to it.

06:30.580 --> 06:31.900
Yeah, no, I got to race you.

06:31.900 --> 06:32.900
This is going to get weird.

06:32.900 --> 06:35.800
Yeah, it is.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.460
The rule is you can't start saying Black Jack until one gets out of my mouth.

06:39.460 --> 06:40.800
No, it's traditional Jeopardy rules.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.800
You have to buzz in.

06:41.800 --> 06:42.800
Oh.

06:42.800 --> 06:47.180
So on Jeopardy, you have to wait until the sentence, the question is finished, and then

06:47.180 --> 06:51.900
you have like 0.001 second to buzz in, and whoever does it fastest.

06:51.900 --> 06:52.900
But if you click it too soon...

06:52.900 --> 06:53.900
Do I have to buzz?

06:53.900 --> 06:54.900
No, you don't have to buzz.

06:54.900 --> 06:55.900
Okay.

06:55.900 --> 06:56.900
It's just a game.

06:56.900 --> 06:57.900
Okay.

06:57.900 --> 06:58.900
We'll figure it out as we go along.

06:58.900 --> 07:00.900
Anyway, we're talking about Inauguration Day.

07:00.900 --> 07:03.840
And Alex set out to do a marathon all day.

07:03.840 --> 07:07.080
And part of the reason for this is that he was expecting a false flag terrorist attack

07:07.080 --> 07:08.080
to happen.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.080
Totally.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.080
It did not happen.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.080
Totally.

07:11.080 --> 07:14.060
And so it kind of falls apart, the idea of it being a marathon.

07:14.060 --> 07:15.060
Naturally.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.300
Pretty quick.

07:16.300 --> 07:19.740
So today what we're going to be doing is we're going to be going over the American Journal,

07:19.740 --> 07:21.460
hosted by Harrison Smith.

07:21.460 --> 07:22.460
Okay.

07:22.460 --> 07:24.620
Some other issues about Harrison Smith.

07:24.620 --> 07:25.620
Right.

07:25.620 --> 07:29.580
Then Alex Jones' show, Until John Rappaport Takes Over the Fourth Hour.

07:29.580 --> 07:30.580
Sure.

07:30.580 --> 07:31.580
He's going to also do the War Room.

07:31.580 --> 07:37.300
But by that point, this thing had ground to a halt to such an extent that I just was like,

07:37.300 --> 07:39.060
I got no interest in this.

07:39.060 --> 07:43.020
And the American Journal I honestly think was a bit more interesting than I expected

07:43.020 --> 07:44.020
it to be.

07:44.020 --> 07:45.380
And there's some issues that we really need to talk about.

07:45.380 --> 07:46.380
All right.

07:46.380 --> 07:47.380
Let's do it.

07:47.380 --> 07:51.940
About this fucking ding-dong named Harrison.

07:51.940 --> 07:55.860
Also I'd like to say, what could have been one of my bright spots is all of the stories

07:55.860 --> 08:00.060
that are coming out about Alex losing his appeal in the Texas Supreme Court.

08:00.060 --> 08:01.060
Oh yeah.

08:01.060 --> 08:05.420
We are aware of that, but inauguration must be taken care of before we jump down that

08:05.420 --> 08:06.420
road.

08:06.420 --> 08:07.420
So we'll deal with that later in the week.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.420
Absolutely.

08:08.420 --> 08:12.020
For all those who were champing at the bit for us to get to that.

08:12.020 --> 08:13.020
Yeah.

08:13.020 --> 08:16.980
Before we get down to inauguration though, we've got to thank some Joe Biden donors.

08:16.980 --> 08:19.660
Oh, that's a good idea.

08:19.660 --> 08:21.140
I don't know that to be the case at all.

08:21.140 --> 08:22.140
I don't know if any.

08:22.140 --> 08:26.340
Some people who have supported our show had signed up in our policy wonks.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.340
Yeah.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.340
So first, Elliott Morgan, thank you so much.

08:28.340 --> 08:29.580
You are now a policy wonk.

08:29.580 --> 08:30.580
I'm a policy wonk.

08:30.580 --> 08:31.580
Thank you, Elliott.

08:31.580 --> 08:32.580
Thank you.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.580
Next.

08:33.580 --> 08:34.580
Don DeGran Prix's ghost.

08:34.580 --> 08:35.580
Thank you so much.

08:35.580 --> 08:36.580
You are now a policy wonk.

08:36.580 --> 08:37.580
I'm a policy wonk.

08:37.580 --> 08:38.580
Thank you very much, Don DeGran.

08:38.580 --> 08:39.580
How's he doing in heaven?

08:39.580 --> 08:40.580
Bad news.

08:40.580 --> 08:41.580
No.

08:41.580 --> 08:42.580
Bad news.

08:42.580 --> 08:43.580
Well, he's doing good in heaven, actually.

08:43.580 --> 08:44.580
Is he doing good in heaven?

08:44.580 --> 08:45.580
I don't think he made it.

08:45.580 --> 08:46.580
Grifter heaven.

08:46.580 --> 08:47.580
Yeah.

08:47.580 --> 08:48.580
Next, Andrew Kemp.

08:48.580 --> 08:49.580
Thank you so much.

08:49.580 --> 08:50.580
You are now a policy wonk.

08:50.580 --> 08:51.580
I'm a policy wonk.

08:51.580 --> 08:52.580
Thank you, Andrew.

08:52.580 --> 08:53.580
Thank you.

08:53.580 --> 08:56.860
Next, Corey, and actually Corey made an interesting request, and that is that he'd like to be

08:56.860 --> 08:59.980
known as a policy wonk, so congratulations, Corey.

08:59.980 --> 09:01.340
You're a policy wonk.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.580
I'm a policy wonk.

09:02.580 --> 09:04.240
Thank you very much.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.240
Policy wonk, Corey.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.900
I said Corey's a dog.

09:06.900 --> 09:07.900
Could be.

09:07.900 --> 09:08.900
Yeah.

09:08.900 --> 09:09.900
Next, I'm a doctor, and my time is precious.

09:09.900 --> 09:10.900
Thank you so much.

09:10.900 --> 09:11.900
You are now a policy wonk.

09:11.900 --> 09:12.900
I'm a policy wonk.

09:12.900 --> 09:13.900
Thank you very much, and we agree.

09:13.900 --> 09:14.900
Yeah.

09:14.900 --> 09:15.900
Yeah.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.620
Next, Mr. Muscarello, a very fine fellow.

09:17.620 --> 09:18.620
Thank you so much.

09:18.620 --> 09:19.900
You are now a policy wonk.

09:19.900 --> 09:20.900
I'm a policy wonk.

09:20.900 --> 09:21.900
Thank you so much.

09:21.900 --> 09:22.940
Thank you very much.

09:22.940 --> 09:24.780
Why not Mr. Toad's Wild Ride?

09:24.780 --> 09:26.020
Let's just roll with it.

09:26.020 --> 09:27.500
Gregorium's Wonder Emporium.

09:27.500 --> 09:32.100
Then finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple folks who signed up on an elevated

09:32.100 --> 09:33.100
level.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.100
I appreciate that very much.

09:34.100 --> 09:36.740
So, Jodie C., not the band Jodeci.

09:36.740 --> 09:37.740
Jodie C.

09:37.740 --> 09:38.740
Jodie C.

09:38.740 --> 09:39.740
Yes.

09:39.740 --> 09:40.740
Thank you so much.

09:40.740 --> 09:41.740
You are now a technocrat.

09:41.740 --> 09:42.740
Lord Subwalled.

09:42.740 --> 09:43.740
Thank you so much.

09:43.740 --> 09:44.740
You are now a technocrat.

09:44.740 --> 09:45.740
But it was the band Lord Subwalled.

09:45.740 --> 09:46.740
Yes, it was.

09:46.740 --> 09:47.740
Yes.

09:47.740 --> 09:49.860
And Dan didn't read my joke name when I became a policy wonk.

09:49.860 --> 09:50.860
Thank you so much.

09:50.860 --> 09:51.860
You are now a technocrat.

09:51.860 --> 09:52.860
I'm a policy wonk.

09:52.860 --> 09:53.860
Crikey, mate.

09:53.860 --> 09:54.860
That's fantastic.

09:54.860 --> 09:55.860
Have yourself a brew.

09:55.860 --> 09:56.860
How's your 401k doing, bro?

09:56.860 --> 09:57.860
All right.

09:57.860 --> 09:59.860
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

09:59.860 --> 10:01.340
Let's just get down to business.

10:01.340 --> 10:03.420
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

10:03.420 --> 10:05.340
Why are you pimps so good?

10:05.340 --> 10:06.980
My neck is freakishly large.

10:06.980 --> 10:09.760
I declare info war on you.

10:09.760 --> 10:10.760
Thank you so much, all.

10:10.760 --> 10:11.760
Yes.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.460
And there's a certain irony to this, too, and that is that I still didn't say whatever

10:14.460 --> 10:16.460
the joke name is.

10:16.460 --> 10:22.360
Well, I was thinking about it, and I was like, our inability to get to your joke name immediately

10:22.360 --> 10:26.060
is in some ways a passive extortion.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.580
You got to get up to technocrat if you want to jump to the line.

10:28.580 --> 10:29.580
That's not the joke name.

10:29.580 --> 10:30.660
No, of course not.

10:30.660 --> 10:32.220
I don't know what the joke name was.

10:32.220 --> 10:33.220
I don't know.

10:33.220 --> 10:34.220
I lose track.

10:34.220 --> 10:35.220
I can't keep track of this stuff.

10:35.220 --> 10:40.460
Anyway, Jordan, we're going to jump in here at the beginning, where it all started.

10:40.460 --> 10:42.260
In the beginning, there was the word.

10:42.260 --> 10:44.780
I was going to say, we're going all the way back, huh?

10:44.780 --> 10:46.580
No, let's skip back a little bit.

10:46.580 --> 10:47.580
Little bit.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.580
Little bit.

10:48.580 --> 10:49.580
Okay, move forward.

10:49.580 --> 10:50.580
The beginning of the day.

10:50.580 --> 10:51.580
Abraham baguette, and then, okay.

10:51.580 --> 10:56.020
Eventually you get down the line and you find Harrison Smith, and he's sitting at a desk

10:56.020 --> 10:57.340
and America has fallen.

10:57.340 --> 10:58.340
Okay.

10:58.340 --> 10:59.340
You're watching American Journal.

10:59.340 --> 11:07.560
This is a dirge of sorts, a funeral song for the United States, for the Republic as we

11:07.560 --> 11:08.560
know it.

11:08.560 --> 11:12.300
This is now a wartime broadcast.

11:12.300 --> 11:16.060
America, the Republic has fallen.

11:16.060 --> 11:17.060
Again.

11:17.060 --> 11:23.140
With Donald Trump vacating the office, leaving the White House, and taking Air Force One

11:23.140 --> 11:25.820
while he still can to Florida.

11:25.820 --> 11:27.620
These people are intensely dramatic.

11:27.620 --> 11:28.620
I know.

11:28.620 --> 11:29.620
This is so...

11:29.620 --> 11:30.620
Yeah.

11:30.620 --> 11:31.620
Yeah.

11:31.620 --> 11:32.620
All right.

11:32.620 --> 11:37.300
I think I start to realize when I look through the prism of people similar to Harrison or

11:37.300 --> 11:42.500
to Mike Adams and their just overly dramatic tendencies, I kind of realize that Alex is

11:42.500 --> 11:48.780
the same, except the way it manifests isn't like this weird over the top modeling America

11:48.780 --> 11:49.860
has fallen.

11:49.860 --> 11:51.900
It's kind of sci-fi and a little horror-y.

11:51.900 --> 11:52.900
Yeah.

11:52.900 --> 11:53.900
Yeah.

11:53.900 --> 11:58.900
I think that's why it's a little bit less like obviously like really dramatic.

11:58.900 --> 12:05.060
It is a little bit like what's going on is these are all the theater kids who are so

12:05.060 --> 12:10.800
into masculinity they couldn't join the theater program, and so they're trying to get all

12:10.800 --> 12:12.180
this theater kid stuff out.

12:12.180 --> 12:14.340
I would have been a theater kid, but they were too inclusive.

12:14.340 --> 12:15.340
Exactly.

12:15.340 --> 12:16.340
Totally.

12:16.340 --> 12:17.340
100 percent.

12:17.340 --> 12:18.340
Yeah.

12:18.340 --> 12:19.340
I tried debate.

12:19.340 --> 12:20.340
Yeah.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.060
I had to play football because I was too manly.

12:22.060 --> 12:23.180
Harrison did not play football.

12:23.180 --> 12:24.180
No.

12:24.180 --> 12:25.180
Well, that's probably true.

12:25.180 --> 12:26.180
He's too much of a theater kid.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.180
Too much.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.180
Yeah.

12:28.180 --> 12:31.180
So there's an interesting dynamic that's going on throughout most of the coverage here on

12:31.180 --> 12:37.060
the 20th, and that is wrestling with Trump's legacy in the last hour of his presidency.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.060
Okay.

12:38.060 --> 12:42.740
Harrison comes solidly down on the side of that dude done fucked up.

12:42.740 --> 12:50.780
And I got to be honest, Donald Trump completely failed, utterly, totally failed.

12:50.780 --> 12:58.180
I was having this debate with my dad yesterday, and he was saying, you know, Trump was probably

12:58.180 --> 12:59.820
the greatest president in my lifetime.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.540
I said, it doesn't matter.

13:02.540 --> 13:03.820
He failed.

13:03.820 --> 13:11.380
He left us not with any lasting triumph, but with ash.

13:11.380 --> 13:14.660
You got some ash.

13:14.660 --> 13:17.300
I mean, I think a lot of people probably predicted this.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.300
Who?

13:18.300 --> 13:19.300
How?

13:19.300 --> 13:20.300
Why?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.300
When?

13:21.300 --> 13:22.300
Everyone.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.380
What kind of person would possibly have predicted this?

13:23.380 --> 13:25.060
Remember when he was elected president, Dan?

13:25.060 --> 13:27.140
We were meant to give him a chance.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.140
Yeah.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.140
You know?

13:29.140 --> 13:38.620
It's tough, I guess, to hear aspiring authoritarian dictator servers sad that they don't get to,

13:38.620 --> 13:41.660
you know, that their guy wasn't strong enough to get them to the point where they could

13:41.660 --> 13:42.660
be his servants.

13:42.660 --> 13:48.620
I was hoping that the boot I was licking was strong and powerful, and it turns out it was

13:48.620 --> 13:51.340
weak, ineffectual, and a grifter just like my boot.

13:51.340 --> 13:55.380
I can't believe that my tongue made it all the way through that boot.

13:55.380 --> 13:57.100
So quickly, too.

13:57.100 --> 14:00.020
How many licks does it take to get to the center of Trump's boot?

14:00.020 --> 14:01.780
I will say this about Harrison, though.

14:01.780 --> 14:02.780
What's that?

14:02.780 --> 14:06.980
Um, for all the, like, hey, Trump has failed kind of talk, he's a big man.

14:06.980 --> 14:07.980
He's a big man.

14:07.980 --> 14:09.900
He's big enough to admit that he was wrong.

14:09.900 --> 14:10.900
Okay.

14:10.900 --> 14:16.300
Although this clip is only 34 seconds long, and it ends with him saying, I wasn't actually

14:16.300 --> 14:17.300
wrong.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.300
Okay, well.

14:18.300 --> 14:24.660
We thought he had what it took to do what was necessary to save this country.

14:24.660 --> 14:35.900
And it would, I guess it would feel embarrassing if I cared about that sort of thing.

14:35.900 --> 14:41.500
I'm not too big to admit that we were wrong.

14:41.500 --> 14:42.620
We weren't wrong, really.

14:42.620 --> 14:43.620
He could have.

14:43.620 --> 14:44.620
He could have done it.

14:44.620 --> 14:45.620
He just didn't.

14:45.620 --> 14:46.620
He just didn't do it.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.180
He didn't do it.

14:48.180 --> 14:51.300
He didn't have what it takes.

14:51.300 --> 14:52.300
Wow.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.020
I'm big enough to admit we were wrong.

14:54.020 --> 14:55.020
Actually, nevermind.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.020
I am not.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.020
Nevermind.

14:57.020 --> 14:58.020
We weren't wrong.

14:58.020 --> 14:59.020
Indeed.

14:59.020 --> 15:00.020
I am not big enough to admit we were wrong.

15:00.020 --> 15:01.020
Hold on.

15:01.020 --> 15:02.020
Late breaking news.

15:02.020 --> 15:03.020
We weren't wrong.

15:03.020 --> 15:04.020
Excuse me, sir.

15:04.020 --> 15:05.460
Denial can only get to you in the cliff.

15:05.460 --> 15:07.340
It cannot get you to jump over it.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.340
Yeah.

15:08.340 --> 15:09.340
That's pretty amazing.

15:09.340 --> 15:10.340
That's.

15:10.340 --> 15:12.980
I'm a big enough man to admit I was wrong.

15:12.980 --> 15:13.980
Actually, I was right.

15:13.980 --> 15:14.980
Trump fucked up.

15:14.980 --> 15:21.840
I do like that he's completely missing the point of being a big enough man is the sense

15:21.840 --> 15:26.900
of like, I am an adult by immediately undercutting it.

15:26.900 --> 15:32.140
Well, and I think also, it's my experience that when you talk about like being big enough

15:32.140 --> 15:37.180
to admit you're wrong, that's usually the byproduct of like introspection and it's clear

15:37.180 --> 15:43.700
that this isn't something that has been wrestled with or like, huh, what was it that led us

15:43.700 --> 15:46.500
down the road to thinking that Trump was going to be our king?

15:46.500 --> 15:51.160
No, it's almost like he'd heard other people say I'm a big enough man to admit when I'm

15:51.160 --> 15:52.160
wrong a lot.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.820
Maybe his dad, who is debating.

15:53.820 --> 15:58.180
Yeah, yeah, this is supposed to be the thing that I say and then he walks it back because

15:58.180 --> 16:00.100
he doesn't understand it whatsoever.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.100
Yeah.

16:01.100 --> 16:04.300
So there's another thing that's going on in Info Wars right now, of course.

16:04.300 --> 16:09.500
Anybody who's listened to our shows aware of this, they're really mad at Q and QAnon.

16:09.500 --> 16:15.900
And so Harrison is also there and he has this expression that he keeps using and that is

16:15.900 --> 16:22.940
politics is war deferred, but that deferment no longer exists.

16:22.940 --> 16:23.940
Okay.

16:23.940 --> 16:25.780
We've never lied to you folks.

16:25.780 --> 16:31.460
We have never put a friendly face on something that was horrific.

16:31.460 --> 16:35.340
We have never told you to trust the plan that people were working behind the scenes that

16:35.340 --> 16:36.340
you needed to do nothing.

16:36.340 --> 16:37.340
Oh, really?

16:37.340 --> 16:42.660
We've always shot straight here at Info Wars, so that's what I'm going to try to do today.

16:42.660 --> 16:43.660
Really?

16:43.660 --> 16:53.740
I'm going to try to do it in a way that doesn't get me on a list of some sort because this

16:53.740 --> 16:55.620
is a brave new world.

16:55.620 --> 16:56.620
Yuck.

16:56.620 --> 17:02.140
This is a new situation that we are in.

17:02.140 --> 17:05.740
We've been discussing it this entire week, really ever since the sixth.

17:05.740 --> 17:06.740
Drink some coffee.

17:06.740 --> 17:07.740
Yeah.

17:07.740 --> 17:08.740
It is no longer safe to...

17:08.740 --> 17:09.740
Hurry it up.

17:09.740 --> 17:13.500
... express yourself believing that the First Amendment will protect you.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.220
He says, broadcasting lies.

17:15.220 --> 17:19.060
It's not the case anymore and we'll go through some major stories that show you that.

17:19.060 --> 17:25.140
I don't want to show this video, this is a rant Alex Jones went on yesterday that I

17:25.140 --> 17:32.620
think lays it out fairly well because this is a war now.

17:32.620 --> 17:42.840
If politics is war deferred, if politics is a replacement for war where people we elect

17:42.840 --> 17:52.320
do our fighting for us in the halls of government rather than us brawling it out in the streets,

17:52.320 --> 17:55.060
that is no longer the case.

17:55.060 --> 17:59.580
All right, so I guess it's time to brawl in the streets, Harrison.

17:59.580 --> 18:02.940
I don't like his understanding of politics very much.

18:02.940 --> 18:08.260
It can't be war deferred and also a replacement for war.

18:08.260 --> 18:09.800
It's a delaying tactic.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.980
If that's your description of democracy, we have a real problem.

18:13.980 --> 18:14.980
It's troubling.

18:14.980 --> 18:18.340
I think, again, this is just like him repeating things he's heard that do sound pretty good

18:18.340 --> 18:19.340
if you're not paying attention.

18:19.340 --> 18:20.340
Yeah, they do sound good.

18:20.340 --> 18:22.660
Yeah, they roll off you pretty okay.

18:22.660 --> 18:25.860
Politics is war deferred sounds like something someone strong would say.

18:25.860 --> 18:27.300
Now here's the thing that's really funny.

18:27.300 --> 18:33.220
He's introducing a report from Alex because Alex went on that rant about migrants and

18:33.220 --> 18:39.340
so he's going to play that, but what's really funny is that at the end of that rant that

18:39.340 --> 18:45.220
Alex did, he throws it to a Harrison Smith piece and so at the end of the video that

18:45.220 --> 18:50.340
Harrison plays, Alex references a Harrison Smith video and then there's a long silence

18:50.340 --> 18:52.020
or Harrison's like, oh God.

18:52.020 --> 18:54.580
Okay, so it's like an ouroboros of bullshit.

18:54.580 --> 18:57.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

18:57.020 --> 19:02.660
But this gets Harrison into thinking about how like, hey, if you're white and you're

19:02.660 --> 19:05.300
young, shit's going to be bad.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.300
If you're...

19:06.300 --> 19:07.300
Yeah, yeah.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.300
Calm down.

19:08.300 --> 19:09.300
Calm down.

19:09.300 --> 19:10.300
This is going to get really bad.

19:10.300 --> 19:11.300
Okay.

19:11.300 --> 19:14.660
But if you're like 50, you could just go out to the woods and wait it out.

19:14.660 --> 19:15.660
You'll be fine.

19:15.660 --> 19:16.660
All right.

19:16.660 --> 19:17.660
But your children.

19:17.660 --> 19:18.660
Okay.

19:18.660 --> 19:19.660
Oh, think of the children.

19:19.660 --> 19:20.660
Oh boy.

19:20.660 --> 19:24.420
If you're over 50 or whatever, you might be able to live the rest of your life off your

19:24.420 --> 19:30.580
meager retirement, enjoy it, have a nice little place in the mountains, watch the sunset,

19:30.580 --> 19:37.620
drink your wine, listen to your old music, but your children and your children's children

19:37.620 --> 19:45.520
are going to be a despised minority with no rights, no future, no ability to make anything

19:45.520 --> 19:51.220
of themselves robbed constantly and the money given to people who hate them in order to

19:51.220 --> 19:52.220
replace them.

19:52.220 --> 19:53.220
Okay.

19:53.220 --> 19:56.460
So you can't just ignore this anymore.

19:56.460 --> 19:59.300
And if you do, you're part of the problem.

19:59.300 --> 20:01.260
You need to be involved.

20:01.260 --> 20:05.500
You need to be aware and we need to fight.

20:05.500 --> 20:09.500
Not politically, literally.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.760
I'm not calling for violence.

20:10.760 --> 20:16.260
I'm letting you know violence is upon us implemented through the state.

20:16.260 --> 20:19.060
So you're surgically.

20:19.060 --> 20:24.180
So there seems to me to be very little difference between that mentality that Harrison is expressing

20:24.180 --> 20:29.260
and the tiki torch wielding Nazis at the unite the right rally chanting Jews will not replace

20:29.260 --> 20:30.260
us.

20:30.260 --> 20:31.260
Yeah.

20:31.260 --> 20:32.260
I'm going to go with zero difference.

20:32.260 --> 20:33.260
I listened to info Wars a lot.

20:33.260 --> 20:37.740
In my perspective, that was a very explicit overt plea to white nationalism to the point

20:37.740 --> 20:40.300
where I was shocked by how blunt it was.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.740
I was wondering what was up here.

20:41.740 --> 20:46.460
So I went to the American journal page on band.video and there's some pretty mask off

20:46.460 --> 20:47.980
stuff going on over there.

20:47.980 --> 20:48.980
That doesn't surprise me.

20:48.980 --> 20:52.900
Perhaps the most telling video title you'll immediately be confronted by is from January

20:52.900 --> 20:57.480
21st titled quote, stop white genocide.

20:57.480 --> 21:02.500
That is an intensely direct title for a video and the description really says it all quote

21:02.500 --> 21:06.820
Harrison Smith explains why migration is the choice weapon of the elite when trying to

21:06.820 --> 21:08.900
dominate and destroy a population.

21:08.900 --> 21:09.900
Okay.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.280
Oh boy.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.940
It's tough to be more clear than this.

21:12.940 --> 21:17.140
Harrison Smith is explicitly disseminating white nationalist narratives on the info Wars

21:17.140 --> 21:21.340
morning show, which I recall, if I recall correctly, is supposed to be almost entirely

21:21.340 --> 21:22.340
phone calls.

21:22.340 --> 21:24.620
Yeah, I do remember that being the plan.

21:24.620 --> 21:28.500
This is not something that's just like tacitly supported by Alex by virtue of the fact that

21:28.500 --> 21:30.180
it's on his network.

21:30.180 --> 21:34.820
It's just a more explicit recitation of the talking points that Alex himself spouts constantly.

21:34.820 --> 21:35.820
Yeah.

21:35.820 --> 21:37.860
It's almost like Alex hired Steve Doocy.

21:37.860 --> 21:41.900
I didn't want to just point out that Harrison put out a video decrying his fears about white

21:41.900 --> 21:44.540
genocide and then say that the work was done.

21:44.540 --> 21:47.780
There are far too many lazy commentators who will react to titles of things without looking

21:47.780 --> 21:51.100
at the body of the piece and I strive not to fall into that trap.

21:51.100 --> 21:52.620
So I watched the video.

21:52.620 --> 21:56.060
The structure that Harrison is going for is to make the argument that the treatment of

21:56.060 --> 21:59.740
white Europeans in the United States is the same as the treatment of the Uyghur people

21:59.740 --> 22:03.380
by the Chinese government, and if people are comfortable with saying that the treatment

22:03.380 --> 22:07.380
of the Uyghurs could be called genocide, then Harrison's well within his rights to claim

22:07.380 --> 22:11.380
that white people are the target of a genocide here and in Europe.

22:11.380 --> 22:12.380
Uh.

22:12.380 --> 22:13.380
Right.

22:13.380 --> 22:16.780
In order to bolster this claim, Harrison does some pretty predictable false equivalencies.

22:16.780 --> 22:20.220
For instance, he mentions that the Chinese government is accused of forcing Uyghurs to

22:20.220 --> 22:23.500
be sterilized or be required to take birth control.

22:23.500 --> 22:27.220
Harrison then claims that this is the same as the U.S. offering people birth control

22:27.220 --> 22:31.500
and that somehow decades of propaganda are responsible for people making family planning

22:31.500 --> 22:32.500
choices.

22:32.500 --> 22:33.500
Yeah, that sounds right.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.980
This is a completely insane false equivalence and I don't see a good way for Harrison to

22:36.980 --> 22:39.500
defend that flimsy ass plank in his argument.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.500
So he doesn't.

22:40.500 --> 22:41.500
He just says it.

22:41.500 --> 22:47.700
No, I don't think there's any way not to hear him say this and think what you're saying

22:47.700 --> 22:52.680
is white men are going to be treated like white men have treated everybody else in this

22:52.680 --> 22:55.860
country and that's worthy of killing everyone.

22:55.860 --> 22:56.860
Hmm?

22:56.860 --> 22:57.860
Maybe?

22:57.860 --> 22:58.860
Yeah.

22:58.860 --> 23:02.060
So then, Harrison gets to the point in the video where the argument pivots to immigration

23:02.060 --> 23:06.880
because at this point, you know, at the beginning he's laying out this groundwork and he's saying

23:06.880 --> 23:09.460
that it's the same as the treatment of the Uyghurs.

23:09.460 --> 23:10.460
Sure.

23:10.460 --> 23:11.460
Nonsense.

23:11.460 --> 23:12.460
Naturally.

23:12.460 --> 23:14.820
Harrison's primary source that he's reading from is a July 4th article that was posted

23:14.820 --> 23:16.620
on NPR.

23:16.620 --> 23:22.500
Here Harrison discusses his contention that white people are being the subject of genocide.

23:22.500 --> 23:27.500
As the government, and get this, and if this isn't genocide, I don't know what is.

23:27.500 --> 23:32.140
The government has brought millions of Han Chinese settlers into the region with promises

23:32.140 --> 23:35.020
of high salary, jobs, and free housing.

23:35.020 --> 23:43.300
My God, ethnic migrants, economic migrants coming into a region for high paying jobs?

23:43.300 --> 23:46.300
That's genocide, obviously, when it's in China.

23:46.300 --> 23:47.300
What about here?

23:47.300 --> 23:48.300
It's diversity here.

23:48.300 --> 23:49.980
You have to understand the distinction, folks.

23:49.980 --> 23:51.900
Do you support giving First Nations land back?

23:51.900 --> 23:55.560
When happening to you, it's a good thing.

23:55.560 --> 23:56.780
It's diversity.

23:56.780 --> 23:57.780
It's our strength.

23:57.780 --> 23:58.780
It's what we need.

23:58.780 --> 24:04.300
When it's happening to Uyghur Muslims in China, it's genocide, by God.

24:04.300 --> 24:05.300
What about white people?

24:05.300 --> 24:06.300
This is what people...

24:06.300 --> 24:07.300
I don't know.

24:07.300 --> 24:08.300
I mean...

24:08.300 --> 24:09.300
Hello.

24:09.300 --> 24:10.300
Hello.

24:10.300 --> 24:11.300
Come on.

24:11.300 --> 24:12.300
Wake up, dammit.

24:12.300 --> 24:13.300
So a couple of important points here.

24:13.300 --> 24:18.040
The first is that the guy who was interviewed by NPR does not say that the form of immigration

24:18.040 --> 24:20.680
that Harrison is discussing is genocide.

24:20.680 --> 24:24.980
He says that it's a part of a, quote, policy of ethno-racial domination, which is still

24:24.980 --> 24:26.580
bad, but it's not the same thing.

24:26.580 --> 24:31.740
Harrison stops reading right before the guy says, quote, the reason why this has changed,

24:31.740 --> 24:35.980
we do need to probably call it a genocide, is quite simply because the evidence now for

24:35.980 --> 24:40.900
the first time very specifically meets one of the five criteria set forth by the UN Convention

24:40.900 --> 24:44.980
for the Punishment and Prevention of the Crime of Genocide from 1948, which specifically

24:44.980 --> 24:47.400
says the suppression of birth.

24:47.400 --> 24:51.980
This guy is clearly expressing that bringing the Han Chinese to replace Uyghur workers

24:51.980 --> 24:54.160
doesn't meet the definition of genocide.

24:54.160 --> 24:59.300
But now that there's evidence of birth suppression, that does meet the definition according to

24:59.300 --> 25:00.300
this guy.

25:00.300 --> 25:01.300
Yeah.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.880
Harrison is completely misrepresenting this researcher's words because his agenda is to

25:03.880 --> 25:07.600
yell about immigration to the United States and stress white aggrievement, not to cover

25:07.600 --> 25:11.480
any of these issues in a meaningful way that helps the audience better understand the world

25:11.480 --> 25:15.160
and hopefully pushes public opinion towards better policy preferences.

25:15.160 --> 25:18.820
He's trying to make white people scared of non-white people, and he's trying to use the

25:18.820 --> 25:23.660
prop of the Chinese state oppression in order to justify his shoddy arguments.

25:23.660 --> 25:27.380
None of the complaints that Harrison brings up here rise to the level of meeting the UN

25:27.380 --> 25:32.060
definition of genocide, which is the standard of the conversation as presented in his primary

25:32.060 --> 25:33.380
source.

25:33.380 --> 25:38.220
Article 2 of the UN Convention lays out the five acts that constitute genocide, and what

25:38.220 --> 25:42.460
makes it an even more difficult argument for Harrison to make is that it says, quote, genocide

25:42.460 --> 25:47.100
means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part,

25:47.100 --> 25:50.380
a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group.

25:50.380 --> 25:54.420
The word intent is going to be a really serious problem for Harrison.

25:54.420 --> 25:58.560
The argument he's setting out to make requires that he somehow demonstrate that immigration

25:58.560 --> 26:02.780
of non-white people into the United States is being done with the intention of destroying

26:02.780 --> 26:05.080
in whole or in part white people.

26:05.080 --> 26:08.820
That's going to be really impossible for him to do without slipping into explicit white

26:08.820 --> 26:11.460
supremacist or neo-Nazi conspiracy theories.

26:11.460 --> 26:20.940
I mean, I would just have to say, manifest destiny, and if you want to start pulling

26:20.940 --> 26:25.940
some shit, then fine, start giving land back to the First Nations.

26:25.940 --> 26:30.400
Otherwise shut the fuck up, because these are the people who celebrate manifest destiny

26:30.400 --> 26:32.460
as the greatest thing that's ever happened.

26:32.460 --> 26:36.140
Well, it had something to do with God telling.

26:36.140 --> 26:40.500
So Harrison goes on to complain some more in this piece.

26:40.500 --> 26:45.520
We're taking a little side tour into his Stop White Genocide video, so this isn't from the

26:45.520 --> 26:51.800
inauguration day, but I got really sort of curious when he was talking about your ancestors

26:51.800 --> 26:57.060
being a hated minority, and all of that, it was like, this seems like code, and I wanted

26:57.060 --> 27:00.780
to understand a little better, and then I found this Stop White Genocide piece, and

27:00.780 --> 27:02.780
I was like, holy shit.

27:02.780 --> 27:06.500
The United Nations Convention for the Punishment and Prevention of the Crime of Genocide from

27:06.500 --> 27:18.660
1948 specifies the suppression of birth as one of the primary attributes of a genocide.

27:18.660 --> 27:26.700
Now, if I was some sort of insane conspiracy theorist, I might point to the ongoing attempt

27:26.700 --> 27:32.540
by many, many mainstream outlets to suppress the birth rate of white Americans.

27:32.540 --> 27:34.480
Say white people don't have children.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.980
You shouldn't have children, white people.

27:36.980 --> 27:38.100
It goes on and on and on.

27:38.100 --> 27:41.460
We've seen this headline over and over again, but that's not genocide.

27:41.460 --> 27:44.640
That's a good thing, because remember, white people bad.

27:44.640 --> 27:47.660
I don't think that makes Harrison sound like a conspiracy theorist.

27:47.660 --> 27:49.800
I think it makes him sound like a flagrant racist.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.460
That's exactly what it makes him sound like.

27:51.460 --> 27:54.900
Harrison Smith isn't seeing the media constantly saying that white people shouldn't have kids

27:54.900 --> 27:56.260
because they're not.

27:56.260 --> 27:59.900
He's seeing things like interracial couples represented in commercials and sitcoms, and

27:59.900 --> 28:03.880
he's experiencing that as an attempt to say that white people shouldn't just reproduce

28:03.880 --> 28:05.100
with each other.

28:05.100 --> 28:09.020
I decided to check out what happens when you Google white people shouldn't have kids.

28:09.020 --> 28:12.980
Looking for some headlines, looking for some digging around.

28:12.980 --> 28:22.260
Can I guess, just real quick, you are going to find roughly 10,000 reactionary right-wing

28:22.260 --> 28:26.140
articles about this, and very few, if any.

28:26.140 --> 28:27.140
Not so much.

28:27.140 --> 28:30.660
I found the first eight results are just about raising children who are capable of talking

28:30.660 --> 28:31.660
about race issues.

28:31.660 --> 28:32.660
Oh, that's nice.

28:32.660 --> 28:34.500
I don't say that white people shouldn't have kids.

28:34.500 --> 28:38.740
The ninth result is a 2017 article out of The Independent titled, quote, seven reasons

28:38.740 --> 28:40.860
people shouldn't have children according to science.

28:40.860 --> 28:43.260
That has nothing to do with white people not having kids.

28:43.260 --> 28:47.100
It's more of an exploration of the research into things like changing friendships after

28:47.100 --> 28:51.300
one person has a kid and the other doesn't, or how according to one poll, quote, non-parents

28:51.300 --> 28:54.020
tend to lead healthier lifestyles than parents.

28:54.020 --> 28:57.220
Was that the one, okay, that was 2017, right?

28:57.220 --> 28:58.220
Yeah.

28:58.220 --> 29:02.540
I was interviewed for that one, and they rejected mine, which was white people don't have kids.

29:02.540 --> 29:03.540
Oh.

29:03.540 --> 29:04.540
Yeah.

29:04.540 --> 29:05.540
Maybe Harrison got the early version.

29:05.540 --> 29:08.300
Maybe Harrison accidentally talked to that one.

29:08.300 --> 29:11.740
Then the results go back to being about, you know, people being able to talk about race

29:11.740 --> 29:13.220
with children.

29:13.220 --> 29:18.220
The closest thing that gets really, like, the closest to really complex racial issues

29:18.220 --> 29:22.180
that you find is that there's a couple articles about, like, the dynamics of adoption.

29:22.180 --> 29:27.300
Yeah, trans adoption is a real huge, yeah.

29:27.300 --> 29:30.300
You see some articles discussing that, but that's not what Harrison's talking about.

29:30.300 --> 29:31.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:31.300 --> 29:35.340
You can't tell page seven of the search results to actually even find an article that's actually

29:35.340 --> 29:39.620
about people advocating that people not have children, and again, it's not race-based.

29:39.620 --> 29:44.500
It's a 2019 editorial piece on the BBC about a group called the Antinatalists, who just

29:44.500 --> 29:45.940
want no one to have kids.

29:45.940 --> 29:46.940
Yeah, well.

29:46.940 --> 29:50.780
And there's also the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement there, but that's not racially based

29:50.780 --> 29:51.780
either.

29:51.780 --> 29:58.460
I assume Harrison also looked up a lot of New York Times articles and the like from

29:58.460 --> 30:07.340
anywhere between 1878 and 1939, whenever everyone was advocating for black people to voluntarily

30:07.340 --> 30:08.940
not have children ever again?

30:08.940 --> 30:09.940
Nah.

30:09.940 --> 30:10.940
Oh, okay.

30:10.940 --> 30:11.940
I don't know.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.180
I would like some citations.

30:13.180 --> 30:15.220
I don't think that Harrison's making a serious point here.

30:15.220 --> 30:18.860
I think this is just a white identity talking point being presented as if it represents

30:18.860 --> 30:19.860
reality.

30:19.860 --> 30:20.860
Totally.

30:20.860 --> 30:21.860
And that's fucking gross.

30:21.860 --> 30:22.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:22.860 --> 30:29.460
And I would like more ideas, I would like concrete examples of what white men are going

30:29.460 --> 30:33.620
to face, young white men are going to face, and I would like him to put those up on a

30:33.620 --> 30:38.980
wall somewhere, just so we can refer back to them every time one of them occurs, I imagine.

30:38.980 --> 30:45.180
I also just resent when people like this present this idea, like, we've seen all the hundred

30:45.180 --> 30:47.900
articles telling white people not to have kids.

30:47.900 --> 30:48.900
I haven't.

30:48.900 --> 30:49.900
Name one.

30:49.900 --> 30:50.900
Yeah.

30:50.900 --> 30:51.900
Pick one.

30:51.900 --> 30:52.900
Yeah.

30:52.900 --> 30:55.540
And also, it can't be something that's clearly satire.

30:55.540 --> 30:56.540
Yeah.

30:56.540 --> 30:58.780
And it can't be something that you said.

30:58.780 --> 31:02.540
Okay, if it's McSweeney's or me, then you don't get to reference it.

31:02.540 --> 31:06.700
So like I said, this entire argument really just hinges on Harrison trying to make the

31:06.700 --> 31:13.300
treatment of white people be equivalent to the Uyghur and other minority treatment in

31:13.300 --> 31:14.300
China.

31:14.300 --> 31:15.300
Sure.

31:15.300 --> 31:19.860
I want to continue to lay out the case for white genocide, I guess, is what I'm doing

31:19.860 --> 31:25.860
here, because after all, I'm one of these crazy conspiracy theorists that thinks genocide

31:25.860 --> 31:26.860
is bad.

31:26.860 --> 31:27.860
I agree.

31:27.860 --> 31:28.860
I know.

31:28.860 --> 31:30.300
It's just, it's just nutty.

31:30.300 --> 31:35.540
I have this weird consistency where I think the genocide of the Uyghur people in China

31:35.540 --> 31:41.940
is bad, and I think the genocide of European people in Europe is also bad.

31:41.940 --> 31:49.660
I don't understand the complex geography that goes into determining whether one is

31:49.660 --> 31:50.660
bad or not.

31:50.660 --> 31:52.780
I just, I'm just such a simple guy.

31:52.780 --> 31:58.660
To me, genocide equals bad, and I just don't have the college thinking, the university

31:58.660 --> 32:03.280
brain that's necessary to understand why it's good when it's against white people and bad

32:03.280 --> 32:04.820
when it's against the Uyghur minority.

32:04.820 --> 32:07.300
I just, I just am too dumb, I guess.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.300
I don't know.

32:08.300 --> 32:10.060
I don't think Harrison is too stupid.

32:10.060 --> 32:14.100
His problem isn't stupidity or not understanding, it's that he's outrageously racist, and he's

32:14.100 --> 32:18.040
also unfortunately smart enough to know that it's bad for business to just admit that and

32:18.040 --> 32:19.040
live openly.

32:19.040 --> 32:22.940
That's why he has to make these strained comparisons and false equivalencies to try

32:22.940 --> 32:26.820
to pretend that the experience of being white in the United States or in Europe is in any

32:26.820 --> 32:29.100
way comparable to being Uyghur in China.

32:29.100 --> 32:32.940
That's a ludicrous proposition, and it's why he has to pretend that allegations of

32:32.940 --> 32:38.440
forced sterilization in China are the same as the availability of birth control here.

32:38.440 --> 32:41.420
Any right thinking person would hear that argument and recognize pretty quickly how

32:41.420 --> 32:44.800
stupid it is, but that's because it's a crypto argument.

32:44.800 --> 32:48.580
The argument or the false equivalence doesn't actually exist to be taken seriously.

32:48.580 --> 32:52.060
It's only there because Harrison knows he can't come out and express his true white

32:52.060 --> 32:55.260
nationalist positions without consequences.

32:55.260 --> 32:59.380
I wouldn't say that genocide against Uyghurs is bad and genocide against white people is

32:59.380 --> 33:00.380
good.

33:00.380 --> 33:04.100
I would contest Harrison's point that the situations each group are facing are in any

33:04.100 --> 33:08.220
way comparable, and that's where Harrison's argument would completely fall apart.

33:08.220 --> 33:12.660
I know that because I was listening to a twenty minute video where he's trying to defend

33:12.660 --> 33:16.700
that premise and he's failing embarrassingly and really letting his racism show.

33:16.700 --> 33:20.580
But that said, the Lonely Shepherd by Zamfir slaps.

33:20.580 --> 33:21.580
Okay.

33:21.580 --> 33:22.580
All right.

33:22.580 --> 33:23.580
All right.

33:23.580 --> 33:24.580
Okay.

33:24.580 --> 33:25.580
The king of the pan flute.

33:25.580 --> 33:26.580
Oh.

33:26.580 --> 33:31.580
Harrison does have a couple of decent music choices.

33:31.580 --> 33:32.580
Okay.

33:32.580 --> 33:36.980
He has some good cues that I haven't heard from other Infowars shows, including the Lonely

33:36.980 --> 33:37.980
Shepherd.

33:37.980 --> 33:38.980
Yeah.

33:38.980 --> 33:39.980
I mean I would-

33:39.980 --> 33:40.980
I guess it's the morning show.

33:40.980 --> 33:41.980
You gotta be a little chiller.

33:41.980 --> 33:42.980
Yeah.

33:42.980 --> 33:43.980
That pan flute really does-

33:43.980 --> 33:44.980
That wakes you up.

33:44.980 --> 33:50.700
That Zamfir branded himself the king of the pan flute as if it was a crowded space.

33:50.700 --> 33:52.740
Pop culture pan flutist.

33:52.740 --> 33:57.180
I think that's why you have to brand yourself as a bombastic something, otherwise people

33:57.180 --> 34:00.620
aren't gonna be like, oh this guy's really good at the pan flute.

34:00.620 --> 34:01.900
He's the king of the pan flute.

34:01.900 --> 34:04.300
It's like Chuck Mangione, the king of the flugelhorn.

34:04.300 --> 34:06.380
He is the king of the flugelhorn, that's true.

34:06.380 --> 34:07.500
No one's gonna fuck with his title.

34:07.500 --> 34:08.500
He's not wrong.

34:08.500 --> 34:09.500
No.

34:09.500 --> 34:10.500
He's not wrong.

34:10.500 --> 34:13.140
The Children of Sanchez, such a good song.

34:13.140 --> 34:14.140
Good soundtrack.

34:14.140 --> 34:15.140
Alright.

34:15.140 --> 34:16.140
Anyway.

34:16.140 --> 34:20.460
Harrison gets to going about, eh, he just keeps going.

34:20.460 --> 34:21.460
Yeah.

34:21.460 --> 34:24.740
The 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which

34:24.740 --> 34:29.860
has been ratified by at least 149 countries, including China, defines genocide as any of

34:29.860 --> 34:36.820
these acts committed with the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.

34:36.820 --> 34:40.820
Killing its members, causing them seriously bodily or mental harm.

34:40.820 --> 34:49.820
By the way, vast, vast majority of suicides, vast majority of medication for depression,

34:49.820 --> 34:51.940
is all on white people.

34:51.940 --> 34:54.980
But that's a good thing because white people are evil.

34:54.980 --> 34:59.460
So even assuming that everything Harrison just said is true from a statistical perspective,

34:59.460 --> 35:03.220
it's still meaningless in terms of his argument that there's a white genocide going on.

35:03.220 --> 35:08.500
Again, he's using this 1948 UN definition of genocide that includes the word intent

35:08.500 --> 35:10.980
as a really important element of the definition.

35:10.980 --> 35:14.380
I mean, Harrison works for Infowars, so he probably shouldn't even care what the UN thinks

35:14.380 --> 35:18.060
about the subject, but he's operating off that definition, so that's the conversation

35:18.060 --> 35:19.500
that's being had.

35:19.500 --> 35:24.100
In order for his argument to carry any weight, Harrison is going to have to demonstrate and

35:24.100 --> 35:25.700
prove the following.

35:25.700 --> 35:30.500
One, that there are in fact disproportionate medication and suicide rates between races

35:30.500 --> 35:35.820
that cannot be explained by other factors, like income inequality or access to healthcare.

35:35.820 --> 35:40.540
Two, that this is the result of a concerted plan by some group as an attempt to destroy

35:40.540 --> 35:42.060
white people.

35:42.060 --> 35:44.700
Harrison can't even come close to either of these.

35:44.700 --> 35:48.540
The best he can do is suggest that mental health practices like psychiatric medication

35:48.540 --> 35:52.260
are an attempt to kill off white people, and suggest that that's the way it is because

35:52.260 --> 35:54.040
someone's out to get white people.

35:54.040 --> 35:57.100
That's all he can do, because there is no argument here.

35:57.100 --> 36:00.680
There's only an appeal to emotion, only an appeal to fear.

36:00.680 --> 36:04.700
This is an attempt to give racist people listening a way to express their racism without sounding

36:04.700 --> 36:05.700
racist.

36:05.700 --> 36:06.700
It's honestly pretty pathetic.

36:06.700 --> 36:07.700
Yeah.

36:07.700 --> 36:11.820
Also, a recent paper from the Division of Vital Statistics out of the CDC reflects that

36:11.820 --> 36:17.220
in 2017, once you adjust for population, the group with by far the highest rate of suicide

36:17.220 --> 36:20.660
is non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native women.

36:20.660 --> 36:22.660
I eagerly await Harrison's coverage of that.

36:22.660 --> 36:24.340
Yeah, I would be interested to hear that.

36:24.340 --> 36:27.100
Oh, I know, I wouldn't be interested to hear that.

36:27.100 --> 36:31.480
So in order to bolster his claims that there's a white genocide going on, Harrison brings

36:31.480 --> 36:33.140
up the case of Ireland.

36:33.140 --> 36:36.960
He seems to think that their entire population is going to be replaced with immigrants because

36:36.960 --> 36:40.880
of a need to do so in order to make their pension system work.

36:40.880 --> 36:46.100
Here's the profoundly racist and idiotic way that his segment on white genocide ends, and

36:46.100 --> 36:50.540
I will explain to you on the other side why this is very dumb.

36:50.540 --> 36:52.740
I don't like what's happening to the Uyghurs in China.

36:52.740 --> 36:59.220
We should be defending these people who are being systematically eradicated by their governmental

36:59.220 --> 37:00.220
organizations.

37:00.220 --> 37:05.980
And on the other hand, I don't want the people of Ireland to be systematically eliminated

37:05.980 --> 37:10.280
by their super state governmental organization.

37:10.280 --> 37:15.300
I don't think the pension system is worth replacing every single person in your country

37:15.300 --> 37:18.180
with a foreigner.

37:18.180 --> 37:19.500
There's plenty to go around.

37:19.500 --> 37:25.340
Hell, there's more, there's more Bangladeshis in a single district of a single city of that

37:25.340 --> 37:28.060
country than there are in the entire nation of Ireland.

37:28.060 --> 37:32.240
So maybe we can help out Ireland, maybe we can help increase the birth rates, maybe we

37:32.240 --> 37:37.220
can stop this genocide, at least in Ireland, and then maybe we can expand that to the rest

37:37.220 --> 37:41.660
of the world and recognize that white people are a global minority, the least population

37:41.660 --> 37:47.340
out of any racial division, if you want to take the big ones, Asian, black, whatever.

37:47.340 --> 37:51.260
Whites are the smallest, and they're being genocided, and that's the headline.

37:51.260 --> 37:52.700
Stop white genocide.

37:52.700 --> 37:57.140
So Harrison is working off a primary source that's an article in the Independent out of

37:57.140 --> 37:58.140
Ireland.

37:58.140 --> 38:01.700
The headline of the article is, quote, Ireland needs four million migrants to sustain state

38:01.700 --> 38:03.060
pension system.

38:03.060 --> 38:06.540
Harrison takes that information and combines it with the fact that Ireland's population

38:06.540 --> 38:10.860
is only like five million, so that must mean that they want to replace everyone with immigrants

38:10.860 --> 38:12.180
to save the pension system.

38:12.180 --> 38:13.880
Yeah, that sounds like the Irish.

38:13.880 --> 38:18.300
The problem is that Harrison didn't do any work, like even reading the article.

38:18.300 --> 38:22.140
The first thing that jumps out at you if you do read the article is that the idea that

38:22.140 --> 38:25.820
the country needed four million migrants to make the pension system work was something

38:25.820 --> 38:30.420
that was used as an illustration of the problem the country was facing regarding having an

38:30.420 --> 38:36.140
aging population and meeting the pensions, in a meeting of the Pensions Committee.

38:36.140 --> 38:39.540
It wasn't being suggested as the plan to fix the pension system.

38:39.540 --> 38:44.380
They were saying that by 2051 they would need four million new people paying into the system

38:44.380 --> 38:48.500
to balance out all the people over 65 drawing from it.

38:48.500 --> 38:52.700
If Harrison wasn't such a dopey racist fuck, he would have kept reading to the part of

38:52.700 --> 38:56.740
the article where it says, quote, but the statistician and commission members say it's

38:56.740 --> 39:01.480
unlikely that net inward migration will reverse the current trends, and some migrants would

39:01.480 --> 39:04.020
become pensioners themselves.

39:04.020 --> 39:07.860
This article is about a discussion of why this wouldn't be a solid plan to fix the

39:07.860 --> 39:12.180
pension system, because if that were the only approach taken, you'd end up creating more

39:12.180 --> 39:15.160
net problems for the pension system than you fix.

39:15.160 --> 39:20.280
The article goes on to say, quote, Irish fiscal advisory council chair Sebastian Barnes said

39:20.280 --> 39:25.580
tax and spending would have to adjust to fund pensions while pension age would need to rise.

39:25.580 --> 39:28.700
Social protection minister Heather Humphreys spoke at the first meeting and made it clear

39:28.700 --> 39:33.100
that a reduction in the amount of state pension was not to be considered.

39:33.100 --> 39:36.820
This article is not about Ireland bringing in four million migrants to fix the pension

39:36.820 --> 39:41.060
system, but the headline is written in such a way that it's easy to use it that way.

39:41.060 --> 39:44.980
The four million number is used as an illustration of the imbalance that will exist between those

39:44.980 --> 39:49.020
paying into the system and those drawing from it, but because the headline is poorly written

39:49.020 --> 39:53.760
and because Harrison's a lazy craven racist, this article can be used to justify an argument

39:53.760 --> 39:58.620
that Ireland is engaging in white genocide in order to save its pension system.

39:58.620 --> 40:00.500
Harrison knows what he's doing.

40:00.500 --> 40:03.900
He knows that this article isn't about bringing in four million migrants to Ireland, but he

40:03.900 --> 40:07.960
also knows that because it looks like it is, he can mislead his audience into thinking

40:07.960 --> 40:11.740
that it is and hide his racist agenda behind that misrepresentation.

40:11.740 --> 40:16.100
Anyway, that's the end of our side tour through Harrison Smith's piece on white genocide.

40:16.100 --> 40:20.580
I can say with a fair amount of confidence that this special report was quite possibly

40:20.580 --> 40:26.340
the most transparent and most poorly argued racism I've ever seen on Infowars.

40:26.340 --> 40:30.020
It's the racism equivalent of Harrison saying that the capital had fallen and patriots were

40:30.020 --> 40:32.020
in charge on January 6th.

40:32.020 --> 40:33.900
He's not hiding what he is.

40:33.900 --> 40:34.900
Yeah.

40:34.900 --> 40:35.900
He is a fucking...

40:35.900 --> 40:36.900
Yeah, this is...

40:36.900 --> 40:42.380
Because what is he saying whenever he says we can stop the genocide of Ireland is just

40:42.380 --> 40:48.220
we can make sure that Ireland remains a white nation, and then we can save everybody else.

40:48.220 --> 40:54.820
So Europeans for European nations, Africans for African nations, Chinese people for China,

40:54.820 --> 40:57.500
and no mixing at all.

40:57.500 --> 41:01.460
And the primary source that he's working off of for this article is a headline that he's

41:01.460 --> 41:04.660
misrepresenting in a way to use as a racist cudgel.

41:04.660 --> 41:05.660
Totally.

41:05.660 --> 41:06.660
Like, it's outrageous.

41:06.660 --> 41:07.660
Yeah.

41:07.660 --> 41:15.460
I mean, it's to be expected on some level, but it's pretty...

41:15.460 --> 41:21.060
It's like using story math problems as like, okay, if the migrant caravan is racing towards

41:21.060 --> 41:24.980
the border at 60 miles an hour, but the white nationalists are going towards the border

41:24.980 --> 41:28.980
from the opposite direction at 50 miles an hour, then the white people will be exterminated.

41:28.980 --> 41:29.980
I don't like this quiz.

41:29.980 --> 41:30.980
Bad quiz.

41:30.980 --> 41:33.420
Yeah, it is a bad quiz.

41:33.420 --> 41:37.980
I started to wonder about this, and one of the things that I think is interesting is

41:37.980 --> 41:42.140
that like, yeah, I mean, a lot of the same themes are exactly the same as what Alex talks

41:42.140 --> 41:44.360
about, but just more crypto.

41:44.360 --> 41:50.460
Like Alex is way, way less close to the edge, let's say, than Harrison, because he knows

41:50.460 --> 41:54.460
that there's consequences for being too overtly racist.

41:54.460 --> 41:56.020
People will treat you in a certain way.

41:56.020 --> 42:00.700
He'll lose his ability to argue, oh, everyone says I'm a racist, they all lie about me,

42:00.700 --> 42:01.700
that kind of shit.

42:01.700 --> 42:06.740
I just wonder, you know, it makes me feel like there's two possible dynamics, and one

42:06.740 --> 42:13.180
is that like Alex is thinking, fuck it, let Harrison do a show that's extreme as hell.

42:13.180 --> 42:14.420
Test the white nationalist water.

42:14.420 --> 42:17.020
Yeah, let's see if that's a tap market that we can tap.

42:17.020 --> 42:18.980
Is anybody going to punish us for this?

42:18.980 --> 42:25.360
Or is it the case that Alex has run out of fucking steam to the point where a bigot like

42:25.360 --> 42:30.460
Harrison is taking over, or not taking over the whole thing, but like he has his own show

42:30.460 --> 42:33.580
and he's like, I'm going to speak to you fucking freely, I don't care, who else are you going

42:33.580 --> 42:34.580
to get to host a show?

42:34.580 --> 42:36.100
You need to sell your dumb pills.

42:36.100 --> 42:37.100
That's fair.

42:37.100 --> 42:41.700
I don't know, it's outrageous though, like I think that Harrison might be a much bigger

42:41.700 --> 42:43.660
problem than he appears.

42:43.660 --> 42:49.080
I mean, Harrison isn't even smart enough to do the dumbest, easiest thing that you can

42:49.080 --> 42:54.360
possibly do, which is immediately do what Alex does after saying something that's explicitly

42:54.360 --> 42:59.020
white nationalist and say, now you know me, I don't care about white, black, Hispanic

42:59.020 --> 43:00.020
or whatever.

43:00.020 --> 43:03.660
He doesn't even bother to do that cop out.

43:03.660 --> 43:04.660
No.

43:04.660 --> 43:05.660
What an asshole.

43:05.660 --> 43:06.660
Because I think he's speaking.

43:06.660 --> 43:07.660
He's just a white nationalist, yeah.

43:07.660 --> 43:08.660
Speaking freely.

43:08.660 --> 43:09.660
Yeah.

43:09.660 --> 43:10.660
So anyway, now we jump back to inauguration day.

43:10.660 --> 43:11.660
Sure.

43:11.660 --> 43:14.020
Sorry to take that side tour, but I felt like it was important.

43:14.020 --> 43:15.020
It was a good detour.

43:15.020 --> 43:16.020
Does that...

43:16.020 --> 43:17.780
You got to know when the whites are coming.

43:17.780 --> 43:21.940
Well, I mean, I really felt like that was something...

43:21.940 --> 43:23.580
That's my argument for white genocide.

43:23.580 --> 43:26.060
You got to know when they're coming.

43:26.060 --> 43:31.620
I felt like that was something that was behind the clip of him talking about your children

43:31.620 --> 43:32.620
will be hated minorities.

43:32.620 --> 43:33.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:33.620 --> 43:34.620
Look how that is.

43:34.620 --> 43:38.540
I was not wrong to suspect that this is the kind of thing you talk about.

43:38.540 --> 43:39.540
Yeah.

43:39.540 --> 43:43.300
And now we get back to the 20th and this is a scary thought.

43:43.300 --> 43:45.460
So we know how fake the news is.

43:45.460 --> 43:48.340
Imagine how fake history is.

43:48.340 --> 43:50.700
You see this play out in real time.

43:50.700 --> 43:55.020
We see the truth with our own eyes and then we hear the lies about it.

43:55.020 --> 43:56.180
We see the truth of the past.

43:56.180 --> 43:57.500
Head back to us.

43:57.500 --> 43:59.580
Imagine how false history is.

43:59.580 --> 44:01.100
That is so scary.

44:01.100 --> 44:06.780
That mentality is so scary, especially considering a week ago we had Alex presenting a completely

44:06.780 --> 44:09.980
false version of Hitler's rise to power.

44:09.980 --> 44:15.940
InfoWars does so much historical revisionism surrounding very serious issues.

44:15.940 --> 44:21.860
You know, hey, we've created an alternative reality for us to live in and we say that

44:21.860 --> 44:23.860
everybody else is lying.

44:23.860 --> 44:27.140
Can you imagine how much more lies are going on with history?

44:27.140 --> 44:28.140
Yeah.

44:28.140 --> 44:29.140
It's fucked up.

44:29.140 --> 44:31.820
You're, you're basically, yeah, you're, you're absolutely right.

44:31.820 --> 44:35.220
Like, hey, we've defeated reality in the present.

44:35.220 --> 44:38.900
Our only way to go now is the past unless somebody invents a time machine.

44:38.900 --> 44:43.700
Well, I think, I think that that's been the project of a lot of fascist types for a long

44:43.700 --> 44:44.700
time.

44:44.700 --> 44:45.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:45.700 --> 44:47.900
You know, neo-Nazis have revisionist ideas about what happened in Germany.

44:47.900 --> 44:55.460
Well, I mean, when you allow the Texas board to have any influence over textbooks whatsoever,

44:55.460 --> 44:57.340
you're not going to get a real history.

44:57.340 --> 45:00.700
Alex has revisionist ideas about the Confederacy.

45:00.700 --> 45:02.180
It's not, it's not too surprising.

45:02.180 --> 45:06.380
How many people learned that it was about states' rights in school?

45:06.380 --> 45:07.380
How many people?

45:07.380 --> 45:08.380
Probably Alex.

45:08.380 --> 45:14.560
Millions, millions, maybe the entire country in our elementary school system that is designed

45:14.560 --> 45:19.540
to teach you history and for you to take into the world, they lied straight to your face

45:19.540 --> 45:20.540
when you were seven.

45:20.540 --> 45:23.760
What are you going to do?

45:23.760 --> 45:30.020
So Harrison is, is going on here on inauguration day and he's talking about how the, the mainstream

45:30.020 --> 45:37.140
media, the MSM, the globalists, they've taken the people who believe that Trump won and

45:37.140 --> 45:43.060
they've turned the idea that Trump won into the big lie that they're being misrepresented.

45:43.060 --> 45:44.760
This is just nonsense.

45:44.760 --> 45:49.860
This they're calling the big lie and they're saying, even pointing this out or people trying

45:49.860 --> 45:54.260
to represent their constituents who are all calling out saying, this was fake, please,

45:54.260 --> 45:56.680
for the love of God, you're supposed to be our representative.

45:56.680 --> 45:59.560
Please say something, please stop this deal from going forward.

45:59.560 --> 46:04.700
They are now being portrayed as racist, fascist, implementing a new Jim Crow.

46:04.700 --> 46:07.820
I mean, this is absurd.

46:07.820 --> 46:12.960
This is beyond anything we've ever experienced before and at the heart of it.

46:12.960 --> 46:15.620
This is a war against white people.

46:15.620 --> 46:17.780
That's what you have to realize.

46:17.780 --> 46:20.100
They are making a concerted effort now.

46:20.100 --> 46:21.100
They're out in the open.

46:21.100 --> 46:22.100
They're not hiding it.

46:22.100 --> 46:25.540
They're not couching it in any friendly phrases.

46:25.540 --> 46:30.700
They're saying white people are bad, must be destroyed, must be rooted out, must be

46:30.700 --> 46:35.240
ripped out by the roots, must be eliminated from this country.

46:35.240 --> 46:36.860
So at this point I got a little bit worried.

46:36.860 --> 46:40.780
I was like, I'm listening to, I was just checking in on inauguration day.

46:40.780 --> 46:44.900
I got a little sniff of something that I thought maybe Harrison was a bigot.

46:44.900 --> 46:46.900
I went and watched his stop white genocide video.

46:46.900 --> 46:49.860
Now I come back to the inauguration, he's talking about the war on whites.

46:49.860 --> 46:50.860
The war on white people.

46:50.860 --> 46:51.860
Oh no.

46:51.860 --> 46:54.100
I was like, what did I get into?

46:54.100 --> 46:55.780
They've declared war on the whites.

46:55.780 --> 46:59.900
It wasn't that white nationalists literally tried to overthrow the country.

46:59.900 --> 47:01.860
They've declared war on all white people.

47:01.860 --> 47:08.460
I was like, okay, when I sat down to prepare this episode, I was thinking, all right, I'll

47:08.460 --> 47:12.740
breeze through Harrison's dumb ass and then we'll get to Alex and that'll be when the

47:12.740 --> 47:13.980
episode really begins.

47:13.980 --> 47:18.980
No, this is going to be half the episode probably talking about Harrison Smith.

47:18.980 --> 47:19.980
Brutal.

47:19.980 --> 47:20.980
Yeah.

47:20.980 --> 47:21.980
Brutal.

47:21.980 --> 47:22.980
Terrible.

47:22.980 --> 47:25.540
He is real biggity.

47:25.540 --> 47:31.540
Let's just stop for one second and remember that the evil globalists are now declaring

47:31.540 --> 47:32.820
war on white people.

47:32.820 --> 47:33.940
According to Harrison.

47:33.940 --> 47:39.620
Even though last year, only a few months ago, their plan B was murdering everyone.

47:39.620 --> 47:40.620
Sure.

47:40.620 --> 47:44.420
Well, plan B is not to be remembered now because it's not the profitable angle.

47:44.420 --> 47:45.420
Well, that's fair.

47:45.420 --> 47:46.420
Yeah.

47:46.420 --> 47:48.660
We have, uh, we've gotten a new sales flow chart.

47:48.660 --> 47:49.660
Now it's white.

47:49.660 --> 47:50.960
Whiteness only.

47:50.960 --> 47:51.960
Certainly for Harrison's show.

47:51.960 --> 47:52.960
Yeah.

47:52.960 --> 47:56.540
So he also wishes that Trump was a little bit more authoritarian and he's talking about

47:56.540 --> 48:03.420
this in the framework of sort of optics differences between Trump's inauguration and Biden's.

48:03.420 --> 48:06.260
Um, he's being really dumb here.

48:06.260 --> 48:10.340
When Donald Trump won duly elected, nobody expected it, but he did it.

48:10.340 --> 48:11.340
He pulled it out.

48:11.340 --> 48:13.460
He pulled, he pulled through.

48:13.460 --> 48:18.580
He got elected president of the United States and everybody was very, very concerned about

48:18.580 --> 48:19.580
authoritarianism.

48:19.580 --> 48:29.500
I'll tell you if in 2016, before the Trump inauguration, DC was filled with 65,000 troops

48:29.500 --> 48:37.940
and there were people going on TV who were heads of the army saying, we need to have

48:37.940 --> 48:43.260
purity tests and we need to kick out anybody that doesn't adhere to our view of what it

48:43.260 --> 48:48.540
is to be an American and reality entire national mall was covered in flags because they weren't

48:48.540 --> 48:51.040
letting any people come.

48:51.040 --> 48:55.460
And the entire city of Washington, DC was locked down like the green zone in Iraq.

48:55.460 --> 48:57.980
You tried to throw a little freaked out.

48:57.980 --> 49:02.400
I would have thought, Oh God, maybe this is the authoritarianism they're warning about.

49:02.400 --> 49:03.900
Of course that didn't happen.

49:03.900 --> 49:04.900
None of that happened.

49:04.900 --> 49:05.900
Nothing.

49:05.900 --> 49:07.100
Just authoritarian in the slightest.

49:07.100 --> 49:08.660
I wish it had been more so.

49:08.660 --> 49:14.200
I wish he had been more like the, the monster that they portrayed him as.

49:14.200 --> 49:19.620
Maybe we wouldn't be in the situation we're in now if he'd actually used an iron fist.

49:19.620 --> 49:20.840
Ah, what a shock.

49:20.840 --> 49:24.340
Someone who works at info wars revealing that they wish Trump was a dictator.

49:24.340 --> 49:29.540
If they think history is a lie, these motherfuckers can't remember two weeks ago clearly.

49:29.540 --> 49:30.540
No, I know.

49:30.540 --> 49:34.220
That was the thing that really bothered me about that, like, uh, that description of

49:34.220 --> 49:35.220
the inauguration.

49:35.220 --> 49:38.540
It was like, you're pretending there's no cause to these effects.

49:38.540 --> 49:48.560
Did, did I, Dan, now I could be wrong, but I don't remember in January of 2017, uh, liberals

49:48.560 --> 49:49.860
overthrowing the Capitol.

49:49.860 --> 49:51.120
No, that didn't happen.

49:51.120 --> 49:52.120
That didn't happen?

49:52.120 --> 49:54.220
And that kind of affects this inauguration.

49:54.220 --> 49:59.860
Also, the smaller crowds pandemic, the flags also about a memorial to those lost.

49:59.860 --> 50:00.860
Representative to the pandemic.

50:00.860 --> 50:05.260
They keep bringing up the flags as if it's just like a way to fill space because people

50:05.260 --> 50:06.260
couldn't be there.

50:06.260 --> 50:08.300
It's like, no, there was a symbolic meaning to that.

50:08.300 --> 50:13.580
Yeah, it wasn't that we committed, uh, oh, well, I mean, some could argue even a genocide

50:13.580 --> 50:15.580
with intent to kill the poor.

50:15.580 --> 50:18.260
If you go back and look at Kushner's fucking statements.

50:18.260 --> 50:23.680
And then, uh, in terms of like, uh, the screening of service members, that is also because some

50:23.680 --> 50:25.580
were involved in storming the Capitol.

50:25.580 --> 50:26.580
There was that.

50:26.580 --> 50:27.580
Um, yeah.

50:27.580 --> 50:32.880
So I mean, like, I think that when you have a situation like that, um, it's important

50:32.880 --> 50:39.420
not to allow yourself to give in to the impulse to go on a McCarthy-esque witch hunt.

50:39.420 --> 50:44.280
But at the same time, the conversation about extremism and extremists infiltrating law

50:44.280 --> 50:50.660
enforcement and, uh, uh, the, the services like that is something that is long overdue.

50:50.660 --> 50:55.120
Uh, but you have to retain your, your, uh, sensibility about it.

50:55.120 --> 50:58.260
You can't just be like, oh, this guy donates to the Heritage Foundation.

50:58.260 --> 50:59.260
Yeah.

50:59.260 --> 51:00.260
Therefore he's an extremist.

51:00.260 --> 51:01.260
No.

51:01.260 --> 51:02.260
You can't go that far.

51:02.260 --> 51:03.260
No.

51:03.260 --> 51:04.260
You need to be careful.

51:04.260 --> 51:07.660
But that's a conversation that you should never pretend you can have with someone like

51:07.660 --> 51:08.660
Harrison Smith.

51:08.660 --> 51:15.380
Yeah, no, it wasn't like in 1863 Lincoln was like, well, of course I need to have a confederate

51:15.380 --> 51:17.460
in my secret service detail.

51:17.460 --> 51:20.760
Why wouldn't I have a confederate soldier in my secret service team?

51:20.760 --> 51:26.360
It would be discrimination for me to get rid of this literal enemy of the United States

51:26.360 --> 51:28.200
from my secret service detail.

51:28.200 --> 51:32.320
And then I would also like to say, um, just in the same way that like the screening of

51:32.320 --> 51:34.600
things is like a very sensible, reasonable thing.

51:34.600 --> 51:39.840
You can understand why it would happen, but you have to resist going too far with it.

51:39.840 --> 51:40.840
Of course.

51:40.840 --> 51:46.960
I would say that the, like the presence of security forces in, uh, and around the inauguration

51:46.960 --> 51:48.600
is something that I don't like to see.

51:48.600 --> 51:49.600
It's not good.

51:49.600 --> 51:50.600
No, it's fucked up.

51:50.600 --> 51:51.600
Yeah.

51:51.600 --> 51:52.600
I can be against that.

51:52.600 --> 51:55.880
And at the same time, be enough of an adult to understand why it's happening.

51:55.880 --> 51:56.880
Yeah.

51:56.880 --> 51:57.880
Yeah.

51:57.880 --> 52:00.360
I don't have to, I can, I can be against the militarization of the police and still

52:00.360 --> 52:04.200
recognize, hey, some people fucking stormed the Capitol a week, two weeks ago.

52:04.200 --> 52:08.480
And I understand that you're like, oh no, there were so many troops there.

52:08.480 --> 52:09.480
I understand that.

52:09.480 --> 52:13.240
But you need to understand there were so many there because they're worried.

52:13.240 --> 52:17.400
There are a lot of you wanting to overthrow the United States government.

52:17.400 --> 52:24.200
And there were people online, uh, impotently or sincerely discussing plans for other, uh,

52:24.200 --> 52:25.200
things.

52:25.200 --> 52:30.680
You know, and I do think that probably if it was less or if it was more than two weeks

52:30.680 --> 52:35.120
in between, there might've been a better solution that would have been available.

52:35.120 --> 52:38.680
But it's a really, it's a really time crunch kind of situation.

52:38.680 --> 52:42.160
Well, you know, America, we never overreact to situations.

52:42.160 --> 52:43.160
Sure.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.160
Yeah.

52:44.160 --> 52:48.320
And again, like what I'm saying is those things are valid concerns to have.

52:48.320 --> 52:49.320
Yeah, absolutely.

52:49.320 --> 52:53.120
Just not something that you should ever find common cause or ally ship with info warriors

52:53.120 --> 52:54.760
about because they're not sincere.

52:54.760 --> 52:57.240
And it's your fault that those things happened.

52:57.240 --> 52:58.240
Well, anyway.

52:58.240 --> 53:02.240
You are the one who literally said the Capitol has fallen to the Patriots.

53:02.240 --> 53:06.520
He did, but he pretends that he didn't because he's against it now.

53:06.520 --> 53:07.520
Sure.

53:07.520 --> 53:08.520
Fuck off.

53:08.520 --> 53:09.920
No, you don't get to do this.

53:09.920 --> 53:10.920
He shouldn't.

53:10.920 --> 53:15.400
So, um, you may recall that Alex has said that, uh, if the host of the American journal

53:15.400 --> 53:18.360
doesn't take calls, they will not be hosting it any longer.

53:18.360 --> 53:19.360
That is true.

53:19.360 --> 53:23.760
Harrison doesn't take calls immediately, but he does get to some calls and these calls

53:23.760 --> 53:24.760
are not good.

53:24.760 --> 53:25.760
Filled with happy people.

53:25.760 --> 53:26.760
Oh boy.

53:26.760 --> 53:27.760
Greetings Harrison.

53:27.760 --> 53:30.400
This is the Renegade Patriot in Ohio.

53:30.400 --> 53:35.820
I use this calling in because, uh, I've been listening for 11 years in silence, but I prompted

53:35.820 --> 53:41.640
me to make my own YouTube channel that was inspired partly by info wars and by a political

53:41.640 --> 53:46.960
prisoner named Charles Dyer, Sergeant Charles Dyer, known as July four Patriot on YouTube.

53:46.960 --> 53:51.700
In case you're curious, Charles Dyer is not a political prisoner in 2012, he was convicted

53:51.700 --> 53:56.040
of sexually abusing his six year old daughter and sentenced to 30 years in jail.

53:56.040 --> 53:59.600
He's been turned into the hero of the extreme right wing who curiously call everyone they

53:59.600 --> 54:04.160
don't like pedophiles because he was a member of the oath keepers and was the type of extreme

54:04.160 --> 54:08.720
right wing militia guy that when his house was searched, they found a fucking grenade

54:08.720 --> 54:09.720
launcher.

54:09.720 --> 54:13.080
Anyway, it says a whole lot about a fellow when they call into Harrison's show and say

54:13.080 --> 54:16.640
they were inspired to start a YouTube channel because of info wars and Charles Dyer.

54:16.640 --> 54:20.160
Yeah, that one, that one solves most problems.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.560
Now that caller was bad.

54:21.560 --> 54:22.560
Yeah.

54:22.560 --> 54:23.560
Not great.

54:23.560 --> 54:24.560
Yeah.

54:24.560 --> 54:25.960
Nothing compared to this next caller.

54:25.960 --> 54:27.160
Oh, that's not good.

54:27.160 --> 54:28.620
This caller is...

54:28.620 --> 54:29.620
It can't escalate.

54:29.620 --> 54:30.620
Oh boy.

54:30.620 --> 54:40.560
After analyzing the top 10 high rank picks for Biden, all 10 of them have a dual citizenship

54:40.560 --> 54:42.680
in the state of Israel.

54:42.680 --> 54:48.520
So you know, Trump tried his best to get that support from the Israeli lobby and really

54:48.520 --> 54:50.680
he was basically the best president for Israel ever.

54:50.680 --> 54:54.440
I mean, that's actually true, yet it didn't even work.

54:54.440 --> 54:57.960
They don't support him now and they're all, Biden's their man.

54:57.960 --> 55:01.360
So we've been over this before, but when you hear a right wing dumb dumb like this caller

55:01.360 --> 55:06.300
bring up someone having dual citizenship with Israel, it's an expression of deep antisemitism.

55:06.300 --> 55:09.700
It goes hand in hand with the Holocaust didn't happen.

55:09.700 --> 55:13.280
This guy wants to complain that Biden has Jewish people in his cabinet, but he knows

55:13.280 --> 55:14.360
that that looks bad.

55:14.360 --> 55:19.080
So he tries to couch things, tries to couch that hatred of Jews and language that has

55:19.080 --> 55:22.120
to do with concerns about dual citizenship.

55:22.120 --> 55:27.000
This is a classic neo-Nazi talking point that the Jewish criminals who they believe run

55:27.000 --> 55:30.880
the world, they don't care that what they're doing is illegal because their Jewish heritage

55:30.880 --> 55:33.520
gives them right of return citizenship in Israel.

55:33.520 --> 55:35.840
So they can just flee there and avoid being held accountable.

55:35.840 --> 55:38.360
Uh, Dan, I saw Die Hard 2.

55:38.360 --> 55:40.580
Diplomatic immunity.

55:40.580 --> 55:44.420
This is what's at the core of this caller and what he's expressing here.

55:44.420 --> 55:47.520
And it's been an insidious antisemitic trope for decades.

55:47.520 --> 55:48.600
Since Die Hard 2.

55:48.600 --> 55:52.820
This caller, incidentally, is just responding to a meme that went around on Twitter from

55:52.820 --> 55:57.960
an account called Syndrome of a Down, which claimed, quote, all 10 of Biden's high profile

55:57.960 --> 55:59.640
appointees are Jews.

55:59.640 --> 56:02.520
That's right, every single one.

56:02.520 --> 56:06.560
This is accompanied by a screenshot depicting 10 Biden appointees next to Israeli flags,

56:06.560 --> 56:08.160
which is unsettling.

56:08.160 --> 56:11.720
This is a really simple game this Nazi is playing where they just cherry pick Jewish

56:11.720 --> 56:15.880
people Biden has appointed to various offices, then assert baselessly that these 10 are the

56:15.880 --> 56:20.320
most high profile appointees, whatever that means, and that it's suspicious that these

56:20.320 --> 56:21.320
people are Jewish.

56:21.320 --> 56:22.320
Of course.

56:22.320 --> 56:23.320
This is transparent.

56:23.320 --> 56:26.560
And anyone who's calling in to enforce to repeat this talking point is absolutely an

56:26.560 --> 56:28.560
antisemite until proven otherwise.

56:28.560 --> 56:29.560
Totally.

56:29.560 --> 56:33.560
Quite a show Harrison is hosting here, just full of white identity based fear, callers

56:33.560 --> 56:36.560
inspired by patriot pedophiles and potential neo-Nazis.

56:36.560 --> 56:37.560
Yep.

56:37.560 --> 56:41.400
Now, Harrison tries to fact check this guy.

56:41.400 --> 56:42.400
Oh yeah?

56:42.400 --> 56:43.400
And he finds the meme.

56:43.400 --> 56:44.400
Oh my God.

56:44.400 --> 56:45.400
And so he just reads the meme.

56:45.400 --> 56:46.920
Is Joe Rogan fact checking here?

56:46.920 --> 56:47.920
Yeah.

56:47.920 --> 56:48.920
Hell, you're making a lot of good points.

56:48.920 --> 56:53.840
You have, uh, the, the image here that's been going around all 10 of Biden's high profile

56:53.840 --> 56:56.720
appointees are Jews and dual citizens with Israel.

56:56.720 --> 57:01.000
You have secretary of the treasury, Janet Yellen, attorney general, Merrick Garland,

57:01.000 --> 57:02.960
secretary of home real quick there.

57:02.960 --> 57:07.040
The meme that he's reading off of doesn't say and dual citizens of Israel.

57:07.040 --> 57:08.400
It just says Jews.

57:08.400 --> 57:09.400
Yeah.

57:09.400 --> 57:12.120
Harrison has added that because he realizes don't want to do it.

57:12.120 --> 57:13.120
Oh boy.

57:13.120 --> 57:14.120
I'm going to hit that J too hard.

57:14.120 --> 57:16.160
I have to soften this a little bit.

57:16.160 --> 57:19.520
Otherwise, otherwise it looks as antisemitic as it is.

57:19.520 --> 57:20.520
Yeah.

57:20.520 --> 57:25.880
Homeland security, Alejandro Mayorkas, uh, director of national intelligence, Avril Haines,

57:25.880 --> 57:31.080
uh, white house chief of staff, Ron Klain, secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, deputy

57:31.080 --> 57:37.360
secretary of state, Wendy Sherman, secretary of state for political affairs, Victoria Newland,

57:37.360 --> 57:41.880
the office of science and technology policy, Eric Lander, director of the central intelligence

57:41.880 --> 57:44.040
agency, David S. Cohen.

57:44.040 --> 57:46.020
Now call me crazy.

57:46.020 --> 57:50.340
I think the people serving in our government serving in the American government should

57:50.340 --> 57:53.240
not be dual citizens with another country.

57:53.240 --> 57:55.760
Am I crazy for thinking, am I an anti-Semite?

57:55.760 --> 57:56.760
Yes.

57:56.760 --> 57:58.400
You are super antisemitic.

57:58.400 --> 57:59.760
That is exactly what you are.

57:59.760 --> 58:04.400
That's really, really bad when you traffic in dual loyalty tropes about Jewish Americans.

58:04.400 --> 58:08.560
It's super basic stuff in terms of antisemitism and I can explain one of the reasons why it's

58:08.560 --> 58:10.540
really obvious.

58:10.540 --> 58:13.880
Harrison's complaint is that these people are dual citizens in the United States and

58:13.880 --> 58:15.040
Israel.

58:15.040 --> 58:21.480
Having dual citizenship in this case is defined, defined solely as these people being Jewish.

58:21.480 --> 58:25.160
Insisting the people who have dual citizenship being in government is suspicious or wrong

58:25.160 --> 58:28.720
is really just a way for these people to say that they think Jewish people shouldn't be

58:28.720 --> 58:33.320
in government without having to say something so obviously antisemitic.

58:33.320 --> 58:34.680
Harrison isn't an idiot.

58:34.680 --> 58:37.080
He understands this dynamic fully well.

58:37.080 --> 58:41.000
He's a flagrant bigot who knows that daddy Alex will fire him if he speaks too freely,

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
I suspect.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.720
And so you do stuff like this.

58:43.720 --> 58:45.600
This is outrageous.

58:45.600 --> 58:51.620
This can't be like, I was aghast at this.

58:51.620 --> 58:54.560
This is not what I expected on inauguration day.

58:54.560 --> 58:56.360
Out and out white supremacy?

58:56.360 --> 58:57.360
And yeah, yeah.

58:57.360 --> 59:01.520
Honestly I kind of was expecting this on inauguration day because you can't say that they're going

59:01.520 --> 59:02.520
to kill everybody now.

59:02.520 --> 59:05.840
I expected it before.

59:05.840 --> 59:08.000
Well we've seen plenty of it before.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.840
But this is- Not quite.

59:09.840 --> 59:10.840
Not quite.

59:10.840 --> 59:12.400
No Jews should be in the government.

59:12.400 --> 59:16.160
And maybe it's a function of Harrison Smith being like not a great broadcaster.

59:16.160 --> 59:18.840
That he's being this- Yeah, yeah.

59:18.840 --> 59:19.840
This transparent about it.

59:19.840 --> 59:22.320
He doesn't have the chops to be less racist.

59:22.320 --> 59:25.360
Man, and this caller keeps going.

59:25.360 --> 59:26.360
Oh.

59:26.360 --> 59:27.360
Why?

59:27.360 --> 59:32.000
Well remember there was this nice sweet little Jewish lady who came onto Oprah and said that

59:32.000 --> 59:34.880
within the Jewish community there are people who are not Jewish.

59:34.880 --> 59:38.140
They're hiding under Judaism but they're not Jews.

59:38.140 --> 59:41.520
They don't follow Moses, they don't follow the Torah, they don't follow the Ten Commandments

59:41.520 --> 59:44.960
so if you're a Jew and you actually follow the Ten Commandments, you know, you're not

59:44.960 --> 59:45.960
the problem.

59:45.960 --> 59:46.960
We're not talking about you.

59:46.960 --> 59:52.520
But there are people who hide behind this Judaism and she openly admitted they are breeding

59:52.520 --> 59:56.560
babies with really obese people who you can't even tell they're pregnant.

59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.440
And then they do satanic rituals and when Oprah asked her, why are you doing this?

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.200
She goes, for power.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.360
Like it was an obvious thing, like you should know.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.880
So I don't think these people are actually Jews.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:12.560
I think they're part of an organization that is satanic that is hiding behind Judaism.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.880
Wow.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:18.380
I was listening to this caller go hard on the antisemitism and listening to Harrison

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:22.920
be completely open to it and not shut it down at all and I was thinking, I wonder how long

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.040
it's going to be until we get into blood libel.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.040
Yeah.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.040
Turns out not too long.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.040
Not long at all.

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:33.720
This Oprah segment that the caller is bringing up is from May 1989 and it was a huge embarrassment

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.920
for Oprah.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.560
What happened is that there was that whole satanic panic going on in America.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:43.160
The McMartin preschool trial was in its like sixth year and lurid stories of ritualistic

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:47.960
satanic abuse were widespread, the idea that they were widespread in every neighborhood,

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.120
that was drawing ratings.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.720
Oprah tried to do an episode of her talk show about ritualistic satanic abuse cases and

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:57.880
one of her guests was a Jewish woman who told all sorts of insane stories about her family

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:02.680
performing ritual murders since the 1700s, that it was prevalent in Jewish families and

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.000
the police knew about it and didn't do anything.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Huh.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Oprah had attempted to frame the conversation by introducing the guest as someone who is

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000
quote mentally disturbed and under psychiatric care, but I think that's not good enough.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.400
A better move would not be doing this kind of interview with someone you have to preemptively

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.060
introduce as an unreliable source of information.

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:26.200
Just so everyone knows, I want you to say that this person is not fit to be on TV.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.200
Good.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.560
And now we're going to exploit her!

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.560
Exactly!

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.880
In the past it's putting a mentally unstable person in a position where they're being exploited

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.980
for ratings and at worst it was allowing a mentally unstable person to spread deeply

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:39.840
dangerous accusations about a religious community.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.640
Either way, if this had happened nowadays, Oprah's career would have been over.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.760
No, we would have fucked everybody up.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.760
Somehow in 1989.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.760
Ellen was just a dick!

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:53.060
In 1989, you can have this kind of a scandal and granted, you know, I was able to find

01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:58.300
a bunch of articles about Oprah meeting with leaders in the Jewish community and apologizing

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:02.680
and responding to criticism, but like, this should never have happened to begin with.

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:03.680
No, no, no, no, no.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.000
So producers better have been fired.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.480
Yeah, it's a good thing that 30 years later we're still hearing about it.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.480
That's how good it was.

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:14.560
Well, from Nazi callers on Harrison's Nazi show.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.840
Yeah, there's that.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.480
This show is absolutely mind-blowing and how offensive it is, this American Journal.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:26.200
Harrison Smith seems way, way more committed to or just willing to broadcast explicit racism

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.840
and anti-semitism to the audience.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.840
Yeah.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:34.880
I was taken aback by how horrible this is.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:40.000
I would say, I think, I mean, maybe there's just a simple explanation, which is that Harrison

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.680
isn't rich enough to want to protect money more than anybody who's not white.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:49.040
I can't imagine that he has a more lucrative offer than what he's doing at Infowars.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.040
Absolutely.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:53.840
And I can't imagine Alex pays him anywhere near what David Knight got.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:54.840
That's true.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:03:00.280
And I also, I would imagine that if Alex wanted him to curb these behaviors, he would.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.280
Maybe.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.480
And then he would get an alias and write a blog.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.520
Well, that's probably true.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:09.120
Start a YouTube channel where he wears a mask and bores everyone with racism.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.280
That would be linked back to Infowars.com too, yeah.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.280
Undoubtedly.

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.280
Yeah.

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:20.800
So Harrison takes another call and apparently what needs to happen is, you know how Infowars

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:26.400
is obsessed with the idea that there are no-go zones all over Europe, where the Muslims won't

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.400
let people in?

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.400
Absolutely.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.320
Well, Harrison believes that they need to make some no-go zones in America, basically.

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.320
Okay.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.400
Well, we're going to move into a very new dynamic.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:40.080
And I've said it before, I think geographic approximation will suddenly become very important.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:43.780
I think you need to find like-minded people that you can be near, that you can protect

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:49.760
each other, that you can actually put up a substantial force in order to prevent the

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:56.440
American forces from coming in and robbing you of the rights that you have as a sovereign

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.440
individual.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.280
I think, you know, personally, maybe I'm a little biased because I'm from Texas, but

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:04.760
I can't think of a better place to gather patriots and say, everybody who's out there

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.520
in America, I know it would suck to have to leave your home and go to a different place,

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.560
but if we stay de-separated, if we stay sort of in these small pockets around and around,

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.640
they'll come one by one and scoop us all up.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.300
You have to, we have to gather in a single place.

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:20.560
We have to defend that place.

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:27.400
We have to create areas of land that the powers that be cannot break into, cannot get into.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:31.200
We need to have our own autonomous zones around the country.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.600
Okay.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:36.740
All I heard was, I thought sundown towns were a great idea and I don't understand why we

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:37.760
ever stopped that.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.360
Was there something wrong with sundown towns, Dan?

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:41.360
It's strange.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.360
Yeah.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:46.760
This show gets really weird and I lost my taste for it at a certain point.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:47.760
I have very much.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:53.440
I had a lot of conversation about getting people to move to Texas to secede.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:05:00.640
He has a South African caller lady who seems to think that apartheid didn't happen, but

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:03.480
I couldn't make sense of what she was saying and so I don't have any clips of it.

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:06.040
It was just, it was kind of all over the place.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:12.760
And so here is how he goes out to break before Alex joins him for a little guest appearance

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.720
on the American Journal.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:17.240
This is bleak.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:20.160
Interesting agencies to review their actions and ensure racial equity.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.720
Everything's going to be based off this.

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.960
He's talking about like some of Biden's policy initiatives.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.040
Yeah, I'm seeing it.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:29.280
Racial equity, which basically means robbing white people and rewarding non-white people

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.760
in order to basically do a genocide on white people.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.360
I mean, it's not, let's not mince words here.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:39.520
Everything that the Chinese are doing to the Uyghur Muslims are exactly what the plans

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.000
are for the Biden administration for white people.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.520
I mean, when you say it's a good thing and we're making policy in order to decrease the

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:52.160
share of the population that white people hold, that is a genocidal policy.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.640
Let's again, let's not mince words, let's not pretend like this is something that it

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.640
isn't.

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:02.240
This is a genocidal policy to essentially eradicate anybody from standing up against

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.240
these people.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:09.400
And it all has to do with the fact that white people historically have been the only civilization

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:15.120
as far as the world is concerned that actually puts in freedom into their governmental organizations.

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:19.640
And that is mostly based on the fact that Christianity is a European religion.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.420
So third hour begins on the other side.

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:25.800
So now we've shifted into white supremacy from white nationalism.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.280
We're straight up there.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.280
No arguing that.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.280
You know, I will say this.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.920
This show is nuts.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.360
I will say this.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:35.560
I think Harrison has absolutely succeeded.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.160
When he said earlier, he is going to lay out the case for white genocide.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.160
I get what you're saying.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.160
He nailed it.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.160
Calm down.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.160
He nailed it.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.160
Calm down.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.160
Oh, he nailed it.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.160
Your satire.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.160
Your joke.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.160
Yeah.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:56.120
So Alex comes on to stop by the Journal and I was weirded out by this, actually.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:00.000
You're watching American Journal on Infowars.com, I'm Harrison Smith joined by Alex Jones.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Welcome, Alex.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.960
Yeah, and I'm just popping in for a segment here to invite all your wonderful viewers

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:10.080
to have our live coverage coming up here in just about 39 minutes of the installation

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.840
of the inauguration of the communist Chinese spy, Biden.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:17.320
Why is Alex coming to promote his show on Harrison's show?

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:21.040
Because the white nationalists are tuning in, Dan.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:27.000
Do get the sense that maybe Alex sees a different audience.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.760
Maybe Harrison is appealing to another audience that might not stick around to watch Alex.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:32.760
Yes.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:36.600
He's coming in to promote himself to them, because otherwise the only place you're watching

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:42.580
the American fucking Journal is on Infowars' streams, which would automatically start playing

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.220
Alex's show afterwards.

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:48.500
I would like to welcome all the Red Ice listeners to Harrison Smith's show, and I just want

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:51.240
to let you know that the Alex Jones show is up next.

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.240
Yeah.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:56.600
So Alex thinks that people think he's soft, because he accepts that Trump is going to

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:57.600
be leaving office.

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.600
Sure.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:03.000
I've seen him on Infowars.com saying, how dare you say he would leave today.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
You're a traitor.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.160
You're agreeing with CNN as if as I magically said he was going to stay.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.680
He was going to stay.

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.520
We literally talked to the president.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.520
Okay.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.520
I talked to two of his lawyers.

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:18.520
I talked to somebody else very close to him the last few days, and he was going.

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:23.320
As soon as he capitulated the day after January 6th, it was over.

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:24.320
What happened January 6th?

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.520
They sent in provocateurs.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:32.720
They sabotaged our operation, but that was a last-ditch Hail Mary to begin with.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.140
I was listening to that, and I was like, it's 10 a.m.

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.140
You sound fucked up.

01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:37.640
He sounds not good.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.640
Yeah.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:39.640
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.760
But I also was like, he probably just woke up or something.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:44.880
You know, I wasn't sure, but I was worried.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.880
I was worried.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:49.280
The way he's talking is not normal Alex Jones.

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:51.600
I would give him a hangover and a hair of the dog.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:53.440
I think that's what I'm hearing.

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:56.440
That's kind of what I thought, but then he explains what's going on.

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:57.440
OK.

01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.600
And so they don't want a big mainline debate about this.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.520
They want to have it be esoteric.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.320
They created a secret society to make people think that we're in the inside group with

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:11.840
military intelligence and that everything was going to be fine, so people can be pacified.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.800
I'm going to move on from Q at that point.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:19.280
We'll talk about what Biden's going to do, how they're going to strangle this country

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.720
during inauguration and afterwards.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.920
I do not have COVID or anything.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:29.680
I had some dental work done and got a little infection back on one of my tonsils have been

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:30.680
to see the doctor.

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:31.680
It's localized.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:32.680
It's fine.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:35.600
About a dime size rattle back in my throat, but I'm fine.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.600
I never take painkillers.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.000
I'm actually on painkillers right now.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Oh, OK.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
So you're on painkillers.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
All right.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Cool.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Good time to be at work.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
All right.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I'm just going to go.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
I'm just going to get some dental surgery.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.160
I talk for a living, dental surgery, the morning of Biden's inauguration and coming to work

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.160
high on painkillers.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.160
That's what I got to do.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.880
That's what you got to do, Dan.

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:56.880
Wow.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:57.880
Inauguration.

01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:58.880
The show must go on.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:02.720
I will say that I don't think it affects him nearly as much as it could have.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:03.720
Yeah.

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:04.960
So it's not like he's fucked up.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.040
You could just hear like there's a there's something different in his delivery and that

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.040
explains it.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.040
He had some dental work done.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.040
He's on some painkillers.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.040
Yeah.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:21.400
So I think that they thought that Biden would be giving his getting sworn in on Alex's show.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:22.400
Right.

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.400
But that doesn't work out.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.400
No.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:30.280
And you know, we get all of that while Harrison is still hosting and Alex has left to prepare

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.280
for his show.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.280
Yeah.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.280
And so Harrison tries.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:34.280
God bless him.

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.280
He tries.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:38.520
Joe Biden probably wondering where the hell he is right now.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:45.200
Hey, there's a baby that knows what's going on.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.800
Hell yeah.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.360
That's great work, Harrison.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.640
That's great work.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:56.480
So Harrison just plays Biden's acceptance speech and he interrupts kind of limitedly

01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:00.840
because I think that he's just hoping that Biden will make a big flub and then respond

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:01.840
to.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:02.840
Yeah.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.880
The whole narrative about Biden on Infowars is that he's senile and he can't form sentences.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.680
So honestly, I think this is a bad strategy.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:12.360
They're literally airing evidence that he can speak and make sentences, essentially

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.880
debunking one of their big talking points.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.720
And that is how the journal wraps up.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:18.720
Yeah.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.720
The book.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.760
I assume he's a big enough man to apologize for saying that Joe Biden is not.

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.760
Nope.

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:25.760
He's not?

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:26.760
They just sort of pretend that they never said that.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:29.960
Much like Harrison pretending that he didn't say the capital's fallen to the Patriots.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:30.960
Weird.

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:31.960
Yeah.

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:37.080
So Alex comes in and he knows what to do a little bit better than Harrison.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:40.400
Harrison just lets Biden talk for long stretches.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.400
Sure.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.320
Alex tries to mystery science theater that shit.

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:44.320
Hell yeah.

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:52.600
A few centuries ago, St. Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:59.320
defined by the common objects of their love, defined by the common objects of their love.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.560
What are the common objects we as Americans love?

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.560
Children, you want to molest.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.600
Define us as Americans.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:12.800
I think we know opportunity, world government, security, liberty, the population, dignity,

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.680
and honor.

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:17.040
And yes, the truth.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.720
So yeah, that's, that's what you come to expect for watching a speech on Infowars.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.720
Yeah.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:26.300
You know, for somebody who thinks that Biden is senile, he got his speech patterns pretty

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.600
well down.

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:32.520
Uh, Alex knows when to jump in real quick about how much time he has.

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:34.080
It seems like he, yeah.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:39.680
So Biden, in his speech, he proposes that his first act will be a moment of silence

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.440
for the Americans lost to COVID.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:43.680
How does Alex take that?

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.440
Well, it's interesting because we know that from listening to his show, he often has long

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:49.960
stretches of dead air.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:50.960
Yeah.

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.400
So a moment of silence should be no big deal.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.400
Takes nothing.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.400
Should be no big deal.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.400
It's a moment.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:02.280
In my first act as president, I'd like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:09.560
Remember all those who we lost in this past year to the pandemic, those 400,000.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:13.880
Most of which died of something else, husband's wife, son's daughters that came out of the

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:19.200
Wuhan lab that your buddies, Obama and Fauci and Gates cooked up for becoming the people

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.200
and the Democrat States.

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:24.400
When you ship COVID patients into the nursing homes and kill people, I ask you, let's have

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:34.000
a moment of silence for by the Democrats in the UN and the shy comms murdered.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
And my most silencer.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:41.560
We can't do that on our radio stations have silence once and it'll send everybody into

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.560
a panic.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:43.560
Having a moment of silence.

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:49.360
Alex pretends that he can't accept this moment of silence because of radio restrictions.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.160
That's such nonsense.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:55.800
He just has to interrupt the moment of silence to like not allow it to air.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:00.560
I would bet that he has like some spiritual explanation for it in his head.

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:05.840
Like he, I can't allow, I can't allow Biden to have a spiritual moment on info war.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:06.840
Absolutely not.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.840
Yeah.

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:08.840
That's really weird.

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:10.700
He has to, he can't, he can't let it happen.

01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:16.240
So this next clip is maybe the only, uh, real moment where, uh, on Alex's show itself where

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.320
I was like, Oh, those pills might be affecting you.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.000
Pass along a new and better world to our children.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.320
I believe we must, I'm sure you do as well.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.600
I believe we will.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:33.960
And when we do, we'll write the next great chapter in the history of the United States

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:34.960
of America.

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:35.960
A story.

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:42.440
It might sound something like a song that means a lot to me.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:45.040
It's called American anthem.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:53.400
And there there's one verse that stands out, at least for me, like this work and prayers

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:57.280
of century have brought us to this day.

01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.440
What shall be our legacy?

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.040
What will our children say?

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:10.360
Let me know in my heart, when my days are through America, America, I gave my best to

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.160
you.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.480
Let's add, let's us add our own work and prayers.

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:18.760
So this is the front man, all they dismantle the country.

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:22.640
All they teach America shouldn't exist while they pull down our statues.

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.500
Then when our days are through while they burn down cities and our children's children

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:27.500
will save us.

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:32.800
He says that he loves America and he's here to bring us unity.

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.240
They healed all their pundits say they want to put us in reeducation camps.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.240
Yikes.

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:40.420
Um, the part where at the beginning where it just seemed like he wasn't making a lot

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:45.400
of sense, the interjections he was making were like, he lost the, he lost the thread.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:51.980
But he picked it up together to like at least make sense, I guess by the end, although still

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:52.980
messed up.

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:53.980
Yeah.

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:58.400
So Alex had been talking about how they were going to be commercial free because there's

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:01.760
a lot to cover at the inauguration.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:06.400
Fourteen minutes into his show, this is what happens.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.400
But now that's my next question.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.680
I thought this would go for hours.

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:09.680
Well, it isn't.

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:13.160
So we are not going to be commercial free, I guess until six o'clock tonight when we

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:17.400
take calls up until 10 PM and have a whole raft of special guests here.

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.800
So Alex had expected this inauguration to go all day.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:22.200
He didn't realize it was going to be a ceremony.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.600
It's real quick.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:24.600
Yeah.

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:29.920
He didn't realize that maybe Trump's rambling speeches aren't normal.

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:34.200
The wedding ceremony part of the wedding is usually pretty quick.

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.200
Yeah.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.200
The reception is what goes on.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.200
It's the reception that takes a while.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:38.200
Yeah.

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.200
A party.

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.280
Unless you have maybe someone who's officiating the wedding because of Blowhard.

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.280
Sure.

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.280
That can happen.

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.280
Yes.

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.280
Bet you might be there a while.

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.280
Could be.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:51.560
And I think Alex expected a Blowhard as a president because of last time.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:54.000
And 14 minutes in he realizes, uh-oh.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Oh no.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Oh no.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.560
Oh this isn't going to be a rambling nonsense speech that I can...

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.560
I have got.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.960
I have no commercial breaks.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:03.960
Not good.

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.360
Let's get those commercial breaks back.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.280
Guys, I don't have anything to say.

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.640
I am not doing this commercial free.

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:10.640
Yeah.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:15.080
When he gave me 14 minutes of content that even listening to it I had a hard time riffing

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.080
over.

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.080
Yeah.

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:18.080
Jesus.

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.080
Not good.

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:20.080
So here's a commercial that Alex goes to.

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.080
Sure.

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:26.400
And I listen to his commercials on Infowars itself for a while because I generally listen

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:31.840
through the feeds that have Genesis Communications commercials on them.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.880
So here's one of Alex's commercials.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:34.880
This blew my mind.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:40.000
The pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.840
redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.640
Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:49.840
a chip under your skin.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:55.880
It's all now completely official, part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and

01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:00.600
Klaus Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.880
Foundation, all the rest of them, agenda 21, agenda 2030.

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:04.880
It's here.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:09.440
And only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:10.440
it all.

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:16.600
And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, good versus evil, and stopping

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.600
abortion.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:18.600
What?

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.600
What's going on here?

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.600
What is happening?

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:22.600
This is a commercial?

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.000
Am I supposed to watch this show or?

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:30.360
The musical cues are sophomoric, they're amateurish.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:31.360
Love it.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:34.320
Yeah, I don't know what's going on here.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.240
Also, I don't know what he's talking about.

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:43.560
I think this is old because the pope, in his Easter letter last year, discussed UBI.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:47.320
And maybe the world is approaching a point where universal basic income is something

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.720
we should be considering.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:53.040
I couldn't find, I don't know if he's doubled down on that, but that was like a big story

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.040
in April.

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.040
Sure.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.040
Yeah.

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.040
I don't know.

01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:02.000
I just thought that like, I thought the music, it's all like really dark and like music and

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.200
then at the end like.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.800
Is that a commercial so much or just an interstitial?

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.940
Do you think there's a product that he's selling?

01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:11.600
That's what I'm confused about.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:15.520
Am I just supposed to listen to more Info Wars because UBI might be coming?

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:16.520
I don't know.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.520
I can't actually remember.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.440
I was so caught off guard by that left turn to like, you have to stop abortion.

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:23.560
Yeah, that one threw me.

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:24.560
I was like.

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.360
I forgot the previous part of the commercial.

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:32.320
It might have ended up in like a bodies commercial or something, but I don't know.

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:38.160
Anyway, we get back to Alex's coverage of the inauguration, which is now over 15 minutes

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:39.160
into a show.

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:40.160
Yeah.

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.160
Yeah.

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:42.160
Trouble.

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.160
And so he's got to do what he does.

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.360
I assume he didn't listen to the poets.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.360
No.

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:46.360
No.

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:47.840
He didn't do anything else except for.

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:48.840
Yeah.

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:55.680
I mean, maybe in the evening coverage, they went over the party aspect, but oh, no, they

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:57.920
also they complained about Lady Gaga a little bit.

01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:58.920
Who cares?

01:19:58.920 --> 01:19:59.920
Yeah.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:00.920
Why not?

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:06.840
Anyway, Alex has a guest on who we've been curious about his whereabouts the FBI might

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:07.840
be as well.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.840
Okay, story.

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:09.840
I know you're on the road.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.480
I appreciate you popping on on short notice.

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:14.760
Obviously, I want to get your take on what's happened.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:18.080
How people that were delusional about Trump being invincible, how they're going to handle

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.080
it.

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:22.440
But the big issue, they're clearly saying domestic terrorism is here.

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.360
They're clearly preparing to wind up for rock and tour groups.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.360
You're a domestic terrorist.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:27.680
You are for the American people.

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:32.160
Stuart Rhodes, founder of the Oath Keepers.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.160
They're saying.

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:34.520
Been wondering what he's up to.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:35.520
Yeah.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.520
What's his lie going to be?

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.520
Ha ha.

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.520
Interesting.

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.560
Alex doesn't start with, Hey, I haven't seen you since the six.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:41.560
How was the six?

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.560
Yeah.

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:43.560
Do you have a good time?

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:44.560
What happened?

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:45.560
What happened?

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:46.560
Hey, Stuart Rhodes.

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.560
You're on the road.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.760
I am definitely not saying you're on the run.

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:50.760
Yeah, definitely.

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:51.760
Wouldn't say that.

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:52.760
I'm not.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:55.880
I'm not saying that he's wanted or anything, but he's a fucked up dude.

01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:01.640
Anyway, he is disappointed in Trump in very similar ways that Harrison was.

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.840
Everybody sees right through it.

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:05.200
These are not the president and vice president.

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:08.800
These are Chai Comm agents, Stuart Rhodes of OathKeepers.org.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:09.800
Your view on all this.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:14.600
Well, I think what we have to realize is that, you know, Trump actually failed.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:20.080
He, um, this is unpopular, but I consider it a dereliction of duty and frankly, cowards

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.080
in the face of the enemy.

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.080
I'll be blunt.

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:26.040
You know, we were calling for him to use the insurrection act all through the summer.

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:29.760
Um, he did not do it and he brought him to the last moment.

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:30.760
He could have done it.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:31.760
Yeah.

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:37.940
You sound, I mean, I, I, his, his response is like as expected as it, you could, it could

01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:39.560
be for someone like Stuart Rhodes.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:40.560
He's disappointed.

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:41.560
Yeah.

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:44.760
Cause he has been very clearly calling for Trump.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:49.160
We wanted to overthrow the government and institute a theocracy.

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:53.880
He's straight up been on Info Wars talking about how Trump needs to deputize him and

01:21:53.880 --> 01:22:00.200
all of his buddies, the militias, call them up to restore order in the country.

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.200
Yeah.

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.200
Yeah.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.200
He, of course he's disappointed.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.200
He was really excited.

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:08.080
This was as close as he was probably ever going to get to a president being like, yep,

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.480
you guys are my army now.

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.480
Yup.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.480
Yup.

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:15.980
That's about as a, yeah, he wanted a new Confederacy and he almost got it and now he's sad and

01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:22.880
I assume Alex texted him being like, Hey, the line is it wasn't you guys on purpose.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:25.920
And he was like, but I want to tell people that we should do it again.

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.840
Well he does have, he has an interesting take on what happened on the six and we'll get

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:33.260
to that in a little bit, but Alex certainly doesn't want to start with, yeah, he wants

01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:38.840
to start with Biden is a fake leader and because he's a fake leader, Stuart knows cause he's

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.680
a constitutional scholar.

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:43.600
He went to Yale.

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:46.520
Can you imagine how many lies are in history Dan?

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.520
Many.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:52.200
So Stuart, based on the constitution, he's just like, fuck it, we don't have to follow

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.200
laws now.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:57.160
I'll get plenty of hate mail for saying that and all kinds of people saying, you know,

01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:00.840
all the same excuses we've always heard, but he was surrounded by bad people.

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:01.840
Whose fault was that?

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:02.840
It's his own fault.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.560
And he's still a commander in chief or he was the commander in chief.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:08.360
He had a duty and responsibility to step up, but he failed to do that.

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:12.880
He allowed a Chi-Con puppet into the White House and I think we now need to just declare

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:17.120
that to be illegitimate and refuse to comply with anything that comes out of his mouth.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:22.320
Anything he signs, anything passed as so-called legislation, label it pretend legislation

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:23.880
like the founding fathers did.

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:26.560
Ha ha, rules are pretend now.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:27.560
Sweet.

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:28.560
Okay.

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:29.560
All right.

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:32.020
I got three Supreme Court justices who don't count anymore.

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:33.180
That's how we're going to do this.

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:34.180
That's how this rule works.

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:35.760
This is not functional.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:38.520
I get to choose who I think is the government.

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:39.520
Yeah.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.520
Yeah.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:44.400
This is not a way for a cohesive society to work.

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:48.480
And I mean, it makes sense because that's not their goal.

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:52.020
Their goal is not to have a coherent and cohesive society.

01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:53.640
It's time to declare independence.

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:54.640
Great.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:56.240
But he was not duly elected.

01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:00.200
It's just amazing that Trump will let the election be stolen out from under him and

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:03.860
then let our country be stolen like this, our government.

01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:08.000
So we have to now prepare to walk the path of the founding fathers, where your independence

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.160
from that illegitimate regime.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:14.400
We still defend the constitution, but they're the ones that are the Ursipers and the violators.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:15.400
And you-

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:16.400
I'm sorry.

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:17.400
And then get strong in your communities.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.920
You need to be raising local militias in your towns and counties.

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:24.320
And like the founders did, you need to then nullify, refuse to comply, and when they come

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.320
for you, you defend yourselves.

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:27.320
But you got to do it together.

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:28.320
Okay.

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.320
Okay.

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.800
So commit crimes and kill cops when they try and arrest you.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:32.800
I guess.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.120
I think they're pretend laws.

01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:35.120
I...

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:36.120
Man.

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:37.120
Oh boy.

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:38.120
I'm gonna-

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:39.120
What?

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.280
What pretend laws?

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:41.280
By this point, I'm-

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.280
What pretend laws?

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:46.320
I would like to know specifically which ones are pretend and which ones are not pretend.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:51.480
Anything that has Biden's signature on it, his Hancock on it.

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:52.480
Okay.

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.480
That's fake.

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.480
All right.

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:55.480
Look.

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:56.480
Sure.

01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:00.600
I can't say enough how stressed out I was when I was listening to this because I got

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:06.280
really caught with a left hook out of nowhere by Harrison's overt racism and anti-Semitism.

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:08.440
I was surprised by the white nationalism, yeah.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:13.680
That made going through his shit much more of a slog than I expected, and it made it

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:15.240
like...

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.240
It was taxing.

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:21.640
And then at the same time, it filled me with all kinds of thoughts about like, all right,

01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:25.160
I guess the morning show on Info Wars now is just like...

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:26.160
White nationalist happy hour.

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:27.160
Speak freely.

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:29.160
Speak freely big at time.

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:30.160
Yeah.

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:33.600
And that seemed like a bad direction for things to be going.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:38.200
Then you get into Info Wars itself, like Alex's show, and you got Stuart Rhodes coming in

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:42.860
and it's just like frank discussion about like, the government isn't real.

01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:43.860
We need to secede.

01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:44.860
Yeah.

01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:45.860
Yeah.

01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:49.920
And this is doubling into the talk on Harrison's show about creating these enclaves where you

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:52.000
can protect yourself from the America.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.800
Sundown towns are great.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:56.120
It's fucked up.

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:59.560
Don't they already have white nationalist compounds in the Pacific Northwest?

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:03.000
Like entire cities that are like, no, it's whites only here.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.440
And everybody's just like, it's the Pacific Northwest.

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:06.560
I guess you guys do that.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:13.240
I don't know enough to know for sure, but I believe I've heard, at least unofficially

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:16.640
there are some places that have that character.

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.600
So one thing that Stuart is clear on is that he's gotten the memo.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:21.600
Sure.

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:22.600
We got a shit on Q people.

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:23.600
Right.

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.400
But the Q people, I mean, only silver lining in all this is maybe the Q people will finally

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:32.880
shut up because all they did the entire time, even up until last night, because, Oh no,

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:35.040
the trips were there to arrest the bad guys.

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:37.400
That's delusional nonsense.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:42.920
Q was an absolute psyop and well done one, what they call a lullaby to get you all to

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:46.800
be lulled into a false sense of security and, and just be asleep.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.440
That's what happened for four years.

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:53.120
You had people sitting on their hands, doing nothing, waiting, saying, trust the plan,

01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.860
waiting for this miraculous day that never came.

01:26:55.860 --> 01:27:01.240
It was a masterful, uh, sign up, but now you're going to wake up, smell the coffee and realize

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:02.400
now you got to do it the hard way.

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:03.400
You got to do it the same way.

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:07.200
The founding fathers did, you know, who else was sitting on their hands, doing nothing

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:12.700
for a long time, who people like Alex and Stuart Rhodes, like, you know, these people

01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:17.400
who thought that they had something that they could gain from Q Anon until it got to a point

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:20.700
where they realized, Nope, I can't gain anything from this.

01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:24.880
And now they sound like people, uh, who we are associated with.

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:29.760
Like all of a sudden they're pretending that people who have maybe more left politics,

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:34.560
uh, people like the guys at Q Anon Anonymous haven't been like banging the drum for a long

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:40.800
time talking about the dangers and the misleading nature of Q Anon.

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:43.100
Like I have no patience for this.

01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:48.480
You guys have all just jumped onto this now because you realize, well, that's our stick

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.480
to beat.

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:50.480
That's our scapegoat.

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:56.060
And there's a good chance that we can bring in some of the people, uh, anyone who hasn't

01:27:56.060 --> 01:28:00.680
already decided that Alex Jones is controlled opposition because of Q Anon, maybe we can

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:02.800
get them into our revenue streams.

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:07.040
Isn't the implication of his argument though, that he wanted more people there on the 6th

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.880
to overthrow the government?

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:19.320
No, because then Biden hadn't been inaugurated.

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.880
Well you got me.

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:25.400
No, Stuart doesn't want the overthrow of the government to have happened on the 6th.

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:30.640
What he's saying is that Q people, because they were lulled into a false sense of security,

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:34.800
did not show up on the 6th in order to overthrow the government like he wanted.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:40.000
I mean, I think that you could read his comments and maybe some of even like Alex's comments

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.560
that way, but I don't think that that's a totally fair reading.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:48.320
I think it's a possible reading, but I think it's more like the way that they intend it

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:51.800
is more like there's organizing that you could do.

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:56.600
There's information warfare you could engage in that you were lulled into a false sense

01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:57.800
of security about.

01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:00.860
You thought Trump was bulletproof, but there's other things you could, you could have been

01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:03.320
banging on doors in Georgia.

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.560
I think that that's what they want you to hear.

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:06.560
Yeah.

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:07.860
Dan, you are fair.

01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:11.960
I am very much unfair and I'm telling you right now, he wished there were more people

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:12.960
on the 6th.

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:15.320
Look, that's the dynamic of the show.

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:20.120
Anyway, speaking of the 6th, Alex finally gets around to asking about that and oh boy.

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:22.800
Give me your take on what happened to the Capitol.

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:25.160
I mean, we got set up there bad.

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:29.600
Well, sure, but I think it's, I think it's, I see it like this.

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:34.720
Yes, there were provocateurs that made sure the doors were wide open, but I think it's

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:39.200
important for all of us not to use the rhetoric of the left, condemn everyone that walked

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:44.960
in the Capitol as you know, storming the castle or storming the Capitol and, and, and engaging

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:45.960
the insurrection.

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:49.040
We should just say, look at the most they were trespassing.

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:53.440
Stuart Rhodes has a lot riding on people believing that people who were at the Capitol were just

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.400
trespassing at worst.

01:29:55.400 --> 01:30:00.680
You see, unlike Antifa, the Oath Keepers are a group that exists and Stuart Rhodes is the

01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:01.680
head of it.

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:05.400
They have a website where you can donate to them and everything and they have an online

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.600
store where you can buy official merch.

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:12.100
It's an actual group and it kind of looks bad when three members of the group get arrested

01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:16.660
after storming the Capitol and their charging document lays out how they planned for weeks

01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:21.040
in advance in order to, in theory, kill members of Congress.

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:24.080
It took a lot of planning to trespass, it looks like.

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:25.080
Yeah.

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:31.160
Thomas Caldwell, Jessica Watkins and Donovan Kroll are all Oath Keepers from Ohio and they're

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:33.480
going to prison for a long time.

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:37.120
According to an article in the Daily Beast, Caldwell stands accused of organizing a group

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:42.000
of eight people to aggressively disrupt the certification of the Electoral College vote.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.520
The group used Facebook and the walkie-talkie Abzello to communicate, which is really fucking

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:51.200
stupid because now the FBI has all that shit, including them messaging with someone on Facebook

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:55.560
who is apparently encouraging them to kill members of Congress, saying, quote, all members

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.440
are in the tunnels under the Capitol.

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.440
Seal them in.

01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:59.800
Turn on gas.

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:05.740
Bill Gates is going to inject us all with computer chips to know where we are at all

01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:12.480
times so we need to protect ourselves by using unencrypted apps while in the Capitol.

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:16.400
After leaving the Capitol, Caldwell posted on Facebook, quote, Proud Boys scuffled with

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:19.640
cops and drove them inside to hide, breached the doors.

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:22.800
One guy made it all the way to the House floor, another to Pelosi's office.

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.040
A good time.

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:25.840
We need to do this on the local level.

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:27.600
Let's storm the Capitol in Ohio.

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.240
Tell me when.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:33.180
In this individual case, Stewart's personal hands may be clean.

01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:37.160
One of the messages that the FBI had in the charging document was Caldwell saying, quote,

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:41.640
I don't know if Stewie has even gotten out his call to arms, but it's a little frickin'

01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:42.640
late.

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.160
This one we're doing on our own.

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:46.520
We'll link up with a North Carolina crew.

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:47.520
Oh, man.

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:49.520
Stewart read that and was like, boom!

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:50.520
I'm free!

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:51.520
Yeah.

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:52.520
I get...

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:53.520
Yeah.

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:57.240
Thank God they said that shit.

01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.240
Whee!

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:01.920
I guess you could say that the best case scenario for Stewart Rhodes is to say that he's responsible

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:06.240
for starting a decentralized right-wing extremist militia organization that he has so little

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:11.340
control over that now it's being used by members to plan militaristic takeovers of state and

01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:12.880
federal capitol buildings.

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:17.960
Also, he might be in hot water, because the charging document for those Oath Keepers does

01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:23.600
include a charge of conspiracy, and it explicitly alleges that they, quote, conspired together

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:28.880
and with others whose identities are known and unknown to law enforcement at this time.

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:29.880
Oh, boy.

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:33.280
That's not a great sentence to see when you're the head of an organization that these people

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:36.760
who were going to jail for a very long time were conspiring in.

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:43.120
What I'm saying is, I would still be worried if I were Stewart, even though that, you know,

01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.920
the Stewie thing is pretty good for him.

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:50.720
Hey, Don, a lot of our generals flipped, and you're in the RICO case.

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:51.760
Is this good?

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:52.760
Is this good or bad?

01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:53.760
Yeah.

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:54.760
Yeah.

01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:57.760
He has stuff to be concerned about, and it's probably his best play to pretend that people

01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:58.760
are just trespassing.

01:32:58.760 --> 01:32:59.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:00.760
It's probably his best interests.

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:01.760
And they were just trespassing.

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:02.760
Hey, it's no big deal.

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:07.280
I mean, sure, they had to push through some barricades and kill a girl.

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:08.280
It's no big deal.

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:09.280
Yeah.

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:12.320
So, like, we have a couple of Oath Keepers members that were in there.

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:15.600
When they establish a defense fund, we'll contribute to it.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.120
They did not do that under my orders.

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:21.920
They did that contrary to our plan for the day, which is just to PSD details and protect

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:22.920
events.

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:26.080
That's what we were there to do and protect individual Trump supporters from the radicals

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:28.400
in the streets, like we've always done.

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:32.720
But I'm not going to chuck them under the bus and condemn them as horrible people or

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:35.200
traitors or any kind of nonsense like that.

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:37.240
Too many on the right are adopting the same.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:38.240
Yeah, no.

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:41.400
The police opened the doors after a few people knocked out some of the windows.

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:44.520
They were ordered to suck in enough people to have a crowd.

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:45.520
Stuart, don't you understand?

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:47.120
We already have the narrative.

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:48.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:49.520
Yeah.

01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:52.840
You have your own personal issues, and I understand how you don't want to throw your people under

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:55.280
the bus, but they are going to jail for a long time.

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:56.280
Long time.

01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:57.520
And, hey, that's tough.

01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:58.600
I feel for you.

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:04.400
Infos has a narrative, and I'm not going to stray from it at all, not for your ass.

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:09.360
Hey, buddy, you can thread the fine needle of it's good that they overthrew the Capitol,

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:10.960
but it's bad that they lost.

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:12.120
You can do that all you want.

01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:13.120
I wish you the best.

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.120
Yeah, have fun.

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:15.120
Have fun.

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:17.120
You're also probably going to jail.

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:24.000
So Jordan, Stuart Rhodes has some interesting ideas about cancel culture.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.080
I find that hard to believe.

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:32.480
Apparently, I don't know exactly what the root is, how you get there from point A to

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:38.880
point C, but you start with cancel culture, then things get out of control.

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:40.700
Are we going to get back into white genocide?

01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:41.700
Mass graves.

01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:42.700
Okay.

01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:43.700
People dead in ditches.

01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:44.700
Okay.

01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:49.280
He'll play the good cop and say, we come in peace, but they really come for war.

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:56.200
Stuart Rhodes, what do you expect from the left now?

01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:02.160
Are going to follow through with cancel culture, and it ends in a ditch.

01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:04.400
It's where it's going to end if you don't stop it.

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:08.640
It ends in a ditch full of bodies, which is what the communists have done throughout their

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:09.640
history.

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:12.280
I mean, in fact, there's a state rep from New Mexico that's calling for all of us to

01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:17.400
be tattooed, if you were a Trump supporter, to be tattooed with a mark that's visible

01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:19.380
so they will know who you are.

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:24.000
So we need to understand that it's far worse than the founding fathers faced.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.040
Citation needed on that New Mexico state rep.

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:32.260
So if I understand correctly, if Toobin can't rub one out in a meeting, we're all going

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:33.260
to mass graves.

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:37.760
Yeah, you remember how Mao got rid of his political opponents by bringing up blog posts

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:38.760
they'd written.

01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:39.760
Yeah, absolutely.

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:40.760
They'd written.

01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:41.760
Yeah, yeah.

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:42.760
Yeah.

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:48.400
That was the main source of issues for the Cultural Revolution, I'm pretty sure, right?

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:49.800
Oh, God.

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:50.800
Okay.

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:58.560
I just can't stand this overly dramatic person making these petty complaints, simultaneously

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:04.840
being the leader of a fucking militia, where people did storm the Capitol and seemed to

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.640
have pretty nefarious intent.

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:08.000
I get it.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:14.500
You know, like when you're so used to having uncontrollable and impenetrable privilege

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:20.240
your entire life and the lives of your forebears, I get that the idea of equality is threatening

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:21.240
to you.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.240
Sure.

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:27.320
But let's just remind ourselves that at best from a Biden presidency, we're going to get

01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:29.640
a little bit more equal.

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:32.720
It's not going to change too much for white people.

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:33.720
Yeah.

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:34.720
And I think-

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:35.720
It's just not.

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:42.280
And I think that you'll see more coherent and more sincere aggressive critique and action

01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:43.280
from the left.

01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.280
100%.

01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:52.720
I think you will see more organizing against or in order to push policy for Biden from

01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:54.160
the left than you will from the right.

01:36:54.160 --> 01:37:00.240
You'll see culture war nonsense and just a bunch of aggrievement from the right and you'll

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:05.920
see an attempt to form more coherent social policy on the left.

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:12.840
I find it hard to think that, you know, like watching Portland happen just recently-

01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:13.840
Since the inauguration.

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:19.440
Yeah, since the inauguration, watching the way the cops reacted, it struck me that more

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:23.760
likely what we're going to see from the Capitol riot is not that people are going to go back

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:27.220
to DC, but that cops are going to fuck people up at home.

01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:32.000
You know, like the DC overthrow is going to everybody's home and it's cops fucking people

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000
up.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.880
Oh, and there's that video out of Tacoma of the police car driving through a bunch of

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:37.880
people.

01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:38.880
Yeah.

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:40.800
That's the legacy of the sixth.

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:45.640
I think it's entirely possible and I think that there will also be the other legacy and

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:50.880
that is I think that there will be a lot of people who end up going to prison or who at

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:56.320
least get charged with a bunch of stuff and I think that we may or may not hear follow-ups

01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:01.360
on a lot of it, but I think a lot of people are going to be jammed up for that.

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:05.760
And hey, three of them are Stuart Rhodes' militia members at least.

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:12.400
Yeah, it's unfortunate that the people who created the conditions are absolutely not

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:13.720
going to face any...

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.720
Rico.

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:15.720
Yeah.

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:16.720
I mean, yeah.

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:21.160
Anyway, Stuart believes that Trump, you know that guy?

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.720
Last sitting president who was real.

01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:24.720
Okay.

01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:25.720
Okay.

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:26.720
All right.

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:30.280
That said, there is a potential for future elections to...

01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:31.280
No!

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.280
Yep.

01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:33.280
Future elections...

01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.280
Sorry.

01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.000
They can go well.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Okay.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.040
But there's something that needs to happen for these elections to go well and that is

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:43.200
paper ballots, but also...

01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.200
I'm fine with paper.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:45.200
I'm happy with paper ballots.

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:46.200
Hold on.

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.200
I like paper ballots.

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.200
Hold on.

01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:49.200
That's just the beginning.

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.200
That's a good beginning.

01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:51.200
There's a second step to this that is ludicrous.

01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:53.120
I don't know how I feel about the second step.

01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:57.480
Anything else you'd like to add in about 30 seconds we have left?

01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:00.520
We no longer have a legitimate president.

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:01.520
This is...

01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:03.960
Trump was the last actual sitting legitimate president.

01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:07.760
We will see if we can ever have one again that's going to require paper ballots.

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:11.140
At any local elections, you must insist on paper ballots if they won't do it.

01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:15.560
You hold your own parallel election using paper ballots to prove that your patriot candidate

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:16.560
did win.

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.200
Make sure you have a way to prove that.

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:23.320
And from bottom to top, bottom up is how you take it back.

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.560
That's right, Stuart.

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:26.560
How do you do that?

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:28.720
How do you run a second election?

01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:34.680
I think the funniest thing about that is that the only people who would be furious at the

01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:39.440
results of us going to entirely paper ballots would be these people.

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.000
I have zero doubt in my mind that if we were using paper ballots, Stacey Abrams would have

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.200
been governor of Georgia.

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:47.200
Zero doubt.

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:48.200
I would...

01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:49.200
I don't know.

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:50.200
I don't know.

01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:51.200
Maybe.

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:57.200
I don't know what I think entirely would change because I don't believe that there's rank

01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:01.080
corruption of electronic voting.

01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:06.880
I think that there's problems with gerrymandering and access to polling places.

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:10.160
And I don't know if that would be fully solved by paper ballots.

01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:11.160
I would doubt it.

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:20.040
I would say that one thing that would be even more helpful than paper ballots would be having

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:25.920
a holiday for elections, having multiple days that people can vote, which are things that

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:32.440
people are doing, that we're making progress towards, and also expanding access to remote

01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:33.440
voting.

01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:38.360
Keeping Republicans away from how many polling places are allowed in, let's say, majority

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.240
black neighborhoods.

01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:45.240
And not letting people like Stuart's friends hang around outside in the fifties.

01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:46.240
That's a good one.

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.240
That's a good one.

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:48.240
I like that one too.

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.920
These things would make more progress than paper ballots.

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:55.360
But I will say that one thing that is stupid is the idea that what you should do, if you

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.720
can't have paper ballots, is run a second election.

01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:03.640
I think a parallel election would teach people a lot about how you would want to steal it.

01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:08.280
Here's a really good way that that process could get subverted and you'd never know it.

01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:09.280
How?

01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:10.280
So you're running a second election.

01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:11.280
Sure.

01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:15.260
I go ahead and vote differently in those two.

01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:17.600
How would you ever know?

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:22.080
Well, because it would also be run by the Georgia election commission.

01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:25.480
Why would they ever do that?

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:30.040
Well, because right wing nut jobs want it.

01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:38.560
No, he's talking about like the oath keepers running their own election.

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:39.560
So dumb.

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:42.800
I think they should have the UN come in to observe the results of the election.

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:44.240
I think these guys would love that.

01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:46.000
They'd love it.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:52.240
So Stuart leaves and Alex, earlier, Stuart had said that Trump is a disappointment.

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.240
He failed.

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:57.800
He didn't step up when Judy called and all these people are going to be going around

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:01.320
and saying that, hey, he was surrounded and making excuses for him.

01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:06.760
Like Alex and Roger Stone and Steve Pachannik and Jerome Corsi.

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:07.760
No, no, no.

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:09.920
Alex immediately after Stuart leaves.

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:10.920
Oh, okay.

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:11.920
Okay.

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:13.200
And I respect Stuart Rhodes, the oath keepers.

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:17.800
He was on last segment here on the Alex Jones show last hour.

01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:21.440
And he was saying, you think Trump really failed by not declaring the insurrection act.

01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:26.440
Well, Bob Barnes was a lawyer for Trump and was in some of the meetings and they were

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:32.320
planning to have the military arrest Trump if he did that, even though it was lawful.

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.160
And so Trump was totally surrounded.

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:37.960
Oh, so it sounds like you're the kind of person who Stuart was talking about having no patience

01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:38.960
for it.

01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:39.960
Yeah.

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:40.960
Yep.

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:41.960
Yep.

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:42.960
Yep.

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:46.400
You're being a narcissistic shithead on inauguration day.

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:51.400
I'm just, I've always tried to steer you as accurate as I can with the best info I have

01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:57.440
with real research and real historical understanding and quote sources.

01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:03.840
But I'll tell you most of the time I know more than my sources, what the Pentagon calls

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:04.840
me up.

01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:09.320
The CIA calls me up to ask what I think of things.

01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:10.320
Not the other way around.

01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:13.040
I'm not trying to brag about that folks, but I have a good political brain.

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:14.840
I've been doing this a long time.

01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:21.560
I've been trained in the field, in the school of hard knots as an organic Patriot citizen

01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:24.320
who wasn't trained by the system.

01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:31.080
Matt is seen by the system as the proof of someone's real gravitas is that they pull

01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.200
themselves up out of the mud.

01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:38.040
And I'm not telling you that to act powerful.

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:44.060
I'm telling you that because that's the reality, ladies and gentlemen, now let's shift gears

01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:45.360
into Lady Gaga.

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:46.960
Those pills might be kicking in.

01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:47.960
Yeah.

01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:48.960
Let's shift gears into Lady Gaga.

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:50.440
I think that's good.

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:53.520
They really do respect people who pull themselves up.

01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:55.880
How did Alex get his first show again?

01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:57.120
His dad bought an ad.

01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:58.120
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:43:58.120 --> 01:43:59.120
Yeah.

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:00.120
Yeah.

01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:01.120
Radio station.

01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:04.800
One of the other things I think is really funny is like just imagining just any other

01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:09.560
show where like somebody interviews somebody about like Medicare policy or something like

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:10.560
that.

01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:11.560
And then they're like, you know what?

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:19.200
I know way more about Medicare than these assholes that I have on.

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:20.640
Rest in peace to Larry King.

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:25.400
If only he had a few broadcasts where he's just like, man, all these people that I talked

01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:26.760
to are fucking stupid.

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:32.400
The government calls me up for what I think about things.

01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:39.200
In any context other than Alex Jones, it becomes so clear how rude it is, how unprofessional

01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:40.200
it is.

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:42.920
But for Alex, it's just like, yeah, this is the kind of dickhead that he is.

01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:47.240
I mean, if you have an M.O. for long enough, people will just be like, fine.

01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:48.240
Yeah.

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:54.360
Also, speaking of which, with Larry King, I was reminded on his passing, and a lot of

01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:55.360
people posted the clip.

01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:56.360
Dick Rubin?

01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:57.360
Yes.

01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:58.360
Yeah.

01:44:58.360 --> 01:44:59.360
I was glad they did.

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:00.360
That's a good one.

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:03.260
And if you haven't seen it, go check that out.

01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:05.280
Larry King was on with Dave Rubin.

01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:11.040
They were doing a live broadcast, and Larry King answered a call from his son.

01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:12.600
It was incredibly rude.

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:13.600
It was beautiful.

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:14.600
It was beautiful.

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:15.600
It went on forever.

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:16.600
It was beautiful.

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:18.600
Dave Rubin is so pissed.

01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:19.600
Lovely.

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.720
One of the best things ever.

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:22.720
I love it.

01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:24.560
So Robert Barnes shows up now.

01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:25.560
Cool.

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.600
We got to have some constitutional law to tell us why.

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.600
Well, we already did.

01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:29.600
Oh, that's right.

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:30.600
I'm a constitutional expert.

01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:31.720
Stuart Rhodes telling me about the Constitution.

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:32.720
That's right.

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:34.400
He's just basically there to shit on Q more.

01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:36.960
I think that that's Barnes' new thing.

01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:38.960
His new branding is anti-Q guy.

01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:39.960
I like it.

01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:40.960
That's a good rebrand.

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:41.960
Sure.

01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:42.960
Whatever.

01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:45.800
But he also has an idea for what Trump needs to do now that he's out of office.

01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:51.000
I think Trump's great skill is his marketing, and his great asset is his brand.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:56.360
And so he should leverage both to look at an independent news media network, independent

01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:01.440
information distribution network, independent social media platforms, maybe even look at

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:04.400
independent banks and financial institutions.

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:08.960
The reality is there's there's going to be huge demand for all of those things from people

01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:13.640
that are our Trump supporters because of the censorship campaigns and the blacklisting

01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:19.980
campaigns by the institutional media, by employment institutions, by financial institutions, by

01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:21.980
the social media oligarchs.

01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:27.500
The only way to counteract that is to have our own networks to do to replicate and repeat

01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:29.400
what Infowars has done.

01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:36.400
Build an independent brand that's not dependent at all either on corporate donations or sugar

01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:41.600
daddy billionaires, but also isn't dependent on big tech distribution platforms either.

01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:46.280
The Infowars is the model and the template for the president to mirror and follow in

01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:48.460
a broader context of industry.

01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:53.120
I'm not sure that I would want to be involved with a bank that's modeled after Infowars.

01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:56.380
I don't think I would feel confident having my money held by people who are constantly

01:46:56.380 --> 01:46:59.560
ranting about the devil and how they might be out of business next week.

01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:00.560
I don't know.

01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:03.760
There are some good financial advisors.

01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:09.320
I think that those business models are, especially ones like, you know, banks.

01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:11.920
A lot of that has to do with confidence.

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:17.360
That's one of the things that will go a long way in terms of making investors and depositors

01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:20.040
not make a rush on their money trying to get it out.

01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:23.200
I think that Alex is, uh, maybe...

01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:24.320
Here's what I want to do.

01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:28.640
I want to put my money in a bank that screams at me about how the government is going to

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:30.640
take my money away from that bank.

01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:31.640
Right.

01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:34.680
Also, is this independent bank going to be involved in the FDIC?

01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:39.560
Also, if you're telling me that you want a social network started by Trump without a

01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:44.080
fucking daddy billionaire, you know what?

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:45.080
It's a little incoherent.

01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.840
You know, um, yeah.

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:47.840
It's all a little incoherent.

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:52.600
They're functionally, like, his plan is functionally, let's secede from reality entirely.

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:53.600
Yes.

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:59.000
We don't have to live in, look, we can't leave the country because it's land, but our brains

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.000
can secede.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Yeah.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:06.120
We will create a media ecosystem, which you've already done a lot of legwork on with InfoWars

01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:11.760
and Newsmax and OAN, and Trump has, you know, certainly elevated all these things.

01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:14.520
We'll create online spaces for us to interact.

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:17.200
We'll create, um...

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:21.760
You know, this would remind me a lot, and I don't think Barnes would like it too much.

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:27.840
If this were actually enacted, I think it would remind me more of, like, the mining

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:34.480
towns in the 1890s and early 1900s where the guy who owned the mine also printed your money.

01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:35.480
Right.

01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:36.480
Owned your home.

01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:37.720
Ran everything there.

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:38.720
Printed the newspaper.

01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:40.480
I'm not positive that Barnes wouldn't like that.

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:43.080
I mean, that's basically libertarian fantasy land.

01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:44.080
Yeah, that's true.

01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:47.280
Well, I think a lot of people would love it if they were the owner of the mine.

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:49.960
See, that's what they think.

01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:50.960
And that is...

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:52.760
I'm gonna get my own mine.

01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:59.240
Well, to an extent, I think people like Barnes and Alex are at a level of society where they

01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:03.280
view themselves as being okay in a libertarian landscape.

01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:04.280
Like that.

01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:08.180
Like that mining town, they would either be the person who runs the mine or somebody who's

01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:10.600
an associate of the person who runs the mine.

01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:11.600
So they're fine.

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:12.600
They're gonna be a monkey, Mike.

01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:13.600
They aren't the miners.

01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:14.600
You don't want to grow.

01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:15.600
You don't want to be a miner.

01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:16.600
Right.

01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:20.040
So they, you know, obviously that's the society that they would like to see and they would

01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:21.040
like to build.

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:24.640
I'm going to tell you right now, a society built around people who don't want to work

01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:27.480
in the mine, but all want to own it.

01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:28.480
Not a good one.

01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:29.480
It's functional.

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:30.480
Hmm.

01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:35.040
So Barnes, like I said, most of it is complaining about QAnon, which is just becoming annoying

01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:36.040
at this point.

01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:37.040
Yeah.

01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:41.240
And so he leaves and Alex, he said this and I got pretty excited.

01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:42.240
Here's a short compilation.

01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:45.380
We've got like a 20 minute one, but here's a minute and a half compilation of them calling

01:49:45.380 --> 01:49:50.720
for reprogramming, reeducation camps of the American people.

01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:53.100
So Alex is going to play that compilation.

01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:57.220
You know, I was curious cause I hadn't heard him play those clips, but he keeps talking

01:49:57.220 --> 01:49:58.220
about it.

01:49:58.220 --> 01:49:59.220
Yeah.

01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:02.000
So I decided that what I was going to do is I was going to look into each clip.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.120
Do it.

01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:04.120
Here's the deal.

01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:05.120
Okay.

01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:08.480
I took this compilation clip by clip and I found the context for each of them and I found

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:12.320
that none of them really had anything to do with putting conservatives in camps or anything

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:13.320
even close.

01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:15.400
And I was thinking like, what the fuck is going on?

01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:17.480
I spent a long time sorting this out.

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:20.000
And then at the end of the compilation, it didn't matter.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.060
Cause Alex said this, Oh, the enemy is the American people.

01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:24.280
So that's another compilation.

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:25.280
Sorry.

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:26.280
We heard the wrong one.

01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:27.280
Go fuck yourself.

01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:29.680
I wasted so much time.

01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:30.680
Sorry.

01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:31.680
Yeah.

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:32.680
Sorry.

01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:35.500
It turns out the compilation that I was talking about doesn't exist.

01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:39.320
That's the equivalent in my world of like me slipping on a banana peel.

01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:40.320
Yeah.

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:42.200
That's that's Lucy holding the football.

01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:43.200
Yeah.

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:44.200
Yeah.

01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:47.720
Alex just pulled it away forever and ever, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:49.360
Charlie Brown, what are we talking about?

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:50.360
Somebody said camps.

01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:51.360
All right.

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:52.720
Now, now, now Barnes, we did get one of the clips.

01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:53.720
It's not the crew's fault.

01:50:53.720 --> 01:51:01.200
There's so many brainwash reeducate kill firing squad, uh, reprogram, but I wanted to just

01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:05.480
show one of the clips about reeducation camps because that's where they're going with this.

01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:06.480
Here it is.

01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:14.280
And Harvard now want to set up kind of a reeducation camps and moral rehabilitation centers and

01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:21.880
institutions for vetting people who had the chutzpah to work in the Trump administration.

01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:22.880
That's right.

01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:23.880
And that's him criticizing.

01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:25.400
We've got a bunch of clips that we'll add in post.

01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:28.840
We add this to live and where they actually say it.

01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:29.840
Yeah.

01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:31.160
So I guess Barnes is still around, but who cares?

01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:32.160
Yeah.

01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:35.180
Alex breaks into the air interview to say that he did find her on the clips, but unfortunately

01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:38.720
it's not a leftist saying they want to put conservatives in camps.

01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:41.760
It's just another right winger complaining about his fear that leftists are going to

01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:43.240
put conservatives in camps.

01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:44.240
Yeah.

01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:45.240
Yeah.

01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:48.420
This is noted Epstein lawyer, Alan Dershowitz complaining about Harvard students starting

01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:53.360
a petition to encourage the school to not hire anyone who worked for the Trump administration.

01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:55.280
This doesn't help Alex's point and guess what?

01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:56.960
That's a clip from November.

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:59.040
How does the Dersh get allowed on TV?

01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:00.040
I don't know.

01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:01.040
I don't understand.

01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:02.040
I don't know, but that's the best.

01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:03.040
What's wrong with people?

01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:04.040
That's the best they could do.

01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:08.200
What's really interesting about that is that Alex is supposedly in possession of hundreds

01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:09.200
of these clips.

01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:10.200
Yeah.

01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:14.080
He breaks in with this clip after playing the wrong compilation.

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:15.080
Yep.

01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:16.680
I don't know if he has all these clips.

01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:17.680
He does not.

01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:18.680
There are not then.

01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:19.680
Yeah.

01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:20.680
Because they don't exist.

01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:23.120
So Alex is kind of bored.

01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:24.120
Yeah.

01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:25.120
Because...

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:27.160
Inauguration really isn't that big of a deal.

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.160
No.

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:30.320
And it also was shorter than he thought it was going to be.

01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:31.320
Yeah.

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:33.600
Biden didn't make any real serious gaffes.

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:35.320
And Alex is a little bit disappointed.

01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:36.320
Alright.

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:40.080
I think terror attacks should happen any time something happens, turn your phone on, brother.

01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:41.440
We're going to be live until 10 o'clock tonight.

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:42.440
Thank you so much.

01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:46.400
So yeah, there should have been attacks any time now.

01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.560
I'm pretty sure he's very disappointed nobody attacked the Capitol.

01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:51.560
Yeah.

01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:52.560
Yeah.

01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:54.840
Or around the country at some other state house or something.

01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:58.920
He's pretty much like, that's the whole reason we were going to do an all-day thing.

01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:00.960
Because I thought my buddies were going to start fires.

01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:02.960
I predicted false flags.

01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:03.960
Yeah.

01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:04.960
Come on, man.

01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:07.200
So it goes on a little bit longer.

01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:08.320
Alex is spinning his wheels.

01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:09.560
There's nothing really going on.

01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:10.920
It's very boring.

01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:11.920
I think they...

01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:13.520
We haven't had a false flag yet today.

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:14.520
Maybe it's going to happen.

01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:15.520
I pray it doesn't.

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:16.520
They were certainly saying what was coming.

01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:17.520
I think we put so much attention on this.

01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:18.520
Who was?

01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:22.480
And told patriots, don't go out and demonstrate on the 20th that we may have dodged a bullet.

01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:23.480
That's knock on wood.

01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:24.480
Yeah.

01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:31.720
So, you know, we stopped it from happening by saying it, but so, so awful.

01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:32.720
Yeah.

01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:42.360
Alex has Matt Bracken on, noted race war predictor Matt Bracken, noted shoddy Diagram fan Matt

01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:49.840
Bracken, noted ebook about race war salesman Matt Bracken.

01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:53.320
He's on and the two of them have a largely unproductive conversation.

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:57.640
And I think Alex is so bored that he just leaves, like not in the same way as during

01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:59.080
his interview with Jason Jones.

01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:00.080
Sure.

01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:01.080
But like mentally in his head.

01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:04.240
He's just like Bracken, you're doing a half hour.

01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:07.400
You take care of this until John Rappaport shows up.

01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:08.920
Alex just leaves.

01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:09.920
That's great.

01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:11.680
Bracken hosts for a little while and I don't give a shit.

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:15.720
And then John Rappaport shows up to host the fourth hour and this is where I turn things

01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:16.720
off.

01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:17.720
Okay.

01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:18.720
Hello everybody.

01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:19.720
John here.

01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:33.240
I thought I would celebrate the Biden inauguration by, uh, putting myself in a virtual loft as

01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:40.520
you can see behind me in a virtual city that is on virtual lockdown.

01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:49.360
And my refrigerator is stocked with virtual food because it was of course a virtual inauguration

01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:51.960
after a virtual election.

01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:53.680
Rappaport got a zoom background.

01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:56.040
This is riveting stuff.

01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:58.440
I can't believe how boring that is.

01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:04.080
That is the most bored I have been so fast in the shortest period of time.

01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:06.760
35 seconds for him to explain that he got a zoom background.

01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:08.680
That was brutally boring.

01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:09.680
Outrageous.

01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:10.680
That's terrifying.

01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:11.680
Inappropriate.

01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:12.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:13.680
It makes me, it makes me mad.

01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:14.680
Yeah.

01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:15.680
Yeah.

01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:21.200
Well, I could have probably kept going and listened to The War Room, although that's

01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:22.960
not a show that I normally listen to.

01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:23.960
True.

01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:28.920
Owen Schroyer is basically a less competent, broey version of Alex.

01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:29.920
Yeah.

01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:36.440
And I just, what I, what I got to by the end of Alex's show was this sort of sense that

01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:38.560
they're all disappointed.

01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:43.520
There's no real new talking points being developed in terms of like what happened on the sixth.

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:44.520
Yeah.

01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:45.520
Biden's a fake president.

01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:46.520
Whoop-dee-doo.

01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:49.080
This is all exactly the way they've been going.

01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:52.880
I didn't, I didn't have any faith that this was going to develop into anything interesting.

01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:53.880
Right.

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:58.760
Simultaneously, I didn't think that there was any chance that Owen's show could be any

01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:01.800
more offensive than the American Journal.

01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:07.540
I don't think that there could be anything that topped that in terms of the dangerousness,

01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:10.720
the offensiveness, the bigotedness.

01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:12.360
And the banality of it.

01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:13.360
True.

01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:15.600
And the banality of it was such a terrifying part.

01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:16.600
Yeah.

01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:20.000
It's always the scariest part where they're just like, we have to kill millions of people.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:21.480
Like just tossing it off.

01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:22.480
Yeah.

01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:23.480
Yeah.

01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:26.440
And so I kind of felt done with Inauguration Day.

01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:27.440
Sure.

01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:33.360
We saw some outrageous white nationalist slash supremacist slash neo-Nazi content in the

01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:34.520
morning show.

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:40.320
We saw Alex disappointed that his predictions of bombings and false flags didn't come true.

01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:44.480
And therefore he had no content on his own show.

01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:48.280
I just, oh, and Stuart Rhodes showed up.

01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:49.280
So I was done.

01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:50.280
Yeah.

01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:51.280
I was done.

01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:52.280
I think we got what we needed out of it.

01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:53.280
Yeah.

01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:56.360
I think Alex definitely didn't get what he wanted out of it, which was a lot of terror

01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:57.360
attacks.

01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:58.360
Yep.

01:56:58.360 --> 01:56:59.360
Yeah.

01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:00.360
I do think that that was something he was kind of hoping for.

01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:01.360
Yeah.

01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:04.680
Why else would you say we're going to do, look, if you're Info Wars and you're saying

01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:09.460
we're going to do a live 10 hour broadcast, that's not because you think the inauguration

01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:10.460
is going to go well.

01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:17.540
No, or that you have like something, some analysis or something to say, a breakdown

01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:21.160
of policy, a breakdown of like the agenda that Biden is setting out for in his first

01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:22.160
hundred days.

01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:24.080
You really want to get down into the nitty gritty.

01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:25.080
You want to get in the weeds.

01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:26.080
You want to be a policy wonk.

01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:27.080
He is a policy wonk.

01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:28.080
We all know he's a policy wonk.

01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:29.080
We all know that.

01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:31.080
He says it on our show like five times a show.

01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:32.080
All the time.

01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:33.080
Yeah.

01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:34.080
Yeah.

01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:35.080
Yeah.

01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:38.080
I don't think he has the ability to, nor the interest in it, and his audience wouldn't

01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:40.520
be at all motivated by it.

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:41.520
This is Info Wars.

01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:42.520
We want spectacle.

01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:43.520
Yes.

01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:44.520
And we want explosions.

01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:45.520
Yes.

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:48.800
And apparently we want a dork being a bigot.

01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:50.400
Yeah, I guess so.

01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:55.460
Anyway, we'll be back probably on Friday, I think, for another episode.

01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:57.880
Maybe a bonus little thing on Wednesday.

01:57:57.880 --> 01:57:59.080
Let's hope.

01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:05.420
But and then we'll discuss the fallout of Alex losing his Supreme Court in Texas appeal,

01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:08.200
which I think will be maybe interesting.

01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:09.200
Maybe not.

01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:10.200
Who knows?

01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:11.200
Yeah.

01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:12.200
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:13.200
We do have a website.

01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:14.200
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:15.200
We're also on Twitter.

01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:16.200
We are on Twitter.

01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:17.200
It's at knowledgefight.com.

01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:18.200
And I go to Betjordan.

01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:19.200
We're also on Facebook.

01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:20.200
We are Facebook.

01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:25.000
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to do God's work.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Yeah.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.000
We'll be back.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I'm Leo.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
I'm DZXclerk.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000
I got bad news for you, Harrison Smith.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
You have attracted my attention.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Andy in Kansas.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Thanks for being on the air.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Thanks for holding.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Hello, Alex.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.000
I'm a first time caller.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000
I'm a huge fan.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000
I love your work.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:59:10.000
I love you.
