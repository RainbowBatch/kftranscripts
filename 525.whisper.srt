00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,880
N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,360
I have great respect for knowledgefight.

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,360
Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,280
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:46,960
I am sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys saying

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:58,320
we are the bad guys saying we are the bad guys.

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,320
I love you.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,320
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm Jordan.

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,640
We're couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Alex Jones.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Oh indeed, we are Dan.

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
Jordan!

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Dan!

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
Jordan!

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Quick question for you.

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
What's up?

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
What's your bright spot today?

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,540
My bright spot today, Jordan, was getting to join you on your debut stream of your video

22
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,320
game channel over on Twitch.

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,320
Indeed.

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,040
You started playing Final Fantasy VII, it was a lot of fun to sit in and have very little

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,040
to say.

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,720
You are very offended when you do not have a sincere and large body of research from

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
which to call upon.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,160
It's a challenge for me to care.

29
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,400
Ah yes, there we go.

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
And I, look, you know.

31
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,320
I like you judging other people for caring.

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,480
I'm not judging you, I'm happy for you and I fully support you in this and all your endeavors.

33
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
I know.

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,080
I just can't care about watching this stupid video game.

35
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,600
I understand completely.

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
I understand completely.

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,080
I also don't like it being exposed that I probably didn't beat the game, though I thought

38
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,680
I did.

39
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
You came close enough.

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Oh god.

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,000
But yeah, it's really fun.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,920
I'm happy for you and congratulate you on the launching of your side project there.

43
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Yeah!

44
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,620
It was very enjoyable and everybody really had a good time and you were absolutely great.

45
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,520
How dare you act like you were, oh I was so terrible.

46
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
We had a grand old time.

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,320
I wasn't saying I was so terrible, I said I was so bored.

48
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
I will keep my mouth shut.

49
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Slight semantic difference.

50
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
Retracted.

51
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,320
Retracted, sir.

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,400
How about you?

53
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,600
My bright spot, Dan, is today my partner is getting her vaccine.

54
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
That's great.

55
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Yeah!

56
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,200
She's a teacher, she didn't even have to try and cheat her way in or lie to anybody.

57
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,160
She's getting her vaccine at the right time and I'm really happy for her.

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
That's fantastic.

59
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
Congratulations.

60
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Yeah, I'm very stoked.

61
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,880
I hope that the roll out continues and intensifies.

62
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,600
In at least May or June I'll be able to get it.

63
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
2022.

64
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Yeah, absolutely.

65
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,800
Once they get around to podcasters.

66
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Probably low on the list.

67
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,480
Yeah, she'll gladly watch me slowly fade away, I think that'll be...

68
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:16,120
Your partner is a teacher, like you said, so obviously there's much need for folks in

69
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,360
that line, much less so podcasters.

70
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Very...

71
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,160
So yeah, Jordan, I'm glad for that, and I wish you the best on your new exploration

72
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
of Midgar.

73
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,960
I'm gonna remember the name now.

74
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,180
That's true, you will remember Midgar.

75
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,560
So Jordan, today we got an interesting thing to talk about.

76
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Oh yeah?

77
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Interesting episode.

78
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
What's that?

79
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,560
We're gonna be talking about January 27th, 2021, Blackjack.

80
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,000
Ah, shit, you're so good.

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So fast.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,400
We're on the 27th, this is Wednesday of this week, and the reason that we are sort of jumping

83
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,080
ahead in time, our last episode was about the inauguration and Harrison Smith being

84
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
a...

85
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
Blatant bigot.

86
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Yeah.

87
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
Yeah.

88
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,480
And the reason is, hey, I'm Alex Jones, I'm sitting around, I'm thinking, the devil just

89
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,800
got into the White House.

90
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Sure.

91
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,040
The Texas Supreme Court has just ruled that I can be sued by the Sandy Hook families.

92
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Problem.

93
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm gonna go on vacation, man.

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Smart move.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,520
So Alex just leaves for Utah, which is a strange place to go, but whatever.

97
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,040
I like that the only time, every time he threatens a vacation, he never takes it.

98
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,240
The only time he does take a vacation is when his lawyers have clearly said, if you are

99
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,160
on the air, you will say something that hurts our case.

100
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,520
You need to chill.

101
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,840
Yeah, you gotta go away.

102
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,680
You gotta go to fucking Utah.

103
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,680
You gotta be in Utah right now.

104
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,600
Go see the Jazz, Rudy Gobert's having a great season.

105
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
Yeah, I don't know what he's doing in Utah, it doesn't seem like, I mean, nothing against

106
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Utah, I've been there.

107
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
It's a nice state.

108
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Yeah.

109
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
I like the Southwest quite a bit.

110
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
Eh, it's pretty.

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah.

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,280
So, I retract that.

113
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,520
It is a good place to go on vacation.

114
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
Yeah, it's a great place.

115
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Whatever.

116
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
It just seems strange.

117
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,160
Well, I mean, you know, too many places are dry, I suppose is the only argument I have.

118
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
There's a dry Salt Lake.

119
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,360
Oh, you mean too many places in Utah?

120
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
Yeah, yeah.

121
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Oh, yes, yes.

122
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Are alcohol-free.

123
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Oh, that too.

124
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Yes.

125
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
A lot of dry counties.

126
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,360
Yeah, a lot of dry counties.

127
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
I thought you meant it's arid there.

128
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
No.

129
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,680
No, I did not mean that.

130
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,920
So, yeah, Alex was out of studio and Owen Schroyer was hosting for a number of days

131
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,200
and I just don't care.

132
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,840
And so, I was considering maybe, like, let's check in and just do a Harrison Smith episode.

133
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,840
Sure.

134
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,840
But then, Wednesday, Alex hosted a good bit of his own show with Owen Schroyer riding

135
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,440
shotgun in the studio and something happened that requires our attention.

136
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,840
So we will be talking about that today and honestly, I think that there might be a sequel

137
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:48,400
to this on Monday's episode of our show because this appears to be something that might...

138
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,760
I am going to fight a bear on Friday this week.

139
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,600
Take away the bear.

140
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,080
We've got a charity boxing challenge?

141
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Take away...

142
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
Yep, we do.

143
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
We've got a charity boxing challenge.

144
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
There will be a bear knuckle boxing match.

145
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Okay, there we go.

146
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
Challenged.

147
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,400
How do I just guess these things, Dan?

148
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
I don't know.

149
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,000
There will be a bear knuckle boxing match challenged and then retracted at the end of

150
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
this episode.

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay.

152
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay.

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Alright, spoiler alert.

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's too soon.

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's too soon.

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,520
But there is a feeling that I have, I mean, we're recording this on Thursday and I have

157
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,560
some awareness of what happened on his show today, but I think that this is a narrative

158
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
that's continuing.

159
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,440
There's something that's going to continue into Monday's show without giving too much

160
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
away.

161
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,080
Everybody who's listening already fucking knows what I'm talking about.

162
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Of course.

163
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,800
So let's take a little moment before we get down to business, Jordan, to say thank you

164
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
to some folks who signed up and are supporting the show.

165
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,520
Oh, that's a great idea.

166
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,760
So first, Dr. Bingo, like Van Gogh.

167
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
Thank you so much.

168
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
You are now a policy wonk.

169
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
I'm a policy wonk.

170
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Thank you.

171
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Dr. Bingo.

172
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
Thank you very much, Dr. Bingo.

173
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Like Van Gogh.

174
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
Next, Brunisinde.

175
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Thank you so much.

176
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
You are now a policy wonk.

177
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
I'm a policy wonk.

178
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
Thank you.

179
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
Hey, thank you very much.

180
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
Next, I love you.

181
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
Thank you so much.

182
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

183
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
I love you.

184
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Thank you so much.

185
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
You are now a policy wonk.

186
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
I'm a policy wonk.

187
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,560
Thank you very much.

188
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,940
You are now a policy wonk.

189
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,940
I'm a policy wonk.

190
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,480
Thank you, Chad Rice.

191
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Thank you.

192
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Next, Leeland.

193
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Thank you so much.

194
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
You are now a policy wonk.

195
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
I'm a policy wonk.

196
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Thank you very much.

197
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,420
My favorite of the Stamper clan.

198
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,420
Ooh.

199
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,420
Yeah.

200
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,640
Next, Davron from Sweden who loves your podcast.

201
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Thank you so much.

202
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
You're now a policy wonk.

203
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
I'm a policy wonk.

204
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,840
Thank you very much, Davron from Sweden.

205
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,600
And then finally, thank you so much, Trump, the tiny hands of fate.

206
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,040
You are now a policy wonk.

207
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,320
I'm a policy wonk.

208
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,080
That's a little Mystery Science Theater reference.

209
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,160
Yes, yes, absolutely.

210
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,480
To go along with your-

211
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Trump, the hands of fate.

212
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,360
The tiny hands of fate.

213
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,400
That's to go along as another plug for your Twitch channel.

214
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,240
Great, great.

215
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,840
Where you have a Mystery Science Theater cut out.

216
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,240
I'm already embarrassed.

217
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,080
That's the goal.

218
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,080
Doing something is a terrible idea, Dan, that's the lesson.

219
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,920
That's the goal.

220
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm trying to smother you with embarrassment.

221
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,320
So Jordan, we started off today on the 27th.

222
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,960
Like I said, this is all going to be on the 27th.

223
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,800
Yes.

224
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,080
And Alex opens up the show and he teases

225
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,000
what will end up being the reason

226
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,160
we need to do this episode.

227
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,000
Gotcha.

228
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

229
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,800
thank you for joining us on this January 27th,

230
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,160
2021 Wednesday broadcast.

231
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,000
Blackjack.

232
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,920
I am your host, Alex Jones,

233
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,920
and we are going to have the founder of the Boogaloo Boys

234
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,920
joining us. Interesting.

235
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,800
Coming up on the broadcast today.

236
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,320
That is in the second hour.

237
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,920
I appreciate Mr. Dunn coming on after I've said

238
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,040
some critical things of his group.

239
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,400
He says to set the record straight.

240
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,960
So I look forward to that because who's going to know more

241
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,120
about the Boogaloo's than the founder of the Boogaloo's.

242
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,960
He is not the founder or the leader of the first thing that

243
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,880
Mike Dunn does when he gets on the show is correct Alex

244
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,720
about this.

245
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,960
Alex is trying to present him as like the head of these,

246
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,680
the Boogaloo's.

247
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,200
And I wrote down founder of the Boogaloo boys and then put

248
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,440
giant scare quotes around founder.

249
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,280
Yeah.

250
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,120
Yeah.

251
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,200
This is something that's a little bit murky.

252
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,440
I don't think this is a good idea for Alex.

253
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,400
You'll see why.

254
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,600
Cause he agrees with them on everything exactly like he did

255
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,440
with David Duke.

256
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,120
And this guy is a 20 year old who is really,

257
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,720
I would say he is more consistent than Alex.

258
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,560
Oh, that's not good.

259
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,200
And that makes it really tough to argue when you're Alex.

260
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,040
And that ends up becoming very embarrassing.

261
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,280
I would say that we have not talked as much about the

262
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,360
Boogaloo boys on this podcast because it doesn't intersect

263
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,800
with Alex as much as one might think.

264
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,960
Alex leaves them alone for the most part,

265
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,760
except a couple of times he's tried to use them to scapegoat

266
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,440
things that right wing militias have done.

267
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,280
And the situation with the Capitol on the 6th,

268
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,280
January 6th is so large and so important that it's led to a

269
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,680
critical mass of throwing them under the bus and blaming

270
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,520
them.

271
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,160
So his beloved oath keepers and such don't come under

272
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,000
attention.

273
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,840
Right.

274
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,680
Yeah.

275
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,920
He wouldn't do too much to, I guess,

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
point out the people who are basically he's running

277
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,600
stochastic terrorism for, you know, like he's,

278
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,440
he's the one who's both giving them that cover of like,

279
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,320
these guys aren't part of what we believe in while at the

280
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
same time, stoking their rage.

281
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,360
So you don't want to be also like Boogaloo boys,

282
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,760
let's pay attention to them.

283
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,520
Sure. It would be unwise.

284
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,560
And it's complicated for him too,

285
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,560
because there is a lack of uniformity with a lot of the

286
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,360
Boogaloo communities.

287
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,200
Right.

288
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,440
There is an embracing of Antifa sometimes even,

289
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,680
and black lives matter, or at least a loose accelerationism

290
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,440
being the goal, regardless of ideology behind it.

291
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,280
Yes. Perhaps some would say a potentially performative

292
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,080
collaboration and an acceptance of those left wing sort of

293
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,000
groups.

294
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,600
And that would be really difficult for Alex to explain to

295
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,440
his audience.

296
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,440
He's made such a sort of market off of globalist,

297
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,720
devil bad, Alex, Patriot, God, good.

298
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,560
Yeah. You know?

299
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,040
And I don't think that he'd be able to have his audience

300
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,200
understand the idea.

301
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,260
They're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

302
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,000
They're going there because they want to antagonize.

303
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

304
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,840
But also that they're trying to bring some people in there.

305
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,800
I know I've called them all demons,

306
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,920
but they're trying to bring in the accelerationists who I

307
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,760
guess are good now.

308
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,600
I don't know.

309
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
I don't know.

310
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,400
I've gotten some messages in the past from folks who,

311
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,080
or into boogaloo stuff.

312
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,800
And they implore me to understand that, you know,

313
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,400
it's about guns and gun rights.

314
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,240
Sure.

315
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,240
And the feeling that I have that I come around on it is I'm

316
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,360
not going to judge any individual based on their liking to

317
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,040
wear Hawaiian shirts and protest for the second amendment.

318
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,880
Sure.

319
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,760
But I'm also not going to trust them.

320
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,600
Yes.

321
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,120
If they associate themselves with a group like this.

322
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,280
And part of the reason for that is there have been enough

323
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,560
instances in the past of people who associate with boogaloo,

324
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,840
iconography, ideas, the movement,

325
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,840
doing things that are meant to accelerationist protests.

326
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,800
You know, make, who was that guy,

327
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,080
that sergeant who shot a cop and then wrote

328
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,800
a book and blood on his car.

329
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

330
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,200
He was talking prior to this about using left-wing protests,

331
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,640
using the energy of it in their anger for their purposes.

332
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,360
There's been enough instances of that.

333
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,960
There's been all that discussion.

334
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,480
And then let's just deal with the fact that boogaloo is a

335
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,960
reference to electric boogaloo break into,

336
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
which is like,

337
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,000
it was a meme back in 2012 about a second civil war.

338
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Right.

339
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,200
The whole organizing central thing is a joke,

340
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,080
quote unquote joke about,

341
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,080
all right, we're going to have to have a second civil war.

342
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,920
Right.

343
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,920
Boogaloo is from electric boogaloo,

344
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,400
civil war to electric boogaloo.

345
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,520
If you are someone who just cares about people's liberty and

346
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,600
rights and second amendment,

347
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
and you also like to be goofy and wear a Hawaiian shirt,

348
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
I would implore you to not be associated with the group

349
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,560
that's name is derived from a joke about how we need a

350
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
second civil war.

351
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,400
That would be wise.

352
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,960
And has spawned a bunch of incredibly malevolent actors.

353
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,000
There's nothing about this Hawaiian shirt that's intrinsic

354
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,320
to the thing that they seem to want to push for.

355
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,160
Yeah.

356
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,240
There's nothing, it just, I don't know.

357
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,120
It seems like a bridge too far.

358
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,000
I just can't imagine being in 2021 and taking anybody at

359
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,280
face value who says anything similar to that.

360
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,600
It's 2021 guys.

361
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,640
We don't take them at face value anymore.

362
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,160
Maybe you're a good person.

363
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,640
I know plenty of good people who are second amendment

364
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,320
people, tons of them.

365
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,040
But if I took any of them at face value,

366
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,600
I would be an insane person.

367
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,760
That's simply not a thing that we get to do anymore with

368
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
second amendment people.

369
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,760
I would bet that there are many individuals who consider

370
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,360
themselves part of the oath keepers that are decent,

371
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,360
family, caring, considerate people that aren't the type

372
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,760
that would have a napalm bomb.

373
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,920
Right. Right.

374
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,800
But. Napalm bombs, still rare.

375
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,960
True.

376
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,880
That said, even if that individual I could see as possibly

377
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,200
a decent person and I could probably get along with.

378
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,040
Sure.

379
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,880
I would not align myself with them politically.

380
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,720
Right.

381
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,480
Were I to know that they were associated

382
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,320
with the oath keepers.

383
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,160
Totally.

384
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,640
Because that's a deal breaker.

385
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,640
And I feel the same way largely about the Boogaloo stuff.

386
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,560
Yeah.

387
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,880
No, I just background check everybody I meet anymore now.

388
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,680
Just go back through their Twitter feed.

389
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,680
Just going back through the ah, ah, ah.

390
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,520
Nah, nah, nah.

391
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,280
You're not a face value second amendment guy.

392
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,760
Ah, I caught ya.

393
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,360
I don't believe anything.

394
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,840
So Alex does not want a violent revolution.

395
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,880
Sure.

396
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,480
But he is against the Boogaloo folks, which makes sense.

397
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,680
I mean, they kind of are gearing towards

398
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,080
like the inevitability of a second.

399
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,560
But it's kind of what Alex said.

400
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,280
He's, he's makes no sense.

401
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,120
Okay.

402
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,960
Those of you out there that are like,

403
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,680
oh, let's just have a violent revolution.

404
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,240
You're always the ones that are asking somebody else to do it.

405
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,720
You're always the ones asking somebody else to do it.

406
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
You know, take the Boogaloos.

407
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,240
They've said, and I'm gonna ask them about this,

408
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,040
that they want to have an armed march

409
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,480
the weekend after the sixth.

410
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,720
But if you have an armed march in DC,

411
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,760
they'll arrest you for that.

412
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,240
You can say, well, it's my second amendment.

413
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,480
They'll still arrest you.

414
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,200
And so then we didn't see the Boogaloos show up armed.

415
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,400
Were they hoping other people would?

416
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,120
I don't know.

417
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,960
I just don't like this thing

418
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,880
of let's have violent revolution.

419
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,960
And then people say, okay, well you go first.

420
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,760
Well, I'm not going first and.

421
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,520
There's so much in that clip there

422
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,400
that just contradicts Alex's entire branding.

423
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,240
Yeah.

424
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,440
He's saying that he isn't gonna go first,

425
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,400
but he also spent so much of his time on his show

426
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,000
yelling about how he's the tip of the spear.

427
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,840
The spear.

428
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,520
And Infowars is the thing that it's at the front.

429
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,960
It hits the barbed wire to make sure

430
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,680
it's safe for everyone else to charge.

431
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,520
Absolutely.

432
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,760
If you listened to Alex's show

433
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,160
and believed a word of what he said,

434
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,720
you might be surprised to hear him say

435
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,920
he doesn't want to be at the front.

436
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,280
Also, Alex's opposition to the Boogaloo idea

437
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,280
of having armed marches makes no sense.

438
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,120
None.

439
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,600
Alex is a gun rights absolutist.

440
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,000
And in the past, he's been pretty clear

441
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
that every American has the right to carry arms

442
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,680
peacefully and responsibly at protests.

443
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,520
The idea that a certain group is being told

444
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,320
that they'll be arrested if they march armed

445
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,200
should be a huge violation of his concept

446
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,120
of the Second Amendment,

447
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,200
and yet here he is saying that the Boogaloo type

448
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,920
shouldn't march armed because the state told them not to?

449
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,400
This is where it's important to recognize

450
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,520
that Alex has no real concrete principles

451
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,680
that he's working off of,

452
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,640
or else his position here would have to be different.

453
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,920
He doesn't have a principled belief

454
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,040
in the right to gun ownership.

455
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,520
He just likes shooting guns a lot,

456
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,400
and he found that it was a really marketable niche

457
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,080
to be a guy who yells vague threats

458
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,360
towards anyone who indicates support for gun regulation.

459
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,200
True.

460
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
At the moment, business requires that he actually

461
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,600
be in favor of people he would normally call gun grabbers,

462
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,400
and somehow this doesn't seem weird

463
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,160
to a large portion of his audience.

464
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Yeah, I mean, when your ideology is,

465
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,920
er, money, and your strategy is scramble

466
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,880
every time something weird happens,

467
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,080
then yeah, you're gonna get into

468
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,000
some real uncomfortable situations.

469
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,920
It does appear that way.

470
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,760
Yeah.

471
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,160
Someone else who's in an uncomfortable situation

472
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,400
is old Donald J. Trump.

473
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,240
Oh.

474
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,520
He's got his impeachment trial coming up.

475
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,360
Sure.

476
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,960
And Alex has a pretty good idea.

477
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,800
I believe.

478
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,640
Of what he needs to do.

479
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,480
Okay.

480
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,080
He's lost over 60 other platforms,

481
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,400
so he can be silenced, listen to this,

482
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,360
silenced ahead of and during his trial.

483
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,520
And it guarantees they're saying,

484
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,880
oh, let the president's lawyers put on the defense.

485
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,720
No.

486
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,120
Put Trump in there.

487
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,480
Put Trump in there on the witness seat

488
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,720
and let them attack him and lie about him,

489
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,000
and all he's gotta do is have a hit list of exhibits

490
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,440
after they attack him that he puts on,

491
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,000
and it will destroy them right out of a Perry Mason movie.

492
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,840
Yeah, that's right.

493
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,680
Get Trump up there.

494
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,560
Just putting the whole system on trial.

495
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,400
Yes, please.

496
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,440
Yes, please.

497
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,360
I would like that.

498
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,800
Please take that advice.

499
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,760
That is something that I would,

500
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,880
that would be the first time

501
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,760
that I have ever watched an entire speaking,

502
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,720
yeah, yeah, I would be riveted.

503
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,440
Yes, keep on going, man.

504
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,960
It's, I think it's sound advice to be like,

505
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,160
let your lawyers represent you in a trial.

506
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,800
A man who takes himself as a client has a fool for a lawyer.

507
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,640
Yeah.

508
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,160
So Alex is really getting into this idea

509
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,720
that Trump needs to get up there

510
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,400
and lambast the entire Congress.

511
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,840
Yeah, I think that'd work.

512
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,720
And then he pulls out a really weird quote.

513
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,400
Right out of the real footage

514
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,160
of the famous House Committee on Un-American Activities,

515
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,280
and then the Senate Committee on Un-American Activities,

516
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,520
and the lawyer says, have you no decency?

517
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,480
You know, just that point.

518
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,360
And I mean, I could go into that trial

519
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,320
and annihilate them, annihilate them.

520
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,640
This is their Waterloo.

521
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,720
But of course, they're always the aggressive globalist.

522
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,960
We always cower to them.

523
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,440
We always act like we're the bad guys

524
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,880
and we're on the defense.

525
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,720
So that'd be great.

526
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,120
The idea of Trump like having Alex

527
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,400
as his sort of representative in court.

528
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,880
I thought it was going to be the best it could be

529
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,440
with Trump representing himself.

530
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,480
But now the idea of Trump represented by Alex Jones

531
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,120
has one upped it again.

532
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,320
God damn.

533
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,800
It would be a zoo.

534
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,840
It would just, I don't even, I couldn't even imagine it.

535
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,680
I would love it.

536
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,520
It would be perfect.

537
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,720
Now that famous quote that have you no sense of decency,

538
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,160
that's an interesting thing for Alex to pull out.

539
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,200
That line was spoken by Joseph Welch,

540
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,720
a lawyer who's representing the army

541
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,760
in a case against Joseph McCarthy.

542
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,000
McCarthy had accused one of the young attorneys

543
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,520
working with Welch of being connected to the communists.

544
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,080
And that is what prompted Welch

545
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,040
to question McCarthy's decency.

546
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,920
The beginning of the quote is actually quote,

547
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,480
and tell this moment, Senator,

548
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,440
I think I never really gauged your cruelty

549
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,200
or your recklessness.

550
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,760
This hearing was being broadcast on television

551
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,720
and most essentially it destroyed Joseph McCarthy's career.

552
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,520
At least in part because it clearly exposed

553
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,960
how much of a witch hunt McCarthy was engaging in.

554
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,640
Alex loves Joseph McCarthy

555
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,600
and thinks that the House Un-American Activities Committee

556
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,920
was absolutely legitimate

557
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,200
and they were doing the essential work

558
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,960
of rooting out commies.

559
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,960
Alex shouldn't celebrate the line have you no decency.

560
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,040
I was really confused by that

561
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,360
because it was directed towards the guy.

562
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,920
That's what threw me for a loop.

563
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,760
No.

564
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,040
Okay, so he's saying he really could have taken it

565
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,760
to Joseph McCarthy if he had.

566
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,360
He's saying that he could be that lawyer

567
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,520
saying it to like Nancy Pelosi.

568
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,360
Right.

569
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,200
Or I guess Chuck Schumer

570
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,160
because it would be in the Senate.

571
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,800
He doesn't understand how things work.

572
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,640
Nope.

573
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,560
He's evoking something that should be like a deep wound

574
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,160
in his anti-communist psyche.

575
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you destroyed the guy

576
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,880
who I think or I think could have solved

577
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,120
all of our non-white problems, yeah.

578
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,680
So in this next clip,

579
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,720
we get one of the more unsettling ideas

580
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,480
that Alex has about the Boogaloo types.

581
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,160
And this is something that we've heard him express before

582
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,720
and it's a revelation that he kinda can tell

583
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,480
whether or not a group is real or not by who they target.

584
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,520
Okay, that's great.

585
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,520
They wanna accelerate us into a physical conflict

586
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,480
because they believe they can kill our free society

587
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,600
and submit their takeover that way.

588
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,440
That's why they're gonna lead paramilitary groups

589
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,280
that are either knowingly controlled or unknowingly controlled

590
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,480
because of their low IQs

591
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,560
into hitting targets that are not good targets.

592
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,480
I mean, let me tell you, I'm not saying kill anybody, okay?

593
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,360
But you know, the globalists coming at us

594
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,320
with these deadly vaccines

595
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,960
that they know are meant to be populated,

596
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,360
the super unpopular top globalists, Klaus Schwab,

597
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,480
Bill Gates, notice you never see anybody

598
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,480
actually going after the people above Biden, above Trump.

599
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,400
There's all the secret service from the president

600
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,800
to make you think they actually run things.

601
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,640
Seem disappointed that people aren't making runs

602
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,200
at Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab.

603
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,560
All right, I wrote this down as a quote.

604
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,400
I'm not saying kill anybody.

605
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,240
But you know.

606
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,080
But you know.

607
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,920
You know.

608
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,760
That's words that mean kill people.

609
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,880
You know.

610
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,600
No, that's me.

611
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,440
Yeah.

612
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,520
No, that's kill people.

613
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,880
Yeah, I think that the message is astoundingly clear.

614
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,480
Absolutely clear.

615
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,840
I'm not saying kill anybody, but that's what.

616
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,800
See now, if I'm not saying kill anybody,

617
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,360
I'm going to say, I'm not saying kill anybody, period.

618
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,200
Period.

619
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,240
Period in that sentence.

620
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,920
Not comma, because nothing that comes after that comma

621
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,440
is gonna be anything other than, but we should kill people.

622
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,800
You know, the next clause is generally gonna be like.

623
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,200
Negates the first clause.

624
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,440
Yeah, or at least delineates like circumstances

625
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,200
where the first clause doesn't apply.

626
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,240
By the rules of grammar,

627
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,240
Alex has called for violent revolution.

628
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,080
Does feel that way.

629
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,920
Yeah.

630
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,960
So, but the thing that he's calling for even more

631
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,440
is that Trump needs to turn this damn impeachment trial

632
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,280
into a circus.

633
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,120
I love it.

634
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,560
And we need to get that message to Trump

635
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,640
and we are getting that message to him

636
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,120
that he needs to go on the offense.

637
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,400
He needs to demand to face his accusers.

638
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,480
He needs to demand to be in that Senate trial.

639
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,080
He needs to make it three weeks long, a month long.

640
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,320
Suck all the oxygen out of Biden.

641
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,720
And I hate to even say all this on air,

642
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,360
but this is the advice I've actually gotten to the president.

643
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
I'll leave it at that.

644
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,360
He needs to just demand, because I mean, in a real trial,

645
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,880
he could have a two month trial.

646
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,600
And Trump just needs to dominate,

647
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,040
suck all the air out of Biden.

648
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,760
And he can literally turn this whole thing around

649
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,320
against him if he doesn't abide that he's been defeated.

650
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,480
I can tell you, he doesn't feel defeated,

651
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,200
but he just feels totally sick of it and pissed off

652
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,240
that this was allowed to happen.

653
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,320
And I'm telling you, Trump needs to go on the offense.

654
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,160
They're telling him behind the scenes just on record

655
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,400
that if he shuts up and goes along and rolls over,

656
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,480
they're gonna leave him alone.

657
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,320
No, they're not.

658
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,240
The only way they leave him alone

659
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,200
is when they're defeated.

660
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,680
This is like the same shit he was saying four years ago.

661
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,720
Yeah.

662
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,560
Yep.

663
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,760
They're saying like, oh, just leave this alone

664
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,000
and we'll leave you alone.

665
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,520
Like, no, these globalists, they're making these deals.

666
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,960
It's just, this is so boring.

667
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,480
Yeah.

668
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
He's talking about his own feelings.

669
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,760
I know, I'm disappointed to be in reruns

670
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,120
of reality right now.

671
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,560
This is really a bummer.

672
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,760
You can almost feel it, the way he's,

673
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,360
the manner of speech, he's just coming up with things

674
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,600
that he, Alex personally feels and applying them to Trump.

675
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,440
Yep, yep.

676
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,280
It's ridiculous.

677
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,240
I would like to yell at Nancy Pelosi.

678
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,720
So strangely enough, my advice to Trump is to yell at,

679
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,720
he should do what I wish I could do, is all he's saying.

680
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,560
Yeah.

681
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,240
So there's big Proud Boy news.

682
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,080
Sure.

683
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,120
Also, it should be pointed out

684
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,720
that Alex was jumped into the Proud Boys

685
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,640
by Gavin McGinnis on air on Infowars.

686
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,480
That's true.

687
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,680
So he is technically a Proud Boy.

688
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,520
That is true.

689
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,360
He aimed cereals.

690
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,320
That is true.

691
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,440
While Gavin was giving him little silly punches.

692
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,080
Yeah, I think that should be actionable.

693
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,680
Rufio Panman.

694
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,520
Yes.

695
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
Based stick man.

696
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,800
Right.

697
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,840
Gavin McGinnis, Alex Jones, Rambo Joe Biggs.

698
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,320
What a murderer's row of shit bags.

699
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,920
But there's news about one of the other members.

700
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,760
Okay.

701
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,480
All right, we've got some really big Proud Boy news

702
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,160
that's gonna be breaking next segment.

703
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,520
I wish I never had to hear that sentence.

704
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,480
I wanna cover this very important topic right now.

705
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,160
The Left is not created.

706
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,000
Okay.

707
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,840
What?

708
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,680
Big Proud Boy news.

709
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,320
The Left doesn't know how to make memes as well as I do.

710
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,120
Yeah, I'm the meme machine.

711
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,960
That's what they call me.

712
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,240
Yeah.

713
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,920
Yeah, all right, great.

714
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,520
So yeah, there was news that came out

715
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,680
that in the past, Enrique Tarrio.

716
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,080
Yeah, he was an informant, right?

717
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,920
Yes.

718
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,680
I've read these stories and I'm not sure

719
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,360
that I see concrete indications that he still is.

720
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,200
Right.

721
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,360
And I can see that going either way.

722
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,200
Right.

723
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,880
And so I am gonna withhold any kind of judgment

724
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,400
or any declaration on what his current behaviors are.

725
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,240
Right, right, right.

726
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,920
Because I'm not involved and I've never met the guy

727
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,080
and I don't give a shit.

728
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,720
Now, I would say if I were Alex, I might be worried.

729
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,000
Because Enrique Tarrio's been on Alex's show

730
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,400
a bunch of times.

731
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,160
He was really good friends with Joe Biggs

732
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,360
who just got arrested.

733
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,760
Well, there's that.

734
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,920
I would say that Alex might have,

735
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,400
or Joe Biggs might have, said some things

736
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,920
that you wouldn't want to say to an informant.

737
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,840
Well, I bet they probably didn't text it

738
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,160
to each other though, Dan.

739
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,760
I don't know if that's the case.

740
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,840
And like I said, I still need to see further indications

741
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,440
to feel at least, you know, like convinced

742
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,720
that he was like snitching on the Proud Boys or whatever.

743
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,800
See now, this is a problem for me.

744
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,360
It is kind of funny.

745
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,320
This is a problem for me.

746
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,000
This is what I'm talking about

747
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,880
with higher class of criminal, all right?

748
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,120
The Proud Boys are also really bad at being a gang.

749
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,400
Like in Chicago, if you get taken up by the cops

750
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,320
and you're in a gang, man, they just assume you talk.

751
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,440
It doesn't matter.

752
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,120
It doesn't matter if you talked or not.

753
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,280
You can't take that risk.

754
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,120
Sure.

755
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,960
So they can.

756
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,440
Of course you say Enrique Tarrio is an informant,

757
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
whether he is or not.

758
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,840
You gotta get him out of there.

759
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,680
I think if you're doing like security for the Proud Boys,

760
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,520
yes.

761
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,440
I understand making that like sort of safety decision.

762
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,280
Right.

763
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,120
I understand that.

764
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,200
This is a gang that punches you

765
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,400
and makes you name cereals to get in.

766
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,520
I understand that.

767
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,040
I understand that.

768
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,400
They should get into meth is what I'm trying to say.

769
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,240
Isn't that what I'm saying?

770
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,680
Maybe our expectations for how tight a ship they run

771
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,120
should be adjusted.

772
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,200
They're also-

773
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,600
They do not have a string or bell.

774
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,560
No. That is for sure.

775
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,400
No.

776
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,000
They laugh at Gavin McGinnis' jokes.

777
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,840
It's not a good group.

778
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,880
No, that's not good.

779
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,480
So Alex has some vaccine news.

780
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,920
Also, you have some vaccine news,

781
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,040
like you mentioned up top.

782
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,880
I have good news.

783
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,160
Yep, Alex has some other news.

784
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,000
Oh.

785
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,840
Hey, did you hear?

786
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,360
Merck has pulled its two vaccines

787
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,680
because of major health problems and bad reactions,

788
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,560
both their mRNA vaccine and their regular vaccine

789
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,920
that had a bizarre measles delivery system.

790
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,840
Those have been pulled and they say it doesn't work

791
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,440
and it's dangerous and you shouldn't take a vaccine

792
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,000
because they know the house of cards is coming down.

793
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,160
Alex isn't wrong about the underlying story here.

794
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,720
And that is that Merck did in fact abandon its attempts

795
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,040
to create two experimental coronavirus vaccines this week.

796
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,360
However, the message of this story

797
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,640
is completely misrepresented by Alex into being anti-vax.

798
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,080
In reality, a story like this

799
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,960
should give people even more confidence

800
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,640
about the vaccines that are widely available

801
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,120
because this clearly demonstrates

802
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,040
that there are some vaccines that don't make the cut.

803
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,960
These two that were developed by Merck

804
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,680
are not the same ones that were made by Pfizer or Moderna.

805
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,600
So pointing at this story

806
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,440
as a way to make those vaccines look bad makes no sense,

807
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,520
but that's exactly what Alex is doing.

808
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,120
Alex is also just lying when he says

809
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,160
that Merck decided to stop pursuing these vaccines

810
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,600
because of bad reactions.

811
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,320
From NPR, quote, Merck is halting development

812
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,280
of its two COVID-19 vaccine candidates

813
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,400
saying that while the drugs seem to be safe,

814
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,520
they didn't generate enough of an immune response

815
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,040
to effectively protect people against the coronavirus.

816
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
So they just didn't work.

817
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,800
Yeah, Merck spent a ton of money

818
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,440
on developing these potential vaccines

819
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,200
and ultimately it didn't work.

820
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,000
The fact that this happens pretty regularly

821
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,640
is actually an indictment of Alex's fictional worldview.

822
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,920
And it's really interesting

823
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,440
to see him reporting on a story

824
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,360
that's a huge problem for his narratives

825
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,040
as if it somehow validates them.

826
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,120
It's very weird.

827
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,360
Yeah, but the narrative for them is

828
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,480
if the system isn't working, the system isn't working.

829
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,680
And the system is, if it is working,

830
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,160
then the system isn't working

831
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,480
because if it's working, it's trying to kill you.

832
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,320
Maybe.

833
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,240
And that idea of like-

834
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,280
I think in this case,

835
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,680
it's more just like a sleight of hand thing

836
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,840
where it's like these vaccines got recalled.

837
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,800
Now, how can you trust this completely separate vaccine?

838
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,320
And then also just making shit up.

839
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,160
Yeah, I mean, the obvious thing for him,

840
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,360
the obvious problem there is that this in many ways

841
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,080
is essentially the free market

842
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,840
working the way it's supposed to.

843
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,720
They don't have a product they can sell

844
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,040
so they can't sell it.

845
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,880
Yeah.

846
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,720
It's very simple.

847
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,240
But Alex would believe that even if they did have a product

848
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,120
that was ineffective because everything is about money,

849
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,840
just 100%, they would still sell it

850
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,040
even though it wasn't effective

851
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,000
because they'd sunk so much money into it.

852
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,840
Of course.

853
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,960
He just doesn't, he has an incoherent worldview.

854
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,800
Doesn't care.

855
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,720
Anyway, Alex is gonna get to interviewing this Boogaloo

856
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,360
gentleman and it's interesting

857
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,160
because he can't quite figure out where to place himself

858
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,000
because he's like,

859
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,600
you do have a responsibility to overthrow a government.

860
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,040
Well, he already said earlier,

861
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,400
I'm not saying kill anybody, but you know.

862
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,320
And that theme may develop later.

863
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,160
I believe that.

864
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,160
This just is really, this makes no sense to me.

865
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,600
I believe the Declaration of Independence.

866
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,400
I believe that when we have a destructive government

867
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,160
that has come after our freedoms and our rights

868
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,480
and that has proven itself to be an authoritarian force

869
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,440
that isn't going away, it's not just our right,

870
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,180
it's our duty to throw off such a force.

871
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,760
But I don't wanna stupidly do it.

872
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,960
I don't wanna be led by the ADL,

873
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,880
the Southern Poverty Law Center.

874
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,840
I don't wanna be led by idiots.

875
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,720
I don't want to go with the wrong targets

876
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,640
and I wanna exhaust every form of unofficial warfare

877
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,520
because war is just politics by other means,

878
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,000
as Von Bismarck said.

879
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,200
The pen is my iron sword.

880
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,320
And so I'm not very good at war if I can't win with the pen.

881
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,760
And so I'm really trying to do that.

882
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,400
You're not gonna win with the pen or a sword.

883
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,560
But I just, I don't understand what he's saying

884
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,360
other than kill my enemies.

885
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,180
Yes.

886
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,760
Because he's saying that these,

887
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,880
like I don't wanna be led

888
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,960
by the Southern Poverty Law Center or the ADL.

889
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,800
That's meaningless.

890
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,520
That's just nonsense.

891
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,920
But the problem that he seems to have

892
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,600
is that these groups aren't doing what he wants.

893
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,440
Yes.

894
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,720
Yes, that's a real issue.

895
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,400
Because he says that you have a responsibility

896
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,760
to throw off this government

897
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,040
once it reaches X, Y, and Z point.

898
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,880
Right.

899
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,540
His show is essentially all about

900
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,720
how we've reached X, Y, and Z point.

901
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,320
99% of it, yes.

902
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,160
Yeah.

903
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,980
Also the left is uncreative.

904
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,880
That's true.

905
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,640
Those are basically the two themes.

906
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,600
Yeah, so he makes a career out of arguing

907
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,680
that we have reached the point

908
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,040
where it's essential to throw off the government

909
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
and then you have these people who are like,

910
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,120
well, eh?

911
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,600
Well, he made a career out of it.

912
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,060
If he hadn't made a career out of it,

913
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,200
he would be more interested in people actually doing it.

914
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,640
Yeah, probably.

915
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,920
Because there's not a money in that.

916
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,880
Exactly.

917
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,880
Yeah.

918
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,680
So now we get to the point where Mike Dunn,

919
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,600
Boogaloo Boy extraordinaire comes on for the interview.

920
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,480
And this note that I have right here on this clip is just,

921
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,840
this is a bad idea.

922
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,660
Oh.

923
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,320
Now, Mike Dunn, I appreciate him coming on.

924
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,160
Usually people we disagree with are cowards.

925
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,560
They don't come on.

926
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,000
So he gets landmarks coming on.

927
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,480
And Mike Dunn is a well-known Boogaloo Boy.

928
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,040
They call him the leader, the founder,

929
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,040
constitutional adherent, 20-year-old,

930
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,520
former Trump supporter, turned libertarian.

931
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,520
I guess he was in the Marines too as well.

932
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
And so I'm going to try to give him

933
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,640
the floor of the rest of this segment.

934
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,960
We've got about seven minutes left.

935
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,760
Then I've got my questions and my comments.

936
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,240
So he wants to set us straight.

937
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,400
We're all about folks that want to set us straight.

938
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,920
And if I'm wrong, I will apologize.

939
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,120
So Mike, thanks for coming on.

940
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,600
None of that is accurate.

941
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,100
Mm.

942
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,320
Yeah.

943
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:48,960
Yeah.

944
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,640
It's funny too, whenever Owen Schroyer, who's also there,

945
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,800
chiming in periodically, he is complaining

946
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,200
about these other people who are too cowardly to come on.

947
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,520
It's like, Brian Stelter, Rachel Maddow.

948
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,980
Yeah, they're not going to come on.

949
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,480
No.

950
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,020
No, no, they're not going to come on.

951
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,080
Also, maybe the reason that he's coming on

952
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,240
is because he's not your, he doesn't disagree with you.

953
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:10,740
Yeah.

954
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,920
I'm not saying that you guys are wrong.

955
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,280
Maybe he recognizes that you are very usable.

956
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,920
Yeah.

957
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,640
Yeah.

958
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,880
You are a platform that is exploitable for his purposes.

959
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,000
Which he could have learned is a lot easier

960
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,200
than he might think if he had listened to our show.

961
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:28,680
Sure.

962
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,080
I mean, Steve Pajanik laid it out.

963
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,680
Exactly.

964
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,680
That's all you got to do.

965
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,960
Alex, you are fucking so easy.

966
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,680
So easy.

967
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,240
Yeah.

968
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,320
So Mike starts off, like I said, the first thing he does

969
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,400
is correct Alex about the leadership.

970
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,200
Right.

971
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,400
First things first, I'm not the leader of the Boogaloo.

972
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,240
I'm not the founder.

973
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,640
It's an autonomous movement.

974
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,440
I'm just someone who's in the movement who

975
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,800
helped make it big in the media limelight and public face.

976
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,560
And I happen to control a large portion of the movement.

977
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,060
So I just wanted to get that straight.

978
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,520
The movement was not founded by me,

979
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,920
and I'm not the leader of it.

980
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,760
Simply a prominent figure in it.

981
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,680
I control a large portion of it is an interesting.

982
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,160
That's a strange.

983
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,760
Yeah.

984
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,600
I control a large, how large a portion?

985
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,160
I don't know.

986
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,880
But he is a guy who there was a Vice article and video

987
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,560
about him done, I believe, last year.

988
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,960
And it sort of traces some of his roots

989
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,240
from being a Virginia gun rights militia type, which

990
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,960
if you recall a year ago, Alex was super into.

991
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,920
Loved it.

992
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,400
And then through that, he fell in with Boogaloo communities

993
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,160
and what have you.

994
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,600
I assume the article started with Mike Dunn dot dot dot

995
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,960
or Mike Fun question mark.

996
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,320
And then just a Hawaiian shirt emoji.

997
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,440
Yeah.

998
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,480
Yeah, so he was involved prior to getting

999
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,680
into the Boogaloo stuff in just a lot of stuff

1000
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,360
that Alex is super, super into and capitalized

1001
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,920
on the gun rights rally in Virginia

1002
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,120
that Alex talks about all the time.

1003
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,080
Some of the malicious stuff that Mike was involved in

1004
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,360
was involved in that.

1005
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,520
No, it's almost like a lot of these far right guys

1006
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,600
are almost giving these exit interviews with these people

1007
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,200
like, hey, you did a great job, but we got to cut you loose.

1008
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,560
And by cut you loose, I mean blame you for everything

1009
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,640
that we've done.

1010
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,760
And the flip side of it is kind of a don't meet your heroes.

1011
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,640
Yeah.

1012
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,000
Kind of lesson for all these people who

1013
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,720
are coming on to Alex's show.

1014
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,680
Wait a second, I thought you liked us.

1015
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,240
I thought you were great, Alex, but unfortunately, oh

1016
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,960
boy, Mike.

1017
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,040
Mike is, I think that he can tell that Alex

1018
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,240
is trying to set him up.

1019
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,040
Yeah.

1020
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
Because Alex is trying to be a dick to him.

1021
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,720
And I think that Mike knows that,

1022
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,360
and he's a millennial Gen Z kind of guy.

1023
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,280
Gen Z, I guess.

1024
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,520
But, or Zoom?

1025
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,320
What's it called?

1026
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,080
Don't even worry about it.

1027
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,160
I don't know the name of Generations.

1028
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,400
Don't worry about it.

1029
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,160
But he's a youth, and he's equipped

1030
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,520
to handle Alex's bullshit.

1031
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,400
Trouble.

1032
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,440
To start with, Alex, you started with a quote.

1033
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,120
I want to address that as well, from yourself.

1034
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,200
Here's some other quotes from you.

1035
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,360
1776 is the answer to 1984.

1036
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,320
You also said if just 5% of people

1037
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,960
got motivated in some direction, and it doesn't

1038
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,000
have to be what I believe in, but if they got motivated

1039
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,760
and stopped getting their political ideologies

1040
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,920
from the media, they would go and figure out what they want.

1041
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,280
And we're literally doing that.

1042
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,440
We have been motivated.

1043
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,400
We figured out what we wanted, which is freedom from tyranny.

1044
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,920
And we're willing to stand against that.

1045
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,560
When you say 1776 is the answer to 1984 and your involvement

1046
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,400
in the Capitol incidents, I know you can put up

1047
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,960
an article from the Gateway Pundit

1048
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,280
accusing me of inciting the violence and blah, blah, blah.

1049
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,560
Feeding into the media narrative like you

1050
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,440
don't want others to do.

1051
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,240
Hold on a second.

1052
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,480
I don't mean to interrupt you.

1053
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,880
I don't see what they're putting up.

1054
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,120
Let's not put the articles up right now.

1055
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,640
I'll get to my questions coming up.

1056
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,520
I want him to have the floor uninterrupted.

1057
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,360
Please continue.

1058
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,560
Alex is giving him a lot of space, and I think it's very

1059
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,040
weird.

1060
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,880
Oh, you weren't supposed to listen to me when I talked.

1061
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,160
You're definitely not supposed to come back at me with things

1062
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,840
that I've said before.

1063
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,560
You're definitely not supposed to use my words and ideas

1064
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,800
to justify your beliefs and your actions

1065
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,240
that I'm supposed to be condemning.

1066
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,440
Yeah, because they are my words, and boy, they sound

1067
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,000
exactly like what you're doing.

1068
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,520
Oh, boy.

1069
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,920
I'm in trouble now.

1070
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,680
Whoops.

1071
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,160
I imagine that's his thought process is just like, oh, no,

1072
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,080
he used words.

1073
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,600
Yeah.

1074
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,240
Oh, shit.

1075
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,800
Again, I wouldn't have done this interview if I were Alex.

1076
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,840
I think this is a bad idea.

1077
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,840
I think that he thinks that he can do these gotcha moments,

1078
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,000
like the Bill Ayers interview or David Rothschild.

1079
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,200
And it just, he's so bad at this.

1080
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,720
He's really good at steamrolling con men.

1081
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,320
He's not good at talking to people

1082
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,200
who have actual beliefs.

1083
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,040
Yeah, it's trouble.

1084
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,320
I don't agree with Mike, and I don't trust him.

1085
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,560
I don't think he's being necessarily above board

1086
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,040
and fully honest, even in this interview,

1087
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,680
that I do believe that he has beliefs more

1088
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,560
than Alex, and that's a problem.

1089
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
Alex can't handle it.

1090
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,360
And beliefs that are almost certainly inspired by Alex.

1091
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,360
Yes, and he is aware enough to recognize that Alex doesn't

1092
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,200
actually have those beliefs, and that's not good.

1093
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,880
Uh-oh.

1094
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,720
But 1776 is the answer to 1984.

1095
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,600
I want to paint you a picture from 1776.

1096
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,080
January 18th, Major Habersheen arrests a royal governor,

1097
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,000
James Wright.

1098
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,120
March 2nd, Americans begin shelling Boston, March 4th.

1099
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,880
We captured Dorchester Heights after a bloody battle.

1100
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,040
April 7th, we had a bloody major sea battle.

1101
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,160
August 27th, we had the Battle of Long Island.

1102
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,080
September 15th, we had another bloody battle.

1103
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,440
September 21st, New York City, a quarter of it was burned.

1104
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,240
October 11th, we had another bloody battle.

1105
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,000
That's just one of the many instances of 1776.

1106
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,240
So when you call for 1776, I almost

1107
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,080
feel like you're doing it just for the merch and not

1108
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,160
for the actual fact.

1109
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,360
We understand that our laws, our avenues

1110
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,200
that we should go through, have been clogged up

1111
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,880
by old men in politics.

1112
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,600
Politicians who were there for the money,

1113
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,680
they've been clogged up.

1114
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,080
They blocked us from actually having access to our rights.

1115
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,400
They've infringed upon constitutional rights,

1116
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,320
whether it be the First Amendment, the Second

1117
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,400
Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, it doesn't matter.

1118
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,640
They've infringed on those rights,

1119
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,720
and we realize that those avenues are no longer open to

1120
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,200
us.

1121
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,000
And so the only answer to that is

1122
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,120
to try to win the hearts and the minds of the people.

1123
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,280
And ultimately, there is going to be a revolution.

1124
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,600
Even you know this, and I know this.

1125
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,400
Even you.

1126
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,840
This is fucked for Alex.

1127
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,320
Wow.

1128
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,920
This is not good.

1129
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,440
No.

1130
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,080
This is a terrible situation for him

1131
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,960
to be in because he's being rightly

1132
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,000
confronted about his using Americana for merch and shit.

1133
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,600
That is a valid criticism for it to be levied against Alex.

1134
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,400
But he's also being scolded by somebody

1135
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,360
who stands to deeper radicalize, perhaps, his audience.

1136
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,640
Yeah, I'm interested in that push and pull

1137
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,400
because it does seem like there are twisted motivations here

1138
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,040
for Alex.

1139
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,920
Like one, of course, he has to be top dog.

1140
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,040
But two, he does want to give these exact ideas a platform.

1141
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,480
True.

1142
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,080
So that, to me, is part of why he's not interrupting so much.

1143
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,680
Yeah.

1144
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,480
It's hard for me to tell if it's like a way of painting

1145
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,760
this person as the fall guy, but also at the same time.

1146
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,560
Spreading his message.

1147
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,960
There is a part of me that feels like maybe that's

1148
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,640
what's going on.

1149
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,600
But I've seen enough interviews on Alex's show

1150
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,080
that are just like, he does not prepare at all.

1151
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,400
That he probably thought this was going to be a 20-year-old

1152
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,760
idiot who didn't know anything, who

1153
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,840
didn't have an awareness of Alex's career,

1154
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,160
didn't have an ability to stand up for himself.

1155
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,600
I would bet that he's just like, I'm going to talk to a tween?

1156
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,360
All right.

1157
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,560
I'm a man.

1158
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,560
Yeah, it is fascinating.

1159
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,600
I've been on there 27 years, man.

1160
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:02,160
It's really funny how completely clueless old people are,

1161
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,600
considering the fact that I believe

1162
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,080
that 90% of 16-year-olds are savvier and probably have

1163
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,840
a better education than I do.

1164
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,840
If you're under 23, I'm terrified, isn't it?

1165
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1166
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,320
You have powers.

1167
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,640
You guys don't even know what kind of fucking powers

1168
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,800
you have yet.

1169
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,120
And you're not going to lose an argument to Alex fucking Jones.

1170
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,480
No, that's pretty clear.

1171
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,640
I think there are probably some 20-year-olds who would,

1172
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,280
but this guy is not what Alex expected, I don't believe.

1173
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,600
Now, the thing that I take issue with,

1174
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,840
or the thing that I'm worried about, is that this is a guy

1175
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:43,800
who stands to be a negative influence on Alex's audience,

1176
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,280
insomuch as there are people who are like Gavin McInnes,

1177
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,840
or Nick Fuentes, or E. Michael Jones, who

1178
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,760
come on Alex's show and stand to take audiences

1179
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,320
on a different path.

1180
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,200
Take them from this, I mean, it's bad,

1181
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,440
but there's kind of an exploitative, vampiric nature

1182
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,920
to Alex's just keeping people scared

1183
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,240
and then selling them dumb pills they don't need.

1184
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:09,960
Like, I hate it.

1185
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,760
It's an awful thing, but it's kind of,

1186
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,200
Alex has a vested interest in them not going too far.

1187
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,640
He's doing it for the merch.

1188
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,600
Yes.

1189
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:23,360
And falling into overtly anti-Semitic communities,

1190
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,440
starting to watch the American Journal.

1191
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,080
These kinds of things are dangerous,

1192
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,760
and I don't think that he is the right person, this Mike,

1193
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,400
to be making these critiques of Alex that

1194
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,080
are justified and fair.

1195
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,000
And one of the reasons is, I mean,

1196
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,640
Mike believes a lot of the same stuff

1197
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,600
that Alex does, like that the election was a fraudulent one.

1198
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,800
We all saw widespread voter fraud.

1199
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,200
We all understand what happened in the election.

1200
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,120
We're not Trump fans.

1201
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,080
We're not Biden fans.

1202
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,880
We understand that.

1203
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,640
But a lot of you hold on to the hope of voting your way out

1204
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,160
of voter fraud, which is an impossibility.

1205
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,440
We see it as there has to be a revolution.

1206
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,200
There has to be a result. And it's going to come to that.

1207
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,960
We preach unity, bottom scale unity,

1208
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,840
against the elitist, the globalist, the people

1209
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,480
who control our country, the people who

1210
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,640
control our presidents, which you talked about previously.

1211
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,840
We see that as a way to say, hey, we're a dumb attorney,

1212
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,360
and we're going to stand against it.

1213
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,640
We're part of those 3% that have stood up, or in your case,

1214
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,000
from your quote, it's just 5% of people.

1215
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,760
We're part of that.

1216
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,160
We're the ones who have stood up.

1217
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,560
And that's pretty much all I had to say concerning the boogaloo

1218
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,480
and what we're about.

1219
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,680
We're about freedom and liberty for all people,

1220
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,520
non-discrimination, and the Constitution

1221
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,280
being applicable to those who disagree with you.

1222
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:41,360
So this is a chance to launder and sell this group as,

1223
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,640
but I honestly don't even understand

1224
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,720
why he would say that as if it's a good thing on Info Wars.

1225
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,800
Like, we don't discriminate.

1226
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,960
This whole thing is about discriminating, man.

1227
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,800
Yeah, all I hear is, we're looking for the right boot

1228
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,720
to lick.

1229
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,520
We ran out of boots.

1230
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,560
Now we are hoping somebody will come up

1231
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,320
who will help us oppress the people we want to oppress.

1232
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,000
I don't know if I would agree that that's

1233
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,280
the vibe I get off Mike.

1234
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:08,760
Sure.

1235
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,960
Alex, perhaps.

1236
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,840
No, I don't get that.

1237
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:17,000
Well, I mean, I guess it's that kind of always getting

1238
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,120
to that conversation of like, you guys just

1239
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,160
don't realize because you think you're

1240
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,920
going to be the mine owner.

1241
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,280
You don't think that you're going

1242
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,960
to be under a different boot.

1243
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,480
You think it's going to be some sort of utopia

1244
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,400
where you get to do whatever you want to do,

1245
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,080
and all you're doing is establishing someone else

1246
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,680
to fuck you over, probably worse.

1247
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:44,120
Yeah, and it's also, there were logistical reasons

1248
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:48,160
in a disconnected world why the Civil War in the United

1249
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,880
States in the 1860s didn't really

1250
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,560
lead to the complete destruction of America.

1251
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1252
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,440
We're another Civil War to break out today.

1253
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,280
It's not like what this fantasy is, where it's like,

1254
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,920
one side will fight the other, and then someone will win,

1255
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,680
and then America.

1256
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,120
There are no battlefields anymore in the States.

1257
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,400
No, but were there to be an actual Civil War,

1258
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,200
do you think that that would work

1259
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,080
for the other global powers that are tied up in our economy?

1260
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:18,880
Well.

1261
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,680
It wouldn't work.

1262
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,360
I imagine that China and Europe now,

1263
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,240
naturally they do have a massive investment in the United States

1264
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,520
continuing to function the same way.

1265
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,400
I imagine they would stand on the sidelines

1266
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,960
if all of the sudden the global economy were to crash.

1267
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,760
Let's see who wins.

1268
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:39,280
Because two groups of morons were dressed in red and blue

1269
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,320
on fucking a plane running at each other with knives.

1270
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,000
Oh, no.

1271
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,320
We need the economy and the entire world

1272
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,320
to get back online.

1273
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,280
We better pull for the boogaloos.

1274
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,000
Yeah, no chance.

1275
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,160
There's far ranging consequences from this sort

1276
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,240
of fantastical idea that they have.

1277
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,920
It was one of the reasons why I have

1278
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,680
a real lack of interest in accelerationist ideas

1279
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,360
is like, anyway, I really don't care.

1280
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,880
I don't care for this guy's kind of ideology.

1281
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,640
And I also don't take him at face value

1282
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,920
about the non-discrimination.

1283
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,480
Maybe him personally, I don't know.

1284
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,800
I don't know anything about him as an individual

1285
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,960
except for what he's put out on Vice and shit.

1286
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,120
But I don't know.

1287
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,120
Yeah, I find it hard to believe how many people still believe

1288
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,960
that a civil war in the United States

1289
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:41,880
would have two armies opposed to each other with two generals

1290
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,880
all choosing which troops to put where,

1291
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,040
as opposed to either being like, there's

1292
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,680
no middle ground in a war in the United States.

1293
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,680
It's either street battles in every United States city

1294
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,400
or explosions everywhere.

1295
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,000
There's no just, we're going to go fight.

1296
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,800
And you know the quickest way to get the UN here too

1297
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,120
is probably that.

1298
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,400
Yes.

1299
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,920
Get the UN involved.

1300
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,520
Oh, man.

1301
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,760
I'm sure Alex would love that.

1302
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,680
Yeah, it'd be great.

1303
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:18,680
So Mike and Alex get to talking about how Alex's ideas are

1304
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,880
kind of behind what Mike is doing.

1305
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,680
And Alex has a really tough time with this.

1306
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,720
I'm just trying to figure out, are these,

1307
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,440
because you mentioned this.

1308
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,480
And you respond to the 1776 thing

1309
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,720
because I'm somebody that's very clear that I believe

1310
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,160
in civil disobedience.

1311
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,720
I believe in defensive defense and violence.

1312
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,240
I really want to fix this peacefully.

1313
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,760
In fact, let's just go there first.

1314
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,480
You're saying listening to my work, my energy,

1315
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,800
you're taking from that the idea of revolution or armed

1316
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,640
conflict?

1317
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,400
Yeah, no shit.

1318
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,160
I definitely wouldn't say that I took it directly from you.

1319
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,720
I'm just saying that the idea that you portray

1320
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,200
and the message that you carry sometimes

1321
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,600
tend to look like you're just there to create merch

1322
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:07,080
and not actually stand for an actual revolution.

1323
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,760
You talk about peaceful protesting.

1324
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,680
And I always thought, the Alex Jones I listened to growing up

1325
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,560
was someone who wanted the government to fear the people.

1326
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:19,160
And so I'm not saying that you incited it or you directed it.

1327
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,160
But I am saying that if you continue to preach a 1776

1328
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,920
revolution or the type of message that you preach,

1329
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,960
you're going to have to figure out whether you're just

1330
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,480
going to bend the knee and continue

1331
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,160
to make your talk show or if you're actually

1332
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,680
going to stand against the tyranny that is present in the US.

1333
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,560
Well, Mike, let's be 100% clear.

1334
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,240
You better believe I sell t-shirts and I sell product.

1335
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,400
That gets the word out, that's dedication.

1336
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,480
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1337
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,760
They want to shut us down.

1338
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,960
They want to kill our speech.

1339
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,520
They want us to exercise our speech online.

1340
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,000
You guys wear your shirts that are Hawaiian shirts,

1341
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
to see them being owned.

1342
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,160
We're info wars.

1343
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,080
And damn right, I've got the globalists

1344
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,200
trying to shut me down.

1345
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,680
I am a capitalist.

1346
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,400
I didn't get $10.6 billion from Democrat donors

1347
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,160
and George Soros like Black Lives Matter.

1348
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,520
So I don't get any funding like Antifa or a BLM.

1349
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,600
I don't have people volunteering to do my security.

1350
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,560
I pay my security.

1351
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,000
I don't have the Boogaloo boys volunteering for my security.

1352
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,240
I pay for my security.

1353
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,920
So I mean, I'm a capitalist.

1354
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,840
I am not ashamed of selling products.

1355
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,800
But to be clear, if we get to a point

1356
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,120
where I think I've got to be violent,

1357
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,400
then I'll do what I have to do.

1358
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,200
That's why I'm fighting so hard.

1359
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,040
That's why I'm fighting so hard.

1360
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,840
Because I'm not going to stand around in capitals with guns

1361
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,520
if I get violent.

1362
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,920
Yeah, if Alex gets violent, he's going to have suction cups

1363
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,560
on his hands, skiggling up the side of a building.

1364
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,360
Alex Jones is going to be a commando,

1365
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,240
breaking into Soros's house with piano wire.

1366
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,320
Now, we all know Alex is a paratrooper.

1367
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,800
He's going to get in that parachute,

1368
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,120
and he's going to land directly on top of the catapult

1369
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,600
building, repel his way down.

1370
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,040
I know one thing about Alex Jones,

1371
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,320
and that is he is a man who is not unfamiliar with stealth.

1372
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,560
Yeah.

1373
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:06,720
Hey, hey, hey, where's my enemies?

1374
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,640
I'm a little drunk.

1375
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,920
Yeah, that's a little silly.

1376
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,400
I do think that Mike has a decent point,

1377
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,360
though, that Alex, the way he engages with his rhetoric

1378
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,160
and the way he behaves on air, does lead to a point

1379
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,960
where he has to be honest with himself.

1380
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,120
Am I just being a talk show host,

1381
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,880
or am I actually trying to rile people up to 1776?

1382
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,120
And we've heard Alex, when shit gets too hot, he's like,

1383
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,400
I'm just a talk show host, man.

1384
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:31,920
Right.

1385
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,800
You know, Shadow Gate comes out, he's like,

1386
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,080
I don't do any of this shit.

1387
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,560
Yeah, when the country is stable,

1388
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,240
or at least more stable than it is now,

1389
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,800
you can get away with the answer to 1984 is 1776.

1390
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,440
Everybody gets that it's a metaphor.

1391
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,880
Now, it's not a metaphor.

1392
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,480
It's not.

1393
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,160
You can't say it without meaning it, because it's happening.

1394
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,720
Yeah, and your use of it as a metaphor

1395
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,640
is part of what normalizes the state that we're in now,

1396
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,840
in the same way that Mimi jokes about civil war

1397
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,720
to electric boogaloo leads to people actually wanting

1398
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,160
to engage in ways that could set off a second civil war.

1399
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,480
Like, jokes can lead to action.

1400
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,600
And hey, maybe jokes were fine then, but not now.

1401
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,120
We can't do this like, no, no, no, what I really meant was,

1402
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,080
no, be specific, be careful in your language,

1403
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,760
and make sure that everybody is fucking trying, at least.

1404
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,800
It would be helpful.

1405
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,840
And instead, it's just like, oh, no, no, I didn't mean that.

1406
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,520
Well, guess what?

1407
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:41,120
Hundreds of thousands of people are ready for 1776,

1408
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,120
maybe millions.

1409
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,800
And they're surprised that you're not.

1410
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,480
Exactly.

1411
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:44,760
Yeah.

1412
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,320
Yeah, yeah.

1413
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,200
So now, this is the point in the interview

1414
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,720
where I think Alex realizes, uh-oh, I

1415
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,480
better be mean to this guy.

1416
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,600
I've got to condescend to him.

1417
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,000
How do you see this thing unfold?

1418
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,040
And tell me, General George Washington 2.0,

1419
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,720
how we're going to do this revolution.

1420
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,280
I don't know.

1421
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,880
I thought you were the General George Washington 2.0.

1422
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,480
And, of course.

1423
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,840
No, no, no, I'm not the guy out there

1424
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,520
saying we're going to have a revolution.

1425
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,520
So tell me.

1426
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,720
We need a declaration of independence by the states.

1427
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,280
We need a coalition of leaders ready

1428
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,280
with a bill of particulars of what we want.

1429
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,760
And then we go to war.

1430
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,000
Not a bunch of people taking selfies in the Capitol.

1431
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,160
That's the opposite of what we need.

1432
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,080
We need George Washington.

1433
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,160
He hadn't shown up yet.

1434
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,480
So I'm telling you, tell me what we do, General Dunn.

1435
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,960
What do we do right now?

1436
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,800
Go for it.

1437
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,880
Get those papers in order.

1438
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,120
Get the plan of government for after in order.

1439
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,120
And actually get it done and start building forces

1440
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,680
like you're supposed to, like all of us had done.

1441
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,560
I think that Alex thought he'd be cowed by that yelling.

1442
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,800
I think that he thought he'd be intimidated by Alex

1443
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,800
doing a little outburst.

1444
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,680
See, look at how stupid this is.

1445
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,200
You don't have a plan in place.

1446
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,760
OK, well, let's get a plan in place

1447
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,320
and take over the government.

1448
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,680
Oh, no.

1449
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,640
Oh, I thought you were just going to be stupid.

1450
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,720
Mike is saying, essentially, my part in this

1451
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,800
is rising up people.

1452
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,680
And that is what I have been doing.

1453
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,560
Great.

1454
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,600
We need those bills of particulars.

1455
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,040
Why the fuck isn't anyone doing it?

1456
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,040
Why are you doing it?

1457
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,520
Yeah.

1458
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,760
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1459
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,320
Yeah.

1460
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,840
No, he was like, I guess.

1461
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,120
Alex is in a bad place.

1462
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:17,440
I guess Alex was expecting him to reveal himself as stupid

1463
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,880
and reveal that, look at all your stupid ideas that

1464
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,240
don't make any sense.

1465
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,280
And then when he didn't reveal himself as stupid,

1466
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,520
he has to try and portray him as stupid.

1467
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,920
And now he realizes that it's impenetrable.

1468
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,000
You know, like, this is a generation

1469
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,320
that's been raised on my generation's irony.

1470
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,560
They're indestructible.

1471
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,960
Well, it's impenetrable for Alex also,

1472
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,800
because the only way to penetrate it

1473
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:48,440
is to sort of also puncture your own mythology

1474
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,360
and your own worldview.

1475
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,280
Were you to say, like, well, all this stuff that we complain

1476
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,680
about is bullshit.

1477
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,160
So the reason that you want the bill of particulars

1478
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,240
and a new government and all this is nonsense.

1479
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,040
It's all lies that we've been spouting for years on the radio.

1480
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,520
Now, you could do that, and then it

1481
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,040
would devolve into a completely different conversation.

1482
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,200
But Alex can't do that.

1483
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,880
Mike is essentially bulletproof on a lot of points,

1484
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,800
because he's talking to Alex, who he clearly

1485
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,400
knows profits from putting on a certain presentation.

1486
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,760
And he would stand to lose those profits

1487
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,640
if he were to do the thing that would

1488
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,120
deflate this conversation.

1489
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,560
Yeah, I don't know why people who

1490
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,840
are going to absolutely beat the shit out of Alex

1491
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,680
in an interview do not bring a hype man.

1492
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,720
So many different lines in there,

1493
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,720
he said, where somebody should be on the call

1494
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,440
to just be like, what?

1495
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,600
I cannot believe you just did that.

1496
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,880
Yeah.

1497
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,520
And this would be a good place for it,

1498
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,840
actually, because in this next clip,

1499
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,640
Mike kind of chews Alex out a little bit.

1500
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,480
We go to our capitals on where they say,

1501
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,200
you know, in Richmond, Virginia, Owen Troyer drove there.

1502
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,640
He saw some of my guys there on.

1503
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,480
They said, hey, you can't open carry here anymore.

1504
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,520
It's illegal now.

1505
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,760
We went and we disobeyed it.

1506
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,040
If they had tried to arrest us, we

1507
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,280
would have used the Second Amendment the way

1508
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,600
that it was intended, which is to limit government.

1509
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:06,800
Hold on.

1510
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,440
Say that again.

1511
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,640
Where did you do this?

1512
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,080
Because this is you putting your money where your mouth is.

1513
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:10,560
Where did you do this?

1514
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,480
Caravan.

1515
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,720
This is in Richmond, Virginia.

1516
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,720
It's illegal to open carry any protest or event armed.

1517
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,080
So we go there for Owen Troyer's thing

1518
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,920
when he came through with the Stop the Steal.

1519
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,240
We've been at every protest, whether it

1520
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,120
be MAGA, Black Lives Matter, anything,

1521
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,160
to make sure that things are peaceful and respectful.

1522
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,200
And we go there armed.

1523
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,400
We disobeyed the law.

1524
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,960
We stand against the tyranny.

1525
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,320
And what we see, people like you, Alex,

1526
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,560
who used to be my hero as a young man,

1527
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,640
we see young men in the need to it repeatedly.

1528
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,960
You have your talk shows.

1529
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,640
You give your speeches.

1530
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,120
But y'all don't actually stand against tyranny.

1531
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,600
And that's disheartening as a young man, a young American,

1532
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,880
and someone involved in the liberty movement

1533
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,280
and constitutionalism.

1534
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,520
Personally, I'm not speaking for the young man.

1535
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,320
Wait a minute.

1536
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,920
How am I not standing against tyranny,

1537
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,120
fighting evil legislation, marching, going out

1538
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,160
and having events?

1539
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,200
Sorry?

1540
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,360
Because you talk.

1541
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,080
We go out there.

1542
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,160
We actually disobey.

1543
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,360
We stand there armed.

1544
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,200
We're not willing to.

1545
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,480
We don't boot lick like a lot of you and Republicans do.

1546
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,320
We actually stand up against the tyranny that is prevalent.

1547
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,480
That's what I want to see y'all do.

1548
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,800
When you ask, well, what's the revolution look like?

1549
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,600
Well, there you go.

1550
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,400
It's us engaging in civil disobedience.

1551
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,520
And if they decide to do something,

1552
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,720
then we'll stand against that.

1553
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,040
You're not going out there where they say, hey,

1554
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,200
you can't open carry here.

1555
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,760
You can't exercise a constitutional right.

1556
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,280
You're not going out there and disobey it.

1557
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,520
Y'all want to do everything by the law

1558
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,240
because you're the party of law and order.

1559
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,960
Well, no, I have supported open carry.

1560
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,160
And I've supported the lawsuits and all the rest of it.

1561
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,440
So that's not a fair statement.

1562
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,840
Oh, you lost.

1563
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,600
Listen to the sound of his voice.

1564
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,000
Listen to the defeat.

1565
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,560
That was so weak.

1566
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,520
Alex cannot rebut.

1567
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,280
I went outside one time.

1568
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,080
You can honestly imagine somebody

1569
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,080
who likes Alex hearing this and it

1570
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,960
shattering some of the illusion that you have about Alex

1571
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,520
as him being a competent, confident, strong force.

1572
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:00,440
This guy is mirroring back a lot of Alex's rhetoric.

1573
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,400
He's pointing out the places where

1574
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,200
it's clear that Alex is in contradiction with himself.

1575
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,520
And it's, uh.

1576
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,760
And he's hammering the fact that he's in it for the merch.

1577
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,520
You talk.

1578
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,240
You talk.

1579
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,520
You talk for money.

1580
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,480
That's what you do.

1581
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,120
Yeah, you talk.

1582
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,200
We act.

1583
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:22,320
And that's why, you know, if there is tyranny, then.

1584
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,680
I'm halfway waiting for this to end like a Molyneux declaring

1585
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,440
himself a white nationalist where Alex is just like, well,

1586
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,320
I guess I'm a boogaloo boy, too.

1587
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,240
I didn't know it, but here we are.

1588
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,120
We'll see how it ends.

1589
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:33,640
Oh, god.

1590
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:37,160
So Alex, like you said, I mean, you could tell there was

1591
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:40,440
a little bit of submission there around showed ass.

1592
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:44,400
That like, oh, no, I've supported open carry.

1593
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,280
And so Alex has to retreat to trying to have gotcha moments.

1594
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,800
So he brings up the Capitol.

1595
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,400
The strategic blunder of rushing into the Capitol,

1596
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,120
the strategic blunder of the selfies and the cute art stuff

1597
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,640
and all the rest of it is not what Trump wanted.

1598
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,480
It's not what I wanted.

1599
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,960
That was our rally to try to put pressure on them to have

1600
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,840
a 10 day investigation of election fraud.

1601
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,240
So wait, do you think what happened to the Capitol

1602
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,440
was a victory or a fiasco?

1603
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,480
I definitely think it was the right thing

1604
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,400
for the wrong reasons.

1605
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,640
I think it was a good way to make government

1606
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,680
for the people again.

1607
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,000
It was nice to see members of Congress on their knees

1608
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,720
fearing the people.

1609
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,880
I think it was the right thing for the wrong reasons.

1610
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,440
So you now wish that people wouldn't have knocked down

1611
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,960
the doors and gone in there?

1612
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,840
I wish 100% that people would do it more all over this country

1613
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,600
and make government for the people.

1614
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,920
So that's a little bit fucked up.

1615
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,760
Yeah, yeah.

1616
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,160
Yeah, there is nothing quite so terrifying as a zealot.

1617
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,480
Especially a 20 year old.

1618
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1619
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,320
But also I can think of a lot of historical problems

1620
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,440
that come from 20 year old zealots.

1621
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,920
He is also limiting his own personal involvement

1622
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,520
with the Capitol and the storming of it.

1623
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,280
There's an article in Reuters from January 8th

1624
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,840
that says that Mike Dunn, quote, who lives in Virginia

1625
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,920
said three or four groups of loyalists under his command

1626
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,480
helped storm the Capitol this week amid a motley mix

1627
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,760
of rioters who supported President Donald Trump's

1628
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,680
attempt to overturn the results of the November

1629
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,120
presidential election.

1630
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,040
While most boogaloos are libertarians

1631
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,840
who largely oppose Trump, Dunn said

1632
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,880
the group embraced the moment to strike against the government.

1633
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,000
So I don't know.

1634
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,960
Like, if this Reuters article is wrong?

1635
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,120
Right.

1636
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,240
But he downplays his own involvement.

1637
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,560
And it seems like there might be some disingenuousness

1638
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,760
on his part in terms of his exact actions.

1639
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,200
I just don't think that you can get away with commanding people

1640
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,080
to overthrow the Capitol.

1641
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,840
It seems like this Reuters article, if true,

1642
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,440
is a problem.

1643
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,840
Yeah, yeah.

1644
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,360
That said, I don't know.

1645
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,040
Yeah, that's fair.

1646
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,760
I do know that that is a point that Alex really hoped

1647
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,880
would show some sort of weakness on Mike's part.

1648
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:05,560
But no, he stands firm to what he has a consistency.

1649
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,400
And I'm not saying that as a positive thing.

1650
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,640
No, no, no.

1651
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,520
I believe I just pointed out, zealotry, terrifying.

1652
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,840
Yeah, yeah.

1653
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,960
So Owen Troyer is there, like I said.

1654
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:19,440
And he pops his little head in to say, hey, how's it going?

1655
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,960
And then he indicates that, hey, I'm into this stuff.

1656
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:22,680
I like it.

1657
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,600
I like it.

1658
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,360
We got to do it later.

1659
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,520
OK, all right, great.

1660
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:30,080
And then Alex, you could tell, is getting a little heated.

1661
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,720
There's no doubt that we have encroaching global government.

1662
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,080
There's no doubt that the government's out of control.

1663
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,280
There's no doubt that the biggest crooks in America

1664
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,720
are in Washington, DC.

1665
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,200
I think 90% of Americans would agree to that.

1666
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,600
Here's the problem, though.

1667
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,400
And Mike, I'd like to get your response to this.

1668
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,080
We're not in a 1776 colonists versus the British government

1669
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,680
time, where we're hiding in the woods.

1670
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,440
And we've got the local communities.

1671
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,980
And they don't have a world technocracy set up against us,

1672
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,640
or a federal government set up against us.

1673
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,920
I mean, I've been to jail multiple times

1674
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:03,720
for my free speech.

1675
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,680
You know that.

1676
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,040
So I mean, to sit here and say.

1677
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,720
Oh, you've done nothing because you didn't stand around

1678
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,080
in a Hawaiian shirt with a gun.

1679
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,200
Whoa.

1680
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,160
All right, Alex.

1681
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,280
All right, I'm not going to just let these two young dick

1682
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,680
wads talk around me without me asserting some dominance.

1683
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,000
And Alex is being a real dick.

1684
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,560
I mean, like.

1685
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1686
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,400
Absolutely.

1687
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,800
I'm not going to sit here and like feel bad, too bad for Mike.

1688
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:28,000
But like, you know, I can tell he's being rude.

1689
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Alex is being rude.

1690
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,920
I am not winning the war of ideas somehow.

1691
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,200
Alex invited this guy to be on his show.

1692
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,480
And now he's just being a dick to him because he's

1693
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,480
failed to take the upper ground in this argument.

1694
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,880
As usual, he's pouting and he's throwing a fit.

1695
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:44,600
Yeah.

1696
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,560
And in this next clip, again, we return to this theme.

1697
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:50,960
It's like, if you were real, you would kill my enemies.

1698
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,280
But I'm telling you that the target, if Boogaloo's are real.

1699
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,480
I'm not saying do this.

1700
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,840
But if you really want a violent revolution,

1701
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,960
you should be calling for the Council on Foreign Relations.

1702
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,000
Every member should be in a deck of cards,

1703
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,240
the whole leadership, Richard and Haas, all the rest of them.

1704
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,840
And the last thing I want is anything

1705
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,240
to happen to Bill Gates or Richard and Haas or any of them.

1706
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,400
I'm just saying, if you really want to do this,

1707
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,440
Klaus Schwab should be the ace of spades.

1708
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,320
And then Bill Gates is, you know, right after that.

1709
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:18,640
OK, I'm just telling you, man, you're hitting the wrong target.

1710
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,320
Oh, boy.

1711
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:28,360
So you are not endorsing him.

1712
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:32,880
But you are saying, if you take out my targets, I like you.

1713
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,520
I will consider you real.

1714
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,680
You'll be real.

1715
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:39,000
Yeah, you wouldn't be you wouldn't be suspected

1716
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,200
of being SPLC, ADL-run false flaggers

1717
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,560
if only you did kill Richard and Haas.

1718
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,200
Listen, I'm not telling you that I want anything bad

1719
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,280
to happen to Bill Gates.

1720
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,280
But, you know.

1721
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:59,600
But I am going to use the same sort of visual metaphor

1722
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,760
that was used in the War on Terror, Saddam Hussein.

1723
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,200
Hey, hey, you know, you said, I asked you

1724
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,480
what the plan was.

1725
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,320
And you came back with, it should be my idea.

1726
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,600
And my idea is that you should take out these targets.

1727
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,840
Oh, shit, I'm in it, aren't I?

1728
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,640
Oh, no.

1729
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,440
Fuck.

1730
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,800
So Alex comes back from break.

1731
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,600
They're talking.

1732
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:25,360
And now the Proud Boys, under the bus,

1733
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:28,800
does not look like they're going to be heroes.

1734
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,800
Oh, god.

1735
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,800
Although Alex is walking a little bit of a fine line

1736
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,080
with this.

1737
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:32,600
Because he's not.

1738
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,600
He's saying that he still supports the Proud Boys

1739
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,440
and what have you.

1740
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,480
He is a Proud Boy.

1741
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,320
He's now lumping them in with forces

1742
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,000
that might have acted no good.

1743
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,200
Sure.

1744
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,120
I'm not an informant like Enrique Tarrio.

1745
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,880
But at the same time, I want to expose the federal forces that

1746
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,320
are involved in this.

1747
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,880
We identified Boogaloos.

1748
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,720
And we identified Proud Boys leading the attack

1749
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,080
on the capital of Antifa.

1750
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,720
And I'm now bringing all this out today.

1751
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,960
I was already intending to before this broke about Tarrio.

1752
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:00,400
Sure.

1753
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,360
So.

1754
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,000
And we have the footage.

1755
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,880
So no Boogaloos win the capital.

1756
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,600
Put it up of a Boogaloo boy walking into the capital.

1757
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,280
And I will.

1758
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,640
Hold on, they have their faces covered.

1759
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,040
But I mean, well, we got you saying

1760
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,680
you have fire teams inside the capital.

1761
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,320
But I'm going to ask you right now.

1762
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:17,800
Building.

1763
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,200
You said we're inside the capital.

1764
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,320
You said that doesn't mean what you said.

1765
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,520
DC is the capital, not the capital building.

1766
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,320
Capital building.

1767
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,400
Oh, DC is the capital.

1768
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,400
Oh, OK.

1769
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,600
Oops.

1770
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,160
Alex's big gotcha is a tweet.

1771
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,600
Or maybe it was a post on Parler.

1772
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,120
I'm not sure.

1773
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,960
But it's Mike saying that they have four fire

1774
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,640
teams at the capital.

1775
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,600
Right.

1776
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,760
With an A.

1777
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,640
Well, I don't know.

1778
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,960
I didn't actually see the tweet.

1779
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,600
But it makes sense that his explanation

1780
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,960
is we met the country's capital, not the building.

1781
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,560
Sir, sir, there are two words.

1782
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,800
I know they are homophones.

1783
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,160
They sound the same.

1784
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,880
Yeah, so Alex thinks that's a big gotcha

1785
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,720
because you have four teams inside the building.

1786
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,320
We were talking about Bain Capital.

1787
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,880
We went to the wrong building.

1788
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,160
I am really sorry about that.

1789
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,440
You see how quickly that gets resolved.

1790
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,360
He's like, I was talking about the city.

1791
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,040
Yeah.

1792
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:07,640
Yeah, yeah.

1793
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,920
And he was curt about it, too.

1794
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,200
He didn't try and dissemble.

1795
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,960
He was just like, there's a difference!

1796
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:12,360
Yeah.

1797
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:12,840
Yeah.

1798
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,040
And so this isn't going well.

1799
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,960
But Alex has blamed the Boogaloos

1800
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,560
as being the people who were the ones who had the zip ties.

1801
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,680
And they were the ones who were the actual really scary folks

1802
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,960
in the storming of the capital.

1803
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,080
They weren't the patriots.

1804
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,000
And Alex has said that he's proved these things.

1805
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,600
Yes, he has.

1806
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,400
He's not just saying, I think it's them.

1807
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,240
Pictures of you.

1808
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,720
Now, because this interview isn't going well,

1809
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,760
Alex kind of reveals that I'm just

1810
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,400
looking for someone to blame.

1811
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,800
And I decided it was you.

1812
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,440
Here's the deal.

1813
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,240
We're going to find out who these guys were

1814
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,800
in camo that had masks on.

1815
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:49,240
And we think they work for the FBI, OK?

1816
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,240
Because our president that really got elected

1817
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,960
is on trial in a week and a half.

1818
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,560
And we're pissed off about it, OK?

1819
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:57,000
And we wanted to put peaceful pressure on them

1820
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,160
to show our numbers.

1821
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,440
And we got screwed over by some people.

1822
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,080
We're going to find out who they are.

1823
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,720
You hear the headlines.

1824
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:04,720
Oh, boy.

1825
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,600
Oh, great.

1826
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,320
Yeah.

1827
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,160
That is not what someone would say

1828
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,360
if they've proved something.

1829
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,920
No, no.

1830
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:11,440
Nope.

1831
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,640
I have proven it's the Bugalo Boys.

1832
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,480
And we are going to find out who did it.

1833
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,840
And I think they work for the FBI.

1834
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,360
I'm pretty sure it was the FBI.

1835
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,760
We don't know who these people are, but we think they're FBI.

1836
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:21,880
We're going to find out.

1837
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,560
We're going to get to the bottom of this.

1838
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,680
Hey, Mike, have I ever told you about how I'm a psychic based

1839
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,800
on people's posture?

1840
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,160
It's like a body language expert,

1841
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,160
but I can tell from still photographs.

1842
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,440
Also, by the way, God gave me a vision

1843
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,600
30 years ago that laid all of this out for me.

1844
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,840
Mike, you're not really fitting into this vision.

1845
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,600
I'm confused.

1846
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:45,280
Mike, I think you might be working for the devil, Mike.

1847
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,320
You're the devil, Mike.

1848
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,960
Mike.

1849
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,840
See, now, I don't understand why he

1850
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:52,920
doesn't end every interview that doesn't go well with like,

1851
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,200
well, obviously, you're working for the devil, sir.

1852
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,880
And I must have you off my show.

1853
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,880
Obviously, this is a challenge that the devil

1854
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,680
has thrown my way.

1855
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,360
And I decide to rise above it.

1856
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,160
Click.

1857
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,120
Pass.

1858
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,280
Pass.

1859
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,720
The devil took Jesus into the desert for 40 days and 40

1860
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,360
nights, and on night one, Jesus said, nah, I'm out.

1861
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:15,440
Did you know that the devil is actually a booger boy?

1862
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,280
I did not know that.

1863
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,000
Alex proved that.

1864
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:17,600
That's fair.

1865
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,240
So like I said, Alex has claimed that he's

1866
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,600
proved all these things.

1867
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,160
When he's talking about it on his show,

1868
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:26,080
it's not like spitballing ideas.

1869
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,000
It's talking about we have definitive proof,

1870
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,600
sources have confirmed.

1871
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,600
We have the documents.

1872
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,800
Everything that it was, Antifa and Boogaloo Boys.

1873
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:36,480
It's all there.

1874
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:40,120
And some Q folks got tricked into going and taking selfies.

1875
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,880
And the Patriots were doing the right thing.

1876
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,120
They were fighting off Antifa.

1877
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,600
But they didn't actually go into the, yeah.

1878
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,800
They were trying to fight off Antifa.

1879
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,320
Oh, that's right.

1880
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:47,600
They're fighting off Antifa.

1881
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,960
But they got overwhelmed.

1882
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:49,640
Oh, yeah.

1883
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,640
Yeah.

1884
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,120
So when you hear a clip like this,

1885
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,800
it's just like, this is not, this is incongruous.

1886
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,800
We're trying to find out who the bravacaturgrips are.

1887
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,000
And I'll just say it.

1888
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,840
And I've said this.

1889
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,360
I'm not against the Proud Boys.

1890
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,360
They've been lied about.

1891
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,480
I don't think they're racist, all the other stuff.

1892
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:08,040
We know Proud Boys not wearing their outfits,

1893
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,760
not wearing their uniforms, that were

1894
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,280
part of the Capitol breach.

1895
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,080
We have tweets by you and by other people

1896
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,120
saying they supported the Capitol attack

1897
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,040
and that it was a great thing.

1898
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,800
Now you're kind of halfway backing off of that.

1899
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,160
What?

1900
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,480
I'm not here trying to get you arrested.

1901
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,000
Like who?

1902
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,360
My big question is, I see this Dr. Gold lady just

1903
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,520
going in being arrested.

1904
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:32,440
I see Brandon Straka, or Strak, being arrested when he

1905
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,200
was just there doing nothing.

1906
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,360
And then it freaks me out.

1907
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:35,720
Interesting way of putting that.

1908
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,040
Like who are the men in uniforms with masks

1909
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,360
handing out clubs saying, attack, attack, attack.

1910
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,640
That's my big question.

1911
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,520
So Alex, if he knew what was going on

1912
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,800
and he had the information that he claims to,

1913
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,640
he would not be trying to figure out

1914
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,400
who the provacaturgrips are.

1915
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,960
He would not be having the alleged leader

1916
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,600
of the Boogaloo's on and being like, well,

1917
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:00,240
we're just trying to spitball and figure out who did what.

1918
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:03,080
Also, there's video of Brandon Straka

1919
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,160
citing a crowd to steal a cop's shield.

1920
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,680
All he was doing was nothing.

1921
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,400
He's just not, he wasn't doing anything.

1922
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,680
He posted a video of himself yelling, take his shield.

1923
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:15,320
That's barely anything.

1924
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:20,400
What if, look, if he was in my hometown, Princeton, Illinois,

1925
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,920
nobody would be bothered by it.

1926
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,680
Right, but then they did take a guy's shield.

1927
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,480
OK, well, now there is that.

1928
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,160
There is that.

1929
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,760
That's hard to, I understand cause and effect.

1930
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,600
Brandon Straka's going to prison.

1931
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,600
I'm telling you, you know, cause and effect

1932
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,000
is really just the way we perceive

1933
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,240
entropy in the universe.

1934
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,000
So this has already happened.

1935
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:37,480
Yeah.

1936
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,240
Yeah.

1937
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,560
And I think that at this point in the interview,

1938
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,760
you can really tell that Alex is done.

1939
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:44,960
He's been defeated.

1940
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,040
He doesn't have the energy.

1941
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,000
It's just no good.

1942
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:48,800
Too young.

1943
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,920
You can see, Mike Dunn, where I'm a little concerned

1944
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:52,960
and I see this going on.

1945
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,480
I'm worried about the idea of your movement

1946
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,160
that anybody can say they're a Boogaloo.

1947
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,600
It's like, are you for anonymous?

1948
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,680
Well, anybody can be anonymous.

1949
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,440
Are you for Q?

1950
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:03,720
Anybody can be for Q. I mean, don't you worry that.

1951
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,560
For Infowars.

1952
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,760
Are you for Antifa?

1953
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,160
But explain to me Boogaloo, where it came from.

1954
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,440
Are you worried about being taken over?

1955
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:13,400
I mean, what do you think's really happening here?

1956
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,320
Since Boogaloo is an ideology, it's

1957
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,440
not necessarily a worry of being taken over

1958
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,720
because if somebody doesn't embody the ideology,

1959
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,120
then they're not Boogaloo.

1960
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,440
Boogaloo started as a meme, a joke back in like 2012.

1961
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,200
It was just an online joke.

1962
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,000
And then in 2019, several people started

1963
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
making it a little more public and actually turned it

1964
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,760
to an ideology or belief that liberty is for all

1965
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,280
and we're done being tread on.

1966
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,920
Yeah, and it's a joke meme that turned it

1967
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,600
to an ideology about the need for a second Civil War.

1968
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:47,640
So I don't think we can sort of eliminate that and pretend

1969
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,640
that that's not a piece of this.

1970
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,920
I think that's fairly important.

1971
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:54,000
But Alex signaling defeat there and just being like,

1972
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
well, you know, look, I'm just trying to tell you

1973
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,800
that your group can be co-opted.

1974
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,640
That is an attempt at a trick.

1975
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:06,040
That is a false move backwards into a pose of submission.

1976
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,560
It's a sidestep, more like.

1977
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:15,040
Yes, because then Alex tries to get him to sort of what's

1978
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:15,760
it called?

1979
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,840
What's the pleading the fifth?

1980
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,600
Incriminate.

1981
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,960
Yes, self-incriminate.

1982
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,880
Alex is trying to get him to self-incriminate.

1983
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:22,680
Great.

1984
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:26,960
Yeah, look, look, here's my issue.

1985
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,560
Are you guys putting on a manifesto of targets

1986
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,840
because, you know, random police, capitals, that's

1987
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,160
I mean, that's just a seat of what the people should

1988
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,320
be in control of.

1989
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,200
I mean, I'm not calling for targets, God forbid.

1990
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,760
I don't want any violence.

1991
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,800
What about Bill Gates?

1992
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,400
What about Ted Turner?

1993
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,480
What people trying to put poison vaccines in us?

1994
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,920
What about the UN?

1995
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,840
So tell me, tell me in a deck of cards

1996
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,600
like Saddam Hussein was the top target, 2003.

1997
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,280
Like, who's the ace of spades for you guys?

1998
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:57,760
It would be ignorant to sit here and release a manifesto

1999
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:58,880
or say this is a target.

2000
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,720
Yeah, so let's not mention any real evil kingpins, right?

2001
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,600
I'm not going to allow you to be in the same,

2002
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,560
something like that.

2003
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,080
Say that again?

2004
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,720
I'm not going to allow you to go be in the same,

2005
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,720
something like that.

2006
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,360
That would be ridiculous.

2007
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,360
Oh, like the Southern Poverty Law Center

2008
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,040
does posing as malicious, goading people into stuff?

2009
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,560
Maybe you're Scott Hill.

2010
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,160
Oh, maybe.

2011
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,000
Oh, maybe I am.

2012
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,360
Oh, shit.

2013
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:24,880
Listen, what I'm telling you is I'm going to save this country.

2014
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:25,560
OK.

2015
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,880
This is the Spider-Man meme.

2016
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:27,360
This is.

2017
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,080
This is the Spider-Man meme.

2018
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,400
It's just what this is.

2019
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,400
Oh, I'm the bad guy.

2020
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,640
No, you're the bad guy.

2021
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,280
All right, this isn't going well for me.

2022
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,840
So tell me who you want to kill on there.

2023
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:37,400
Yeah, exactly.

2024
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:38,800
Alex, that's a stupid idea.

2025
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,920
I'm not going to do that.

2026
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,280
Oh, look at you.

2027
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,360
Look at you.

2028
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,720
Oh, you're SPL.

2029
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,400
That's what you are.

2030
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,840
Oh, my God.

2031
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,080
That is so funny.

2032
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:51,760
Yeah, but I mean, like, God bless.

2033
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,280
I mean, like, God bless.

2034
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,040
I don't know how I would phrase it.

2035
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,000
It shows some wherewithal for Mike

2036
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,040
to recognize, like, I'm not going to talk like this on air.

2037
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,480
Yeah, no, I think it's a good.

2038
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,960
I would say nice move.

2039
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:09,160
If this was Bobby Fischer versus Kasparov,

2040
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,920
it would be like, nice move, sir.

2041
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:14,120
It would be an unnecessary error to make.

2042
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:17,760
It would be a blunder, in fact, to continue the chess metaphor.

2043
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,800
So Alex, I think he also makes it a little too

2044
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,320
obvious in this conversation that this is personal.

2045
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,240
Like, this really feels personal.

2046
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,560
And in this clip, Alex is going to express

2047
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:35,040
that by way of being like, hey, I'm the real person fighting

2048
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:39,120
for liberty, and you can prove that because a bunch of people

2049
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,320
are suing me.

2050
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,880
Is anyone suing you, Mike?

2051
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,320
That's fair.

2052
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:48,160
I want to save this country, and running around storming

2053
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:50,800
capitals is not the way to do it.

2054
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,200
Either the courts or not, Alex, the country is not safe.

2055
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,280
Let me ask you a question.

2056
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,640
Do you have 50 Democratic lawsuits against you?

2057
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,200
What to say again?

2058
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,680
Do you have the Democratic Party financing your destruction

2059
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:04,040
like I do?

2060
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,040
I don't know, nor do I care.

2061
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,360
I'm going to stand by what I do.

2062
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,640
No, I'm asking you, see, why am I under so much attack?

2063
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,880
Because I know nothing.

2064
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,800
I'm this coward.

2065
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,000
I thought it was because you were a piece of shit.

2066
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,080
I've never done anything.

2067
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,960
And you're this, because you walk around with a gun,

2068
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,720
it's like, oh my god, I'm supposed

2069
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,960
to fall down on my knees.

2070
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,120
And like, holy hell, this is my leader.

2071
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,760
I mean, seriously, you keep telling me that I stood down.

2072
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,520
You said, my generation stood down.

2073
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,120
Bull.

2074
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,560
My generation didn't stand down.

2075
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,480
It's the fact that you're doing the same thing

2076
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:31,920
that's been done for years, and it's not

2077
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:32,960
accomplishing anything.

2078
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,640
The only thing that's going to accomplish

2079
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,800
is forcing a revolution.

2080
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,160
I am not doing the same thing.

2081
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,520
I'm not Democrat, Republican.

2082
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,960
I'm exposing the globalist program.

2083
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,880
Do you understand that information is powerful?

2084
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,720
They're scared of it?

2085
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:45,600
You're talking.

2086
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,600
That's all you're doing.

2087
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,240
You're doing the same thing that's been done for years.

2088
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,840
So now you are admitting you told people

2089
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,680
to storm the Capitol.

2090
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,280
Because you're not like me, a coward.

2091
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,040
You're a big man.

2092
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,400
You are a woman.

2093
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,280
I have not told anybody to storm the Capitol.

2094
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,440
I've preached revolution, and I always will.

2095
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:03,480
So Alex is trying to, again, incriminate him.

2096
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,800
He's trying to get him in this thing where it's like, oh, you

2097
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,200
told people to storm the Capitol.

2098
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,800
Because then, like, afterwards, Alex

2099
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,640
can still use that for his narratives

2100
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,960
if he gets him into that box.

2101
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:12,440
Right.

2102
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,200
And not least of which, he wants this guy emotional.

2103
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:15,680
Yes.

2104
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:18,960
He wants this guy to be like, no, I did tell

2105
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,480
people to storm the Capitol.

2106
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,760
Yeah, whereas there's a poise to it just being like,

2107
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,520
no, you guys, you are engaging in the same sort of shit

2108
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:29,680
that doesn't achieve any of the goals you profess to have,

2109
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,200
and we're going to force a revolution.

2110
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,520
Now, that idea there is the accelerationist idea.

2111
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:41,400
The force of revolution is not something that is,

2112
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:46,720
it's not what goes well with the public-facing idea

2113
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:51,080
of the Boogaloo types that want you to think like, oh, we're

2114
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,920
just here standing around making sure nothing gets out of control.

2115
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:54,440
Right.

2116
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,920
It's like, no, you're there because you

2117
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:56,840
want to force a revolution.

2118
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2119
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,840
And you want something to go bad,

2120
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,640
and people start shooting each other.

2121
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:04,140
Right.

2122
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:07,640
And I think one of the most difficult things for Alex

2123
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,400
is he doesn't understand that their agenda begins

2124
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,720
with revolution.

2125
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:15,000
There's no, like, I don't think they

2126
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,720
care what strikes it either.

2127
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,040
If it was a left-wing cause, they would be like,

2128
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,240
yeah, let's go and the revolution

2129
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,680
is what their goal is.

2130
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,200
Yeah, yeah.

2131
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,920
So you can't really be like, oh, see, you're so stupid.

2132
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,000
And it's like, no, we just didn't succeed yet.

2133
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
The goal is still a revolution.

2134
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,640
We're not changing our goal because we lose.

2135
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:39,880
Yeah, and I would say that based on this reporting in Reuters,

2136
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:44,040
if accurate, is counter to what Mike

2137
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,520
is presenting here on the show.

2138
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:49,160
And I have some question about that.

2139
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,360
I don't know what the reality is.

2140
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,760
I wasn't there.

2141
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,360
But it does seem to be like, at least a reason to be like,

2142
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,000
I don't think that you're above board.

2143
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,080
I don't think that you're being honest here.

2144
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:05,080
Now, here's where things turn a little bit more hostile.

2145
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:08,200
Alex brings up that the Boogaloo types

2146
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:11,960
were trying to get a second march going

2147
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:15,360
after January 6, an armed march in DC.

2148
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:21,040
Alex conflates Boogaloo types and Mike personally

2149
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,320
and is accusing Mike of trying to get people

2150
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:27,000
to do an armed march while they sit back and watch

2151
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,720
the chaos happen.

2152
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,520
And Mike.

2153
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,520
Mike, you're pulling a me, right?

2154
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,480
And Mike calls Alex a liar.

2155
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,760
The Boogaloo supreme leadership, whoever they are,

2156
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:42,240
said, go to DC the weekend after the 6 and have armed marches.

2157
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,680
But you guys didn't show up.

2158
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,400
So you were trying to get other people to come into DC.

2159
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,560
And she could sit back and eat popcorn and watch that.

2160
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,000
Or was that not the Boogaloo that said that?

2161
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,280
It's the word you like, Alex.

2162
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:55,800
It's called a psyop, brother.

2163
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:56,800
Oh, a psyop.

2164
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,320
So you're not going to respond to the stack of tweets

2165
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,560
I've got and messages from you saying,

2166
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:06,120
we're going to have an armed march three days after the 6.

2167
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,320
Yeah, Alex, you're a liar.

2168
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,200
Show the tweet where I said we're going to have an armed march.

2169
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,200
Oh, shit.

2170
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,560
Show the tweet where I said.

2171
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,000
So the Boogaloo's did not call.

2172
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,400
They didn't say, armed march is still on for DC.

2173
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,040
We're going to have it.

2174
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:22,040
Show the tweet where I said there's going to be an armed march.

2175
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,440
I'm at the Boogaloo lordship.

2176
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,680
Well, you said you're not the lordship.

2177
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:28,440
I said I'm not the leader, correct.

2178
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,320
Oh, so you don't have any problems or anything.

2179
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:33,240
Have you ever been to the ADL or Southern Poverty Law Center

2180
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,560
headquarters?

2181
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,360
I don't care to go to any of those places

2182
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,120
because I can care less about them.

2183
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:43,800
So Alex is now just like, this is falling apart.

2184
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,000
Yeah.

2185
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,360
Alex was conflating other Boogaloo people

2186
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,320
and this guy personally.

2187
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,520
And this guy calls it out that you're saying that I did this.

2188
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,080
I didn't do that.

2189
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,840
And Alex realizes like, ah, shit.

2190
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,920
I did just get called out on that sleight of hand.

2191
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,840
Hey, have you ever been to the SPLC Center?

2192
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:07,160
To tangentially imply that you're an agent provocateur,

2193
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,800
I'm not even going to say it.

2194
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,280
I'm going to be like, hey, you ever been to these places?

2195
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:15,160
Yeah, this is soft.

2196
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,080
Weak tea.

2197
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,280
Weak tea.

2198
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,520
So Alex now goes out to break and he thinks

2199
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,840
he's won a little bit.

2200
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,560
I think he thinks he's got some win back.

2201
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,160
He's saved face.

2202
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,760
Because he's made some suggestion.

2203
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:29,200
And then he also got Mike to say that an armed march on DC

2204
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,280
a week after the storming of the Capitol

2205
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,720
would be an unwise strategic move.

2206
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,280
And somehow this is hypocritical,

2207
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,800
although I think Alex agrees.

2208
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,240
I don't know what's going on anymore.

2209
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,720
I have said that no armed march in DC.

2210
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,840
And armed march in DC would be unwise.

2211
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,320
I said that repeatedly.

2212
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:45,800
Well, good.

2213
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:46,360
Good for you.

2214
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:47,880
I remember the Boogaloo said that.

2215
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,560
So wait, I thought you were a man of action, though.

2216
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,200
You just said that I'm the coward.

2217
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,320
You're the man of action.

2218
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,240
Wise action.

2219
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,400
Wise action.

2220
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,160
Wise action.

2221
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:58,240
I go to Capitol so we can punk the police department,

2222
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,000
punk City Council.

2223
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,840
You told me earlier that we should not follow the law.

2224
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,080
You said I'm a coward.

2225
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,480
I follow the law.

2226
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,880
You don't follow the law because you're for revolution.

2227
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:08,360
Correct.

2228
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,240
I am for revolution.

2229
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,480
But I am for a wise revolution, which

2230
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,760
is where we go to these capitals, we punk the PDs,

2231
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,880
we punk the City Councils that want to make unlawful cops.

2232
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,480
We punk the PDs.

2233
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,440
Yeah, because the local cops are our issue.

2234
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:19,320
All right, all right.

2235
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:22,080
Hey, you are the Boogaloo, lordship.

2236
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:26,000
We're going to come right back if you're still here with us.

2237
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,640
You hear that laughing because Alex

2238
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,800
thinks like he's got a dog.

2239
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,480
Got him.

2240
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:30,160
Got him.

2241
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,440
I finally got him.

2242
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,880
Don't think so.

2243
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,640
Don't think you got anything there.

2244
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:38,040
No, I'm very bored with this conversation.

2245
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,040
I'm annoyed by it.

2246
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:43,880
It sounds way too much like a fucking Philosophy 101

2247
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:48,120
course where they're like, well, I'm for platonic ideals

2248
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:50,080
and I'm for existentialism.

2249
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,440
And it's like you're both stupid.

2250
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,960
I don't appreciate this.

2251
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,480
And this is even worse because you guys are not

2252
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,960
arguing about philosophy.

2253
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,600
You're like, how do we kill all these people?

2254
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,760
I think that I can relate to what you're talking about

2255
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,120
in that I think it's very stupid and it's a frustrating

2256
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,640
conversation to listen to.

2257
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,360
But I do still think that there's an importance to it.

2258
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:12,120
Oh, no, that's what I'm saying.

2259
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,600
OK, well, we're talking about how to kill everyone.

2260
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,560
Right.

2261
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,400
And you're also seeing just yet another example

2262
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,440
of how the ecosystems that have been spawned

2263
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,720
by people like Alex have now outgrown them

2264
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:32,120
to a point where they are able to embarrass him.

2265
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2266
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,080
The young eat the old, Dan.

2267
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,760
It's how it's always going to go.

2268
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,400
It does feel a bit like that.

2269
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:42,040
There is a theme of that.

2270
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:45,400
So they come back as Mike did not

2271
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:48,400
leave after Alex routinely insulted him and suggested

2272
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,760
that he went to the SPLC.

2273
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,280
Sure.

2274
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,480
And Mike repays the favor by blowing up

2275
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,680
one of Alex's narratives and makes it clear that Antifa

2276
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,120
was not at the Capitol.

2277
01:22:59,120 --> 01:22:59,840
Uh-oh.

2278
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,520
What I said was I would not encourage an open arm march

2279
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:05,760
on DC, which is what I've said repeatedly, because I find it

2280
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:09,920
a poor tactical plan, a poor strategy.

2281
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,000
So I know you like blowing things out of proportion

2282
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,120
and trying to pay me as the bad guy or pay me as illogical.

2283
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,400
But I've been consistent with what I'm saying.

2284
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,920
You just keep trying to twist out, man.

2285
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:19,440
No, Mike.

2286
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,080
I'm trying to find out who the guys in camo

2287
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,240
are that lead the attack with Antifa

2288
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,880
and then get a few, maybe 100 idiots to go in with them

2289
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,040
so that they can destroy the peaceful movement.

2290
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:33,920
Look, I've been around quite a few Antifa.

2291
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,480
There are some Antifa that are good.

2292
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,560
The majority we've not had good interactions with,

2293
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,520
we do not support.

2294
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:39,880
But there are some that are good.

2295
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,560
But I've interacted with a lot of Antifa.

2296
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,360
And I can assure you that they were not

2297
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:46,960
Antifa that were on that front line in that Capitol riot.

2298
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:50,120
So trying to find somebody to point fingers at,

2299
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,680
you're failing when you're pointing at Antifa.

2300
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,480
They were not there.

2301
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:53,400
Oh, I'm failing.

2302
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,560
Even though they arrested an Antifa leader that

2303
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:58,480
said he brought 100 there, I saw a bunch of skinny jean guys

2304
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,240
helping do it.

2305
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,200
Oh, so this was all Trump people.

2306
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,720
Yeah, it's called an op, Alex, the same thing

2307
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:06,520
that you preached about.

2308
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:07,200
What's an op?

2309
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,160
It's not.

2310
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:08,680
It's not.

2311
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,280
It's simply not true.

2312
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,360
Oh, so OK.

2313
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,560
So should Trump be arrested for inciting this?

2314
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,200
Probably.

2315
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,520
I think there are a lot of other problems

2316
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:21,480
that Trump should be arrested for.

2317
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,800
I don't believe he incited the insurrection at the Capitol.

2318
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,160
No, but I believe there's a lot of other crimes

2319
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:26,200
he should be arrested for.

2320
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,360
So have you ever met?

2321
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:34,600
Have you ever talked to Southern Poverty Law Center?

2322
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,560
I don't believe so.

2323
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:36,840
Maybe I talk to a lot of people.

2324
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,760
A lot of people call me, ask questions, reporters, agencies.

2325
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,280
I have no clue.

2326
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:44,400
Oh, and you want to put any bookends on this?

2327
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,680
I mean, this is just a mess.

2328
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:49,600
That's just a dude giving up.

2329
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,360
He asks him a second time, have you been to the SPLC?

2330
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:53,840
Brutal.

2331
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,760
Talk to them.

2332
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,360
And now he's just like, Owen, you got anything?

2333
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,160
See, now that's the problem with getting

2334
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,960
that brief moment of victory.

2335
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,040
It makes the gut punch loss all the worse.

2336
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2337
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:08,240
And Owen doesn't do much better.

2338
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:11,240
He starts talking about now that Trump is out,

2339
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,080
maybe there's some stuff we can do.

2340
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,480
Now we can argue about it.

2341
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,720
Maybe there's some stuff we can do, now we

2342
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,600
can organize against war.

2343
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,040
Sure, sure.

2344
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:20,720
Thanks, Owen.

2345
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:24,840
And this actually brings up Mike having a decent point.

2346
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,440
And that is like, you could have done that before.

2347
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,440
We have to become unified.

2348
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,480
So we can organize against the wars,

2349
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,280
against the surveillance, against the mask,

2350
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:34,640
against the forced inoculation.

2351
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:36,440
I think that's a positive thing.

2352
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:40,520
Let me ask Lord Boogaloo, do you agree with that, Lord Boogaloo?

2353
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,640
So I'm 100% clear.

2354
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:43,720
You're cool with the tyranny.

2355
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,160
It's the tyranny that you like, which would be Donald Trump.

2356
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,680
I just want to make sure I'm tracking on that.

2357
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,240
So you're not actually against tyranny.

2358
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,800
You're not actually for revolution.

2359
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,240
You're only for doing it when somebody is in office

2360
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:54,920
that you don't agree with.

2361
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:55,680
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

2362
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,600
I just talked about all of us unifying

2363
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,240
against forced inoculations of Joe Biden.

2364
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,320
Trump's gone.

2365
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,840
You wouldn't do it like Trump was in office

2366
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:04,280
because you didn't stand against Trump.

2367
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,520
You stood for the very time.

2368
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:06,920
Well, I didn't stand around.

2369
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,800
I didn't stand around with a gun in front of stuff and say,

2370
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,800
hold on now.

2371
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,880
That's another cheap shot, Mr. Fireteam.

2372
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,080
We have fire teams in the Capitol.

2373
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,040
We have taken the Capitol.

2374
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,600
We are commando based Delta.

2375
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,520
Come on, don't get mad, Mr. Dumb.

2376
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,800
We're back in 60 seconds.

2377
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,160
Alex is complaining about cheap shots

2378
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:34,120
and he keeps calling him Lord Boogaloo and like the high master.

2379
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:34,880
Mr. Dumb?

2380
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:35,720
Mr. Dumb?

2381
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:36,360
Mr. Dumb.

2382
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:37,240
Oh, Mr. Dumb.

2383
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,080
I thought he said Mr. Dumb.

2384
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,960
No, that would have been too far.

2385
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,160
I was like, wow, you ended with Mr. Dumb, huh?

2386
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:45,200
OK.

2387
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:50,000
But yeah, so they're talking about unity and unifying.

2388
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,400
And it's like, we can now get together with folks

2389
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,840
and fight against the war and all this.

2390
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:58,120
And Mike's point is pretty fair that it's like, well,

2391
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:01,880
you had no interest in reaching out to any other groups

2392
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,320
when Trump was in office.

2393
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:06,600
You weren't concerned with what inroads

2394
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,400
you could make with cooperation because that's

2395
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:10,840
the tyranny that you enjoy.

2396
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:12,320
Yep.

2397
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:12,800
Yeah.

2398
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,160
Which again, is a good point.

2399
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,400
I don't want it coming from him.

2400
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:16,320
No, no, no.

2401
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:22,800
He's essentially saying your belief system is incoherent

2402
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,240
and Alex is proving it.

2403
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:27,160
And Alex is trying to say his belief system is incoherent

2404
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,880
and he's proving that it's not.

2405
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,120
They're awful.

2406
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,760
All of them are awful.

2407
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:34,880
But when you have a coherent belief system

2408
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,680
and you are in an interview with someone who doesn't,

2409
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,560
they're going to be like a wave on the mountain.

2410
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,520
So you've got nothing.

2411
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,040
Yeah.

2412
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,520
And Alex totally misses the point

2413
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,360
that Mike was trying to make about how like, oh, yeah,

2414
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:49,000
all this stuff, these real problems

2415
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,160
that you could have found common cause with some other group

2416
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,920
that maybe you politically disagree with.

2417
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,480
He had no interest in any kind of unity before,

2418
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:00,120
but now you do because Trump is not in office anymore.

2419
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:02,560
He completely misses that point.

2420
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,440
So the problem is, oh, and it's the same thing

2421
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,400
I've seen with Republicans across the border,

2422
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:10,040
people who identify as conservative or white.

2423
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,360
Is that you're all for unity when it fits your idea.

2424
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,680
You're all for, oh, let's ally with Black Lives Matter

2425
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:15,960
or let's be friends with Black Lives Matter

2426
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,840
because we got a stand against the government

2427
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,160
because Joe Biden's in office

2428
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,800
and his administration controls.

2429
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,880
Where was that unity when Trump infringed

2430
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:23,720
upon the Second Amendment?

2431
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,280
But that's not fair, though.

2432
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,960
That's not fair.

2433
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,160
I didn't work with Black Lives Matter.

2434
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,640
You did, Boogie Lou.

2435
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:33,240
That's exactly the point that Mike is making.

2436
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,120
Yes, exactly.

2437
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:34,960
Yeah.

2438
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,040
How can you both call for unity now

2439
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,440
and then proudly say,

2440
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,600
I would never work with Black Lives Matter.

2441
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:41,640
And I didn't before.

2442
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:42,640
Exactly.

2443
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:45,160
Because I have, wait, what was I saying?

2444
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:47,120
And then he calls him Boogie Lou.

2445
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,200
More pejorative.

2446
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:53,760
So we've already seen a couple of instances

2447
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,720
of Alex trying to paint Mike

2448
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:58,800
as a Southern Poverty Law Center collaborator.

2449
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,160
And now Alex pulls out, he will talk to the FBI.

2450
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,000
Okay.

2451
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,760
Let's ask this question of the Grand Boogaloo.

2452
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:09,160
What comes next in the Boogaloo universe?

2453
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:11,560
Or is there no, it's an ideology.

2454
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:13,600
Who creates, who's the high priest?

2455
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,880
Who creates the ideology?

2456
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,320
Or does it just flow forth from where?

2457
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,400
It's autonomous.

2458
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:20,640
And the next thing is unity.

2459
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,200
Unifying the lower bodies,

2460
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,640
the people that were subject to this globalism

2461
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,960
that you speak of and this elitist mentality

2462
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:31,840
that is running the US through our governmental officials.

2463
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:32,960
It's unifying those people

2464
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,160
and getting ready to stand physically

2465
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,000
to defend our rights, our life,

2466
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,200
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

2467
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,080
Well, I mean, I think people have a right to stand up

2468
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,200
and I think they should.

2469
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,040
Let me ask you this.

2470
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,440
Have you been contacted by the FBI?

2471
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,880
Yes, I have.

2472
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,600
You're not, you're not,

2473
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,640
there's a joke in the Boogaloo that you're not Boogaloo.

2474
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:53,320
You know, you haven't been questioned.

2475
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:56,000
So the FBI has been all over us.

2476
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,880
So what'd the FBI say?

2477
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,320
What'd they come to you about?

2478
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,760
They like asking questions, that's all.

2479
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,320
And I don't like giving them answers.

2480
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,120
So if that paints a good picture for you, I hope it does.

2481
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,200
Well, I just think what happened at the Capitol

2482
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:13,760
was called screwing the pooch

2483
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,720
and it ruined the great thing we had set up

2484
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,320
and it gave the left a major victory.

2485
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:19,160
I was really hoping to blame you for it.

2486
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:21,440
I was really hoping this interview would end up

2487
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,000
with me being able to blame you for it,

2488
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,720
but you have been going circles around me.

2489
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:28,160
I guess you're an FBI informant

2490
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,200
or maybe you're working for the FBI.

2491
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,040
I don't know.

2492
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,520
You mean, just go away.

2493
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:35,480
I think Alex expected some caginess or some non-answer

2494
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:36,760
when he asked if you've talked to the FBI.

2495
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:37,640
Of course I have.

2496
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,080
Yeah, the FBI is coming for me.

2497
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:44,800
Duh, I'm voluntarily and loudly calling for a revolution.

2498
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,560
Of course the FBI is coming for me.

2499
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,280
I've talked to them and I stonewall them.

2500
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:51,320
The only reason I've been murdered is because I'm white.

2501
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:55,240
So Mike at this point has to clarify to Alex

2502
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:56,840
because Alex is trying to pretend

2503
01:30:56,840 --> 01:31:00,040
that they aren't anti-globalist

2504
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:01,800
because they don't target the same people

2505
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:04,640
that Alex does and they haven't killed Bill Gates yet.

2506
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,480
And so Mike has to clarify

2507
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:10,040
that they're opposed to the New World Order

2508
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,920
and then this goes way off the rails.

2509
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:14,920
The Capitol is a symbol of us voting.

2510
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:15,960
Just because it's been captured

2511
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:17,560
doesn't mean we attack that.

2512
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:18,840
The New World Order,

2513
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,120
I'm not trying to get you to go attack people.

2514
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:22,120
I'm just saying, if I saw a movement saying

2515
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:24,360
we're going after Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab

2516
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:25,880
and the Rothschilds, the New World Order

2517
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,560
and the CFR building in New York,

2518
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:28,680
I'd say those guys are real.

2519
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,360
They're about to get a fight.

2520
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,360
Because about 10 minutes after you said that,

2521
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,680
they would be having the HRT SWAT teams

2522
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:35,880
will be coming after your ass.

2523
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:38,600
Within a day, you're going to get a SWAT team.

2524
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,880
Alex, what have I said repeatedly?

2525
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:41,480
I have said repeatedly that we stand against

2526
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:42,920
the globalist and the elites

2527
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:44,320
that continue to control this country.

2528
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,160
So when you're saying,

2529
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,240
oh, if I saw people that run after that,

2530
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:48,440
we'd literally stand against it.

2531
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:50,760
We stand against the pedophilia that's prevalent in Hollywood.

2532
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:53,320
We stand against media controlling people.

2533
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:55,080
We stand against the elitists that run our government.

2534
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,720
We stand against the money that run our government.

2535
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,400
It's just that we're going in a slightly different way

2536
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:00,520
than what you agree with.

2537
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,120
All I wanted to come on here and say, Alex,

2538
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:03,640
if you'll allow me to finish real quick,

2539
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:05,160
all I wanted to come on here and say, man,

2540
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,920
is these people out there putting in the work,

2541
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:08,360
you know, you called them CIA ops,

2542
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:09,640
you said release the boogaloo.

2543
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:11,080
You know, you like to make your jokes,

2544
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,520
but these people are legitimate people

2545
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:13,400
who are putting in the work

2546
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,000
and believing in what they stand for.

2547
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:16,840
There are people in the boogaloo movement

2548
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,040
who don't agree with me.

2549
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,320
There are people in the boogaloo movement

2550
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:20,520
who are different than me,

2551
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:21,640
but these people put in works.

2552
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:22,600
They're not CIA ops.

2553
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:23,640
They don't work for the CIA.

2554
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:25,960
They're not unwiddling CIA sources.

2555
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,040
And they're not controlled opposition.

2556
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,880
Like sometimes you appear to be.

2557
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:31,240
We are legitimate people who believe

2558
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:31,960
in what we stand for.

2559
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:32,280
That's all I want to say.

2560
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,360
Oh, I'm controlled opposition.

2561
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:36,280
There you are, Alex.

2562
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:37,080
I'm controlled.

2563
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,200
Who gives me my orders?

2564
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:38,760
Please tell me.

2565
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,920
I do believe you're 100% controlled opposition, Alex.

2566
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:45,560
That's why you'll never preach anything

2567
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:48,680
besides peaceful and legal, lawful,

2568
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:51,080
wonderful hunky dory ways of protest.

2569
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:52,680
Okay, so I'm not the one saying

2570
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,280
we got fire teams in the Capitol

2571
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:55,960
and then you guys haven't been indicted

2572
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:57,560
and then they're trying to indict me

2573
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,160
and then you're sitting there

2574
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:01,400
literally saying I'm getting orders

2575
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,440
from a higher level group,

2576
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:03,320
which is not the case.

2577
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:04,520
Look at my eyes.

2578
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,120
I take orders from God.

2579
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:06,520
That's it.

2580
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,160
You understand that?

2581
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,200
You fired the one good man you had

2582
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:11,160
and that was David Knight.

2583
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:14,040
I do believe you were controlled opposition, Alex.

2584
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:14,600
Oh no.

2585
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:16,280
Oh no.

2586
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:25,560
Once again, bad HR decisions

2587
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:28,280
come back to haunt Alex.

2588
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:31,880
Ah, I never thought I'd hear that said in seriousness.

2589
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:34,760
20-year-old Boogaloo boy coming in like,

2590
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:35,800
you're controlled opposition

2591
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,160
because you fired David Knight.

2592
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,480
Oh boy, oh boy.

2593
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:43,480
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

2594
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:45,560
Oh man, if only, if only.

2595
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:48,120
This is the one time where if he had just listened

2596
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,440
to that Stevie P's broadcast,

2597
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:51,720
he could have just been like,

2598
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:54,840
Steve literally said he's been manipulating you

2599
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,120
this entire time.

2600
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:56,440
Yeah.

2601
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:57,960
You're so easy.

2602
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:00,200
Of course you're controlled opposition.

2603
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:02,440
Well, I mean, I don't know.

2604
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,920
I think that the term is loaded.

2605
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:05,960
Oh yeah, yeah, totally.

2606
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:07,560
I wouldn't say that.

2607
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:08,520
I'm saying from his point.

2608
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:09,320
Yeah, yeah.

2609
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:11,720
I think the term controlled opposition is so loaded

2610
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:16,520
because it implies like state control or something.

2611
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,720
And I don't know.

2612
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,400
I don't see compelling evidence

2613
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,240
that Alex is like working for the feds

2614
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:22,440
or something like that.

2615
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:26,120
But he is unreliable opposition.

2616
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:26,620
Yeah.

2617
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,000
Maybe not controlled opposition,

2618
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,560
but he is a persuadable opposition.

2619
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:32,060
Sure.

2620
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,000
He's influenceable by people who play games

2621
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,560
with his ego in particular,

2622
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,040
his sense of self-importance.

2623
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:46,760
Those are things that are real soft spots for him.

2624
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,320
And Steve's such a good example of that.

2625
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:49,960
Yeah.

2626
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:53,720
I would be interested to know if we discover a new thing

2627
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:54,920
that he's so weak to,

2628
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,800
which is being belittled,

2629
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,200
being forced to like,

2630
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,240
do you think this is going to make him have to be like,

2631
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,640
well, fine, I will act more aggressively

2632
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:07,960
in order to look cool to these idiots?

2633
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:08,520
I don't know.

2634
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,600
I mean, you would think that our show

2635
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,480
would be a part of his psychosis.

2636
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:13,960
Yeah, that's true.

2637
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,160
If that were the case.

2638
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:15,880
That's true.

2639
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:18,600
So I've made a career out of belittling him.

2640
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:21,080
He's not trying to impress us.

2641
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:23,160
That's something I was thinking about.

2642
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:23,480
Yeah.

2643
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:26,120
One of the things that's particularly dangerous about this

2644
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,920
or something that makes it more difficult for Alex

2645
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:33,080
is that if he had somebody who was like an Antifa person on,

2646
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:35,800
he could berate them and humiliate them,

2647
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:36,840
hit the pause button.

2648
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:42,840
He can't really do that to somebody who has credibility

2649
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,640
in the right-wing world, in quotes.

2650
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:48,920
Somebody who might have access to an audience

2651
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:52,760
of right-wing people that could like Alex.

2652
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:57,720
Yeah, I mean, it's a weird thing to pop up into my brain,

2653
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,760
but I was just thinking about how in World War II,

2654
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:04,360
one of the big issues with the Japanese command

2655
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:07,160
was that the higher-ups didn't want to lose face

2656
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:09,160
in front of their subordinates.

2657
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:13,160
So the subordinates were driving overall policy

2658
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:17,000
by having this hardcore stance that was imparted upon them

2659
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,160
by the leadership.

2660
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:22,280
And then the leadership realizing that they were fucked

2661
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:25,160
couldn't then say like, okay, we're fucked

2662
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,080
because the subordinates would be like,

2663
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,920
you guys are a bunch of cowards.

2664
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:31,560
So it created this kind of feedback loop

2665
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:34,760
where the more extreme elements were,

2666
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:37,400
even though ostensibly they were under the command

2667
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,360
of someone else,

2668
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:40,840
they were the force that was driving policy at that time.

2669
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:42,600
That sounds like the right win.

2670
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:43,960
Yeah, exactly.

2671
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,760
So Alex has been called controlled opposition

2672
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:48,520
and he did not take kindly to that.

2673
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:51,880
And this is Owen's cue to step in and cool things down.

2674
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:52,440
Sure.

2675
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:56,040
And so he tries to, hey guys.

2676
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:57,320
Hey, we're all friends here.

2677
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:57,640
We all want to end up-

2678
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:59,320
We all want a violent revolution.

2679
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:01,480
We all want to kill all of our enemies.

2680
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:04,760
Look, we want this, but we got to do it later.

2681
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:05,240
Exactly.

2682
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:06,040
That's his whole thing.

2683
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:09,000
I've been arrested for my peaceful protest.

2684
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,680
I'm calling for, we have to awaken 50 million,

2685
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,840
a hundred million, 200 million Americans

2686
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,680
before you can ever even think about doing

2687
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,920
a finger lick of violence in this country

2688
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,200
and have a chance at victory.

2689
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:21,560
That's all I'm saying.

2690
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:22,360
Well, it doesn't matter.

2691
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:23,880
We've done some good radio here

2692
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,320
and had some thought provoking things.

2693
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:25,800
What?

2694
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:26,760
And I'm not going to do cheap-

2695
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:27,880
Of all the things you've done.

2696
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:30,040
You're a well-spoken person and you have,

2697
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,480
I mean, I think you believe what you're saying.

2698
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:34,120
And so we'll continue to watch the situation

2699
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:34,680
as it unfolds.

2700
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:35,480
And I appreciate you coming up here

2701
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:36,760
and defending your ideas.

2702
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:37,640
That's all I can say.

2703
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:40,200
But yeah, it's pretty hilarious.

2704
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:41,560
So I built this whole thing myself.

2705
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,400
I did it with our listeners and I'm so proud

2706
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:44,840
of the fact that I'm independent

2707
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:46,760
and I don't trust people that aren't independent.

2708
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:47,720
And that's what we're all about.

2709
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:48,440
You're mad.

2710
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:51,960
Also, I like the idea that he's saying,

2711
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,400
I'm not going to take cheap shots

2712
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,560
after an hour of cheap shots.

2713
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:56,060
Totally.

2714
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:59,160
I'm personally offended by him saying

2715
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:00,360
that they did great radio.

2716
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:00,760
Oh, great radio.

2717
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:01,720
Personally offended.

2718
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:02,440
Solid radio.

2719
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:03,160
Absolutely.

2720
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:05,400
That is the least true thing either of them

2721
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,680
have said this entire time.

2722
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,440
Well, I will say that as somebody

2723
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,600
who listens to a ton of Infowars,

2724
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:14,600
I think it was at least more interesting than usual.

2725
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:15,720
Okay.

2726
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:17,000
I don't think it's good.

2727
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,400
And I think it's actually really dangerous.

2728
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,320
And I think it's a negative thing.

2729
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:23,080
But in terms of actual content,

2730
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:26,120
looking at it as somebody who's external

2731
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:29,000
and recognizes nefarious motives on both sides,

2732
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:33,960
it is interesting to see the clash of agendas.

2733
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:36,200
Oh, well, listen, Mr. Dunn,

2734
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:38,520
we've done D minus radio today,

2735
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,520
which is way above what we're used to.

2736
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,360
So I think we're going to call this one an interview.

2737
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:43,960
I think that there's a decent chance

2738
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:46,920
you've humiliated me like crazy in front of my audience.

2739
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:47,420
Yeah.

2740
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,280
I don't feel confident at the end of this.

2741
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:52,440
And I probably extended it too long

2742
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:54,040
because I thought I could win in the end.

2743
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,520
And boy, do I hope it drives traffic

2744
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:59,560
because then maybe I'll sell some pills.

2745
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:00,040
Yeah.

2746
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:02,920
So now Mike leaves and Alex,

2747
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:05,560
I guess now is aware of other things

2748
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:07,080
that he should have brought up.

2749
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,440
They talked for an hour.

2750
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,160
And he didn't deny that's his.

2751
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:13,720
So he lied in front of everyone.

2752
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:16,840
He's a disgusting little rat.

2753
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:18,040
What?

2754
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:20,040
And I challenged him to come back on the show tomorrow.

2755
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:21,800
Oh, my God.

2756
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:23,160
Because I meant to get to this

2757
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:24,920
and I forgot about it while it was on.

2758
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:25,560
Yeah. Okay.

2759
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:29,080
So Alex now has other posts and stuff.

2760
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:30,200
I should have brought this up.

2761
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,160
You had a fucking hour.

2762
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:33,720
I forgot to get to it.

2763
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:34,760
I forgot to get to it.

2764
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:38,120
I asked him twice if he's talked to the SPLC.

2765
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:41,080
I had printed out a stack of 30 tweets,

2766
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:42,280
single tweet per page.

2767
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:45,000
And I just forgot to get to all of them.

2768
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,280
I frequently brought up

2769
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:48,360
how he should be killing Bill Gates if he's real.

2770
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:52,040
But I forgot to have my evidence

2771
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:53,800
that he's a dirty little rat.

2772
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:57,000
And now I don't know exactly

2773
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,720
what Alex is even bringing up in that context,

2774
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:01,400
nor do I particularly care.

2775
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:01,720
No.

2776
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:04,600
But I don't necessarily think that Alex is wrong

2777
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:08,040
that he wasn't a totally good faith actor

2778
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:09,000
in his interview.

2779
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:09,320
Totally.

2780
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:11,240
Like, I do think that Mike was being

2781
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:14,040
a little bit disingenuous now.

2782
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,040
Alex is being full disingenuous.

2783
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:18,920
Well, I mean, you can't trust a zealot.

2784
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:21,080
A zealot has every justification

2785
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:24,920
for lying in service of zealotry.

2786
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:26,040
Yeah, absolutely.

2787
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,200
Well, there's one thing you can do with a zealot.

2788
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,120
In fact, I challenge Mike Dunn

2789
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,440
to a bare knuckles boxing match in a ring.

2790
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:33,240
I'm 47.

2791
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:33,880
He's 27.

2792
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:36,760
I mean, he thinks he's so freaking tough all day long.

2793
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:37,240
Let's do it.

2794
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:38,520
Give the money to charity.

2795
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,760
I am so sick of all these wannabe tough guys

2796
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:42,120
running their fat mouths all day

2797
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,320
about how badass they are.

2798
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:49,720
Boy, look, I don't care one way or the other,

2799
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:53,800
but Alex, that dude will murder you.

2800
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:58,200
That dude will absolutely fucking murder you.

2801
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:01,960
All it would take is a little bit of ducking and dodging.

2802
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:04,840
Alex would burn out his cardio so fast

2803
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:06,600
to the point where he couldn't even keep his hands up.

2804
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:09,320
It's hard to fight for a long time.

2805
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:11,720
And by a long time, I mean 30 seconds.

2806
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:13,560
If you're 20 years old and you're boxing

2807
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:16,520
a very much out of shape Alex Jones,

2808
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:19,000
like 47-year-old dude.

2809
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,280
With sleep apnea.

2810
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,040
Yeah, allegedly.

2811
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:22,520
Maybe not.

2812
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,120
Maybe not. Apologies.

2813
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:24,600
Apologies.

2814
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:25,720
But he does have a thick neck.

2815
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:26,120
Yes.

2816
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:27,080
Like, yeah, okay.

2817
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:30,360
You don't want him to connect on the first shot.

2818
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:30,680
No.

2819
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:34,920
But if you duck that, if you dodge the first couple swings he takes,

2820
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:35,800
he's done.

2821
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:36,440
Yeah.

2822
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:39,480
This isn't a four minute 40 situation

2823
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:41,240
where you can still go 10 rounds.

2824
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:44,360
This is a dude who will absolutely destroy you.

2825
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:49,480
It would be satisfying to watch in a perverse way.

2826
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:50,120
Yeah.

2827
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:55,160
So Alex talks to Pete Santilli, who is the guy who got arrested after the

2828
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:57,960
Malheur standoff.

2829
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:03,560
Because he's apparently now an expert on FBI infiltration on stuff.

2830
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:06,920
And so Alex needs to sort of feel better about himself

2831
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:09,560
after getting clowned by this Boogaloo dude.

2832
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:12,680
And afterwards, Alex realizes like,

2833
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:15,080
ah, right, fine, I don't want to box you.

2834
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:18,200
You know, I think Owen's been right since the first hour.

2835
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:22,600
Trying to guide me back to not fight with the Boogaloos and not fight with the Proud

2836
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,360
Boys, which I'm not fighting with any of those groups.

2837
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,720
I love the Proud Boys.

2838
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,320
I agree with a lot of stuff the Boogaloos say.

2839
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:32,280
I just see a fertile ground for the feds to set us up.

2840
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:32,920
And you know what?

2841
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:34,120
Fine, everybody wants a revolution.

2842
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:35,560
You're trying to set him up.

2843
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:37,720
It was all a joke about Mike Dunn in the boxing match.

2844
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:40,920
I saw that stuff with, what's his name?

2845
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:41,720
I've been on the show.

2846
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:44,360
What's it called?

2847
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:44,920
Logan Paul.

2848
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:47,480
Logan Paul and the other Paul guy.

2849
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:49,160
Logan Paul and I forget the other guys.

2850
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:50,600
That's like the biggest news in the country

2851
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:52,040
because they do the boxing matches.

2852
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:52,600
It was a joke.

2853
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:54,760
OK, I don't really want to fight you.

2854
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:57,880
You'd you'd definitely be really embarrassing.

2855
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:58,360
Awful.

2856
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:00,200
I'd be humiliated in front of my heart.

2857
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:00,840
Yeah, probably.

2858
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,200
I'd have at least a black eye.

2859
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:05,800
There's no doubt you'd knock out all of the teeth I've been grinding.

2860
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:07,960
Yeah, yeah, I could use some new teeth.

2861
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:09,880
Uh, hey, look, here's the deal.

2862
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:11,560
Yeah.

2863
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:12,600
Oh, and Owen's right.

2864
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,200
Cooler heads should prevail.

2865
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:20,760
I do think that I see the Boogaloo's as a way for the FBI and the man to set us up.

2866
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:25,480
Now, granted, I've been spending weeks on my show using them as a fall guy

2867
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:28,920
for the storming of the Capitol, which is kind of the same thing.

2868
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:33,640
I literally tried to get one to commit to a target on my air.

2869
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:37,080
I tried to make him incriminate himself.

2870
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:43,000
I implied heavily and repeatedly that he works for the globalist secretly.

2871
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:43,800
Yeah.

2872
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:44,680
I failed.

2873
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:46,360
And I guess we'll be friends now.

2874
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:49,400
So embarrassing.

2875
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:57,000
What an, like, just ineffective, bad, like, there's nothing good that can come of this.

2876
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:01,240
I don't even know what Alex expected in terms of, like, a positive outcome from this.

2877
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:07,080
Although I do think it's really, really funny that Alex is doing this like,

2878
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:10,040
eh, I guess calmer heads got to prevail and we got to be friends with these people

2879
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:13,000
that I have already said are awful.

2880
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,600
And, wow, the intro music that's playing is The Doors.

2881
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:18,760
Don't play with me because you're playing with fire.

2882
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:20,200
I hate everyone.

2883
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:21,720
I hate everyone.

2884
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:22,600
There's an intern.

2885
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:24,280
There's an intern who knows what's up.

2886
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:25,480
Oh, it's got to be.

2887
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:26,120
For sure.

2888
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:27,800
Thematically, that is really funny.

2889
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:29,000
Too on the nose.

2890
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:29,320
Yeah.

2891
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:29,880
Yeah.

2892
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:34,200
So, like I said, this is sort of going to be a two-parter into Monday.

2893
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:34,520
Right.

2894
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:40,600
And one of the reasons is because I do know that at least someone from The Boogaloo Folk

2895
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:43,400
was on the show on Thursday.

2896
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:43,800
All right.

2897
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:48,360
I did not have enough time before we needed to record in order to get that already for

2898
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:50,840
Friday's episode, but that will be on Monday.

2899
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:55,640
So, we'll be back on Monday for part two of this.

2900
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:59,400
I haven't come up with a good pun, like the Caravanity Project.

2901
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:00,440
That's trouble.

2902
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:03,640
But trust me, by Monday, I will have a great pun.

2903
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:08,040
Was there a Breakin' Three?

2904
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:10,120
Let's find out.

2905
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:11,560
Yeah, that's a good question.

2906
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:12,040
I don't know.

2907
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:15,320
Breakin' Three.

2908
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:18,440
Rubber Boogaloo.

2909
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:20,600
I don't know.

2910
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:22,760
Breaking Bad season three.

2911
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:23,080
All right.

2912
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:24,360
Breaking Bad season three.

2913
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:25,320
I like that one.

2914
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:25,720
Monday.

2915
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:27,240
Breaking Bad season three.

2916
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:33,800
We're having a great time.

2917
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:36,520
Yeah, I'll come up with a better pun.

2918
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:37,020
Nope.

2919
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:38,300
Blackjack.

2920
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:40,040
There was no date.

2921
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:41,080
Ah, shit.

2922
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:43,160
Yeah, you're gonna get this game one of these days.

2923
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:43,880
Someday.

2924
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:50,040
So, I think that there's some fun to be had by listening to this in terms of seeing somebody

2925
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:54,680
mirror a lot of Alex's shit back to him in a way that Alex can't really deal with,

2926
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:56,280
can't really respond to.

2927
01:45:56,280 --> 01:46:02,440
It's funny to hear him say, hey, you're probably controlled opposition, which also

2928
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:07,880
implies that he thought that at the beginning of the interview, which is weird.

2929
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:11,560
Why even go if you think he's controlled opposition?

2930
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:12,040
I don't know.

2931
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:15,480
Or why not make that the thing you bring up first?

2932
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:22,840
I think because if he brought that up first, he wouldn't get the chance to defend Boogalooing.

2933
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:27,320
It would immediately become like, I'm not controlled opposition, here's all the blah, blah, blah.

2934
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:28,120
That's probably true.

2935
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:32,360
And it does give a bit of a coloring to the beginning of the interview.

2936
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:32,760
Totally.

2937
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:40,040
Where the poise that he's showing or the kind of lack of concern with the way Alex is portraying

2938
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:44,040
him may come from a place of like, I don't even believe you're real.

2939
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:48,520
Yeah, I mean, it could also definitely come from a place where, I mean, obviously he had

2940
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:50,120
quotes from Alex.

2941
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:52,040
It could come from a place of preparation.

2942
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:57,000
If you believe that you're going on a show that's controlled opposition, I imagine you'd

2943
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:01,480
be like, okay, then I have to find a way to defeat that.

2944
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:03,640
Otherwise there's no point in going on the show.

2945
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:05,720
Or failing defeating that.

2946
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:07,080
Yeah, exploiting it.

2947
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:12,600
Existing that place in a way that I can achieve my goals while not falling into the traps

2948
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:13,960
that will be set for me.

2949
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:15,960
Like, hey, do you work for the SPLC?

2950
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:16,680
Absolutely.

2951
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:17,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2952
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:18,920
And I think that he did that.

2953
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:21,880
And I actually think that that's why this is dangerous.

2954
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:27,400
Because I think that Mike successfully navigated the terrain of Alex Jones' shitty interview

2955
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:35,880
style and was given a place where he could appear to be the person who lives Alex Jones'

2956
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:36,360
ideals.

2957
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:42,600
And I would not be surprised if that was not an effective recruitment tool to anybody listening

2958
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43,400
to Alex's show.

2959
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:44,280
And that's bad.

2960
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:49,960
And Alex should recognize, intentional or not, that is the effect that this sort of

2961
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:50,440
thing has.

2962
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:51,640
Thanks, okay.

2963
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:54,280
The Boogaloo's should pay Alex for this, quite frankly.

2964
01:47:55,320 --> 01:48:03,400
Well, and then there's just that known psychological exploit in humanity where he sounds so confident.

2965
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:07,480
He sounds like a true believer.

2966
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:15,560
And he's laying out stuff in a way where you're like, I guess revolution has to happen somewhere.

2967
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:17,080
And Alex can't refute that.

2968
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:17,480
Exactly.

2969
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:18,760
He can't disagree with it.

2970
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,840
Owen's best thing is like, well, later.

2971
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:22,280
Later, yeah, great.

2972
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:23,400
That's a dumb argument.

2973
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:23,900
Yep.

2974
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:24,860
Yeah.

2975
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:33,080
And you have it in opposition to or in juxtaposition with this guy who he's saying, I used to look

2976
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:33,640
up to you.

2977
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:34,680
You were my hero.

2978
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:41,320
The Alex Jones that I grew up listening to, creating that differentiation between the

2979
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:45,880
Alex Jones I grew up listening to and this person I'm talking to, who is Alex Jones in

2980
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:47,560
the present, is damning.

2981
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:48,600
Like, it's...

2982
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:51,800
No, it's hard to...

2983
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:53,000
He got clowned.

2984
01:48:53,000 --> 01:49:00,840
It's hard not to look at that like 23 and under generation and not see people who were

2985
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:03,160
birthed in the misinformation age.

2986
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:05,640
You know, like we lived through it.

2987
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,520
They were born of it, you know?

2988
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:10,600
So that ability to have that...

2989
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:12,280
High speed misinformation.

2990
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:12,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2991
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:15,640
His misinformation was still going around in newsletters when we were kids.

2992
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:21,960
Totally, but like the information era we live in, like they're not going to be cowed by

2993
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:22,760
old media.

2994
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:23,720
It's just not going to happen.

2995
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:26,360
And Alex's old media.

2996
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:27,080
Exactly.

2997
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:29,880
Anyway, we'll see what happens on the Thursday show.

2998
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:33,480
Will the bare knuckle boxing match that has been canceled happen?

2999
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:35,880
Wait for Breaking Bad season three to find out.

3000
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:37,000
Yes, we'll be back.

3001
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,200
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

3002
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:38,840
We do have a website.

3003
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:39,880
It's knowledgefight.com.

3004
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:40,760
We're also on Twitter.

3005
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:41,320
We are on Twitter.

3006
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:42,280
It's at knowledgefight.com.

3007
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:43,080
Now go to Betjordan.

3008
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:43,560
Or Facebook.

3009
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:46,520
We are on Facebook.

3010
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:50,600
And if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

3011
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:51,400
doing God's work.

3012
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:51,960
Yeah, we'll be back.

3013
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:53,000
But until then, I'm Neo.

3014
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:53,480
I'm Leo.

3015
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:54,520
I'm DZX Clark.

3016
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:56,520
Daryl Rundis.

3017
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:59,800
I sometimes forget that I'm Daryl Rundis.

3018
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:01,320
Andy in Kansas.

3019
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:01,800
You're on the air.

3020
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:02,440
Thanks for holding.

3021
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:05,080
Hello, Alex.

3022
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:06,040
I'm a first time caller.

3023
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:06,840
I'm a huge fan.

3024
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:07,640
I love your work.

3025
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:16,920
I love you.
