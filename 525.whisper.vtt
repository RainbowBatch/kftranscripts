00:00.000 --> 00:12.880
N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.880 --> 00:19.520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.360
I have great respect for knowledgefight.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.360
Knowledgefight.

00:25.360 --> 00:29.280
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.280 --> 00:46.960
I am sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys saying

00:46.960 --> 00:58.320
we are the bad guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.320
I love you.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.320
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.320
I'm Jordan.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.640
We're couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about

01:04.640 --> 01:05.640
Alex Jones.

01:05.640 --> 01:06.640
Oh indeed, we are Dan.

01:06.640 --> 01:07.640
Jordan!

01:07.640 --> 01:08.640
Dan!

01:08.640 --> 01:09.640
Jordan!

01:09.640 --> 01:10.640
Quick question for you.

01:10.640 --> 01:11.640
What's up?

01:11.640 --> 01:12.640
What's your bright spot today?

01:12.640 --> 01:16.540
My bright spot today, Jordan, was getting to join you on your debut stream of your video

01:16.540 --> 01:18.320
game channel over on Twitch.

01:18.320 --> 01:19.320
Indeed.

01:19.320 --> 01:24.040
You started playing Final Fantasy VII, it was a lot of fun to sit in and have very little

01:24.040 --> 01:26.040
to say.

01:26.040 --> 01:32.720
You are very offended when you do not have a sincere and large body of research from

01:32.720 --> 01:33.720
which to call upon.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.160
It's a challenge for me to care.

01:36.160 --> 01:40.400
Ah yes, there we go.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.400
And I, look, you know.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.320
I like you judging other people for caring.

01:43.320 --> 01:48.480
I'm not judging you, I'm happy for you and I fully support you in this and all your endeavors.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.480
I know.

01:49.480 --> 01:53.080
I just can't care about watching this stupid video game.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.600
I understand completely.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.600
I understand completely.

01:55.600 --> 02:00.080
I also don't like it being exposed that I probably didn't beat the game, though I thought

02:00.080 --> 02:02.680
I did.

02:02.680 --> 02:03.680
You came close enough.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.680
Oh god.

02:04.680 --> 02:07.000
But yeah, it's really fun.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.920
I'm happy for you and congratulate you on the launching of your side project there.

02:12.920 --> 02:13.920
Yeah!

02:13.920 --> 02:18.620
It was very enjoyable and everybody really had a good time and you were absolutely great.

02:18.620 --> 02:22.520
How dare you act like you were, oh I was so terrible.

02:22.520 --> 02:23.520
We had a grand old time.

02:23.520 --> 02:28.320
I wasn't saying I was so terrible, I said I was so bored.

02:28.320 --> 02:29.320
I will keep my mouth shut.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.320
Slight semantic difference.

02:30.320 --> 02:31.320
Retracted.

02:31.320 --> 02:32.320
Retracted, sir.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.400
How about you?

02:34.400 --> 02:38.600
My bright spot, Dan, is today my partner is getting her vaccine.

02:38.600 --> 02:39.600
That's great.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.600
Yeah!

02:40.600 --> 02:44.200
She's a teacher, she didn't even have to try and cheat her way in or lie to anybody.

02:44.200 --> 02:48.160
She's getting her vaccine at the right time and I'm really happy for her.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.160
That's fantastic.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.160
Congratulations.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.160
Yeah, I'm very stoked.

02:51.160 --> 02:55.880
I hope that the roll out continues and intensifies.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.600
In at least May or June I'll be able to get it.

02:58.600 --> 02:59.600
2022.

02:59.600 --> 03:00.600
Yeah, absolutely.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.800
Once they get around to podcasters.

03:02.800 --> 03:03.800
Probably low on the list.

03:03.800 --> 03:08.480
Yeah, she'll gladly watch me slowly fade away, I think that'll be...

03:08.480 --> 03:16.120
Your partner is a teacher, like you said, so obviously there's much need for folks in

03:16.120 --> 03:18.360
that line, much less so podcasters.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.360
Very...

03:19.360 --> 03:26.160
So yeah, Jordan, I'm glad for that, and I wish you the best on your new exploration

03:26.160 --> 03:27.160
of Midgar.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.960
I'm gonna remember the name now.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.180
That's true, you will remember Midgar.

03:31.180 --> 03:34.560
So Jordan, today we got an interesting thing to talk about.

03:34.560 --> 03:35.560
Oh yeah?

03:35.560 --> 03:36.560
Interesting episode.

03:36.560 --> 03:37.560
What's that?

03:37.560 --> 03:39.560
We're gonna be talking about January 27th, 2021, Blackjack.

03:39.560 --> 03:42.000
Ah, shit, you're so good.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
So fast.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.400
We're on the 27th, this is Wednesday of this week, and the reason that we are sort of jumping

03:48.400 --> 03:53.080
ahead in time, our last episode was about the inauguration and Harrison Smith being

03:53.080 --> 03:54.080
a...

03:54.080 --> 03:55.080
Blatant bigot.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.080
Yeah.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.080
Yeah.

03:57.080 --> 04:02.480
And the reason is, hey, I'm Alex Jones, I'm sitting around, I'm thinking, the devil just

04:02.480 --> 04:03.800
got into the White House.

04:03.800 --> 04:04.800
Sure.

04:04.800 --> 04:09.040
The Texas Supreme Court has just ruled that I can be sued by the Sandy Hook families.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.040
Problem.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.000
I'm gonna go on vacation, man.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Smart move.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.520
So Alex just leaves for Utah, which is a strange place to go, but whatever.

04:18.520 --> 04:23.040
I like that the only time, every time he threatens a vacation, he never takes it.

04:23.040 --> 04:27.240
The only time he does take a vacation is when his lawyers have clearly said, if you are

04:27.240 --> 04:30.160
on the air, you will say something that hurts our case.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.520
You need to chill.

04:31.520 --> 04:32.840
Yeah, you gotta go away.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.680
You gotta go to fucking Utah.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.680
You gotta be in Utah right now.

04:36.680 --> 04:39.600
Go see the Jazz, Rudy Gobert's having a great season.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.800
Yeah, I don't know what he's doing in Utah, it doesn't seem like, I mean, nothing against

04:42.800 --> 04:43.800
Utah, I've been there.

04:43.800 --> 04:44.800
It's a nice state.

04:44.800 --> 04:45.800
Yeah.

04:45.800 --> 04:46.800
I like the Southwest quite a bit.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.000
Eh, it's pretty.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Yeah.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.280
So, I retract that.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.520
It is a good place to go on vacation.

04:51.520 --> 04:52.520
Yeah, it's a great place.

04:52.520 --> 04:53.520
Whatever.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.520
It just seems strange.

04:54.520 --> 04:58.160
Well, I mean, you know, too many places are dry, I suppose is the only argument I have.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.160
There's a dry Salt Lake.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.360
Oh, you mean too many places in Utah?

05:01.360 --> 05:02.360
Yeah, yeah.

05:02.360 --> 05:03.360
Oh, yes, yes.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.360
Are alcohol-free.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.360
Oh, that too.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.360
Yes.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.360
A lot of dry counties.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.360
Yeah, a lot of dry counties.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.360
I thought you meant it's arid there.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.360
No.

05:10.360 --> 05:11.680
No, I did not mean that.

05:11.680 --> 05:16.920
So, yeah, Alex was out of studio and Owen Schroyer was hosting for a number of days

05:16.920 --> 05:19.200
and I just don't care.

05:19.200 --> 05:23.840
And so, I was considering maybe, like, let's check in and just do a Harrison Smith episode.

05:23.840 --> 05:24.840
Sure.

05:24.840 --> 05:29.840
But then, Wednesday, Alex hosted a good bit of his own show with Owen Schroyer riding

05:29.840 --> 05:35.440
shotgun in the studio and something happened that requires our attention.

05:35.440 --> 05:40.840
So we will be talking about that today and honestly, I think that there might be a sequel

05:40.840 --> 05:48.400
to this on Monday's episode of our show because this appears to be something that might...

05:48.400 --> 05:52.760
I am going to fight a bear on Friday this week.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.600
Take away the bear.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.080
We've got a charity boxing challenge?

05:57.080 --> 05:58.080
Take away...

05:58.080 --> 05:59.080
Yep, we do.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.080
We've got a charity boxing challenge.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.080
There will be a bear knuckle boxing match.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.080
Okay, there we go.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.080
Challenged.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.400
How do I just guess these things, Dan?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.400
I don't know.

06:07.400 --> 06:12.000
There will be a bear knuckle boxing match challenged and then retracted at the end of

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
this episode.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Okay.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Okay.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Alright, spoiler alert.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
That's too soon.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
That's too soon.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.520
But there is a feeling that I have, I mean, we're recording this on Thursday and I have

06:22.520 --> 06:27.560
some awareness of what happened on his show today, but I think that this is a narrative

06:27.560 --> 06:28.560
that's continuing.

06:28.560 --> 06:32.440
There's something that's going to continue into Monday's show without giving too much

06:32.440 --> 06:33.440
away.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.080
Everybody who's listening already fucking knows what I'm talking about.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.080
Of course.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.800
So let's take a little moment before we get down to business, Jordan, to say thank you

06:38.800 --> 06:40.400
to some folks who signed up and are supporting the show.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.520
Oh, that's a great idea.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.760
So first, Dr. Bingo, like Van Gogh.

06:44.760 --> 06:45.760
Thank you so much.

06:45.760 --> 06:46.760
You are now a policy wonk.

06:46.760 --> 06:47.760
I'm a policy wonk.

06:47.760 --> 06:48.760
Thank you.

06:48.760 --> 06:49.760
Dr. Bingo.

06:49.760 --> 06:50.760
Thank you very much, Dr. Bingo.

06:50.760 --> 06:51.760
Like Van Gogh.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.760
Next, Brunisinde.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.760
Thank you so much.

06:53.760 --> 06:54.760
You are now a policy wonk.

06:54.760 --> 06:55.760
I'm a policy wonk.

06:55.760 --> 06:56.760
Thank you.

06:56.760 --> 06:57.760
Hey, thank you very much.

06:57.760 --> 06:58.760
Next, I love you.

06:58.760 --> 06:59.760
Thank you so much.

06:59.760 --> 07:00.760
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:00.760 --> 07:01.760
I love you.

07:01.760 --> 07:02.760
Thank you so much.

07:02.760 --> 07:03.760
You are now a policy wonk.

07:03.760 --> 07:04.760
I'm a policy wonk.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.560
Thank you very much.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.940
You are now a policy wonk.

07:07.940 --> 07:08.940
I'm a policy wonk.

07:08.940 --> 07:10.480
Thank you, Chad Rice.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.480
Thank you.

07:11.480 --> 07:12.480
Next, Leeland.

07:12.480 --> 07:13.480
Thank you so much.

07:13.480 --> 07:14.480
You are now a policy wonk.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.480
I'm a policy wonk.

07:15.480 --> 07:16.480
Thank you very much.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.420
My favorite of the Stamper clan.

07:18.420 --> 07:19.420
Ooh.

07:19.420 --> 07:20.420
Yeah.

07:20.420 --> 07:23.640
Next, Davron from Sweden who loves your podcast.

07:23.640 --> 07:24.640
Thank you so much.

07:24.640 --> 07:25.640
You're now a policy wonk.

07:25.640 --> 07:26.640
I'm a policy wonk.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.840
Thank you very much, Davron from Sweden.

07:28.840 --> 07:32.600
And then finally, thank you so much, Trump, the tiny hands of fate.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.040
You are now a policy wonk.

07:34.040 --> 07:35.320
I'm a policy wonk.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.080
That's a little Mystery Science Theater reference.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.160
Yes, yes, absolutely.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.480
To go along with your-

07:39.480 --> 07:41.480
Trump, the hands of fate.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.360
The tiny hands of fate.

07:43.360 --> 07:47.400
That's to go along as another plug for your Twitch channel.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.240
Great, great.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.840
Where you have a Mystery Science Theater cut out.

07:49.840 --> 07:52.240
I'm already embarrassed.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.080
That's the goal.

07:53.080 --> 07:56.080
Doing something is a terrible idea, Dan, that's the lesson.

07:56.080 --> 07:56.920
That's the goal.

07:56.920 --> 08:00.000
I'm trying to smother you with embarrassment.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.320
So Jordan, we started off today on the 27th.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.960
Like I said, this is all going to be on the 27th.

08:03.960 --> 08:04.800
Yes.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.080
And Alex opens up the show and he teases

08:08.080 --> 08:10.000
what will end up being the reason

08:10.000 --> 08:11.160
we need to do this episode.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.000
Gotcha.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.960
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:13.960 --> 08:17.800
thank you for joining us on this January 27th,

08:17.800 --> 08:20.160
2021 Wednesday broadcast.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.000
Blackjack.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.920
I am your host, Alex Jones,

08:22.920 --> 08:27.920
and we are going to have the founder of the Boogaloo Boys

08:28.080 --> 08:28.920
joining us. Interesting.

08:28.920 --> 08:31.800
Coming up on the broadcast today.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.320
That is in the second hour.

08:33.320 --> 08:36.920
I appreciate Mr. Dunn coming on after I've said

08:36.920 --> 08:40.040
some critical things of his group.

08:40.040 --> 08:41.400
He says to set the record straight.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.960
So I look forward to that because who's going to know more

08:43.960 --> 08:47.120
about the Boogaloo's than the founder of the Boogaloo's.

08:47.120 --> 08:51.960
He is not the founder or the leader of the first thing that

08:51.960 --> 08:54.880
Mike Dunn does when he gets on the show is correct Alex

08:54.880 --> 08:55.720
about this.

08:55.720 --> 08:59.960
Alex is trying to present him as like the head of these,

08:59.960 --> 09:01.680
the Boogaloo's.

09:01.680 --> 09:05.200
And I wrote down founder of the Boogaloo boys and then put

09:05.200 --> 09:07.440
giant scare quotes around founder.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.280
Yeah.

09:08.280 --> 09:09.120
Yeah.

09:09.120 --> 09:13.200
This is something that's a little bit murky.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.440
I don't think this is a good idea for Alex.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.400
You'll see why.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.600
Cause he agrees with them on everything exactly like he did

09:20.600 --> 09:21.440
with David Duke.

09:21.440 --> 09:26.120
And this guy is a 20 year old who is really,

09:27.600 --> 09:30.720
I would say he is more consistent than Alex.

09:30.720 --> 09:31.560
Oh, that's not good.

09:31.560 --> 09:35.200
And that makes it really tough to argue when you're Alex.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.040
And that ends up becoming very embarrassing.

09:38.040 --> 09:42.280
I would say that we have not talked as much about the

09:42.280 --> 09:46.360
Boogaloo boys on this podcast because it doesn't intersect

09:46.360 --> 09:48.800
with Alex as much as one might think.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.960
Alex leaves them alone for the most part,

09:51.960 --> 09:55.760
except a couple of times he's tried to use them to scapegoat

09:55.760 --> 09:59.440
things that right wing militias have done.

09:59.440 --> 10:03.280
And the situation with the Capitol on the 6th,

10:03.280 --> 10:08.280
January 6th is so large and so important that it's led to a

10:08.680 --> 10:11.680
critical mass of throwing them under the bus and blaming

10:11.680 --> 10:12.520
them.

10:12.520 --> 10:16.160
So his beloved oath keepers and such don't come under

10:16.160 --> 10:17.000
attention.

10:17.000 --> 10:17.840
Right.

10:17.840 --> 10:18.680
Yeah.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.920
He wouldn't do too much to, I guess,

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
point out the people who are basically he's running

10:27.000 --> 10:30.600
stochastic terrorism for, you know, like he's,

10:30.600 --> 10:33.440
he's the one who's both giving them that cover of like,

10:33.440 --> 10:36.320
these guys aren't part of what we believe in while at the

10:36.320 --> 10:38.320
same time, stoking their rage.

10:38.320 --> 10:41.360
So you don't want to be also like Boogaloo boys,

10:41.360 --> 10:42.760
let's pay attention to them.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.520
Sure. It would be unwise.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.560
And it's complicated for him too,

10:46.560 --> 10:51.560
because there is a lack of uniformity with a lot of the

10:52.160 --> 10:53.360
Boogaloo communities.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.200
Right.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.440
There is an embracing of Antifa sometimes even,

10:57.440 --> 11:01.680
and black lives matter, or at least a loose accelerationism

11:01.680 --> 11:04.440
being the goal, regardless of ideology behind it.

11:04.440 --> 11:09.280
Yes. Perhaps some would say a potentially performative

11:09.280 --> 11:14.080
collaboration and an acceptance of those left wing sort of

11:14.080 --> 11:15.000
groups.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.600
And that would be really difficult for Alex to explain to

11:17.600 --> 11:18.440
his audience.

11:18.440 --> 11:23.440
He's made such a sort of market off of globalist,

11:23.440 --> 11:26.720
devil bad, Alex, Patriot, God, good.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.560
Yeah. You know?

11:27.560 --> 11:31.040
And I don't think that he'd be able to have his audience

11:31.040 --> 11:33.200
understand the idea.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.260
They're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:34.260 --> 11:37.000
They're going there because they want to antagonize.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:38.200 --> 11:41.840
But also that they're trying to bring some people in there.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.800
I know I've called them all demons,

11:43.800 --> 11:45.920
but they're trying to bring in the accelerationists who I

11:45.920 --> 11:46.760
guess are good now.

11:46.760 --> 11:47.600
I don't know.

11:47.600 --> 11:48.600
I don't know.

11:48.600 --> 11:53.400
I've gotten some messages in the past from folks who,

11:53.400 --> 11:56.080
or into boogaloo stuff.

11:56.080 --> 12:00.800
And they implore me to understand that, you know,

12:00.800 --> 12:03.400
it's about guns and gun rights.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.240
Sure.

12:04.240 --> 12:09.240
And the feeling that I have that I come around on it is I'm

12:09.600 --> 12:14.360
not going to judge any individual based on their liking to

12:14.360 --> 12:17.040
wear Hawaiian shirts and protest for the second amendment.

12:17.040 --> 12:17.880
Sure.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.760
But I'm also not going to trust them.

12:19.760 --> 12:20.600
Yes.

12:20.600 --> 12:24.120
If they associate themselves with a group like this.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.280
And part of the reason for that is there have been enough

12:27.280 --> 12:31.560
instances in the past of people who associate with boogaloo,

12:31.560 --> 12:34.840
iconography, ideas, the movement,

12:34.840 --> 12:39.840
doing things that are meant to accelerationist protests.

12:41.320 --> 12:44.800
You know, make, who was that guy,

12:44.800 --> 12:49.080
that sergeant who shot a cop and then wrote

12:49.080 --> 12:50.800
a book and blood on his car.

12:50.800 --> 12:51.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:51.800 --> 12:55.200
He was talking prior to this about using left-wing protests,

12:55.200 --> 12:58.640
using the energy of it in their anger for their purposes.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.360
There's been enough instances of that.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.960
There's been all that discussion.

13:02.960 --> 13:07.480
And then let's just deal with the fact that boogaloo is a

13:07.480 --> 13:10.960
reference to electric boogaloo break into,

13:10.960 --> 13:11.960
which is like,

13:11.960 --> 13:16.000
it was a meme back in 2012 about a second civil war.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Right.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.200
The whole organizing central thing is a joke,

13:21.200 --> 13:23.080
quote unquote joke about,

13:23.080 --> 13:25.080
all right, we're going to have to have a second civil war.

13:25.080 --> 13:25.920
Right.

13:25.920 --> 13:28.920
Boogaloo is from electric boogaloo,

13:28.920 --> 13:31.400
civil war to electric boogaloo.

13:31.400 --> 13:35.520
If you are someone who just cares about people's liberty and

13:35.520 --> 13:37.600
rights and second amendment,

13:37.600 --> 13:40.600
and you also like to be goofy and wear a Hawaiian shirt,

13:40.600 --> 13:43.600
I would implore you to not be associated with the group

13:43.600 --> 13:46.560
that's name is derived from a joke about how we need a

13:46.560 --> 13:47.560
second civil war.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.400
That would be wise.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.960
And has spawned a bunch of incredibly malevolent actors.

13:51.960 --> 13:55.000
There's nothing about this Hawaiian shirt that's intrinsic

13:55.000 --> 13:59.320
to the thing that they seem to want to push for.

13:59.320 --> 14:00.160
Yeah.

14:00.160 --> 14:02.240
There's nothing, it just, I don't know.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.120
It seems like a bridge too far.

14:05.120 --> 14:09.000
I just can't imagine being in 2021 and taking anybody at

14:09.000 --> 14:13.280
face value who says anything similar to that.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.600
It's 2021 guys.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.640
We don't take them at face value anymore.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.160
Maybe you're a good person.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.640
I know plenty of good people who are second amendment

14:20.640 --> 14:22.320
people, tons of them.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.040
But if I took any of them at face value,

14:25.040 --> 14:26.600
I would be an insane person.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.760
That's simply not a thing that we get to do anymore with

14:29.760 --> 14:30.760
second amendment people.

14:30.760 --> 14:35.760
I would bet that there are many individuals who consider

14:36.440 --> 14:40.360
themselves part of the oath keepers that are decent,

14:40.360 --> 14:45.360
family, caring, considerate people that aren't the type

14:46.400 --> 14:47.760
that would have a napalm bomb.

14:47.760 --> 14:48.920
Right. Right.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.800
But. Napalm bombs, still rare.

14:51.800 --> 14:52.960
True.

14:52.960 --> 14:56.880
That said, even if that individual I could see as possibly

14:56.880 --> 14:59.200
a decent person and I could probably get along with.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.040
Sure.

15:00.040 --> 15:03.880
I would not align myself with them politically.

15:03.880 --> 15:04.720
Right.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.480
Were I to know that they were associated

15:06.480 --> 15:07.320
with the oath keepers.

15:07.320 --> 15:08.160
Totally.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.640
Because that's a deal breaker.

15:09.640 --> 15:14.640
And I feel the same way largely about the Boogaloo stuff.

15:14.720 --> 15:15.560
Yeah.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.880
No, I just background check everybody I meet anymore now.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.680
Just go back through their Twitter feed.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.680
Just going back through the ah, ah, ah.

15:21.680 --> 15:22.520
Nah, nah, nah.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.280
You're not a face value second amendment guy.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.760
Ah, I caught ya.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.360
I don't believe anything.

15:27.360 --> 15:31.840
So Alex does not want a violent revolution.

15:31.840 --> 15:32.880
Sure.

15:32.880 --> 15:37.480
But he is against the Boogaloo folks, which makes sense.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.680
I mean, they kind of are gearing towards

15:39.680 --> 15:42.080
like the inevitability of a second.

15:42.080 --> 15:43.560
But it's kind of what Alex said.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.280
He's, he's makes no sense.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.120
Okay.

15:46.120 --> 15:46.960
Those of you out there that are like,

15:46.960 --> 15:49.680
oh, let's just have a violent revolution.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.240
You're always the ones that are asking somebody else to do it.

15:54.240 --> 15:57.720
You're always the ones asking somebody else to do it.

15:57.720 --> 15:58.720
You know, take the Boogaloos.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.240
They've said, and I'm gonna ask them about this,

16:01.240 --> 16:03.040
that they want to have an armed march

16:03.040 --> 16:05.480
the weekend after the sixth.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.720
But if you have an armed march in DC,

16:06.720 --> 16:07.760
they'll arrest you for that.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.240
You can say, well, it's my second amendment.

16:09.240 --> 16:10.480
They'll still arrest you.

16:11.480 --> 16:15.200
And so then we didn't see the Boogaloos show up armed.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.400
Were they hoping other people would?

16:16.400 --> 16:18.120
I don't know.

16:18.120 --> 16:18.960
I just don't like this thing

16:18.960 --> 16:20.880
of let's have violent revolution.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.960
And then people say, okay, well you go first.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.760
Well, I'm not going first and.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.520
There's so much in that clip there

16:27.520 --> 16:30.400
that just contradicts Alex's entire branding.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.240
Yeah.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.440
He's saying that he isn't gonna go first,

16:32.440 --> 16:34.400
but he also spent so much of his time on his show

16:34.400 --> 16:36.000
yelling about how he's the tip of the spear.

16:36.000 --> 16:36.840
The spear.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.520
And Infowars is the thing that it's at the front.

16:38.520 --> 16:39.960
It hits the barbed wire to make sure

16:39.960 --> 16:41.680
it's safe for everyone else to charge.

16:41.680 --> 16:42.520
Absolutely.

16:42.520 --> 16:43.760
If you listened to Alex's show

16:43.760 --> 16:45.160
and believed a word of what he said,

16:45.160 --> 16:46.720
you might be surprised to hear him say

16:46.720 --> 16:48.920
he doesn't want to be at the front.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.280
Also, Alex's opposition to the Boogaloo idea

16:51.280 --> 16:53.280
of having armed marches makes no sense.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.120
None.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.600
Alex is a gun rights absolutist.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.000
And in the past, he's been pretty clear

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
that every American has the right to carry arms

16:59.000 --> 17:01.680
peacefully and responsibly at protests.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.520
The idea that a certain group is being told

17:03.520 --> 17:05.320
that they'll be arrested if they march armed

17:05.320 --> 17:07.200
should be a huge violation of his concept

17:07.200 --> 17:08.120
of the Second Amendment,

17:08.120 --> 17:10.200
and yet here he is saying that the Boogaloo type

17:10.200 --> 17:13.920
shouldn't march armed because the state told them not to?

17:13.920 --> 17:15.400
This is where it's important to recognize

17:15.400 --> 17:17.520
that Alex has no real concrete principles

17:17.520 --> 17:18.680
that he's working off of,

17:18.680 --> 17:21.640
or else his position here would have to be different.

17:21.640 --> 17:22.920
He doesn't have a principled belief

17:22.920 --> 17:24.040
in the right to gun ownership.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.520
He just likes shooting guns a lot,

17:25.520 --> 17:27.400
and he found that it was a really marketable niche

17:27.400 --> 17:29.080
to be a guy who yells vague threats

17:29.080 --> 17:31.360
towards anyone who indicates support for gun regulation.

17:31.360 --> 17:32.200
True.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.200
At the moment, business requires that he actually

17:34.200 --> 17:37.600
be in favor of people he would normally call gun grabbers,

17:37.600 --> 17:39.400
and somehow this doesn't seem weird

17:39.400 --> 17:41.160
to a large portion of his audience.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.160
Yeah, I mean, when your ideology is,

17:44.160 --> 17:47.920
er, money, and your strategy is scramble

17:47.920 --> 17:49.880
every time something weird happens,

17:49.880 --> 17:51.080
then yeah, you're gonna get into

17:51.080 --> 17:54.000
some real uncomfortable situations.

17:54.000 --> 17:54.920
It does appear that way.

17:54.920 --> 17:55.760
Yeah.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.160
Someone else who's in an uncomfortable situation

17:57.160 --> 17:59.400
is old Donald J. Trump.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.240
Oh.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.520
He's got his impeachment trial coming up.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.360
Sure.

18:02.360 --> 18:03.960
And Alex has a pretty good idea.

18:03.960 --> 18:04.800
I believe.

18:04.800 --> 18:05.640
Of what he needs to do.

18:05.640 --> 18:06.480
Okay.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.080
He's lost over 60 other platforms,

18:08.080 --> 18:11.400
so he can be silenced, listen to this,

18:11.400 --> 18:14.360
silenced ahead of and during his trial.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.520
And it guarantees they're saying,

18:16.520 --> 18:18.880
oh, let the president's lawyers put on the defense.

18:18.880 --> 18:19.720
No.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.120
Put Trump in there.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.480
Put Trump in there on the witness seat

18:25.480 --> 18:27.720
and let them attack him and lie about him,

18:27.720 --> 18:31.000
and all he's gotta do is have a hit list of exhibits

18:31.000 --> 18:32.440
after they attack him that he puts on,

18:32.440 --> 18:37.000
and it will destroy them right out of a Perry Mason movie.

18:37.000 --> 18:37.840
Yeah, that's right.

18:37.840 --> 18:38.680
Get Trump up there.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.560
Just putting the whole system on trial.

18:40.560 --> 18:41.400
Yes, please.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.440
Yes, please.

18:42.440 --> 18:43.360
I would like that.

18:43.360 --> 18:44.800
Please take that advice.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.760
That is something that I would,

18:46.760 --> 18:47.880
that would be the first time

18:47.880 --> 18:50.760
that I have ever watched an entire speaking,

18:50.760 --> 18:52.720
yeah, yeah, I would be riveted.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.440
Yes, keep on going, man.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.960
It's, I think it's sound advice to be like,

18:56.960 --> 18:59.160
let your lawyers represent you in a trial.

18:59.160 --> 19:03.800
A man who takes himself as a client has a fool for a lawyer.

19:03.800 --> 19:04.640
Yeah.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.160
So Alex is really getting into this idea

19:06.160 --> 19:07.720
that Trump needs to get up there

19:07.720 --> 19:10.400
and lambast the entire Congress.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.840
Yeah, I think that'd work.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.720
And then he pulls out a really weird quote.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.400
Right out of the real footage

19:16.400 --> 19:20.160
of the famous House Committee on Un-American Activities,

19:21.920 --> 19:24.280
and then the Senate Committee on Un-American Activities,

19:24.280 --> 19:26.520
and the lawyer says, have you no decency?

19:26.520 --> 19:28.480
You know, just that point.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.360
And I mean, I could go into that trial

19:31.360 --> 19:35.320
and annihilate them, annihilate them.

19:35.320 --> 19:36.640
This is their Waterloo.

19:36.640 --> 19:39.720
But of course, they're always the aggressive globalist.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.960
We always cower to them.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.440
We always act like we're the bad guys

19:42.440 --> 19:43.880
and we're on the defense.

19:43.880 --> 19:44.720
So that'd be great.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.120
The idea of Trump like having Alex

19:47.120 --> 19:49.400
as his sort of representative in court.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.880
I thought it was going to be the best it could be

19:51.880 --> 19:53.440
with Trump representing himself.

19:53.440 --> 19:56.480
But now the idea of Trump represented by Alex Jones

19:56.480 --> 19:58.120
has one upped it again.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.320
God damn.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.800
It would be a zoo.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.840
It would just, I don't even, I couldn't even imagine it.

20:03.840 --> 20:04.680
I would love it.

20:04.680 --> 20:05.520
It would be perfect.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.720
Now that famous quote that have you no sense of decency,

20:08.720 --> 20:11.160
that's an interesting thing for Alex to pull out.

20:11.160 --> 20:13.200
That line was spoken by Joseph Welch,

20:13.200 --> 20:14.720
a lawyer who's representing the army

20:14.720 --> 20:16.760
in a case against Joseph McCarthy.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.000
McCarthy had accused one of the young attorneys

20:19.000 --> 20:21.520
working with Welch of being connected to the communists.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.080
And that is what prompted Welch

20:23.080 --> 20:25.040
to question McCarthy's decency.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.920
The beginning of the quote is actually quote,

20:26.920 --> 20:28.480
and tell this moment, Senator,

20:28.480 --> 20:30.440
I think I never really gauged your cruelty

20:30.440 --> 20:32.200
or your recklessness.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.760
This hearing was being broadcast on television

20:34.760 --> 20:39.720
and most essentially it destroyed Joseph McCarthy's career.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.520
At least in part because it clearly exposed

20:41.520 --> 20:43.960
how much of a witch hunt McCarthy was engaging in.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.640
Alex loves Joseph McCarthy

20:45.640 --> 20:47.600
and thinks that the House Un-American Activities Committee

20:47.600 --> 20:48.920
was absolutely legitimate

20:48.920 --> 20:50.200
and they were doing the essential work

20:50.200 --> 20:51.960
of rooting out commies.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.960
Alex shouldn't celebrate the line have you no decency.

20:54.960 --> 20:57.040
I was really confused by that

20:57.040 --> 21:00.360
because it was directed towards the guy.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.920
That's what threw me for a loop.

21:01.920 --> 21:02.760
No.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.040
Okay, so he's saying he really could have taken it

21:05.040 --> 21:06.760
to Joseph McCarthy if he had.

21:06.760 --> 21:10.360
He's saying that he could be that lawyer

21:10.360 --> 21:12.520
saying it to like Nancy Pelosi.

21:12.520 --> 21:13.360
Right.

21:13.360 --> 21:14.200
Or I guess Chuck Schumer

21:14.200 --> 21:15.160
because it would be in the Senate.

21:15.160 --> 21:16.800
He doesn't understand how things work.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.640
Nope.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.560
He's evoking something that should be like a deep wound

21:20.560 --> 21:22.160
in his anti-communist psyche.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you destroyed the guy

21:23.640 --> 21:26.880
who I think or I think could have solved

21:26.880 --> 21:30.120
all of our non-white problems, yeah.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.680
So in this next clip,

21:31.680 --> 21:35.720
we get one of the more unsettling ideas

21:35.720 --> 21:39.480
that Alex has about the Boogaloo types.

21:39.480 --> 21:43.160
And this is something that we've heard him express before

21:43.160 --> 21:47.720
and it's a revelation that he kinda can tell

21:47.720 --> 21:51.480
whether or not a group is real or not by who they target.

21:51.480 --> 21:52.520
Okay, that's great.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.520
They wanna accelerate us into a physical conflict

21:55.520 --> 21:57.480
because they believe they can kill our free society

21:57.480 --> 21:59.600
and submit their takeover that way.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.440
That's why they're gonna lead paramilitary groups

22:01.440 --> 22:04.280
that are either knowingly controlled or unknowingly controlled

22:04.280 --> 22:06.480
because of their low IQs

22:06.480 --> 22:09.560
into hitting targets that are not good targets.

22:09.560 --> 22:12.480
I mean, let me tell you, I'm not saying kill anybody, okay?

22:12.480 --> 22:15.360
But you know, the globalists coming at us

22:15.360 --> 22:16.320
with these deadly vaccines

22:16.320 --> 22:17.960
that they know are meant to be populated,

22:17.960 --> 22:21.360
the super unpopular top globalists, Klaus Schwab,

22:21.360 --> 22:24.480
Bill Gates, notice you never see anybody

22:24.480 --> 22:27.480
actually going after the people above Biden, above Trump.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.400
There's all the secret service from the president

22:30.400 --> 22:32.800
to make you think they actually run things.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.640
Seem disappointed that people aren't making runs

22:35.640 --> 22:37.200
at Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab.

22:37.200 --> 22:40.560
All right, I wrote this down as a quote.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.400
I'm not saying kill anybody.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.240
But you know.

22:43.240 --> 22:44.080
But you know.

22:44.080 --> 22:44.920
You know.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.760
That's words that mean kill people.

22:47.760 --> 22:48.880
You know.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.600
No, that's me.

22:50.600 --> 22:51.440
Yeah.

22:51.440 --> 22:52.520
No, that's kill people.

22:52.520 --> 22:55.880
Yeah, I think that the message is astoundingly clear.

22:55.880 --> 22:57.480
Absolutely clear.

22:57.480 --> 23:00.840
I'm not saying kill anybody, but that's what.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.800
See now, if I'm not saying kill anybody,

23:03.800 --> 23:06.360
I'm going to say, I'm not saying kill anybody, period.

23:06.360 --> 23:07.200
Period.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.240
Period in that sentence.

23:08.240 --> 23:11.920
Not comma, because nothing that comes after that comma

23:11.920 --> 23:14.440
is gonna be anything other than, but we should kill people.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.800
You know, the next clause is generally gonna be like.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.200
Negates the first clause.

23:18.200 --> 23:21.440
Yeah, or at least delineates like circumstances

23:21.440 --> 23:24.200
where the first clause doesn't apply.

23:24.200 --> 23:26.240
By the rules of grammar,

23:26.240 --> 23:29.240
Alex has called for violent revolution.

23:29.240 --> 23:30.080
Does feel that way.

23:30.080 --> 23:30.920
Yeah.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.960
So, but the thing that he's calling for even more

23:32.960 --> 23:35.440
is that Trump needs to turn this damn impeachment trial

23:35.440 --> 23:36.280
into a circus.

23:36.280 --> 23:37.120
I love it.

23:37.120 --> 23:38.560
And we need to get that message to Trump

23:38.560 --> 23:39.640
and we are getting that message to him

23:39.640 --> 23:41.120
that he needs to go on the offense.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.400
He needs to demand to face his accusers.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.480
He needs to demand to be in that Senate trial.

23:45.480 --> 23:48.080
He needs to make it three weeks long, a month long.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.320
Suck all the oxygen out of Biden.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.720
And I hate to even say all this on air,

23:51.720 --> 23:53.360
but this is the advice I've actually gotten to the president.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.360
I'll leave it at that.

23:54.360 --> 23:58.360
He needs to just demand, because I mean, in a real trial,

23:58.360 --> 23:59.880
he could have a two month trial.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.600
And Trump just needs to dominate,

24:01.600 --> 24:03.040
suck all the air out of Biden.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.760
And he can literally turn this whole thing around

24:04.760 --> 24:08.320
against him if he doesn't abide that he's been defeated.

24:08.320 --> 24:11.480
I can tell you, he doesn't feel defeated,

24:11.480 --> 24:14.200
but he just feels totally sick of it and pissed off

24:14.200 --> 24:15.240
that this was allowed to happen.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.320
And I'm telling you, Trump needs to go on the offense.

24:17.320 --> 24:19.160
They're telling him behind the scenes just on record

24:19.160 --> 24:21.400
that if he shuts up and goes along and rolls over,

24:21.400 --> 24:22.480
they're gonna leave him alone.

24:22.480 --> 24:23.320
No, they're not.

24:23.320 --> 24:24.240
The only way they leave him alone

24:24.240 --> 24:25.200
is when they're defeated.

24:25.200 --> 24:28.680
This is like the same shit he was saying four years ago.

24:28.680 --> 24:29.720
Yeah.

24:29.720 --> 24:30.560
Yep.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.760
They're saying like, oh, just leave this alone

24:32.760 --> 24:34.000
and we'll leave you alone.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.520
Like, no, these globalists, they're making these deals.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.960
It's just, this is so boring.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.480
Yeah.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.480
He's talking about his own feelings.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.760
I know, I'm disappointed to be in reruns

24:44.760 --> 24:46.120
of reality right now.

24:46.120 --> 24:47.560
This is really a bummer.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.760
You can almost feel it, the way he's,

24:49.760 --> 24:53.360
the manner of speech, he's just coming up with things

24:53.360 --> 24:56.600
that he, Alex personally feels and applying them to Trump.

24:56.600 --> 24:57.440
Yep, yep.

24:57.440 --> 24:58.280
It's ridiculous.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.240
I would like to yell at Nancy Pelosi.

25:00.240 --> 25:03.720
So strangely enough, my advice to Trump is to yell at,

25:03.720 --> 25:07.720
he should do what I wish I could do, is all he's saying.

25:07.720 --> 25:08.560
Yeah.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.240
So there's big Proud Boy news.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.080
Sure.

25:11.080 --> 25:12.120
Also, it should be pointed out

25:12.120 --> 25:14.720
that Alex was jumped into the Proud Boys

25:14.720 --> 25:17.640
by Gavin McGinnis on air on Infowars.

25:17.640 --> 25:18.480
That's true.

25:18.480 --> 25:19.680
So he is technically a Proud Boy.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.520
That is true.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.360
He aimed cereals.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.320
That is true.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.440
While Gavin was giving him little silly punches.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.080
Yeah, I think that should be actionable.

25:27.080 --> 25:28.680
Rufio Panman.

25:28.680 --> 25:29.520
Yes.

25:29.520 --> 25:30.520
Based stick man.

25:30.520 --> 25:31.800
Right.

25:31.800 --> 25:35.840
Gavin McGinnis, Alex Jones, Rambo Joe Biggs.

25:35.840 --> 25:38.320
What a murderer's row of shit bags.

25:38.320 --> 25:39.920
But there's news about one of the other members.

25:39.920 --> 25:40.760
Okay.

25:40.760 --> 25:43.480
All right, we've got some really big Proud Boy news

25:43.480 --> 25:45.160
that's gonna be breaking next segment.

25:45.160 --> 25:46.520
I wish I never had to hear that sentence.

25:46.520 --> 25:49.480
I wanna cover this very important topic right now.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.160
The Left is not created.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.000
Okay.

25:54.000 --> 25:54.840
What?

25:54.840 --> 25:56.680
Big Proud Boy news.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.320
The Left doesn't know how to make memes as well as I do.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.120
Yeah, I'm the meme machine.

26:01.120 --> 26:01.960
That's what they call me.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.240
Yeah.

26:03.240 --> 26:04.920
Yeah, all right, great.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.520
So yeah, there was news that came out

26:06.520 --> 26:10.680
that in the past, Enrique Tarrio.

26:10.680 --> 26:12.080
Yeah, he was an informant, right?

26:12.080 --> 26:12.920
Yes.

26:12.920 --> 26:16.680
I've read these stories and I'm not sure

26:16.680 --> 26:21.360
that I see concrete indications that he still is.

26:21.360 --> 26:22.200
Right.

26:22.200 --> 26:24.360
And I can see that going either way.

26:24.360 --> 26:25.200
Right.

26:25.200 --> 26:28.880
And so I am gonna withhold any kind of judgment

26:28.880 --> 26:31.400
or any declaration on what his current behaviors are.

26:31.400 --> 26:32.240
Right, right, right.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.920
Because I'm not involved and I've never met the guy

26:33.920 --> 26:35.080
and I don't give a shit.

26:35.080 --> 26:38.720
Now, I would say if I were Alex, I might be worried.

26:38.720 --> 26:41.000
Because Enrique Tarrio's been on Alex's show

26:41.000 --> 26:42.400
a bunch of times.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.160
He was really good friends with Joe Biggs

26:44.160 --> 26:45.360
who just got arrested.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.760
Well, there's that.

26:46.760 --> 26:50.920
I would say that Alex might have,

26:50.920 --> 26:54.400
or Joe Biggs might have, said some things

26:54.400 --> 26:56.920
that you wouldn't want to say to an informant.

26:56.920 --> 26:59.840
Well, I bet they probably didn't text it

26:59.840 --> 27:01.160
to each other though, Dan.

27:01.160 --> 27:02.760
I don't know if that's the case.

27:02.760 --> 27:06.840
And like I said, I still need to see further indications

27:06.840 --> 27:10.440
to feel at least, you know, like convinced

27:10.440 --> 27:13.720
that he was like snitching on the Proud Boys or whatever.

27:13.720 --> 27:15.800
See now, this is a problem for me.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.360
It is kind of funny.

27:17.360 --> 27:18.320
This is a problem for me.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.000
This is what I'm talking about

27:20.000 --> 27:21.880
with higher class of criminal, all right?

27:21.880 --> 27:25.120
The Proud Boys are also really bad at being a gang.

27:25.120 --> 27:28.400
Like in Chicago, if you get taken up by the cops

27:28.400 --> 27:31.320
and you're in a gang, man, they just assume you talk.

27:31.320 --> 27:32.440
It doesn't matter.

27:32.440 --> 27:34.120
It doesn't matter if you talked or not.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.280
You can't take that risk.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.120
Sure.

27:37.120 --> 27:37.960
So they can.

27:37.960 --> 27:41.440
Of course you say Enrique Tarrio is an informant,

27:41.440 --> 27:42.720
whether he is or not.

27:42.720 --> 27:43.840
You gotta get him out of there.

27:43.840 --> 27:47.680
I think if you're doing like security for the Proud Boys,

27:47.680 --> 27:48.520
yes.

27:49.520 --> 27:52.440
I understand making that like sort of safety decision.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.280
Right.

27:53.280 --> 27:54.120
I understand that.

27:54.120 --> 27:56.200
This is a gang that punches you

27:56.200 --> 27:58.400
and makes you name cereals to get in.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.520
I understand that.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.040
I understand that.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.400
They should get into meth is what I'm trying to say.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.240
Isn't that what I'm saying?

28:04.240 --> 28:08.680
Maybe our expectations for how tight a ship they run

28:08.680 --> 28:10.120
should be adjusted.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.200
They're also-

28:11.200 --> 28:12.600
They do not have a string or bell.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.560
No. That is for sure.

28:13.560 --> 28:14.400
No.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.000
They laugh at Gavin McGinnis' jokes.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.840
It's not a good group.

28:18.840 --> 28:19.880
No, that's not good.

28:19.880 --> 28:22.480
So Alex has some vaccine news.

28:22.480 --> 28:23.920
Also, you have some vaccine news,

28:23.920 --> 28:25.040
like you mentioned up top.

28:25.040 --> 28:25.880
I have good news.

28:25.880 --> 28:27.160
Yep, Alex has some other news.

28:27.160 --> 28:28.000
Oh.

28:28.000 --> 28:28.840
Hey, did you hear?

28:28.840 --> 28:31.360
Merck has pulled its two vaccines

28:31.360 --> 28:34.680
because of major health problems and bad reactions,

28:34.680 --> 28:38.560
both their mRNA vaccine and their regular vaccine

28:38.560 --> 28:40.920
that had a bizarre measles delivery system.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.840
Those have been pulled and they say it doesn't work

28:42.840 --> 28:45.440
and it's dangerous and you shouldn't take a vaccine

28:45.440 --> 28:48.000
because they know the house of cards is coming down.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.160
Alex isn't wrong about the underlying story here.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.720
And that is that Merck did in fact abandon its attempts

28:53.720 --> 28:57.040
to create two experimental coronavirus vaccines this week.

28:57.040 --> 28:58.360
However, the message of this story

28:58.360 --> 29:01.640
is completely misrepresented by Alex into being anti-vax.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.080
In reality, a story like this

29:03.080 --> 29:04.960
should give people even more confidence

29:04.960 --> 29:06.640
about the vaccines that are widely available

29:06.640 --> 29:08.120
because this clearly demonstrates

29:08.120 --> 29:11.040
that there are some vaccines that don't make the cut.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.960
These two that were developed by Merck

29:12.960 --> 29:15.680
are not the same ones that were made by Pfizer or Moderna.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.600
So pointing at this story

29:17.600 --> 29:20.440
as a way to make those vaccines look bad makes no sense,

29:20.440 --> 29:22.520
but that's exactly what Alex is doing.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.120
Alex is also just lying when he says

29:24.120 --> 29:26.160
that Merck decided to stop pursuing these vaccines

29:26.160 --> 29:27.600
because of bad reactions.

29:27.600 --> 29:30.320
From NPR, quote, Merck is halting development

29:30.320 --> 29:32.280
of its two COVID-19 vaccine candidates

29:32.280 --> 29:34.400
saying that while the drugs seem to be safe,

29:34.400 --> 29:36.520
they didn't generate enough of an immune response

29:36.520 --> 29:39.040
to effectively protect people against the coronavirus.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.040
So they just didn't work.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.800
Yeah, Merck spent a ton of money

29:41.800 --> 29:43.440
on developing these potential vaccines

29:43.440 --> 29:45.200
and ultimately it didn't work.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.000
The fact that this happens pretty regularly

29:47.000 --> 29:49.640
is actually an indictment of Alex's fictional worldview.

29:49.640 --> 29:50.920
And it's really interesting

29:50.920 --> 29:52.440
to see him reporting on a story

29:52.440 --> 29:54.360
that's a huge problem for his narratives

29:54.360 --> 29:56.040
as if it somehow validates them.

29:56.040 --> 29:57.120
It's very weird.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.360
Yeah, but the narrative for them is

29:59.360 --> 30:02.480
if the system isn't working, the system isn't working.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.680
And the system is, if it is working,

30:04.680 --> 30:06.160
then the system isn't working

30:06.160 --> 30:08.480
because if it's working, it's trying to kill you.

30:08.480 --> 30:09.320
Maybe.

30:09.320 --> 30:10.240
And that idea of like-

30:10.240 --> 30:11.280
I think in this case,

30:11.280 --> 30:13.680
it's more just like a sleight of hand thing

30:13.680 --> 30:16.840
where it's like these vaccines got recalled.

30:16.840 --> 30:19.800
Now, how can you trust this completely separate vaccine?

30:19.800 --> 30:21.320
And then also just making shit up.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.160
Yeah, I mean, the obvious thing for him,

30:24.160 --> 30:27.360
the obvious problem there is that this in many ways

30:27.360 --> 30:29.080
is essentially the free market

30:29.080 --> 30:30.840
working the way it's supposed to.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.720
They don't have a product they can sell

30:32.720 --> 30:34.040
so they can't sell it.

30:34.040 --> 30:34.880
Yeah.

30:34.880 --> 30:35.720
It's very simple.

30:35.720 --> 30:38.240
But Alex would believe that even if they did have a product

30:38.240 --> 30:41.120
that was ineffective because everything is about money,

30:41.120 --> 30:43.840
just 100%, they would still sell it

30:43.840 --> 30:45.040
even though it wasn't effective

30:45.040 --> 30:47.000
because they'd sunk so much money into it.

30:47.000 --> 30:47.840
Of course.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.960
He just doesn't, he has an incoherent worldview.

30:49.960 --> 30:50.800
Doesn't care.

30:50.800 --> 30:54.720
Anyway, Alex is gonna get to interviewing this Boogaloo

30:54.720 --> 30:58.360
gentleman and it's interesting

30:58.360 --> 31:02.160
because he can't quite figure out where to place himself

31:02.160 --> 31:03.000
because he's like,

31:03.000 --> 31:06.600
you do have a responsibility to overthrow a government.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.040
Well, he already said earlier,

31:08.040 --> 31:10.400
I'm not saying kill anybody, but you know.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.320
And that theme may develop later.

31:12.320 --> 31:13.160
I believe that.

31:13.160 --> 31:16.160
This just is really, this makes no sense to me.

31:16.160 --> 31:17.600
I believe the Declaration of Independence.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.400
I believe that when we have a destructive government

31:19.400 --> 31:21.160
that has come after our freedoms and our rights

31:21.160 --> 31:24.480
and that has proven itself to be an authoritarian force

31:24.480 --> 31:26.440
that isn't going away, it's not just our right,

31:26.440 --> 31:29.180
it's our duty to throw off such a force.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.760
But I don't wanna stupidly do it.

31:31.760 --> 31:32.960
I don't wanna be led by the ADL,

31:32.960 --> 31:33.880
the Southern Poverty Law Center.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.840
I don't wanna be led by idiots.

31:35.840 --> 31:38.720
I don't want to go with the wrong targets

31:38.720 --> 31:43.640
and I wanna exhaust every form of unofficial warfare

31:43.640 --> 31:47.520
because war is just politics by other means,

31:47.520 --> 31:49.000
as Von Bismarck said.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.200
The pen is my iron sword.

31:51.200 --> 31:55.320
And so I'm not very good at war if I can't win with the pen.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.760
And so I'm really trying to do that.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.400
You're not gonna win with the pen or a sword.

31:59.400 --> 32:03.560
But I just, I don't understand what he's saying

32:03.560 --> 32:05.360
other than kill my enemies.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.180
Yes.

32:06.180 --> 32:07.760
Because he's saying that these,

32:07.760 --> 32:08.880
like I don't wanna be led

32:08.880 --> 32:10.960
by the Southern Poverty Law Center or the ADL.

32:10.960 --> 32:11.800
That's meaningless.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.520
That's just nonsense.

32:13.520 --> 32:16.920
But the problem that he seems to have

32:16.920 --> 32:19.600
is that these groups aren't doing what he wants.

32:19.600 --> 32:20.440
Yes.

32:20.440 --> 32:21.720
Yes, that's a real issue.

32:21.720 --> 32:24.400
Because he says that you have a responsibility

32:24.400 --> 32:25.760
to throw off this government

32:25.760 --> 32:28.040
once it reaches X, Y, and Z point.

32:28.040 --> 32:28.880
Right.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.540
His show is essentially all about

32:30.540 --> 32:32.720
how we've reached X, Y, and Z point.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.320
99% of it, yes.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.160
Yeah.

32:35.160 --> 32:35.980
Also the left is uncreative.

32:35.980 --> 32:36.880
That's true.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.640
Those are basically the two themes.

32:38.640 --> 32:42.600
Yeah, so he makes a career out of arguing

32:42.600 --> 32:43.680
that we have reached the point

32:43.680 --> 32:46.040
where it's essential to throw off the government

32:46.040 --> 32:48.040
and then you have these people who are like,

32:48.040 --> 32:50.120
well, eh?

32:50.120 --> 32:51.600
Well, he made a career out of it.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.060
If he hadn't made a career out of it,

32:53.060 --> 32:56.200
he would be more interested in people actually doing it.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.640
Yeah, probably.

32:57.640 --> 32:58.920
Because there's not a money in that.

32:58.920 --> 32:59.880
Exactly.

32:59.880 --> 33:00.880
Yeah.

33:00.880 --> 33:03.680
So now we get to the point where Mike Dunn,

33:03.680 --> 33:07.600
Boogaloo Boy extraordinaire comes on for the interview.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.480
And this note that I have right here on this clip is just,

33:10.480 --> 33:11.840
this is a bad idea.

33:11.840 --> 33:12.660
Oh.

33:12.660 --> 33:14.320
Now, Mike Dunn, I appreciate him coming on.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.160
Usually people we disagree with are cowards.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.560
They don't come on.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.000
So he gets landmarks coming on.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.480
And Mike Dunn is a well-known Boogaloo Boy.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.040
They call him the leader, the founder,

33:23.040 --> 33:25.040
constitutional adherent, 20-year-old,

33:25.040 --> 33:28.520
former Trump supporter, turned libertarian.

33:28.520 --> 33:30.520
I guess he was in the Marines too as well.

33:30.520 --> 33:31.520
And so I'm going to try to give him

33:31.520 --> 33:32.640
the floor of the rest of this segment.

33:32.640 --> 33:33.960
We've got about seven minutes left.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.760
Then I've got my questions and my comments.

33:35.760 --> 33:37.240
So he wants to set us straight.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.400
We're all about folks that want to set us straight.

33:39.400 --> 33:40.920
And if I'm wrong, I will apologize.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.120
So Mike, thanks for coming on.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.600
None of that is accurate.

33:44.600 --> 33:45.100
Mm.

33:45.100 --> 33:48.320
Yeah.

33:48.320 --> 33:48.960
Yeah.

33:48.960 --> 33:52.640
It's funny too, whenever Owen Schroyer, who's also there,

33:52.640 --> 33:55.800
chiming in periodically, he is complaining

33:55.800 --> 33:58.200
about these other people who are too cowardly to come on.

33:58.200 --> 34:01.520
It's like, Brian Stelter, Rachel Maddow.

34:01.520 --> 34:02.980
Yeah, they're not going to come on.

34:02.980 --> 34:03.480
No.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.020
No, no, they're not going to come on.

34:05.020 --> 34:07.080
Also, maybe the reason that he's coming on

34:07.080 --> 34:10.240
is because he's not your, he doesn't disagree with you.

34:10.240 --> 34:10.740
Yeah.

34:10.740 --> 34:13.920
I'm not saying that you guys are wrong.

34:13.920 --> 34:17.280
Maybe he recognizes that you are very usable.

34:17.280 --> 34:17.920
Yeah.

34:17.920 --> 34:18.640
Yeah.

34:18.640 --> 34:22.880
You are a platform that is exploitable for his purposes.

34:22.880 --> 34:26.000
Which he could have learned is a lot easier

34:26.000 --> 34:28.200
than he might think if he had listened to our show.

34:28.200 --> 34:28.680
Sure.

34:28.680 --> 34:30.080
I mean, Steve Pajanik laid it out.

34:30.080 --> 34:30.680
Exactly.

34:30.680 --> 34:31.680
That's all you got to do.

34:31.680 --> 34:32.960
Alex, you are fucking so easy.

34:32.960 --> 34:33.680
So easy.

34:33.680 --> 34:34.240
Yeah.

34:34.240 --> 34:37.320
So Mike starts off, like I said, the first thing he does

34:37.320 --> 34:40.400
is correct Alex about the leadership.

34:40.400 --> 34:41.200
Right.

34:41.200 --> 34:43.400
First things first, I'm not the leader of the Boogaloo.

34:43.400 --> 34:44.240
I'm not the founder.

34:44.240 --> 34:45.640
It's an autonomous movement.

34:45.640 --> 34:47.440
I'm just someone who's in the movement who

34:47.440 --> 34:50.800
helped make it big in the media limelight and public face.

34:50.800 --> 34:54.560
And I happen to control a large portion of the movement.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.060
So I just wanted to get that straight.

34:56.060 --> 34:57.520
The movement was not founded by me,

34:57.520 --> 34:58.920
and I'm not the leader of it.

34:58.920 --> 35:01.760
Simply a prominent figure in it.

35:01.760 --> 35:04.680
I control a large portion of it is an interesting.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.160
That's a strange.

35:06.160 --> 35:06.760
Yeah.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.600
I control a large, how large a portion?

35:08.600 --> 35:09.160
I don't know.

35:09.160 --> 35:13.880
But he is a guy who there was a Vice article and video

35:13.880 --> 35:17.560
about him done, I believe, last year.

35:17.560 --> 35:21.960
And it sort of traces some of his roots

35:21.960 --> 35:27.240
from being a Virginia gun rights militia type, which

35:27.240 --> 35:29.960
if you recall a year ago, Alex was super into.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.920
Loved it.

35:32.920 --> 35:36.400
And then through that, he fell in with Boogaloo communities

35:36.400 --> 35:37.160
and what have you.

35:37.160 --> 35:40.600
I assume the article started with Mike Dunn dot dot dot

35:40.600 --> 35:42.960
or Mike Fun question mark.

35:42.960 --> 35:45.320
And then just a Hawaiian shirt emoji.

35:45.320 --> 35:46.440
Yeah.

35:46.440 --> 35:49.480
Yeah, so he was involved prior to getting

35:49.480 --> 35:51.680
into the Boogaloo stuff in just a lot of stuff

35:51.680 --> 35:55.360
that Alex is super, super into and capitalized

35:55.360 --> 35:57.920
on the gun rights rally in Virginia

35:57.920 --> 36:01.120
that Alex talks about all the time.

36:01.120 --> 36:04.080
Some of the malicious stuff that Mike was involved in

36:04.080 --> 36:06.360
was involved in that.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.520
No, it's almost like a lot of these far right guys

36:08.520 --> 36:12.600
are almost giving these exit interviews with these people

36:12.600 --> 36:16.200
like, hey, you did a great job, but we got to cut you loose.

36:16.200 --> 36:18.560
And by cut you loose, I mean blame you for everything

36:18.560 --> 36:20.640
that we've done.

36:20.640 --> 36:23.760
And the flip side of it is kind of a don't meet your heroes.

36:23.760 --> 36:24.640
Yeah.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.000
Kind of lesson for all these people who

36:27.000 --> 36:28.720
are coming on to Alex's show.

36:28.720 --> 36:32.680
Wait a second, I thought you liked us.

36:32.680 --> 36:36.240
I thought you were great, Alex, but unfortunately, oh

36:36.240 --> 36:37.960
boy, Mike.

36:37.960 --> 36:41.040
Mike is, I think that he can tell that Alex

36:41.040 --> 36:42.240
is trying to set him up.

36:42.240 --> 36:43.040
Yeah.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.040
Because Alex is trying to be a dick to him.

36:45.040 --> 36:46.720
And I think that Mike knows that,

36:46.720 --> 36:51.360
and he's a millennial Gen Z kind of guy.

36:51.360 --> 36:52.280
Gen Z, I guess.

36:52.280 --> 36:53.520
But, or Zoom?

36:53.520 --> 36:54.320
What's it called?

36:54.320 --> 36:55.080
Don't even worry about it.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.160
I don't know the name of Generations.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.400
Don't worry about it.

36:57.400 --> 37:00.160
But he's a youth, and he's equipped

37:00.160 --> 37:01.520
to handle Alex's bullshit.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.400
Trouble.

37:02.400 --> 37:04.440
To start with, Alex, you started with a quote.

37:04.440 --> 37:07.120
I want to address that as well, from yourself.

37:07.120 --> 37:08.200
Here's some other quotes from you.

37:08.200 --> 37:11.360
1776 is the answer to 1984.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.320
You also said if just 5% of people

37:13.320 --> 37:15.960
got motivated in some direction, and it doesn't

37:15.960 --> 37:19.000
have to be what I believe in, but if they got motivated

37:19.000 --> 37:21.760
and stopped getting their political ideologies

37:21.760 --> 37:25.920
from the media, they would go and figure out what they want.

37:25.920 --> 37:27.280
And we're literally doing that.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.440
We have been motivated.

37:29.440 --> 37:32.400
We figured out what we wanted, which is freedom from tyranny.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.920
And we're willing to stand against that.

37:33.920 --> 37:37.560
When you say 1776 is the answer to 1984 and your involvement

37:37.560 --> 37:40.400
in the Capitol incidents, I know you can put up

37:40.400 --> 37:41.960
an article from the Gateway Pundit

37:41.960 --> 37:45.280
accusing me of inciting the violence and blah, blah, blah.

37:45.280 --> 37:47.560
Feeding into the media narrative like you

37:47.560 --> 37:49.440
don't want others to do.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.240
Hold on a second.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.480
I don't mean to interrupt you.

37:51.480 --> 37:52.880
I don't see what they're putting up.

37:52.880 --> 37:55.120
Let's not put the articles up right now.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.640
I'll get to my questions coming up.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.520
I want him to have the floor uninterrupted.

37:58.520 --> 37:59.360
Please continue.

37:59.360 --> 38:03.560
Alex is giving him a lot of space, and I think it's very

38:03.560 --> 38:04.040
weird.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.880
Oh, you weren't supposed to listen to me when I talked.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.160
You're definitely not supposed to come back at me with things

38:08.160 --> 38:08.840
that I've said before.

38:08.840 --> 38:11.560
You're definitely not supposed to use my words and ideas

38:11.560 --> 38:13.800
to justify your beliefs and your actions

38:13.800 --> 38:15.240
that I'm supposed to be condemning.

38:15.240 --> 38:18.440
Yeah, because they are my words, and boy, they sound

38:18.440 --> 38:20.000
exactly like what you're doing.

38:20.000 --> 38:20.520
Oh, boy.

38:20.520 --> 38:21.920
I'm in trouble now.

38:21.920 --> 38:22.680
Whoops.

38:22.680 --> 38:26.160
I imagine that's his thought process is just like, oh, no,

38:26.160 --> 38:27.080
he used words.

38:27.080 --> 38:27.600
Yeah.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.240
Oh, shit.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.800
Again, I wouldn't have done this interview if I were Alex.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.840
I think this is a bad idea.

38:32.840 --> 38:35.840
I think that he thinks that he can do these gotcha moments,

38:35.840 --> 38:39.000
like the Bill Ayers interview or David Rothschild.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.200
And it just, he's so bad at this.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.720
He's really good at steamrolling con men.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.320
He's not good at talking to people

38:46.320 --> 38:48.200
who have actual beliefs.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.040
Yeah, it's trouble.

38:49.040 --> 38:53.320
I don't agree with Mike, and I don't trust him.

38:53.320 --> 38:57.560
I don't think he's being necessarily above board

38:57.560 --> 39:00.040
and fully honest, even in this interview,

39:00.040 --> 39:02.680
that I do believe that he has beliefs more

39:02.680 --> 39:05.560
than Alex, and that's a problem.

39:05.560 --> 39:06.560
Alex can't handle it.

39:06.560 --> 39:10.360
And beliefs that are almost certainly inspired by Alex.

39:10.360 --> 39:15.360
Yes, and he is aware enough to recognize that Alex doesn't

39:15.360 --> 39:18.200
actually have those beliefs, and that's not good.

39:18.200 --> 39:18.880
Uh-oh.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.720
But 1776 is the answer to 1984.

39:21.720 --> 39:25.600
I want to paint you a picture from 1776.

39:25.600 --> 39:29.080
January 18th, Major Habersheen arrests a royal governor,

39:29.080 --> 39:30.000
James Wright.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.120
March 2nd, Americans begin shelling Boston, March 4th.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.880
We captured Dorchester Heights after a bloody battle.

39:35.880 --> 39:38.040
April 7th, we had a bloody major sea battle.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.160
August 27th, we had the Battle of Long Island.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.080
September 15th, we had another bloody battle.

39:42.080 --> 39:45.440
September 21st, New York City, a quarter of it was burned.

39:45.440 --> 39:47.240
October 11th, we had another bloody battle.

39:47.240 --> 39:50.000
That's just one of the many instances of 1776.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.240
So when you call for 1776, I almost

39:54.240 --> 39:56.080
feel like you're doing it just for the merch and not

39:56.080 --> 39:58.160
for the actual fact.

39:58.160 --> 40:03.360
We understand that our laws, our avenues

40:03.360 --> 40:05.200
that we should go through, have been clogged up

40:05.200 --> 40:06.880
by old men in politics.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.600
Politicians who were there for the money,

40:08.600 --> 40:09.680
they've been clogged up.

40:09.680 --> 40:12.080
They blocked us from actually having access to our rights.

40:12.080 --> 40:14.400
They've infringed upon constitutional rights,

40:14.400 --> 40:16.320
whether it be the First Amendment, the Second

40:16.320 --> 40:18.400
Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, it doesn't matter.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.640
They've infringed on those rights,

40:20.640 --> 40:22.720
and we realize that those avenues are no longer open to

40:22.720 --> 40:23.200
us.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.000
And so the only answer to that is

40:25.000 --> 40:27.120
to try to win the hearts and the minds of the people.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.280
And ultimately, there is going to be a revolution.

40:29.280 --> 40:31.600
Even you know this, and I know this.

40:31.600 --> 40:32.400
Even you.

40:32.400 --> 40:34.840
This is fucked for Alex.

40:34.840 --> 40:35.320
Wow.

40:35.320 --> 40:36.920
This is not good.

40:36.920 --> 40:37.440
No.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.080
This is a terrible situation for him

40:39.080 --> 40:40.960
to be in because he's being rightly

40:40.960 --> 40:46.000
confronted about his using Americana for merch and shit.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.600
That is a valid criticism for it to be levied against Alex.

40:49.600 --> 40:53.400
But he's also being scolded by somebody

40:53.400 --> 40:58.360
who stands to deeper radicalize, perhaps, his audience.

40:58.360 --> 41:01.640
Yeah, I'm interested in that push and pull

41:01.640 --> 41:04.400
because it does seem like there are twisted motivations here

41:04.400 --> 41:05.040
for Alex.

41:05.040 --> 41:07.920
Like one, of course, he has to be top dog.

41:07.920 --> 41:12.040
But two, he does want to give these exact ideas a platform.

41:12.040 --> 41:12.480
True.

41:12.480 --> 41:16.080
So that, to me, is part of why he's not interrupting so much.

41:16.080 --> 41:16.680
Yeah.

41:16.680 --> 41:20.480
It's hard for me to tell if it's like a way of painting

41:20.480 --> 41:23.760
this person as the fall guy, but also at the same time.

41:23.760 --> 41:25.560
Spreading his message.

41:25.560 --> 41:27.960
There is a part of me that feels like maybe that's

41:27.960 --> 41:28.640
what's going on.

41:28.640 --> 41:32.600
But I've seen enough interviews on Alex's show

41:32.600 --> 41:35.080
that are just like, he does not prepare at all.

41:35.080 --> 41:37.400
That he probably thought this was going to be a 20-year-old

41:37.400 --> 41:39.760
idiot who didn't know anything, who

41:39.760 --> 41:43.840
didn't have an awareness of Alex's career,

41:43.840 --> 41:47.160
didn't have an ability to stand up for himself.

41:47.160 --> 41:50.600
I would bet that he's just like, I'm going to talk to a tween?

41:50.600 --> 41:51.360
All right.

41:51.360 --> 41:52.560
I'm a man.

41:52.560 --> 41:53.560
Yeah, it is fascinating.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.600
I've been on there 27 years, man.

41:55.600 --> 42:02.160
It's really funny how completely clueless old people are,

42:02.160 --> 42:04.600
considering the fact that I believe

42:04.600 --> 42:09.080
that 90% of 16-year-olds are savvier and probably have

42:09.080 --> 42:10.840
a better education than I do.

42:10.840 --> 42:12.840
If you're under 23, I'm terrified, isn't it?

42:12.840 --> 42:13.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:13.560 --> 42:16.320
You have powers.

42:16.320 --> 42:18.640
You guys don't even know what kind of fucking powers

42:18.640 --> 42:19.800
you have yet.

42:19.800 --> 42:23.120
And you're not going to lose an argument to Alex fucking Jones.

42:23.120 --> 42:25.480
No, that's pretty clear.

42:25.480 --> 42:27.640
I think there are probably some 20-year-olds who would,

42:27.640 --> 42:32.280
but this guy is not what Alex expected, I don't believe.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.600
Now, the thing that I take issue with,

42:34.600 --> 42:37.840
or the thing that I'm worried about, is that this is a guy

42:37.840 --> 42:43.800
who stands to be a negative influence on Alex's audience,

42:43.800 --> 42:47.280
insomuch as there are people who are like Gavin McInnes,

42:47.280 --> 42:50.840
or Nick Fuentes, or E. Michael Jones, who

42:50.840 --> 42:54.760
come on Alex's show and stand to take audiences

42:54.760 --> 42:56.320
on a different path.

42:56.320 --> 42:59.200
Take them from this, I mean, it's bad,

42:59.200 --> 43:04.440
but there's kind of an exploitative, vampiric nature

43:04.440 --> 43:06.920
to Alex's just keeping people scared

43:06.920 --> 43:09.240
and then selling them dumb pills they don't need.

43:09.240 --> 43:09.960
Like, I hate it.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.760
It's an awful thing, but it's kind of,

43:12.760 --> 43:16.200
Alex has a vested interest in them not going too far.

43:16.200 --> 43:17.640
He's doing it for the merch.

43:17.640 --> 43:18.600
Yes.

43:18.600 --> 43:23.360
And falling into overtly anti-Semitic communities,

43:23.360 --> 43:26.440
starting to watch the American Journal.

43:26.440 --> 43:28.080
These kinds of things are dangerous,

43:28.080 --> 43:31.760
and I don't think that he is the right person, this Mike,

43:31.760 --> 43:34.400
to be making these critiques of Alex that

43:34.400 --> 43:37.080
are justified and fair.

43:37.080 --> 43:39.000
And one of the reasons is, I mean,

43:39.000 --> 43:40.640
Mike believes a lot of the same stuff

43:40.640 --> 43:44.600
that Alex does, like that the election was a fraudulent one.

43:44.600 --> 43:46.800
We all saw widespread voter fraud.

43:46.800 --> 43:49.200
We all understand what happened in the election.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.120
We're not Trump fans.

43:50.120 --> 43:51.080
We're not Biden fans.

43:51.080 --> 43:51.880
We understand that.

43:51.880 --> 43:54.640
But a lot of you hold on to the hope of voting your way out

43:54.640 --> 43:57.160
of voter fraud, which is an impossibility.

43:57.160 --> 43:59.440
We see it as there has to be a revolution.

43:59.440 --> 44:02.200
There has to be a result. And it's going to come to that.

44:02.200 --> 44:03.960
We preach unity, bottom scale unity,

44:03.960 --> 44:05.840
against the elitist, the globalist, the people

44:05.840 --> 44:07.480
who control our country, the people who

44:07.480 --> 44:10.640
control our presidents, which you talked about previously.

44:10.640 --> 44:12.840
We see that as a way to say, hey, we're a dumb attorney,

44:12.840 --> 44:14.360
and we're going to stand against it.

44:14.360 --> 44:17.640
We're part of those 3% that have stood up, or in your case,

44:17.640 --> 44:20.000
from your quote, it's just 5% of people.

44:20.000 --> 44:20.760
We're part of that.

44:20.760 --> 44:22.160
We're the ones who have stood up.

44:22.160 --> 44:25.560
And that's pretty much all I had to say concerning the boogaloo

44:25.560 --> 44:26.480
and what we're about.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.680
We're about freedom and liberty for all people,

44:28.680 --> 44:31.520
non-discrimination, and the Constitution

44:31.520 --> 44:34.280
being applicable to those who disagree with you.

44:34.280 --> 44:41.360
So this is a chance to launder and sell this group as,

44:41.360 --> 44:43.640
but I honestly don't even understand

44:43.640 --> 44:47.720
why he would say that as if it's a good thing on Info Wars.

44:47.720 --> 44:49.800
Like, we don't discriminate.

44:49.800 --> 44:51.960
This whole thing is about discriminating, man.

44:51.960 --> 44:55.800
Yeah, all I hear is, we're looking for the right boot

44:55.800 --> 44:56.720
to lick.

44:56.720 --> 44:58.520
We ran out of boots.

44:58.520 --> 45:00.560
Now we are hoping somebody will come up

45:00.560 --> 45:03.320
who will help us oppress the people we want to oppress.

45:03.320 --> 45:07.000
I don't know if I would agree that that's

45:07.000 --> 45:08.280
the vibe I get off Mike.

45:08.280 --> 45:08.760
Sure.

45:08.760 --> 45:09.960
Alex, perhaps.

45:09.960 --> 45:10.840
No, I don't get that.

45:10.840 --> 45:17.000
Well, I mean, I guess it's that kind of always getting

45:17.000 --> 45:19.120
to that conversation of like, you guys just

45:19.120 --> 45:21.160
don't realize because you think you're

45:21.160 --> 45:22.920
going to be the mine owner.

45:22.920 --> 45:25.280
You don't think that you're going

45:25.280 --> 45:27.960
to be under a different boot.

45:27.960 --> 45:30.480
You think it's going to be some sort of utopia

45:30.480 --> 45:33.400
where you get to do whatever you want to do,

45:33.400 --> 45:36.080
and all you're doing is establishing someone else

45:36.080 --> 45:38.680
to fuck you over, probably worse.

45:38.680 --> 45:44.120
Yeah, and it's also, there were logistical reasons

45:44.120 --> 45:48.160
in a disconnected world why the Civil War in the United

45:48.160 --> 45:50.880
States in the 1860s didn't really

45:50.880 --> 45:54.560
lead to the complete destruction of America.

45:54.560 --> 45:55.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:55.360 --> 45:58.440
We're another Civil War to break out today.

45:58.440 --> 46:01.280
It's not like what this fantasy is, where it's like,

46:01.280 --> 46:03.920
one side will fight the other, and then someone will win,

46:03.920 --> 46:04.680
and then America.

46:04.680 --> 46:07.120
There are no battlefields anymore in the States.

46:07.120 --> 46:10.400
No, but were there to be an actual Civil War,

46:10.400 --> 46:13.200
do you think that that would work

46:13.200 --> 46:18.080
for the other global powers that are tied up in our economy?

46:18.080 --> 46:18.880
Well.

46:18.880 --> 46:19.680
It wouldn't work.

46:19.680 --> 46:23.360
I imagine that China and Europe now,

46:23.360 --> 46:27.240
naturally they do have a massive investment in the United States

46:27.240 --> 46:29.520
continuing to function the same way.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.400
I imagine they would stand on the sidelines

46:31.400 --> 46:33.960
if all of the sudden the global economy were to crash.

46:33.960 --> 46:34.760
Let's see who wins.

46:34.760 --> 46:39.280
Because two groups of morons were dressed in red and blue

46:39.280 --> 46:43.320
on fucking a plane running at each other with knives.

46:43.320 --> 46:44.000
Oh, no.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.320
We need the economy and the entire world

46:46.320 --> 46:47.320
to get back online.

46:47.320 --> 46:49.280
We better pull for the boogaloos.

46:49.280 --> 46:52.000
Yeah, no chance.

46:52.000 --> 46:57.160
There's far ranging consequences from this sort

46:57.160 --> 47:01.240
of fantastical idea that they have.

47:01.240 --> 47:02.920
It was one of the reasons why I have

47:02.920 --> 47:06.680
a real lack of interest in accelerationist ideas

47:06.680 --> 47:09.360
is like, anyway, I really don't care.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.880
I don't care for this guy's kind of ideology.

47:11.880 --> 47:13.640
And I also don't take him at face value

47:13.640 --> 47:16.920
about the non-discrimination.

47:16.920 --> 47:18.480
Maybe him personally, I don't know.

47:18.480 --> 47:20.800
I don't know anything about him as an individual

47:20.800 --> 47:24.960
except for what he's put out on Vice and shit.

47:24.960 --> 47:28.120
But I don't know.

47:28.120 --> 47:31.120
Yeah, I find it hard to believe how many people still believe

47:31.120 --> 47:35.960
that a civil war in the United States

47:35.960 --> 47:41.880
would have two armies opposed to each other with two generals

47:41.880 --> 47:44.880
all choosing which troops to put where,

47:44.880 --> 47:47.040
as opposed to either being like, there's

47:47.040 --> 47:49.680
no middle ground in a war in the United States.

47:49.680 --> 47:53.680
It's either street battles in every United States city

47:53.680 --> 47:57.400
or explosions everywhere.

47:57.400 --> 48:01.000
There's no just, we're going to go fight.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.800
And you know the quickest way to get the UN here too

48:03.800 --> 48:05.120
is probably that.

48:05.120 --> 48:06.400
Yes.

48:06.400 --> 48:07.920
Get the UN involved.

48:07.920 --> 48:08.520
Oh, man.

48:08.520 --> 48:09.760
I'm sure Alex would love that.

48:09.760 --> 48:11.680
Yeah, it'd be great.

48:11.680 --> 48:18.680
So Mike and Alex get to talking about how Alex's ideas are

48:18.680 --> 48:21.880
kind of behind what Mike is doing.

48:21.880 --> 48:24.680
And Alex has a really tough time with this.

48:24.680 --> 48:26.720
I'm just trying to figure out, are these,

48:26.720 --> 48:28.440
because you mentioned this.

48:28.440 --> 48:31.480
And you respond to the 1776 thing

48:31.480 --> 48:33.720
because I'm somebody that's very clear that I believe

48:33.720 --> 48:36.160
in civil disobedience.

48:36.160 --> 48:40.720
I believe in defensive defense and violence.

48:40.720 --> 48:43.240
I really want to fix this peacefully.

48:43.240 --> 48:44.760
In fact, let's just go there first.

48:44.760 --> 48:47.480
You're saying listening to my work, my energy,

48:47.480 --> 48:50.800
you're taking from that the idea of revolution or armed

48:50.800 --> 48:51.640
conflict?

48:51.640 --> 48:52.400
Yeah, no shit.

48:52.400 --> 48:54.160
I definitely wouldn't say that I took it directly from you.

48:54.160 --> 48:56.720
I'm just saying that the idea that you portray

48:56.720 --> 48:59.200
and the message that you carry sometimes

48:59.200 --> 49:02.600
tend to look like you're just there to create merch

49:02.600 --> 49:07.080
and not actually stand for an actual revolution.

49:07.080 --> 49:09.760
You talk about peaceful protesting.

49:09.760 --> 49:12.680
And I always thought, the Alex Jones I listened to growing up

49:12.680 --> 49:15.560
was someone who wanted the government to fear the people.

49:15.560 --> 49:19.160
And so I'm not saying that you incited it or you directed it.

49:19.160 --> 49:23.160
But I am saying that if you continue to preach a 1776

49:23.160 --> 49:25.920
revolution or the type of message that you preach,

49:25.920 --> 49:28.960
you're going to have to figure out whether you're just

49:28.960 --> 49:30.480
going to bend the knee and continue

49:30.480 --> 49:32.160
to make your talk show or if you're actually

49:32.160 --> 49:35.680
going to stand against the tyranny that is present in the US.

49:35.680 --> 49:38.560
Well, Mike, let's be 100% clear.

49:38.560 --> 49:41.240
You better believe I sell t-shirts and I sell product.

49:41.240 --> 49:43.400
That gets the word out, that's dedication.

49:43.400 --> 49:44.480
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

49:44.480 --> 49:45.760
They want to shut us down.

49:45.760 --> 49:46.960
They want to kill our speech.

49:46.960 --> 49:49.520
They want us to exercise our speech online.

49:49.520 --> 49:53.000
You guys wear your shirts that are Hawaiian shirts,

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
to see them being owned.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.160
We're info wars.

49:55.160 --> 49:57.080
And damn right, I've got the globalists

49:57.080 --> 49:58.200
trying to shut me down.

49:58.200 --> 49:59.680
I am a capitalist.

49:59.680 --> 50:03.400
I didn't get $10.6 billion from Democrat donors

50:03.400 --> 50:05.160
and George Soros like Black Lives Matter.

50:05.160 --> 50:09.520
So I don't get any funding like Antifa or a BLM.

50:09.520 --> 50:11.600
I don't have people volunteering to do my security.

50:11.600 --> 50:12.560
I pay my security.

50:12.560 --> 50:15.000
I don't have the Boogaloo boys volunteering for my security.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.240
I pay for my security.

50:16.240 --> 50:17.920
So I mean, I'm a capitalist.

50:17.920 --> 50:19.840
I am not ashamed of selling products.

50:19.840 --> 50:22.800
But to be clear, if we get to a point

50:22.800 --> 50:25.120
where I think I've got to be violent,

50:25.120 --> 50:26.400
then I'll do what I have to do.

50:26.400 --> 50:28.200
That's why I'm fighting so hard.

50:28.200 --> 50:29.040
That's why I'm fighting so hard.

50:29.040 --> 50:30.840
Because I'm not going to stand around in capitals with guns

50:30.840 --> 50:31.520
if I get violent.

50:31.520 --> 50:34.920
Yeah, if Alex gets violent, he's going to have suction cups

50:34.920 --> 50:38.560
on his hands, skiggling up the side of a building.

50:38.560 --> 50:41.360
Alex Jones is going to be a commando,

50:41.360 --> 50:45.240
breaking into Soros's house with piano wire.

50:45.240 --> 50:48.320
Now, we all know Alex is a paratrooper.

50:48.320 --> 50:49.800
He's going to get in that parachute,

50:49.800 --> 50:52.120
and he's going to land directly on top of the catapult

50:52.120 --> 50:54.600
building, repel his way down.

50:54.600 --> 50:56.040
I know one thing about Alex Jones,

50:56.040 --> 50:59.320
and that is he is a man who is not unfamiliar with stealth.

50:59.320 --> 51:01.560
Yeah.

51:01.560 --> 51:06.720
Hey, hey, hey, where's my enemies?

51:06.720 --> 51:07.640
I'm a little drunk.

51:07.640 --> 51:09.920
Yeah, that's a little silly.

51:09.920 --> 51:12.400
I do think that Mike has a decent point,

51:12.400 --> 51:16.360
though, that Alex, the way he engages with his rhetoric

51:16.360 --> 51:19.160
and the way he behaves on air, does lead to a point

51:19.160 --> 51:21.960
where he has to be honest with himself.

51:21.960 --> 51:24.120
Am I just being a talk show host,

51:24.120 --> 51:27.880
or am I actually trying to rile people up to 1776?

51:27.880 --> 51:30.120
And we've heard Alex, when shit gets too hot, he's like,

51:30.120 --> 51:31.400
I'm just a talk show host, man.

51:31.400 --> 51:31.920
Right.

51:31.920 --> 51:33.800
You know, Shadow Gate comes out, he's like,

51:33.800 --> 51:35.080
I don't do any of this shit.

51:35.080 --> 51:37.560
Yeah, when the country is stable,

51:37.560 --> 51:40.240
or at least more stable than it is now,

51:40.240 --> 51:43.800
you can get away with the answer to 1984 is 1776.

51:43.800 --> 51:46.440
Everybody gets that it's a metaphor.

51:46.440 --> 51:49.880
Now, it's not a metaphor.

51:49.880 --> 51:50.480
It's not.

51:50.480 --> 51:54.160
You can't say it without meaning it, because it's happening.

51:54.160 --> 51:56.720
Yeah, and your use of it as a metaphor

51:56.720 --> 52:00.640
is part of what normalizes the state that we're in now,

52:00.640 --> 52:05.840
in the same way that Mimi jokes about civil war

52:05.840 --> 52:09.720
to electric boogaloo leads to people actually wanting

52:09.720 --> 52:13.160
to engage in ways that could set off a second civil war.

52:13.160 --> 52:15.480
Like, jokes can lead to action.

52:15.480 --> 52:19.600
And hey, maybe jokes were fine then, but not now.

52:19.600 --> 52:23.120
We can't do this like, no, no, no, what I really meant was,

52:23.120 --> 52:27.080
no, be specific, be careful in your language,

52:27.080 --> 52:30.760
and make sure that everybody is fucking trying, at least.

52:30.760 --> 52:31.800
It would be helpful.

52:31.800 --> 52:34.840
And instead, it's just like, oh, no, no, I didn't mean that.

52:34.840 --> 52:36.520
Well, guess what?

52:36.520 --> 52:41.120
Hundreds of thousands of people are ready for 1776,

52:41.120 --> 52:42.120
maybe millions.

52:42.120 --> 52:43.800
And they're surprised that you're not.

52:43.800 --> 52:44.480
Exactly.

52:44.480 --> 52:44.760
Yeah.

52:44.760 --> 52:45.320
Yeah, yeah.

52:45.320 --> 52:47.200
So now, this is the point in the interview

52:47.200 --> 52:49.720
where I think Alex realizes, uh-oh, I

52:49.720 --> 52:51.480
better be mean to this guy.

52:51.480 --> 52:53.600
I've got to condescend to him.

52:53.600 --> 52:55.000
How do you see this thing unfold?

52:55.000 --> 52:58.040
And tell me, General George Washington 2.0,

52:58.040 --> 53:00.720
how we're going to do this revolution.

53:00.720 --> 53:01.280
I don't know.

53:01.280 --> 53:03.880
I thought you were the General George Washington 2.0.

53:03.880 --> 53:04.480
And, of course.

53:04.480 --> 53:05.840
No, no, no, I'm not the guy out there

53:05.840 --> 53:07.520
saying we're going to have a revolution.

53:07.520 --> 53:08.520
So tell me.

53:08.520 --> 53:10.720
We need a declaration of independence by the states.

53:10.720 --> 53:12.280
We need a coalition of leaders ready

53:12.280 --> 53:14.280
with a bill of particulars of what we want.

53:14.280 --> 53:15.760
And then we go to war.

53:15.760 --> 53:18.000
Not a bunch of people taking selfies in the Capitol.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.160
That's the opposite of what we need.

53:19.160 --> 53:20.080
We need George Washington.

53:20.080 --> 53:21.160
He hadn't shown up yet.

53:21.160 --> 53:25.480
So I'm telling you, tell me what we do, General Dunn.

53:25.480 --> 53:27.960
What do we do right now?

53:27.960 --> 53:28.800
Go for it.

53:28.800 --> 53:30.880
Get those papers in order.

53:30.880 --> 53:33.120
Get the plan of government for after in order.

53:33.120 --> 53:35.120
And actually get it done and start building forces

53:35.120 --> 53:37.680
like you're supposed to, like all of us had done.

53:37.680 --> 53:40.560
I think that Alex thought he'd be cowed by that yelling.

53:40.560 --> 53:42.800
I think that he thought he'd be intimidated by Alex

53:42.800 --> 53:43.800
doing a little outburst.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.680
See, look at how stupid this is.

53:45.680 --> 53:47.200
You don't have a plan in place.

53:47.200 --> 53:48.760
OK, well, let's get a plan in place

53:48.760 --> 53:50.320
and take over the government.

53:50.320 --> 53:51.680
Oh, no.

53:51.680 --> 53:53.640
Oh, I thought you were just going to be stupid.

53:53.640 --> 53:56.720
Mike is saying, essentially, my part in this

53:56.720 --> 53:59.800
is rising up people.

53:59.800 --> 54:01.680
And that is what I have been doing.

54:01.680 --> 54:02.560
Great.

54:02.560 --> 54:04.600
We need those bills of particulars.

54:04.600 --> 54:06.040
Why the fuck isn't anyone doing it?

54:06.040 --> 54:07.040
Why are you doing it?

54:07.040 --> 54:07.520
Yeah.

54:07.520 --> 54:08.760
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

54:08.760 --> 54:09.320
Yeah.

54:09.320 --> 54:11.840
No, he was like, I guess.

54:11.840 --> 54:13.120
Alex is in a bad place.

54:13.120 --> 54:17.440
I guess Alex was expecting him to reveal himself as stupid

54:17.440 --> 54:20.880
and reveal that, look at all your stupid ideas that

54:20.880 --> 54:22.240
don't make any sense.

54:22.240 --> 54:24.280
And then when he didn't reveal himself as stupid,

54:24.280 --> 54:26.520
he has to try and portray him as stupid.

54:26.520 --> 54:30.920
And now he realizes that it's impenetrable.

54:30.920 --> 54:33.000
You know, like, this is a generation

54:33.000 --> 54:36.320
that's been raised on my generation's irony.

54:36.320 --> 54:37.560
They're indestructible.

54:37.560 --> 54:39.960
Well, it's impenetrable for Alex also,

54:39.960 --> 54:42.800
because the only way to penetrate it

54:42.800 --> 54:48.440
is to sort of also puncture your own mythology

54:48.440 --> 54:51.360
and your own worldview.

54:51.360 --> 54:54.280
Were you to say, like, well, all this stuff that we complain

54:54.280 --> 54:55.680
about is bullshit.

54:55.680 --> 54:59.160
So the reason that you want the bill of particulars

54:59.160 --> 55:02.240
and a new government and all this is nonsense.

55:02.240 --> 55:06.040
It's all lies that we've been spouting for years on the radio.

55:06.040 --> 55:08.520
Now, you could do that, and then it

55:08.520 --> 55:11.040
would devolve into a completely different conversation.

55:11.040 --> 55:13.200
But Alex can't do that.

55:13.200 --> 55:15.880
Mike is essentially bulletproof on a lot of points,

55:15.880 --> 55:18.800
because he's talking to Alex, who he clearly

55:18.800 --> 55:22.400
knows profits from putting on a certain presentation.

55:22.400 --> 55:24.760
And he would stand to lose those profits

55:24.760 --> 55:27.640
if he were to do the thing that would

55:27.640 --> 55:29.120
deflate this conversation.

55:29.120 --> 55:30.560
Yeah, I don't know why people who

55:30.560 --> 55:33.840
are going to absolutely beat the shit out of Alex

55:33.840 --> 55:36.680
in an interview do not bring a hype man.

55:36.680 --> 55:38.720
So many different lines in there,

55:38.720 --> 55:40.720
he said, where somebody should be on the call

55:40.720 --> 55:42.440
to just be like, what?

55:42.440 --> 55:44.600
I cannot believe you just did that.

55:44.600 --> 55:45.880
Yeah.

55:45.880 --> 55:47.520
And this would be a good place for it,

55:47.520 --> 55:49.840
actually, because in this next clip,

55:49.840 --> 55:52.640
Mike kind of chews Alex out a little bit.

55:52.640 --> 55:54.480
We go to our capitals on where they say,

55:54.480 --> 55:57.200
you know, in Richmond, Virginia, Owen Troyer drove there.

55:57.200 --> 55:58.640
He saw some of my guys there on.

55:58.640 --> 56:00.480
They said, hey, you can't open carry here anymore.

56:00.480 --> 56:01.520
It's illegal now.

56:01.520 --> 56:02.760
We went and we disobeyed it.

56:02.760 --> 56:04.040
If they had tried to arrest us, we

56:04.040 --> 56:05.280
would have used the Second Amendment the way

56:05.280 --> 56:06.600
that it was intended, which is to limit government.

56:06.600 --> 56:06.800
Hold on.

56:06.800 --> 56:07.440
Say that again.

56:07.440 --> 56:08.640
Where did you do this?

56:08.640 --> 56:10.080
Because this is you putting your money where your mouth is.

56:10.080 --> 56:10.560
Where did you do this?

56:10.560 --> 56:11.480
Caravan.

56:11.480 --> 56:12.720
This is in Richmond, Virginia.

56:12.720 --> 56:15.720
It's illegal to open carry any protest or event armed.

56:15.720 --> 56:18.080
So we go there for Owen Troyer's thing

56:18.080 --> 56:19.920
when he came through with the Stop the Steal.

56:19.920 --> 56:21.240
We've been at every protest, whether it

56:21.240 --> 56:23.120
be MAGA, Black Lives Matter, anything,

56:23.120 --> 56:26.160
to make sure that things are peaceful and respectful.

56:26.160 --> 56:27.200
And we go there armed.

56:27.200 --> 56:28.400
We disobeyed the law.

56:28.400 --> 56:29.960
We stand against the tyranny.

56:29.960 --> 56:32.320
And what we see, people like you, Alex,

56:32.320 --> 56:35.560
who used to be my hero as a young man,

56:35.560 --> 56:37.640
we see young men in the need to it repeatedly.

56:37.640 --> 56:38.960
You have your talk shows.

56:38.960 --> 56:39.640
You give your speeches.

56:39.640 --> 56:41.120
But y'all don't actually stand against tyranny.

56:41.120 --> 56:43.600
And that's disheartening as a young man, a young American,

56:43.600 --> 56:45.880
and someone involved in the liberty movement

56:45.880 --> 56:47.280
and constitutionalism.

56:47.280 --> 56:48.520
Personally, I'm not speaking for the young man.

56:48.520 --> 56:49.320
Wait a minute.

56:49.320 --> 56:50.920
How am I not standing against tyranny,

56:50.920 --> 56:54.120
fighting evil legislation, marching, going out

56:54.120 --> 56:55.160
and having events?

56:55.160 --> 56:57.200
Sorry?

56:57.200 --> 56:58.360
Because you talk.

56:58.360 --> 56:59.080
We go out there.

56:59.080 --> 57:00.160
We actually disobey.

57:00.160 --> 57:01.360
We stand there armed.

57:01.360 --> 57:02.200
We're not willing to.

57:02.200 --> 57:05.480
We don't boot lick like a lot of you and Republicans do.

57:05.480 --> 57:08.320
We actually stand up against the tyranny that is prevalent.

57:08.320 --> 57:09.480
That's what I want to see y'all do.

57:09.480 --> 57:11.800
When you ask, well, what's the revolution look like?

57:11.800 --> 57:12.600
Well, there you go.

57:12.600 --> 57:14.400
It's us engaging in civil disobedience.

57:14.400 --> 57:16.520
And if they decide to do something,

57:16.520 --> 57:17.720
then we'll stand against that.

57:17.720 --> 57:20.040
You're not going out there where they say, hey,

57:20.040 --> 57:21.200
you can't open carry here.

57:21.200 --> 57:22.760
You can't exercise a constitutional right.

57:22.760 --> 57:24.280
You're not going out there and disobey it.

57:24.280 --> 57:25.520
Y'all want to do everything by the law

57:25.520 --> 57:27.240
because you're the party of law and order.

57:27.240 --> 57:29.960
Well, no, I have supported open carry.

57:29.960 --> 57:32.160
And I've supported the lawsuits and all the rest of it.

57:32.160 --> 57:33.440
So that's not a fair statement.

57:33.440 --> 57:34.840
Oh, you lost.

57:34.840 --> 57:36.600
Listen to the sound of his voice.

57:36.600 --> 57:38.000
Listen to the defeat.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.560
That was so weak.

57:40.560 --> 57:42.520
Alex cannot rebut.

57:42.520 --> 57:44.280
I went outside one time.

57:44.280 --> 57:47.080
You can honestly imagine somebody

57:47.080 --> 57:49.080
who likes Alex hearing this and it

57:49.080 --> 57:51.960
shattering some of the illusion that you have about Alex

57:51.960 --> 57:56.520
as him being a competent, confident, strong force.

57:56.520 --> 58:00.440
This guy is mirroring back a lot of Alex's rhetoric.

58:00.440 --> 58:03.400
He's pointing out the places where

58:03.400 --> 58:07.200
it's clear that Alex is in contradiction with himself.

58:07.200 --> 58:08.520
And it's, uh.

58:08.520 --> 58:11.760
And he's hammering the fact that he's in it for the merch.

58:11.760 --> 58:12.520
You talk.

58:12.520 --> 58:13.240
You talk.

58:13.240 --> 58:14.520
You talk for money.

58:14.520 --> 58:15.480
That's what you do.

58:15.480 --> 58:16.120
Yeah, you talk.

58:16.120 --> 58:17.200
We act.

58:17.200 --> 58:22.320
And that's why, you know, if there is tyranny, then.

58:22.320 --> 58:25.680
I'm halfway waiting for this to end like a Molyneux declaring

58:25.680 --> 58:28.440
himself a white nationalist where Alex is just like, well,

58:28.440 --> 58:30.320
I guess I'm a boogaloo boy, too.

58:30.320 --> 58:32.240
I didn't know it, but here we are.

58:32.240 --> 58:33.120
We'll see how it ends.

58:33.120 --> 58:33.640
Oh, god.

58:33.640 --> 58:37.160
So Alex, like you said, I mean, you could tell there was

58:37.160 --> 58:40.440
a little bit of submission there around showed ass.

58:40.440 --> 58:44.400
That like, oh, no, I've supported open carry.

58:44.400 --> 58:47.280
And so Alex has to retreat to trying to have gotcha moments.

58:47.280 --> 58:49.800
So he brings up the Capitol.

58:49.800 --> 58:53.400
The strategic blunder of rushing into the Capitol,

58:53.400 --> 58:57.120
the strategic blunder of the selfies and the cute art stuff

58:57.120 --> 58:59.640
and all the rest of it is not what Trump wanted.

58:59.640 --> 59:00.480
It's not what I wanted.

59:00.480 --> 59:02.960
That was our rally to try to put pressure on them to have

59:02.960 --> 59:04.840
a 10 day investigation of election fraud.

59:04.840 --> 59:07.240
So wait, do you think what happened to the Capitol

59:07.240 --> 59:10.440
was a victory or a fiasco?

59:10.440 --> 59:12.480
I definitely think it was the right thing

59:12.480 --> 59:13.400
for the wrong reasons.

59:13.400 --> 59:14.640
I think it was a good way to make government

59:14.640 --> 59:15.680
for the people again.

59:15.680 --> 59:18.000
It was nice to see members of Congress on their knees

59:18.000 --> 59:19.720
fearing the people.

59:19.720 --> 59:23.880
I think it was the right thing for the wrong reasons.

59:23.880 --> 59:26.440
So you now wish that people wouldn't have knocked down

59:26.440 --> 59:28.960
the doors and gone in there?

59:28.960 --> 59:31.840
I wish 100% that people would do it more all over this country

59:31.840 --> 59:33.600
and make government for the people.

59:33.600 --> 59:35.920
So that's a little bit fucked up.

59:35.920 --> 59:37.760
Yeah, yeah.

59:37.760 --> 59:41.160
Yeah, there is nothing quite so terrifying as a zealot.

59:41.160 --> 59:42.480
Especially a 20 year old.

59:42.480 --> 59:44.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:44.160 --> 59:47.320
But also I can think of a lot of historical problems

59:47.320 --> 59:49.440
that come from 20 year old zealots.

59:49.440 --> 59:54.920
He is also limiting his own personal involvement

59:54.920 --> 59:57.520
with the Capitol and the storming of it.

59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.280
There's an article in Reuters from January 8th

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:03.840
that says that Mike Dunn, quote, who lives in Virginia

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.920
said three or four groups of loyalists under his command

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.480
helped storm the Capitol this week amid a motley mix

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.760
of rioters who supported President Donald Trump's

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.680
attempt to overturn the results of the November

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.120
presidential election.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.040
While most boogaloos are libertarians

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.840
who largely oppose Trump, Dunn said

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.880
the group embraced the moment to strike against the government.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.000
So I don't know.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.960
Like, if this Reuters article is wrong?

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.120
Right.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:30.240
But he downplays his own involvement.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.560
And it seems like there might be some disingenuousness

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.760
on his part in terms of his exact actions.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:40.200
I just don't think that you can get away with commanding people

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.080
to overthrow the Capitol.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.840
It seems like this Reuters article, if true,

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:47.440
is a problem.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.360
That said, I don't know.

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.040
Yeah, that's fair.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.760
I do know that that is a point that Alex really hoped

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.880
would show some sort of weakness on Mike's part.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:05.560
But no, he stands firm to what he has a consistency.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.400
And I'm not saying that as a positive thing.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.640
No, no, no.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.520
I believe I just pointed out, zealotry, terrifying.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.960
So Owen Troyer is there, like I said.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:19.440
And he pops his little head in to say, hey, how's it going?

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.960
And then he indicates that, hey, I'm into this stuff.

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:22.680
I like it.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.600
I like it.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.360
We got to do it later.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.520
OK, all right, great.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.080
And then Alex, you could tell, is getting a little heated.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.720
There's no doubt that we have encroaching global government.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.080
There's no doubt that the government's out of control.

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.280
There's no doubt that the biggest crooks in America

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.720
are in Washington, DC.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.200
I think 90% of Americans would agree to that.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.600
Here's the problem, though.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.400
And Mike, I'd like to get your response to this.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:51.080
We're not in a 1776 colonists versus the British government

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.680
time, where we're hiding in the woods.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.440
And we've got the local communities.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.980
And they don't have a world technocracy set up against us,

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.640
or a federal government set up against us.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.920
I mean, I've been to jail multiple times

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:03.720
for my free speech.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.680
You know that.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.040
So I mean, to sit here and say.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.720
Oh, you've done nothing because you didn't stand around

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.080
in a Hawaiian shirt with a gun.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.200
Whoa.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.160
All right, Alex.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.280
All right, I'm not going to just let these two young dick

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.680
wads talk around me without me asserting some dominance.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.000
And Alex is being a real dick.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:19.560
I mean, like.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:21.400
Absolutely.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.800
I'm not going to sit here and like feel bad, too bad for Mike.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:28.000
But like, you know, I can tell he's being rude.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Alex is being rude.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.920
I am not winning the war of ideas somehow.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.200
Alex invited this guy to be on his show.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.480
And now he's just being a dick to him because he's

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.480
failed to take the upper ground in this argument.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.880
As usual, he's pouting and he's throwing a fit.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:44.600
Yeah.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.560
And in this next clip, again, we return to this theme.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.960
It's like, if you were real, you would kill my enemies.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:55.280
But I'm telling you that the target, if Boogaloo's are real.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.480
I'm not saying do this.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.840
But if you really want a violent revolution,

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.960
you should be calling for the Council on Foreign Relations.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:02.000
Every member should be in a deck of cards,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.240
the whole leadership, Richard and Haas, all the rest of them.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.840
And the last thing I want is anything

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.240
to happen to Bill Gates or Richard and Haas or any of them.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.400
I'm just saying, if you really want to do this,

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.440
Klaus Schwab should be the ace of spades.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.320
And then Bill Gates is, you know, right after that.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.640
OK, I'm just telling you, man, you're hitting the wrong target.

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:21.320
Oh, boy.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:28.360
So you are not endorsing him.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:32.880
But you are saying, if you take out my targets, I like you.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.520
I will consider you real.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.680
You'll be real.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.000
Yeah, you wouldn't be you wouldn't be suspected

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.200
of being SPLC, ADL-run false flaggers

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.560
if only you did kill Richard and Haas.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.200
Listen, I'm not telling you that I want anything bad

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.280
to happen to Bill Gates.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.280
But, you know.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:59.600
But I am going to use the same sort of visual metaphor

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.760
that was used in the War on Terror, Saddam Hussein.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:08.200
Hey, hey, you know, you said, I asked you

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.480
what the plan was.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.320
And you came back with, it should be my idea.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.600
And my idea is that you should take out these targets.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.840
Oh, shit, I'm in it, aren't I?

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:16.640
Oh, no.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.440
Fuck.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.800
So Alex comes back from break.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.600
They're talking.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.360
And now the Proud Boys, under the bus,

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:28.800
does not look like they're going to be heroes.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.800
Oh, god.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.800
Although Alex is walking a little bit of a fine line

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.080
with this.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:32.600
Because he's not.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.600
He's saying that he still supports the Proud Boys

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.440
and what have you.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.480
He is a Proud Boy.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.320
He's now lumping them in with forces

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.000
that might have acted no good.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.200
Sure.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.120
I'm not an informant like Enrique Tarrio.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.880
But at the same time, I want to expose the federal forces that

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.320
are involved in this.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.880
We identified Boogaloos.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.720
And we identified Proud Boys leading the attack

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.080
on the capital of Antifa.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.720
And I'm now bringing all this out today.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.960
I was already intending to before this broke about Tarrio.

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:00.400
Sure.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.360
So.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.000
And we have the footage.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.880
So no Boogaloos win the capital.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.600
Put it up of a Boogaloo boy walking into the capital.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.280
And I will.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.640
Hold on, they have their faces covered.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.040
But I mean, well, we got you saying

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.680
you have fire teams inside the capital.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.320
But I'm going to ask you right now.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:17.800
Building.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.200
You said we're inside the capital.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.320
You said that doesn't mean what you said.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:23.520
DC is the capital, not the capital building.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.320
Capital building.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.400
Oh, DC is the capital.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.400
Oh, OK.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.600
Oops.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.160
Alex's big gotcha is a tweet.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.600
Or maybe it was a post on Parler.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.120
I'm not sure.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.960
But it's Mike saying that they have four fire

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.640
teams at the capital.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.600
Right.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.760
With an A.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:39.640
Well, I don't know.

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.960
I didn't actually see the tweet.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.600
But it makes sense that his explanation

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:46.960
is we met the country's capital, not the building.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.560
Sir, sir, there are two words.

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.800
I know they are homophones.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.160
They sound the same.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.880
Yeah, so Alex thinks that's a big gotcha

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.720
because you have four teams inside the building.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.320
We were talking about Bain Capital.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.880
We went to the wrong building.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.160
I am really sorry about that.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.440
You see how quickly that gets resolved.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.360
He's like, I was talking about the city.

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.040
Yeah.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:07.640
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:08.920
And he was curt about it, too.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.200
He didn't try and dissemble.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.960
He was just like, there's a difference!

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.360
Yeah.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:12.840
Yeah.

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.040
And so this isn't going well.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.960
But Alex has blamed the Boogaloos

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:20.560
as being the people who were the ones who had the zip ties.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.680
And they were the ones who were the actual really scary folks

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.960
in the storming of the capital.

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.080
They weren't the patriots.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:29.000
And Alex has said that he's proved these things.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:29.600
Yes, he has.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.400
He's not just saying, I think it's them.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.240
Pictures of you.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:35.720
Now, because this interview isn't going well,

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.760
Alex kind of reveals that I'm just

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.400
looking for someone to blame.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.800
And I decided it was you.

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.440
Here's the deal.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.240
We're going to find out who these guys were

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.800
in camo that had masks on.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:49.240
And we think they work for the FBI, OK?

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.240
Because our president that really got elected

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.960
is on trial in a week and a half.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.560
And we're pissed off about it, OK?

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.000
And we wanted to put peaceful pressure on them

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.160
to show our numbers.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.440
And we got screwed over by some people.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.080
We're going to find out who they are.

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.720
You hear the headlines.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:04.720
Oh, boy.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.600
Oh, great.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.320
Yeah.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.160
That is not what someone would say

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.360
if they've proved something.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.920
No, no.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:11.440
Nope.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.640
I have proven it's the Bugalo Boys.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.480
And we are going to find out who did it.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:16.840
And I think they work for the FBI.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.360
I'm pretty sure it was the FBI.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.760
We don't know who these people are, but we think they're FBI.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:21.880
We're going to find out.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.560
We're going to get to the bottom of this.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:26.680
Hey, Mike, have I ever told you about how I'm a psychic based

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:29.800
on people's posture?

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.160
It's like a body language expert,

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.160
but I can tell from still photographs.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.440
Also, by the way, God gave me a vision

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.600
30 years ago that laid all of this out for me.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.840
Mike, you're not really fitting into this vision.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:41.600
I'm confused.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:45.280
Mike, I think you might be working for the devil, Mike.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.320
You're the devil, Mike.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.960
Mike.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.840
See, now, I don't understand why he

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.920
doesn't end every interview that doesn't go well with like,

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.200
well, obviously, you're working for the devil, sir.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.880
And I must have you off my show.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.880
Obviously, this is a challenge that the devil

01:07:58.880 --> 01:07:59.680
has thrown my way.

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.360
And I decide to rise above it.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.160
Click.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.120
Pass.

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.280
Pass.

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:08.720
The devil took Jesus into the desert for 40 days and 40

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.360
nights, and on night one, Jesus said, nah, I'm out.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:15.440
Did you know that the devil is actually a booger boy?

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.280
I did not know that.

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.000
Alex proved that.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:17.600
That's fair.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.240
So like I said, Alex has claimed that he's

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.600
proved all these things.

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.160
When he's talking about it on his show,

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:26.080
it's not like spitballing ideas.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.000
It's talking about we have definitive proof,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.600
sources have confirmed.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:31.600
We have the documents.

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:35.800
Everything that it was, Antifa and Boogaloo Boys.

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:36.480
It's all there.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:40.120
And some Q folks got tricked into going and taking selfies.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.880
And the Patriots were doing the right thing.

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.120
They were fighting off Antifa.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.600
But they didn't actually go into the, yeah.

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:45.800
They were trying to fight off Antifa.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:46.320
Oh, that's right.

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.600
They're fighting off Antifa.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.960
But they got overwhelmed.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:49.640
Oh, yeah.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:50.640
Yeah.

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.120
So when you hear a clip like this,

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.800
it's just like, this is not, this is incongruous.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.800
We're trying to find out who the bravacaturgrips are.

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.000
And I'll just say it.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:00.840
And I've said this.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.360
I'm not against the Proud Boys.

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:03.360
They've been lied about.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.480
I don't think they're racist, all the other stuff.

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:08.040
We know Proud Boys not wearing their outfits,

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.760
not wearing their uniforms, that were

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.280
part of the Capitol breach.

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.080
We have tweets by you and by other people

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.120
saying they supported the Capitol attack

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.040
and that it was a great thing.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.800
Now you're kind of halfway backing off of that.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.160
What?

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.480
I'm not here trying to get you arrested.

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.000
Like who?

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.360
My big question is, I see this Dr. Gold lady just

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.520
going in being arrested.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:32.440
I see Brandon Straka, or Strak, being arrested when he

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.200
was just there doing nothing.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.360
And then it freaks me out.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:35.720
Interesting way of putting that.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.040
Like who are the men in uniforms with masks

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:41.360
handing out clubs saying, attack, attack, attack.

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:42.640
That's my big question.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.520
So Alex, if he knew what was going on

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.800
and he had the information that he claims to,

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.640
he would not be trying to figure out

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.400
who the provacaturgrips are.

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:53.960
He would not be having the alleged leader

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:56.600
of the Boogaloo's on and being like, well,

01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:00.240
we're just trying to spitball and figure out who did what.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.080
Also, there's video of Brandon Straka

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.160
citing a crowd to steal a cop's shield.

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.680
All he was doing was nothing.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.400
He's just not, he wasn't doing anything.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.680
He posted a video of himself yelling, take his shield.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:15.320
That's barely anything.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:20.400
What if, look, if he was in my hometown, Princeton, Illinois,

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.920
nobody would be bothered by it.

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.680
Right, but then they did take a guy's shield.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.480
OK, well, now there is that.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.160
There is that.

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:28.760
That's hard to, I understand cause and effect.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.600
Brandon Straka's going to prison.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.600
I'm telling you, you know, cause and effect

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.000
is really just the way we perceive

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.240
entropy in the universe.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.000
So this has already happened.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:37.480
Yeah.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.240
Yeah.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.560
And I think that at this point in the interview,

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.760
you can really tell that Alex is done.

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:44.960
He's been defeated.

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.040
He doesn't have the energy.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.000
It's just no good.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:48.800
Too young.

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.920
You can see, Mike Dunn, where I'm a little concerned

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:52.960
and I see this going on.

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.480
I'm worried about the idea of your movement

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.160
that anybody can say they're a Boogaloo.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.600
It's like, are you for anonymous?

01:10:58.600 --> 01:10:59.680
Well, anybody can be anonymous.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:00.440
Are you for Q?

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:03.720
Anybody can be for Q. I mean, don't you worry that.

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.560
For Infowars.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.760
Are you for Antifa?

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.160
But explain to me Boogaloo, where it came from.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.440
Are you worried about being taken over?

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:13.400
I mean, what do you think's really happening here?

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.320
Since Boogaloo is an ideology, it's

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.440
not necessarily a worry of being taken over

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.720
because if somebody doesn't embody the ideology,

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.120
then they're not Boogaloo.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:24.440
Boogaloo started as a meme, a joke back in like 2012.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.200
It was just an online joke.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:29.000
And then in 2019, several people started

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
making it a little more public and actually turned it

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.760
to an ideology or belief that liberty is for all

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.280
and we're done being tread on.

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.920
Yeah, and it's a joke meme that turned it

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.600
to an ideology about the need for a second Civil War.

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:47.640
So I don't think we can sort of eliminate that and pretend

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.640
that that's not a piece of this.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.920
I think that's fairly important.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.000
But Alex signaling defeat there and just being like,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
well, you know, look, I'm just trying to tell you

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.800
that your group can be co-opted.

01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.640
That is an attempt at a trick.

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:06.040
That is a false move backwards into a pose of submission.

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.560
It's a sidestep, more like.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:15.040
Yes, because then Alex tries to get him to sort of what's

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:15.760
it called?

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.840
What's the pleading the fifth?

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:18.600
Incriminate.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.960
Yes, self-incriminate.

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.880
Alex is trying to get him to self-incriminate.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:22.680
Great.

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.960
Yeah, look, look, here's my issue.

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.560
Are you guys putting on a manifesto of targets

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:33.840
because, you know, random police, capitals, that's

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.160
I mean, that's just a seat of what the people should

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.320
be in control of.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.200
I mean, I'm not calling for targets, God forbid.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.760
I don't want any violence.

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:41.800
What about Bill Gates?

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.400
What about Ted Turner?

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.480
What people trying to put poison vaccines in us?

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.920
What about the UN?

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.840
So tell me, tell me in a deck of cards

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.600
like Saddam Hussein was the top target, 2003.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.280
Like, who's the ace of spades for you guys?

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:57.760
It would be ignorant to sit here and release a manifesto

01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:58.880
or say this is a target.

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:01.720
Yeah, so let's not mention any real evil kingpins, right?

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.600
I'm not going to allow you to be in the same,

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.560
something like that.

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.080
Say that again?

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.720
I'm not going to allow you to go be in the same,

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:09.720
something like that.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.360
That would be ridiculous.

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:12.360
Oh, like the Southern Poverty Law Center

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:15.040
does posing as malicious, goading people into stuff?

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.560
Maybe you're Scott Hill.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.160
Oh, maybe.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.000
Oh, maybe I am.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.360
Oh, shit.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:24.880
Listen, what I'm telling you is I'm going to save this country.

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:25.560
OK.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.880
This is the Spider-Man meme.

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:27.360
This is.

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.080
This is the Spider-Man meme.

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.400
It's just what this is.

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.400
Oh, I'm the bad guy.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.640
No, you're the bad guy.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.280
All right, this isn't going well for me.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.840
So tell me who you want to kill on there.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:37.400
Yeah, exactly.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.800
Alex, that's a stupid idea.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:39.920
I'm not going to do that.

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.280
Oh, look at you.

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.360
Look at you.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.720
Oh, you're SPL.

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.400
That's what you are.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:46.840
Oh, my God.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:48.080
That is so funny.

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:51.760
Yeah, but I mean, like, God bless.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.280
I mean, like, God bless.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.040
I don't know how I would phrase it.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:58.000
It shows some wherewithal for Mike

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.040
to recognize, like, I'm not going to talk like this on air.

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.480
Yeah, no, I think it's a good.

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.960
I would say nice move.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:09.160
If this was Bobby Fischer versus Kasparov,

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.920
it would be like, nice move, sir.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:14.120
It would be an unnecessary error to make.

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.760
It would be a blunder, in fact, to continue the chess metaphor.

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:22.800
So Alex, I think he also makes it a little too

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:26.320
obvious in this conversation that this is personal.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.240
Like, this really feels personal.

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.560
And in this clip, Alex is going to express

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:35.040
that by way of being like, hey, I'm the real person fighting

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:39.120
for liberty, and you can prove that because a bunch of people

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.320
are suing me.

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:42.880
Is anyone suing you, Mike?

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.320
That's fair.

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:48.160
I want to save this country, and running around storming

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.800
capitals is not the way to do it.

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:53.200
Either the courts or not, Alex, the country is not safe.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.280
Let me ask you a question.

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:57.640
Do you have 50 Democratic lawsuits against you?

01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.200
What to say again?

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.680
Do you have the Democratic Party financing your destruction

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.040
like I do?

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.040
I don't know, nor do I care.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.360
I'm going to stand by what I do.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.640
No, I'm asking you, see, why am I under so much attack?

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:10.880
Because I know nothing.

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:11.800
I'm this coward.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.000
I thought it was because you were a piece of shit.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.080
I've never done anything.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.960
And you're this, because you walk around with a gun,

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.720
it's like, oh my god, I'm supposed

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.960
to fall down on my knees.

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:21.120
And like, holy hell, this is my leader.

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:23.760
I mean, seriously, you keep telling me that I stood down.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.520
You said, my generation stood down.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.120
Bull.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.560
My generation didn't stand down.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.480
It's the fact that you're doing the same thing

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.920
that's been done for years, and it's not

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:32.960
accomplishing anything.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.640
The only thing that's going to accomplish

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.800
is forcing a revolution.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.160
I am not doing the same thing.

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.520
I'm not Democrat, Republican.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.960
I'm exposing the globalist program.

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.880
Do you understand that information is powerful?

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:44.720
They're scared of it?

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:45.600
You're talking.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:46.600
That's all you're doing.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.240
You're doing the same thing that's been done for years.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:51.840
So now you are admitting you told people

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:52.680
to storm the Capitol.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:54.280
Because you're not like me, a coward.

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.040
You're a big man.

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.400
You are a woman.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.280
I have not told anybody to storm the Capitol.

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.440
I've preached revolution, and I always will.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:03.480
So Alex is trying to, again, incriminate him.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.800
He's trying to get him in this thing where it's like, oh, you

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.200
told people to storm the Capitol.

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:08.800
Because then, like, afterwards, Alex

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.640
can still use that for his narratives

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.960
if he gets him into that box.

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:12.440
Right.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:15.200
And not least of which, he wants this guy emotional.

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:15.680
Yes.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:18.960
He wants this guy to be like, no, I did tell

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.480
people to storm the Capitol.

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:22.760
Yeah, whereas there's a poise to it just being like,

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.520
no, you guys, you are engaging in the same sort of shit

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:29.680
that doesn't achieve any of the goals you profess to have,

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:32.200
and we're going to force a revolution.

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.520
Now, that idea there is the accelerationist idea.

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:41.400
The force of revolution is not something that is,

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:46.720
it's not what goes well with the public-facing idea

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:51.080
of the Boogaloo types that want you to think like, oh, we're

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.920
just here standing around making sure nothing gets out of control.

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:54.440
Right.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:55.920
It's like, no, you're there because you

01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:56.840
want to force a revolution.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:58.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.840
And you want something to go bad,

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.640
and people start shooting each other.

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:04.140
Right.

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:07.640
And I think one of the most difficult things for Alex

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:10.400
is he doesn't understand that their agenda begins

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.720
with revolution.

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:15.000
There's no, like, I don't think they

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.720
care what strikes it either.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.040
If it was a left-wing cause, they would be like,

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:22.240
yeah, let's go and the revolution

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.680
is what their goal is.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:24.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.920
So you can't really be like, oh, see, you're so stupid.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.000
And it's like, no, we just didn't succeed yet.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
The goal is still a revolution.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.640
We're not changing our goal because we lose.

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:39.880
Yeah, and I would say that based on this reporting in Reuters,

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:44.040
if accurate, is counter to what Mike

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:46.520
is presenting here on the show.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:49.160
And I have some question about that.

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.360
I don't know what the reality is.

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.760
I wasn't there.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.360
But it does seem to be like, at least a reason to be like,

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.000
I don't think that you're above board.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.080
I don't think that you're being honest here.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:05.080
Now, here's where things turn a little bit more hostile.

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.200
Alex brings up that the Boogaloo types

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:11.960
were trying to get a second march going

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:15.360
after January 6, an armed march in DC.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:21.040
Alex conflates Boogaloo types and Mike personally

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:24.320
and is accusing Mike of trying to get people

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.000
to do an armed march while they sit back and watch

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.720
the chaos happen.

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:29.520
And Mike.

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.520
Mike, you're pulling a me, right?

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.480
And Mike calls Alex a liar.

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:37.760
The Boogaloo supreme leadership, whoever they are,

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:42.240
said, go to DC the weekend after the 6 and have armed marches.

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.680
But you guys didn't show up.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.400
So you were trying to get other people to come into DC.

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.560
And she could sit back and eat popcorn and watch that.

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:51.000
Or was that not the Boogaloo that said that?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.280
It's the word you like, Alex.

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:55.800
It's called a psyop, brother.

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:56.800
Oh, a psyop.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.320
So you're not going to respond to the stack of tweets

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:01.560
I've got and messages from you saying,

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:06.120
we're going to have an armed march three days after the 6.

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.320
Yeah, Alex, you're a liar.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.200
Show the tweet where I said we're going to have an armed march.

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.200
Oh, shit.

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.560
Show the tweet where I said.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.000
So the Boogaloo's did not call.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.400
They didn't say, armed march is still on for DC.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.040
We're going to have it.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:22.040
Show the tweet where I said there's going to be an armed march.

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:23.440
I'm at the Boogaloo lordship.

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.680
Well, you said you're not the lordship.

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.440
I said I'm not the leader, correct.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.320
Oh, so you don't have any problems or anything.

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.240
Have you ever been to the ADL or Southern Poverty Law Center

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:35.560
headquarters?

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.360
I don't care to go to any of those places

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:39.120
because I can care less about them.

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:43.800
So Alex is now just like, this is falling apart.

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:45.000
Yeah.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.360
Alex was conflating other Boogaloo people

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.320
and this guy personally.

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:53.520
And this guy calls it out that you're saying that I did this.

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.080
I didn't do that.

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.840
And Alex realizes like, ah, shit.

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.920
I did just get called out on that sleight of hand.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.840
Hey, have you ever been to the SPLC Center?

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:07.160
To tangentially imply that you're an agent provocateur,

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:08.800
I'm not even going to say it.

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:12.280
I'm going to be like, hey, you ever been to these places?

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:15.160
Yeah, this is soft.

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.080
Weak tea.

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.280
Weak tea.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.520
So Alex now goes out to break and he thinks

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:20.840
he's won a little bit.

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:22.560
I think he thinks he's got some win back.

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:23.160
He's saved face.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:24.760
Because he's made some suggestion.

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:29.200
And then he also got Mike to say that an armed march on DC

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.280
a week after the storming of the Capitol

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:33.720
would be an unwise strategic move.

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.280
And somehow this is hypocritical,

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.800
although I think Alex agrees.

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:39.240
I don't know what's going on anymore.

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:41.720
I have said that no armed march in DC.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.840
And armed march in DC would be unwise.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.320
I said that repeatedly.

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:45.800
Well, good.

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:46.360
Good for you.

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.880
I remember the Boogaloo said that.

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:49.560
So wait, I thought you were a man of action, though.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:51.200
You just said that I'm the coward.

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:52.320
You're the man of action.

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.240
Wise action.

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.400
Wise action.

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.160
Wise action.

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:58.240
I go to Capitol so we can punk the police department,

01:20:58.240 --> 01:20:59.000
punk City Council.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.840
You told me earlier that we should not follow the law.

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.080
You said I'm a coward.

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.480
I follow the law.

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:07.880
You don't follow the law because you're for revolution.

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:08.360
Correct.

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.240
I am for revolution.

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.480
But I am for a wise revolution, which

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:12.760
is where we go to these capitals, we punk the PDs,

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.880
we punk the City Councils that want to make unlawful cops.

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.480
We punk the PDs.

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:18.440
Yeah, because the local cops are our issue.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.320
All right, all right.

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:22.080
Hey, you are the Boogaloo, lordship.

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:26.000
We're going to come right back if you're still here with us.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.640
You hear that laughing because Alex

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:28.800
thinks like he's got a dog.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:29.480
Got him.

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:30.160
Got him.

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.440
I finally got him.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.880
Don't think so.

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.640
Don't think you got anything there.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.040
No, I'm very bored with this conversation.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.040
I'm annoyed by it.

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:43.880
It sounds way too much like a fucking Philosophy 101

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:48.120
course where they're like, well, I'm for platonic ideals

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.080
and I'm for existentialism.

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:52.440
And it's like you're both stupid.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:53.960
I don't appreciate this.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:56.480
And this is even worse because you guys are not

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.960
arguing about philosophy.

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.600
You're like, how do we kill all these people?

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:03.760
I think that I can relate to what you're talking about

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:06.120
in that I think it's very stupid and it's a frustrating

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.640
conversation to listen to.

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.360
But I do still think that there's an importance to it.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:12.120
Oh, no, that's what I'm saying.

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:15.600
OK, well, we're talking about how to kill everyone.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.560
Right.

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.400
And you're also seeing just yet another example

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.440
of how the ecosystems that have been spawned

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:26.720
by people like Alex have now outgrown them

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:32.120
to a point where they are able to embarrass him.

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:34.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.080
The young eat the old, Dan.

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.760
It's how it's always going to go.

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.400
It does feel a bit like that.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:42.040
There is a theme of that.

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:45.400
So they come back as Mike did not

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:48.400
leave after Alex routinely insulted him and suggested

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.760
that he went to the SPLC.

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.280
Sure.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:54.480
And Mike repays the favor by blowing up

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.680
one of Alex's narratives and makes it clear that Antifa

01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.120
was not at the Capitol.

01:22:59.120 --> 01:22:59.840
Uh-oh.

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:02.520
What I said was I would not encourage an open arm march

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:05.760
on DC, which is what I've said repeatedly, because I find it

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:09.920
a poor tactical plan, a poor strategy.

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.000
So I know you like blowing things out of proportion

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.120
and trying to pay me as the bad guy or pay me as illogical.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.400
But I've been consistent with what I'm saying.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.920
You just keep trying to twist out, man.

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:19.440
No, Mike.

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:22.080
I'm trying to find out who the guys in camo

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.240
are that lead the attack with Antifa

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.880
and then get a few, maybe 100 idiots to go in with them

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:30.040
so that they can destroy the peaceful movement.

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:33.920
Look, I've been around quite a few Antifa.

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.480
There are some Antifa that are good.

01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:37.560
The majority we've not had good interactions with,

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:38.520
we do not support.

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:39.880
But there are some that are good.

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:41.560
But I've interacted with a lot of Antifa.

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.360
And I can assure you that they were not

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:46.960
Antifa that were on that front line in that Capitol riot.

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:50.120
So trying to find somebody to point fingers at,

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.680
you're failing when you're pointing at Antifa.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.480
They were not there.

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:53.400
Oh, I'm failing.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.560
Even though they arrested an Antifa leader that

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:58.480
said he brought 100 there, I saw a bunch of skinny jean guys

01:23:58.480 --> 01:23:59.240
helping do it.

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.200
Oh, so this was all Trump people.

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.720
Yeah, it's called an op, Alex, the same thing

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:06.520
that you preached about.

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:07.200
What's an op?

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.160
It's not.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:08.680
It's not.

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:10.280
It's simply not true.

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.360
Oh, so OK.

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:18.560
So should Trump be arrested for inciting this?

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:19.200
Probably.

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:20.520
I think there are a lot of other problems

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:21.480
that Trump should be arrested for.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:23.800
I don't believe he incited the insurrection at the Capitol.

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.160
No, but I believe there's a lot of other crimes

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.200
he should be arrested for.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.360
So have you ever met?

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:34.600
Have you ever talked to Southern Poverty Law Center?

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:35.560
I don't believe so.

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.840
Maybe I talk to a lot of people.

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:39.760
A lot of people call me, ask questions, reporters, agencies.

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:42.280
I have no clue.

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:44.400
Oh, and you want to put any bookends on this?

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.680
I mean, this is just a mess.

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:49.600
That's just a dude giving up.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:53.360
He asks him a second time, have you been to the SPLC?

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:53.840
Brutal.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:54.760
Talk to them.

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:57.360
And now he's just like, Owen, you got anything?

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.160
See, now that's the problem with getting

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.960
that brief moment of victory.

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:04.040
It makes the gut punch loss all the worse.

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:06.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:08.240
And Owen doesn't do much better.

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:11.240
He starts talking about now that Trump is out,

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:13.080
maybe there's some stuff we can do.

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:14.480
Now we can argue about it.

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.720
Maybe there's some stuff we can do, now we

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.600
can organize against war.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:20.040
Sure, sure.

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:20.720
Thanks, Owen.

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:24.840
And this actually brings up Mike having a decent point.

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:27.440
And that is like, you could have done that before.

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.440
We have to become unified.

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:31.480
So we can organize against the wars,

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.280
against the surveillance, against the mask,

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.640
against the forced inoculation.

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.440
I think that's a positive thing.

01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:40.520
Let me ask Lord Boogaloo, do you agree with that, Lord Boogaloo?

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:42.640
So I'm 100% clear.

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:43.720
You're cool with the tyranny.

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:46.160
It's the tyranny that you like, which would be Donald Trump.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.680
I just want to make sure I'm tracking on that.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.240
So you're not actually against tyranny.

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.800
You're not actually for revolution.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:53.240
You're only for doing it when somebody is in office

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:54.920
that you don't agree with.

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:55.680
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:57.600
I just talked about all of us unifying

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.240
against forced inoculations of Joe Biden.

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.320
Trump's gone.

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.840
You wouldn't do it like Trump was in office

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:04.280
because you didn't stand against Trump.

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:05.520
You stood for the very time.

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:06.920
Well, I didn't stand around.

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:09.800
I didn't stand around with a gun in front of stuff and say,

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:11.800
hold on now.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.880
That's another cheap shot, Mr. Fireteam.

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:17.080
We have fire teams in the Capitol.

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.040
We have taken the Capitol.

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.600
We are commando based Delta.

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.520
Come on, don't get mad, Mr. Dumb.

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.800
We're back in 60 seconds.

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.160
Alex is complaining about cheap shots

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:34.120
and he keeps calling him Lord Boogaloo and like the high master.

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:34.880
Mr. Dumb?

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:35.720
Mr. Dumb?

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:36.360
Mr. Dumb.

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.240
Oh, Mr. Dumb.

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:39.080
I thought he said Mr. Dumb.

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:40.960
No, that would have been too far.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:44.160
I was like, wow, you ended with Mr. Dumb, huh?

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.200
OK.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:50.000
But yeah, so they're talking about unity and unifying.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.400
And it's like, we can now get together with folks

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.840
and fight against the war and all this.

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:58.120
And Mike's point is pretty fair that it's like, well,

01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:01.880
you had no interest in reaching out to any other groups

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.320
when Trump was in office.

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:06.600
You weren't concerned with what inroads

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:09.400
you could make with cooperation because that's

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:10.840
the tyranny that you enjoy.

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:12.320
Yep.

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:12.800
Yeah.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.160
Which again, is a good point.

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:15.400
I don't want it coming from him.

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:16.320
No, no, no.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:22.800
He's essentially saying your belief system is incoherent

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.240
and Alex is proving it.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:27.160
And Alex is trying to say his belief system is incoherent

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:29.880
and he's proving that it's not.

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.120
They're awful.

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.760
All of them are awful.

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.880
But when you have a coherent belief system

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.680
and you are in an interview with someone who doesn't,

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:40.560
they're going to be like a wave on the mountain.

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:41.520
So you've got nothing.

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.040
Yeah.

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.520
And Alex totally misses the point

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.360
that Mike was trying to make about how like, oh, yeah,

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:49.000
all this stuff, these real problems

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.160
that you could have found common cause with some other group

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.920
that maybe you politically disagree with.

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:56.480
He had no interest in any kind of unity before,

01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:00.120
but now you do because Trump is not in office anymore.

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:02.560
He completely misses that point.

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:04.440
So the problem is, oh, and it's the same thing

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.400
I've seen with Republicans across the border,

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:10.040
people who identify as conservative or white.

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:12.360
Is that you're all for unity when it fits your idea.

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.680
You're all for, oh, let's ally with Black Lives Matter

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:15.960
or let's be friends with Black Lives Matter

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:17.840
because we got a stand against the government

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.160
because Joe Biden's in office

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.800
and his administration controls.

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:22.880
Where was that unity when Trump infringed

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.720
upon the Second Amendment?

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:25.280
But that's not fair, though.

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:26.960
That's not fair.

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.160
I didn't work with Black Lives Matter.

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:29.640
You did, Boogie Lou.

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:33.240
That's exactly the point that Mike is making.

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:34.120
Yes, exactly.

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:34.960
Yeah.

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:37.040
How can you both call for unity now

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.440
and then proudly say,

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.600
I would never work with Black Lives Matter.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:41.640
And I didn't before.

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:42.640
Exactly.

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:45.160
Because I have, wait, what was I saying?

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:47.120
And then he calls him Boogie Lou.

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.200
More pejorative.

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:53.760
So we've already seen a couple of instances

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:55.720
of Alex trying to paint Mike

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:58.800
as a Southern Poverty Law Center collaborator.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:02.160
And now Alex pulls out, he will talk to the FBI.

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:03.000
Okay.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.760
Let's ask this question of the Grand Boogaloo.

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:09.160
What comes next in the Boogaloo universe?

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.560
Or is there no, it's an ideology.

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.600
Who creates, who's the high priest?

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:14.880
Who creates the ideology?

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:17.320
Or does it just flow forth from where?

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:19.400
It's autonomous.

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:20.640
And the next thing is unity.

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:23.200
Unifying the lower bodies,

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:25.640
the people that were subject to this globalism

01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:27.960
that you speak of and this elitist mentality

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:31.840
that is running the US through our governmental officials.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:32.960
It's unifying those people

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:35.160
and getting ready to stand physically

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:37.000
to defend our rights, our life,

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.200
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:41.080
Well, I mean, I think people have a right to stand up

01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:42.200
and I think they should.

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:43.040
Let me ask you this.

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.440
Have you been contacted by the FBI?

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.880
Yes, I have.

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.600
You're not, you're not,

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.640
there's a joke in the Boogaloo that you're not Boogaloo.

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:53.320
You know, you haven't been questioned.

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:56.000
So the FBI has been all over us.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.880
So what'd the FBI say?

01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:59.320
What'd they come to you about?

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:02.760
They like asking questions, that's all.

01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:04.320
And I don't like giving them answers.

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.120
So if that paints a good picture for you, I hope it does.

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:12.200
Well, I just think what happened at the Capitol

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.760
was called screwing the pooch

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.720
and it ruined the great thing we had set up

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.320
and it gave the left a major victory.

01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:19.160
I was really hoping to blame you for it.

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:21.440
I was really hoping this interview would end up

01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.000
with me being able to blame you for it,

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.720
but you have been going circles around me.

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:28.160
I guess you're an FBI informant

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.200
or maybe you're working for the FBI.

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:31.040
I don't know.

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:32.520
You mean, just go away.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:35.480
I think Alex expected some caginess or some non-answer

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:36.760
when he asked if you've talked to the FBI.

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:37.640
Of course I have.

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:40.080
Yeah, the FBI is coming for me.

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:44.800
Duh, I'm voluntarily and loudly calling for a revolution.

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.560
Of course the FBI is coming for me.

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:48.280
I've talked to them and I stonewall them.

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:51.320
The only reason I've been murdered is because I'm white.

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:55.240
So Mike at this point has to clarify to Alex

01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:56.840
because Alex is trying to pretend

01:30:56.840 --> 01:31:00.040
that they aren't anti-globalist

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.800
because they don't target the same people

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:04.640
that Alex does and they haven't killed Bill Gates yet.

01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:06.480
And so Mike has to clarify

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:10.040
that they're opposed to the New World Order

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.920
and then this goes way off the rails.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.920
The Capitol is a symbol of us voting.

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:15.960
Just because it's been captured

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:17.560
doesn't mean we attack that.

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:18.840
The New World Order,

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.120
I'm not trying to get you to go attack people.

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:22.120
I'm just saying, if I saw a movement saying

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:24.360
we're going after Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:25.880
and the Rothschilds, the New World Order

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.560
and the CFR building in New York,

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:28.680
I'd say those guys are real.

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:30.360
They're about to get a fight.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.360
Because about 10 minutes after you said that,

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.680
they would be having the HRT SWAT teams

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:35.880
will be coming after your ass.

01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:38.600
Within a day, you're going to get a SWAT team.

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:39.880
Alex, what have I said repeatedly?

01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:41.480
I have said repeatedly that we stand against

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:42.920
the globalist and the elites

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:44.320
that continue to control this country.

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:45.160
So when you're saying,

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:47.240
oh, if I saw people that run after that,

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:48.440
we'd literally stand against it.

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:50.760
We stand against the pedophilia that's prevalent in Hollywood.

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.320
We stand against media controlling people.

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:55.080
We stand against the elitists that run our government.

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.720
We stand against the money that run our government.

01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:59.400
It's just that we're going in a slightly different way

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:00.520
than what you agree with.

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.120
All I wanted to come on here and say, Alex,

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:03.640
if you'll allow me to finish real quick,

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:05.160
all I wanted to come on here and say, man,

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:06.920
is these people out there putting in the work,

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:08.360
you know, you called them CIA ops,

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.640
you said release the boogaloo.

01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:11.080
You know, you like to make your jokes,

01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:12.520
but these people are legitimate people

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:13.400
who are putting in the work

01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.000
and believing in what they stand for.

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:16.840
There are people in the boogaloo movement

01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:18.040
who don't agree with me.

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.320
There are people in the boogaloo movement

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.520
who are different than me,

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:21.640
but these people put in works.

01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:22.600
They're not CIA ops.

01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:23.640
They don't work for the CIA.

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:25.960
They're not unwiddling CIA sources.

01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.040
And they're not controlled opposition.

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:29.880
Like sometimes you appear to be.

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:31.240
We are legitimate people who believe

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:31.960
in what we stand for.

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:32.280
That's all I want to say.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.360
Oh, I'm controlled opposition.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:36.280
There you are, Alex.

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:37.080
I'm controlled.

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.200
Who gives me my orders?

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:38.760
Please tell me.

01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:42.920
I do believe you're 100% controlled opposition, Alex.

01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:45.560
That's why you'll never preach anything

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:48.680
besides peaceful and legal, lawful,

01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:51.080
wonderful hunky dory ways of protest.

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:52.680
Okay, so I'm not the one saying

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:54.280
we got fire teams in the Capitol

01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:55.960
and then you guys haven't been indicted

01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:57.560
and then they're trying to indict me

01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:59.160
and then you're sitting there

01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:01.400
literally saying I'm getting orders

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:02.440
from a higher level group,

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:03.320
which is not the case.

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:04.520
Look at my eyes.

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.120
I take orders from God.

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:06.520
That's it.

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:07.160
You understand that?

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:10.200
You fired the one good man you had

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:11.160
and that was David Knight.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:14.040
I do believe you were controlled opposition, Alex.

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:14.600
Oh no.

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:16.280
Oh no.

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:25.560
Once again, bad HR decisions

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:28.280
come back to haunt Alex.

01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:31.880
Ah, I never thought I'd hear that said in seriousness.

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:34.760
20-year-old Boogaloo boy coming in like,

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:35.800
you're controlled opposition

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:37.160
because you fired David Knight.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.480
Oh boy, oh boy.

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:43.480
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:45.560
Oh man, if only, if only.

01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:48.120
This is the one time where if he had just listened

01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:50.440
to that Stevie P's broadcast,

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:51.720
he could have just been like,

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:54.840
Steve literally said he's been manipulating you

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.120
this entire time.

01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:56.440
Yeah.

01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:57.960
You're so easy.

01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:00.200
Of course you're controlled opposition.

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.440
Well, I mean, I don't know.

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.920
I think that the term is loaded.

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:05.960
Oh yeah, yeah, totally.

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:07.560
I wouldn't say that.

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:08.520
I'm saying from his point.

01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:09.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:11.720
I think the term controlled opposition is so loaded

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:16.520
because it implies like state control or something.

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:17.720
And I don't know.

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:19.400
I don't see compelling evidence

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:21.240
that Alex is like working for the feds

01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:22.440
or something like that.

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:26.120
But he is unreliable opposition.

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:26.620
Yeah.

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.000
Maybe not controlled opposition,

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.560
but he is a persuadable opposition.

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:32.060
Sure.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
He's influenceable by people who play games

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.560
with his ego in particular,

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.040
his sense of self-importance.

01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:46.760
Those are things that are real soft spots for him.

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:49.320
And Steve's such a good example of that.

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:49.960
Yeah.

01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:53.720
I would be interested to know if we discover a new thing

01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:54.920
that he's so weak to,

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:57.800
which is being belittled,

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:00.200
being forced to like,

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:03.240
do you think this is going to make him have to be like,

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.640
well, fine, I will act more aggressively

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:07.960
in order to look cool to these idiots?

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:08.520
I don't know.

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.600
I mean, you would think that our show

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:13.480
would be a part of his psychosis.

01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:13.960
Yeah, that's true.

01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:15.160
If that were the case.

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:15.880
That's true.

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:18.600
So I've made a career out of belittling him.

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:21.080
He's not trying to impress us.

01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.160
That's something I was thinking about.

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:23.480
Yeah.

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:26.120
One of the things that's particularly dangerous about this

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.920
or something that makes it more difficult for Alex

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:33.080
is that if he had somebody who was like an Antifa person on,

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:35.800
he could berate them and humiliate them,

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:36.840
hit the pause button.

01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:42.840
He can't really do that to somebody who has credibility

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:45.640
in the right-wing world, in quotes.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.920
Somebody who might have access to an audience

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:52.760
of right-wing people that could like Alex.

01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:57.720
Yeah, I mean, it's a weird thing to pop up into my brain,

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.760
but I was just thinking about how in World War II,

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.360
one of the big issues with the Japanese command

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:07.160
was that the higher-ups didn't want to lose face

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:09.160
in front of their subordinates.

01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:13.160
So the subordinates were driving overall policy

01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:17.000
by having this hardcore stance that was imparted upon them

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.160
by the leadership.

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:22.280
And then the leadership realizing that they were fucked

01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:25.160
couldn't then say like, okay, we're fucked

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.080
because the subordinates would be like,

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:28.920
you guys are a bunch of cowards.

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:31.560
So it created this kind of feedback loop

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:34.760
where the more extreme elements were,

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:37.400
even though ostensibly they were under the command

01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:38.360
of someone else,

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:40.840
they were the force that was driving policy at that time.

01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:42.600
That sounds like the right win.

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.960
Yeah, exactly.

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:46.760
So Alex has been called controlled opposition

01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.520
and he did not take kindly to that.

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:51.880
And this is Owen's cue to step in and cool things down.

01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:52.440
Sure.

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:56.040
And so he tries to, hey guys.

01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:57.320
Hey, we're all friends here.

01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:57.640
We all want to end up-

01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:59.320
We all want a violent revolution.

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.480
We all want to kill all of our enemies.

01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:04.760
Look, we want this, but we got to do it later.

01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:05.240
Exactly.

01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:06.040
That's his whole thing.

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:09.000
I've been arrested for my peaceful protest.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.680
I'm calling for, we have to awaken 50 million,

01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:14.840
a hundred million, 200 million Americans

01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:16.680
before you can ever even think about doing

01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:18.920
a finger lick of violence in this country

01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.200
and have a chance at victory.

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:21.560
That's all I'm saying.

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:22.360
Well, it doesn't matter.

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:23.880
We've done some good radio here

01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:25.320
and had some thought provoking things.

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:25.800
What?

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:26.760
And I'm not going to do cheap-

01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:27.880
Of all the things you've done.

01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:30.040
You're a well-spoken person and you have,

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.480
I mean, I think you believe what you're saying.

01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:34.120
And so we'll continue to watch the situation

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:34.680
as it unfolds.

01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:35.480
And I appreciate you coming up here

01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:36.760
and defending your ideas.

01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:37.640
That's all I can say.

01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:40.200
But yeah, it's pretty hilarious.

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:41.560
So I built this whole thing myself.

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.400
I did it with our listeners and I'm so proud

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:44.840
of the fact that I'm independent

01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:46.760
and I don't trust people that aren't independent.

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:47.720
And that's what we're all about.

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:48.440
You're mad.

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.960
Also, I like the idea that he's saying,

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.400
I'm not going to take cheap shots

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.560
after an hour of cheap shots.

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:56.060
Totally.

01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:59.160
I'm personally offended by him saying

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.360
that they did great radio.

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:00.760
Oh, great radio.

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:01.720
Personally offended.

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:02.440
Solid radio.

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:03.160
Absolutely.

01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:05.400
That is the least true thing either of them

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:06.680
have said this entire time.

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:08.440
Well, I will say that as somebody

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:10.600
who listens to a ton of Infowars,

01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:14.600
I think it was at least more interesting than usual.

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:15.720
Okay.

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:17.000
I don't think it's good.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.400
And I think it's actually really dangerous.

01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:21.320
And I think it's a negative thing.

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:23.080
But in terms of actual content,

01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:26.120
looking at it as somebody who's external

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:29.000
and recognizes nefarious motives on both sides,

01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:33.960
it is interesting to see the clash of agendas.

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:36.200
Oh, well, listen, Mr. Dunn,

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:38.520
we've done D minus radio today,

01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:40.520
which is way above what we're used to.

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:42.360
So I think we're going to call this one an interview.

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:43.960
I think that there's a decent chance

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:46.920
you've humiliated me like crazy in front of my audience.

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:47.420
Yeah.

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:50.280
I don't feel confident at the end of this.

01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:52.440
And I probably extended it too long

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:54.040
because I thought I could win in the end.

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:56.520
And boy, do I hope it drives traffic

01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.560
because then maybe I'll sell some pills.

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:00.040
Yeah.

01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:02.920
So now Mike leaves and Alex,

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:05.560
I guess now is aware of other things

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:07.080
that he should have brought up.

01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:08.440
They talked for an hour.

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.160
And he didn't deny that's his.

01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.720
So he lied in front of everyone.

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:16.840
He's a disgusting little rat.

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:18.040
What?

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:20.040
And I challenged him to come back on the show tomorrow.

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:21.800
Oh, my God.

01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:23.160
Because I meant to get to this

01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:24.920
and I forgot about it while it was on.

01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:25.560
Yeah. Okay.

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:29.080
So Alex now has other posts and stuff.

01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:30.200
I should have brought this up.

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:31.160
You had a fucking hour.

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:33.720
I forgot to get to it.

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:34.760
I forgot to get to it.

01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:38.120
I asked him twice if he's talked to the SPLC.

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:41.080
I had printed out a stack of 30 tweets,

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:42.280
single tweet per page.

01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:45.000
And I just forgot to get to all of them.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.280
I frequently brought up

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:48.360
how he should be killing Bill Gates if he's real.

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:52.040
But I forgot to have my evidence

01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:53.800
that he's a dirty little rat.

01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:57.000
And now I don't know exactly

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.720
what Alex is even bringing up in that context,

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:01.400
nor do I particularly care.

01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:01.720
No.

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:04.600
But I don't necessarily think that Alex is wrong

01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:08.040
that he wasn't a totally good faith actor

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:09.000
in his interview.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:09.320
Totally.

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:11.240
Like, I do think that Mike was being

01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:14.040
a little bit disingenuous now.

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.040
Alex is being full disingenuous.

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:18.920
Well, I mean, you can't trust a zealot.

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:21.080
A zealot has every justification

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:24.920
for lying in service of zealotry.

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:26.040
Yeah, absolutely.

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:28.200
Well, there's one thing you can do with a zealot.

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:30.120
In fact, I challenge Mike Dunn

01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.440
to a bare knuckles boxing match in a ring.

01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:33.240
I'm 47.

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:33.880
He's 27.

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:36.760
I mean, he thinks he's so freaking tough all day long.

01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:37.240
Let's do it.

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:38.520
Give the money to charity.

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:40.760
I am so sick of all these wannabe tough guys

01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:42.120
running their fat mouths all day

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.320
about how badass they are.

01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:49.720
Boy, look, I don't care one way or the other,

01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:53.800
but Alex, that dude will murder you.

01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:58.200
That dude will absolutely fucking murder you.

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:01.960
All it would take is a little bit of ducking and dodging.

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:04.840
Alex would burn out his cardio so fast

01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:06.600
to the point where he couldn't even keep his hands up.

01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.320
It's hard to fight for a long time.

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.720
And by a long time, I mean 30 seconds.

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:13.560
If you're 20 years old and you're boxing

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:16.520
a very much out of shape Alex Jones,

01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:19.000
like 47-year-old dude.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.280
With sleep apnea.

01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:22.040
Yeah, allegedly.

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:22.520
Maybe not.

01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:24.120
Maybe not. Apologies.

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:24.600
Apologies.

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:25.720
But he does have a thick neck.

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:26.120
Yes.

01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:27.080
Like, yeah, okay.

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:30.360
You don't want him to connect on the first shot.

01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:30.680
No.

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:34.920
But if you duck that, if you dodge the first couple swings he takes,

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:35.800
he's done.

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:36.440
Yeah.

01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:39.480
This isn't a four minute 40 situation

01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:41.240
where you can still go 10 rounds.

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:44.360
This is a dude who will absolutely destroy you.

01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:49.480
It would be satisfying to watch in a perverse way.

01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:50.120
Yeah.

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:55.160
So Alex talks to Pete Santilli, who is the guy who got arrested after the

01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:57.960
Malheur standoff.

01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:03.560
Because he's apparently now an expert on FBI infiltration on stuff.

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:06.920
And so Alex needs to sort of feel better about himself

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:09.560
after getting clowned by this Boogaloo dude.

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:12.680
And afterwards, Alex realizes like,

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:15.080
ah, right, fine, I don't want to box you.

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:18.200
You know, I think Owen's been right since the first hour.

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:22.600
Trying to guide me back to not fight with the Boogaloos and not fight with the Proud

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.360
Boys, which I'm not fighting with any of those groups.

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:25.720
I love the Proud Boys.

01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.320
I agree with a lot of stuff the Boogaloos say.

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:32.280
I just see a fertile ground for the feds to set us up.

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:32.920
And you know what?

01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:34.120
Fine, everybody wants a revolution.

01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:35.560
You're trying to set him up.

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.720
It was all a joke about Mike Dunn in the boxing match.

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:40.920
I saw that stuff with, what's his name?

01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:41.720
I've been on the show.

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:44.360
What's it called?

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:44.920
Logan Paul.

01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:47.480
Logan Paul and the other Paul guy.

01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:49.160
Logan Paul and I forget the other guys.

01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:50.600
That's like the biggest news in the country

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:52.040
because they do the boxing matches.

01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:52.600
It was a joke.

01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:54.760
OK, I don't really want to fight you.

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:57.880
You'd you'd definitely be really embarrassing.

01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:58.360
Awful.

01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:00.200
I'd be humiliated in front of my heart.

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:00.840
Yeah, probably.

01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:02.200
I'd have at least a black eye.

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.800
There's no doubt you'd knock out all of the teeth I've been grinding.

01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:07.960
Yeah, yeah, I could use some new teeth.

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:09.880
Uh, hey, look, here's the deal.

01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:11.560
Yeah.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:12.600
Oh, and Owen's right.

01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:14.200
Cooler heads should prevail.

01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:20.760
I do think that I see the Boogaloo's as a way for the FBI and the man to set us up.

01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:25.480
Now, granted, I've been spending weeks on my show using them as a fall guy

01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:28.920
for the storming of the Capitol, which is kind of the same thing.

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:33.640
I literally tried to get one to commit to a target on my air.

01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:37.080
I tried to make him incriminate himself.

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:43.000
I implied heavily and repeatedly that he works for the globalist secretly.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:43.800
Yeah.

01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:44.680
I failed.

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:46.360
And I guess we'll be friends now.

01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:49.400
So embarrassing.

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:57.000
What an, like, just ineffective, bad, like, there's nothing good that can come of this.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.240
I don't even know what Alex expected in terms of, like, a positive outcome from this.

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:07.080
Although I do think it's really, really funny that Alex is doing this like,

01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:10.040
eh, I guess calmer heads got to prevail and we got to be friends with these people

01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:13.000
that I have already said are awful.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.600
And, wow, the intro music that's playing is The Doors.

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:18.760
Don't play with me because you're playing with fire.

01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:20.200
I hate everyone.

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:21.720
I hate everyone.

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:22.600
There's an intern.

01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:24.280
There's an intern who knows what's up.

01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:25.480
Oh, it's got to be.

01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:26.120
For sure.

01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:27.800
Thematically, that is really funny.

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:29.000
Too on the nose.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:29.320
Yeah.

01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:29.880
Yeah.

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:34.200
So, like I said, this is sort of going to be a two-parter into Monday.

01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:34.520
Right.

01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:40.600
And one of the reasons is because I do know that at least someone from The Boogaloo Folk

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:43.400
was on the show on Thursday.

01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:43.800
All right.

01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:48.360
I did not have enough time before we needed to record in order to get that already for

01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:50.840
Friday's episode, but that will be on Monday.

01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:55.640
So, we'll be back on Monday for part two of this.

01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:59.400
I haven't come up with a good pun, like the Caravanity Project.

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:00.440
That's trouble.

01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:03.640
But trust me, by Monday, I will have a great pun.

01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:08.040
Was there a Breakin' Three?

01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:10.120
Let's find out.

01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:11.560
Yeah, that's a good question.

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:12.040
I don't know.

01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:15.320
Breakin' Three.

01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:18.440
Rubber Boogaloo.

01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:20.600
I don't know.

01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:22.760
Breaking Bad season three.

01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:23.080
All right.

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:24.360
Breaking Bad season three.

01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:25.320
I like that one.

01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:25.720
Monday.

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:27.240
Breaking Bad season three.

01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:33.800
We're having a great time.

01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:36.520
Yeah, I'll come up with a better pun.

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:37.020
Nope.

01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:38.300
Blackjack.

01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:40.040
There was no date.

01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:41.080
Ah, shit.

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:43.160
Yeah, you're gonna get this game one of these days.

01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:43.880
Someday.

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:50.040
So, I think that there's some fun to be had by listening to this in terms of seeing somebody

01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:54.680
mirror a lot of Alex's shit back to him in a way that Alex can't really deal with,

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:56.280
can't really respond to.

01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:02.440
It's funny to hear him say, hey, you're probably controlled opposition, which also

01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:07.880
implies that he thought that at the beginning of the interview, which is weird.

01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:11.560
Why even go if you think he's controlled opposition?

01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:12.040
I don't know.

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.480
Or why not make that the thing you bring up first?

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:22.840
I think because if he brought that up first, he wouldn't get the chance to defend Boogalooing.

01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:27.320
It would immediately become like, I'm not controlled opposition, here's all the blah, blah, blah.

01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:28.120
That's probably true.

01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:32.360
And it does give a bit of a coloring to the beginning of the interview.

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:32.760
Totally.

01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:40.040
Where the poise that he's showing or the kind of lack of concern with the way Alex is portraying

01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:44.040
him may come from a place of like, I don't even believe you're real.

01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:48.520
Yeah, I mean, it could also definitely come from a place where, I mean, obviously he had

01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:50.120
quotes from Alex.

01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:52.040
It could come from a place of preparation.

01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:57.000
If you believe that you're going on a show that's controlled opposition, I imagine you'd

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:01.480
be like, okay, then I have to find a way to defeat that.

01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:03.640
Otherwise there's no point in going on the show.

01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:05.720
Or failing defeating that.

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:07.080
Yeah, exploiting it.

01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:12.600
Existing that place in a way that I can achieve my goals while not falling into the traps

01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:13.960
that will be set for me.

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:15.960
Like, hey, do you work for the SPLC?

01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:16.680
Absolutely.

01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:17.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:18.920
And I think that he did that.

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:21.880
And I actually think that that's why this is dangerous.

01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:27.400
Because I think that Mike successfully navigated the terrain of Alex Jones' shitty interview

01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:35.880
style and was given a place where he could appear to be the person who lives Alex Jones'

01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:36.360
ideals.

01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:42.600
And I would not be surprised if that was not an effective recruitment tool to anybody listening

01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:43.400
to Alex's show.

01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:44.280
And that's bad.

01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:49.960
And Alex should recognize, intentional or not, that is the effect that this sort of

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:50.440
thing has.

01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:51.640
Thanks, okay.

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.280
The Boogaloo's should pay Alex for this, quite frankly.

01:47:55.320 --> 01:48:03.400
Well, and then there's just that known psychological exploit in humanity where he sounds so confident.

01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:07.480
He sounds like a true believer.

01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:15.560
And he's laying out stuff in a way where you're like, I guess revolution has to happen somewhere.

01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:17.080
And Alex can't refute that.

01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:17.480
Exactly.

01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:18.760
He can't disagree with it.

01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:20.840
Owen's best thing is like, well, later.

01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:22.280
Later, yeah, great.

01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:23.400
That's a dumb argument.

01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:23.900
Yep.

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:24.860
Yeah.

01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:33.080
And you have it in opposition to or in juxtaposition with this guy who he's saying, I used to look

01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:33.640
up to you.

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:34.680
You were my hero.

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:41.320
The Alex Jones that I grew up listening to, creating that differentiation between the

01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:45.880
Alex Jones I grew up listening to and this person I'm talking to, who is Alex Jones in

01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:47.560
the present, is damning.

01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:48.600
Like, it's...

01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:51.800
No, it's hard to...

01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.000
He got clowned.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:00.840
It's hard not to look at that like 23 and under generation and not see people who were

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:03.160
birthed in the misinformation age.

01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:05.640
You know, like we lived through it.

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:08.520
They were born of it, you know?

01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:10.600
So that ability to have that...

01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:12.280
High speed misinformation.

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:12.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:15.640
His misinformation was still going around in newsletters when we were kids.

01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:21.960
Totally, but like the information era we live in, like they're not going to be cowed by

01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:22.760
old media.

01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:23.720
It's just not going to happen.

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:26.360
And Alex's old media.

01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:27.080
Exactly.

01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:29.880
Anyway, we'll see what happens on the Thursday show.

01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:33.480
Will the bare knuckle boxing match that has been canceled happen?

01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:35.880
Wait for Breaking Bad season three to find out.

01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:37.000
Yes, we'll be back.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.200
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:38.840
We do have a website.

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:39.880
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:40.760
We're also on Twitter.

01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:41.320
We are on Twitter.

01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:42.280
It's at knowledgefight.com.

01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:43.080
Now go to Betjordan.

01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:43.560
Or Facebook.

01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:46.520
We are on Facebook.

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:50.600
And if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:51.400
doing God's work.

01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:51.960
Yeah, we'll be back.

01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:53.000
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:53.480
I'm Leo.

01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:54.520
I'm DZX Clark.

01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:56.520
Daryl Rundis.

01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:59.800
I sometimes forget that I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.320
Andy in Kansas.

01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:01.800
You're on the air.

01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:02.440
Thanks for holding.

01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:05.080
Hello, Alex.

01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:06.040
I'm a first time caller.

01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:06.840
I'm a huge fan.

01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:07.640
I love your work.

01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:16.920
I love you.
