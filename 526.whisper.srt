00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,880
N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,120
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,280
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,280
Knowledge Fight.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,120
Dan and Jordan, Knowledge Fight.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,480
I need money.

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,380
Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas, Andy and...

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,960
Stop it, Andy and, Andy and Kansas.

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,340
It's time to pray.

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,920
Andy and Kansas you're on the air, thanks for holding.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,680
Hello Alex, I'm a 50-cent color, I'm a huge fan.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,560
I love your room.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,000
Knowledgefight.com.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Knowledgefight.com

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I love you

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hey everybody

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan. I'm Jordan

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and talk a little bit about Alex

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Ooooh

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This is what happens when we record in the morning

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Alex Jones talk

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hey Dan!

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Dan, I have a quick question for you. What's up?

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What's your bright spot this morning?

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, this morning my bright spot, Jordan, is

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
we're recording this

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and it's delayed and I appreciate everybody's

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
understanding. The weather in Chicago was

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
such that recording last night would have been

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
a disaster

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
unnecessary

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
risk in terms of

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
transportation

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and my bright spot, I guess, is

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
that because of that

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
little scheduling

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
mix-up, shake-up, I was able to

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
watch a little bit of the Royal Rumble last night

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, okay

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I love a Royal Rumble

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Royal Rumble's the one where thirty people

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
run in every five minutes

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I think it's every two or three minutes

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
but the time is fake

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's all fake

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Who is the person this time who ran in

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and within less than five seconds is gone?

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't know if it was less than five seconds

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
but the sort of joke

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
elimination person was

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The Hurricane

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
is a character who's a superhero

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Wait, a guy named The Hurricane

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
was tossed out quickly?

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Carter

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There's a guy named Hurricane

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and he's a sort of

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
goof character who is a superhero

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and he got

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
eliminated pretty fast

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That'll happen

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I love a Royal Rumble

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I do enjoy the pace of it

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I like the idea of

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
people just keep coming

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Theme songs kick in

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
which is one of my favorite things

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There's exciting returns

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and you know

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
there's a lot of potential for good storytelling

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
in that structure

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and yeah

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I enjoyed it

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
A lot of people are probably asking if I have

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
thoughts about it

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I don't have thoughts about it

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It just was

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hurricane was my favorite character

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
For sure

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It was fun though

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It was nice. How about you?

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
My Bright Spot Dan is a movie

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
called PG colon

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Psycho Gorman

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and it is

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You guys listening cannot tell

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
that Jordan just leaned in very hard

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Serious

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's one of those movies

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that was made by just

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
somebody for

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
50 bucks or whatever

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It is a live action cartoon

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
that is very occasionally

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
incredibly funny

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
in a dry deadpan

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
way and also incredibly terrible

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
but it's one of those movies that I'm not

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
going to recommend anybody watch

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
but I'm so happy it exists

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What year are we talking about?

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Immediately

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This is recent?

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's just wild and out there

109
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's one of those things where you're just

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
happy that something like that is real

111
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If it didn't exist

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I've thought about willing something like

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
that into existence before

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Do you think that this has a possibility

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
of becoming a cult classic?

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I do not

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Aggressive head shaking

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's not good and people aren't going to watch it

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
or enjoy it but it's there

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Wow high praise

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's important to be there

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's important for it to exist

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't know how to describe something more

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
aptly than that

125
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I feel like I understand exactly what you're talking about

126
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and I have no idea what this thing is

127
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah exactly

128
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We're going to be talking about the time span

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
between January 28th and

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
31st 2021 Blackjack

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah dammit I was actually

132
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
my plan on the way here

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
when he starts I'm going to go

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Blehhhh

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And then when you're done I'll go

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Backfired

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Failed miserably

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We're not actually going to be talking about

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
the 29th on Friday because that was a

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
travel day for Alex coming back from Utah

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
vacation

142
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm not going to be talking about the 30th

143
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
because that was Saturday

144
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
although I do have a little bit of something to say

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Alex did a special

146
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
report with

147
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Stuart Rhodes of the Oathkeepers

148
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
in studio

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
where they did running commentary

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
over a documentary

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
about the lockdown

152
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
or something

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I was watching it and I was thinking

154
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
maybe we'll cover this but it's

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
just the two of them having kind of a casual

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
conversation about secession

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and it's not really

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Beyond

159
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
just saying that they did that and that

160
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Stuart Rhodes is standing by

161
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
the Oathkeepers who got arrested

162
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Of course

163
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's all they really need to know

164
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I imagine he wakes up every morning and he's like

165
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hey they didn't get me yet

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's it. That's his life now

167
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh the other thing that was worth

168
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
pointing out is that Stuart Rhodes

169
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
was saying that what you should do

170
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
is throw a big rave

171
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and then when the police come to shut it down

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
shoot at them

173
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Basically it was his

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They're encroaching

175
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
on your right to live freely

176
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and then you know

177
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
start it off

178
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So here's what we do

179
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We set a trap for the law

180
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's basically his version of

181
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
civil disobedience

182
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Do something that will

183
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
attract the police and when they try to arrest you

184
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
start fighting

185
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay so here's what we do

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We hold a big rave but before that

187
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
we dig some trenches right

188
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
outside the rave and then put some

189
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
wooden spikes in there

190
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and then cover it with leaves and when the cops come

191
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
they'll all fall and impale themselves

192
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's a pretty good plan Now Stuart I like your plan

193
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Have you considered quicksand?

194
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Instead of

195
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
spikes I find that quicksand works better

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
destroys the evidence

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Derek actually came up with

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
moat and but

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
it's just too much I love moats

200
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Now have you considered this

201
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I know a guy

202
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
who likes to hoist safes

203
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Get a pulley system going

204
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Have a safe hanging way up in the air

205
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm liking it I'm liking it Sometimes people use

206
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
pianos Sometimes people use pianos

207
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I love pianos That is a possibility as well

208
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
When the cops come

209
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
drop the piano or safe

210
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Also we need to have

211
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
two people walking by holding a very

212
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
pain of glass

213
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I do like the idea

214
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
that it just turns into

215
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Looney Tunes There's a watermelon

216
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
cart The whole thing

217
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Someone walks through with a bunch of pies

218
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah

219
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's not a good

220
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
special report by any means

221
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's not interesting and it's very

222
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
long and we'll not be covering

223
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000

277
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Happy birthday put a downer

278
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,100
Here's an out-of-context drop from today's show

279
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,020
Burn in hell Frederick Nietzsche and Joe Biden and the rest of you Satanist Wow

280
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,560
Quite a quite a Nietzsche and Biden mm-hmm quite a group. That's a that's a list of

281
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
the two luminaries of

282
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,120
Philosophical thought I think when I think of Nietzsche I think of Biden when I think of Biden

283
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,880
I think of Nietzsche of course. Yeah, what is Biden, but the ubermensch indeed yeah, so here we start on the 28th

284
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,960
Alex has

285
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,000
Kind of figured out that at this point that oh boy some oath keepers got arrested

286
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,040
Yeah, because they stormed the Capitol yeah, I gotta figure out how this boys not

287
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,000
boogaloo

288
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,280
Straight up both keepers and and with a lot of these other groups

289
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,900
He's sort of been able to figure out how to thread the needle with Q anon. It's like okay

290
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:26,300
Yeah, it was all a setup mm-hmm with the the proud boys ah Enrique Tarrio

291
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:33,340
He is a fed totally totally absolutely easy stuff. Yeah with Antifa obviously. I hate them already

292
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,820
Yeah

293
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,820
Both keepers are a little bit more difficult because Alex is

294
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,280
Long time friends with Stuart Rhodes, but he's been a huge promoter of them

295
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,640
And so he kind of has got to be like hey somebody infiltrated

296
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,800
them

297
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,000
The old keepers have had three of their group

298
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,200
indicted

299
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:00,200
For going in to the Capitol and of course they have informants of people claiming that they were training

300
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,920
Months before there's some type of capital incursion who knows if any of that's true

301
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:13,680
But the point is is that they are sending infiltrators into every major organization. Yeah, who knows could be anybody yeah

302
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,400
Yeah, right. We're always we're always infiltrating wrong somebody strong take now now

303
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:26,560
So I was I was kind of confused when I launched into this episode because the day before this Alex had interviewed the

304
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,360
Boogaloo boy Mike Dunn mm-hmm

305
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,040
As I was listening back as I doing the episode. I realized that we missed a real

306
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,500
Great opportunity for a Mike Dunn Mike down

307
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Oh

308
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,740
Did we miss a great opportunity or did we just miss a an okay opportunity yeah

309
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,660
I might have just been okay, but it was there on the table and we missed it

310
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,940
Alex had been humiliated and brow beaten by this guy. I was like okay

311
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:03,420
I know that he's gonna interview another Boogaloo dude on this 28th January 28th episode

312
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,780
It's like okay

313
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:10,200
Let's get to it, and he does not get to it instead this kind of seems to be where his head's at

314
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,020
And for me, let me just lay out what I think's biggest and first and foremost

315
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,100
Trump if he gets off the defense could be the president of the world as Chris ready

316
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,540
Said in a very important interview. That's gone viral last night. We should grab that

317
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:30,180
Chris ruddy interview it's on Newsmax. It's got about a million views as of this morning when I watch it 5 a.m.

318
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,260
And he says Trump can now be president of the world. That's actually a true statement

319
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,220
What the fuck are you talking all right, okay?

320
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,580
So if I understand correctly Trump can become president of the world

321
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,140
power and

322
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,260
Popularity yeah, so Xi Jinping is just gonna be like hey, man

323
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,820
I got you're just got to be the president of the world you got it. Yeah, yeah, absolutely

324
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,800
Absolutely, they're all gonna jump on board listen. I get it listen. I'm

325
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,360
Aggressively against your policies, and I think you're a toxic influence, but

326
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,340
Is he the president of Burma now is that how this goes Myanmar I know

327
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,140
Whenever it's taken over by a Junta

328
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:26,020
You make an interesting point yeah um I would say that first of all president of the world doesn't exist fair president of the

329
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,860
World being a position implies world government

330
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,580
I would say that would be him being a globalist if if anyone could be a globalist it would be president of the world

331
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,540
I don't want like Obama to be the president of the world

332
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,840
I don't want Hillary to be the president absolutely not

333
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,920
But I do remember a lot of time spent on

334
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:51,720
Infowars where Alex was talking about how Hillary was gonna be the president sure and then bill was going to become the secretary general

335
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Of the UN yeah, and then they would be together the president of the world you got this was evil

336
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:04,320
Yeah, now Alex is I guess excited about Trump being the president of the world which sure again doesn't exist no

337
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:11,240
Whoa oh boy very dumb, which is is he going to get the whole world on board?

338
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,280
Or like what is he gonna do with the holdouts? I guess conquer them. Yeah, he would have to

339
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,120
I mean, it's yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff that goes unspoken

340
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,360
There's one thing I know about Eritrea. They're not backing down

341
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Switzerland gonna try to stay neutral

342
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,200
so

343
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:39,920
High minded concerns Trump in the possibility of being the president of the world sure certainly very serious mm-hmm

344
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Also, Alex is a little bit petty

345
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:49,280
Mmm. I'm told by sources close to Biden that he has to read a teleprompter speech up to five times before he can give one

346
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,520
That's half-decent like he gave that very short

347
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,080
Shortest really ever inaugural speech I've heard of I mean Trump's over an hour long Biden's was less than ten minutes

348
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,080
Yeah, and that's because he had to rehearse that at least five times when he's not rehearsed folks

349
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:08,040
He doesn't know what planet he is on is it possible that Trump's was too long. Why is

350
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:15,400
His preparation the worst thing a human can do in our world yeah that that is so bizarre like yeah

351
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Oh, he took it seriously

352
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,720
You know what I'm gonna. Go. I'm gonna go crazy on Alex. Let me tell you this

353
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,920
I've got maybe 45 minutes of material

354
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:31,280
It took me 10 years to write that and I practiced it way more than five times. Yeah, one of the things about performance

355
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,760
Is oftentimes you prepare to?

356
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,880
to

357
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,480
Appear unprepared yes or to prepare like you you want to feel natural. Yeah, I don't understand

358
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:51,080
You have to say something a million times to make it sound like you're saying it the first time there's a very big difference between

359
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
somebody who is

360
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,920
Desperately unprepared and off the cuff and somebody who is able to

361
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,680
Do things off the cuff yeah, I I don't I don't like

362
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:11,400
This particular instance too is very bizarre to me because it's the inauguration speech. Yeah, that's

363
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,920
Probably one of the most important

364
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
biggest sort of

365
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,680
highest respect

366
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,540
Speeches it's kind of a big deal that you're going to give especially in the early times of your presidency

367
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,420
You're gonna set the course maybe give a thesis for like what you want

368
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
To achieve in your time in office

369
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:37,520
I set the tone. I don't want somebody just being like ah fuck it. I'm gonna

370
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,680
I

371
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,480
Think that what Alex is saying is a bad thing about Biden is a actually a really good

372
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:50,320
I would argue that someone who gives a 10-minute speech over someone who gives an hour speech is always better and

373
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,720
Maybe the preparation allowed him to parse it down to 10 minutes. Maybe trim the fat

374
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,120
Editing is about getting rid of stuff. Yeah

375
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,680
so

376
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:08,600
Now that Alex knows that the Oath Keepers were there and arrested and that's gonna be infiltrators

377
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,520
maybe

378
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:17,040
I'll see how Stewart Alex has got a kind of adjust the narrative a little bit and what I think is really funny about this

379
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,120
Is that Alex has to keep changing the narrative?

380
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,400
Whenever new groups of right-wing people are proven to have been there and arrested. There's an issue there

381
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:34,040
So here's the newest version if we just don't let them use this capital event that they clearly infiltrated Patriot groups

382
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,040
They used Antifa to lead the chance

383
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,640
They got two or three people from each large Patriot group Boogaloo's

384
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,800
Quasi-patriot Oh and Troy are people there but I think overall it's being controlled

385
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,840
The the the Oath Keepers who've been a great organization. They really do remember

386
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:58,000
Still being set up. I've done a great job right here led by Stuart Rhodes. And then of course, you've got the proud boys that

387
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,120
Good people overall, but it's perfect to be set up at infiltrated and I've reviewed all the footage

388
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,240
There were Boogaloo's there were proud boys and there were

389
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,840
Three Oath Keepers out of the organization tens of thousands

390
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,520
It's true though that that that did lead the break into the capital and I've spent hours again last night this morning

391
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,360
And now that it's all codified now that it's all come out

392
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,560
I actually got tears in my eyes this morning having to watch a Wall Street Journal report

393
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,040
That shows the three proud boys being instrumental breaking into the capital

394
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,920
And they can say oh we showed them and all this stuff

395
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,580
They're not all fed. Some of them are just useful idiots. They got caught up in the mob psychology

396
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,860
But we're not gonna be like the media and lie

397
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,560
You know about things and just you know, say it was all provocateur. It was all staged

398
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:48,320
If some of it was people being foolish, so what he's trying to imply and he does on this episode

399
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,800
Is that like the people who are leading the charge?

400
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,920
There's a couple people from each group that they had got set up right to

401
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:03,000
Make everyone in those groups look guilty, correct? This is complicated. So

402
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:11,120
Every single right-wing group was infiltrated. Uh-huh, and then led to the capital to

403
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,840
Overthrow the government right now. Let me ask you this question Dan

404
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,740
Yeah, why was it so easy to lead them to the capital? Hmm? Is it maybe because they wanted to do it?

405
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:26,560
I mean, obviously, yes, it's not entrapment even if Alex is

406
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:33,040
A complete nonsensical conspiracy is true. Yeah, but also none of that is true. It just

407
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,120
Did it know you you guys tried and you failed that's it

408
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,280
You tried to overthrow a country, but you're not a unita. So you failed

409
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:50,140
The end yeah, and also I don't feel like Joe Biggs would like this kind of tone from Alex

410
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:56,540
Mm-hmm, because it implies that at best he's a useful idiot. Yeah. Yeah, he's calling everybody

411
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:02,940
What it this is almost like the revenge of stevie peas like now you're all useful idiots

412
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,300
I'm still the smart one. Damn it. I'm still standing. Yeah

413
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,140
Joe Biggs has got a like I

414
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:17,040
I got to imagine he's gonna have some complicated therapy in prison about his relationship with Alex

415
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,400
Mm-hmm, because he gets fired from it for wars because of Pizzagate star or he leaves

416
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,040
He tries to start his own news operation Alex kind of is associated with but it's like I don't know keep it an arm's distance

417
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,800
Yeah, the proud boys show up. He decides I'm jumping in both feet

418
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,960
Why not he rises through the ranks of the proud boys becomes like

419
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:45,820
Really high up in the proud boys makes a name for himself in the in the aggressive dangerous right-wing community

420
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:52,640
And then storms the capital and goes to prison. Wow. It's so crazy that when it becomes convenient, they just cut loose

421
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,620
Yeah, isn't it? So weird. They don't have that loyalty or anything like that

422
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:04,940
Who would have guessed man who could have seen that coming? We've seen it happen with all of these groups as Alex

423
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:14,460
So someone who is loyal to a fault someone who is just just

424
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,940
You know true true as the day is long. I don't know why not Roger Stone is back. Okay, and

425
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,860
He kind of wants to imply that everybody who's into history is a secret leftist

426
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:35,540
Okay, they want to erase this record in one word impeachment Nixon impeachment Trump

427
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:43,380
Impeachment it's not right and it's not fair and we know that history is written by the left the historians are

428
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:48,900
leftists some of some authors like Rick Perlstein pose as

429
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,900
Historians they're not historians. They're

430
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:59,900
Propagandists, we can't let this happen. You see I think this last final battle for the president is crucial for his legacy

431
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,620
There is this battle of a historical

432
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,820
Pushing yeah that you see that is that is a really it's an interesting thing

433
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,720
That seems to be at least subtly behind a lot of these these right-wing figures

434
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,340
That I find this very interesting the way like sort of Alex believes in lore

435
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:25,940
As being real. Yeah, and just completely false versions of history

436
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:33,180
Roger is attacking historians as the left. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the problem is history

437
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,660
Is left-leaning?

438
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:42,660
The more you read about history the more you're like, oh those fascists are bad and the more you see the fascists

439
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:47,060
You're like, oh in the modern times the people who are doing the fascism are

440
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:53,740
Roger Stone and his ilk so it kind of does seem like it's in their interest to portray all of history as

441
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:58,340
evil, yeah, I mean history is unkind to those who want to cling to

442
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:06,140
Biases and bigotries of the past totally and I mean pretty clear anyway

443
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:14,060
Alex is wants to talk to Roger about the impeachment trial. Yeah, the impeachment trial is foremost in his mind and

444
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,380
He really wants this fucking thing to be a circus. Mm-hmm

445
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:23,740
He really wants Trump to go I don't want it to be you're out of order. I want it to be a circus, too

446
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:30,540
I don't I I wonder what would be the most sort of politically useful thing

447
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,940
For the sort of policies that we would like sure sure

448
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:40,860
Would it be more effective for it just to be sort of quiet and go through like the process or would it be effective?

449
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:46,960
I think if it's a circus, it's probably more effective in splintering the the GOP. Yeah

450
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,400
Yeah, I think that it would lead to

451
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,820
such a

452
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:57,080
Embarrassing showcase that you know people in the Senate would have much more

453
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,540
baggage

454
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,960
For not voting to convict. Oh, yeah, absolutely

455
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,340
And I think that maybe that would be politically useful, but I'm not positive

456
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:12,500
It would also be a pretty embarrassing thing just to watch. I mean for the concept of justice

457
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:17,900
which if you don't have a kind of shared element of

458
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,020
Justice a society can't function. Mm-hmm

459
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:27,100
So the idea of holding like a two-day little like hey Trump, you're evil

460
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:34,100
5545 you're acquitted is so offensive to the concept of justice that it's like why?

461
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,220
Why believe that any punishment will ever come to these evil fries?

462
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,900
I'm I'm I'm not even trying to predict or talk about like conviction or acquittal

463
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:50,420
I'm talking about the strategy of Trump. No totally there. That's what I'm saying about a two-day trial or something like that

464
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,880
that's so offensive to me of like we have

465
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,980
Evidence that is

466
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:04,460
Controvertible, I guess I guess what you're saying makes sense like a two-day trial with an acquittal or whatever is kind of

467
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,700
Yeah, it's whereas a week two-week trial where Trump is going crazy

468
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:17,140
Yeah screaming nonsense conspiracy theories and then an acquittal could be toxic to the people who voted for acquittal

469
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:24,740
Here's the biggest reason. Here's the biggest reason. I don't know how long Trump can be quiet for his lawyers true

470
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:31,420
So the shorter lawyers wow, he's got two and Barnes is coming baby. I think they all quit

471
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:38,580
Well, I think the five quit and now he got to like yesterday or something like that, but probably great lawyer. Yeah

472
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,860
Yeah, oh, yeah

473
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:45,500
God was who but like the longer it goes on the more likely Trump is to be like

474
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:53,020
I've got something to say and once we get there then the fireworks start happening left and right it is gonna be Barnes, isn't it?

475
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:59,700
It's totally gonna be Barnes. I feel it in my bones. Yeah, I can't wait to say good job Barnes or good work

476
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:14,420
It's gonna be so good and I think Trump needs to go in there swinging and saying I'm the guy that's pro law and order

477
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,220
I'm the guy that was you know, trying to expose this election fraud

478
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:22,200
I'm the he can use that as a place to put on the evidence of election fraud as well

479
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,780
They're not gonna be able to tell him to shut up. This would be spectacular

480
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,400
This would be the ultimate reality TV show and according to many scholars

481
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,060
He could get up to two months of the time to put on his evidence properly hell

482
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:39,620
Yeah, doesn't agree up front to just let a few lawyers represent him if he does that they're gonna hang him out to dry

483
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,460
What do you think? I think that they can tell him to shut up. Yes, they can

484
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,900
Like if someone is being completely uncooperative

485
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:52,940
I'm just being like out of order. You could try him in absentia. No, haven't you seen a

486
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,780
Like haven't you ever been to a court, you know

487
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,340
One of those quick traffic courts where they go all day

488
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,400
You're allowed to just scream for as long as you want up to two months and they can't do anything to this thing

489
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,640
It's contempt of course. Nope, not at all

490
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:14,680
Especially not in the Senate. It's a crucial loophole that we refuse to close never but if you just misbehave in court

491
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,320
Yep, you get off you wait him out. Yeah

492
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,080
Yeah, some people say tubal cane. Some people just wait him out. Yeah, some people go

493
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,120
Yeah, I

494
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Don't think this is a good idea

495
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:37,160
I do. I think this is dumb in terms of the goals that Alex has I think it's in the real world

496
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:43,100
It would probably be unproductive and I think that there's another idea that's going around that also would be

497
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:49,580
Unproductive to the goals that Alex has although because I'm against those goals. I think that maybe they should do it

498
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,220
Yeah, I'm not entirely sure. I'm egging you on I have bad. I haven't fully

499
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,860
thought about or considered the

500
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:03,540
Logistics or the possibilities of this idea of the Patriot Party right a Trump party splitting

501
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,580
But just from sort of a basic view. I think what you would end up doing is completely

502
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:18,700
Fracturing the right-wing vote. Yeah, the conservative vote would not be unified and Democrats would probably run

503
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,740
Roughshod have a great almost every election. They might even get DC into statehood

504
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:30,100
It seems like that would be a really bad decision in terms of the right

505
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:39,600
Electorally if they had a two-month trial for Trump to present his evidence, uh-huh. They would have to talk real slow. I

506
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Think Rudy could handle it

507
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,820
But the

508
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:52,660
Roger is against this idea of the the Patriot Party, which I think is probably good political instincts on his part

509
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:59,100
I think I think that there's a lot of dangers in terms of like were that party to get rolling and have

510
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
any kind of

511
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,780
Actual foothold in power. Yeah, I think you could end up with a pretty

512
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:13,020
Terrifying Overton window kind of situation, but in terms of fracturing electoral power on the right

513
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:18,680
I think that there's I think it would be dangerous for them. Yeah, and and Roger realizes that

514
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,100
Soros and the globalists don't fund third parties because they don't work

515
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,420
They might be a one-issue, you know deal to stop fracking or this or that

516
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:32,020
So they'll fund it just to give it legitimacy to shut off our energy supplies like the Green Party

517
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,700
But when you pull back from this, it's taking over parties you want to do

518
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,220
It's Soros and the globalists have taken over the Democrats that the communist Chinese are taking them over

519
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,820
They're putting in their DA's they're putting in their attorney generals. It's a nightmare

520
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,380
We need as American people to control at least one party. We almost got there with Trump. I agree

521
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,940
That's why they fear him so much. He wanted a landslide. They're absolutely right. We do not need this third party

522
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:59,360
That is a nuclear option down the road, you know just for him to run for president or something if he had to

523
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:05,260
But he's not gonna be barred from that. He's gonna defeat this trial in the Senate and I really think that

524
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,660
He should run for governor or senator or maybe he should run against Rubio

525
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:14,740
I mean, I really think we need to get President Trump back in back in DC

526
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,660
That is what we need to be the real leader

527
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:23,100
I don't fucking understand why you think he has any interest in running against Marco Rubio

528
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:29,420
I mean maybe for the the campaign he'd have fun with that. Sure. She doesn't want to be in the fucking Senate. Good. God. No

529
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,940
Imagine imagine. Oh god, that'd be terrible. Yeah, what a nightmare that be

530
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:42,160
He doesn't want to do like that would be so much work. Mm-hmm. It's not all about Trump. No, no

531
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:48,900
You have to cooperate. There's a there's a minority whip who tells you what to do

532
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:54,140
Yeah, you're on the phone all the time trying to get donations and shit. Imagine that. Yeah. Oh

533
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,380
Can you imagine what kind of bills he would write?

534
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,860
Cran yeah

535
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,980
brutal absolutely brutal

536
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,540
bill to

537
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:12,980
Provide senators in Florida with free fast food. No, and it's so right. It's so right to be like no

538
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,580
No, we need to maintain the two-party system because as long as both parties are awful

539
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,500
they can keep passing the ball back and forth, you know, so that means that they can still be owned by

540
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:29,140
Billionaires if any party governed effectively the other party would be destroyed, you know

541
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,580
Like the Democrats already are like, whoa

542
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:36,140
Well, I know we promised 2000 but let's do 1400 and you're like guys

543
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:44,140
Really? Are we doing this? Mm-hmm. Okay, we'll see the Republicans in two years. Thanks, buddy. Good work. Good work you morons

544
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,700
Yeah

545
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:52,140
Stupid it's a bummer. Yep, but Trump will not be a senator. Absolutely not. Why would he run against DeSantis?

546
00:33:54,100 --> 00:34:01,140
If he runs for governor, there's no way the state remains in the Union the end if Trump is the governor of Florida

547
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:07,340
He is the president of the United Florida moving Mar-a-Lago to Texas. Yeah, exactly there. We will take our stand

548
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:13,120
I'm moving to the Alamo, Texas. Yeah, that's not the Alamo shit too close to the border

549
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,120
so Roger is

550
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,300
Weird because he doesn't want a third party like this Patriot Party is a bad idea

551
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:27,880
But at the same time don't give any fucking money to the RNC. No, fuck them evil. Trump should be president of the world

552
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:36,100
Look, I would not donate a penny to the Republican National Committee and I would urge those out there in the info Wars audience to

553
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:43,400
Follow in suit there. There is no chance that money is being spent effectively. Mm-hmm. Okay

554
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,960
amazing points, but please go back to

555
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,680
What ruddy said about Trump could be really the president of the world?

556
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:57,360
For nationalism for patriotism for populism for better trade deals. How would you be the president of the world for nationalism?

557
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,200
Very weird very very weird

558
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:07,640
As president of the world, no one can move. I think it's probably a politically

559
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,080
I don't know

560
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,240
counterproductive

561
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,360
To say hey, we shouldn't have a third party. We got to take over the Republican Party

562
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:22,160
But also don't give the Republican Party any money. No. No, let's make sure we don't support them

563
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,880
But also we had to take them over. Yeah, we all got to give money to the right scam. Not the wrong way man

564
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
Exactly. Yeah, so

565
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:36,400
Alex it gets mad here. He's Roger takes off because he's he's just at his piece and

566
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:45,040
Alex gets mad about Nancy Pelosi because she is not thrilled with there being members of the house who's murderers

567
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,240
Seem to have hostile intentions

568
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,240
It's murdering attentions

569
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,640
Marjorie Greene

570
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:59,920
Certainly has said some things that would make me feel unsafe in a work environment. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

571
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,400
She's not Nancy Pelosi is not happy about that and good for her because I don't think she should have to put up with that

572
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,120
Right, right. Then you have the the Lauren Boebert's of the world also not making you feel super safe

573
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:18,720
And so she in an interview said that the enemy is inside. Yeah

574
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,360
You know Alex is not thrilled about that wrong not thrilled wrong Alex is pretty mad about that

575
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:32,000
That's a pretty astounding clip of Pelosi saying that the they need more security because of Republican Congress people

576
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,600
Hey lady

577
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,320
It was your supporter went and shot Scalise and tried to kill 18 others you lying sack of garbage

578
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,720
Burning hell Pelosi and by that I mean we're not judgment on you. I think God's sending you to hell

579
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,800
That's what I mean by that

580
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,080
okay, the thing that I think is interesting about that clip is it's one of a number of times Alex has to

581
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
over-clarify stuff

582
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,360
All right, so

583
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,840
Everybody is getting caught for doing the thing. I told them to do I better be real safe

584
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:07,400
I better better be real safe Nancy Pelosi. You're gonna burn it out and by that I mean

585
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:14,440
I believe that God has it out for you and once you die your soul is gonna have trouble and in this circumstance

586
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,560
I'm gonna point you to Romans 12 16 because nobody gets mad at the Bible

587
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,680
Yeah, so Owen Schroyer has been sitting alongside

588
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,720
He's theoretically hosting the show and Alex is co-hosting

589
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:33,240
But Alex is just doing the everything sure sure and Owen has some ideas that he wants to introduce to the proceedings about how unpopular

590
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,460
Joe Biden is mm-hmm. He has some primary evidence that I think is stupid

591
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,560
But you know getting back to the Biden issue here Alex. I was looking at this today

592
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,840
And I just have one little printout here. It doesn't really work for the printout, but I was looking at

593
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:53,340
Google search trends and if the crew wants to do this they can do this I was looking at Google search trends

594
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,320
Biden as a Google search trend was almost

595
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:02,780
Non-existent in the year 2020 almost non-existent Trump on the Google search trend is like number one

596
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:07,240
Oh, but Biden had the most votes ever and then the other thing I noticed Alex

597
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:16,560
two of the top three word associations with Biden on a search trend is this what we're doing pedophilia and

598
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,440
dementia

599
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,840
So the world under why to this guy is and and guys by the way lay that paper back down

600
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,520
I know they consume in more lay it back down where you had it

601
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,440
They should just do this because it doesn't really look good on the printout the

602
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,140
The things I don't care that you but I mean still zoom in on it

603
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,100
No, they can do it. They can zoom in that camera's got like five times more zoom

604
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,240
Just zoom in on that guys because this is huge. Yeah, absolutely. Oh, this is huge huge

605
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,040
Yeah, Google Trends Trump put out an online poll where he

606
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,240
98% of people said they want him to be president. I don't understand how Biden won. Yeah, it's impossible. It's impossible

607
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,520
98% of Americans want Trump to be president. That's the only polls that I listen to this

608
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:05,000
Yeah, this is this is an instance of taking something that on its on the surface

609
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,520
Appears to be making an argument that Trump is far more popular than Biden

610
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,560
Yeah, but also has no relevance not to the larger issue that they're talking about. Nope. This is very dumb

611
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,640
Yeah, so we got some guests coming up after Roger. Yeah, we got a couple of big big hitters

612
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:27,840
But I want to let listeners also know Stuart Rhodes founder row keepers will be joining us the last 30 minutes the next hour

613
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,280
We have another one of the boogaloo leaders

614
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,120
Joining us to talk about what really happened at the Capitol

615
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,280
You know, I have to say that the boogaloo guy we had on your state

616
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,160
It's some cheap shot saying, you know that I might be in the CIA or a fed, but I get from his perspective

617
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:49,480
I'm saying that to him, but only because you can't swing a stick in any of these groups and not hit a Fed

618
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,260
I mean look at the Enrique Tarrio thing coming out. He's been a federal informant for many many years

619
00:39:54,260 --> 00:40:00,400
Is he a bad guy? No, no, I can what but and that just goes with the territory ladies and gentlemen

620
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,420
What it's the same thing with the boogaloo is the same thing with any of this Wow, that's weird

621
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,580
he is if he is a fat informant a

622
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,720
Literal demon servant. Uh-huh. I like that guy. Hey, he's a good guy

623
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:19,260
Look, I don't I don't know what Tarrio was up to like. I don't know now me

624
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:24,380
I haven't I still haven't seen concrete evidence that he was informing on the Proud Boys still don't care either

625
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:30,340
I'm Alex's perspective. He has to think that he was and that's the way that Alex is presenting this

626
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,460
Yeah, it makes no sense to be like, yeah, this guy was a snitch

627
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:39,220
He was infiltrating groups in order to make them look bad. Maybe even was instrumental in planning false flags

628
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,380
Demon servant good, dude

629
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,580
That makes no sense no also is

630
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:50,720
Jarring to hear Alex be like look I talked to this boogaloo guy

631
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,380
He said I was a fucking inside dude, like I was false controlled opposition. You know what? Hey, I understand

632
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:01,780
I'm saying the same thing about him and hey, maybe he's cool. Yeah, you guys are doing great work together

633
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,660
You guys are doing great work together. What man? That's some that's some

634
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,940
Softened really fast. Yeah on this whole thing

635
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:16,860
Yeah, the boogaloo boys were supposed to be his ticket out of this and now he's like like these guys. Oh

636
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,020
We're all yeah

637
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:25,000
we're all in trouble and I think one of the issues is sort of distorted views of what unity is possible or is

638
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:31,220
Pursuable right and Owen Schroyer seems to be really on the unity kick right now

639
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,460
That seems to be his big project

640
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:40,100
Mm-hmm. He's talking about like reaching out to Black Lives Matter and and like and folks on the left so certain

641
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:45,060
I saw I heard him screaming fuck BLM. Oh, yeah, and antifa

642
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:50,500
I'm just positive that there was a flag involved. They burned it. I think they burned a flag

643
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:56,380
Oh, yeah, and now they're gonna you want to reach out? Okay good and Alex is kind of like yeah

644
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:01,580
Shit, I'm supposed to be above partisan politics

645
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:08,140
That was to be my whole thing. What happened? I mean, I want unity. I don't want to fight with the average Democrat

646
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:12,020
We need a populist movement that is for common sense in this country all team

647
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:17,440
We're bringing that up because we get so part of described them especially under the last few years with Trump that that's something that actually

648
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:21,660
Energize the worst elements of the Soros left to kind of take over the populist

649
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,420
Liberals and who are who are on average not bad people and I think could be reached out to what do you think?

650
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:31,680
I think that the reality of what Alex is talking about is I miss when

651
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,500
Some people on the left were tricked by my opposition to the Iraq war

652
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:41,440
I miss back when I could yell about George Bush and I could be deemed not an

653
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:48,900
Incredibly insane extreme right-wing zealot. Yeah, there was a time there where I wasn't in the pocket of somebody whose mood

654
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,300
I was looking I miss having the facade of

655
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,760
Rationality because I was to the right of George W Bush. Yep

656
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,540
Yeah, this is this is silly yeah, I will I will accept it a

657
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:09,460
unity from these people when I they apologize publicly and make amends for it and

658
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:16,940
Correct their mistakes. Yeah, then we can be unified again until then go fuck yourselves. So speaking of unity

659
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,100
Owen

660
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,820
Believes that he sees opportunity in the GameStop and Robin Hood

661
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:31,500
situation in order to bring people into the fold this disillusionment right with the perceived fairness of

662
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:38,060
the stock market is something that he believes that they can use to bring people into the ranks of the

663
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:43,660
Info wars universe and and I believe that that is false unity

664
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,280
I believe that's you know

665
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:51,140
The the kind of thing that you see constantly with anything that galvanizes people particularly online

666
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,940
You'll see an attempt at infiltration of it by the right-wing

667
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,260
Demagogue totally and I can see a bit of Owen

668
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,740
Seeing an opportunity there. Although I don't think

669
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:11,140
That it's gonna be effective and I also don't think it's gonna be something that's gonna be even discussed on info whores

670
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:15,140
In within a week. Yeah, I would agree with so I don't care to talk about it too much

671
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:19,380
because it's not really a big issue and it also is something that I

672
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:27,580
Just see it as being like this might be a wedge. This might be something we can use and oh and just doesn't have the chops

673
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:33,980
So we get to the the next book boogaloo boy. Mm-hmm who comes in he's guy named Magnus Panvidya

674
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,100
He's a guy fine. Yeah

675
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:44,760
he is the boogaloo boy who was recently interviewed on the Jimmy Dore show and it seems to be somebody who's making the

676
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:51,860
Rounds a bit in terms of like being someone who people will interview sure and I can understand

677
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,860
Why because he doesn't sound crazy

678
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,980
which is

679
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,980
I mean a plus

680
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,740
For a public face

681
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:05,060
If I was going to be the public face of a group whose main goal was a second Civil War

682
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:10,300
Mm-hmm. It would be wise to be like, hey, come on. I'm a good dude. I'm smart. I'm

683
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:16,380
Conversational you guys can I like all sorts of people. Yeah, I seem rational as shit. Yeah, and

684
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,480
He has a different approach

685
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:26,140
Sort of a good cop bad cop kind of thing with Mike Dunn where Mike Dunn when he was on the day before

686
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,020
Was kind of being a brusque Alex. You're kind of a shitbag. Yeah

687
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:34,300
Next hey, Alex, we're the ones who are doing the shit that you pretend you do

688
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:40,660
Yeah, now that Alex has taken that lashing and also now has softened so much

689
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:46,700
Yeah, now comes the balm the sound sure to make those those wounds feel better

690
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:53,800
Magnus give us your view on what the boogaloo's really are and what you guys just did and what just unfolded

691
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,940
activate the boogaloo's

692
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,460
Uh-huh. Yeah, we're just kind of a libertarian

693
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,700
Anarchist coalition kind of a militia more of a movement

694
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,060
We started off in the lockdowns

695
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:13,580
Then we expanded throughout the whole George George Floyd and all the BLM events and look

696
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:16,460
You just continue to be operating on the ground is kind of a more

697
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:21,100
Unifying not right or left armed movement. Fuck you

698
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:28,180
Well, I kind of like that actually I want to get the left involved in liberals deprogramming and into owning guns of self-defense

699
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,280
This isn't the way

700
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,280
no, no, no, I

701
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:38,160
Think that you already see a contradiction between and what Mike Dunn was saying and what Magnus is saying

702
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,440
He's saying we got started in the lockdown. Yeah, this is this grew out of

703
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,360
Absolutely with jokes about a second Civil War

704
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:52,360
I am NOT going to be told lies about your own history by a fucking accountant. That's what this dude sounds like

705
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,280
He sounds like a fucking accountant Dan

706
00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:00,060
You're just saying that cuz the release the boogaloo is a real dorky joke to start off

707
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,320
Yeah

708
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,320
So Alex, you know

709
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,040
He's really making

710
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:15,000
Detente here sure and in a lot of ways he talks about he's talking about how like I had this bad feeling about Mike Dunn

711
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,680
But I was wrong

712
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:22,280
Well, I had Mike on yesterday and I got to say I thought he was probably a fed or some every law center

713
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:22,920
I didn't approve of that

714
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,880
I just a lot of these groups get led by those but I I didn't get that sense actually having him on I got the

715
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:34,320
sense he really believes in what he's doing and maybe I've been I'm not saying boogaloo's are perfect as any big organization can get

716
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:41,120
Infiltrated but that maybe you maybe you guys overall do have a good goal. My concern is are you guys acceleration is do you want a

717
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,360
revolution I

718
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,640
Mean we we have you not only that a revolution is inevitable. But yes, we want a revolution

719
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,380
It just depends on what form that takes we want it to be the most peaceful

720
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:57,680
People's revolution is humanly possible, but we're also not ignorant to the idea that the establishment's gonna go after that

721
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:04,440
They're gonna try to destroy it and they'll probably go on the offensive against us. So I just think that he's steamrolling Alex

722
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,520
Alex is just letting this guy

723
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,200
have a have a very friendly platform to

724
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,800
present this exactly how he wants to and it's it is

725
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
unacceptable

726
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,040
dissembling to be like we want a peaceful revolution but but no

727
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:24,880
No

728
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:31,720
That sentence ends with a period now if you want to continue that thought and say we want a peaceful revolution

729
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:38,440
Period we believe that there is going to be resistance to that. We will fight that

730
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:43,120
Peacefully, yeah, then that's cool. Yeah, there's there's two kinds of

731
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,920
approaches that I see being

732
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,280
Possible when you have something like this group that is really interested in

733
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:58,360
Gun concerns and what have you second amendment stuff? Yeah, you could have somebody who's like, okay

734
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:05,040
I disagree with open carry restrictions. So we're gonna get people together and we're gonna have an open carry March right, right

735
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,360
There's two things that can do two approaches

736
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:15,360
you can take one is that we expect we're gonna get arrested and then that arrest we will accept and we will use that to

737
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,840
try and

738
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:23,760
Change laws right change public opinion by virtue of our arrest seeming unfair to most people

739
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,320
Or you could take the approach of we're gonna do this and we're gonna threaten people with these cut

740
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:32,320
That would be the way to do it. And if people try and arrest us someone might get shot

741
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,720
Yeah, like I think the first

742
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:41,840
Might be productive right? The first one is something that even if I disagree with your position on the open carry laws

743
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:49,000
I don't see a problem with someone doing a demonstration and a protest like that. Yeah when it comes to like

744
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,320
Someone might get shot. That's that's when we're we're in dangerous territory. I mean, you know like

745
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,000
They're they're bullshit about unity and all that stuff

746
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,600
I I think immediately to of Fred Hampton like Fred Hampton

747
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:12,560
Was a person who went into these Second Amendment groups these fucking militia groups and was like hey

748
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:18,880
This is a class struggle. This is about us and convinced them and they joined him

749
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,280
Mm-hmm, and then they acted peacefully and that's why Fred Hampton was murdered

750
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,600
Because it was them moving to the left. Mm-hmm. If it's the other way around

751
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,960
Yeah, we're in trouble there. So Magnus believes and expresses that

752
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,520
Hey, the man is trying to get everyone to fight with each other, right?

753
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,260
Sure. Sure

754
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:42,600
Alex is like, yeah, okay, cool. Cool. Cool. Cool

755
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,620
But antifa they hate the cops, right? What about you guys? Okay

756
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,160
He does not get the answer. He wants I imagine so the

757
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:55,920
Establishment right now is trying to get everyone to fight and kill each other instead of coming together against them

758
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,840
They want all of these groups. They want antifa. They want three percenters

759
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,200
They want all of these groups to think the other side is the most evil thing in the world and it's you know

760
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,840
Secretly attempting to destroy them so they can laugh all the way to the bank while we fight and kill each other

761
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,040
Huh, and that's what we don't want. Well, there's no doubt that's going on

762
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,560
But I mean by you if it says the local police of the enemy. I mean, do you think that?

763
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:21,760
At this point. I find it hard to believe that the local police aren't the enemy like when when you look at gun confiscation

764
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,600
A lot of local police are just going along with that and not saying anything when you look at

765
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,400
Lockdowns when you look at arresting people over pot when you look at

766
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:35,440
Busting protests whether they be right-wing or left-wing protests very aggressively and laughing about it

767
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,960
I've you know, obviously I'm not saying that officer friendly in a small town

768
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,640
That's never done anything wrong is some horrible individual

769
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:48,320
But when you look at the institution of policing across the entire country, they've forsaken liberty in all directions

770
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:54,720
See what's interesting here is that Magnus is coming in with a complex thought

771
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,040
Yeah

772
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,320
That Alex can't really deal with well

773
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:06,040
He started with people are trying to divide the left and right and saying both sides are the most evil people on the planet

774
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:10,400
So they can never communicate with each other and while they're doing that they're laughing all the way to the bank

775
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,820
Right that reminds you of anyone did one thick-necked individual comes to mind

776
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,520
The exact person that he's talking to has spent all of his time talking about how antifa are

777
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:27,280
Meth-head demon spawn. Yeah, whatever. Yeah, the leaving that aside like yeah, I

778
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,080
Don't agree and I'm not gonna side with

779
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,240
Magnus but issues with

780
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,340
Policing are issues with police

781
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:42,300
absolutely, and Alex can try and deny that kind of stuff as much as he wants but you know

782
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:46,100
Magnus has a has a more interesting perspective on on

783
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:54,100
The police then Alex I I would counsel very hard to remember this motherfucker is lying

784
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:58,420
Yeah, he is. He's he's saying he's making well points. He's making good points

785
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:04,540
Maybe in the service of lies, maybe not lying because I do believe that he does have problems with police sure

786
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,900
It's disingenuous. Yeah, that's more I think

787
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:14,900
Lying about what his his his intentions. Yeah. Yeah. No, this is this is absolutely a fucking a

788
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:22,180
Bullshit way of being like see I listen to the problems on the left and we're gonna pay attention to them when they join us

789
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,740
we're gonna team up and solve those problems and

790
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:28,820
I don't know Dan. Have we seen what happens when?

791
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:35,380
Let's say right-wing grifters find something no longer useful a toss-it-aside

792
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,640
Yeah, I would suggest that if you were thinking about

793
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:45,500
Them having good points maybe remember what they do whenever you're no longer useful

794
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:45,980
Yeah

795
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:51,520
And I mean not for nothing in the wake of this dude being on Jimmy doors show

796
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:56,860
Some people did look through his Twitter and found him supporting Kyle Rittenhouse. Sure

797
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:02,860
It's like I don't know man. No, I don't know. Nah, it's unity. Yeah, we're all about unity

798
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,180
I don't know about this

799
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:11,720
So for Alex though, the question comes back to pretty constantly as it did with Mike. Who are you targeting?

800
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:18,780
I want to ask you about in a revolution and what your goals would be of that revolution or that new declaration of independence

801
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:23,980
And my concern is I never see people protesting big tech or I mean Apple runs

802
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,380
No factories in China, and I'm not saying Apple

803
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:34,020
I don't want that but but but I mean if Uyghurs bombed Apple, they would have a real argument Apple runs the main slave camps

804
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:38,780
So if Uyghurs attacked Apple, they would have a legitimate argument at the UN Hague that we're under attack

805
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:42,380
We were attacking who's attacking us. I'm not saying do that. I'm just saying all the time

806
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:47,660
I heard the local police that sounds like a communist takeover of local government. I'm not saying you're doing that

807
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:50,380
That's what I'm concerned about. Stay right there, sir. We'll come right back to you

808
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,980
No time for him to respond to that diatribe. Nope

809
00:54:54,700 --> 00:55:00,340
and again, it just comes down to Alex like his his his two issues seem to be like

810
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:07,100
This isn't being directed by me and you're not targeting the people that I want you to target. Yeah. Yeah

811
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,100
Yeah, my biggest issue

812
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:14,140
Is why isn't everybody doing what I say? Yeah, they can be as

813
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:20,620
Explicitly anti globalist like Mike Dunn was very clearly like I am against these global

814
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,500
global ists

815
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:27,340
And it doesn't matter because Alex doesn't see them blowing up

816
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:35,220
My stuff yeah, can you imagine that's what Trump in the Senate would be like, he's like why isn't everybody doing what I want to do

817
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:41,060
Mm-hmm. That's the whole thing. What's a quorum? I am a narcissist. I can't spell quorum

818
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:45,380
Yeah, so again announced quorum quokka. Yeah, Alex

819
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:50,540
You know, he his problem seems to be that like they have a revolution in mind

820
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,780
Revolution is probably good. You should do it. Yeah, but it's not my

821
00:55:55,380 --> 00:56:01,180
Revolution and kind of as a problem. Yeah, and then he makes an insane analogy. We had

822
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:06,180
Mr. Dunn on yesterday and I really thought about it after the interview. I thought I don't think that guy's a fed

823
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:10,180
I think he's really pissed off about what's happening in the world and trying to unify everybody

824
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,660
around

825
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:17,420
One message and if they can successfully do that, that'd be great. I'm just really concerned about

826
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:24,300
The goals of a revolution and and and who leads it. I mean, it'd be great if we had a bunch of state governors

827
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:32,700
And respected generals and respected lawyers and the Confederacy you're literally describing the Confederacy formed a new Declaration of Independence

828
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:38,720
That's 100% the Confederacy over. It's what are we doing over? It's illegitimate the great resets illegal

829
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:44,680
And so we you know reform our new Union and we have that right. I just see what happened at the Capitol

830
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:50,440
Which the Boogaloo's bragged about being part of people can try to walk that back whatever it was idiocy

831
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:55,080
I wouldn't call it an assault. I would call it a a pissing contest. I would call it me like a

832
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,960
Yeah, it was a little bit more intense than kind of that's what you call it

833
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,800
Other than them killing four citizens a cop have an heart attack Wow more intense

834
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:08,200
Than what you see in movies like Animal House

835
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:15,080
I mean, you know Animal House pranks are now like terrorism walking off of lecterns one cop got squashed in the door

836
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:21,080
There was some nasty to some fights. It was wrong, but not a new Pearl Harbor. So so so Magnus see

837
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,680
What you don't understand Jordan your mouth is open as if in surprise

838
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,320
But what you don't understand is that the storming of the Capitol was basically like, you know

839
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:34,160
How like in an old TV show, you know, like a panty raid sure. It's

840
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,600
Prank, so so what Alex also is quite inappropriate in hindsight

841
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:45,960
Is that the Patriots jumped the general Lee over the Capitol building? Mm-hmm. That's what we're describing here. Yeah

842
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,120
Yeah, I mean basically it's like teepeeing

843
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,680
Yeah, a lot of cops die when teepeeing. Yeah, basically

844
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,520
The the right-winger is just egged

845
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:00,800
Hey, what are you gonna do? We were throwing a little prank. Come on

846
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:06,880
Basically, they waited until the Capitol passed out and then they put the capital's hand in some warm water Wow Wow

847
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:13,440
Just while they waited until the capital passed out and then they put shaving cream on its hand and then tickled the capital with a

848
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,520
Feather I just don't know what to do when someone would try and say that

849
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:24,640
Like I just there's what just I want to get a white glove and challenge him to a duel

850
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:32,840
I don't know what to do about that. Yeah, I would say that if this is just the like slightly above frat pranks

851
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,600
Why are you talking about it so much? Oh, that's a good point

852
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,320
Also, I don't remember

853
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,560
Spending days and days trying to scapegoat a frat prank

854
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:50,520
Anyway, Alex has seen the interview with Jimmy Dore that this guy did and he loves it

855
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:56,960
And even before I even went on Jimmy Dore the only podcast I could even get on was a podcast called Liberty Lockdown

856
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:02,040
Which was a small decentralized podcast that they didn't have the ability to censor. Yeah, let's talk about that

857
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,080
That was a great interview you did with Jimmy Dore

858
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:11,440
yeah, and I'm so happy for him to have me come on because what has given me the ability to do is to break through all

859
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,200
the mainstream media lies about us because there's

860
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:22,040
extremist experts and journalists that have covered us all year long and have buck or a heels of video and text evidence showing what

861
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:28,160
our movements about and it doesn't line up with what the mainstream media has all and they'll they'll directly quote these

862
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:35,920
Extremist experts that work for DC and quote them on certain parts, but when those same extremist experts say no, we're not white supremacists

863
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,280
Yes, we work with BLM

864
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,880
They'll take those parts of their report and hide it and run us all rough shot across the media and I feel the same

865
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,200
Thing's been done to Antifa. I still feel the same thing's been done to three percenters

866
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,680
I feel like the same thing's been done to BLM. Fuck you. Yeah

867
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,280
Fuck you. Yeah

868
00:59:53,280 --> 01:00:00,380
Now if the criticism is that the mainstream media lacks some sort of nuance in reporting on groups

869
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,500
Particularly like the bugs. Mmm. Yeah, sure fine. Great

870
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,640
I

871
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,800
Don't know if you've broken through that by being on Jimmy doors. I would say no. No, I would argue

872
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:16,400
No, but then you know, this is gonna wind up with this dumbass being all over the place

873
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:23,580
I imagine a bunch of easily taken advantage of morons like Jimmy door. Yeah, and maybe maybe the

874
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:30,000
Sort of high point of it will be him going on Tucker. Yeah, yeah

875
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,360
But I don't I don't know if I don't know if he has the escape trajectory to get out of that bubble very much

876
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:43,000
But that is interesting. I mean like it does it does indicate like the kind of places that he has access to

877
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,720
Includes infowars. Yeah, Jimmy door. Yeah

878
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:54,160
Yeah, that should that should put pause in a lot of people's minds. It's not a good sign. No, no

879
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,680
Also, hey, buddy

880
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:01,920
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that most white supremacists would deny it

881
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:07,520
Yeah, and the the issue comes down to the the group is care

882
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:12,440
the character of the group itself is not white supremacist and a lot of I mean

883
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:17,680
Obviously there probably are a fair number of white supremacists who fall under the boogaloo

884
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,640
Oh, yeah category and that is fair enough

885
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:26,180
But the group itself is not white nationalist white

886
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:33,180
Supremacist in character right and that is something that's the nuance that is kind of difficult for people who aren't

887
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,700
Engaged in these things to really to really

888
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:43,780
Deliney and and that's where clunky conversations come in and you say like the white supremacist boogaloo group and then you

889
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,060
kind of look

890
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,060
Like you don't know what you're talking about

891
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:53,840
It's difficult even for me to fully understand where exactly a lot of the lines are

892
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,720
so Alex tries to have this conversation that is

893
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,640
far nicer than the one with Mike and

894
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:09,800
It's weird because the territory that Magnus is getting into should be really hostile stuff for Alex

895
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,800
Mm-hmm, like Magnus is

896
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:17,840
Defending antifa sure to Alex Jones indeed, and that's weird. This is a huge problem

897
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,600
Well, you believe in free speech antifa doesn't it's funded by Soros on record

898
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,600
I mean

899
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:31,120
That's the thing is like yeah that there might be infiltrated parts of it but you but that's the same for everything

900
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:36,640
That's something you talked about and like when I go back to like your early works about the WTO riots and how the police

901
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:40,600
Infiltrated the WTO riots to cause chaos and false flag

902
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:47,600
some of those same people that were at those WTO riots in Seattle are the same people that I talked to today that are part of

903
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:54,000
Antifa and they get really disillusioned when they hear things about like all of antifa's Soros funded a lot of them talk

904
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,840
Just like you they hate the Fed. They hate global, you know corporations

905
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,120
They stand for free speech

906
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:03,800
But Fox News or something will put the camera on one guy that has a stupid opinion and be like

907
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,520
Oh, they speak for all of antifa when it's when it's a global

908
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:11,920
I will invite any of those antiphon that'll actually talk to us. I'd love to actually hear that if that exists

909
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,960
This is a problem for Alex because he has contracts

910
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,680
No one is supposed to remember the things I say

911
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,840
Well, that's a problem

912
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:25,520
But also if Alex actually believed that the quote-unquote Soros

913
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:31,720
Antifa contracts the Harrison Smith found on 4chan were real right this argument should not be compelling to him

914
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,240
Yeah, this argument should be like no do you understand?

915
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,240
I have contracts between Alexander Soros

916
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:41,720
Excuse George Soros and their foundations and antifa in order to try and start martial law in America

917
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:50,120
You sir, don't know you're being tricked by the people on the ground who are who are old-time commies

918
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,120
Yeah

919
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,120
That's that's how you should be behaving

920
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:58,040
He shouldn't be he shouldn't be persuadable by stuff like this if anything that he believes means anything

921
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:03,240
Listen up Magnus Ver Magnusson or whatever your name is. Let me tell you this right now

922
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:08,320
Everyone in antifa had to sign a contract. I've got the document for you right here

923
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:13,320
Go ahead and read through that. Oh, no, I'm an idiot aren't I? Oh, no that guy remembered something

924
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:18,680
I said, I think that Alex probably doesn't bring that stuff up because Magnus would laugh in his face

925
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:24,160
I don't think that it would be embarrassing. That's why Alex's narratives fall apart

926
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,960
Yeah, like because they're built on nothing. Yeah, Alex himself doesn't believe them and

927
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:36,120
When presented with somebody who probably isn't gonna play along. This is what I keep coming into. Is that like Alex?

928
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,120
should not

929
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,720
Engage with zealots. Yeah, he's a pretend zealot

930
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:44,740
Yes, and he's going to get found out when you go up against a real one

931
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:45,080
Yeah

932
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,160
The end and that's why he can't bring out his real

933
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,880
Narratives that uses all the time on his show because they'd be punctured so fast

934
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:58,760
He's at an instant disadvantage and somehow he still believes when he has these people on that. He's like nah, I got him

935
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,200
I can take care of it. Well stupid

936
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:09,320
so anyway, the great reset is the problem or something sure there needs to be a revolution probably and Magnus wants Alex to

937
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,320
Work with Antifa, of course

938
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:18,140
We should be able to unify everybody against the great reset is literally a corporate takeover to consolidate power under the name of environmentalism

939
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:23,920
To literally bankrupt everyone and and have a universal income so they can dictate the terms of our surrender

940
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:30,760
We have got to get everybody mobilized against the great reset. What is your view Magnus about the great reset? Oh, yeah

941
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:36,200
And I agree and it's funny enough because I had this conversation with an Antifa member. They agree, too

942
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,380
It's not that they're against the idea of like oh, let's reset the system everywhere

943
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:46,520
But they are perfectly aware of the people that are pushing that idea of how all these multinational billion-dollar banks and everything

944
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:51,080
It's not a great. Yeah, I love a reset exactly. We need a reset. We need a reset exactly

945
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:56,360
I'm gonna hold you over but we need a reset but it's not this reset. This is a horrible reset. Sorry go ahead

946
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:03,600
there's a difference between a reset that involves rethinking our approach to climate issues rethinking our

947
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,320
approach to what

948
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,920
people need to live

949
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:13,780
That kind of thing and a reset that involves a civil war. Yeah

950
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,800
Yeah, those are very different and if you talk about them being like, oh well

951
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,880
Hey, these people are interested in a revolution just like us

952
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,640
You're muddying the waters in a way that is incredibly unfair

953
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:26,960
Yeah

954
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:33,820
and that is like when you engage in that kind of a disingenuous sleight of hand it leads me to

955
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:38,560
Suspect that maybe a lot of the stuff that you're saying is not sincere

956
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:45,200
Yeah, not genuine and that's one of the problems that I run into with Magnus and in this next clip

957
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,360
I think we really get to see this pretty clearly

958
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:53,160
Actually, I was just on the phone with the woman that was at the WTO riots

959
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,480
And she said she would would be willing to come on and talk to you

960
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:59,720
So if you want to talk to an Antifa member, you can talk to an Antifa member, please

961
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,400
And definitely like obviously the

962
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,960
Dictionary definition of acceleration nascent ism might be correct

963
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:11,480
But what everyone is calling us if by if by the criteria that you think everything is

964
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:16,880
Fundamentally flawed and it will not change without radical change then literally everyone is accelerationist

965
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:21,520
Joe Biden is an accelerationist AOC is an accelerationist Rand Paul's an accelerationist

966
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:26,360
Like if you look at the world through that view everyone acknowledges that things are totally

967
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:31,720
Destroyed across the board when it comes to civil liberties, when it comes to our economics, everything

968
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:36,280
Exactly. So like a lot of people say like, oh you want a revolution? You're an accelerationist

969
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:41,880
I'm like everyone wants a revolution right now. Everyone's talking about it. It trends on Twitter constantly. So this is

970
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:43,640
another

971
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:51,280
Manipulative sleight of hand. Oh, yeah, the accelerationism that people are talking about when they talk about fringe right-wing groups and militias

972
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,840
And and and that type is an accelerationism towards shooting violence

973
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:03,240
it's an accelerationism that's rooted in heightening tensions and highly tense situations and

974
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:09,840
protests that have the potential to spin out of hand and prove to be an inciting event in a

975
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,680
conflict between a

976
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,680
Supposed

977
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:20,120
Sides of a civil war we see the water boiling and we want to push it over the edge. That's the

978
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:25,240
accelerationism that he's trying to make the same as

979
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:33,600
Accelerationism where you have people who are saying climate change is a problem that cannot be ignored any longer. Yep

980
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,200
we need to

981
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,200
elect leaders who are willing to

982
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:43,600
Explore ideas about regulation. Yes. Okay. It's not the same

983
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:53,400
Recognizing that a system is flawed in many ways and we're past the point possibly even past the point where we can

984
01:08:54,280 --> 01:09:02,440
totally fix all of the issues sure is not the same as thinking everything is fucked and we should hope for a civil war because

985
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:06,480
It's gonna happen eventually. So why not do it now? I

986
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
That's dishonest

987
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:15,560
100% I I mean, yeah, I I understand this guy and you're you're 100% right good cop bad cop

988
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:20,680
Bullshit with these two but God I prefer the asshole from the other day

989
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:26,060
It's funnier cuz he and also he's just gonna be like, yeah, fuck. Yeah, let's blow it up

990
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:30,720
You know, like I don't like this lying piece of shit coming at me with his accountant

991
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:35,280
But I think that Mike was still lying too. Oh, he was still trying to put on a

992
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,640
Shiny or facade Oh 100 to what he actually is believing and promoting

993
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:43,720
but yeah, this this is

994
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:52,120
Just intrinsically on like unfair. Yeah. Yeah, like what he's what he's presenting and it's it's intentional

995
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:58,040
Because he kind of understands that there's a lot of Alex's audience. That's probably poachable

996
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:02,960
No, and it's hard to it's like bring up AOC and all I think of is

997
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:08,320
Ted Cruz being like yeah agree and AOC being like hey you tried to murder me go fuck yourself

998
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:10,360
Well, guess what? I get it

999
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:16,120
You can bring up how antifa and BLM are also against the Fed or whatever it is you want

1000
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,880
But you tried to murder all of us. So go fuck yourself

1001
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:25,860
well, but the and the other problem too is that I do I I do think that there probably are some

1002
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:33,540
accelerationist types on the left sure you can rationalize I'm sure way to that like if you take the issue of like

1003
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:39,880
Climate change you can find eco-fascists. You can find eco-terrorists. Yeah

1004
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:43,240
that's not the mainstream of

1005
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,140
And and you know

1006
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:52,140
I would say that probably the boogaloo boys are a little bit outside of the strict mainstream of the right

1007
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:59,980
But they're closer than eco-terrorists are to the mainstream of the left. Yes, I would agree a great deal and and and comparing

1008
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,540
You know, I don't know. I don't know if he would do this but

1009
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,100
Comparing like I don't know

1010
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:08,140
gun wielding

1011
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:12,340
Accelerationists to protests to Greta Thunberg. I think it's a

1012
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:16,500
Little bit different. Yeah a little bit different. I remember Greta

1013
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:19,220
bringing in her AR to the

1014
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:26,820
UN I remember that didn't she do that when she gave that speech? Yeah, I recall so Magnus wants peaceful

1015
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:29,680
options sure now again

1016
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:35,860
Did you leave a public representative of a group that is entirely based around the fantasy of a second Civil War?

1017
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:38,140
to the point where

1018
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:43,940
This listener pointed this out to me and I knew this but I failed to bring it up on our last episode

1019
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:48,560
You know, even the wearing Hawaiian shirts is about Civil War

1020
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:55,580
It's they had to get around social media bands. And so they had big luau instead of boogaloo. Yep

1021
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,620
Like everything is about every day. Yeah, but he wants peaceful options

1022
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:01,520
Okay

1023
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:08,460
And I think that he is one Alex over to an embarrassing extent and we need to keep trying to push peaceful options

1024
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,820
We need to keep finding cracks in the armor to be peaceful

1025
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:17,860
But they continue to shut those avenues down one after another another if they keep doing that and that was my warning to them

1026
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,860
In that speech if they keep denying people

1027
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:23,340
Redress keep denying people the ability to change things

1028
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:29,620
Then you're going to have civil conflict and it's going to be really bad for them for us and for everyone involved

1029
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:34,820
Come back on cuz I'm really impressed and I'm glad that you actually came on

1030
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:36,860
I'd love to have you on with the antifa lady

1031
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:41,780
We want to have them on we want to actually reach out to these folks as I understand that we can all drink the mainstream

1032
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:45,740
Media kool-aid at a certain point need to actually hear what these groups actually stand for

1033
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:50,060
You're not drinking the mainstream media kool-aid. It's your kool-aid. Yeah

1034
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:55,980
Magnus has got Alex so on the ropes that he's willing to work with antifa. Yeah

1035
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:03,540
Doesn't China run antifa? It's just it's hard not to see that like oh well

1036
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:08,980
You're just nicer to Alex, you know, like he of course he agrees with all of this shit

1037
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:15,460
Theoretically in his mind, you know, but this guy's being nicer than Mike Dunn. So well

1038
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:20,580
Yeah, you guys might have a good point. You're being real deferential and I don't see you as a physical threat

1039
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:26,100
So I think we're good to go who knows like how this would have gone if Magnus was the first one

1040
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,300
Yeah, talk to Alex

1041
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:32,700
But I I don't think that this interview can be seen outside of the context of the prior one

1042
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,020
Yeah

1043
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:38,820
That went very badly for a hundred percent and it's not like I mean you'd have to be delusional to think that Mike

1044
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,820
And Magnus don't know each other. Yeah

1045
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:49,900
The night between these two interviews about Alex get him believe you call them a controlled opposition to his face. What a moron

1046
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:53,260
Okay. Now I'm gonna go on and tell him that antifa is cool

1047
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:56,220
I saw I saw one interview he did with Steve pachannik

1048
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:59,980
All you got to do is say that he's a good dude who's super smart and then don't believe anything

1049
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:01,980
yeah, this is embarrassing and

1050
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:07,620
Alex is just stupid. Yeah, so bad. So speaking of

1051
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:09,620
a dangerous bad

1052
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:13,020
Interviews now Stuart Rhodes of the Oath Keepers comes in great

1053
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:17,420
good work Alex is not into this idea that some of them got arrested and

1054
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:19,940
It's just kind of like I don't buy it

1055
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,420
shifting gears Stuart Rhodes is a

1056
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:31,100
Retired constitutional lawyer award-winning researcher you name it. What awards do army veteran patriot founder of Oath Keepers?

1057
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:35,180
It's always about non-violent defensive protection of America

1058
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,440
Since we've seen the big news three Oath Keepers

1059
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:42,820
Arrested plotted to kill members of Congress. They do a very good job. They're at the Capitol just running around

1060
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:49,060
Whoa, I don't buy any of that. They all went woo. Woo. Woo. They were like Jeffrey Osborn

1061
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:54,420
Can you whoa, whoa, whoa, you know that song it is it's kind of astonishing

1062
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:59,340
do you remember how quickly don't talk about Jeffrey people hand wave a

1063
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,900
literal violent coup yeah, it's

1064
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,380
astonishing

1065
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:10,940
Well, it's so important for people like Alex and people on the right to do that because it's so indicative of

1066
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:18,680
The sort of danger that they present to a civil insane society. Someone could say that the enemy is with it

1067
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:25,900
It's very important that the hand waving happens. I just don't understand why people who

1068
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:29,720
Are on the other side don't keep stressing this

1069
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:34,440
In in in a really aggressive way cowardice money

1070
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:40,960
I think I think maybe but I think also just kind of like we all are just exhausted

1071
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,640
That's part of just fucking tired this goddamn

1072
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:48,160
Pandemic and then these guys took over the country and all I want to do is go to bed

1073
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:53,740
Yeah, a lot of the time whenever I'm you know, getting an episode ready Alex will say something. I'm like

1074
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:59,060
Oh, yeah, yeah, and then I have to like deal with it

1075
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:04,020
Yeah, and I think that sometimes in life you run into walls like that and you just don't want to deal with it

1076
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:04,460
Mm-hmm

1077
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:10,700
I think that maybe some people don't want to deal with that and hand waving is the good way to do it

1078
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:15,140
I mean when you but for Alex, it's it's an existential threat. Yes 100%

1079
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:23,360
Recognizing that his worldview implies this yeah is is really dangerous. This is the logical conclusion of what you say

1080
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:28,360
Mm-hmm the end this is not some like infiltration. This is not some like oops

1081
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:31,320
We were meaning to do this and then this happened

1082
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:36,600
This is what the end goal was and you did it stupid and you lost. Mm-hmm the end

1083
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:42,400
Unlike Jeffrey Osborne who won I was doing so hard

1084
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:48,200
I'm not so hard. I was just zeroed in on not talking about that in terms of awards

1085
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:52,560
Stuart Rhodes, I don't know what the case is here

1086
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,040
He when he was at Yale

1087
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:59,680
He apparently won an award for a paper on enemy combatant status that he wrote

1088
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,740
I was able to find the paper and it's long

1089
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:07,520
And I didn't read all of it, but I read some of it and I was like, yeah, this seems like a college paper

1090
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,520
yeah, and

1091
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,960
It would have been I think 2004

1092
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,960
and conveniently

1093
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,000
Yale

1094
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,240
Their records online go back to 2005. Oh

1095
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:27,080
So weird. Yeah, so I was able to find the recipients list of these winners until 2005

1096
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:31,840
That's not to say that Stewart didn't win it. I just know I'd sure sure sure. Yeah, he could have

1097
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,920
It reminds me of Mumford the movie Mumford. Oh

1098
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,840
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I fakes being a

1099
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:46,360
Psychologist. Yeah conveniently everybody who could verify his time in college died. So weird. Yeah, so weird

1100
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:49,200
Yeah, we've we've met some people like that in the past

1101
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,760
so

1102
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,560
Stewart is kind of like hey

1103
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:01,520
We're in the situation that our founding fathers were in and so what we need to do is set up autonomous cities

1104
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:07,880
I think okay, make sure you do what the founders did they came together. They were united the town and county level

1105
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,040
for mutual defense and also for

1106
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:17,760
Grassroots politics they separated themselves from an illegitimate regime even before they declared independence, you know

1107
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,120
They didn't listen to the real governors

1108
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:25,040
They they smuggled and went around all the edicts of the king and they wore a homespun clothing

1109
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,740
Stop buying textiles from England. They

1110
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:33,940
That's like moonshine. All of this is pure Americana. I agree everybody. They're trying to drive us underground

1111
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:38,060
Let's jump in that briar patch. Let's just let's just stop supporting them in any way

1112
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:45,160
Alex is currently in a luxury resort in Utah. He has an iPhone in his pocket

1113
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:50,340
This is this is ridiculous God. Yeah, I hate these people so much

1114
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:55,980
It's it's a bit of a mess, but not as much of a mess as Alex's narrative about January 6th

1115
01:18:55,980 --> 01:19:01,460
Yes, this is a huge problem for him because as we've seen he's had to gradually expand the narrative

1116
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:03,580
based on

1117
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:07,980
New people who get arrested. Yeah, we're on our seventh or eighth iteration of this narrative

1118
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:12,140
Yeah, and it's falling the fuck apart. Yeah, and one of the reasons for that is

1119
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:17,220
The people that he's tried to blame the boogaloo boys stood up to him

1120
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:20,820
Oh, and he got embarrassed by two of them in two days

1121
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:28,140
Yeah, he can't throw the oath keepers under the bus. He's too connected to them. Stuart Rhodes is his good buddy

1122
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:31,140
Yep, they're they're tight. He can't do it

1123
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:37,860
The proud boys. He also probably can't throw them under the bus completely. Joe Biggs was like the second-in-command

1124
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:43,580
He used to work at Infowars, Enrique Tarrio. Yeah, they were independent contractors. He never met him

1125
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:46,100
He doesn't get into that kind of stuff that those people get in

1126
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:51,500
Enrique Tarrio had been on the show before he spoke at Alex's CPAC event. You can't prove any of this

1127
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:55,380
Alex could be like I was in bed drunk

1128
01:19:56,740 --> 01:20:01,140
He probably could. I don't remember Tarrio. I don't remember anything from that night

1129
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:30,880
It's too difficult for him. And so now he has to kind of like do this. Welcome back ladies and gentlemen. Stuart Rhodes founder of the Oath Keepers is here with us and he just learned about this in the last 12 hours or so. Self-styled militia members in three states begin planning in November for recruits, weapons ahead of capital, and

1130
01:20:31,140 --> 01:21:00,500
breach US siege. Well, they sure didn't bring the weapons and they sure didn't do all the things they supposedly were planning to do. But it was the Q phenomenon behind the scenes that oh secretly Trump's giving orders to storm DC and all this and then it would piggyback on us having peaceful demonstrations, calling for a Senate investigation that Ted Cruz was calling for. And then you get to demonize the entire Trump system with this badly coordinated few hundred people that wanted to storm the Capitol.

1131
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:13,220
Hell, you get a few Proud Boys, you get a few Boogaloos, you get a few Oath Keepers in the mix. Are they informants? Were they set up? They break in. Okay, four of them get killed. Cop has a heart attack, dies two days later. This is the new Pearl Harbor.

1132
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:36,180
So the narrative now is just so intensely complicated and shifted so far over the course of the last couple weeks that to imagine somebody continuing to go along with this is just embarrassing. Because Alex at every stage has said he's proven all of these things and then everything shifts.

1133
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:55,780
So now Q, the Q movement is the real villain. And there's a couple of people who I guess Alex will probably, I'm gonna guess soon he's gonna say Sheepdipped. He's gonna call these people Sheepdipped. There's gonna be a couple Sheepdipped people in each of these groups that were there as infiltrated provocateurs.

1134
01:21:55,780 --> 01:22:06,580
And so all these groups are actually good, just they had a couple people who were bad apples in those groups who were actually globalist plants. This is too complicated.

1135
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:20,580
I guess he has too many Q followers that listen to his show, but if it were me I would just go hard on Q being controlled by the globalists the whole way. Turn all the Q people into globalists.

1136
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,020
No, that's kind of where he's at.

1137
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:28,900
Right, but I mean straight up clean break. Everything is their fault because they're the globalists.

1138
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:42,580
Sure. Well, that's interesting. I think it would be difficult to argue that all the people who believe in Q are aware of a globalist plot that they're a part of.

1139
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:43,220
Sure.

1140
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:48,100
And so he's saying that the Q is globalist intelligence and stuff like that.

1141
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:48,740
Right.

1142
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:56,980
But the people who fell for it and were in on it, or the followers, they're just good researchers who got taken down the wrong path.

1143
01:22:56,980 --> 01:23:06,740
I know, but you can lump them in with all the people who use it. You know, most rank and file Democrats aren't evil people. They've just been caught up in this whole thing. You just rationalize the Q.

1144
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:09,300
Alex says that everyone on the left is a devil.

1145
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:11,620
Well, sometimes he does and sometimes he doesn't.

1146
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:12,500
Depends on his mood.

1147
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,140
Exactly.

1148
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:20,420
Yeah, I don't know. I strain to keep any kind of...

1149
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:21,140
Through line?

1150
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:23,780
Well, yeah, through line or belief that Alex even has a through line.

1151
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:24,820
Yeah, I would agree with that.

1152
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:30,980
I don't think he has a center on this narrative. It's just someone's to blame and it's not us. It's a fake group that's controlled by the globalists.

1153
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:35,540
That's why I'm saying you go with Q and then you go up against a Boogaloo boy and they're like,

1154
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:45,060
you're stupid and you're like, no, no, no, this is all Q shit, man. You are the stupid ones. You are being controlled by the globalists who run Q.

1155
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:50,900
I don't know. I think Alex realizes that the new generation is not going to put up with his bullshit.

1156
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:52,420
No, that doesn't seem like it.

1157
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:58,260
So, Stuart Rhodes is not like Alex in many ways. He's scarier.

1158
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:58,820
Terrifying.

1159
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:03,860
And he also is not somebody who throws people under the bus.

1160
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:04,340
That's true.

1161
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:10,260
Alex is willing to throw anybody under the bus immediately. When it's convenient, bus.

1162
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:17,220
Yeah, I imagine that military service will give you more loyalty to your comrades in arms than

1163
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,220
being a radio host.

1164
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:26,820
Yeah, so one of the people that was arrested, Storm in the Capital, one of the three Oathkeepers,

1165
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:32,420
Stuart Rhodes knows for a fact, is an Oathkeeper. And he won't deny that. And he also spent some

1166
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:34,500
time on this show promoting her crowdfunding.

1167
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,020
Yeah, I love that. I love it.

1168
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:40,980
Jessica Watkins does have a GoFundMe set up or not a GoFundMe. It's on rally pay,

1169
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:46,500
but a fundraiser for her. We do encourage people to go and defend the actual Oathkeeper member

1170
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:50,820
who was involved in that. So we always stand behind our people. So there you go.

1171
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:53,860
But again, you didn't coordinate. You weren't part of this.

1172
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,540
No, absolutely not.

1173
01:24:55,540 --> 01:25:00,820
I had nothing to do with it. Now I am going to try and help fund the defense of somebody

1174
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:09,060
who is there because they're my people. That is a kind of loyalty that is foreign to Infowars.

1175
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:15,140
Completely. So wait, wait, wait. Are you saying that she did a thing that you personally think

1176
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:21,380
was a bad idea, but you're still going to defend her? But if you threw her under the bus, then

1177
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:23,540
maybe you wouldn't have to deal with it at all.

1178
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:24,740
Yeah, you could keep that money.

1179
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:27,460
Yeah, it'd be your money. Don't you want that money?

1180
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:33,860
So we are now in a situation that is exactly the same, 100% the same.

1181
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:35,540
Identical to the founders.

1182
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:39,620
Well, the colonies. In the colonies. We're basically in the colonies.

1183
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:39,860
Okay.

1184
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:43,780
Stuart, what do you expect them to do with Biden? He's deteriorating

1185
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:47,700
extremely quickly. I mean, he looks like an Alzheimer's patient now. I mean,

1186
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:51,940
they definitely cranked him up and he practiced that very short inaugural speech, which was okay.

1187
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:52,660
10 bags of blood.

1188
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:54,500
Other than that, he's like, what am I signing?

1189
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,780
Blah, blah, blah. I mean, he is like, what the hell's going on here?

1190
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:05,220
Well, like I was saying, he is a Chinese puppet. You should look at this as DC is now the green

1191
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:11,940
zone of an occupying army from communist China using their puppet. And that's why it's a direct

1192
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:16,500
parallel the founders faced. They were dealing with domestic puppets, the royal governors,

1193
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:21,540
who were doing the bidding of a foreign power that was king in parliament that the people had

1194
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:26,020
no control over and no representation in. And we're in the same exact position.

1195
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:27,620
Exact same position.

1196
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:31,540
Exact same position. Explain to me how they're in the exact same position.

1197
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:33,460
Stuart just did, man.

1198
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:35,700
I disagree strongly.

1199
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:42,740
Sure. Me too. So Stuart is, you know, he's not an accelerationist except he is.

1200
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:47,380
Pretty sure he said we're in the colonies and I'm pretty sure that what that required was a

1201
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:48,420
literal revolution.

1202
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:51,540
Yeah, but before that they had people writing pamphlets and stuff.

1203
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:55,860
Oh, so the Oath Keepers are very similar to Thomas Paine.

1204
01:26:56,500 --> 01:27:01,220
One might, one were they to be Stuart Rhodes might say yes.

1205
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:09,300
Stuart, he's trying to have this like, you know, like, hey, it's not time for action or whatever

1206
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:16,500
yet, but he does give a little bit of a contradictory message here and it's upsetting.

1207
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:21,060
That shows their weakness because they can't even trust their own troops because they know

1208
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:26,500
that those troops come from us. And so what they do is try to purge the troops and kick

1209
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:31,300
out anybody who's a real American. They really have a skeleton force of no strong military

1210
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:35,380
in the United States that is controlled by them than to have a powerful military they

1211
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:39,540
can't control when they when they try to give orders to violate our rights. So watch for

1212
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:46,500
that. We're going in territory heading towards a sweet spot where we can't wait too much

1213
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:51,700
longer because then they'll have vetted and kicked out all the patriots out of the military.

1214
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:52,180
Confederates.

1215
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:55,780
They have not gotten there yet, but watch for that process to happen. As you get closer

1216
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:59,460
and closer to that point, you have to do something. That's where we're going.

1217
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:03,460
That's right. Let's talk about, both of you stay there, let's talk about the timeline

1218
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:06,820
of tyranny, what the Globals are going to do next, what we've got to do. I mean, folks,

1219
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:10,420
nobody's happy about this. A country has cancer. Again, they're trying to purge the

1220
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:14,500
military now. We told you that was coming next. And now it's here. We got to take the

1221
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,660
last three minutes of Stewart, put that on the front of this interview. That was

1222
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:22,420
where he let it out. Literally, DC is now the commonest Chinese green zone. We'll be

1223
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:23,220
right back.

1224
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:29,140
So you have Stewart saying that there's a sweet spot that is, you know, like where you

1225
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:34,260
have to do something before the military is done purging. Also the military has started

1226
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:34,740
purging.

1227
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:36,420
Well, that puts a clock on it.

1228
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:36,980
It does.

1229
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:38,340
It sure does, doesn't it Dan?

1230
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:40,340
This is the revolution QVC.

1231
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:45,700
We're not into acceleration. What we are saying is that it's going to happen shortly.

1232
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:49,060
Anybody, we got about 45, 50 minutes?

1233
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:50,900
Yeah, that's not good.

1234
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:51,460
Yeah.

1235
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:54,900
So the 28th wraps up and...

1236
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,180
Blackjack! Shit.

1237
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:56,820
Nope.

1238
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:57,700
You're so good.

1239
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:58,820
You're so good at this.

1240
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:01,620
29th, Alex is, like I said, on the road.

1241
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:01,940
Yeah.

1242
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:02,660
He's coming back for Utah.

1243
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:03,140
Travel day.

1244
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:10,500
30th, sorry, Alex and Stewart Rhodes are in studio and they're talking about this dumb

1245
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,380
documentary, talking about how they got us a seed and shit.

1246
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:13,700
Yeah.

1247
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:14,340
Very stupid.

1248
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:14,980
Yeah.

1249
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:21,940
Now we get to the 31st Sunday episode and Alex is basically describing how we're in

1250
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:22,580
Revelation.

1251
01:29:22,580 --> 01:29:23,300
Okay.

1252
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:28,500
But it is said in the book of Revelation that John the Revelator in the Isle of Patmos

1253
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:35,460
marveled at the beast, looking forward through an interdimensional wormhole that God opened

1254
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:35,860
up.

1255
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:37,140
That part wasn't in the Bible.

1256
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:39,940
The Antichrist and the world government, what would be happening in the future.

1257
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:42,340
He marveled at the beast.

1258
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:46,660
World government cannot buy nor sell without a mark on the forehead of the hand.

1259
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:48,980
You must turn over your children to the state.

1260
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:51,380
You must destroy your very genetics.

1261
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:52,260
You must kill the earth.

1262
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:56,100
You must worship Satan or you will not be allowed to live.

1263
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:58,580
You'll not be allowed to have a job.

1264
01:29:58,580 --> 01:30:04,100
Well, whether you believe John was the greatest science fiction writer ever 2000 years ago.

1265
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:04,740
He was not.

1266
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:07,380
Or whether you believe he was inspired by God.

1267
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:07,940
He was not.

1268
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:10,580
It's being manifested.

1269
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:12,340
It is not.

1270
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:15,140
It's being set up right now.

1271
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:21,780
So the old Chinese proverb says, may you live in interesting times.

1272
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:24,820
And we certainly are interesting times.

1273
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:27,540
And then you have the battle of Armageddon with the dragon.

1274
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:31,860
All the rest of it now unfolding.

1275
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:40,660
So get your popcorn out because you got front row seats to the big finale.

1276
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:44,820
Is it 10 years, 100 years out or 60 minutes away?

1277
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:47,380
All I know is it's satanic and it's moving quick.

1278
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:48,820
Wait, so it might be in an hour.

1279
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:52,900
The dragon might be here in an hour.

1280
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:53,220
Okay.

1281
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:55,540
Okay, so this is not fair.

1282
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:56,660
I've got a pitch for you.

1283
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:59,620
Actually, I've got a pitch for the devil or the great beast, if you will.

1284
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:00,340
Hold on, hold on.

1285
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:01,940
Let me, let me get into character.

1286
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:03,860
Okay, there you go.

1287
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:05,140
That was scary.

1288
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:06,980
You surprised me.

1289
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:08,020
She popped out of that portal.

1290
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:08,500
Okay.

1291
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,980
So you've got the book of revelations.

1292
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:15,860
You've got this whole like head or the hand on the mark of the beast, right?

1293
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:19,860
But you're the devil and you realize everyone has a phone.

1294
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:23,940
Hmm, so do you get around the entire book of revelations?

1295
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:29,140
If you just never attach it to somebody's hand or forehead, do you just win?

1296
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:32,420
Does he win if everybody has the mark of the beast in their pocket?

1297
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:38,420
Well, I mean, it would certainly seem to indicate that the prophecy was a little bit screwy.

1298
01:31:38,420 --> 01:31:38,900
Yeah.

1299
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:39,540
Oh, yeah.

1300
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:42,260
What about like, um, I don't know.

1301
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:45,620
Like there's so much that, uh, aren't in any of those prophecies.

1302
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:48,420
Like, uh, like, uh, custard.

1303
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,780
That's true.

1304
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:50,500
Well, I don't know.

1305
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:53,780
Maybe custard existed back then.

1306
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:54,900
What am I trying to think of?

1307
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:56,260
I have no idea.

1308
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:58,820
I don't know where custard came from at all.

1309
01:31:58,820 --> 01:32:00,100
French fries?

1310
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,140
They did not have those.

1311
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:02,020
Pizza?

1312
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:02,660
That's true.

1313
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:04,100
They didn't even have France back then.

1314
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:07,700
I don't know what I'm trying to get at.

1315
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,620
They were called gall fries back then.

1316
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:13,620
There were, there, there were some, some things that were missing, uh, from the,

1317
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:17,540
in terms of it being a wormhole vision of the present.

1318
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:18,660
Uh, but yeah, I don't know.

1319
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:22,420
I just think it's unfair for Alex to be like, it could be a hundred years, could be an hour.

1320
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:23,540
Get your popcorn out.

1321
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:26,900
You might die before it starts, but you'll have the popcorn ready.

1322
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:30,500
The devil's here and it's happening and it's happening fast.

1323
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:31,380
Or in a hundred years.

1324
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:32,100
And who knows?

1325
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:35,940
So, uh, the big news is, uh, vaccine related.

1326
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:36,260
Yes.

1327
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:37,300
On Sunday.

1328
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:41,860
And it's that, uh, Australia has ended, uh, its COVID development program.

1329
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:43,860
So now here's the big announcement.

1330
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:50,340
A month ago, Australia suspends nationwide, their entire vaccine program, because it's

1331
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:55,700
makes people deathly ill, killed a bunch of people and they came up positive for HIV.

1332
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:58,100
Well, we put that on screen place for TV viewers.

1333
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:07,700
Now, now, ladies and gentlemen, last Tuesday seems like a hundred years ago,

1334
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:12,980
Merck, the largest pharma company in the world says we are ending our vaccine program.

1335
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:14,100
It does not work.

1336
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:18,980
We believe you cannot make a vaccine that works to cure the common cold.

1337
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:22,820
And that's what this is, except it's chimera with even more mutations.

1338
01:33:22,820 --> 01:33:24,340
So it's even more impossible.

1339
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:27,780
Alex is a sort of editorializing on what these companies have said.

1340
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:30,260
He's adding a little bit there on his own.

1341
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:30,500
Yeah.

1342
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:33,060
I would say, I would say that wasn't a direct quotation.

1343
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:33,380
Yeah.

1344
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:36,500
The other problem too, is that these are all different vaccines.

1345
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:37,700
There is that.

1346
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:41,780
Like the one in Australia was developed by the university of Queensland and a biotech

1347
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:47,860
firm called CSL and the ones that Merck are different, the ones they were working on.

1348
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:51,860
And those are also different than the Pfizer and the Moderna ones.

1349
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:53,620
Nah, they're all fake.

1350
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:54,660
It's all fake vaccines.

1351
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:56,500
Alex is treating them like they're all the same thing.

1352
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:57,540
They're all the same thing.

1353
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:01,060
It's a syringe with some liquid in it, Dan.

1354
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:01,940
It's the same shit.

1355
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:03,220
It's very weird.

1356
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:03,460
Yeah.

1357
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:04,660
It's a weird perspective.

1358
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:07,060
It's kind of like he doesn't understand anything about them.

1359
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:07,460
Yeah.

1360
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:08,820
So I actually lied to you.

1361
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:09,860
That's not the news.

1362
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:12,020
That's the preface for the news.

1363
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:14,500
The big news has to do with Emmanuel Macron.

1364
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:14,900
Okay.

1365
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:17,060
French president has come out and said some things.

1366
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:20,820
Who came out yesterday, Macron, a top globalist.

1367
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:23,940
But he understands that this is such a crime.

1368
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:25,300
He'll be torn limb from limb.

1369
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:26,820
The riots are gigantic.

1370
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:28,820
All their scientists are coming out saying, this is insane.

1371
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:30,100
The top ones.

1372
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:32,180
As opposed to the other ones?

1373
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:36,340
The discoverer of HIV, who's a French scientist and saying, it's man-made in the lab.

1374
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:37,060
It's a power grab.

1375
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:42,100
I told you months ago, I talked to the head of a major biotech company that has real gene

1376
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:44,500
therapy that cures things like colon cancer.

1377
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:45,860
They also sell pillows.

1378
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:47,140
And he said, you're absolutely right.

1379
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:49,460
It's a giant total takeover.

1380
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:54,260
The vaccine will destroy and sterilize women, and it will kill your immune system or turn

1381
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:55,940
it way off the charts and give you cancer.

1382
01:34:57,780 --> 01:34:59,300
But they need to want to come on the show.

1383
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,660
Oh, too bad.

1384
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:01,060
Yeah.

1385
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:08,340
For somebody with knowledge that could potentially save billions of people, it seems like he

1386
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:10,180
would want to get that information out there.

1387
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:10,580
Yeah.

1388
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:13,300
I guess he's now responsible for...

1389
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:14,820
I'm pretty sure he's killed us all.

1390
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:21,380
So French President Macron said that the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine appears to be, quote,

1391
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:27,860
quasi-ineffective in people older than 65, which is a claim that scientists have strongly

1392
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:28,580
rebutted.

1393
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:29,940
What about the top ones, though?

1394
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:31,220
I don't know what that means.

1395
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:31,700
Okay.

1396
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:35,780
Macron did not come out against the vaccine or vaccination, nor is he trying to save himself

1397
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:37,300
from being torn limb from limb.

1398
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:42,340
Also, this is not the same vaccine as the ones put out by Pfizer and Moderna, which

1399
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:45,060
are the ones that are currently available in the United States.

1400
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:49,940
The claims that Alex is making are absurd, and it's super convenient that this big time

1401
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:52,820
specialist with magical medical technology won't come on the show.

1402
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:54,980
But honestly, this is just dumb.

1403
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:57,460
One of the things that's the most dumb about this...

1404
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:58,660
Drum roll, please, Jordan.

1405
01:35:58,660 --> 01:36:00,580
Okay.

1406
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:01,380
Good enough.

1407
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:06,020
The AstraZeneca vaccine that Macron is talking about isn't an mRNA vaccine.

1408
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:06,500
Well...

1409
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,860
But Alex doesn't know that.

1410
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:12,180
If you were a member of the InfoWars audience, you would think that all these vaccines that

1411
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:16,180
were getting developed were all the same thing, as if a ton of companies were just racing

1412
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:17,860
to finish the same recipe.

1413
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:19,620
But that's not the case.

1414
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:23,780
These are different approaches being taken with varying levels of success and setbacks.

1415
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:27,620
Alex doesn't understand the basics of the topics he's covering, and he doesn't care

1416
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:30,340
to, because his work is not meant to reflect reality.

1417
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:31,940
It's meant to push an agenda.

1418
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:32,500
Yeah.

1419
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:38,580
And this is just really sad, because all his ideas are about mRNA vaccines being different

1420
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:39,780
than vaccines.

1421
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:41,940
And that's why this is particularly evil.

1422
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:43,300
And Macron knows that.

1423
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:48,260
And that's why he's getting rid of this Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine that it turns out isn't

1424
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:49,620
an mRNA vaccine.

1425
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:50,980
But Alex doesn't know that.

1426
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:58,340
Macron claims that the vaccine that they were going to use is an mRNA vaccine.

1427
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:03,780
AstraZeneca is almost ineffective in over 65s.

1428
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:05,060
Alex doesn't know shit.

1429
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,180
He doesn't know anything.

1430
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:07,540
He's talking out of his ass.

1431
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:09,780
And so this is how arguments get made.

1432
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:14,420
So Australia, Merck, France does not work.

1433
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:15,460
Does not work.

1434
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:16,500
Does not work.

1435
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:17,540
Does not work.

1436
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:18,500
Does not work.

1437
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,700
Does not work.

1438
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,140
That's it.

1439
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:23,300
That's the level of shit he's bringing to the table.

1440
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:24,180
That's compelling.

1441
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:24,500
Yeah.

1442
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,700
That is compelling.

1443
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:31,140
I remember going to my first year.

1444
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:34,580
I didn't originally start out in literature.

1445
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:37,140
I originally started out in audio production.

1446
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:41,220
And I was there, and I was looking at the board, going through all this stuff.

1447
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:44,580
And I remember my teacher screaming at me, it works!

1448
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:45,140
It works!

1449
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:46,340
Yeah.

1450
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:46,820
It works!

1451
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:53,380
Yeah, I think that part of the game that's being played here is like, the audience is

1452
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:55,220
obviously humans.

1453
01:37:55,220 --> 01:38:02,580
And they think that if someone is yelling this repeatedly, over and over again, so definitively.

1454
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:03,460
He believes it.

1455
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,540
He can't possibly be making this up.

1456
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:09,460
How could you be this confident and make something up at the same time?

1457
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:10,580
People can't do that.

1458
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:12,420
It's not possible, Dan.

1459
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:14,260
It's simply inconceivable.

1460
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:15,860
And unfortunately.

1461
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:16,420
Here we are.

1462
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:17,140
Yeah.

1463
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:23,060
So Alex has some staggering statistics about this vaccine that I would beg him to demonstrate.

1464
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:25,460
Guess who the vaccine's killing?

1465
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:28,500
Not just the famous baseball player.

1466
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:29,700
Hank Aaron.

1467
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:31,940
The vaccine killed him?

1468
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:35,540
Local news every day of 20-year-olds, 50-year-olds, 60-year-olds, 30-year-olds.

1469
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:38,820
Take it and die before they even leave the clinic.

1470
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:39,460
They collapse.

1471
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:43,460
And then have a convulsion and bye-bye an hour later.

1472
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:47,300
Bye-bye, Bluebird.

1473
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:48,660
But it gets even more insane.

1474
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:53,860
I mean, this is absolutely the biggest criminal power grab ever.

1475
01:38:55,380 --> 01:39:01,060
They are reporting in hospitals and in nursing homes that up to 5% of the patients are dying

1476
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:03,860
within a week when they take the mRNA shot.

1477
01:39:04,420 --> 01:39:05,300
Holy shit.

1478
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:09,540
5% fatality rate?

1479
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:11,140
Alex, you need to demonstrate this.

1480
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:12,740
That's an outrageous clinic.

1481
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:14,180
This is an arrestable offense.

1482
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:18,180
That is a legit, like, there should be a legal...

1483
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:19,380
I mean...

1484
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:20,260
That's insane.

1485
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:20,740
You could.

1486
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:26,980
I mean, you'd need to somehow demonstrate that, like, him saying that people believed

1487
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:30,820
it and it led to harm, but I don't think that that...

1488
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:33,060
Like, I don't know how you'd prove it, but I believe it.

1489
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:33,300
Yeah.

1490
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,060
Like, I believe that that causes harm.

1491
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:36,100
Absolutely.

1492
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:37,140
Without question.

1493
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:39,140
5% mortality rate?

1494
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:40,740
Without question.

1495
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:41,700
That's outrageous.

1496
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:43,140
That's fucked up.

1497
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:44,340
So fucked up.

1498
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:45,940
That's a made up number.

1499
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:48,900
That would be the number one story in history.

1500
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:56,580
Culmination of all of humanity's knowledge about infectious disease results in 5% of

1501
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:58,260
people dying immediately.

1502
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:03,780
Yeah, I don't think that you get to make claims like that willy nilly.

1503
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:05,940
And he is.

1504
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:09,940
Yeah, if you can't yell fire in a crowded theater, you can't tell everybody that they're

1505
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:10,820
gonna die.

1506
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:11,140
Yeah.

1507
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:11,620
Yeah.

1508
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:15,300
So the vaccines are a bio weapon, apparently.

1509
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:20,660
And I would like to stress this important point that I've brought up that I don't think

1510
01:40:20,660 --> 01:40:27,540
that Alex knows or cares that these vaccines are all different vaccines and some are not

1511
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:29,620
mRNA vaccines like he thinks.

1512
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:32,740
They're closing in to shut everybody down right now.

1513
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:34,500
We have to expose their behind this.

1514
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:38,260
We have to expose the criminal takeover plan and we have to get world leaders, starting

1515
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:42,580
with governors and starting with senators to come out and point this out and it's game

1516
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:42,980
over.

1517
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:44,980
Well, what do you think Merck knows?

1518
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:45,620
What do you think?

1519
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:46,740
Macron knows?

1520
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:52,340
What do you think the Australians know suspending their vaccine programs because it quote does

1521
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:54,420
not work and hurts people.

1522
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:56,980
Quote because it does work.

1523
01:40:56,980 --> 01:40:57,700
Macron.

1524
01:40:57,700 --> 01:40:58,580
It does work.

1525
01:40:58,580 --> 01:40:59,140
Merck.

1526
01:40:59,140 --> 01:40:59,860
It does work.

1527
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:00,500
Australia.

1528
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:05,060
It's a frickin bio weapon.

1529
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:11,780
The mRNA vaccines are gene therapy and they train your body to attack a protein that's

1530
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:12,420
in the placenta.

1531
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:15,300
All four of the damn things are the same thing.

1532
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:19,540
Well, one of them, at least, that you were bringing up isn't an mRNA vaccine.

1533
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:20,820
Well, there's that problem.

1534
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:23,540
And that whole thing about attacking the placenta is nonsense, but-

1535
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:24,100
There is that.

1536
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:26,580
I just, I don't know.

1537
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:28,580
This is desperate.

1538
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:29,140
Yep.

1539
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:29,700
Yep.

1540
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:35,300
Anyway, we don't have time for us to all wait.

1541
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:40,740
The inevitable thing that's going to happen, as has always happened, is that Alex says

1542
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:44,820
something, it sounds silly, and then 20 years later, what do you know, Alex is right.

1543
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:45,780
Always comes true.

1544
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:46,740
Always.

1545
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:52,100
We're living in exactly what Alex predicted we would be in 1991.

1546
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:58,660
If there's one thing I've learned from doing this podcast, it's don't ever forget

1547
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:00,340
don't ever doubt Alex.

1548
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:05,140
His shit stands up to scrutiny.

1549
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:05,640
True.

1550
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:08,580
He's right almost all the time.

1551
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:12,340
Even when it contradicts other things he's almost always right about?

1552
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:13,220
Yeah, yeah.

1553
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:16,020
Be very facetious.

1554
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:18,340
Never believe Alex.

1555
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:21,220
He's very dumb and mostly is just talking shit.

1556
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:24,260
Half the time, he doesn't even remember the shit he says.

1557
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:25,140
Doesn't care.

1558
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:27,300
But we don't have time to wait for him to be proven right.

1559
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:31,300
We need to act on the things that he's saying now, and just trust that in 20 years

1560
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:33,700
we'll look back and be like, thank god we listened to Alex.

1561
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:37,060
I just don't trust people who make me want, who say I should do that.

1562
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:37,700
No.

1563
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:39,300
Very, very dangerous types.

1564
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:40,020
Yeah.

1565
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:44,500
We don't have time for people to say 20 years later Alex Jones was right again.

1566
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:45,460
Or a year later.

1567
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:47,460
We gotta get that it's not about who's right.

1568
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:49,940
The enemy has written books and laid out their plans.

1569
01:42:49,940 --> 01:42:51,300
Of course I know their plans.

1570
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:52,660
It's so easy to beat them.

1571
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:54,420
It's a complete criminal takeover.

1572
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:58,900
They said in Operation Lockstep, 11 years ago, Rockefeller Foundation, which John Hopkins,

1573
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:01,380
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, go read it.

1574
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:02,180
It's online.

1575
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:03,700
We do.

1576
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:10,180
They bring in a planetary police state by disease X, something like a weaponized cold

1577
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:14,180
virus, and that there'd be no way to ever defeat it.

1578
01:43:14,180 --> 01:43:18,420
We could teach people to be tracked, controlled, and locked down, and that new variants would

1579
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:21,780
show up all the time so that the lockdown would never end.

1580
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:23,060
It's just making that shit up.

1581
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:24,500
It's just making that shit up.

1582
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:25,000
Yep.

1583
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:26,500
So yeah, I don't know.

1584
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:29,460
Disease X actually has adamantium claws as well.

1585
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:29,780
True.

1586
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:30,260
Yeah.

1587
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:36,820
In 20 years, we'll look back and be like, wow, I can't believe that this was okay.

1588
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:37,380
Yeah.

1589
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:38,820
This guy got away with this shit.

1590
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:40,980
That's my prediction.

1591
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:41,220
Yeah.

1592
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:47,700
So if you want to look at what he's saying now and sort of think about like, okay, you

1593
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:49,620
think that you're going to be proven right about everything.

1594
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:50,420
Sure.

1595
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:51,620
Here's the kind of shit he's saying.

1596
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:54,180
This is an exact plan.

1597
01:43:56,900 --> 01:44:01,140
They teach in elementary school in Germany, we played the actual training videos, that

1598
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:05,540
when you're seven years old, you should be prepared to marry a Muslim by 14.

1599
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:10,180
You should be dating a Muslim by 10, and that Muslims will be the future of Europe and that

1600
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:11,220
Christianity is bad.

1601
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:12,820
I can show you those newscasts if you like.

1602
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:15,860
I would like to see those newscasts.

1603
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:17,140
I would like to see those.

1604
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:18,020
Don't think you can.

1605
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:21,220
That would be a very funny video to share on the internet.

1606
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:26,500
Where the Germans are teaching elementary school kids, hey, you're behind if you're

1607
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:28,420
not dating a Muslim by fourth grade.

1608
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:30,980
Hey, 11 year old, what are you doing single?

1609
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:33,140
You old maid.

1610
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:34,180
You old maid.

1611
01:44:34,740 --> 01:44:36,500
You'll never get married at this rate.

1612
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:39,620
You're in sixth grade.

1613
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:42,260
You should just get some cats.

1614
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:42,580
Yeah.

1615
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:45,620
And I see that as somebody who has a cat and I love my cat and there's nothing wrong with

1616
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:46,340
having cats.

1617
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:46,500
Yeah.

1618
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:52,420
Yeah, this is the kind of shit that Alex says, horribly bigoted nonsense.

1619
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:53,140
Yeah.

1620
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:57,140
Anyway, the globalists, as we know, 10 years behind.

1621
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:58,900
Yes, always.

1622
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:00,660
It might just be a few years behind now.

1623
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:02,180
What about plan B?

1624
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:06,500
Plan B, Alex never said that stuff.

1625
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:07,060
Oh, okay.

1626
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:07,700
Didn't happen.

1627
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:08,200
Okay.

1628
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:10,340
They're behind.

1629
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:12,420
Listen to this.

1630
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:14,180
I have a lot of thoughts on the other side of this.

1631
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:14,740
All right.

1632
01:45:14,740 --> 01:45:15,620
And here's the deal.

1633
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:21,060
They were supposed to have the whole internet shut down with independent media like us before

1634
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:21,540
they did this.

1635
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:23,700
They weren't planning to launch this for a couple of years.

1636
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:25,700
They launched this early because they're behind schedules.

1637
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:27,620
They thought they'd catch up by launching early.

1638
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:28,900
What?

1639
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:29,860
Some future plans.

1640
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:30,980
What?

1641
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:33,940
But all these different globalists know that everyone hates them now.

1642
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:35,860
I mean, Bill Gates is the most hated man on earth.

1643
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:36,900
Then it's Klaus Schwab.

1644
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:37,700
Then it's Macron.

1645
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:42,420
Then it's the British prime minister that turned out to be a total traitor, Boris Johnson.

1646
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:43,140
Oof.

1647
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:45,700
So he's talking about the releasing of COVID.

1648
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:46,020
Yeah.

1649
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:47,220
Release the COVID.

1650
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:48,420
He actually even says that.

1651
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:49,460
Release the COVID.

1652
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:55,940
But the idea that he's putting forth is that the globalists were a few years behind.

1653
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:56,260
Right.

1654
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:58,660
And so they had to pick up some time.

1655
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:03,300
Super evil worldwide organization that has orchestrated everything.

1656
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:03,620
Right.

1657
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:04,660
Still a few years behind.

1658
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:04,980
Right.

1659
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:07,940
And this is a plan that goes back to the devil.

1660
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:08,180
Yes.

1661
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:09,460
And the beginning of history.

1662
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:09,940
Yes.

1663
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:11,060
Thousands of years back.

1664
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:14,180
I do appreciate that the devil cannot keep a timetable.

1665
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:14,420
Right.

1666
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:16,020
Just behind a little bit.

1667
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:16,900
Just behind.

1668
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:17,460
He's the devil.

1669
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:18,420
What, is he going to work hard?

1670
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:19,940
I mean, in the song, he's behind.

1671
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:21,860
That's why he got kicked out of heaven.

1672
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:23,060
That's why he went to Georgia.

1673
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:24,660
Too lazy.

1674
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:26,260
They have a real slow pace down there.

1675
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:26,980
He's way behind.

1676
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:27,300
Yeah.

1677
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:28,100
Looking to make a deal.

1678
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:39,060
So this plan that is millennia old and has to do with Trump staying in office or something.

1679
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:39,700
Sure.

1680
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:40,980
They're behind on it.

1681
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:41,540
Yeah.

1682
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:43,300
They're behind on this evil plan.

1683
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:46,900
And so they decide to release COVID a couple of years early.

1684
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:47,300
Sure.

1685
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:49,540
A couple of years early because they got to make up that time.

1686
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:51,060
What's the point of having a plan?

1687
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:52,740
What's the point of a few years?

1688
01:46:54,260 --> 01:46:59,220
Honestly, if you have a millennia old plan and you're only a few years off,

1689
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:02,180
6,000 years later or whatever, that's really efficient.

1690
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:04,020
No one's going to remember that.

1691
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:05,460
That's really efficient.

1692
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:09,940
Yeah, a few years in this scale of time is meaningless.

1693
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:10,580
Yeah.

1694
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:12,100
You're at a work project.

1695
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:14,420
It's supposed to last a year and you're three months behind.

1696
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:16,260
People are furious at you.

1697
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:16,660
Right.

1698
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:16,900
Yeah.

1699
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:20,900
So they release COVID a couple of years early to pick up some time.

1700
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:21,380
Sure.

1701
01:47:21,380 --> 01:47:22,180
Seems dumb.

1702
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:22,660
Sure.

1703
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:23,540
Seems stupid.

1704
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:27,700
Hey guys, we're not ready yet for this plan that's going to end the world.

1705
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:29,140
I figure we just go for it.

1706
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:29,780
Yeah, why not?

1707
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:31,140
Yeah, we got a 50-50 shot.

1708
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:33,940
So now the problem is that Alex is still on air.

1709
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:38,980
They were meant to have the internet cracked down by the time that they released this thing.

1710
01:47:38,980 --> 01:47:39,620
Right.

1711
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:39,860
So...

1712
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:43,860
So why didn't they?

1713
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:44,180
Yeah!

1714
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:46,420
I didn't get a reason for why they did.

1715
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:47,380
That's my problem.

1716
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:48,580
Why are they behind?

1717
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:49,780
Why didn't they shut down?

1718
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:52,020
Can they not?

1719
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:55,380
So the goal and the motivation is to make up some lost time.

1720
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:55,860
Right.

1721
01:47:55,860 --> 01:48:01,060
But the plan that they're engaging in requires that the internet be shut down

1722
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:02,500
to be pulled off successfully.

1723
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:02,900
Correct.

1724
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:05,780
So why would they do this thing to catch up on time

1725
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:08,900
that they don't have one of the essential pieces in place for?

1726
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:09,380
Right.

1727
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:10,660
So dumb.

1728
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:12,260
Okay, so here's our plan.

1729
01:48:12,260 --> 01:48:18,740
It can only be stopped if we allow independent media to reveal our plans and stop everything.

1730
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:19,140
Right.

1731
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:21,700
That, by the way, I'm glad we're having this meeting.

1732
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:21,860
Yeah.

1733
01:48:21,860 --> 01:48:26,100
That is a crucial first step in terms of us being able to pull off this nefarious plan.

1734
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:29,540
I would argue it's the only step we can take.

1735
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:32,740
If we wanted to go early, it would only be that one.

1736
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:34,100
I'm glad we're all on the same page.

1737
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:34,420
Yes.

1738
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:34,820
Yeah.

1739
01:48:34,820 --> 01:48:35,940
So release the COVID.

1740
01:48:40,340 --> 01:48:41,860
Alex will destroy our plans.

1741
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:42,260
Yeah.

1742
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:42,900
Certainly.

1743
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:46,820
And we will not only not make up time, we will lose time.

1744
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:47,620
We will be set back.

1745
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:49,220
We'll lose forever.

1746
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:53,780
We'll be set back to devil times.

1747
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:54,180
Yeah.

1748
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:55,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1749
01:48:55,220 --> 01:48:58,740
Our plan will have to go, we're gonna have to do a page one rewrite on this evil plan.

1750
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:03,300
Yeah. John of Patnos is about to marvel at our great beast and then he's just gonna go

1751
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:05,380
back in and the seals are gonna close again.

1752
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:07,940
Cause we forgot to shut down the internet.

1753
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:08,420
Fuck.

1754
01:49:08,420 --> 01:49:08,900
Damn it.

1755
01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:10,260
You know what?

1756
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:11,060
This is on us.

1757
01:49:11,060 --> 01:49:11,300
Yeah.

1758
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:15,540
We can't claim ignorance on this one.

1759
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:18,020
We knew that Alex was gonna fuck us up.

1760
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:21,380
We do like that there are exit interviews for the higher echelons.

1761
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:21,620
Oh shit.

1762
01:49:21,620 --> 01:49:23,540
Just like, sorry guys, this one's on me.

1763
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:23,940
Yeah.

1764
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:24,820
This one's my bad.

1765
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:26,580
I'll take credit for it.

1766
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:31,700
So anyway, this is just catalog this in the Alex's plans of the globalists make no sense.

1767
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:32,260
Yeah.

1768
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:32,580
Yeah.

1769
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:34,100
They're real bad at what they do.

1770
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:34,740
They're real bad.

1771
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:34,980
Yeah.

1772
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:36,420
It's almost like he's making it all up.

1773
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:41,700
So, um, one of the things that got everyone really excited over the weekend was there

1774
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:47,700
was a piece in the wall street journal about Alex being involved in the funding of the,

1775
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:48,100
uh,

1776
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:50,260
Stop the steal January 6th.

1777
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:50,740
Yes.

1778
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:51,060
Yeah.

1779
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:51,620
Yes.

1780
01:49:51,620 --> 01:49:57,780
And I read that article and I don't think, uh, that Alex comes off looking that terrible.

1781
01:49:57,780 --> 01:50:02,100
I mean, it's just, you know, organizing and fundraising and stuff.

1782
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:05,380
I think Ali Alexander obviously looks like way more of a creep.

1783
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:06,500
That's kind of cause he is.

1784
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:06,740
Yeah.

1785
01:50:06,740 --> 01:50:08,180
He's a real dangerous lunatic.

1786
01:50:08,180 --> 01:50:08,820
Uh huh.

1787
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:10,020
Um, but

1788
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:13,380
Somebody should give him a radio show and then maybe the profit incentive will keep

1789
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:15,140
him from being too much of an asshole.

1790
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:15,700
Possibly.

1791
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:16,340
Yeah.

1792
01:50:16,340 --> 01:50:21,380
Um, Alex responds to this piece on the wall street journal and I think he responds

1793
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:23,140
exactly how I did.

1794
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:26,260
And that is, I said all of that stuff on air.

1795
01:50:26,260 --> 01:50:26,500
Yeah.

1796
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:30,900
So there's hundreds of articles, TV shows, all breathlessly.

1797
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:41,860
All breathlessly saying, Oh, January 6th rally funded by top Trump donor helped by

1798
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:43,700
Alex Jones organizers say.

1799
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:48,020
And it's word for word.

1800
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:51,380
What I said, day one, Trump wanted to rally the six.

1801
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:52,900
Nobody would step up with the money.

1802
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:59,140
I stepped up, put 80 something thousand dollars down to try to secure the venues.

1803
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:02,420
Cause you got a park service won't even let you authorize the permit unless you show

1804
01:51:02,420 --> 01:51:05,460
you're going to have security and porta potties and all the stuff.

1805
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:09,700
And then a well-known donor heard I was doing it in contact and I was handing them

1806
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:12,820
over to her big Republican fundraisers and to them.

1807
01:51:12,820 --> 01:51:19,780
And they tried to turn that into a big conspiracy that I was planning to try to do

1808
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:24,260
all of this so that we could storm the Capitol.

1809
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:27,140
From my perspective, I think Alex is kind of right.

1810
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:27,460
Yeah.

1811
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:30,420
But I think that this reveals a couple of really funny things.

1812
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:35,940
Um, first of all, like just the, the idea that he's like, why are they, I, I said

1813
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:37,540
this and he did.

1814
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:37,780
Yep.

1815
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:42,580
He's constantly said a lot of the stuff that's in that wall street journal article

1816
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:46,660
and the sort of revelations of it are things that you would know if you listen

1817
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:47,300
to info wars.

1818
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:47,700
Yeah.

1819
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:54,340
Now, the thing that I think is really funny is like, let's say January 8th, Alex

1820
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:58,660
has been talking about this and that he had paid for part of this rally.

1821
01:51:58,660 --> 01:51:59,140
There's that.

1822
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:03,460
The wall street journal would never report on that cause it's just Alex saying it.

1823
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:03,620
Yeah.

1824
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:06,020
That's fair.

1825
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:06,500
Yeah.

1826
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:07,540
That is fair.

1827
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:09,140
Alex is an unreliable witness.

1828
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:10,980
I can't believe anything this guy says.

1829
01:52:10,980 --> 01:52:11,300
Yeah.

1830
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:15,460
Our source is Alex Jones and it's about Alex Jones and I don't believe a word of

1831
01:52:15,460 --> 01:52:15,620
it.

1832
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:16,100
Of course.

1833
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:23,140
So there's a story in the wall street journal now cause someone else said it.

1834
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:24,100
I don't know.

1835
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:28,820
I think that would almost be something that Alex should be called as a witness

1836
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:30,420
at Trump's impeachment trial.

1837
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:31,860
He thinks he's going to be.

1838
01:52:31,860 --> 01:52:36,180
I mean, he did just say that Trump told him, you know, I didn't have a hard time.

1839
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:40,660
He's putting himself in the center of that impeachment trial too because of this

1840
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:42,100
wall street journal piece.

1841
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:45,460
And, but he's also saying like, they'll never call me as a witness because I

1842
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:46,740
tried to stop the storming.

1843
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:48,340
Oh, I'll call him as a witness.

1844
01:52:48,340 --> 01:52:51,700
I'll call you as a witness any day of the week, buddy.

1845
01:52:51,700 --> 01:52:53,060
I want to get you in that stand.

1846
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:53,780
Oh, it'd be fun.

1847
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:59,300
Only way to make the impeachment trial more ludicrous would be to invite Alex

1848
01:52:59,300 --> 01:52:59,620
Jones.

1849
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:02,180
Alex, can I remind you you're under oath?

1850
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:04,340
I don't even know what that means.

1851
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:04,580
Yeah.

1852
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:08,420
So I think it's really funny that the, like a lot of the underlying information

1853
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:15,060
of this article is stuff that was public prior, but also maybe bullshit.

1854
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:16,660
Not proven, not proven.

1855
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:17,780
Yeah, it's not proven.

1856
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:24,740
And so the second thing that I think is really funny is that the article says,

1857
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:29,620
quote, Mr. Jones personally pledged more than $50,000 in seed money for a planned

1858
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:34,260
January 6th event in exchange for a guaranteed top speaking slot of his

1859
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:38,900
choice according to a funding document outlining a deal between the company,

1860
01:53:38,900 --> 01:53:41,220
his company, and an early organizer for the event.

1861
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:42,820
So Alex was doing pay to play.

1862
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:43,300
Of course.

1863
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:46,820
He was putting down money in order to get a speaking slot.

1864
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:47,300
Yep.

1865
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:48,820
That's wild.

1866
01:53:48,820 --> 01:53:50,260
That's kind of embarrassing.

1867
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:51,060
That's sad.

1868
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:55,380
In the article, it seems like that's him paying for access.

1869
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:56,100
Yeah.

1870
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:58,660
Yeah, there's clout and there's money and you don't have clout.

1871
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:03,700
And there was no way that Alex was going to get a speaking slot at Trump's

1872
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:04,420
actual event.

1873
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:05,460
No, good God, no.

1874
01:54:06,100 --> 01:54:09,220
So, I mean, I figure he did speak the night before.

1875
01:54:09,220 --> 01:54:10,580
That might've been what he paid for.

1876
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:13,380
Wow.

1877
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:13,860
Yeah.

1878
01:54:13,860 --> 01:54:17,540
Kind of a bummer, but I do think that those two things in the Wall Street

1879
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:19,380
Journal article are pretty funny.

1880
01:54:19,380 --> 01:54:23,540
The unreliability of Alex to even speak about his own life and the fact that he

1881
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:25,060
has to pay to get a speaking slot.

1882
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:30,980
It is weird how you can both fall so far and yet at the same time inspire a

1883
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:33,220
literal overthrowing of a country.

1884
01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:33,860
It is.

1885
01:54:33,860 --> 01:54:37,540
That's an interesting up and down kind of scenario there.

1886
01:54:37,540 --> 01:54:38,420
It is interesting.

1887
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:38,980
Yeah.

1888
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:45,060
So we end this episode now, Jordan, with evidence of why Alex should never

1889
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:51,220
have to pay to speak somewhere as long as he's forced to speak over a certain

1890
01:54:51,220 --> 01:55:05,460
song.

1891
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:09,140
You can face it.

1892
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:13,780
I understand powerful men.

1893
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:18,340
Most of them never do anything in their lives because they're ashamed of their

1894
01:55:18,340 --> 01:55:18,660
power.

1895
01:55:18,660 --> 01:55:21,540
They don't want to force their way to the front.

1896
01:55:21,540 --> 01:55:22,420
They're humble.

1897
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:23,700
They love their family.

1898
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:25,300
They love their friends.

1899
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:26,180
They love their community.

1900
01:55:26,740 --> 01:55:28,580
And so they defer to others.

1901
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:31,060
You can't do that.

1902
01:55:32,740 --> 01:55:34,420
You belong in charge.

1903
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:39,620
You belong in charge of your life, your family, your destiny.

1904
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:44,340
And if you don't take control, this evil corrupt system that's laughing at us

1905
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:50,020
will I call on men to start acting like men.

1906
01:55:51,380 --> 01:55:56,660
I call on men to follow the basic code God wrote on your soul and to stop

1907
01:55:56,660 --> 01:56:00,660
following with fallen men that put out because they're not following God.

1908
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:02,900
They are falling the fallen one.

1909
01:56:05,060 --> 01:56:05,460
All right.

1910
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:08,420
You know, I didn't just have all these articles and all these video clips.

1911
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:10,020
Yes, you did.

1912
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:12,740
Yes, you absolutely did.

1913
01:56:12,740 --> 01:56:15,060
That's why that's why you would say that.

1914
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:15,460
Of course.

1915
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:22,180
That was not the best work he's done over that song, but pretty okay.

1916
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:25,220
There were moments of the flickering passion.

1917
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:29,780
I would listen to a cover album of him sing talking what he thinks the lyrics

1918
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:30,740
to songs are.

1919
01:56:30,740 --> 01:56:32,340
I don't want him to do that.

1920
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:34,900
Although I do think that would be interesting as a side project.

1921
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:38,580
I want an album of just that song, 12 tracks.

1922
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:39,060
Yeah.

1923
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:40,580
Just that song.

1924
01:56:40,580 --> 01:56:45,620
But different days, Alex, just Alex's greatest hits, freestyling.

1925
01:56:45,620 --> 01:56:47,620
Yes, whatever is on his mind.

1926
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:52,740
This is like a great thesis at the beginning of this.

1927
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:54,820
I know about powerful men.

1928
01:56:54,820 --> 01:56:55,620
Go from there.

1929
01:56:55,620 --> 01:56:56,100
Go for it.

1930
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:56,740
Just see what happens.

1931
01:56:56,740 --> 01:56:57,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1932
01:56:57,540 --> 01:56:58,100
Just write it.

1933
01:56:58,100 --> 01:56:59,940
You love that goddamn saxophone.

1934
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:00,820
Everybody loves that.

1935
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:02,580
I'm talking about Alex.

1936
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:03,620
He loves that saxophone.

1937
01:57:03,620 --> 01:57:04,420
Oh, he does.

1938
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:06,020
It does something to him.

1939
01:57:06,020 --> 01:57:06,980
It does something to me.

1940
01:57:06,980 --> 01:57:07,460
Yeah.

1941
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:08,660
We were both dancing.

1942
01:57:08,660 --> 01:57:10,740
We did, I didn't hear much of what he said.

1943
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:12,180
I was too busy singing along.

1944
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:13,780
That is a sultry ass song.

1945
01:57:13,780 --> 01:57:16,900
It is a great track.

1946
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:18,340
It's a banger of a track.

1947
01:57:18,340 --> 01:57:21,300
I mean, it's no Zamfir, the lonely shepherd.

1948
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:29,460
But yeah, it clearly puts Alex into some kind of a zone where it's like, it's time to blow

1949
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:29,780
hard.

1950
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:30,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1951
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:31,540
It's time to be...

1952
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:34,180
No narratives right now.

1953
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:39,940
I'm just going with straight, inspirational fucking clear eyes, full hearts, belong to

1954
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:40,340
the city.

1955
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:41,700
I can see the horizon.

1956
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:42,740
Yeah, 100%.

1957
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:44,260
Absolutely.

1958
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:48,580
Alex talks a bunch about being able to kick himself into a psychic state, and I don't

1959
01:57:48,580 --> 01:57:49,220
believe that.

1960
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:51,220
But that song kicks him into something.

1961
01:57:51,220 --> 01:57:51,620
Something.

1962
01:57:51,620 --> 01:57:52,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1963
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:58,420
So we come to the end of this exploration, Jordan, and I'm left with sort of a bad taste

1964
01:57:58,420 --> 01:58:02,260
in my mouth for Alex and his January 6th narratives.

1965
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:07,380
I think it'll be interesting to see, as we get closer to the impeachment, how Alex keeps

1966
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:12,980
probably trying to egg Trump into turning it into some kind of a circus.

1967
01:58:12,980 --> 01:58:13,380
Yeah.

1968
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:18,340
And what ends up happening with that will be fascinating to watch Alex deal with.

1969
01:58:18,980 --> 01:58:22,660
But I do worry about his malleability.

1970
01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:31,060
The fact that he can have these people, the Boogaloos, that he decided were a FBI cutout

1971
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:37,300
group, and he said he'd proved all this, and then have two of them on to manipulate him

1972
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:39,220
and embarrass him in different ways.

1973
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:40,340
So easy.

1974
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:42,980
It's just, it's a mess.

1975
01:58:42,980 --> 01:58:43,480
Yeah.

1976
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:46,180
Yeah, I imagine that this is...

1977
01:58:46,820 --> 01:58:54,500
I think what scares me most about this is how easily they are hand-waving away what

1978
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:58,260
even Alex was like, this is going to fuck everything up.

1979
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:01,860
You know, like, Alex is, I got to back away from this.

1980
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:04,980
This is all, this, I know this is bad for me.

1981
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:10,340
I know that this January 6th takeover of the fucking country is bad for me.

1982
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:10,820
Yeah.

1983
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:14,820
And it takes two weeks for people to convince me that, eh, you guys are great.

1984
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:17,460
Yeah, that's not good.

1985
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:19,940
Well, no, because he's trying to have it both ways too.

1986
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:25,060
He's trying to retain that this was bad, but also like all of the actors who were actually

1987
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:29,940
involved in it aren't bad, there were just a few people in their organizations who were

1988
01:59:29,940 --> 01:59:32,900
secret globalists who were trying to make them look bad.

1989
01:59:32,900 --> 01:59:34,660
It's too complicated.

1990
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:39,540
No, he's still trying to run interference for people who are going to do what he wants

1991
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:40,260
them to do.

1992
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:45,780
Yeah, in the same way that Stuart Rhodes is gonna still fundraise for his Oathkeeper folks

1993
01:59:45,780 --> 01:59:53,220
who stormed the Capitol, Alex is making it very clear that if you kiss the ring, sort

1994
01:59:53,220 --> 01:59:59,780
of, or if you'll play ball a little bit, I will pretend that all the members of your

1995
01:59:59,780 --> 02:00:03,460
group who do bad things are not really part of your group.

1996
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:04,020
Yeah.

1997
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:05,140
Yeah, exactly.

1998
02:00:05,140 --> 02:00:07,220
And that's stupid.

1999
02:00:07,220 --> 02:00:08,100
That's fucked up.

2000
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:08,500
Yep.

2001
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:08,820
Yep.

2002
02:00:08,820 --> 02:00:09,940
But expected.

2003
02:00:09,940 --> 02:00:10,740
100%.

2004
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:14,340
Anyway, sorry the episode's late, we'll be back with another episode at the end of the

2005
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:14,660
week.

2006
02:00:14,660 --> 02:00:15,060
Indeed.

2007
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:16,420
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

2008
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:18,100
We do have a website, it's knowledgefight.com.

2009
02:00:18,100 --> 02:00:19,780
Yep, we're also on Twitter.

2010
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:22,900
We are also on Twitter, it's at knowledgefight.net, go to bed Jordan.

2011
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:26,260
Yeah, we'll be on Facebook in the future.

2012
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:28,020
We'll be on Facebook someday.

2013
02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:28,520
Yeah.

2014
02:00:28,820 --> 02:00:33,620
But iTunes, if you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area.

2015
02:00:33,620 --> 02:00:34,260
Yeah, we'll be back.

2016
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:39,460
But until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZXClark, I'm Daryl Rundis, I'm the Juiciest Dice

2017
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:39,940
Cube.

2018
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:42,500
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

2019
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:47,700
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work.

2020
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:56,980
I love you.
