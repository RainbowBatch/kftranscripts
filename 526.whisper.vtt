00:00.000 --> 00:12.880
N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.880 --> 00:19.520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.320 --> 00:25.120
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.280
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.280
Knowledge Fight.

00:30.280 --> 00:35.120
Dan and Jordan, Knowledge Fight.

00:35.120 --> 00:39.480
I need money.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.380
Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas, Andy and...

00:42.380 --> 00:45.960
Stop it, Andy and, Andy and Kansas.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.340
It's time to pray.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.920
Andy and Kansas you're on the air, thanks for holding.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.680
Hello Alex, I'm a 50-cent color, I'm a huge fan.

00:51.680 --> 00:52.560
I love your room.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.000
Knowledgefight.com.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Knowledgefight.com

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I love you

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Hey everybody

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan. I'm Jordan

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
and talk a little bit about Alex

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Ooooh

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
This is what happens when we record in the morning

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Alex Jones talk

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Hey Dan!

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Dan, I have a quick question for you. What's up?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
What's your bright spot this morning?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Well, this morning my bright spot, Jordan, is

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
we're recording this

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
and it's delayed and I appreciate everybody's

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
understanding. The weather in Chicago was

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
such that recording last night would have been

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
a disaster

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
unnecessary

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
risk in terms of

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
transportation

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
and my bright spot, I guess, is

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
that because of that

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
little scheduling

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
mix-up, shake-up, I was able to

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
watch a little bit of the Royal Rumble last night

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Oh, okay

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I love a Royal Rumble

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Royal Rumble's the one where thirty people

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
run in every five minutes

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I think it's every two or three minutes

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
but the time is fake

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
It's all fake

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Who is the person this time who ran in

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
and within less than five seconds is gone?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I don't know if it was less than five seconds

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
but the sort of joke

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
elimination person was

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
The Hurricane

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
is a character who's a superhero

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Wait, a guy named The Hurricane

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
was tossed out quickly?

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Carter

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
There's a guy named Hurricane

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
and he's a sort of

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
goof character who is a superhero

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
and he got

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
eliminated pretty fast

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
That'll happen

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I love a Royal Rumble

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I do enjoy the pace of it

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I like the idea of

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
people just keep coming

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Theme songs kick in

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
which is one of my favorite things

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
There's exciting returns

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
and you know

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
there's a lot of potential for good storytelling

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
in that structure

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
and yeah

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I enjoyed it

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
A lot of people are probably asking if I have

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
thoughts about it

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I don't have thoughts about it

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
It just was

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Hurricane was my favorite character

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
For sure

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
It was fun though

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
It was nice. How about you?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
My Bright Spot Dan is a movie

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
called PG colon

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Psycho Gorman

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
and it is

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
You guys listening cannot tell

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
that Jordan just leaned in very hard

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Serious

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
It's one of those movies

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
that was made by just

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
somebody for

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
50 bucks or whatever

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
It is a live action cartoon

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
that is very occasionally

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
incredibly funny

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
in a dry deadpan

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
way and also incredibly terrible

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
but it's one of those movies that I'm not

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
going to recommend anybody watch

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
but I'm so happy it exists

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
What year are we talking about?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Immediately

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
This is recent?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
It's just wild and out there

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
It's one of those things where you're just

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
happy that something like that is real

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
If it didn't exist

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I've thought about willing something like

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
that into existence before

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Do you think that this has a possibility

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
of becoming a cult classic?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I do not

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Aggressive head shaking

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
It's not good and people aren't going to watch it

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
or enjoy it but it's there

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Wow high praise

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
It's important to be there

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
It's important for it to exist

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I don't know how to describe something more

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
aptly than that

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I feel like I understand exactly what you're talking about

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
and I have no idea what this thing is

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Yeah exactly

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
We're going to be talking about the time span

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
between January 28th and

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
31st 2021 Blackjack

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah dammit I was actually

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
my plan on the way here

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
when he starts I'm going to go

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Blehhhh

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
And then when you're done I'll go

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Backfired

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Failed miserably

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
We're not actually going to be talking about

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
the 29th on Friday because that was a

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
travel day for Alex coming back from Utah

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
vacation

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I'm not going to be talking about the 30th

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
because that was Saturday

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
although I do have a little bit of something to say

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Alex did a special

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
report with

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Stuart Rhodes of the Oathkeepers

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
in studio

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
where they did running commentary

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
over a documentary

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
about the lockdown

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
or something

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I was watching it and I was thinking

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
maybe we'll cover this but it's

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
just the two of them having kind of a casual

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
conversation about secession

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
and it's not really

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Beyond

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
just saying that they did that and that

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Stuart Rhodes is standing by

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
the Oathkeepers who got arrested

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Of course

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
That's all they really need to know

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I imagine he wakes up every morning and he's like

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Hey they didn't get me yet

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
That's it. That's his life now

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Oh the other thing that was worth

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
pointing out is that Stuart Rhodes

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
was saying that what you should do

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
is throw a big rave

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
and then when the police come to shut it down

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
shoot at them

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Basically it was his

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
They're encroaching

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
on your right to live freely

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
and then you know

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
start it off

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
So here's what we do

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
We set a trap for the law

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
That's basically his version of

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
civil disobedience

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Do something that will

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
attract the police and when they try to arrest you

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
start fighting

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Okay so here's what we do

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
We hold a big rave but before that

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
we dig some trenches right

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
outside the rave and then put some

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
wooden spikes in there

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
and then cover it with leaves and when the cops come

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
they'll all fall and impale themselves

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
It's a pretty good plan Now Stuart I like your plan

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Have you considered quicksand?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Instead of

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
spikes I find that quicksand works better

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
destroys the evidence

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Derek actually came up with

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
moat and but

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
it's just too much I love moats

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Now have you considered this

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I know a guy

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
who likes to hoist safes

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Get a pulley system going

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Have a safe hanging way up in the air

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I'm liking it I'm liking it Sometimes people use

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
pianos Sometimes people use pianos

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I love pianos That is a possibility as well

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
When the cops come

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
drop the piano or safe

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Also we need to have

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
two people walking by holding a very

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
pain of glass

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I do like the idea

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
that it just turns into

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Looney Tunes There's a watermelon

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
cart The whole thing

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Someone walks through with a bunch of pies

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
It's not a good

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
special report by any means

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
It's not interesting and it's very

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
long and we'll not be covering

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
it So Jordan

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
this episode we'll get down to business on it

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
So first let's take a little moment to say thank you

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000

08:24.040 --> 08:26.560
Thank You Zach and also

08:27.200 --> 08:32.880
Someone who donated on an elevated level actually bequeathed their their shout-out

08:33.320 --> 08:36.840
In a way that I think is really cool, so I'm still gonna give them a shout-out Tom

08:37.080 --> 08:43.280
You're you're a technocrat Tom, but Tom wanted to give a shout-out to Chicago bond org

08:43.280 --> 08:49.000
Which is the Chicago community bail fund and I know that we've brought up. You know like if

08:49.000 --> 08:52.200
You know donate to a local charity bail fund in your area

08:52.880 --> 08:57.600
But you know that's a specific one here in the city of Chicago, and yeah, I don't know that one

08:57.600 --> 09:03.280
Then it's something that you know pointing pointing out a specific may be helpful in terms of like you know

09:03.640 --> 09:09.560
Recognizing people in your area there is an analogous version of this so please

09:10.080 --> 09:14.160
If you feel so inclined check out the local bail fund in your area

09:14.160 --> 09:20.040
Please do and I guess Chicago bail fund you're a technocrat ah sure I'm a policy wonk crikey mate

11:30.720 --> 11:32.720
Happy birthday put a downer

11:33.040 --> 11:35.100
Here's an out-of-context drop from today's show

11:35.480 --> 11:40.020
Burn in hell Frederick Nietzsche and Joe Biden and the rest of you Satanist Wow

11:40.600 --> 11:45.560
Quite a quite a Nietzsche and Biden mm-hmm quite a group. That's a that's a list of

11:46.240 --> 11:48.240
the two luminaries of

11:48.280 --> 11:53.120
Philosophical thought I think when I think of Nietzsche I think of Biden when I think of Biden

11:53.120 --> 11:59.880
I think of Nietzsche of course. Yeah, what is Biden, but the ubermensch indeed yeah, so here we start on the 28th

12:00.400 --> 12:01.960
Alex has

12:01.960 --> 12:07.000
Kind of figured out that at this point that oh boy some oath keepers got arrested

12:07.000 --> 12:11.040
Yeah, because they stormed the Capitol yeah, I gotta figure out how this boys not

12:11.640 --> 12:13.000
boogaloo

12:13.000 --> 12:16.280
Straight up both keepers and and with a lot of these other groups

12:16.280 --> 12:20.900
He's sort of been able to figure out how to thread the needle with Q anon. It's like okay

12:20.900 --> 12:26.300
Yeah, it was all a setup mm-hmm with the the proud boys ah Enrique Tarrio

12:26.660 --> 12:33.340
He is a fed totally totally absolutely easy stuff. Yeah with Antifa obviously. I hate them already

12:35.380 --> 12:36.820
Yeah

12:36.820 --> 12:39.820
Both keepers are a little bit more difficult because Alex is

12:40.340 --> 12:44.280
Long time friends with Stuart Rhodes, but he's been a huge promoter of them

12:44.280 --> 12:48.640
And so he kind of has got to be like hey somebody infiltrated

12:48.640 --> 12:49.800
them

12:49.800 --> 12:52.000
The old keepers have had three of their group

12:52.920 --> 12:54.200
indicted

12:54.200 --> 13:00.200
For going in to the Capitol and of course they have informants of people claiming that they were training

13:01.360 --> 13:05.920
Months before there's some type of capital incursion who knows if any of that's true

13:06.400 --> 13:13.680
But the point is is that they are sending infiltrators into every major organization. Yeah, who knows could be anybody yeah

13:13.680 --> 13:19.400
Yeah, right. We're always we're always infiltrating wrong somebody strong take now now

13:19.400 --> 13:26.560
So I was I was kind of confused when I launched into this episode because the day before this Alex had interviewed the

13:27.000 --> 13:29.360
Boogaloo boy Mike Dunn mm-hmm

13:30.040 --> 13:35.040
As I was listening back as I doing the episode. I realized that we missed a real

13:35.840 --> 13:38.500
Great opportunity for a Mike Dunn Mike down

13:38.500 --> 13:40.500
Oh

13:41.540 --> 13:46.740
Did we miss a great opportunity or did we just miss a an okay opportunity yeah

13:46.740 --> 13:50.660
I might have just been okay, but it was there on the table and we missed it

13:51.300 --> 13:56.940
Alex had been humiliated and brow beaten by this guy. I was like okay

13:56.940 --> 14:03.420
I know that he's gonna interview another Boogaloo dude on this 28th January 28th episode

14:03.660 --> 14:04.780
It's like okay

14:04.780 --> 14:10.200
Let's get to it, and he does not get to it instead this kind of seems to be where his head's at

14:10.660 --> 14:14.020
And for me, let me just lay out what I think's biggest and first and foremost

14:15.340 --> 14:20.100
Trump if he gets off the defense could be the president of the world as Chris ready

14:20.660 --> 14:24.540
Said in a very important interview. That's gone viral last night. We should grab that

14:25.460 --> 14:30.180
Chris ruddy interview it's on Newsmax. It's got about a million views as of this morning when I watch it 5 a.m.

14:30.180 --> 14:35.260
And he says Trump can now be president of the world. That's actually a true statement

14:40.260 --> 14:43.220
What the fuck are you talking all right, okay?

14:43.220 --> 14:47.580
So if I understand correctly Trump can become president of the world

14:48.740 --> 14:50.140
power and

14:50.140 --> 14:53.260
Popularity yeah, so Xi Jinping is just gonna be like hey, man

14:53.260 --> 14:57.820
I got you're just got to be the president of the world you got it. Yeah, yeah, absolutely

14:57.820 --> 15:01.800
Absolutely, they're all gonna jump on board listen. I get it listen. I'm

15:02.900 --> 15:07.360
Aggressively against your policies, and I think you're a toxic influence, but

15:08.700 --> 15:13.340
Is he the president of Burma now is that how this goes Myanmar I know

15:14.420 --> 15:17.140
Whenever it's taken over by a Junta

15:18.700 --> 15:26.020
You make an interesting point yeah um I would say that first of all president of the world doesn't exist fair president of the

15:26.020 --> 15:28.860
World being a position implies world government

15:28.860 --> 15:34.580
I would say that would be him being a globalist if if anyone could be a globalist it would be president of the world

15:34.580 --> 15:38.540
I don't want like Obama to be the president of the world

15:38.540 --> 15:40.840
I don't want Hillary to be the president absolutely not

15:40.840 --> 15:43.920
But I do remember a lot of time spent on

15:44.180 --> 15:51.720
Infowars where Alex was talking about how Hillary was gonna be the president sure and then bill was going to become the secretary general

15:51.720 --> 15:57.720
Of the UN yeah, and then they would be together the president of the world you got this was evil

15:57.720 --> 16:04.320
Yeah, now Alex is I guess excited about Trump being the president of the world which sure again doesn't exist no

16:04.840 --> 16:11.240
Whoa oh boy very dumb, which is is he going to get the whole world on board?

16:11.240 --> 16:16.280
Or like what is he gonna do with the holdouts? I guess conquer them. Yeah, he would have to

16:16.280 --> 16:21.120
I mean, it's yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff that goes unspoken

16:22.200 --> 16:25.360
There's one thing I know about Eritrea. They're not backing down

16:27.680 --> 16:29.680
Switzerland gonna try to stay neutral

16:30.680 --> 16:32.200
so

16:32.200 --> 16:39.920
High minded concerns Trump in the possibility of being the president of the world sure certainly very serious mm-hmm

16:40.560 --> 16:42.560
Also, Alex is a little bit petty

16:42.560 --> 16:49.280
Mmm. I'm told by sources close to Biden that he has to read a teleprompter speech up to five times before he can give one

16:49.280 --> 16:51.520
That's half-decent like he gave that very short

16:52.480 --> 16:58.080
Shortest really ever inaugural speech I've heard of I mean Trump's over an hour long Biden's was less than ten minutes

16:58.160 --> 17:02.080
Yeah, and that's because he had to rehearse that at least five times when he's not rehearsed folks

17:02.080 --> 17:08.040
He doesn't know what planet he is on is it possible that Trump's was too long. Why is

17:08.040 --> 17:15.400
His preparation the worst thing a human can do in our world yeah that that is so bizarre like yeah

17:15.400 --> 17:17.400
Oh, he took it seriously

17:18.080 --> 17:21.720
You know what I'm gonna. Go. I'm gonna go crazy on Alex. Let me tell you this

17:21.720 --> 17:24.920
I've got maybe 45 minutes of material

17:24.920 --> 17:31.280
It took me 10 years to write that and I practiced it way more than five times. Yeah, one of the things about performance

17:32.360 --> 17:35.760
Is oftentimes you prepare to?

17:35.760 --> 17:36.880
to

17:36.880 --> 17:43.480
Appear unprepared yes or to prepare like you you want to feel natural. Yeah, I don't understand

17:44.080 --> 17:51.080
You have to say something a million times to make it sound like you're saying it the first time there's a very big difference between

17:51.840 --> 17:53.840
somebody who is

17:54.160 --> 17:58.920
Desperately unprepared and off the cuff and somebody who is able to

18:00.000 --> 18:04.680
Do things off the cuff yeah, I I don't I don't like

18:04.680 --> 18:11.400
This particular instance too is very bizarre to me because it's the inauguration speech. Yeah, that's

18:12.320 --> 18:14.920
Probably one of the most important

18:15.520 --> 18:17.520
biggest sort of

18:17.680 --> 18:19.680
highest respect

18:20.600 --> 18:25.540
Speeches it's kind of a big deal that you're going to give especially in the early times of your presidency

18:25.540 --> 18:29.420
You're gonna set the course maybe give a thesis for like what you want

18:30.040 --> 18:32.040
To achieve in your time in office

18:32.040 --> 18:37.520
I set the tone. I don't want somebody just being like ah fuck it. I'm gonna

18:38.680 --> 18:39.680
I

18:39.680 --> 18:43.480
Think that what Alex is saying is a bad thing about Biden is a actually a really good

18:43.480 --> 18:50.320
I would argue that someone who gives a 10-minute speech over someone who gives an hour speech is always better and

18:51.360 --> 18:56.720
Maybe the preparation allowed him to parse it down to 10 minutes. Maybe trim the fat

18:57.800 --> 19:00.120
Editing is about getting rid of stuff. Yeah

19:00.120 --> 19:01.680
so

19:01.680 --> 19:08.600
Now that Alex knows that the Oath Keepers were there and arrested and that's gonna be infiltrators

19:09.240 --> 19:10.520
maybe

19:10.520 --> 19:17.040
I'll see how Stewart Alex has got a kind of adjust the narrative a little bit and what I think is really funny about this

19:17.040 --> 19:20.120
Is that Alex has to keep changing the narrative?

19:20.720 --> 19:27.400
Whenever new groups of right-wing people are proven to have been there and arrested. There's an issue there

19:27.400 --> 19:34.040
So here's the newest version if we just don't let them use this capital event that they clearly infiltrated Patriot groups

19:34.040 --> 19:36.040
They used Antifa to lead the chance

19:36.280 --> 19:40.640
They got two or three people from each large Patriot group Boogaloo's

19:42.200 --> 19:46.800
Quasi-patriot Oh and Troy are people there but I think overall it's being controlled

19:47.280 --> 19:50.840
The the the Oath Keepers who've been a great organization. They really do remember

19:50.840 --> 19:58.000
Still being set up. I've done a great job right here led by Stuart Rhodes. And then of course, you've got the proud boys that

19:59.600 --> 20:04.120
Good people overall, but it's perfect to be set up at infiltrated and I've reviewed all the footage

20:04.360 --> 20:07.240
There were Boogaloo's there were proud boys and there were

20:08.560 --> 20:11.840
Three Oath Keepers out of the organization tens of thousands

20:11.840 --> 20:17.520
It's true though that that that did lead the break into the capital and I've spent hours again last night this morning

20:17.520 --> 20:20.360
And now that it's all codified now that it's all come out

20:20.360 --> 20:23.560
I actually got tears in my eyes this morning having to watch a Wall Street Journal report

20:23.760 --> 20:27.040
That shows the three proud boys being instrumental breaking into the capital

20:27.720 --> 20:29.920
And they can say oh we showed them and all this stuff

20:30.760 --> 20:34.580
They're not all fed. Some of them are just useful idiots. They got caught up in the mob psychology

20:34.580 --> 20:36.860
But we're not gonna be like the media and lie

20:37.720 --> 20:41.560
You know about things and just you know, say it was all provocateur. It was all staged

20:41.560 --> 20:48.320
If some of it was people being foolish, so what he's trying to imply and he does on this episode

20:48.320 --> 20:50.800
Is that like the people who are leading the charge?

20:51.560 --> 20:56.920
There's a couple people from each group that they had got set up right to

20:57.240 --> 21:03.000
Make everyone in those groups look guilty, correct? This is complicated. So

21:03.000 --> 21:11.120
Every single right-wing group was infiltrated. Uh-huh, and then led to the capital to

21:11.960 --> 21:15.840
Overthrow the government right now. Let me ask you this question Dan

21:15.840 --> 21:21.740
Yeah, why was it so easy to lead them to the capital? Hmm? Is it maybe because they wanted to do it?

21:21.740 --> 21:26.560
I mean, obviously, yes, it's not entrapment even if Alex is

21:26.560 --> 21:33.040
A complete nonsensical conspiracy is true. Yeah, but also none of that is true. It just

21:33.600 --> 21:38.120
Did it know you you guys tried and you failed that's it

21:38.600 --> 21:43.280
You tried to overthrow a country, but you're not a unita. So you failed

21:43.680 --> 21:50.140
The end yeah, and also I don't feel like Joe Biggs would like this kind of tone from Alex

21:50.140 --> 21:56.540
Mm-hmm, because it implies that at best he's a useful idiot. Yeah. Yeah, he's calling everybody

21:56.540 --> 22:02.940
What it this is almost like the revenge of stevie peas like now you're all useful idiots

22:02.940 --> 22:06.300
I'm still the smart one. Damn it. I'm still standing. Yeah

22:07.140 --> 22:09.140
Joe Biggs has got a like I

22:09.820 --> 22:17.040
I got to imagine he's gonna have some complicated therapy in prison about his relationship with Alex

22:17.040 --> 22:22.400
Mm-hmm, because he gets fired from it for wars because of Pizzagate star or he leaves

22:22.400 --> 22:29.040
He tries to start his own news operation Alex kind of is associated with but it's like I don't know keep it an arm's distance

22:29.080 --> 22:33.800
Yeah, the proud boys show up. He decides I'm jumping in both feet

22:33.800 --> 22:37.960
Why not he rises through the ranks of the proud boys becomes like

22:38.400 --> 22:45.820
Really high up in the proud boys makes a name for himself in the in the aggressive dangerous right-wing community

22:45.820 --> 22:52.640
And then storms the capital and goes to prison. Wow. It's so crazy that when it becomes convenient, they just cut loose

22:52.640 --> 22:57.620
Yeah, isn't it? So weird. They don't have that loyalty or anything like that

22:57.960 --> 23:04.940
Who would have guessed man who could have seen that coming? We've seen it happen with all of these groups as Alex

23:04.940 --> 23:14.460
So someone who is loyal to a fault someone who is just just

23:15.440 --> 23:22.940
You know true true as the day is long. I don't know why not Roger Stone is back. Okay, and

23:23.660 --> 23:28.860
He kind of wants to imply that everybody who's into history is a secret leftist

23:28.860 --> 23:35.540
Okay, they want to erase this record in one word impeachment Nixon impeachment Trump

23:35.980 --> 23:43.380
Impeachment it's not right and it's not fair and we know that history is written by the left the historians are

23:43.580 --> 23:48.900
leftists some of some authors like Rick Perlstein pose as

23:49.900 --> 23:51.900
Historians they're not historians. They're

23:51.900 --> 23:59.900
Propagandists, we can't let this happen. You see I think this last final battle for the president is crucial for his legacy

24:00.100 --> 24:03.620
There is this battle of a historical

24:05.060 --> 24:09.820
Pushing yeah that you see that is that is a really it's an interesting thing

24:09.820 --> 24:14.720
That seems to be at least subtly behind a lot of these these right-wing figures

24:15.420 --> 24:20.340
That I find this very interesting the way like sort of Alex believes in lore

24:20.340 --> 24:25.940
As being real. Yeah, and just completely false versions of history

24:26.460 --> 24:33.180
Roger is attacking historians as the left. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the problem is history

24:33.820 --> 24:35.660
Is left-leaning?

24:35.660 --> 24:42.660
The more you read about history the more you're like, oh those fascists are bad and the more you see the fascists

24:42.660 --> 24:47.060
You're like, oh in the modern times the people who are doing the fascism are

24:47.060 --> 24:53.740
Roger Stone and his ilk so it kind of does seem like it's in their interest to portray all of history as

24:54.540 --> 24:58.340
evil, yeah, I mean history is unkind to those who want to cling to

25:00.140 --> 25:06.140
Biases and bigotries of the past totally and I mean pretty clear anyway

25:06.660 --> 25:14.060
Alex is wants to talk to Roger about the impeachment trial. Yeah, the impeachment trial is foremost in his mind and

25:14.060 --> 25:18.380
He really wants this fucking thing to be a circus. Mm-hmm

25:18.380 --> 25:23.740
He really wants Trump to go I don't want it to be you're out of order. I want it to be a circus, too

25:23.740 --> 25:30.540
I don't I I wonder what would be the most sort of politically useful thing

25:30.740 --> 25:33.940
For the sort of policies that we would like sure sure

25:33.940 --> 25:40.860
Would it be more effective for it just to be sort of quiet and go through like the process or would it be effective?

25:40.860 --> 25:46.960
I think if it's a circus, it's probably more effective in splintering the the GOP. Yeah

25:46.960 --> 25:49.400
Yeah, I think that it would lead to

25:50.300 --> 25:51.820
such a

25:51.820 --> 25:57.080
Embarrassing showcase that you know people in the Senate would have much more

25:57.900 --> 25:59.540
baggage

25:59.540 --> 26:02.960
For not voting to convict. Oh, yeah, absolutely

26:03.060 --> 26:07.340
And I think that maybe that would be politically useful, but I'm not positive

26:07.340 --> 26:12.500
It would also be a pretty embarrassing thing just to watch. I mean for the concept of justice

26:13.220 --> 26:17.900
which if you don't have a kind of shared element of

26:18.620 --> 26:22.020
Justice a society can't function. Mm-hmm

26:22.020 --> 26:27.100
So the idea of holding like a two-day little like hey Trump, you're evil

26:27.860 --> 26:34.100
5545 you're acquitted is so offensive to the concept of justice that it's like why?

26:34.100 --> 26:38.220
Why believe that any punishment will ever come to these evil fries?

26:38.220 --> 26:43.900
I'm I'm I'm not even trying to predict or talk about like conviction or acquittal

26:43.900 --> 26:50.420
I'm talking about the strategy of Trump. No totally there. That's what I'm saying about a two-day trial or something like that

26:50.420 --> 26:52.880
that's so offensive to me of like we have

26:54.980 --> 26:56.980
Evidence that is

26:56.980 --> 27:04.460
Controvertible, I guess I guess what you're saying makes sense like a two-day trial with an acquittal or whatever is kind of

27:04.860 --> 27:10.700
Yeah, it's whereas a week two-week trial where Trump is going crazy

27:10.820 --> 27:17.140
Yeah screaming nonsense conspiracy theories and then an acquittal could be toxic to the people who voted for acquittal

27:17.140 --> 27:24.740
Here's the biggest reason. Here's the biggest reason. I don't know how long Trump can be quiet for his lawyers true

27:24.740 --> 27:31.420
So the shorter lawyers wow, he's got two and Barnes is coming baby. I think they all quit

27:31.620 --> 27:38.580
Well, I think the five quit and now he got to like yesterday or something like that, but probably great lawyer. Yeah

27:38.580 --> 27:39.860
Yeah, oh, yeah

27:39.860 --> 27:45.500
God was who but like the longer it goes on the more likely Trump is to be like

27:45.500 --> 27:53.020
I've got something to say and once we get there then the fireworks start happening left and right it is gonna be Barnes, isn't it?

27:53.020 --> 27:59.700
It's totally gonna be Barnes. I feel it in my bones. Yeah, I can't wait to say good job Barnes or good work

28:07.260 --> 28:14.420
It's gonna be so good and I think Trump needs to go in there swinging and saying I'm the guy that's pro law and order

28:14.420 --> 28:17.220
I'm the guy that was you know, trying to expose this election fraud

28:17.220 --> 28:22.200
I'm the he can use that as a place to put on the evidence of election fraud as well

28:22.200 --> 28:24.780
They're not gonna be able to tell him to shut up. This would be spectacular

28:24.940 --> 28:29.400
This would be the ultimate reality TV show and according to many scholars

28:29.400 --> 28:34.060
He could get up to two months of the time to put on his evidence properly hell

28:34.060 --> 28:39.620
Yeah, doesn't agree up front to just let a few lawyers represent him if he does that they're gonna hang him out to dry

28:39.620 --> 28:43.460
What do you think? I think that they can tell him to shut up. Yes, they can

28:44.300 --> 28:46.900
Like if someone is being completely uncooperative

28:46.900 --> 28:52.940
I'm just being like out of order. You could try him in absentia. No, haven't you seen a

28:53.500 --> 28:55.780
Like haven't you ever been to a court, you know

28:55.780 --> 28:58.340
One of those quick traffic courts where they go all day

28:58.440 --> 29:04.400
You're allowed to just scream for as long as you want up to two months and they can't do anything to this thing

29:04.400 --> 29:06.640
It's contempt of course. Nope, not at all

29:07.500 --> 29:14.680
Especially not in the Senate. It's a crucial loophole that we refuse to close never but if you just misbehave in court

29:14.680 --> 29:17.320
Yep, you get off you wait him out. Yeah

29:17.840 --> 29:22.080
Yeah, some people say tubal cane. Some people just wait him out. Yeah, some people go

29:26.640 --> 29:28.120
Yeah, I

29:28.120 --> 29:30.120
Don't think this is a good idea

29:30.120 --> 29:37.160
I do. I think this is dumb in terms of the goals that Alex has I think it's in the real world

29:37.160 --> 29:43.100
It would probably be unproductive and I think that there's another idea that's going around that also would be

29:43.100 --> 29:49.580
Unproductive to the goals that Alex has although because I'm against those goals. I think that maybe they should do it

29:49.580 --> 29:54.220
Yeah, I'm not entirely sure. I'm egging you on I have bad. I haven't fully

29:54.780 --> 29:56.860
thought about or considered the

29:57.660 --> 30:03.540
Logistics or the possibilities of this idea of the Patriot Party right a Trump party splitting

30:04.500 --> 30:10.580
But just from sort of a basic view. I think what you would end up doing is completely

30:10.580 --> 30:18.700
Fracturing the right-wing vote. Yeah, the conservative vote would not be unified and Democrats would probably run

30:18.700 --> 30:22.740
Roughshod have a great almost every election. They might even get DC into statehood

30:23.460 --> 30:30.100
It seems like that would be a really bad decision in terms of the right

30:30.100 --> 30:39.600
Electorally if they had a two-month trial for Trump to present his evidence, uh-huh. They would have to talk real slow. I

30:41.500 --> 30:43.500
Think Rudy could handle it

30:44.460 --> 30:45.820
But the

30:45.820 --> 30:52.660
Roger is against this idea of the the Patriot Party, which I think is probably good political instincts on his part

30:52.660 --> 30:59.100
I think I think that there's a lot of dangers in terms of like were that party to get rolling and have

30:59.100 --> 31:01.100
any kind of

31:01.380 --> 31:05.780
Actual foothold in power. Yeah, I think you could end up with a pretty

31:06.900 --> 31:13.020
Terrifying Overton window kind of situation, but in terms of fracturing electoral power on the right

31:13.020 --> 31:18.680
I think that there's I think it would be dangerous for them. Yeah, and and Roger realizes that

31:19.380 --> 31:23.100
Soros and the globalists don't fund third parties because they don't work

31:23.340 --> 31:27.420
They might be a one-issue, you know deal to stop fracking or this or that

31:27.420 --> 31:32.020
So they'll fund it just to give it legitimacy to shut off our energy supplies like the Green Party

31:32.020 --> 31:35.700
But when you pull back from this, it's taking over parties you want to do

31:35.700 --> 31:40.220
It's Soros and the globalists have taken over the Democrats that the communist Chinese are taking them over

31:40.340 --> 31:43.820
They're putting in their DA's they're putting in their attorney generals. It's a nightmare

31:44.100 --> 31:49.380
We need as American people to control at least one party. We almost got there with Trump. I agree

31:49.380 --> 31:53.940
That's why they fear him so much. He wanted a landslide. They're absolutely right. We do not need this third party

31:53.940 --> 31:59.360
That is a nuclear option down the road, you know just for him to run for president or something if he had to

31:59.580 --> 32:05.260
But he's not gonna be barred from that. He's gonna defeat this trial in the Senate and I really think that

32:05.700 --> 32:09.660
He should run for governor or senator or maybe he should run against Rubio

32:09.660 --> 32:14.740
I mean, I really think we need to get President Trump back in back in DC

32:14.740 --> 32:16.660
That is what we need to be the real leader

32:16.660 --> 32:23.100
I don't fucking understand why you think he has any interest in running against Marco Rubio

32:23.100 --> 32:29.420
I mean maybe for the the campaign he'd have fun with that. Sure. She doesn't want to be in the fucking Senate. Good. God. No

32:30.700 --> 32:35.940
Imagine imagine. Oh god, that'd be terrible. Yeah, what a nightmare that be

32:35.940 --> 32:42.160
He doesn't want to do like that would be so much work. Mm-hmm. It's not all about Trump. No, no

32:42.540 --> 32:48.900
You have to cooperate. There's a there's a minority whip who tells you what to do

32:48.900 --> 32:54.140
Yeah, you're on the phone all the time trying to get donations and shit. Imagine that. Yeah. Oh

32:54.820 --> 32:57.380
Can you imagine what kind of bills he would write?

32:58.860 --> 33:00.860
Cran yeah

33:00.980 --> 33:02.980
brutal absolutely brutal

33:03.700 --> 33:05.540
bill to

33:05.540 --> 33:12.980
Provide senators in Florida with free fast food. No, and it's so right. It's so right to be like no

33:12.980 --> 33:17.580
No, we need to maintain the two-party system because as long as both parties are awful

33:17.580 --> 33:22.500
they can keep passing the ball back and forth, you know, so that means that they can still be owned by

33:23.460 --> 33:29.140
Billionaires if any party governed effectively the other party would be destroyed, you know

33:29.140 --> 33:31.580
Like the Democrats already are like, whoa

33:31.580 --> 33:36.140
Well, I know we promised 2000 but let's do 1400 and you're like guys

33:36.860 --> 33:44.140
Really? Are we doing this? Mm-hmm. Okay, we'll see the Republicans in two years. Thanks, buddy. Good work. Good work you morons

33:44.540 --> 33:45.700
Yeah

33:45.700 --> 33:52.140
Stupid it's a bummer. Yep, but Trump will not be a senator. Absolutely not. Why would he run against DeSantis?

33:54.100 --> 34:01.140
If he runs for governor, there's no way the state remains in the Union the end if Trump is the governor of Florida

34:01.140 --> 34:07.340
He is the president of the United Florida moving Mar-a-Lago to Texas. Yeah, exactly there. We will take our stand

34:07.980 --> 34:13.120
I'm moving to the Alamo, Texas. Yeah, that's not the Alamo shit too close to the border

34:13.120 --> 34:15.120
so Roger is

34:16.560 --> 34:21.300
Weird because he doesn't want a third party like this Patriot Party is a bad idea

34:21.300 --> 34:27.880
But at the same time don't give any fucking money to the RNC. No, fuck them evil. Trump should be president of the world

34:28.640 --> 34:36.100
Look, I would not donate a penny to the Republican National Committee and I would urge those out there in the info Wars audience to

34:36.100 --> 34:43.400
Follow in suit there. There is no chance that money is being spent effectively. Mm-hmm. Okay

34:43.960 --> 34:45.960
amazing points, but please go back to

34:46.480 --> 34:49.680
What ruddy said about Trump could be really the president of the world?

34:50.240 --> 34:57.360
For nationalism for patriotism for populism for better trade deals. How would you be the president of the world for nationalism?

34:57.360 --> 35:01.200
Very weird very very weird

35:02.360 --> 35:07.640
As president of the world, no one can move. I think it's probably a politically

35:09.080 --> 35:11.080
I don't know

35:11.080 --> 35:12.240
counterproductive

35:12.240 --> 35:16.360
To say hey, we shouldn't have a third party. We got to take over the Republican Party

35:16.360 --> 35:22.160
But also don't give the Republican Party any money. No. No, let's make sure we don't support them

35:22.160 --> 35:27.880
But also we had to take them over. Yeah, we all got to give money to the right scam. Not the wrong way man

35:28.040 --> 35:30.040
Exactly. Yeah, so

35:30.200 --> 35:36.400
Alex it gets mad here. He's Roger takes off because he's he's just at his piece and

35:37.360 --> 35:45.040
Alex gets mad about Nancy Pelosi because she is not thrilled with there being members of the house who's murderers

35:45.920 --> 35:48.240
Seem to have hostile intentions

35:48.240 --> 35:50.240
It's murdering attentions

35:51.680 --> 35:53.640
Marjorie Greene

35:53.640 --> 35:59.920
Certainly has said some things that would make me feel unsafe in a work environment. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

36:00.000 --> 36:06.400
She's not Nancy Pelosi is not happy about that and good for her because I don't think she should have to put up with that

36:06.400 --> 36:13.120
Right, right. Then you have the the Lauren Boebert's of the world also not making you feel super safe

36:13.120 --> 36:18.720
And so she in an interview said that the enemy is inside. Yeah

36:20.280 --> 36:25.360
You know Alex is not thrilled about that wrong not thrilled wrong Alex is pretty mad about that

36:26.360 --> 36:32.000
That's a pretty astounding clip of Pelosi saying that the they need more security because of Republican Congress people

36:32.000 --> 36:32.600
Hey lady

36:32.600 --> 36:37.320
It was your supporter went and shot Scalise and tried to kill 18 others you lying sack of garbage

36:37.640 --> 36:42.720
Burning hell Pelosi and by that I mean we're not judgment on you. I think God's sending you to hell

36:42.720 --> 36:43.800
That's what I mean by that

36:43.800 --> 36:49.080
okay, the thing that I think is interesting about that clip is it's one of a number of times Alex has to

36:49.720 --> 36:51.720
over-clarify stuff

36:54.360 --> 36:56.360
All right, so

36:57.520 --> 37:02.840
Everybody is getting caught for doing the thing. I told them to do I better be real safe

37:02.840 --> 37:07.400
I better better be real safe Nancy Pelosi. You're gonna burn it out and by that I mean

37:07.400 --> 37:14.440
I believe that God has it out for you and once you die your soul is gonna have trouble and in this circumstance

37:14.440 --> 37:18.560
I'm gonna point you to Romans 12 16 because nobody gets mad at the Bible

37:18.560 --> 37:21.680
Yeah, so Owen Schroyer has been sitting alongside

37:22.240 --> 37:25.720
He's theoretically hosting the show and Alex is co-hosting

37:25.720 --> 37:33.240
But Alex is just doing the everything sure sure and Owen has some ideas that he wants to introduce to the proceedings about how unpopular

37:33.240 --> 37:38.460
Joe Biden is mm-hmm. He has some primary evidence that I think is stupid

37:39.000 --> 37:42.560
But you know getting back to the Biden issue here Alex. I was looking at this today

37:43.240 --> 37:46.840
And I just have one little printout here. It doesn't really work for the printout, but I was looking at

37:47.980 --> 37:53.340
Google search trends and if the crew wants to do this they can do this I was looking at Google search trends

37:53.840 --> 37:56.320
Biden as a Google search trend was almost

37:57.320 --> 38:02.780
Non-existent in the year 2020 almost non-existent Trump on the Google search trend is like number one

38:02.780 --> 38:07.240
Oh, but Biden had the most votes ever and then the other thing I noticed Alex

38:08.240 --> 38:16.560
two of the top three word associations with Biden on a search trend is this what we're doing pedophilia and

38:17.440 --> 38:18.440
dementia

38:18.440 --> 38:23.840
So the world under why to this guy is and and guys by the way lay that paper back down

38:23.840 --> 38:26.520
I know they consume in more lay it back down where you had it

38:28.200 --> 38:31.440
They should just do this because it doesn't really look good on the printout the

38:31.440 --> 38:34.140
The things I don't care that you but I mean still zoom in on it

38:34.140 --> 38:37.100
No, they can do it. They can zoom in that camera's got like five times more zoom

38:37.280 --> 38:42.240
Just zoom in on that guys because this is huge. Yeah, absolutely. Oh, this is huge huge

38:42.280 --> 38:47.040
Yeah, Google Trends Trump put out an online poll where he

38:47.880 --> 38:53.240
98% of people said they want him to be president. I don't understand how Biden won. Yeah, it's impossible. It's impossible

38:54.560 --> 38:58.520
98% of Americans want Trump to be president. That's the only polls that I listen to this

38:58.520 --> 39:05.000
Yeah, this is this is an instance of taking something that on its on the surface

39:05.640 --> 39:09.520
Appears to be making an argument that Trump is far more popular than Biden

39:09.520 --> 39:15.560
Yeah, but also has no relevance not to the larger issue that they're talking about. Nope. This is very dumb

39:15.560 --> 39:21.640
Yeah, so we got some guests coming up after Roger. Yeah, we got a couple of big big hitters

39:22.120 --> 39:27.840
But I want to let listeners also know Stuart Rhodes founder row keepers will be joining us the last 30 minutes the next hour

39:27.840 --> 39:30.280
We have another one of the boogaloo leaders

39:31.200 --> 39:34.120
Joining us to talk about what really happened at the Capitol

39:34.600 --> 39:37.280
You know, I have to say that the boogaloo guy we had on your state

39:37.280 --> 39:43.160
It's some cheap shot saying, you know that I might be in the CIA or a fed, but I get from his perspective

39:43.160 --> 39:49.480
I'm saying that to him, but only because you can't swing a stick in any of these groups and not hit a Fed

39:49.480 --> 39:54.260
I mean look at the Enrique Tarrio thing coming out. He's been a federal informant for many many years

39:54.260 --> 40:00.400
Is he a bad guy? No, no, I can what but and that just goes with the territory ladies and gentlemen

40:00.400 --> 40:04.420
What it's the same thing with the boogaloo is the same thing with any of this Wow, that's weird

40:04.420 --> 40:07.580
he is if he is a fat informant a

40:08.460 --> 40:12.720
Literal demon servant. Uh-huh. I like that guy. Hey, he's a good guy

40:14.020 --> 40:19.260
Look, I don't I don't know what Tarrio was up to like. I don't know now me

40:19.260 --> 40:24.380
I haven't I still haven't seen concrete evidence that he was informing on the Proud Boys still don't care either

40:24.380 --> 40:30.340
I'm Alex's perspective. He has to think that he was and that's the way that Alex is presenting this

40:30.340 --> 40:33.460
Yeah, it makes no sense to be like, yeah, this guy was a snitch

40:33.500 --> 40:39.220
He was infiltrating groups in order to make them look bad. Maybe even was instrumental in planning false flags

40:39.380 --> 40:41.380
Demon servant good, dude

40:44.580 --> 40:46.580
That makes no sense no also is

40:46.580 --> 40:50.720
Jarring to hear Alex be like look I talked to this boogaloo guy

40:50.720 --> 40:56.380
He said I was a fucking inside dude, like I was false controlled opposition. You know what? Hey, I understand

40:56.380 --> 41:01.780
I'm saying the same thing about him and hey, maybe he's cool. Yeah, you guys are doing great work together

41:01.780 --> 41:05.660
You guys are doing great work together. What man? That's some that's some

41:07.060 --> 41:09.940
Softened really fast. Yeah on this whole thing

41:09.940 --> 41:16.860
Yeah, the boogaloo boys were supposed to be his ticket out of this and now he's like like these guys. Oh

41:16.860 --> 41:18.020
We're all yeah

41:18.020 --> 41:25.000
we're all in trouble and I think one of the issues is sort of distorted views of what unity is possible or is

41:25.260 --> 41:31.220
Pursuable right and Owen Schroyer seems to be really on the unity kick right now

41:31.220 --> 41:33.460
That seems to be his big project

41:33.460 --> 41:40.100
Mm-hmm. He's talking about like reaching out to Black Lives Matter and and like and folks on the left so certain

41:40.100 --> 41:45.060
I saw I heard him screaming fuck BLM. Oh, yeah, and antifa

41:45.060 --> 41:50.500
I'm just positive that there was a flag involved. They burned it. I think they burned a flag

41:50.500 --> 41:56.380
Oh, yeah, and now they're gonna you want to reach out? Okay good and Alex is kind of like yeah

41:57.380 --> 42:01.580
Shit, I'm supposed to be above partisan politics

42:01.580 --> 42:08.140
That was to be my whole thing. What happened? I mean, I want unity. I don't want to fight with the average Democrat

42:08.140 --> 42:12.020
We need a populist movement that is for common sense in this country all team

42:12.020 --> 42:17.440
We're bringing that up because we get so part of described them especially under the last few years with Trump that that's something that actually

42:17.620 --> 42:21.660
Energize the worst elements of the Soros left to kind of take over the populist

42:21.980 --> 42:26.420
Liberals and who are who are on average not bad people and I think could be reached out to what do you think?

42:26.420 --> 42:31.680
I think that the reality of what Alex is talking about is I miss when

42:31.740 --> 42:35.500
Some people on the left were tricked by my opposition to the Iraq war

42:35.500 --> 42:41.440
I miss back when I could yell about George Bush and I could be deemed not an

42:41.820 --> 42:48.900
Incredibly insane extreme right-wing zealot. Yeah, there was a time there where I wasn't in the pocket of somebody whose mood

42:48.900 --> 42:52.300
I was looking I miss having the facade of

42:52.300 --> 42:56.760
Rationality because I was to the right of George W Bush. Yep

42:58.460 --> 43:02.540
Yeah, this is this is silly yeah, I will I will accept it a

43:03.340 --> 43:09.460
unity from these people when I they apologize publicly and make amends for it and

43:10.100 --> 43:16.940
Correct their mistakes. Yeah, then we can be unified again until then go fuck yourselves. So speaking of unity

43:17.500 --> 43:19.100
Owen

43:19.100 --> 43:23.820
Believes that he sees opportunity in the GameStop and Robin Hood

43:24.140 --> 43:31.500
situation in order to bring people into the fold this disillusionment right with the perceived fairness of

43:31.660 --> 43:38.060
the stock market is something that he believes that they can use to bring people into the ranks of the

43:38.620 --> 43:43.660
Info wars universe and and I believe that that is false unity

43:43.660 --> 43:45.280
I believe that's you know

43:45.280 --> 43:51.140
The the kind of thing that you see constantly with anything that galvanizes people particularly online

43:51.400 --> 43:55.940
You'll see an attempt at infiltration of it by the right-wing

43:56.940 --> 44:00.260
Demagogue totally and I can see a bit of Owen

44:00.780 --> 44:04.740
Seeing an opportunity there. Although I don't think

44:05.380 --> 44:11.140
That it's gonna be effective and I also don't think it's gonna be something that's gonna be even discussed on info whores

44:11.140 --> 44:15.140
In within a week. Yeah, I would agree with so I don't care to talk about it too much

44:15.140 --> 44:19.380
because it's not really a big issue and it also is something that I

44:20.500 --> 44:27.580
Just see it as being like this might be a wedge. This might be something we can use and oh and just doesn't have the chops

44:28.180 --> 44:33.980
So we get to the the next book boogaloo boy. Mm-hmm who comes in he's guy named Magnus Panvidya

44:35.100 --> 44:37.100
He's a guy fine. Yeah

44:37.100 --> 44:44.760
he is the boogaloo boy who was recently interviewed on the Jimmy Dore show and it seems to be somebody who's making the

44:44.860 --> 44:51.860
Rounds a bit in terms of like being someone who people will interview sure and I can understand

44:51.860 --> 44:53.860
Why because he doesn't sound crazy

44:54.540 --> 44:55.980
which is

44:55.980 --> 44:57.980
I mean a plus

44:58.220 --> 44:59.740
For a public face

44:59.740 --> 45:05.060
If I was going to be the public face of a group whose main goal was a second Civil War

45:05.060 --> 45:10.300
Mm-hmm. It would be wise to be like, hey, come on. I'm a good dude. I'm smart. I'm

45:11.100 --> 45:16.380
Conversational you guys can I like all sorts of people. Yeah, I seem rational as shit. Yeah, and

45:17.480 --> 45:19.480
He has a different approach

45:19.700 --> 45:26.140
Sort of a good cop bad cop kind of thing with Mike Dunn where Mike Dunn when he was on the day before

45:26.660 --> 45:30.020
Was kind of being a brusque Alex. You're kind of a shitbag. Yeah

45:30.020 --> 45:34.300
Next hey, Alex, we're the ones who are doing the shit that you pretend you do

45:34.300 --> 45:40.660
Yeah, now that Alex has taken that lashing and also now has softened so much

45:40.660 --> 45:46.700
Yeah, now comes the balm the sound sure to make those those wounds feel better

45:47.820 --> 45:53.800
Magnus give us your view on what the boogaloo's really are and what you guys just did and what just unfolded

45:54.940 --> 45:56.940
activate the boogaloo's

45:56.940 --> 46:00.460
Uh-huh. Yeah, we're just kind of a libertarian

46:01.340 --> 46:04.700
Anarchist coalition kind of a militia more of a movement

46:05.500 --> 46:08.060
We started off in the lockdowns

46:08.060 --> 46:13.580
Then we expanded throughout the whole George George Floyd and all the BLM events and look

46:13.580 --> 46:16.460
You just continue to be operating on the ground is kind of a more

46:17.060 --> 46:21.100
Unifying not right or left armed movement. Fuck you

46:21.100 --> 46:28.180
Well, I kind of like that actually I want to get the left involved in liberals deprogramming and into owning guns of self-defense

46:28.520 --> 46:30.280
This isn't the way

46:30.280 --> 46:32.280
no, no, no, I

46:32.740 --> 46:38.160
Think that you already see a contradiction between and what Mike Dunn was saying and what Magnus is saying

46:38.520 --> 46:42.440
He's saying we got started in the lockdown. Yeah, this is this grew out of

46:42.960 --> 46:45.360
Absolutely with jokes about a second Civil War

46:45.360 --> 46:52.360
I am NOT going to be told lies about your own history by a fucking accountant. That's what this dude sounds like

46:52.360 --> 46:54.280
He sounds like a fucking accountant Dan

46:54.280 --> 47:00.060
You're just saying that cuz the release the boogaloo is a real dorky joke to start off

47:01.120 --> 47:02.320
Yeah

47:02.320 --> 47:04.320
So Alex, you know

47:05.040 --> 47:07.040
He's really making

47:07.800 --> 47:15.000
Detente here sure and in a lot of ways he talks about he's talking about how like I had this bad feeling about Mike Dunn

47:15.000 --> 47:16.680
But I was wrong

47:16.680 --> 47:22.280
Well, I had Mike on yesterday and I got to say I thought he was probably a fed or some every law center

47:22.280 --> 47:22.920
I didn't approve of that

47:22.920 --> 47:27.880
I just a lot of these groups get led by those but I I didn't get that sense actually having him on I got the

47:27.880 --> 47:34.320
sense he really believes in what he's doing and maybe I've been I'm not saying boogaloo's are perfect as any big organization can get

47:34.360 --> 47:41.120
Infiltrated but that maybe you maybe you guys overall do have a good goal. My concern is are you guys acceleration is do you want a

47:41.120 --> 47:42.360
revolution I

47:42.360 --> 47:47.640
Mean we we have you not only that a revolution is inevitable. But yes, we want a revolution

47:47.640 --> 47:51.380
It just depends on what form that takes we want it to be the most peaceful

47:52.020 --> 47:57.680
People's revolution is humanly possible, but we're also not ignorant to the idea that the establishment's gonna go after that

47:57.680 --> 48:04.440
They're gonna try to destroy it and they'll probably go on the offensive against us. So I just think that he's steamrolling Alex

48:05.520 --> 48:07.520
Alex is just letting this guy

48:07.520 --> 48:12.200
have a have a very friendly platform to

48:13.000 --> 48:16.800
present this exactly how he wants to and it's it is

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
unacceptable

48:19.000 --> 48:24.040
dissembling to be like we want a peaceful revolution but but no

48:24.400 --> 48:24.880
No

48:24.880 --> 48:31.720
That sentence ends with a period now if you want to continue that thought and say we want a peaceful revolution

48:31.720 --> 48:38.440
Period we believe that there is going to be resistance to that. We will fight that

48:39.080 --> 48:43.120
Peacefully, yeah, then that's cool. Yeah, there's there's two kinds of

48:43.920 --> 48:45.920
approaches that I see being

48:46.800 --> 48:51.280
Possible when you have something like this group that is really interested in

48:51.720 --> 48:58.360
Gun concerns and what have you second amendment stuff? Yeah, you could have somebody who's like, okay

48:58.360 --> 49:05.040
I disagree with open carry restrictions. So we're gonna get people together and we're gonna have an open carry March right, right

49:05.520 --> 49:08.360
There's two things that can do two approaches

49:08.360 --> 49:15.360
you can take one is that we expect we're gonna get arrested and then that arrest we will accept and we will use that to

49:15.360 --> 49:16.840
try and

49:16.840 --> 49:23.760
Change laws right change public opinion by virtue of our arrest seeming unfair to most people

49:23.760 --> 49:28.320
Or you could take the approach of we're gonna do this and we're gonna threaten people with these cut

49:28.320 --> 49:32.320
That would be the way to do it. And if people try and arrest us someone might get shot

49:32.320 --> 49:34.720
Yeah, like I think the first

49:35.320 --> 49:41.840
Might be productive right? The first one is something that even if I disagree with your position on the open carry laws

49:41.840 --> 49:49.000
I don't see a problem with someone doing a demonstration and a protest like that. Yeah when it comes to like

49:49.000 --> 49:55.320
Someone might get shot. That's that's when we're we're in dangerous territory. I mean, you know like

49:56.520 --> 50:00.000
They're they're bullshit about unity and all that stuff

50:00.000 --> 50:05.600
I I think immediately to of Fred Hampton like Fred Hampton

50:05.880 --> 50:12.560
Was a person who went into these Second Amendment groups these fucking militia groups and was like hey

50:12.560 --> 50:18.880
This is a class struggle. This is about us and convinced them and they joined him

50:18.880 --> 50:23.280
Mm-hmm, and then they acted peacefully and that's why Fred Hampton was murdered

50:23.760 --> 50:27.600
Because it was them moving to the left. Mm-hmm. If it's the other way around

50:28.240 --> 50:32.960
Yeah, we're in trouble there. So Magnus believes and expresses that

50:33.520 --> 50:36.520
Hey, the man is trying to get everyone to fight with each other, right?

50:37.560 --> 50:39.260
Sure. Sure

50:39.260 --> 50:42.600
Alex is like, yeah, okay, cool. Cool. Cool. Cool

50:43.280 --> 50:47.620
But antifa they hate the cops, right? What about you guys? Okay

50:47.620 --> 50:50.160
He does not get the answer. He wants I imagine so the

50:50.560 --> 50:55.920
Establishment right now is trying to get everyone to fight and kill each other instead of coming together against them

50:55.920 --> 50:59.840
They want all of these groups. They want antifa. They want three percenters

50:59.840 --> 51:04.200
They want all of these groups to think the other side is the most evil thing in the world and it's you know

51:04.200 --> 51:08.840
Secretly attempting to destroy them so they can laugh all the way to the bank while we fight and kill each other

51:08.840 --> 51:12.040
Huh, and that's what we don't want. Well, there's no doubt that's going on

51:12.040 --> 51:15.560
But I mean by you if it says the local police of the enemy. I mean, do you think that?

51:15.560 --> 51:21.760
At this point. I find it hard to believe that the local police aren't the enemy like when when you look at gun confiscation

51:21.760 --> 51:25.600
A lot of local police are just going along with that and not saying anything when you look at

51:25.960 --> 51:29.400
Lockdowns when you look at arresting people over pot when you look at

51:29.960 --> 51:35.440
Busting protests whether they be right-wing or left-wing protests very aggressively and laughing about it

51:35.440 --> 51:38.960
I've you know, obviously I'm not saying that officer friendly in a small town

51:38.960 --> 51:41.640
That's never done anything wrong is some horrible individual

51:41.640 --> 51:48.320
But when you look at the institution of policing across the entire country, they've forsaken liberty in all directions

51:49.120 --> 51:54.720
See what's interesting here is that Magnus is coming in with a complex thought

51:54.720 --> 51:55.040
Yeah

51:55.040 --> 51:58.320
That Alex can't really deal with well

51:58.320 --> 52:06.040
He started with people are trying to divide the left and right and saying both sides are the most evil people on the planet

52:06.040 --> 52:10.400
So they can never communicate with each other and while they're doing that they're laughing all the way to the bank

52:10.400 --> 52:14.820
Right that reminds you of anyone did one thick-necked individual comes to mind

52:15.520 --> 52:20.520
The exact person that he's talking to has spent all of his time talking about how antifa are

52:21.160 --> 52:27.280
Meth-head demon spawn. Yeah, whatever. Yeah, the leaving that aside like yeah, I

52:27.920 --> 52:30.080
Don't agree and I'm not gonna side with

52:31.240 --> 52:33.240
Magnus but issues with

52:33.880 --> 52:36.340
Policing are issues with police

52:36.340 --> 52:42.300
absolutely, and Alex can try and deny that kind of stuff as much as he wants but you know

52:42.300 --> 52:46.100
Magnus has a has a more interesting perspective on on

52:46.840 --> 52:54.100
The police then Alex I I would counsel very hard to remember this motherfucker is lying

52:54.220 --> 52:58.420
Yeah, he is. He's he's saying he's making well points. He's making good points

52:58.420 --> 53:04.540
Maybe in the service of lies, maybe not lying because I do believe that he does have problems with police sure

53:04.540 --> 53:06.900
It's disingenuous. Yeah, that's more I think

53:07.700 --> 53:14.900
Lying about what his his his intentions. Yeah. Yeah. No, this is this is absolutely a fucking a

53:15.940 --> 53:22.180
Bullshit way of being like see I listen to the problems on the left and we're gonna pay attention to them when they join us

53:22.180 --> 53:24.740
we're gonna team up and solve those problems and

53:25.260 --> 53:28.820
I don't know Dan. Have we seen what happens when?

53:28.820 --> 53:35.380
Let's say right-wing grifters find something no longer useful a toss-it-aside

53:36.340 --> 53:39.640
Yeah, I would suggest that if you were thinking about

53:40.780 --> 53:45.500
Them having good points maybe remember what they do whenever you're no longer useful

53:45.500 --> 53:45.980
Yeah

53:45.980 --> 53:51.520
And I mean not for nothing in the wake of this dude being on Jimmy doors show

53:51.740 --> 53:56.860
Some people did look through his Twitter and found him supporting Kyle Rittenhouse. Sure

53:56.860 --> 54:02.860
It's like I don't know man. No, I don't know. Nah, it's unity. Yeah, we're all about unity

54:02.860 --> 54:04.180
I don't know about this

54:04.180 --> 54:11.720
So for Alex though, the question comes back to pretty constantly as it did with Mike. Who are you targeting?

54:11.720 --> 54:18.780
I want to ask you about in a revolution and what your goals would be of that revolution or that new declaration of independence

54:18.980 --> 54:23.980
And my concern is I never see people protesting big tech or I mean Apple runs

54:23.980 --> 54:27.380
No factories in China, and I'm not saying Apple

54:27.380 --> 54:34.020
I don't want that but but but I mean if Uyghurs bombed Apple, they would have a real argument Apple runs the main slave camps

54:34.020 --> 54:38.780
So if Uyghurs attacked Apple, they would have a legitimate argument at the UN Hague that we're under attack

54:38.780 --> 54:42.380
We were attacking who's attacking us. I'm not saying do that. I'm just saying all the time

54:42.380 --> 54:47.660
I heard the local police that sounds like a communist takeover of local government. I'm not saying you're doing that

54:47.660 --> 54:50.380
That's what I'm concerned about. Stay right there, sir. We'll come right back to you

54:50.380 --> 54:53.980
No time for him to respond to that diatribe. Nope

54:54.700 --> 55:00.340
and again, it just comes down to Alex like his his his two issues seem to be like

55:00.620 --> 55:07.100
This isn't being directed by me and you're not targeting the people that I want you to target. Yeah. Yeah

55:07.100 --> 55:09.100
Yeah, my biggest issue

55:09.540 --> 55:14.140
Is why isn't everybody doing what I say? Yeah, they can be as

55:14.140 --> 55:20.620
Explicitly anti globalist like Mike Dunn was very clearly like I am against these global

55:21.500 --> 55:23.500
global ists

55:23.860 --> 55:27.340
And it doesn't matter because Alex doesn't see them blowing up

55:28.780 --> 55:35.220
My stuff yeah, can you imagine that's what Trump in the Senate would be like, he's like why isn't everybody doing what I want to do

55:35.460 --> 55:41.060
Mm-hmm. That's the whole thing. What's a quorum? I am a narcissist. I can't spell quorum

55:41.060 --> 55:45.380
Yeah, so again announced quorum quokka. Yeah, Alex

55:45.900 --> 55:50.540
You know, he his problem seems to be that like they have a revolution in mind

55:51.300 --> 55:54.780
Revolution is probably good. You should do it. Yeah, but it's not my

55:55.380 --> 56:01.180
Revolution and kind of as a problem. Yeah, and then he makes an insane analogy. We had

56:02.020 --> 56:06.180
Mr. Dunn on yesterday and I really thought about it after the interview. I thought I don't think that guy's a fed

56:06.180 --> 56:10.180
I think he's really pissed off about what's happening in the world and trying to unify everybody

56:10.180 --> 56:11.660
around

56:11.660 --> 56:17.420
One message and if they can successfully do that, that'd be great. I'm just really concerned about

56:18.540 --> 56:24.300
The goals of a revolution and and and who leads it. I mean, it'd be great if we had a bunch of state governors

56:24.940 --> 56:32.700
And respected generals and respected lawyers and the Confederacy you're literally describing the Confederacy formed a new Declaration of Independence

56:33.100 --> 56:38.720
That's 100% the Confederacy over. It's what are we doing over? It's illegitimate the great resets illegal

56:38.720 --> 56:44.680
And so we you know reform our new Union and we have that right. I just see what happened at the Capitol

56:45.160 --> 56:50.440
Which the Boogaloo's bragged about being part of people can try to walk that back whatever it was idiocy

56:50.440 --> 56:55.080
I wouldn't call it an assault. I would call it a a pissing contest. I would call it me like a

56:55.760 --> 56:58.960
Yeah, it was a little bit more intense than kind of that's what you call it

56:59.840 --> 57:03.800
Other than them killing four citizens a cop have an heart attack Wow more intense

57:03.800 --> 57:08.200
Than what you see in movies like Animal House

57:08.200 --> 57:15.080
I mean, you know Animal House pranks are now like terrorism walking off of lecterns one cop got squashed in the door

57:15.080 --> 57:21.080
There was some nasty to some fights. It was wrong, but not a new Pearl Harbor. So so so Magnus see

57:21.400 --> 57:25.680
What you don't understand Jordan your mouth is open as if in surprise

57:25.760 --> 57:30.320
But what you don't understand is that the storming of the Capitol was basically like, you know

57:30.320 --> 57:34.160
How like in an old TV show, you know, like a panty raid sure. It's

57:34.960 --> 57:39.600
Prank, so so what Alex also is quite inappropriate in hindsight

57:39.600 --> 57:45.960
Is that the Patriots jumped the general Lee over the Capitol building? Mm-hmm. That's what we're describing here. Yeah

57:45.960 --> 57:49.120
Yeah, I mean basically it's like teepeeing

57:50.280 --> 57:53.680
Yeah, a lot of cops die when teepeeing. Yeah, basically

57:54.320 --> 57:56.520
The the right-winger is just egged

57:56.520 --> 58:00.800
Hey, what are you gonna do? We were throwing a little prank. Come on

58:01.240 --> 58:06.880
Basically, they waited until the Capitol passed out and then they put the capital's hand in some warm water Wow Wow

58:07.440 --> 58:13.440
Just while they waited until the capital passed out and then they put shaving cream on its hand and then tickled the capital with a

58:13.440 --> 58:17.520
Feather I just don't know what to do when someone would try and say that

58:18.160 --> 58:24.640
Like I just there's what just I want to get a white glove and challenge him to a duel

58:24.640 --> 58:32.840
I don't know what to do about that. Yeah, I would say that if this is just the like slightly above frat pranks

58:33.960 --> 58:37.600
Why are you talking about it so much? Oh, that's a good point

58:38.320 --> 58:40.320
Also, I don't remember

58:40.880 --> 58:44.560
Spending days and days trying to scapegoat a frat prank

58:44.720 --> 58:50.520
Anyway, Alex has seen the interview with Jimmy Dore that this guy did and he loves it

58:50.520 --> 58:56.960
And even before I even went on Jimmy Dore the only podcast I could even get on was a podcast called Liberty Lockdown

58:57.040 --> 59:02.040
Which was a small decentralized podcast that they didn't have the ability to censor. Yeah, let's talk about that

59:02.040 --> 59:04.080
That was a great interview you did with Jimmy Dore

59:05.040 --> 59:11.440
yeah, and I'm so happy for him to have me come on because what has given me the ability to do is to break through all

59:11.440 --> 59:14.200
the mainstream media lies about us because there's

59:14.200 --> 59:22.040
extremist experts and journalists that have covered us all year long and have buck or a heels of video and text evidence showing what

59:22.040 --> 59:28.160
our movements about and it doesn't line up with what the mainstream media has all and they'll they'll directly quote these

59:28.360 --> 59:35.920
Extremist experts that work for DC and quote them on certain parts, but when those same extremist experts say no, we're not white supremacists

59:35.920 --> 59:37.280
Yes, we work with BLM

59:37.280 --> 59:42.880
They'll take those parts of their report and hide it and run us all rough shot across the media and I feel the same

59:42.880 --> 59:46.200
Thing's been done to Antifa. I still feel the same thing's been done to three percenters

59:46.200 --> 59:49.680
I feel like the same thing's been done to BLM. Fuck you. Yeah

59:50.280 --> 59:52.280
Fuck you. Yeah

59:53.280 --> 01:00:00.380
Now if the criticism is that the mainstream media lacks some sort of nuance in reporting on groups

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.500
Particularly like the bugs. Mmm. Yeah, sure fine. Great

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.640
I

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:11.800
Don't know if you've broken through that by being on Jimmy doors. I would say no. No, I would argue

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:16.400
No, but then you know, this is gonna wind up with this dumbass being all over the place

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:23.580
I imagine a bunch of easily taken advantage of morons like Jimmy door. Yeah, and maybe maybe the

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:30.000
Sort of high point of it will be him going on Tucker. Yeah, yeah

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.360
But I don't I don't know if I don't know if he has the escape trajectory to get out of that bubble very much

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:43.000
But that is interesting. I mean like it does it does indicate like the kind of places that he has access to

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.720
Includes infowars. Yeah, Jimmy door. Yeah

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:54.160
Yeah, that should that should put pause in a lot of people's minds. It's not a good sign. No, no

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.680
Also, hey, buddy

01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:01.920
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that most white supremacists would deny it

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:07.520
Yeah, and the the issue comes down to the the group is care

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.440
the character of the group itself is not white supremacist and a lot of I mean

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:17.680
Obviously there probably are a fair number of white supremacists who fall under the boogaloo

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.640
Oh, yeah category and that is fair enough

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:26.180
But the group itself is not white nationalist white

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:33.180
Supremacist in character right and that is something that's the nuance that is kind of difficult for people who aren't

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.700
Engaged in these things to really to really

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:43.780
Deliney and and that's where clunky conversations come in and you say like the white supremacist boogaloo group and then you

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.060
kind of look

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:48.060
Like you don't know what you're talking about

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:53.840
It's difficult even for me to fully understand where exactly a lot of the lines are

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.720
so Alex tries to have this conversation that is

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.640
far nicer than the one with Mike and

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:09.800
It's weird because the territory that Magnus is getting into should be really hostile stuff for Alex

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.800
Mm-hmm, like Magnus is

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.840
Defending antifa sure to Alex Jones indeed, and that's weird. This is a huge problem

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.600
Well, you believe in free speech antifa doesn't it's funded by Soros on record

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.600
I mean

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:31.120
That's the thing is like yeah that there might be infiltrated parts of it but you but that's the same for everything

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:36.640
That's something you talked about and like when I go back to like your early works about the WTO riots and how the police

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.600
Infiltrated the WTO riots to cause chaos and false flag

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:47.600
some of those same people that were at those WTO riots in Seattle are the same people that I talked to today that are part of

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:54.000
Antifa and they get really disillusioned when they hear things about like all of antifa's Soros funded a lot of them talk

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.840
Just like you they hate the Fed. They hate global, you know corporations

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.120
They stand for free speech

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:03.800
But Fox News or something will put the camera on one guy that has a stupid opinion and be like

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.520
Oh, they speak for all of antifa when it's when it's a global

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:11.920
I will invite any of those antiphon that'll actually talk to us. I'd love to actually hear that if that exists

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.960
This is a problem for Alex because he has contracts

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:19.680
No one is supposed to remember the things I say

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.840
Well, that's a problem

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:25.520
But also if Alex actually believed that the quote-unquote Soros

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:31.720
Antifa contracts the Harrison Smith found on 4chan were real right this argument should not be compelling to him

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:34.240
Yeah, this argument should be like no do you understand?

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.240
I have contracts between Alexander Soros

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:41.720
Excuse George Soros and their foundations and antifa in order to try and start martial law in America

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:50.120
You sir, don't know you're being tricked by the people on the ground who are who are old-time commies

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.120
Yeah

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.120
That's that's how you should be behaving

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:58.040
He shouldn't be he shouldn't be persuadable by stuff like this if anything that he believes means anything

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:03.240
Listen up Magnus Ver Magnusson or whatever your name is. Let me tell you this right now

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:08.320
Everyone in antifa had to sign a contract. I've got the document for you right here

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:13.320
Go ahead and read through that. Oh, no, I'm an idiot aren't I? Oh, no that guy remembered something

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:18.680
I said, I think that Alex probably doesn't bring that stuff up because Magnus would laugh in his face

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:24.160
I don't think that it would be embarrassing. That's why Alex's narratives fall apart

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.960
Yeah, like because they're built on nothing. Yeah, Alex himself doesn't believe them and

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:36.120
When presented with somebody who probably isn't gonna play along. This is what I keep coming into. Is that like Alex?

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.120
should not

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.720
Engage with zealots. Yeah, he's a pretend zealot

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:44.740
Yes, and he's going to get found out when you go up against a real one

01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.080
Yeah

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.160
The end and that's why he can't bring out his real

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.880
Narratives that uses all the time on his show because they'd be punctured so fast

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:58.760
He's at an instant disadvantage and somehow he still believes when he has these people on that. He's like nah, I got him

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.200
I can take care of it. Well stupid

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:09.320
so anyway, the great reset is the problem or something sure there needs to be a revolution probably and Magnus wants Alex to

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.320
Work with Antifa, of course

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:18.140
We should be able to unify everybody against the great reset is literally a corporate takeover to consolidate power under the name of environmentalism

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:23.920
To literally bankrupt everyone and and have a universal income so they can dictate the terms of our surrender

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:30.760
We have got to get everybody mobilized against the great reset. What is your view Magnus about the great reset? Oh, yeah

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:36.200
And I agree and it's funny enough because I had this conversation with an Antifa member. They agree, too

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:40.380
It's not that they're against the idea of like oh, let's reset the system everywhere

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:46.520
But they are perfectly aware of the people that are pushing that idea of how all these multinational billion-dollar banks and everything

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:51.080
It's not a great. Yeah, I love a reset exactly. We need a reset. We need a reset exactly

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:56.360
I'm gonna hold you over but we need a reset but it's not this reset. This is a horrible reset. Sorry go ahead

01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:03.600
there's a difference between a reset that involves rethinking our approach to climate issues rethinking our

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.320
approach to what

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.920
people need to live

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:13.780
That kind of thing and a reset that involves a civil war. Yeah

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.800
Yeah, those are very different and if you talk about them being like, oh well

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:22.880
Hey, these people are interested in a revolution just like us

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:26.640
You're muddying the waters in a way that is incredibly unfair

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:26.960
Yeah

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:33.820
and that is like when you engage in that kind of a disingenuous sleight of hand it leads me to

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:38.560
Suspect that maybe a lot of the stuff that you're saying is not sincere

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:45.200
Yeah, not genuine and that's one of the problems that I run into with Magnus and in this next clip

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.360
I think we really get to see this pretty clearly

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:53.160
Actually, I was just on the phone with the woman that was at the WTO riots

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.480
And she said she would would be willing to come on and talk to you

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:59.720
So if you want to talk to an Antifa member, you can talk to an Antifa member, please

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.400
And definitely like obviously the

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.960
Dictionary definition of acceleration nascent ism might be correct

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:11.480
But what everyone is calling us if by if by the criteria that you think everything is

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:16.880
Fundamentally flawed and it will not change without radical change then literally everyone is accelerationist

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:21.520
Joe Biden is an accelerationist AOC is an accelerationist Rand Paul's an accelerationist

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:26.360
Like if you look at the world through that view everyone acknowledges that things are totally

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:31.720
Destroyed across the board when it comes to civil liberties, when it comes to our economics, everything

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:36.280
Exactly. So like a lot of people say like, oh you want a revolution? You're an accelerationist

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:41.880
I'm like everyone wants a revolution right now. Everyone's talking about it. It trends on Twitter constantly. So this is

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.640
another

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:51.280
Manipulative sleight of hand. Oh, yeah, the accelerationism that people are talking about when they talk about fringe right-wing groups and militias

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.840
And and and that type is an accelerationism towards shooting violence

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:03.240
it's an accelerationism that's rooted in heightening tensions and highly tense situations and

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:09.840
protests that have the potential to spin out of hand and prove to be an inciting event in a

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.680
conflict between a

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.680
Supposed

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:20.120
Sides of a civil war we see the water boiling and we want to push it over the edge. That's the

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:25.240
accelerationism that he's trying to make the same as

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:33.600
Accelerationism where you have people who are saying climate change is a problem that cannot be ignored any longer. Yep

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.200
we need to

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.200
elect leaders who are willing to

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:43.600
Explore ideas about regulation. Yes. Okay. It's not the same

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:53.400
Recognizing that a system is flawed in many ways and we're past the point possibly even past the point where we can

01:08:54.280 --> 01:09:02.440
totally fix all of the issues sure is not the same as thinking everything is fucked and we should hope for a civil war because

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:06.480
It's gonna happen eventually. So why not do it now? I

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
That's dishonest

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:15.560
100% I I mean, yeah, I I understand this guy and you're you're 100% right good cop bad cop

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:20.680
Bullshit with these two but God I prefer the asshole from the other day

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:26.060
It's funnier cuz he and also he's just gonna be like, yeah, fuck. Yeah, let's blow it up

01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:30.720
You know, like I don't like this lying piece of shit coming at me with his accountant

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:35.280
But I think that Mike was still lying too. Oh, he was still trying to put on a

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.640
Shiny or facade Oh 100 to what he actually is believing and promoting

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.720
but yeah, this this is

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:52.120
Just intrinsically on like unfair. Yeah. Yeah, like what he's what he's presenting and it's it's intentional

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:58.040
Because he kind of understands that there's a lot of Alex's audience. That's probably poachable

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.960
No, and it's hard to it's like bring up AOC and all I think of is

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:08.320
Ted Cruz being like yeah agree and AOC being like hey you tried to murder me go fuck yourself

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.360
Well, guess what? I get it

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:16.120
You can bring up how antifa and BLM are also against the Fed or whatever it is you want

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.880
But you tried to murder all of us. So go fuck yourself

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:25.860
well, but the and the other problem too is that I do I I do think that there probably are some

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:33.540
accelerationist types on the left sure you can rationalize I'm sure way to that like if you take the issue of like

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:39.880
Climate change you can find eco-fascists. You can find eco-terrorists. Yeah

01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:43.240
that's not the mainstream of

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:45.140
And and you know

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:52.140
I would say that probably the boogaloo boys are a little bit outside of the strict mainstream of the right

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:59.980
But they're closer than eco-terrorists are to the mainstream of the left. Yes, I would agree a great deal and and and comparing

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:03.540
You know, I don't know. I don't know if he would do this but

01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.100
Comparing like I don't know

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.140
gun wielding

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:12.340
Accelerationists to protests to Greta Thunberg. I think it's a

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:16.500
Little bit different. Yeah a little bit different. I remember Greta

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:19.220
bringing in her AR to the

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:26.820
UN I remember that didn't she do that when she gave that speech? Yeah, I recall so Magnus wants peaceful

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:29.680
options sure now again

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:35.860
Did you leave a public representative of a group that is entirely based around the fantasy of a second Civil War?

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:38.140
to the point where

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:43.940
This listener pointed this out to me and I knew this but I failed to bring it up on our last episode

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:48.560
You know, even the wearing Hawaiian shirts is about Civil War

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:55.580
It's they had to get around social media bands. And so they had big luau instead of boogaloo. Yep

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.620
Like everything is about every day. Yeah, but he wants peaceful options

01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:01.520
Okay

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:08.460
And I think that he is one Alex over to an embarrassing extent and we need to keep trying to push peaceful options

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:10.820
We need to keep finding cracks in the armor to be peaceful

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:17.860
But they continue to shut those avenues down one after another another if they keep doing that and that was my warning to them

01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:19.860
In that speech if they keep denying people

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:23.340
Redress keep denying people the ability to change things

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:29.620
Then you're going to have civil conflict and it's going to be really bad for them for us and for everyone involved

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:34.820
Come back on cuz I'm really impressed and I'm glad that you actually came on

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:36.860
I'd love to have you on with the antifa lady

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:41.780
We want to have them on we want to actually reach out to these folks as I understand that we can all drink the mainstream

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:45.740
Media kool-aid at a certain point need to actually hear what these groups actually stand for

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:50.060
You're not drinking the mainstream media kool-aid. It's your kool-aid. Yeah

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:55.980
Magnus has got Alex so on the ropes that he's willing to work with antifa. Yeah

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:03.540
Doesn't China run antifa? It's just it's hard not to see that like oh well

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:08.980
You're just nicer to Alex, you know, like he of course he agrees with all of this shit

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:15.460
Theoretically in his mind, you know, but this guy's being nicer than Mike Dunn. So well

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:20.580
Yeah, you guys might have a good point. You're being real deferential and I don't see you as a physical threat

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:26.100
So I think we're good to go who knows like how this would have gone if Magnus was the first one

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:27.300
Yeah, talk to Alex

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:32.700
But I I don't think that this interview can be seen outside of the context of the prior one

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:33.020
Yeah

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:38.820
That went very badly for a hundred percent and it's not like I mean you'd have to be delusional to think that Mike

01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:40.820
And Magnus don't know each other. Yeah

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:49.900
The night between these two interviews about Alex get him believe you call them a controlled opposition to his face. What a moron

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:53.260
Okay. Now I'm gonna go on and tell him that antifa is cool

01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:56.220
I saw I saw one interview he did with Steve pachannik

01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:59.980
All you got to do is say that he's a good dude who's super smart and then don't believe anything

01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:01.980
yeah, this is embarrassing and

01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:07.620
Alex is just stupid. Yeah, so bad. So speaking of

01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:09.620
a dangerous bad

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:13.020
Interviews now Stuart Rhodes of the Oath Keepers comes in great

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:17.420
good work Alex is not into this idea that some of them got arrested and

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:19.940
It's just kind of like I don't buy it

01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:22.420
shifting gears Stuart Rhodes is a

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:31.100
Retired constitutional lawyer award-winning researcher you name it. What awards do army veteran patriot founder of Oath Keepers?

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:35.180
It's always about non-violent defensive protection of America

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:37.440
Since we've seen the big news three Oath Keepers

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:42.820
Arrested plotted to kill members of Congress. They do a very good job. They're at the Capitol just running around

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:49.060
Whoa, I don't buy any of that. They all went woo. Woo. Woo. They were like Jeffrey Osborn

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:54.420
Can you whoa, whoa, whoa, you know that song it is it's kind of astonishing

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:59.340
do you remember how quickly don't talk about Jeffrey people hand wave a

01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:02.900
literal violent coup yeah, it's

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:04.380
astonishing

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:10.940
Well, it's so important for people like Alex and people on the right to do that because it's so indicative of

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:18.680
The sort of danger that they present to a civil insane society. Someone could say that the enemy is with it

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:25.900
It's very important that the hand waving happens. I just don't understand why people who

01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:29.720
Are on the other side don't keep stressing this

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:34.440
In in in a really aggressive way cowardice money

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:40.960
I think I think maybe but I think also just kind of like we all are just exhausted

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.640
That's part of just fucking tired this goddamn

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:48.160
Pandemic and then these guys took over the country and all I want to do is go to bed

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:53.740
Yeah, a lot of the time whenever I'm you know, getting an episode ready Alex will say something. I'm like

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:59.060
Oh, yeah, yeah, and then I have to like deal with it

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:04.020
Yeah, and I think that sometimes in life you run into walls like that and you just don't want to deal with it

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:04.460
Mm-hmm

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:10.700
I think that maybe some people don't want to deal with that and hand waving is the good way to do it

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:15.140
I mean when you but for Alex, it's it's an existential threat. Yes 100%

01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:23.360
Recognizing that his worldview implies this yeah is is really dangerous. This is the logical conclusion of what you say

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:28.360
Mm-hmm the end this is not some like infiltration. This is not some like oops

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:31.320
We were meaning to do this and then this happened

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:36.600
This is what the end goal was and you did it stupid and you lost. Mm-hmm the end

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:42.400
Unlike Jeffrey Osborne who won I was doing so hard

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:48.200
I'm not so hard. I was just zeroed in on not talking about that in terms of awards

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:52.560
Stuart Rhodes, I don't know what the case is here

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.040
He when he was at Yale

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:59.680
He apparently won an award for a paper on enemy combatant status that he wrote

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.740
I was able to find the paper and it's long

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:07.520
And I didn't read all of it, but I read some of it and I was like, yeah, this seems like a college paper

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:09.520
yeah, and

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.960
It would have been I think 2004

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.960
and conveniently

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.000
Yale

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.240
Their records online go back to 2005. Oh

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:27.080
So weird. Yeah, so I was able to find the recipients list of these winners until 2005

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:31.840
That's not to say that Stewart didn't win it. I just know I'd sure sure sure. Yeah, he could have

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.920
It reminds me of Mumford the movie Mumford. Oh

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:38.840
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I fakes being a

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:46.360
Psychologist. Yeah conveniently everybody who could verify his time in college died. So weird. Yeah, so weird

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.200
Yeah, we've we've met some people like that in the past

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.760
so

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:54.560
Stewart is kind of like hey

01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:01.520
We're in the situation that our founding fathers were in and so what we need to do is set up autonomous cities

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:07.880
I think okay, make sure you do what the founders did they came together. They were united the town and county level

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.040
for mutual defense and also for

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:17.760
Grassroots politics they separated themselves from an illegitimate regime even before they declared independence, you know

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.120
They didn't listen to the real governors

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:25.040
They they smuggled and went around all the edicts of the king and they wore a homespun clothing

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.740
Stop buying textiles from England. They

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:33.940
That's like moonshine. All of this is pure Americana. I agree everybody. They're trying to drive us underground

01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:38.060
Let's jump in that briar patch. Let's just let's just stop supporting them in any way

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:45.160
Alex is currently in a luxury resort in Utah. He has an iPhone in his pocket

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:50.340
This is this is ridiculous God. Yeah, I hate these people so much

01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:55.980
It's it's a bit of a mess, but not as much of a mess as Alex's narrative about January 6th

01:18:55.980 --> 01:19:01.460
Yes, this is a huge problem for him because as we've seen he's had to gradually expand the narrative

01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:03.580
based on

01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:07.980
New people who get arrested. Yeah, we're on our seventh or eighth iteration of this narrative

01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:12.140
Yeah, and it's falling the fuck apart. Yeah, and one of the reasons for that is

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:17.220
The people that he's tried to blame the boogaloo boys stood up to him

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:20.820
Oh, and he got embarrassed by two of them in two days

01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:28.140
Yeah, he can't throw the oath keepers under the bus. He's too connected to them. Stuart Rhodes is his good buddy

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:31.140
Yep, they're they're tight. He can't do it

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:37.860
The proud boys. He also probably can't throw them under the bus completely. Joe Biggs was like the second-in-command

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:43.580
He used to work at Infowars, Enrique Tarrio. Yeah, they were independent contractors. He never met him

01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:46.100
He doesn't get into that kind of stuff that those people get in

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:51.500
Enrique Tarrio had been on the show before he spoke at Alex's CPAC event. You can't prove any of this

01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:55.380
Alex could be like I was in bed drunk

01:19:56.740 --> 01:20:01.140
He probably could. I don't remember Tarrio. I don't remember anything from that night

01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:30.880
It's too difficult for him. And so now he has to kind of like do this. Welcome back ladies and gentlemen. Stuart Rhodes founder of the Oath Keepers is here with us and he just learned about this in the last 12 hours or so. Self-styled militia members in three states begin planning in November for recruits, weapons ahead of capital, and

01:20:31.140 --> 01:21:00.500
breach US siege. Well, they sure didn't bring the weapons and they sure didn't do all the things they supposedly were planning to do. But it was the Q phenomenon behind the scenes that oh secretly Trump's giving orders to storm DC and all this and then it would piggyback on us having peaceful demonstrations, calling for a Senate investigation that Ted Cruz was calling for. And then you get to demonize the entire Trump system with this badly coordinated few hundred people that wanted to storm the Capitol.

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:13.220
Hell, you get a few Proud Boys, you get a few Boogaloos, you get a few Oath Keepers in the mix. Are they informants? Were they set up? They break in. Okay, four of them get killed. Cop has a heart attack, dies two days later. This is the new Pearl Harbor.

01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:36.180
So the narrative now is just so intensely complicated and shifted so far over the course of the last couple weeks that to imagine somebody continuing to go along with this is just embarrassing. Because Alex at every stage has said he's proven all of these things and then everything shifts.

01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:55.780
So now Q, the Q movement is the real villain. And there's a couple of people who I guess Alex will probably, I'm gonna guess soon he's gonna say Sheepdipped. He's gonna call these people Sheepdipped. There's gonna be a couple Sheepdipped people in each of these groups that were there as infiltrated provocateurs.

01:21:55.780 --> 01:22:06.580
And so all these groups are actually good, just they had a couple people who were bad apples in those groups who were actually globalist plants. This is too complicated.

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:20.580
I guess he has too many Q followers that listen to his show, but if it were me I would just go hard on Q being controlled by the globalists the whole way. Turn all the Q people into globalists.

01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:22.020
No, that's kind of where he's at.

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:28.900
Right, but I mean straight up clean break. Everything is their fault because they're the globalists.

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:42.580
Sure. Well, that's interesting. I think it would be difficult to argue that all the people who believe in Q are aware of a globalist plot that they're a part of.

01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:43.220
Sure.

01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:48.100
And so he's saying that the Q is globalist intelligence and stuff like that.

01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:48.740
Right.

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:56.980
But the people who fell for it and were in on it, or the followers, they're just good researchers who got taken down the wrong path.

01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:06.740
I know, but you can lump them in with all the people who use it. You know, most rank and file Democrats aren't evil people. They've just been caught up in this whole thing. You just rationalize the Q.

01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:09.300
Alex says that everyone on the left is a devil.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.620
Well, sometimes he does and sometimes he doesn't.

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:12.500
Depends on his mood.

01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:13.140
Exactly.

01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:20.420
Yeah, I don't know. I strain to keep any kind of...

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.140
Through line?

01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:23.780
Well, yeah, through line or belief that Alex even has a through line.

01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:24.820
Yeah, I would agree with that.

01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:30.980
I don't think he has a center on this narrative. It's just someone's to blame and it's not us. It's a fake group that's controlled by the globalists.

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:35.540
That's why I'm saying you go with Q and then you go up against a Boogaloo boy and they're like,

01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:45.060
you're stupid and you're like, no, no, no, this is all Q shit, man. You are the stupid ones. You are being controlled by the globalists who run Q.

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:50.900
I don't know. I think Alex realizes that the new generation is not going to put up with his bullshit.

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:52.420
No, that doesn't seem like it.

01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:58.260
So, Stuart Rhodes is not like Alex in many ways. He's scarier.

01:23:58.260 --> 01:23:58.820
Terrifying.

01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:03.860
And he also is not somebody who throws people under the bus.

01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:04.340
That's true.

01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:10.260
Alex is willing to throw anybody under the bus immediately. When it's convenient, bus.

01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:17.220
Yeah, I imagine that military service will give you more loyalty to your comrades in arms than

01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:19.220
being a radio host.

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:26.820
Yeah, so one of the people that was arrested, Storm in the Capital, one of the three Oathkeepers,

01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:32.420
Stuart Rhodes knows for a fact, is an Oathkeeper. And he won't deny that. And he also spent some

01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:34.500
time on this show promoting her crowdfunding.

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:36.020
Yeah, I love that. I love it.

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:40.980
Jessica Watkins does have a GoFundMe set up or not a GoFundMe. It's on rally pay,

01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:46.500
but a fundraiser for her. We do encourage people to go and defend the actual Oathkeeper member

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:50.820
who was involved in that. So we always stand behind our people. So there you go.

01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:53.860
But again, you didn't coordinate. You weren't part of this.

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.540
No, absolutely not.

01:24:55.540 --> 01:25:00.820
I had nothing to do with it. Now I am going to try and help fund the defense of somebody

01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:09.060
who is there because they're my people. That is a kind of loyalty that is foreign to Infowars.

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:15.140
Completely. So wait, wait, wait. Are you saying that she did a thing that you personally think

01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:21.380
was a bad idea, but you're still going to defend her? But if you threw her under the bus, then

01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:23.540
maybe you wouldn't have to deal with it at all.

01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:24.740
Yeah, you could keep that money.

01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:27.460
Yeah, it'd be your money. Don't you want that money?

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:33.860
So we are now in a situation that is exactly the same, 100% the same.

01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:35.540
Identical to the founders.

01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:39.620
Well, the colonies. In the colonies. We're basically in the colonies.

01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:39.860
Okay.

01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:43.780
Stuart, what do you expect them to do with Biden? He's deteriorating

01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:47.700
extremely quickly. I mean, he looks like an Alzheimer's patient now. I mean,

01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:51.940
they definitely cranked him up and he practiced that very short inaugural speech, which was okay.

01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:52.660
10 bags of blood.

01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:54.500
Other than that, he's like, what am I signing?

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:57.780
Blah, blah, blah. I mean, he is like, what the hell's going on here?

01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:05.220
Well, like I was saying, he is a Chinese puppet. You should look at this as DC is now the green

01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:11.940
zone of an occupying army from communist China using their puppet. And that's why it's a direct

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:16.500
parallel the founders faced. They were dealing with domestic puppets, the royal governors,

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:21.540
who were doing the bidding of a foreign power that was king in parliament that the people had

01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:26.020
no control over and no representation in. And we're in the same exact position.

01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:27.620
Exact same position.

01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:31.540
Exact same position. Explain to me how they're in the exact same position.

01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:33.460
Stuart just did, man.

01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:35.700
I disagree strongly.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:42.740
Sure. Me too. So Stuart is, you know, he's not an accelerationist except he is.

01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:47.380
Pretty sure he said we're in the colonies and I'm pretty sure that what that required was a

01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:48.420
literal revolution.

01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:51.540
Yeah, but before that they had people writing pamphlets and stuff.

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:55.860
Oh, so the Oath Keepers are very similar to Thomas Paine.

01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:01.220
One might, one were they to be Stuart Rhodes might say yes.

01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:09.300
Stuart, he's trying to have this like, you know, like, hey, it's not time for action or whatever

01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:16.500
yet, but he does give a little bit of a contradictory message here and it's upsetting.

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:21.060
That shows their weakness because they can't even trust their own troops because they know

01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:26.500
that those troops come from us. And so what they do is try to purge the troops and kick

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:31.300
out anybody who's a real American. They really have a skeleton force of no strong military

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:35.380
in the United States that is controlled by them than to have a powerful military they

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:39.540
can't control when they when they try to give orders to violate our rights. So watch for

01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:46.500
that. We're going in territory heading towards a sweet spot where we can't wait too much

01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:51.700
longer because then they'll have vetted and kicked out all the patriots out of the military.

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:52.180
Confederates.

01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:55.780
They have not gotten there yet, but watch for that process to happen. As you get closer

01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:59.460
and closer to that point, you have to do something. That's where we're going.

01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:03.460
That's right. Let's talk about, both of you stay there, let's talk about the timeline

01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:06.820
of tyranny, what the Globals are going to do next, what we've got to do. I mean, folks,

01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:10.420
nobody's happy about this. A country has cancer. Again, they're trying to purge the

01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:14.500
military now. We told you that was coming next. And now it's here. We got to take the

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.660
last three minutes of Stewart, put that on the front of this interview. That was

01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:22.420
where he let it out. Literally, DC is now the commonest Chinese green zone. We'll be

01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:23.220
right back.

01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:29.140
So you have Stewart saying that there's a sweet spot that is, you know, like where you

01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:34.260
have to do something before the military is done purging. Also the military has started

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:34.740
purging.

01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:36.420
Well, that puts a clock on it.

01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:36.980
It does.

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:38.340
It sure does, doesn't it Dan?

01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:40.340
This is the revolution QVC.

01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:45.700
We're not into acceleration. What we are saying is that it's going to happen shortly.

01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:49.060
Anybody, we got about 45, 50 minutes?

01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:50.900
Yeah, that's not good.

01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:51.460
Yeah.

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:54.900
So the 28th wraps up and...

01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:56.180
Blackjack! Shit.

01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:56.820
Nope.

01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:57.700
You're so good.

01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:58.820
You're so good at this.

01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:01.620
29th, Alex is, like I said, on the road.

01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:01.940
Yeah.

01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:02.660
He's coming back for Utah.

01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:03.140
Travel day.

01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:10.500
30th, sorry, Alex and Stewart Rhodes are in studio and they're talking about this dumb

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:13.380
documentary, talking about how they got us a seed and shit.

01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:13.700
Yeah.

01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:14.340
Very stupid.

01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:14.980
Yeah.

01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:21.940
Now we get to the 31st Sunday episode and Alex is basically describing how we're in

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:22.580
Revelation.

01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:23.300
Okay.

01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:28.500
But it is said in the book of Revelation that John the Revelator in the Isle of Patmos

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:35.460
marveled at the beast, looking forward through an interdimensional wormhole that God opened

01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:35.860
up.

01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:37.140
That part wasn't in the Bible.

01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:39.940
The Antichrist and the world government, what would be happening in the future.

01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:42.340
He marveled at the beast.

01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:46.660
World government cannot buy nor sell without a mark on the forehead of the hand.

01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:48.980
You must turn over your children to the state.

01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:51.380
You must destroy your very genetics.

01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:52.260
You must kill the earth.

01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:56.100
You must worship Satan or you will not be allowed to live.

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.580
You'll not be allowed to have a job.

01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:04.100
Well, whether you believe John was the greatest science fiction writer ever 2000 years ago.

01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:04.740
He was not.

01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:07.380
Or whether you believe he was inspired by God.

01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:07.940
He was not.

01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:10.580
It's being manifested.

01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:12.340
It is not.

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:15.140
It's being set up right now.

01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:21.780
So the old Chinese proverb says, may you live in interesting times.

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:24.820
And we certainly are interesting times.

01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:27.540
And then you have the battle of Armageddon with the dragon.

01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:31.860
All the rest of it now unfolding.

01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:40.660
So get your popcorn out because you got front row seats to the big finale.

01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:44.820
Is it 10 years, 100 years out or 60 minutes away?

01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:47.380
All I know is it's satanic and it's moving quick.

01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:48.820
Wait, so it might be in an hour.

01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:52.900
The dragon might be here in an hour.

01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:53.220
Okay.

01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:55.540
Okay, so this is not fair.

01:30:55.540 --> 01:30:56.660
I've got a pitch for you.

01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:59.620
Actually, I've got a pitch for the devil or the great beast, if you will.

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:00.340
Hold on, hold on.

01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:01.940
Let me, let me get into character.

01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:03.860
Okay, there you go.

01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:05.140
That was scary.

01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:06.980
You surprised me.

01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:08.020
She popped out of that portal.

01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:08.500
Okay.

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.980
So you've got the book of revelations.

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:15.860
You've got this whole like head or the hand on the mark of the beast, right?

01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:19.860
But you're the devil and you realize everyone has a phone.

01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:23.940
Hmm, so do you get around the entire book of revelations?

01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:29.140
If you just never attach it to somebody's hand or forehead, do you just win?

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:32.420
Does he win if everybody has the mark of the beast in their pocket?

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:38.420
Well, I mean, it would certainly seem to indicate that the prophecy was a little bit screwy.

01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:38.900
Yeah.

01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:39.540
Oh, yeah.

01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:42.260
What about like, um, I don't know.

01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:45.620
Like there's so much that, uh, aren't in any of those prophecies.

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:48.420
Like, uh, like, uh, custard.

01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:49.780
That's true.

01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:50.500
Well, I don't know.

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:53.780
Maybe custard existed back then.

01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:54.900
What am I trying to think of?

01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:56.260
I have no idea.

01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:58.820
I don't know where custard came from at all.

01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:00.100
French fries?

01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.140
They did not have those.

01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:02.020
Pizza?

01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:02.660
That's true.

01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:04.100
They didn't even have France back then.

01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:07.700
I don't know what I'm trying to get at.

01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:09.620
They were called gall fries back then.

01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:13.620
There were, there, there were some, some things that were missing, uh, from the,

01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:17.540
in terms of it being a wormhole vision of the present.

01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:18.660
Uh, but yeah, I don't know.

01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:22.420
I just think it's unfair for Alex to be like, it could be a hundred years, could be an hour.

01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:23.540
Get your popcorn out.

01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:26.900
You might die before it starts, but you'll have the popcorn ready.

01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:30.500
The devil's here and it's happening and it's happening fast.

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:31.380
Or in a hundred years.

01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:32.100
And who knows?

01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:35.940
So, uh, the big news is, uh, vaccine related.

01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:36.260
Yes.

01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:37.300
On Sunday.

01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:41.860
And it's that, uh, Australia has ended, uh, its COVID development program.

01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:43.860
So now here's the big announcement.

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:50.340
A month ago, Australia suspends nationwide, their entire vaccine program, because it's

01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:55.700
makes people deathly ill, killed a bunch of people and they came up positive for HIV.

01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:58.100
Well, we put that on screen place for TV viewers.

01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:07.700
Now, now, ladies and gentlemen, last Tuesday seems like a hundred years ago,

01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:12.980
Merck, the largest pharma company in the world says we are ending our vaccine program.

01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:14.100
It does not work.

01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:18.980
We believe you cannot make a vaccine that works to cure the common cold.

01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:22.820
And that's what this is, except it's chimera with even more mutations.

01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:24.340
So it's even more impossible.

01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:27.780
Alex is a sort of editorializing on what these companies have said.

01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:30.260
He's adding a little bit there on his own.

01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:30.500
Yeah.

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:33.060
I would say, I would say that wasn't a direct quotation.

01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:33.380
Yeah.

01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:36.500
The other problem too, is that these are all different vaccines.

01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:37.700
There is that.

01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:41.780
Like the one in Australia was developed by the university of Queensland and a biotech

01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:47.860
firm called CSL and the ones that Merck are different, the ones they were working on.

01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:51.860
And those are also different than the Pfizer and the Moderna ones.

01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:53.620
Nah, they're all fake.

01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:54.660
It's all fake vaccines.

01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:56.500
Alex is treating them like they're all the same thing.

01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:57.540
They're all the same thing.

01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:01.060
It's a syringe with some liquid in it, Dan.

01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:01.940
It's the same shit.

01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:03.220
It's very weird.

01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:03.460
Yeah.

01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:04.660
It's a weird perspective.

01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:07.060
It's kind of like he doesn't understand anything about them.

01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:07.460
Yeah.

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:08.820
So I actually lied to you.

01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:09.860
That's not the news.

01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:12.020
That's the preface for the news.

01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:14.500
The big news has to do with Emmanuel Macron.

01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:14.900
Okay.

01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:17.060
French president has come out and said some things.

01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:20.820
Who came out yesterday, Macron, a top globalist.

01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:23.940
But he understands that this is such a crime.

01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:25.300
He'll be torn limb from limb.

01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:26.820
The riots are gigantic.

01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:28.820
All their scientists are coming out saying, this is insane.

01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:30.100
The top ones.

01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:32.180
As opposed to the other ones?

01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:36.340
The discoverer of HIV, who's a French scientist and saying, it's man-made in the lab.

01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:37.060
It's a power grab.

01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:42.100
I told you months ago, I talked to the head of a major biotech company that has real gene

01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:44.500
therapy that cures things like colon cancer.

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:45.860
They also sell pillows.

01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:47.140
And he said, you're absolutely right.

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:49.460
It's a giant total takeover.

01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:54.260
The vaccine will destroy and sterilize women, and it will kill your immune system or turn

01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:55.940
it way off the charts and give you cancer.

01:34:57.780 --> 01:34:59.300
But they need to want to come on the show.

01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:00.660
Oh, too bad.

01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:01.060
Yeah.

01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:08.340
For somebody with knowledge that could potentially save billions of people, it seems like he

01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:10.180
would want to get that information out there.

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:10.580
Yeah.

01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:13.300
I guess he's now responsible for...

01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:14.820
I'm pretty sure he's killed us all.

01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:21.380
So French President Macron said that the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine appears to be, quote,

01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:27.860
quasi-ineffective in people older than 65, which is a claim that scientists have strongly

01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:28.580
rebutted.

01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:29.940
What about the top ones, though?

01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:31.220
I don't know what that means.

01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:31.700
Okay.

01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:35.780
Macron did not come out against the vaccine or vaccination, nor is he trying to save himself

01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:37.300
from being torn limb from limb.

01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:42.340
Also, this is not the same vaccine as the ones put out by Pfizer and Moderna, which

01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:45.060
are the ones that are currently available in the United States.

01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:49.940
The claims that Alex is making are absurd, and it's super convenient that this big time

01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:52.820
specialist with magical medical technology won't come on the show.

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:54.980
But honestly, this is just dumb.

01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:57.460
One of the things that's the most dumb about this...

01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:58.660
Drum roll, please, Jordan.

01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:00.580
Okay.

01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:01.380
Good enough.

01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:06.020
The AstraZeneca vaccine that Macron is talking about isn't an mRNA vaccine.

01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:06.500
Well...

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:07.860
But Alex doesn't know that.

01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:12.180
If you were a member of the InfoWars audience, you would think that all these vaccines that

01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:16.180
were getting developed were all the same thing, as if a ton of companies were just racing

01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:17.860
to finish the same recipe.

01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:19.620
But that's not the case.

01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:23.780
These are different approaches being taken with varying levels of success and setbacks.

01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:27.620
Alex doesn't understand the basics of the topics he's covering, and he doesn't care

01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:30.340
to, because his work is not meant to reflect reality.

01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:31.940
It's meant to push an agenda.

01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:32.500
Yeah.

01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:38.580
And this is just really sad, because all his ideas are about mRNA vaccines being different

01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:39.780
than vaccines.

01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:41.940
And that's why this is particularly evil.

01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:43.300
And Macron knows that.

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:48.260
And that's why he's getting rid of this Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine that it turns out isn't

01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:49.620
an mRNA vaccine.

01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:50.980
But Alex doesn't know that.

01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:58.340
Macron claims that the vaccine that they were going to use is an mRNA vaccine.

01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:03.780
AstraZeneca is almost ineffective in over 65s.

01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:05.060
Alex doesn't know shit.

01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:06.180
He doesn't know anything.

01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:07.540
He's talking out of his ass.

01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:09.780
And so this is how arguments get made.

01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:14.420
So Australia, Merck, France does not work.

01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:15.460
Does not work.

01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:16.500
Does not work.

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:17.540
Does not work.

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:18.500
Does not work.

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:19.700
Does not work.

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.140
That's it.

01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:23.300
That's the level of shit he's bringing to the table.

01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:24.180
That's compelling.

01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:24.500
Yeah.

01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:25.700
That is compelling.

01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:31.140
I remember going to my first year.

01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:34.580
I didn't originally start out in literature.

01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:37.140
I originally started out in audio production.

01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:41.220
And I was there, and I was looking at the board, going through all this stuff.

01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:44.580
And I remember my teacher screaming at me, it works!

01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:45.140
It works!

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:46.340
Yeah.

01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:46.820
It works!

01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:53.380
Yeah, I think that part of the game that's being played here is like, the audience is

01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:55.220
obviously humans.

01:37:55.220 --> 01:38:02.580
And they think that if someone is yelling this repeatedly, over and over again, so definitively.

01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:03.460
He believes it.

01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:05.540
He can't possibly be making this up.

01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:09.460
How could you be this confident and make something up at the same time?

01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:10.580
People can't do that.

01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:12.420
It's not possible, Dan.

01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:14.260
It's simply inconceivable.

01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:15.860
And unfortunately.

01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:16.420
Here we are.

01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:17.140
Yeah.

01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:23.060
So Alex has some staggering statistics about this vaccine that I would beg him to demonstrate.

01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:25.460
Guess who the vaccine's killing?

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:28.500
Not just the famous baseball player.

01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:29.700
Hank Aaron.

01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:31.940
The vaccine killed him?

01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:35.540
Local news every day of 20-year-olds, 50-year-olds, 60-year-olds, 30-year-olds.

01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:38.820
Take it and die before they even leave the clinic.

01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:39.460
They collapse.

01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:43.460
And then have a convulsion and bye-bye an hour later.

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:47.300
Bye-bye, Bluebird.

01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:48.660
But it gets even more insane.

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:53.860
I mean, this is absolutely the biggest criminal power grab ever.

01:38:55.380 --> 01:39:01.060
They are reporting in hospitals and in nursing homes that up to 5% of the patients are dying

01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:03.860
within a week when they take the mRNA shot.

01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:05.300
Holy shit.

01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:09.540
5% fatality rate?

01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:11.140
Alex, you need to demonstrate this.

01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:12.740
That's an outrageous clinic.

01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:14.180
This is an arrestable offense.

01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:18.180
That is a legit, like, there should be a legal...

01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:19.380
I mean...

01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:20.260
That's insane.

01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:20.740
You could.

01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:26.980
I mean, you'd need to somehow demonstrate that, like, him saying that people believed

01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:30.820
it and it led to harm, but I don't think that that...

01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:33.060
Like, I don't know how you'd prove it, but I believe it.

01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:33.300
Yeah.

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:35.060
Like, I believe that that causes harm.

01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:36.100
Absolutely.

01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:37.140
Without question.

01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:39.140
5% mortality rate?

01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:40.740
Without question.

01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:41.700
That's outrageous.

01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:43.140
That's fucked up.

01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:44.340
So fucked up.

01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:45.940
That's a made up number.

01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:48.900
That would be the number one story in history.

01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:56.580
Culmination of all of humanity's knowledge about infectious disease results in 5% of

01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:58.260
people dying immediately.

01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:03.780
Yeah, I don't think that you get to make claims like that willy nilly.

01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:05.940
And he is.

01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:09.940
Yeah, if you can't yell fire in a crowded theater, you can't tell everybody that they're

01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:10.820
gonna die.

01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:11.140
Yeah.

01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:11.620
Yeah.

01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:15.300
So the vaccines are a bio weapon, apparently.

01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:20.660
And I would like to stress this important point that I've brought up that I don't think

01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:27.540
that Alex knows or cares that these vaccines are all different vaccines and some are not

01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:29.620
mRNA vaccines like he thinks.

01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:32.740
They're closing in to shut everybody down right now.

01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:34.500
We have to expose their behind this.

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:38.260
We have to expose the criminal takeover plan and we have to get world leaders, starting

01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:42.580
with governors and starting with senators to come out and point this out and it's game

01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:42.980
over.

01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:44.980
Well, what do you think Merck knows?

01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:45.620
What do you think?

01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:46.740
Macron knows?

01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:52.340
What do you think the Australians know suspending their vaccine programs because it quote does

01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:54.420
not work and hurts people.

01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:56.980
Quote because it does work.

01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:57.700
Macron.

01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:58.580
It does work.

01:40:58.580 --> 01:40:59.140
Merck.

01:40:59.140 --> 01:40:59.860
It does work.

01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:00.500
Australia.

01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:05.060
It's a frickin bio weapon.

01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:11.780
The mRNA vaccines are gene therapy and they train your body to attack a protein that's

01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:12.420
in the placenta.

01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:15.300
All four of the damn things are the same thing.

01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:19.540
Well, one of them, at least, that you were bringing up isn't an mRNA vaccine.

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:20.820
Well, there's that problem.

01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:23.540
And that whole thing about attacking the placenta is nonsense, but-

01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:24.100
There is that.

01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:26.580
I just, I don't know.

01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:28.580
This is desperate.

01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:29.140
Yep.

01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:29.700
Yep.

01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:35.300
Anyway, we don't have time for us to all wait.

01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:40.740
The inevitable thing that's going to happen, as has always happened, is that Alex says

01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:44.820
something, it sounds silly, and then 20 years later, what do you know, Alex is right.

01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:45.780
Always comes true.

01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:46.740
Always.

01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:52.100
We're living in exactly what Alex predicted we would be in 1991.

01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:58.660
If there's one thing I've learned from doing this podcast, it's don't ever forget

01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:00.340
don't ever doubt Alex.

01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:05.140
His shit stands up to scrutiny.

01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:05.640
True.

01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:08.580
He's right almost all the time.

01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:12.340
Even when it contradicts other things he's almost always right about?

01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:13.220
Yeah, yeah.

01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:16.020
Be very facetious.

01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:18.340
Never believe Alex.

01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:21.220
He's very dumb and mostly is just talking shit.

01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:24.260
Half the time, he doesn't even remember the shit he says.

01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:25.140
Doesn't care.

01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:27.300
But we don't have time to wait for him to be proven right.

01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:31.300
We need to act on the things that he's saying now, and just trust that in 20 years

01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:33.700
we'll look back and be like, thank god we listened to Alex.

01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:37.060
I just don't trust people who make me want, who say I should do that.

01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:37.700
No.

01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:39.300
Very, very dangerous types.

01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:40.020
Yeah.

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:44.500
We don't have time for people to say 20 years later Alex Jones was right again.

01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:45.460
Or a year later.

01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:47.460
We gotta get that it's not about who's right.

01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:49.940
The enemy has written books and laid out their plans.

01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:51.300
Of course I know their plans.

01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:52.660
It's so easy to beat them.

01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:54.420
It's a complete criminal takeover.

01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:58.900
They said in Operation Lockstep, 11 years ago, Rockefeller Foundation, which John Hopkins,

01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:01.380
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, go read it.

01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:02.180
It's online.

01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:03.700
We do.

01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:10.180
They bring in a planetary police state by disease X, something like a weaponized cold

01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:14.180
virus, and that there'd be no way to ever defeat it.

01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:18.420
We could teach people to be tracked, controlled, and locked down, and that new variants would

01:43:18.420 --> 01:43:21.780
show up all the time so that the lockdown would never end.

01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:23.060
It's just making that shit up.

01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:24.500
It's just making that shit up.

01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:25.000
Yep.

01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:26.500
So yeah, I don't know.

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.460
Disease X actually has adamantium claws as well.

01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:29.780
True.

01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:30.260
Yeah.

01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:36.820
In 20 years, we'll look back and be like, wow, I can't believe that this was okay.

01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:37.380
Yeah.

01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:38.820
This guy got away with this shit.

01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:40.980
That's my prediction.

01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:41.220
Yeah.

01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:47.700
So if you want to look at what he's saying now and sort of think about like, okay, you

01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:49.620
think that you're going to be proven right about everything.

01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:50.420
Sure.

01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:51.620
Here's the kind of shit he's saying.

01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:54.180
This is an exact plan.

01:43:56.900 --> 01:44:01.140
They teach in elementary school in Germany, we played the actual training videos, that

01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:05.540
when you're seven years old, you should be prepared to marry a Muslim by 14.

01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:10.180
You should be dating a Muslim by 10, and that Muslims will be the future of Europe and that

01:44:10.180 --> 01:44:11.220
Christianity is bad.

01:44:11.220 --> 01:44:12.820
I can show you those newscasts if you like.

01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:15.860
I would like to see those newscasts.

01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:17.140
I would like to see those.

01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:18.020
Don't think you can.

01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:21.220
That would be a very funny video to share on the internet.

01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:26.500
Where the Germans are teaching elementary school kids, hey, you're behind if you're

01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:28.420
not dating a Muslim by fourth grade.

01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:30.980
Hey, 11 year old, what are you doing single?

01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:33.140
You old maid.

01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:34.180
You old maid.

01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:36.500
You'll never get married at this rate.

01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:39.620
You're in sixth grade.

01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:42.260
You should just get some cats.

01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:42.580
Yeah.

01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:45.620
And I see that as somebody who has a cat and I love my cat and there's nothing wrong with

01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:46.340
having cats.

01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:46.500
Yeah.

01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:52.420
Yeah, this is the kind of shit that Alex says, horribly bigoted nonsense.

01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:53.140
Yeah.

01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:57.140
Anyway, the globalists, as we know, 10 years behind.

01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:58.900
Yes, always.

01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:00.660
It might just be a few years behind now.

01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:02.180
What about plan B?

01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:06.500
Plan B, Alex never said that stuff.

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.060
Oh, okay.

01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:07.700
Didn't happen.

01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:08.200
Okay.

01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:10.340
They're behind.

01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:12.420
Listen to this.

01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:14.180
I have a lot of thoughts on the other side of this.

01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:14.740
All right.

01:45:14.740 --> 01:45:15.620
And here's the deal.

01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:21.060
They were supposed to have the whole internet shut down with independent media like us before

01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:21.540
they did this.

01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:23.700
They weren't planning to launch this for a couple of years.

01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:25.700
They launched this early because they're behind schedules.

01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:27.620
They thought they'd catch up by launching early.

01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:28.900
What?

01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:29.860
Some future plans.

01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:30.980
What?

01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:33.940
But all these different globalists know that everyone hates them now.

01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:35.860
I mean, Bill Gates is the most hated man on earth.

01:45:35.860 --> 01:45:36.900
Then it's Klaus Schwab.

01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:37.700
Then it's Macron.

01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:42.420
Then it's the British prime minister that turned out to be a total traitor, Boris Johnson.

01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:43.140
Oof.

01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:45.700
So he's talking about the releasing of COVID.

01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:46.020
Yeah.

01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:47.220
Release the COVID.

01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:48.420
He actually even says that.

01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:49.460
Release the COVID.

01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:55.940
But the idea that he's putting forth is that the globalists were a few years behind.

01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:56.260
Right.

01:45:56.260 --> 01:45:58.660
And so they had to pick up some time.

01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:03.300
Super evil worldwide organization that has orchestrated everything.

01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:03.620
Right.

01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:04.660
Still a few years behind.

01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:04.980
Right.

01:46:04.980 --> 01:46:07.940
And this is a plan that goes back to the devil.

01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:08.180
Yes.

01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:09.460
And the beginning of history.

01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:09.940
Yes.

01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:11.060
Thousands of years back.

01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:14.180
I do appreciate that the devil cannot keep a timetable.

01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:14.420
Right.

01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:16.020
Just behind a little bit.

01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:16.900
Just behind.

01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:17.460
He's the devil.

01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:18.420
What, is he going to work hard?

01:46:18.420 --> 01:46:19.940
I mean, in the song, he's behind.

01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.860
That's why he got kicked out of heaven.

01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:23.060
That's why he went to Georgia.

01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:24.660
Too lazy.

01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:26.260
They have a real slow pace down there.

01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:26.980
He's way behind.

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:27.300
Yeah.

01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:28.100
Looking to make a deal.

01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:39.060
So this plan that is millennia old and has to do with Trump staying in office or something.

01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:39.700
Sure.

01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:40.980
They're behind on it.

01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:41.540
Yeah.

01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:43.300
They're behind on this evil plan.

01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:46.900
And so they decide to release COVID a couple of years early.

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:47.300
Sure.

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:49.540
A couple of years early because they got to make up that time.

01:46:49.540 --> 01:46:51.060
What's the point of having a plan?

01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:52.740
What's the point of a few years?

01:46:54.260 --> 01:46:59.220
Honestly, if you have a millennia old plan and you're only a few years off,

01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:02.180
6,000 years later or whatever, that's really efficient.

01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:04.020
No one's going to remember that.

01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:05.460
That's really efficient.

01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:09.940
Yeah, a few years in this scale of time is meaningless.

01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:10.580
Yeah.

01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:12.100
You're at a work project.

01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:14.420
It's supposed to last a year and you're three months behind.

01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:16.260
People are furious at you.

01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:16.660
Right.

01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:16.900
Yeah.

01:47:16.900 --> 01:47:20.900
So they release COVID a couple of years early to pick up some time.

01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:21.380
Sure.

01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:22.180
Seems dumb.

01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:22.660
Sure.

01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:23.540
Seems stupid.

01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:27.700
Hey guys, we're not ready yet for this plan that's going to end the world.

01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:29.140
I figure we just go for it.

01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:29.780
Yeah, why not?

01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:31.140
Yeah, we got a 50-50 shot.

01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:33.940
So now the problem is that Alex is still on air.

01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:38.980
They were meant to have the internet cracked down by the time that they released this thing.

01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:39.620
Right.

01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:39.860
So...

01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:43.860
So why didn't they?

01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:44.180
Yeah!

01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:46.420
I didn't get a reason for why they did.

01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:47.380
That's my problem.

01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:48.580
Why are they behind?

01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:49.780
Why didn't they shut down?

01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:52.020
Can they not?

01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:55.380
So the goal and the motivation is to make up some lost time.

01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:55.860
Right.

01:47:55.860 --> 01:48:01.060
But the plan that they're engaging in requires that the internet be shut down

01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:02.500
to be pulled off successfully.

01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:02.900
Correct.

01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:05.780
So why would they do this thing to catch up on time

01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:08.900
that they don't have one of the essential pieces in place for?

01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:09.380
Right.

01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:10.660
So dumb.

01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:12.260
Okay, so here's our plan.

01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:18.740
It can only be stopped if we allow independent media to reveal our plans and stop everything.

01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:19.140
Right.

01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:21.700
That, by the way, I'm glad we're having this meeting.

01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:21.860
Yeah.

01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:26.100
That is a crucial first step in terms of us being able to pull off this nefarious plan.

01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:29.540
I would argue it's the only step we can take.

01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:32.740
If we wanted to go early, it would only be that one.

01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:34.100
I'm glad we're all on the same page.

01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:34.420
Yes.

01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:34.820
Yeah.

01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:35.940
So release the COVID.

01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:41.860
Alex will destroy our plans.

01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:42.260
Yeah.

01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:42.900
Certainly.

01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:46.820
And we will not only not make up time, we will lose time.

01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:47.620
We will be set back.

01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:49.220
We'll lose forever.

01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:53.780
We'll be set back to devil times.

01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:54.180
Yeah.

01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:55.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:58.740
Our plan will have to go, we're gonna have to do a page one rewrite on this evil plan.

01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:03.300
Yeah. John of Patnos is about to marvel at our great beast and then he's just gonna go

01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:05.380
back in and the seals are gonna close again.

01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:07.940
Cause we forgot to shut down the internet.

01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:08.420
Fuck.

01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:08.900
Damn it.

01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:10.260
You know what?

01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:11.060
This is on us.

01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:11.300
Yeah.

01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:15.540
We can't claim ignorance on this one.

01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:18.020
We knew that Alex was gonna fuck us up.

01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:21.380
We do like that there are exit interviews for the higher echelons.

01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:21.620
Oh shit.

01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:23.540
Just like, sorry guys, this one's on me.

01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:23.940
Yeah.

01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:24.820
This one's my bad.

01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:26.580
I'll take credit for it.

01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:31.700
So anyway, this is just catalog this in the Alex's plans of the globalists make no sense.

01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:32.260
Yeah.

01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:32.580
Yeah.

01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:34.100
They're real bad at what they do.

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:34.740
They're real bad.

01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:34.980
Yeah.

01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:36.420
It's almost like he's making it all up.

01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:41.700
So, um, one of the things that got everyone really excited over the weekend was there

01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:47.700
was a piece in the wall street journal about Alex being involved in the funding of the,

01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:48.100
uh,

01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:50.260
Stop the steal January 6th.

01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:50.740
Yes.

01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:51.060
Yeah.

01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:51.620
Yes.

01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:57.780
And I read that article and I don't think, uh, that Alex comes off looking that terrible.

01:49:57.780 --> 01:50:02.100
I mean, it's just, you know, organizing and fundraising and stuff.

01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:05.380
I think Ali Alexander obviously looks like way more of a creep.

01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:06.500
That's kind of cause he is.

01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:06.740
Yeah.

01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:08.180
He's a real dangerous lunatic.

01:50:08.180 --> 01:50:08.820
Uh huh.

01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:10.020
Um, but

01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:13.380
Somebody should give him a radio show and then maybe the profit incentive will keep

01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:15.140
him from being too much of an asshole.

01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:15.700
Possibly.

01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:16.340
Yeah.

01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:21.380
Um, Alex responds to this piece on the wall street journal and I think he responds

01:50:21.380 --> 01:50:23.140
exactly how I did.

01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:26.260
And that is, I said all of that stuff on air.

01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:26.500
Yeah.

01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:30.900
So there's hundreds of articles, TV shows, all breathlessly.

01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:41.860
All breathlessly saying, Oh, January 6th rally funded by top Trump donor helped by

01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:43.700
Alex Jones organizers say.

01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:48.020
And it's word for word.

01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:51.380
What I said, day one, Trump wanted to rally the six.

01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:52.900
Nobody would step up with the money.

01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:59.140
I stepped up, put 80 something thousand dollars down to try to secure the venues.

01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:02.420
Cause you got a park service won't even let you authorize the permit unless you show

01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:05.460
you're going to have security and porta potties and all the stuff.

01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:09.700
And then a well-known donor heard I was doing it in contact and I was handing them

01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:12.820
over to her big Republican fundraisers and to them.

01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:19.780
And they tried to turn that into a big conspiracy that I was planning to try to do

01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:24.260
all of this so that we could storm the Capitol.

01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:27.140
From my perspective, I think Alex is kind of right.

01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:27.460
Yeah.

01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:30.420
But I think that this reveals a couple of really funny things.

01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:35.940
Um, first of all, like just the, the idea that he's like, why are they, I, I said

01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:37.540
this and he did.

01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:37.780
Yep.

01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:42.580
He's constantly said a lot of the stuff that's in that wall street journal article

01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:46.660
and the sort of revelations of it are things that you would know if you listen

01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:47.300
to info wars.

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:47.700
Yeah.

01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:54.340
Now, the thing that I think is really funny is like, let's say January 8th, Alex

01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:58.660
has been talking about this and that he had paid for part of this rally.

01:51:58.660 --> 01:51:59.140
There's that.

01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:03.460
The wall street journal would never report on that cause it's just Alex saying it.

01:52:03.460 --> 01:52:03.620
Yeah.

01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:06.020
That's fair.

01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:06.500
Yeah.

01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:07.540
That is fair.

01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:09.140
Alex is an unreliable witness.

01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:10.980
I can't believe anything this guy says.

01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:11.300
Yeah.

01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:15.460
Our source is Alex Jones and it's about Alex Jones and I don't believe a word of

01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:15.620
it.

01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:16.100
Of course.

01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:23.140
So there's a story in the wall street journal now cause someone else said it.

01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:24.100
I don't know.

01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:28.820
I think that would almost be something that Alex should be called as a witness

01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:30.420
at Trump's impeachment trial.

01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:31.860
He thinks he's going to be.

01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:36.180
I mean, he did just say that Trump told him, you know, I didn't have a hard time.

01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:40.660
He's putting himself in the center of that impeachment trial too because of this

01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:42.100
wall street journal piece.

01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:45.460
And, but he's also saying like, they'll never call me as a witness because I

01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:46.740
tried to stop the storming.

01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:48.340
Oh, I'll call him as a witness.

01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:51.700
I'll call you as a witness any day of the week, buddy.

01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:53.060
I want to get you in that stand.

01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:53.780
Oh, it'd be fun.

01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:59.300
Only way to make the impeachment trial more ludicrous would be to invite Alex

01:52:59.300 --> 01:52:59.620
Jones.

01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:02.180
Alex, can I remind you you're under oath?

01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:04.340
I don't even know what that means.

01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:04.580
Yeah.

01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:08.420
So I think it's really funny that the, like a lot of the underlying information

01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:15.060
of this article is stuff that was public prior, but also maybe bullshit.

01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:16.660
Not proven, not proven.

01:53:16.660 --> 01:53:17.780
Yeah, it's not proven.

01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:24.740
And so the second thing that I think is really funny is that the article says,

01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:29.620
quote, Mr. Jones personally pledged more than $50,000 in seed money for a planned

01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:34.260
January 6th event in exchange for a guaranteed top speaking slot of his

01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:38.900
choice according to a funding document outlining a deal between the company,

01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:41.220
his company, and an early organizer for the event.

01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:42.820
So Alex was doing pay to play.

01:53:42.820 --> 01:53:43.300
Of course.

01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:46.820
He was putting down money in order to get a speaking slot.

01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:47.300
Yep.

01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:48.820
That's wild.

01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:50.260
That's kind of embarrassing.

01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:51.060
That's sad.

01:53:51.060 --> 01:53:55.380
In the article, it seems like that's him paying for access.

01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:56.100
Yeah.

01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:58.660
Yeah, there's clout and there's money and you don't have clout.

01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:03.700
And there was no way that Alex was going to get a speaking slot at Trump's

01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:04.420
actual event.

01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:05.460
No, good God, no.

01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:09.220
So, I mean, I figure he did speak the night before.

01:54:09.220 --> 01:54:10.580
That might've been what he paid for.

01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:13.380
Wow.

01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:13.860
Yeah.

01:54:13.860 --> 01:54:17.540
Kind of a bummer, but I do think that those two things in the Wall Street

01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:19.380
Journal article are pretty funny.

01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:23.540
The unreliability of Alex to even speak about his own life and the fact that he

01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:25.060
has to pay to get a speaking slot.

01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:30.980
It is weird how you can both fall so far and yet at the same time inspire a

01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:33.220
literal overthrowing of a country.

01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:33.860
It is.

01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:37.540
That's an interesting up and down kind of scenario there.

01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:38.420
It is interesting.

01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:38.980
Yeah.

01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:45.060
So we end this episode now, Jordan, with evidence of why Alex should never

01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:51.220
have to pay to speak somewhere as long as he's forced to speak over a certain

01:54:51.220 --> 01:55:05.460
song.

01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:09.140
You can face it.

01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:13.780
I understand powerful men.

01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:18.340
Most of them never do anything in their lives because they're ashamed of their

01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:18.660
power.

01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:21.540
They don't want to force their way to the front.

01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:22.420
They're humble.

01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:23.700
They love their family.

01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:25.300
They love their friends.

01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:26.180
They love their community.

01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:28.580
And so they defer to others.

01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:31.060
You can't do that.

01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:34.420
You belong in charge.

01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:39.620
You belong in charge of your life, your family, your destiny.

01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:44.340
And if you don't take control, this evil corrupt system that's laughing at us

01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:50.020
will I call on men to start acting like men.

01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:56.660
I call on men to follow the basic code God wrote on your soul and to stop

01:55:56.660 --> 01:56:00.660
following with fallen men that put out because they're not following God.

01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:02.900
They are falling the fallen one.

01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:05.460
All right.

01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:08.420
You know, I didn't just have all these articles and all these video clips.

01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:10.020
Yes, you did.

01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:12.740
Yes, you absolutely did.

01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:15.060
That's why that's why you would say that.

01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:15.460
Of course.

01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:22.180
That was not the best work he's done over that song, but pretty okay.

01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:25.220
There were moments of the flickering passion.

01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:29.780
I would listen to a cover album of him sing talking what he thinks the lyrics

01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:30.740
to songs are.

01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:32.340
I don't want him to do that.

01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:34.900
Although I do think that would be interesting as a side project.

01:56:34.900 --> 01:56:38.580
I want an album of just that song, 12 tracks.

01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:39.060
Yeah.

01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:40.580
Just that song.

01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:45.620
But different days, Alex, just Alex's greatest hits, freestyling.

01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:47.620
Yes, whatever is on his mind.

01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:52.740
This is like a great thesis at the beginning of this.

01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:54.820
I know about powerful men.

01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:55.620
Go from there.

01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:56.100
Go for it.

01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:56.740
Just see what happens.

01:56:56.740 --> 01:56:57.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:56:57.540 --> 01:56:58.100
Just write it.

01:56:58.100 --> 01:56:59.940
You love that goddamn saxophone.

01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:00.820
Everybody loves that.

01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.580
I'm talking about Alex.

01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:03.620
He loves that saxophone.

01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:04.420
Oh, he does.

01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:06.020
It does something to him.

01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:06.980
It does something to me.

01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:07.460
Yeah.

01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:08.660
We were both dancing.

01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:10.740
We did, I didn't hear much of what he said.

01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:12.180
I was too busy singing along.

01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:13.780
That is a sultry ass song.

01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:16.900
It is a great track.

01:57:16.900 --> 01:57:18.340
It's a banger of a track.

01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:21.300
I mean, it's no Zamfir, the lonely shepherd.

01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:29.460
But yeah, it clearly puts Alex into some kind of a zone where it's like, it's time to blow

01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:29.780
hard.

01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:30.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:31.540
It's time to be...

01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:34.180
No narratives right now.

01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:39.940
I'm just going with straight, inspirational fucking clear eyes, full hearts, belong to

01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:40.340
the city.

01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:41.700
I can see the horizon.

01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:42.740
Yeah, 100%.

01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:44.260
Absolutely.

01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:48.580
Alex talks a bunch about being able to kick himself into a psychic state, and I don't

01:57:48.580 --> 01:57:49.220
believe that.

01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:51.220
But that song kicks him into something.

01:57:51.220 --> 01:57:51.620
Something.

01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:52.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:57:52.660 --> 01:57:58.420
So we come to the end of this exploration, Jordan, and I'm left with sort of a bad taste

01:57:58.420 --> 01:58:02.260
in my mouth for Alex and his January 6th narratives.

01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:07.380
I think it'll be interesting to see, as we get closer to the impeachment, how Alex keeps

01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:12.980
probably trying to egg Trump into turning it into some kind of a circus.

01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:13.380
Yeah.

01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:18.340
And what ends up happening with that will be fascinating to watch Alex deal with.

01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:22.660
But I do worry about his malleability.

01:58:23.780 --> 01:58:31.060
The fact that he can have these people, the Boogaloos, that he decided were a FBI cutout

01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:37.300
group, and he said he'd proved all this, and then have two of them on to manipulate him

01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:39.220
and embarrass him in different ways.

01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:40.340
So easy.

01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:42.980
It's just, it's a mess.

01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:43.480
Yeah.

01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:46.180
Yeah, I imagine that this is...

01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:54.500
I think what scares me most about this is how easily they are hand-waving away what

01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:58.260
even Alex was like, this is going to fuck everything up.

01:58:58.260 --> 01:59:01.860
You know, like, Alex is, I got to back away from this.

01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:04.980
This is all, this, I know this is bad for me.

01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:10.340
I know that this January 6th takeover of the fucking country is bad for me.

01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:10.820
Yeah.

01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:14.820
And it takes two weeks for people to convince me that, eh, you guys are great.

01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:17.460
Yeah, that's not good.

01:59:17.460 --> 01:59:19.940
Well, no, because he's trying to have it both ways too.

01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:25.060
He's trying to retain that this was bad, but also like all of the actors who were actually

01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:29.940
involved in it aren't bad, there were just a few people in their organizations who were

01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:32.900
secret globalists who were trying to make them look bad.

01:59:32.900 --> 01:59:34.660
It's too complicated.

01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:39.540
No, he's still trying to run interference for people who are going to do what he wants

01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:40.260
them to do.

01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:45.780
Yeah, in the same way that Stuart Rhodes is gonna still fundraise for his Oathkeeper folks

01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:53.220
who stormed the Capitol, Alex is making it very clear that if you kiss the ring, sort

01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:59.780
of, or if you'll play ball a little bit, I will pretend that all the members of your

01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:03.460
group who do bad things are not really part of your group.

02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:04.020
Yeah.

02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:05.140
Yeah, exactly.

02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:07.220
And that's stupid.

02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:08.100
That's fucked up.

02:00:08.100 --> 02:00:08.500
Yep.

02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:08.820
Yep.

02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:09.940
But expected.

02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:10.740
100%.

02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:14.340
Anyway, sorry the episode's late, we'll be back with another episode at the end of the

02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:14.660
week.

02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:15.060
Indeed.

02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:16.420
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

02:00:16.420 --> 02:00:18.100
We do have a website, it's knowledgefight.com.

02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:19.780
Yep, we're also on Twitter.

02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:22.900
We are also on Twitter, it's at knowledgefight.net, go to bed Jordan.

02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:26.260
Yeah, we'll be on Facebook in the future.

02:00:26.260 --> 02:00:28.020
We'll be on Facebook someday.

02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:28.520
Yeah.

02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:33.620
But iTunes, if you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area.

02:00:33.620 --> 02:00:34.260
Yeah, we'll be back.

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:39.460
But until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZXClark, I'm Daryl Rundis, I'm the Juiciest Dice

02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:39.940
Cube.

02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:42.500
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:47.700
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work.

02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:56.980
I love you.
