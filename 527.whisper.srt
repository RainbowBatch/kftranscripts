Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,200
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,360
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,880
Thanks for holding us.

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,120
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller.

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,720
I'm a huge fan, I love your word.

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,820
Knowledgefight, n-n-n-n-n-Knowledgefight.com I love you.

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:26,820
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight. I'm Dan. I'm Jordan. We're a couple dudes that like to sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones. Oh, indeed we are, Dan. Jordan. Dan! What's up? Quick question for you. Yeah. What's your bright spot today? My bright spot today, Jordan, comes in the form of a cereal. I decided that, okay, so I was making some choices on cereal, right? I'm sitting there looking at these boxes. Yeah. And I see one that is a Dunkin' Donuts flavor. No. Mocha. No. Mocha. No. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha.

16
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,620
Coffee refuse cereal. Pass. Hard pass. I stared at it. I throw a spear at that box. I stared at it

17
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:40,100
for a while because it was like, well, I'm drawn in. But there's another voice that was telling me,

18
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,860
is this the novelty that's going to get you burned? Right. Is this too novel? Right. Right.

19
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,820
Right. Honestly, there was also one, there was a Carmel Macchiato and I said, that looks gross.

20
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,420
That is definitely going to burn me. I do appreciate finding where your limits are.

21
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,220
It's right between those two. Exactly. We found that certain perfect gray zone.

22
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:09,300
Carmel Macchiato is too far. That's the Mendoza line, as they say. Yes, absolutely.

23
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:16,900
Shout out to Marty. Yeah. I got it. It's great. It's really good. It's great. Of course it is.

24
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,500
It's shockingly good. What does it taste like, a donut? No, it tastes like coffee.

25
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,860
It tastes like coffee. It tastes like a mocha coffee. Oh, I thought they were going to taste

26
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:30,260
like a donut type thing. No, and it's got like, basically the texture of it is there's like little

27
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:36,020
marshmallows and then the cereal itself is basically just like Cocoa Puffs. Oh, okay.

28
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:42,180
It's just, I don't know. I mean, it's not good. It's not good for you. It's not great. It's just,

29
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,300
I expected it to be a real dangerous proposition. It turned out to be great. I enjoyed it. I

30
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,740
recommend it. I imagine Dunkin Donuts probably won't release a cereal based on my coffee flavor,

31
00:02:52,740 --> 00:03:01,860
which is black. Just a burnt flavored. Yeah, burnt, black, a whole pot of it too.

32
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,500
Yeah, a post is going to come out with a Folgers.

33
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,660
No cream. I don't foresee that happening. Are you sick of drinking coffee? Chew it!

34
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,220
This introduces an actual interesting problem. What's that? That is that if you have a black

35
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,700
coffee flavored cereal, do you have milk in it? What do I drink with it? Yes.

36
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,660
Do you put milk in or is that ruined? I do not. You can't. It ruins the cereal.

37
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,740
So do you pour coffee in there? Absolutely.

38
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,940
Okay. What else would you drink? Double brewed.

39
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,820
Silly. Yes. That's a red eye.

40
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,860
Yeah. That sounds right.

41
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,780
So what about you? What's your bright spot? My bright spot, Dan, is the new album by Madlib,

42
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,820
Sound Ancestors. Very, very good. Okay.

43
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,740
Very, very good. It's all music that was made by Madlib over the span of

44
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,980
like the past two years. You know Madlib, right? Yeah.

45
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,300
You know how all he does is just sit around and make music all the time?

46
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,780
I got that sense. Yeah. I mean, I don't know him personally, but yeah, it seems like he likes music.

47
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,860
He's one of my heroes just because he's like one of those guys who's just like,

48
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,340
I know what I do and I make music and everything else can go fuck off.

49
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,540
Yeah. That's basically like me and looking at Alex Jones.

50
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,540
And you see now why I'm drawn to you and people of your ilk.

51
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,060
Weird committed people. Yes.

52
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,540
Absolutely. Because I'm a little lazy.

53
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,460
You're fine. Anyways, it was arranged by Fortet and it's really, really,

54
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,220
really, really good. I love it so much. Awesome.

55
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,260
Yeah. Absolutely.

56
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,580
I'll have to give that a spin. I've been getting back on the bike a little bit and

57
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,740
I've been needing some more music to throw into the rotation.

58
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,380
Toss it in there. I've been listening to a lot of Polish Ambassador.

59
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,980
Okay. Well. I enjoy the Polish Ambassador.

60
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,900
It will be a departure of style. I will say that.

61
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,860
Maybe less than you think.

62
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,300
I don't know. We'll see.

63
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,140
Have you ever heard of the Polish Ambassador?

64
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,980
I have heard of him. I haven't listened to that in a while.

65
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,300
I enjoy, there's an album called, I don't even remember.

66
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,580
How old is that again?

67
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,220
Huh?

68
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,420
What album are you talking about?

69
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,220
Let me actually pull it up here because I forget names of things really easily.

70
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,740
You know, it's like within the last five years or so, some of these albums.

71
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:27,780
The one I was listening to is him and Ayla Nerio. She's a singer, like a vocalist.

72
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,100
They have a group called Wild Light and they have an album called The Tide that

73
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,020
I was listening to that's really, it's good for, you know, a little bit of riding the bike,

74
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,660
cardio stuff, but I'll check out that Madlib album too.

75
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,140
I'll check it out.

76
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,420
Because otherwise I'm just going to end up drifting back to Carly Rae Jepsen.

77
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:42,900
Yeah, yeah.

78
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,980
Look, there's nothing wrong with mixing in a little bit of that.

79
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,180
But if you start riding your bike and listening to Ska,

80
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,460
I'm never going to hear the end of it.

81
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,820
It's going to be trouble.

82
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:56,260
I generally, if I have that feeling, I only listen to the Sami Zayn intro music,

83
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,060
because that's great.

84
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,140
And then also Christian Ska, like Five Iron Frenzy or the OC Supertones.

85
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,740
Because those have like a sentimental thing to them too.

86
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,740
I will rarely ever listen to other Ska stuff on the bike.

87
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,940
If you listen to Christian Ska backwards, is that like running away from God?

88
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,620
Or how does that work?

89
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,020
Sure.

90
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,340
Yeah?

91
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:18,660
Yeah.

92
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:18,900
Okay.

93
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,540
I'll give it to you.

94
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,020
Okay, fair.

95
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,260
So Jordan, today we have an interesting episode to go over.

96
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,100
We're going to be talking about February 4th, 2021.

97
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,500
Blackjack!

98
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:24,820
Blackjack!

99
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,940
Oh, damn it!

100
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,340
So close.

101
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,420
I was ready for it too.

102
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,380
I was ready for it.

103
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,260
I'm so lazy.

104
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,740
Got some interesting stuff happening on this episode that requires our attention.

105
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,540
Uh, this is Thursday's episode, so, you know, it's right hot off the presses.

106
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,420
Yes, indeed.

107
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,660
And I had an interesting ride to get here.

108
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,140
And we'll talk about that as we start the episode.

109
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,180
But first, let's give a little bit of a shout out to the folks who have signed up and are

110
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,140
supporting the show.

111
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,060
So first, Villain Jack, thank you so much.

112
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,500
You are now a policy wonk.

113
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,540
I'm a policy wonk.

114
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,580
Thanks, Villain Jack!

115
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,060
Thank you.

116
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,500
Next, Long Winded, thank you so much.

117
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,860
You are now a policy wonk.

118
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,980
I'm a policy wonk.

119
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,020
Thank you very much.

120
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,820
Long Winded.

121
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,020
I feel a spiritual connection with anybody whose alias is named Long Winded.

122
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,140
Since I've been accused of being someone who uses about 15 times the words they need.

123
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,820
No, you're an orator, sir.

124
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,380
You're not Long Winded.

125
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,820
That's a polite way of saying it.

126
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,780
Next, I Guess Murder Hornets Were Just a Filler episode.

127
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,140
You are now a policy wonk.

128
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,420
I'm a policy wonk.

129
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:20,900
That's a good point.

130
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,020
Thank you very much, yeah.

131
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,100
Next, I'm Camry and I submit to the globalists.

132
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,580
Thank you so much.

133
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,620
You are now a policy wonk.

134
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,740
I'm a policy wonk.

135
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,940
Thank you very much, Camry!

136
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,860
Next, Shmoo is Q.

137
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,420
Thank you so much.

138
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,780
You are now a policy wonk.

139
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,740
I'm a policy wonk.

140
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,620
We've solved the mystery.

141
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,420
We figured it out.

142
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,220
It's Shmoo.

143
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,940
Then finally, let's say thank you to a couple of people who donated on elevated level.

144
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,980
We appreciate that very much.

145
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,220
So first is a sandwich, all one word.

146
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:41,700
Thank you so much.

147
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,900
You're now a technocrat.

148
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,740
And take my money, you filthy animals.

149
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,300
Thank you so much.

150
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,740
You are now a technocrat.

151
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,020
I'm a policy wonk.

152
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,740
Crikey, mate.

153
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,700
That's fantastic.

154
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,060
Have yourself a brew.

155
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,660
How's your 401k doing, bro?

156
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,300
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

157
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,500
Let's just get down to business.

158
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,580
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

159
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,940
Why are you pimps so good?

160
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,260
My neck is freakishly large.

161
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,820
I declare info war on you.

162
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,340
Thank you all so much.

163
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:06,900
Yes, thank you very much.

164
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,260
I like the is a sandwich name, too, because I've gotten into some aggressive arguments

165
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,300
in my time about whether things are or are not sandwiches.

166
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,620
Yeah, I've heard of people doing that.

167
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,420
And it disconcerts me that people would have strong feelings about sandwiches.

168
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:29,140
Well, it really introduces a philosophical question about what does constitute a sandwich.

169
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,540
Right.

170
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,620
Hot dog is a classic thing that will cause people to come to loggerheads.

171
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,340
Sure, it is a divisive topic.

172
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,820
But once you start talking about that, you enter the world of taco.

173
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,700
Is a taco a sandwich?

174
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,340
Oh, my God.

175
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:42,740
I know.

176
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,540
See, that's what I'm saying.

177
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,180
Oh, no.

178
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,500
Once you start getting into that, it's dangerous.

179
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,460
It's a slippery slope.

180
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:55,700
I only trust the word of the Earl himself, and he has not spoken regarding hot dogs.

181
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,180
So I say that it's fine or it's not fine.

182
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,180
It does not matter until he speaks.

183
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,180
All right, well, we will go with that.

184
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,660
Yeah.

185
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,340
So, Jordan, today, this episode, like I said, we're doing February 4th.

186
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:15,140
And my path to this was a challenge because I was trying to get myself really motivated

187
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,740
to talk about Alex on Monday.

188
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,700
From Monday, we're going to cover the week.

189
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,620
And then he started talking like this.

190
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,660
I can't handle it.

191
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,620
I just can't handle it.

192
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,380
And it's global government and China's open for business.

193
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:42,660
It's designed to transfer all of the all of the resources and jobs overseas.

194
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,620
And the public's got to go into a conscious mode.

195
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,700
Everybody gets really unconscious, just kind of accepts what's coming at them.

196
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,660
Like, I'm not mad at the crew.

197
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,180
I love them to death.

198
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:57,300
But I said, if my call was ever sticking up, you got to tell me on air, open your eyes,

199
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,580
look for problems.

200
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,180
I got a booger hanging out of my nose.

201
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,580
Tell me.

202
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,220
But they won't do it.

203
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,020
They're good people.

204
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,380
They're just in a trance.

205
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,060
Eye collar was sticking straight up.

206
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,100
See, I'm not mad at them.

207
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,980
It's a teaching moment.

208
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,540
The globalists are coming with deadly vaccines that don't work.

209
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,580
Permanent lockdowns.

210
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,100
Everybody's just kind of taking it.

211
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,540
They're just kind of taking it.

212
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,420
Can't take it anymore.

213
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,940
You got to get the conscious mode.

214
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,940
See, when you're not conscious, you're basically dying.

215
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,900
And your collar's up.

216
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,380
Yeah, I was listening to that.

217
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,100
Wow.

218
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,540
This is so dumb.

219
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,060
Okay.

220
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,580
He's basically having an HR meeting where he's scolding the crew for not telling him

221
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,620
that his collar was up.

222
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,780
But in the guise of talking about how when you're unconscious, the globalist can pull

223
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,100
stuff off.

224
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,620
It does seem like he's turning what is a very petty.

225
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,780
You guys should know I am incapable of basic hygiene.

226
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,180
Yeah.

227
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,220
And take care of me.

228
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,100
Tell them.

229
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,700
Into a global problem.

230
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,540
Talk to your staff during the breaks.

231
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,020
Make your points on air.

232
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,060
I just was listening to that.

233
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,260
Like, this is so stupid.

234
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,220
I can't even.

235
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,700
Wild.

236
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,340
Yeah, it felt like walking through knee deep mud.

237
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,300
Listen to this shit.

238
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,180
I don't need it.

239
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:07,220
And so I decided, you know, like, maybe I'll go and try to find some Project Camelot stuff

240
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,100
to take a break with.

241
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,980
No good.

242
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,620
Not great.

243
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,700
So we decided we're going to do a time travel episode.

244
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,820
Go back to the past.

245
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,060
At our now daily morning meetings.

246
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:21,140
I listened to an episode from 2011, and I found Alex trying to get really excited about

247
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,180
Bilderberg, and it made sense. Everything checked out.

248
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,380
He was really excited about this Swiss Holocaust denier that he didn't realize was a Holocaust

249
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,180
denier.

250
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,060
It was a lot of fun.

251
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,100
We're going to have fun with that.

252
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,620
But then the bat signal went off.

253
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,420
Oh, I know.

254
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,940
Jordan, the bat signal.

255
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,500
I heard.

256
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,580
It's Thursday, February 4th of the year.

257
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,940
It's 2021.

258
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,180
Dr. Steve Pucinek is going to face the music.

259
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,140
We really appreciate him.

260
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,420
He has a lot of courage.

261
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,260
Coming up in hour number two.

262
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,340
Stay with us.

263
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,500
That is catnip.

264
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,020
Yeah, there's nothing we can do.

265
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,520
Nope.

266
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,380
There are certain times in doing this show where you just got to resign yourself to like,

267
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,220
well, here's what happens.

268
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,780
Yep.

269
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:12,100
Steve's back on after saying Trump will still be president after January 20th or I'll eat

270
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,060
my hat, essentially.

271
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,980
If he's not president, then I'll never come on your show again.

272
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,900
If I am, you got to hire me, right?

273
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,020
You know, so no one is happy.

274
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,020
I was interested.

275
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,260
Yes, I too am.

276
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,060
I'm interested to see what kind of big swing is going on here.

277
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:36,260
Steve is a lunatic and yeah, I don't know, man.

278
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,020
You just never know what to expect.

279
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,340
And this I'm hoping for a double down.

280
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:48,020
I'm hoping for him to come right out and say Trump is still president.

281
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,220
Huh?

282
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,500
That would be a swing.

283
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,660
I'm going to say completely unrelated to what you want.

284
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,060
Sure.

285
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,620
Don't take this as a sign whether that is or is not going to happen.

286
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,100
Okay.

287
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,940
I'll say that I was a little underwhelmed by this interview on both of their parts.

288
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,100
I was a little underwhelmed by Alex and by Steve, although there is some hilarious stuff

289
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,900
that happens, but the two of them should have been screaming at each other.

290
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,540
Absolutely.

291
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:17,140
This should have been a knockdown drag out fucking you have been lying to me since the

292
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,300
beginning and then Stevie P has been like, of course I've been lying to you.

293
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,180
You're a moron.

294
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,660
It's nuts that Steve agreed to do it.

295
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,540
Oh, of course he did.

296
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,740
He doesn't give a fuck.

297
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,740
He does not give one fuck.

298
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,100
It's nuts that Alex clearly doesn't have more of a plan.

299
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,420
That is obvious, expected, and still insane.

300
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,300
It's just outrageous.

301
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:37,860
Yeah.

302
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,020
So Alex, that's in the second hour.

303
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,260
He's got to get to some other news in the first hour.

304
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:42,820
Sure.

305
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,860
But see, these are liars.

306
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,020
In a moment, I'm going to show you AOC caught in the lie we talked about a few days ago.

307
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,660
I said, wait a minute, look up where her office is.

308
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,060
She's a junior member of the house.

309
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,900
And I've actually been there while she was a Congresswoman and saw her scurrying around

310
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,660
the halls about a year and a half ago.

311
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,260
She wasn't even in the damn Capitol.

312
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,940
I mean, I mean, I know we talked about a few days ago, but now it's even on Fox news.

313
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,580
This woman is a congenital liar.

314
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,540
We're going to get to that here in a moment.

315
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:19,380
But first, my dad launched a new company about a year and a half ago and developed his own

316
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,500
amazing toothpaste.

317
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,700
Ooh, wild.

318
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,180
Good stuff.

319
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:22,420
Good.

320
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:22,980
All right.

321
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,300
Hey.

322
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,300
She didn't claim to have been in the Capitol building.

323
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,860
That her building itself was also evacuated.

324
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,060
I just, I don't know.

325
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,740
I understand that the right wing really desperately needs to try and minimize the human trauma

326
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,860
that was experienced by the people who were the victims of the consequences of their rhetoric.

327
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,500
Sure.

328
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,140
We tried to get you guys murdered, but you're lying about it.

329
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,380
Yeah.

330
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,380
I understand why people like Candace Owens and Jack Pessobic are really pushing these

331
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:51,940
things hard.

332
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,580
And Alex is now jumping on this as well.

333
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,700
Like, I get it.

334
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,060
It's just dumb.

335
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,060
It's awful to see.

336
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,860
Like, denying her her experiences is just...

337
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,540
Yeah, no, it's one of the more fucked up things I can think of.

338
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:15,540
I, like, if I, from an empathetic position, if I put myself in their shoes, I imagine

339
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,180
I too would scramble because I would not want to reckon with the idea that I am essentially

340
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,300
an attempted murder.

341
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,180
Well, you gotta...

342
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:22,420
You know?

343
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,060
But I don't think that they have, I don't know, I think they're just basically psychopaths

344
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,780
and they're like, well, this is what we got to do to protect the grift, not...

345
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,260
The alternative...

346
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,140
I don't care.

347
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,380
They don't care if she was murdered.

348
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:39,060
I think part of it is protecting the grift, but then also I think a part of it is, you

349
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:44,180
know, it's something that is so essential to a lot of these narratives, is the inability

350
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,140
or the desire not to feel bad about anything.

351
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,100
Yeah, yeah.

352
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,620
And that would penetrate that bubble pretty hard, recognizing that these are human consequences

353
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,060
of these conspiracy theories and this bullshit that gets peddled.

354
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,980
And to recognize that would probably introduce some bad feelings.

355
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,220
Yeah.

356
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,180
And, you know, that's not in their interest.

357
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,220
No, that would hurt.

358
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,540
Yeah.

359
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,580
Yeah, they don't like that.

360
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:15,300
So Alex does that AOC shit and then he flips into an ad and like he does an entire segment

361
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,740
that's just ads.

362
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,140
The entire second segment of the show is ads.

363
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,780
Sure.

364
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,700
And it's just unbelievable.

365
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,540
Buy my dad's toothpaste so I can hide more money in his company.

366
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,260
It's a drag!

367
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,340
It almost feels like Alex thinks that announcing that Steve's gonna be on the show is gonna

368
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:36,260
somehow boost ratings, and then he does an extended commercial to try and get the message

369
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,620
out to as many people as he can.

370
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,120
Could be.

371
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,700
Then he gets back to teasing the Steve interview.

372
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,900
And Dr. Steve Pacinek, we have the clip we'll play it here in a few minutes, has the courage

373
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:52,260
to come back on the show after coming on for 19 years and saying about 95% of what he's

374
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,780
predicted has come true, what he predicted here a month ago before January 20th did not

375
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,420
come true, and he's gonna give us his take on it.

376
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,940
I can't wait to talk to him.

377
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,820
Can't wait.

378
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,380
Can't wait.

379
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:06,980
Man.

380
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,820
But see, here's the thing that I take issue with with a comment like that.

381
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,740
What Alex is doing is he's framing Steve's comments as predictions.

382
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,140
Yeah.

383
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,580
They shouldn't be predictions.

384
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,260
No, he said he proved them.

385
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,780
Yes, Steve's been saying he's involved in things.

386
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,900
He's been saying he did it.

387
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,380
Yeah.

388
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,460
He's not predicting something will happen.

389
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,500
He's doing it.

390
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,540
Yeah, it would be a completely different show, and people wouldn't take it as seriously if

391
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,460
you were just like, hey, I don't know anything.

392
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,020
I'm just getting.

393
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,180
Oh, here's what I think is gonna happen.

394
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,500
No, Steve pretends that he's got, like, teams of intelligence agents in the field.

395
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:40,660
Yeah.

396
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,740
What's the point of having a guy who's an expert with all of his connections if you're

397
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,740
just gonna ask him for random ass predictions?

398
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,220
Yeah.

399
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:53,780
When he says I'm involved in this shit, then your brain is like, oh, he must be talking

400
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,660
about something.

401
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,460
If he just says, I predict this is gonna happen, you can start to recognize, oh, his predictions

402
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,740
have a terrible batting average.

403
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,460
He's not doing well.

404
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,940
I guess I won't take those predictions that seriously anymore.

405
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,820
Might be a bad idea.

406
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:11,300
Yeah, it's experienced completely different to a listener when you present it as like,

407
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,180
I did this.

408
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,060
I put QR codes on all the ballots.

409
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,740
So insane.

410
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,700
Blockchain.

411
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,420
You know what?

412
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:24,660
What I don't understand about Alex is that I feel like he's missing that golden opportunity

413
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:33,860
of, like, when you can cut ties with one of these assholes, it's like getting rid of.

414
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,100
It's like when you're playing Go Fish or Old Maid or whatever it is where you can like,

415
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,620
oh, as I'm discarding this card, I am not losing a card.

416
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,420
I am giving the bad thing away.

417
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,380
You know, like, when you cut ties with the Stevie P's, you can throw so many bloated

418
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,980
narratives on him.

419
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,100
Like, just toss all the shit that you don't want anymore out.

420
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,220
Steve did Sandy Hook.

421
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,420
Exactly.

422
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,260
Be like, no, no, that was all Steve's idea.

423
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,780
Like, go all in.

424
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,620
Land it all on him.

425
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,260
Don't half ass it.

426
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,740
And you wouldn't be lying for the most part.

427
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,500
Steve did influence all these negative things.

428
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,620
Yeah, absolutely.

429
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,500
I don't know.

430
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,660
I think that Steve, because of Alex, has built up his own organic fan base.

431
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,060
And now that is a threat to Alex.

432
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:24,820
But if he turns on Steve too hard, Steve's audience will turn on Alex.

433
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,660
What a goddamn moron.

434
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:26,900
Yep.

435
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,180
They basically are just like pointing guns at each other.

436
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,180
They're just sitting there like, all right, we're at an impasse.

437
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,700
What do we do?

438
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,180
Sir, sir!

439
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,420
Yeah.

440
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,020
And that seems to be a theme of Alex.

441
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,980
Like, he just builds up these no-win situations with these lunatics.

442
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,580
And then here we are.

443
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,900
Is there a man who is more dedicated to hoisting himself upon his own petards?

444
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,420
It seems to work.

445
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,700
I mean, it's profitable.

446
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,580
That's fair.

447
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,260
Also, I forgot about this.

448
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,820
I forgot we need to give a shout out to someone whose birthday it is.

449
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,860
Alexis sent an email and told us that Sean is celebrating a birthday.

450
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,820
Oh, happy birthday, Sean.

451
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,100
And so, Sean, I just wanted to give you a little bit of a happy birthday.

452
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,060
Happy birthday, Sean.

453
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,220
Many more!

454
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,420
Isn't that what they do?

455
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,220
Birthdays?

456
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,100
No, it is not.

457
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,500
Okay.

458
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,860
Nobody wishes you more birthdays than you would die sooner.

459
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,580
No, they don't want you to have no more birthdays.

460
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,420
Yeah, no, they want you to have no more birthdays.

461
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,540
No, they want you to have more.

462
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,420
A ton of them.

463
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,460
But the more birthdays you have, the closer you are to death.

464
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,260
But no, because if you have more, it's further off.

465
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,620
Each one of them represents a year.

466
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,020
Alright, but then you're just saying I want you to race closer and closer to your end.

467
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,940
Jordan, you're literally making no sense.

468
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,380
I'm sorry.

469
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,420
And that's fitting.

470
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:38,740
Okay.

471
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,940
Because neither does Alex.

472
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,440
Fair.

473
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:41,780
He...

474
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,540
Alright, here's the bottom line.

475
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,580
Let's hear the bottom line.

476
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:52,500
Most of the first hour is spent with Alex talking disgustingly and grotesquely about child abuse.

477
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,300
And we're not going to listen to any of that.

478
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,620
Good.

479
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,180
And I have my reasons for it, and if anybody takes issue with that,

480
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,380
I will say that we've covered some of that stuff in the past.

481
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:09,460
It doesn't add anything to demonstrate these things over and over again.

482
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,660
And I believe that the way that Alex carries himself

483
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,420
has the potential to be re-traumatizing to people.

484
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,900
And I don't want to be a part of bringing that to our audience.

485
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,740
And I want no part of it if you think that is an inappropriate decision on my part.

486
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,300
I would encourage you to start your own Alex Jones podcast.

487
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,740
We've had...

488
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,700
How many times has he been on the show saying that shit?

489
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,900
Go back and listen to it.

490
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,260
He's saying the same shit.

491
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:36,740
It happens a lot.

492
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,780
And it's disgusting.

493
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,980
Yeah, it happens a lot.

494
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,340
And this was a particularly grotesque example of it.

495
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,820
And I only have two clips that aren't actually about that,

496
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:52,900
but are about little things that he's saying on the side of those conversations

497
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,060
that are kind of stupid and maybe a little bit interesting.

498
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,900
The first one is about cannibalism.

499
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,420
There are a lot of currencies on the planet that the establishment operates under.

500
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,020
There's cash.

501
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,380
There's digital money.

502
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,820
There's the derivatives.

503
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,940
There's art.

504
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,820
There's drugs.

505
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,340
There's sex.

506
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,380
There's information.

507
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:18,660
And there is all sorts of weird, decadent pleasures.

508
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,380
I mean, a big one is eating dead bodies.

509
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,780
A lot of establishment people really like to eat human flesh.

510
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,260
Sure.

511
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,580
And they get them from morgues and stuff with dead kids and people.

512
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,060
Naturally.

513
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,820
And that's something that's well known.

514
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,780
I've seen Blade.

515
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,460
My dad told me all about this when I was a kid.

516
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,980
Then later I saw it come out on the news.

517
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,060
That's how I know this is nonsense.

518
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,620
Wow.

519
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,100
Yeah.

520
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,780
Whenever you're Alex Jones and you're like,

521
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,580
I'm a big, serious expert on the New World Order.

522
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,900
My dad told me people get eaten.

523
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,260
My dad said one time that a doctor ate a person.

524
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,900
I would say that if you want to be taken seriously, don't say it that way.

525
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,940
Don't.

526
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,540
If you can prove these claims, you don't need to say my dad told me.

527
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:09,380
When I was little, I discovered that while you were sleeping, if you had lost a tooth,

528
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,860
someone will break into your home and brutally rip it from beneath your pillow.

529
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,460
Will they leave something behind?

530
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,580
I don't know, but I read it in the news later on in life.

531
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,300
It's been confirmed.

532
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:19,780
Yeah.

533
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,180
Yeah.

534
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,420
So Alex Jones's dad's scary bedtime story is not withstanding.

535
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,260
Every detail, with the more we learn about his dad, the amount of-

536
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,140
That dude is a fucked up dude.

537
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,140
He fucked up Alex so bad.

538
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,580
He's a fucked up dude.

539
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,300
Yeah.

540
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:45,060
So the other clip that Alex has here is, you know, whenever you, like, people get rich,

541
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,660
they start to need more exciting things.

542
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:54,020
The mundane pleasures of life sometimes are not what they...

543
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,780
You know, they get rid of sports cars, they drive fast.

544
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,460
Yeah, it's an escalation problem.

545
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,740
The moment you've achieved your dream, now you have to find something else to achieve.

546
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,220
Right.

547
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,300
Alex discusses this a little bit, and I should tell you this, this is a family show.

548
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,220
That's the type of stuff going on, where these people have all the money, all the power,

549
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,220
and so they just do more and more degenerate stuff.

550
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:18,100
I mean, it's very popular for establishment folks to just eat big bowls of fresh feces

551
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,460
right out of a woman's rear end.

552
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,500
And, you know, I'm not trying to be gross here, folks.

553
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,980
I just want you to know what we're up against and what we're dealing with.

554
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,540
Okay.

555
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,340
All right, Alex.

556
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:40,900
Okay, sure, fine, I don't know.

557
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,660
Okay, so what do you...

558
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,380
Here's what I saw.

559
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,900
I saw Nancy Pelosi sitting at a desk much like ours, right?

560
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,620
Like, you're fairly close to me.

561
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,220
If you were to stand up, turn around, and just start shitting into a bowl,

562
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,980
I could grab a spoon and just eat as you shit out of it.

563
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,900
That's what I saw Nancy Pelosi doing.

564
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,940
Is that what you...

565
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,180
I didn't have any mental image except for Alex,

566
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,460
just like his brain trying to be like, what can I say that's gross?

567
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,500
Yeah, exactly.

568
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:16,740
Like, I mean, look, humans are not good eating from a nutritional standpoint.

569
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,140
It doesn't make sense for people to eat humans.

570
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,780
No.

571
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,780
And there's also nutritional issues with eating feces.

572
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,580
I mean, both are great for just purely pleasurable things.

573
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,620
It's like, no, no, no, sometimes I order Chinese food,

574
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,580
and I know it's not maybe the most healthy decision,

575
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,140
but it's about the pleasure of eating it, Dan.

576
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,860
I imagine the same thing is true for eating shit coming out of a woman.

577
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,700
That seems like a good way to get oral fecal transmitted conditions.

578
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,980
Yeah, for the pleasure of it.

579
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:52,180
Or, I mean, eating humans, there's a lot of conditions you can come down from with that.

580
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,100
Well, they wash them first.

581
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,980
Ah, okay, fine.

582
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,740
Anyway, this is all stupid.

583
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,740
Alex gets around to the Steve interview,

584
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,740
and he's sort of easing into the introduction.

585
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,340
Coming to you live from the ATX, broadcasting worldwide.

586
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:15,140
I'm not going to try to rehabilitate Dr. Steve Pachinnik here on air in some people's eyes,

587
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:20,020
but he did leave the CFR and say 9-11 was an inside job and called the real perpetrators out

588
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,420
that were actually involved orchestrating it.

589
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,100
I'm not saying radical Islam doesn't exist.

590
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,940
And he's done a lot of other good things.

591
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,980
Wasn't for the Syrian war, supported Trump, trying to get troops out.

592
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,220
But I thought he was buying into the whole Q8-chan deal.

593
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,540
Here is a problem for me.

594
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,220
If you believe that he's an expert inside person,

595
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,300
he should not be at all persuaded by Q stuff.

596
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,300
If you have for a moment the inclination to think that Steve Pachinnik

597
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,100
is getting influenced by stuff on a message board,

598
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,380
you should very seriously question whether or not you should take anything he's saying seriously.

599
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,180
He is supposed to be behind the scenes,

600
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,700
which would be behind the psyop that you have argued Q must be.

601
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,820
So how could someone behind the scenes,

602
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,820
unless you're saying that he behind the scenes was tricked

603
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:14,740
by the other behind the scenes people through Q,

604
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,540
oh no, what are you doing letting him behind the scenes?

605
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,860
If he's going to get tricked by other people behind the scenes,

606
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,980
you stay behind the scenes.

607
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,900
This psyop that I've started is too good.

608
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,020
It's tricked even me.

609
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,580
Exactly.

610
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,140
Get the fuck out of here.

611
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,420
So Alex is gracious and he thanks Steve for coming back.

612
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,980
And my note on this is just like, why are they doing?

613
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,540
Why?

614
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,100
Yeah, why?

615
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,180
And so I appreciate Steve Pachinnik coming on

616
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,460
and having the courage after he was on.

617
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,580
Well, let's punch that up.

618
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,340
Is this Steve Pachinnik's last interview?

619
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,860
Because I'll give you the date.

620
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,820
I forget the date.

621
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,140
Why?

622
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,180
I just, I don't understand.

623
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,260
This doesn't serve anyone's interests.

624
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:54,500
Steve is going to have to go even further out on a limb

625
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,580
in order to retain any sense of credibility at all.

626
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,220
Alex is going to have to either confront somebody

627
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,980
who he clearly doesn't have the fortitude to confront,

628
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:11,620
or he's going to have to get persuaded by Steve to wait and see or whatever.

629
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,700
This is a no win situation for anybody.

630
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,100
No.

631
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,020
Except for Steve, because he's got nothing to lose.

632
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,520
Right.

633
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:23,060
Alex's insistence on not preparing, coming through immediately with the,

634
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,580
I don't even remember what date it was.

635
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,620
Yeah, when was that shit?

636
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,140
Promised me that the world would be, oh my God.

637
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,460
Yeah.

638
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,340
So I think Steve sucks and I think he's a real liar and a menace.

639
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:43,540
Yeah, but that being said, I do think that the first question that Alex asks is unfair.

640
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:43,780
Okay.

641
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,060
I do think this is not the way.

642
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,700
Even there.

643
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,940
I do think this is not how you want to start an interview.

644
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,440
Okay.

645
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,660
So Steve Pacinek, tell us, was it all a big joke?

646
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,940
Are you in with the Q guys?

647
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,060
Were you part of the setup or were you really believing this was going to happen?

648
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,180
We really appreciate you coming on.

649
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,020
Number one, I enjoy coming on the show.

650
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:10,340
Number two, what I do resent is the ad hominem comments coming from your disgusting viewers

651
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:15,300
who think that I lied or in some way gave them false promises.

652
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,940
Table turned on you in a second, Alex.

653
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,140
Go fuck yourself.

654
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,860
You don't get to do this.

655
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,060
You do not.

656
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:29,940
Alex tries to frame the interview with three options for Steve to pick that are all bad.

657
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,860
Steve says, I like coming on your show.

658
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,700
What I'd like to say is that your disgusting audience is a bunch of assholes who keep saying

659
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,980
bad things about me.

660
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,380
Wild.

661
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,460
So pathetic.

662
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,060
Yeah, Steve takes control.

663
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,900
Alex has no shot.

664
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,620
Just none.

665
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,300
You can see it even immediately.

666
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,820
Just like, no, it's not even in over your head.

667
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,620
It's just you don't have the werewolf.

668
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,180
Here's what you do whenever somebody does that.

669
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,860
One, that is a shitty opening question, but also well deserved.

670
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,060
Fuck you, Steve.

671
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:04,420
And if Steve comes back with, I don't appreciate, you say, Hey, fuck you, Steve, you fucking

672
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:04,900
lied.

673
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:11,460
I would suggest that a better question is not like three possibilities that are all

674
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,980
things he can't possibly accept.

675
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,860
Right, of course.

676
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,820
A more open ended question that is leading to the, what the fuck is wrong with you, man?

677
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,460
Yes.

678
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,140
That would be a better opening question.

679
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,100
If you are wise, you will allow Steve to hang himself.

680
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,420
Right.

681
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:30,020
If you are someone who maybe prepares, you'd have a question that guides you towards where

682
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,820
you want to go, as opposed to one that your person you're talking to can completely reject

683
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,940
because it's a trap.

684
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,440
Yeah.

685
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,060
He doesn't, he just ignores it.

686
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:46,340
No, I mean, of all the, of all the like so simple judo principles to be put into, to

687
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,100
be demonstrated right here.

688
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:53,300
Alex attacks with overwhelming force and Steve just gets out of the way.

689
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:53,700
Yeah.

690
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,660
And then not hard.

691
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:59,220
And then once Alex's force has gone past him, he turns around and attacks them from the

692
00:30:59,220 --> 00:30:59,720
back.

693
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:06,500
I came on the show again to basically say to you, I will double down on the military

694
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,000
crew.

695
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:14,500
And the reason I'm doubling down is that right now it's taking more time and I don't

696
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:20,180
directly deal with military operatives as I had in the past when I went overseas.

697
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,020
So I still have faith in my cyber command.

698
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,500
I have faith in my special forces.

699
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,100
I have faith in the generals.

700
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,020
You don't have special forces teams.

701
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,300
Oh, I was right.

702
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:33,860
I was right.

703
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,900
He did double down.

704
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,140
Yeah.

705
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,580
That is what I was expecting.

706
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,060
Yeah.

707
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,460
Yep.

708
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:41,060
It's, uh, maybe not the, not the disappointing.

709
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,560
Yeah.

710
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,060
I wanted a bigger swing.

711
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,460
Yeah.

712
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,220
It's not, it's not as big a swing as you'd hope, but it is cool.

713
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,260
I mean, like in terms of like, now what are you going to do, Alex?

714
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:50,980
Yeah.

715
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,480
Yeah.

716
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,740
Steve was wrong.

717
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,300
He came back and now he's telling you he was right.

718
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:55,800
Yep.

719
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:02,500
You almost could have predicted this coming seeing as how he has had no interest in whether

720
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,380
or not reality conforms to his bullshit anyways.

721
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:05,620
Yeah.

722
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,180
Steve is absolutely gaslighting the shit out of you.

723
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:13,300
Why would you imagine that he would become contrite and be like, oh, I'm sorry for lying

724
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:13,540
to you.

725
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:17,380
Also, you're not even getting to the under the underlying emotional problem, which is

726
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,020
that he told you he has been using you.

727
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:20,900
Yeah.

728
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,140
Yeah.

729
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,180
To your face.

730
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,620
They don't get into that.

731
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,580
Surprising.

732
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,080
Yeah.

733
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,660
So everything is going according to Trump's plan apparently.

734
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:34,340
And only one person in the media really understands and gets this subtle thing that's going on.

735
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:39,140
And that is the Trump is being quiet and maybe that's because he's got an impeachment trial

736
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,060
coming up and he's been kicked off all social media.

737
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,560
Could be.

738
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,960
Uh, but one person gets it.

739
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,360
Okay.

740
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,400
This should piss off Alex, but I think he's distracted.

741
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:54,040
So what I'm saying to you right now is what you're seeing happening is exactly what Trump

742
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,000
wanted to happen.

743
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,080
He's exposing.

744
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,360
Now you got to remember one thing I've said about Trump.

745
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,600
He never fails at what he does.

746
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,880
And by the way, he has remained silent.

747
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:12,600
Only one individual picked that up repeatedly and that's Bill Maher of HBO.

748
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,280
He hit it right on the head.

749
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,320
Why is Trump silent when in his history he has never been silent?

750
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,640
Don't you fucking tell me that Bill Maher is insightful.

751
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,800
Alex's big enemy.

752
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:34,840
It's just, you know who they watch all the time by how much they reference how much they

753
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,640
hate them.

754
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,040
And then every time, because you watch Bill Maher all the time so you can hate him.

755
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,880
Eventually he says something where you're like, you know what?

756
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,480
This Bill Maher guy might be right.

757
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,400
Cause you guys are fucking children.

758
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,240
You're toddlers.

759
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,440
You can't, it's just two seconds of like, Oh, I hate him.

760
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,400
I love him.

761
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,160
I'm not going to say that this person doesn't exist, but I don't know anyone I like who

762
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,960
likes Bill Maher.

763
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,000
Ooh, I don't know anyone I like who likes Bill Maher either.

764
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,720
That person may exist and I just don't know it and I wouldn't judge them for it.

765
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:11,400
But the only people I have any evidence watch Bill Maher are people tweeting stuff.

766
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,040
Yeah.

767
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,640
And Alex and his guests.

768
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,200
Yeah, that does sound right.

769
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,520
All of them watch Bill Maher.

770
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,240
Is Bill Maher just, maybe that's why he's going so far with the racist right nonsense

771
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,760
is just, he's like, Oh, I guess the only people who watch my show are right-wing Nazis.

772
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,720
He's Dennis Millering.

773
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,440
He might be Dennis Millering in front of our eyes.

774
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,160
God damn it.

775
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:29,880
Oh boy.

776
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,200
Shit.

777
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,360
Uh, equally unfunny.

778
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,240
So, uh, Trump, his whole plan, right?

779
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,880
Is to let Biden show his ass.

780
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,600
He's going to show how incompetent he is.

781
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,880
And this is where Steve begins to drift into possible antisemitism.

782
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,600
Hey, he's showing you how corrupt and stupid Biden is.

783
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:57,160
I said to you before for years, Biden will pick those people who are incompetent and

784
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,440
corrupt and primarily they were Jewish.

785
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,320
I have a synagogue going on there with blanking with all kinds of people.

786
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,480
I've got 11 Jews in there.

787
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,800
All of whom I've never met before.

788
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,520
Some of whom I have a lot of things in common, but they were all incompetent.

789
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,000
Oh boy.

790
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,880
It seems to really be hammering on the point that people are Jewish.

791
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,280
Wow.

792
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,080
It is you, you, I, I wouldn't have even thought of that as something to bring up unless I

793
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,120
were say a Nazi.

794
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,840
Hmm.

795
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:33,400
It's so weird the way he speaks to just that, like, I've got, I've got these people in

796
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:33,880
the government.

797
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,280
Like, dude, I think he just designs trading card decks.

798
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,000
I genuinely think that he just draws like magic, the gathering cards, and they have

799
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,760
like Nancy Pelosi and deep state operative written on them.

800
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,400
And he just tosses them out like a tarot deck.

801
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:58,200
I begin to wonder if he's not like severely disturbed, like we talk about him.

802
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,880
And I think that one of the reasons that he may not come off as that is because he's in

803
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,160
the Infowars sphere.

804
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,800
Sure, sure.

805
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,360
And Alex portrays him as like this really serious character.

806
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,080
And it's really funny when he snips at Alex, but there is a part of me that, you know,

807
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:18,760
it has to wrestle with like, does he actually think that he's running like special operations

808
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,400
teams?

809
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,760
Does he think that, like, he has sway within the government and he's got these, these 11

810
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,720
Jewish people who he's never met working in various offices and that's a problem for

811
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,760
him personally?

812
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,240
I don't know.

813
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,760
His wife laughing in the background of that clip makes me really think that he's aware.

814
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,240
She laughs about some other stuff too.

815
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,080
She's, yeah.

816
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,120
Maybe she's on this, on the same boat.

817
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,280
She's in the front seat of whatever boats.

818
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,000
If so, she's not so thrilled with the Jewish people either.

819
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,880
Yeah, that sounds right.

820
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:56,200
And we have one moron from the National Security Council and the State Department, which is

821
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,160
run by Blanken and Wendy Sherman.

822
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,040
I got a Jew on top there who's never been in the military.

823
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,520
What?

824
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,120
And I have a soda-

825
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,000
Hey, Doc, we've got about an hour here.

826
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,720
We've got about 45 minutes left, but I've got to unpack all this.

827
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,480
I think Alex cut him off there because he realized like, this is going too much.

828
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,080
No, no, no, no, no.

829
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,120
You can't keep doing this.

830
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:19,080
Uh-uh, we don't, don't say I got a Jew on top ever, ever.

831
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,280
Outrageous.

832
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,840
What?

833
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,400
Outrageous.

834
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:21,900
Yeah.

835
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,120
So in this next clip, they get to the heart of the matter, which I think that you're actually

836
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,680
more correct, that the heart of the matter is that Steve revealed that he's been manipulating

837
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,180
Alex.

838
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,120
Failing getting into that because they don't.

839
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:42,280
The issue is that he said that Trump, still going to be president after January 20th,

840
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,280
sure, they get a little bit snippy.

841
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,840
Alex gets snippy with Steve about this.

842
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,640
Let's just go back.

843
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,320
Let's just go with your scenario.

844
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,800
They are doing this anti-racism stand down.

845
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,560
Let's talk about it.

846
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,680
Let's talk about it because they are trying to purge the military right now.

847
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,920
They're saying they think there's a military coup.

848
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,280
You're saying there's a military coup.

849
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,000
What's going on there?

850
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,800
I just said it to you.

851
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,840
Listen, Alex, listen, I'm telling you.

852
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,920
Listen, Trump's going to get inaugurated on the 20th.

853
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,440
I'm saying let's unpack that first.

854
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,480
I didn't say he was going to get inaugurated on the 20th.

855
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,360
I never said that.

856
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,920
I said that he would still be president of the United States.

857
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,600
What's going on in Mar-a-Lago?

858
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,480
You tell me.

859
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:23,980
Oh, boy.

860
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,000
Fucking psycho.

861
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,760
That is you.

862
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,720
You're not going to win.

863
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,520
Hang up.

864
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,800
Hang up right there.

865
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,960
Steve thinks Trump is still president.

866
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,760
Of course he does.

867
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,600
What's going on in Mar-a-Lago, Dan?

868
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,120
The office of the former president, man.

869
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,680
Exactly.

870
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,160
Yeah.

871
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,840
That's what's going on in Mar-a-Lago.

872
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,120
Former's in the name.

873
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,280
You gotta just get out of here.

874
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,880
Just hang up right then and there and be like, this guy is out.

875
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,280
Yeah.

876
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,360
If I were Alex, I'd be like, no.

877
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,480
Nah, we're not doing that.

878
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,520
Can't let you have that.

879
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,080
You don't get to be angry at me right now, sir.

880
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,200
You don't get to do that.

881
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,880
You don't understand what's happening here.

882
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:03,320
Yeah, so Alex, I guess he just has to put up with Steve saying like, I didn't say he was

883
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,120
going to get inaugurated.

884
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,400
I say he's still be president and I believe that he still is.

885
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,760
God damn.

886
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,680
So Alex tries to be a dick and tries to reclaim some sort of like, I don't know, authority

887
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,880
in the conversation.

888
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,760
It doesn't really work.

889
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,680
And then we find out that Steve also hates Mormons, which we already knew that.

890
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,640
Well then talk to us because you're so smart.

891
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,600
Like you said, we haven't been in the military like you, like it's a magical level when you

892
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,320
get there.

893
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,160
Tell us then what's going on in your view.

894
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,400
I'm just telling you right now, I said it's part of Sun Tzu.

895
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,480
You understand, Alex, what Sun Tzu is.

896
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,200
You allow the enemy to expose.

897
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,680
Who said all of the faults that they have without intervening.

898
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,040
And he's showing it to you.

899
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:52,040
The Republican party dead McConnell, a total wastrel, a corrupt individual, Mitt Romney,

900
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,480
corrupt Mormon.

901
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,840
He reminds me of the days of the massacre of Meadows that the Mormons did when they slaughtered

902
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:04,760
Christians and the Mormons were warned to take care of him and they didn't do it.

903
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,200
What?

904
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,080
Okay.

905
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,560
All right.

906
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,160
He warned the Mormons.

907
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,120
Who warned the Mormons?

908
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,080
It's gotta be Steve.

909
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,520
You warned the Mormons.

910
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,800
Listen, I warned the Mormons, come get your boy.

911
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,680
Come get your boy.

912
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,840
You don't want any more massacres on your hands.

913
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,280
Holy shit.

914
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,000
Wild.

915
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,880
Also interesting to recall that Steve also said that the Pope got arrested like a year

916
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,280
ago.

917
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,320
Yeah, but that one was true.

918
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:36,600
So at the beginning of this interview, the first way that Steve claimed authority was

919
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,680
to say like, Hey, your audience has been throwing ad hominems around your disgusting audience.

920
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,080
Yeah.

921
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,520
You're a liar, Steve.

922
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,720
A little bit later, Alex realizes that he'd called the audience discussed.

923
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,520
There you go.

924
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,720
It was out of Freudian slip.

925
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,960
You're disgusting audience, or you mean some people that said disgusting things about you

926
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,400
because most of the audience doesn't hate you.

927
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,320
Unfortunately.

928
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,360
Honestly, I don't even read most of the comments.

929
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,640
Let me be very frank.

930
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,760
I'm not interested in what your audience says or doesn't say.

931
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,760
I don't really listen.

932
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,640
Well, you said it.

933
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,200
You said it.

934
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,200
Listen to me, Alex.

935
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,400
You want me on the show?

936
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,200
Cool it.

937
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:10,600
Cool it.

938
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,400
It was military.

939
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,240
I have nothing to do with Q.

940
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,840
I don't even know who Q is.

941
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,600
I don't read that nonsense.

942
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,680
I have nothing to do with Q or anybody else other than you.

943
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,440
You're the only show I go on.

944
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,440
This is outrageous.

945
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,480
Oh man.

946
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,680
Don't do this interview.

947
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,240
This is so dumb.

948
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,440
Oh God.

949
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,600
There's no point to this, except for Steve to just be me and then see what he can get

950
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,000
away with.

951
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,480
No, the only reason you would do this interview if you're Alex is so you can throw away your

952
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,760
baggage on Steve.

953
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,960
Well, you do that or you'd recognize that, like, he does bring up repeatedly that their

954
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,280
last interview got a lot of traffic.

955
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:52,840
And the one where Steve was on with Owen saying that the election was a sting operation that

956
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,800
got a lot of traffic.

957
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:00,440
And so I think that Alex has that motivation, like an attention economy type of motivation.

958
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,400
Because of course he does.

959
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:01,960
Yeah.

960
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,240
And so Alex will take a little bit of this if it means a couple hundred thousand views

961
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:07,640
more.

962
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,520
That's true.

963
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,240
In theory.

964
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:15,080
Yeah, but I would imagine you would get a lot of views if you forced Steve to hang up

965
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,800
on you.

966
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,200
True.

967
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,700
Ooh.

968
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,840
Or if you just were like, Steve, you're making everything up.

969
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,880
Steve, you're a fucking liar.

970
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,680
Tell me more about that.

971
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,160
Yeah.

972
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,440
Steve, have you always been a psychopath?

973
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,240
Oh, no, no, no, no.

974
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:25,880
Back to the center.

975
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,440
You're a liar.

976
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,080
Yeah, Steve.

977
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,400
Hold on.

978
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:27,880
No, no, no.

979
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,520
I understand.

980
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,000
I will listen to you, but only on the answer to the question.

981
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,680
Why are you such a fucking liar, Steve?

982
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,920
Oh, Steve, you don't give a shit about what my audience thinks.

983
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,480
Great.

984
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,360
Why are you such a liar?

985
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,880
Why are you such a fucking liar?

986
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,920
Stay on point.

987
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,960
Yeah, get in there.

988
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,080
And because Alex can't do that, Steve's just running circles around him.

989
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,600
You specifically, let's just get this straight.

990
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,440
Because people understand if you were wrong about timing or whatever, you legitimately

991
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,240
thought Trump would end up being sworn in on the 20th.

992
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,360
You said he's going to be the president.

993
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,080
I didn't say he would be on the 20th.

994
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:02,440
He is still the president of the United States and he will continue to be the president.

995
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:02,760
Okay.

996
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,360
Well, I know he won the election and it's important not to recognize Biden.

997
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,640
So tell me this, what is your view on what's going to unfold?

998
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,840
How long will it take?

999
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,720
See, Alex is just, he's supplicating.

1000
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,840
What are we doing?

1001
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,560
He's trying to find ways in which you can accept the things that Steve is saying.

1002
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,480
Steve's saying that Trump is still the president.

1003
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,720
He's like, well, yeah, the election was stolen.

1004
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,640
He's trying to make excuses for Steve.

1005
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,120
Totally.

1006
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:31,000
Which is wild because this is supposed to be like Alex's you were wrong dance.

1007
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,520
How does he do this?

1008
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,360
How is this possible?

1009
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,800
It's just, I've seen it too many times.

1010
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,560
How can one man never learn?

1011
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,520
Like, is he physically incapable of the act of learning?

1012
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,160
It makes you wonder if Steve's not like independently wealthy and like paying Alex

1013
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,040
or something.

1014
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:50,360
Yeah.

1015
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:50,840
I don't know.

1016
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,120
But like, there's some dynamic here that just doesn't make sense.

1017
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:54,600
No.

1018
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:59,000
And like, it's really easy if you just see a couple examples of it to be like, Alex is

1019
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,960
dumb and gullible.

1020
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,440
Yeah.

1021
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:05,080
And maybe that is what it is, but it's such an extreme level of like, you could just get

1022
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,920
burned by this dude over and over again.

1023
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,240
Yeah.

1024
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:12,280
No, this is fealty on, on like Sith Lord levels of like, you know, he's trying to kill you

1025
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,240
all the time, right?

1026
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,920
What are we doing here, man?

1027
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:21,960
So you're seeing right now the exposure of the Biden corrupt incompetent government.

1028
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:30,520
What you're seeing now is the exposure of a corrupt incompetent regime of Biden and

1029
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,640
all his people.

1030
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:36,920
And what it really is, it's not only an indictment of Biden, forget that.

1031
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,600
It's an indictment of Obama and Brennan.

1032
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,920
This goes to the heart of the matter.

1033
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:48,040
Obama, as I told you, was a gay, flaming homosexual.

1034
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:54,200
Nobody who came was the CIA operative and Brennan was his control officer.

1035
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:54,760
All right.

1036
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,400
All right.

1037
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,200
Okay.

1038
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:04,680
So instead of exoriating Steve for being a psychopathic liar, he is instead allowing

1039
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,680
Steve to be a raging bigot.

1040
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,320
Yeah.

1041
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,760
With no pushback whatsoever.

1042
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,520
Well, I don't think Alex sees a problem with any of that.

1043
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,160
Well, that I do understand that.

1044
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,120
Yes, I agree.

1045
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,120
Although this next clip does get into territory where Alex has a problem.

1046
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,560
And that is Steve is like, I love Brian Stelter.

1047
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,600
No, no.

1048
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,360
And just your narratives aren't real.

1049
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,680
Like, Alex, the two of them are arguing about whether or not the election was stolen.

1050
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,320
Great.

1051
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:34,520
Am I getting through to you how incompetent and what we have to show?

1052
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,080
Yeah, they stole the election and took over.

1053
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,040
They stole what election?

1054
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,640
They stole the election and take over.

1055
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,600
They're so incompetent.

1056
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,560
Checkmate.

1057
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,760
Let me ask you, how do you know they stole the election?

1058
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,360
We are the numbers coming in.

1059
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,200
Trump had double, triple, quadruple in battleground states before they shut down the election

1060
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,000
that night and stole it.

1061
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,160
And you said it's a theta complete, right?

1062
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,680
You think that's over?

1063
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,960
And I'm saying here's the deal.

1064
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,440
I never give up, but I'm also realistic about what I face.

1065
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,880
And you think I am a wishful thinker.

1066
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,360
That's why I come on your show.

1067
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,960
I just know that I talk to a lot of people in the government.

1068
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,760
Hold on, Steve.

1069
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,760
Seriously, listen, hold on a minute.

1070
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,440
I mean, I talk to a lot of really smart people.

1071
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,120
They tell me the country's in deep, deep trouble and we're in a globalist takeover right now.

1072
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,880
They're planning to set bombs off all over the country and start trying a civil war.

1073
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,280
So I'm really concerned for my family, everybody else right now.

1074
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,920
Oh, who's going to set bombs?

1075
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,400
The Southern Poverty Law Center.

1076
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,440
Southern Poverty Law Center?

1077
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,320
Yeah, they're in Elohim City. They ran the attack on Oklahoma City out.

1078
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,400
Come on, come on, come on.

1079
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,680
I know them very well.

1080
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,200
They haven't said anything.

1081
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,720
I know that.

1082
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,720
Come on.

1083
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,760
The SPLC and I play golf on the weekends.

1084
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,960
What are you talking about?

1085
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,360
Alex, you're saying that the SPLC did Oklahoma City and they're planning bombings.

1086
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,280
What are you talking about?

1087
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,400
Also, Alex, the only people threatening to do bombs and all that stuff.

1088
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,760
We're on your show.

1089
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,960
Yeah, or associates thereof.

1090
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,600
So I think that's really funny because this is not threatening to Alex,

1091
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:19,960
except because Steve is seen as a credible voice because of Alex's actions.

1092
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,840
Yes, indeed.

1093
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:25,480
None of this would be a problem except for that Alex can't discount him as a crazy person.

1094
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:31,720
No, unfortunately this petard is too high, so I will have to jump on top of it.

1095
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,960
I know the SPLC. Alex, what election? The election's not done.

1096
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,280
That's a solid swing. I like that response. I like that response.

1097
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,840
So the election was stolen. What election?

1098
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:47,480
Ooh, now we've got a whole new wrinkle into our little lunacy.

1099
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:55,880
So one of the main devices by which Steve exerts his control over Alex is flattery, of course,

1100
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,720
and also patronizing him.

1101
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:58,200
Yes.

1102
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,280
He treats him like a little baby.

1103
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:00,840
Right.

1104
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,960
But a lot of the flattery is in service of that patronizing.

1105
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,040
Indeed. It infantilizes him in such a way.

1106
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,440
Oh, you're such an insightful mind.

1107
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:14,200
Yeah. No, no. It's interesting that we start with Alex being like,

1108
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,720
my dad told me this when I was younger, so I'm going to believe it until I die.

1109
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,720
And then we get CVPs coming in here doing it like, oh, you're a good boy.

1110
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:26,280
Now stop it. Don't you do that. But you're a good boy. You're a good boy.

1111
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:26,780
Yeah.

1112
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:32,220
Hmm. Alex knows that because he now in the middle of this interview,

1113
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:37,100
they start arguing about whether or not Steve is patronizing him, which is really sad.

1114
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:37,900
This is just sad.

1115
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:44,140
And now here in Florida, we're not listening to either Fauci, who, by the way, was exposed.

1116
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:49,980
Isn't that interesting? Trump didn't have to say he was a total fraud because the New York Times

1117
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,860
and the Atlantic Monthly exposed nonsense about wearing a mask.

1118
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:58,780
Now you don't wear one mask. You wear two masks. So take it easy, Alex.

1119
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,700
Listen to what's going on. Do not get upset.

1120
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,980
And what I'm nice to you. And I think you actually believe the stuff you're saying.

1121
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,780
And you're an interesting talk show host and people like you on the show.

1122
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:14,700
So I like you as a person. But the patronizing dude, I'm 47 years old.

1123
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,700
I've been around the block 100 times. I don't patronize you. I'm being serious about this.

1124
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,380
What do you want me to say?

1125
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:27,340
I've said to you, Alex, I've said to you exactly what's happening.

1126
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,180
Am I patronizing you?

1127
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:29,680
Yes.

1128
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,060
Am I saying you're wrong?

1129
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:32,560
Yes.

1130
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:38,700
I just this show is fucked up.

1131
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:44,780
Like this is supposed to be a show where you talk about the the politics and the deep workings

1132
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,140
of the New World Order.

1133
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:52,780
Deep workings of the New World Order. The first hour is grotesque discussions of imaginary

1134
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,380
child abuse fantasies that he has.

1135
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:01,340
Second hour is a psycho drama with an old man who's been manipulating him for years.

1136
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,500
Yeah, we're watching a weird soap opera right now.

1137
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,180
And it's it's a little bit. I'm not sure what's going on here.

1138
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:10,700
I think this second hour, Alex thought he was going to come in and be like,

1139
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,060
hey, Steve, you fucked up.

1140
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:15,340
Yeah, Steve was like, you know what? You get some right. You get some wrong.

1141
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,420
And they could build the next thing.

1142
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:20,300
And instead, Steve's like, Trump is still president.

1143
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,260
How do you not see this coming?

1144
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,100
How do you not see this coming?

1145
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:29,900
And because Steve is a wall, he's not somebody that's going to move and he doesn't give a fuck.

1146
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,700
Why would he?

1147
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,200
Yeah.

1148
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,420
What exertion can you put upon Steve to make him move?

1149
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,260
Oh, you can't come on my show anymore?

1150
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,860
Clearly I can.

1151
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:46,140
Yeah. And Alex seems to have gotten to that realization and he starts kind of trying to

1152
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,820
help Steve make his arguments more.

1153
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,780
God, I hate him so much.

1154
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:53,420
Steve is saying that Trump is still president at the Mar-a-Lago and what have you.

1155
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:53,900
Sure.

1156
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:58,140
And he's going to come back, which coincidentally is another Q narrative.

1157
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:58,780
Yeah. Okay.

1158
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,220
But yeah, he's like.

1159
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:04,620
I don't know anything about Q. I don't read that stuff from this website, this website,

1160
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:08,140
this website, this website, this website, and this website that I don't read.

1161
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:13,580
Suspiciously, most of the stuff I say has to do with things that are popular in Q communities,

1162
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,100
but it's a coincidence.

1163
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:15,600
Yeah.

1164
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:20,380
So yeah, I mean, for someone who is pretending to disagree with Steve,

1165
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,700
Alex is trying to help make that point that Trump's going to return.

1166
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:28,860
Now they're obsessed with Trump. They're saying he's getting more popular, not less.

1167
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:33,580
That, that actually has credibility with Pechenich saying, Pechenich, in my opinion,

1168
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:36,620
is walking back a little bit that had this big events could happen on the 20th.

1169
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:42,540
Uh, but, but I do agree. They stole the election. Trump is the president, but here he is last year,

1170
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,820
seven, eight months ago, I'm going from memory. Maybe you guys can find the day.

1171
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:51,900
Here he is at a appliance factory in the Midwest saying, Hey, I've, I've stood up to big pharma.

1172
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,860
We're paying the highest prices. I've cut the prices, which he did by half.

1173
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:59,260
They're going to come after me. I'm going to be gone for a while. Here it is.

1174
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:03,980
He's have to produce a product and it has to be a good product, but the middlemen,

1175
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:09,340
well, the rebate that I'm doing cuts out the middle men and it reduces costs. And the

1176
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:14,220
money goes back to the people purchasing the drugs. So I have a lot of enemies out there.

1177
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:18,940
This may be the last time you'll see me for a while. A lot of very, very rich enemies,

1178
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:23,740
but they are not happy with what I'm doing, but I figured we have one chance to do it.

1179
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:29,660
And no other president's going to do what I do. No other president would do a favored nations,

1180
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:36,540
a rebate, a buy from other nations at much less cost. Nobody. And there are a lot of unhappy

1181
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:40,540
people. And then he said at the military base, before he got on the planet, Florida,

1182
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:45,340
Malago, he said, I will, I will be back. So, so that adds something there to what you're

1183
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:49,660
saying, but you know, I just want to put all our marbles on Trump. Why are you doing this?

1184
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:56,540
Why are you doing this? This is outrageous. There's no reason to do this. You're supposed

1185
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:01,260
to disagree with Steve, not go out of your way to find clips of Trump that

1186
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:09,180
seem to back up what Steve's saying. I, I, I just, I'm just, just jangle keys.

1187
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:13,660
Is that what we need to do? Do we, have we just been jangling keys wrong? Has that been our

1188
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:17,900
problem? Is that why the right has been allowed to flourish is we haven't found the right color

1189
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,700
of keys to dangle outside of their vision so they can get distracted instantaneously.

1190
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:28,700
It's pretty, I don't know, man. This is why this is fucking out of, I, I, no,

1191
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,220
you don't let it get people get it. They don't get away with it.

1192
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:38,860
So I have two clips here from Steve's interview. There's more, but these next two are just sort of

1193
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:44,780
like, I got lost in the incoherence and pointlessness of this interview, but I still

1194
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:49,820
think that these two clips are interesting to listen to for the social dynamics between these

1195
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:56,300
two dudes. But that my point is this, what he's letting you do is the biggest apprentice show he's

1196
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:03,900
ever done. He's putting America into project. He's literally showing you the American show,

1197
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:09,580
which is massive corruption. And the first president, we didn't have it with Bush senior.

1198
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:15,020
He was corrupt. I worked with him. We didn't have it with Nixon. He was corrupt. Jimmy Carter. He

1199
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:22,460
was corrupt. Clinton's they were corrupt. Okay. Let me just tell you what I witnessed. Trump means

1200
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:26,540
well, he cares about the country. He's not out to get us. He was the president that pissed him off.

1201
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:32,460
I was there when almost the whole white house was gone and he had like 10 staffers that were loyal.

1202
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,540
And then, and then, and then the secret service stood down at the Capitol and he literally pointed

1203
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,980
at me and I led the people out. And I was like, my God, this is really happening. And then we

1204
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:45,420
got set up. So just the idea that Trump's got all this masterful stuff going on. This sounds

1205
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:50,220
like a reboot. I mean, I agree politically, what you're saying is happening. This is destroying by

1206
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,820
the Democrats worse than ever. As they turn the economy off, as they launch all these wars,

1207
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:58,540
people are like, whoa, this is horrible. I get it at a Machiavelli level or a Sun Tzu level or

1208
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,140
a Napoleon level. They'll interrupt your enemy while they're destroying themselves. But I mean,

1209
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:05,820
they're destroying us. They're, they're, they're coming after our guns. They are,

1210
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:09,980
I think they'll lose in the end, but they're just crazy. So I just don't,

1211
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:13,420
I mean, I know people that know Trump well, he's isolated at Mar-a-Lago right now.

1212
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:19,580
And what, what, the point is what? That is my question too.

1213
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:28,700
That's a good response because that was incoherent. It was a whole bunch of different

1214
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,940
spaghetti strands being thrown up against the wall. Yeah. I think he might as well have just

1215
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:38,220
said, I'm not going to bail you out on that one. Nope. Nope. You're going to stare. Yeah.

1216
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:46,860
You are saying what now? So they're talking about Trump being isolated there at the end. And this,

1217
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:52,540
this goes on to just bickering. The point is you're saying Trump is like, you know,

1218
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:56,940
Mr. Spacely and the Jetsons with all his hands on the levers for my information,

1219
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,900
he needs to be out in the public fighting. He needs to be exposing. He needs to go into that

1220
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,780
trial to annihilate them in the Senate and be thrown in that briar patch. Instead,

1221
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,140
he's totally cut off with a bunch of cowardly lawyers telling him to be afraid of a shadow.

1222
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:17,980
How do you know he's totally cut off? I mean, I mean, I've talked to the president,

1223
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,780
some people that talk to him. I know, I know the lawyers that are involved. I mean,

1224
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:29,180
I know that he's cut off. And what is this next trial about the second impeachment? What does

1225
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:33,980
that mean? No, it's totally fake. John Roberts isn't involved. It's a sham. Now they're trying

1226
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:37,900
to back off of it. I think he should go into that briar patch and use that to expose them.

1227
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:45,580
But he's already, when did you ever hear besides what I have said that John Roberts is one of the

1228
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:51,820
most corrupt Supreme Court justices we've ever had. He's been involved with Malta. He's been

1229
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:57,340
involved with all kinds of problems and his adoption of kids. When did you ever hear that

1230
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:03,020
other than from me? And now you're beginning to see how the chief justice of the Supreme Court

1231
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:09,660
is so corrupt and what may have happened to another chief justice. Was somebody killed by

1232
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:14,220
the way? Was there a member of the Supreme Court who might've been killed? I don't know.

1233
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:22,060
What are you doing? Wait, what is happening now? No, Steve, you're a fucking liar. Yeah. I can't

1234
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:27,740
tell if he's going back to Scalia or if he's talking about like a current Supreme Court

1235
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:34,620
justice or Ruth Bader Ginsburg maybe. Did they kill somebody? Just tell me who. It's a sitting

1236
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:38,940
Supreme Court justice dead and we're in a fucking... Stop playing this vague game. It's not fun. Are we

1237
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:46,540
weekend Bernie easing half the Supreme Court right now? So dumb. So that kind of is indicative of how

1238
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:53,340
a lot of this interview goes. There's just two delusional weirdos but with slightly different

1239
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:59,100
delusions that neither is really willing to give up. Although Alex's commitment is so much weaker

1240
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:05,420
than Steve's and so you find him coming around. My God's a wolf so he'll kill your God. Nah,

1241
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:10,300
my God's an eagle so he'll kill your God. No, a wolf has jumping powers and this and that. Yeah,

1242
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:15,020
I don't care. I don't care. You're arguing about imaginary nonsense. No, there is one thing you

1243
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:21,020
might care about. What's that? And that is bets. They made a bet. Bets? Yeah. Okay. They made a bet

1244
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:27,260
and that is that if Steve was correct he would get a job at Infowars. Correct. If Steve was not

1245
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:33,260
correct he could never come back on again. So the bet is now meaningless. Well, here's an interesting

1246
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:38,940
question. Are we double or nothinging? There's no arbiter of who is right or who is wrong. I thought

1247
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:45,340
reality was. Well, Steve insists that Trump is still president. That's fair. So what happens then?

1248
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:51,580
That's a good question. Steve thinks he's won this bet. That is, that is a fascinating conundrum we

1249
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:56,780
have found ourselves in. Yes and so Alex suggests a middle ground that I don't think anyone is going

1250
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:01,820
to go for. People like it when you come on the show. So even though you didn't win the bet,

1251
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:06,220
you did come back on the show. So I appreciate that. We're gonna go to break.

1252
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:10,380
Can you hear me? And what if I'm right? Will you eventually hire me then?

1253
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,660
Only if you come host a show with David Knight.

1254
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:20,060
All right, we're gonna go to break. We're gonna come right back on the other side.

1255
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:25,020
Wow, ladies and gentlemen. That would be a hot show actually. Those two together.

1256
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:29,660
They have little canes and beat each other in the heads with them. Okay, folks, we're gonna go to

1257
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:34,140
break. Little people hitting each other. I'm not saying they're little people. That's a quote from

1258
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:38,860
Time Band. It's a pretty funny movie. Whoa. Wow. Listen, I gotta pay some bills or I won't be here.

1259
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:47,180
Yes, I will. I don't know. I don't know if I could stop myself from at least tuning in to see what

1260
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:54,220
David Knight and Stevie P's show would be like. I don't know these people personally, but I find it

1261
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:58,540
very difficult to imagine that David would ever agree to that. Oh, I would love it though.

1262
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:07,020
The dynamic between them. Steve is a loud, boorish, nonsense peddler and David Knight is a quiet,

1263
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,180
stated moron. But that's why I think David wouldn't do it. Well, yeah, obviously.

1264
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:16,300
I don't know. He's been out of work for a while. When you've been out of work for a while,

1265
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:20,540
sometimes you're like, I'll take one. He's boring as hell and we're not into him,

1266
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:25,500
but that doesn't mean that there isn't an audience that came along with him. He's doing his own show

1267
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:31,420
on something. Maybe a bit shoot. I don't fucking know. But I bet he's making something off that.

1268
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:37,420
Who knows? I don't know. And I bet that Alex gave him some money. Yeah, I would believe that. I

1269
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:41,260
would absolutely believe that. There is almost certainly some shut up money. Oh, yeah. Oh,

1270
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:47,660
yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I do like the idea of Alex suggesting that he can have a show if he co-hosts

1271
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:53,420
David Knight because that is a fuck you to David Knight. A huge fuck you to David Knight. And

1272
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:58,700
that's the only thing it is. It's not a serious suggestion. It doesn't bother Steve. No. It is

1273
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:02,460
a way of him saying, I'm not going to hire you. Yeah, absolutely. That's true. That's true. But

1274
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:06,060
everybody knew that he wasn't going to get hired anyways and Stevie Peace wouldn't want a job

1275
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:10,300
even if it was offered. I think Steve would. I think it's actually, I mean, Steve saying,

1276
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:14,780
are you still going to hire me? I think that that's one of the few moments of weakness that

1277
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:20,060
you kind of see from Steve that he's actually, he seems interested in that, which is weird.

1278
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:24,540
Wow. So he really does think he's right. Well, yeah. Or at least he thinks he can gaslight

1279
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:32,460
Alex into a job. Imagine how gullible the employees at InfoWars are if you can trick

1280
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:41,260
Alex this easily. Wild. Yeah. I would say, you know, Steve needs someone to help him turn on

1281
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:46,620
the Skype and stuff. So if I were him, yeah, maybe you would want to get a job at InfoWars.

1282
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:52,460
They're producers there. That's true. I don't know. That's true. Anyway, Steve is a man of many

1283
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:58,220
talents. Getting Aldo Morrow killed is one of them. Yeah. Lying to Alex. That wasn't really

1284
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:03,260
a talent. He was really good at it. Well, that's more of a proficiency, I suppose.

1285
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:09,980
But turns out he has another skill that Alex brings up and that is poetry reading.

1286
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:17,340
Okay. Look, he actually goes to coffee shops and reads poetry in his off time. So this guy

1287
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:22,140
doesn't just go out there. A bunch of Tom Clancy or help found Delta Force. He's reading poetry

1288
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:26,780
and, and, and everybody gets really excited when he talks about who it's dedicated to.

1289
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:42,780
This is called Impending Chaos by Steve Pichanik. Here's the end of it.

1290
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:08,460
Penetrating the invisible and the dead. Silence the common one. For those who go, not die or

1291
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:20,540
disappear. Glorious in excelsis. Theopolis. Lucifer will bear the morning star for heaven and

1292
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:30,940
earth. Lucifer, amen. What is this? So it's like, Oh, false narratives, but someday they'll come

1293
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:37,340
true. Like HP Lovecraft, like someday even death may die. So is this a love letter to Lucifer,

1294
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:40,620
Steve Pichanik? Are you secretly got a little heart for the devil?

1295
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:49,180
No, I have the heart for no, neither the devil nor the angels. What I have a heart for

1296
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:54,380
is simply, and why I go on your show, you're the only show I ever go on is number one,

1297
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:58,860
your incredible intelligence. Number two, your incredible sense of humor.

1298
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:03,820
Let me, let me, let me, let me translate that for you. My religion is fucking with you.

1299
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:09,100
That's the only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning. I don't care about the devil.

1300
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:13,020
I don't care about the angels. I am going to manipulate the shit out of you.

1301
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:20,780
It's just what I got to do. Ah, this, this is a new poem. Uh, a rat done bit my sister Nell.

1302
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:26,620
Um, I think it's Steve's a weird dude. The idea that he's doing poetry readings is

1303
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:30,860
interesting. Makes perfect sense to me. I mean, on some level, yeah.

1304
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:37,980
It's nice that he has hobbies that are harmless. I don't understand why Alex would

1305
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:44,300
respond to a poem that ends with a amen to Lucifer, as if it's just a joke when he takes

1306
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:49,500
this very, very seriously than anybody else brings up the devil or doesn't bring up the devil.

1307
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,060
Yeah, especially when they don't bring up the devil, I would argue.

1308
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:53,820
Now here's what's interesting. What's that?

1309
01:04:54,460 --> 01:05:02,460
After this, I can't tell if this is a joke or not, but Steve literally refers to himself as a son of

1310
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:09,980
Lucifer. Okay. Now as Lucifer and the son of Lucifer, I basically looked at cold fact. When

1311
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:18,780
nine 11 occurred, I was ostracized within minutes. I was deprecated ostracized and Bob Gates of the

1312
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:25,500
secretary of defense and the former DCI, whom I couldn't admire at all. I thought he was disgusting

1313
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:31,100
and stupid because he couldn't get in the rank corporation. Basically warned me not to do a coup.

1314
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:36,220
I almost guarantee that right after nine 11, Steve was not a high priority.

1315
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:40,540
No, I don't. I don't think people are like, Oh no, Steve's going to run a coup.

1316
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:44,860
No, it was, it was between the first and the second. They were like, real quick,

1317
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:49,580
we got to make sure Steve is out of step. Get him in the box.

1318
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:56,300
Steve has been waiting to do a coup for no reason. Now we got something. Get him.

1319
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:01,340
Yeah. I think he might've been joking, but I was, I was blown away that Alex doesn't like,

1320
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:05,100
why'd you refer to yourself as a son of Lucifer? Should we be talking?

1321
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:09,580
Ah, Dan, we are all technically the sons of Lucifer, Lucifer, of course, the light bringer

1322
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:15,900
and Michael, the demiurge, the two of them together without which none of creation would happen.

1323
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,460
I find it weird. Okay. Well, that's also fair.

1324
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:24,380
I also find it weird that this interview kind of ends with Alex and Steve being buddies and

1325
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:27,340
they're just sort of shit ago, David Knight. I hate them both.

1326
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:32,060
Would you host a daily show with David Knight? I'll bring him back. If you host it with him.

1327
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:40,300
I have no hard feelings for David Knight. It's not an issue of David Knight or you or me.

1328
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:50,220
All I'm saying is I want to come back on your show and say to you, okay, where's my position?

1329
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:53,180
I agree. How about a debate between you and David Knight? That'd be great.

1330
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:57,580
Oh, no, not yet. This is an attack. I hope David does well.

1331
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,020
David's got his own show. He's doing right now.

1332
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:04,300
Wait, I thought you said it was a budget thing.

1333
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:11,820
Huh? That's weird. If I were David Knight, I would take this as an attack too, because it is.

1334
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:15,020
David's going to take this as an attack, but it's not because I love him very much

1335
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:18,700
and I definitely haven't been attacking him this entire time. No, that'd be weird.

1336
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,980
He seems to be also sort of thinking of David Knight as a thing.

1337
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:25,900
You know, like I'll bring him back. I don't think he's a human come back.

1338
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:29,660
No, he's a human being, sir. I will make him dance with you.

1339
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:38,300
Wild. I would be so, so furious. That wouldn't even insult me. If I was David Knight,

1340
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:42,700
that would insult me. That Steve is back would insult me more than anything I could imagine.

1341
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:47,660
I think if I were David, I'd probably be considering speaking to a lawyer to break my

1342
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:52,780
NBA. Totally. I would just be like, all right, well, now it's time to talk about everything I

1343
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:58,460
know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, you can't do this. You fired me because this guy lied and then you

1344
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:04,140
called him on it and then you brought him back and now you're buddies again? No, fuck you. I'm out.

1345
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:06,780
I think the problem is that, you know, Steve's a good guy.

1346
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:11,900
All right. Well, I think you meant what you said, and I don't think you did it out of meanness

1347
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:16,940
or madness. And that's what my gut tells me. So steveachinney.com. Hey, come back on next week.

1348
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:21,500
We're challenging David Knight. He come in studio and we will. Okay. All right. Hey,

1349
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,380
steveachinney.com. Thank you so much. We got another guest coming up. I appreciate

1350
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:27,900
spending time with us. All right. We'll be right back. Well, that was a powerful interview,

1351
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,780
ladies and gentlemen, and definitely something is going on. I don't know what it is,

1352
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:35,660
but it's crazy. The office of the former president. Yeah. Something is going on.

1353
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:40,220
I don't know. I don't know what needs to happen other than like a permanent dunk

1354
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:45,020
tank for these two idiots. There's no place that they can be allowed in polite society

1355
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:49,340
without being a cancer upon the rest of us, other than in a permanent dunk tank,

1356
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:54,460
where I can throw apples at a target. I mean, I understand what you're saying and I hear,

1357
01:08:54,460 --> 01:09:03,740
I hear you. I don't under, I don't get it. Nah. I, I can't imagine, like I've listened to this

1358
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:13,420
show so much for so long and legitimately there's just a reality that is being denied by Steve.

1359
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:17,180
And I would have thought that Alex would stand up for basic tenants of reality.

1360
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:21,820
Just anything. Anything. I can't, I can't believe this interview went how it did.

1361
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:26,940
No, I'm, I'm, I'm. It's outrageous. No, I'm furious. I'm furious.

1362
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:30,460
I didn't know what to expect when I heard like Steve's coming in. He's got to face the music.

1363
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:37,580
I wasn't expecting this. I was not expecting, I am shaking with rage on, I guess, Alex's behalf.

1364
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:44,940
Alex can't decide whether or not he wants to like say Steve is wrong and push back against his shit

1365
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:50,140
or like play clips of Trump saying I'm going to be gone for a while to try and help Steve make his

1366
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:55,420
arguments. He's trying to play both sides of this fence and you can't. Nope. It makes no sense to.

1367
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:59,980
One of them is, uh, well actually both of them are imagined. Eh, fuck it. Who cares?

1368
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:02,300
Do whatever you want, but you're a monster and an idiot.

1369
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:05,020
I thought that there would be a point where Alex would just have to be like,

1370
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:10,700
Steve, we've gone too far. Yeah. I wish you the best. Have fun in Florida. Uh,

1371
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,820
I'm not talking to you anymore. And no, it turns out there's not.

1372
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:16,380
Nope. We're buddies now. Yeah. I, I just.

1373
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:21,500
It really makes me wonder like what happened after the Las Vegas shooting that made Alex

1374
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:24,860
stop talking to him for a good like six, eight months.

1375
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:28,220
Better legal advice. Maybe. Maybe he had more to protect then,

1376
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:31,420
or maybe, maybe David Knight was more of an influence then.

1377
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:38,140
Could be. Could be. I just, I'm, I'm. The judgment skills are outrageously bad.

1378
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,460
I really am a little bit speechless at this. Yeah.

1379
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:43,740
This is the. Well, get ready to be

1380
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,340
speechful, uh, because Alex has another guest. Oh no.

1381
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,540
In the third hour. Okay.

1382
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,260
And, uh, he's a boog boy. Oh God.

1383
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:55,580
Alex is in love with the boogaloo boys. I don't, I can't hang.

1384
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:58,620
He has Magnus Panvidio back on. What are we doing?

1385
01:10:58,620 --> 01:10:59,500
Yeah. What are we doing?

1386
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:03,820
Because Magnus offered to get this Antifa person, uh, for Alex to interview.

1387
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:06,940
And so this is the coming to fruition of that. Uh huh.

1388
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:14,380
It's not really that interesting outside of saying that like Alex is clearly down now.

1389
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:15,580
Yeah. With the boogaloo boys.

1390
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:19,660
Yeah. Um, and uh, Magnus is still full of shit.

1391
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:24,620
Yeah. So just having people talking to each other and more and more groups kind of reaching out

1392
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:30,540
and then the establishment has kind of picked up wind of this and a lot of progressive and liberal

1393
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:34,220
YouTube channels that have been talking about, Hey, maybe unity, Hey, maybe we should work

1394
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:37,740
together with X Trump supporters. They've started to get demonetized or have their

1395
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:41,900
Facebook pages talked out. We'll take it out. Which is like, Oh, that's really convenient that,

1396
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:45,260
you know, like they're saying the same thing they've been saying all last year,

1397
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:48,220
but the moment they started to be like, Hey, maybe we should work with Trump supporters.

1398
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,260
Maybe we should reach out to the right. They get there.

1399
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:57,420
You know, you guys want revolution and a change. You don't want a civil war, right?

1400
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:00,620
Yeah. And that's, that's what they want. And that's what I've been saying from the very beginning.

1401
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:06,140
Wow. Okay. What, what's, uh, what's the, what is the boogaloo mean then?

1402
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:09,980
Yeah. Like just like, Oh yeah, you don't want, you don't want a civil war. Okay.

1403
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:13,900
Interesting. Yeah. Interesting. Cause why are you wearing a Hawaiian shirt?

1404
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,700
Yeah. It's a big luau, right? No, don't, don't tell me.

1405
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,580
Why does your flag have a big igloo on it? Oh, big igloo, boogaloo. Oh,

1406
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:23,660
it's all electric boogaloo. Part two. Civil war two. Come on, dude.

1407
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:28,300
These people need to stop fucking around. Stop pretending out unreal.

1408
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:32,620
I just think they need to be honest. And that's one of the reasons why these interviews are

1409
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:40,460
so weird is because there's deceptiveness, but there it's clearly like deceptiveness

1410
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:43,020
for the target audience. Yeah.

1411
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:46,940
Like this is deceptiveness. That's tailored to Alex's audience.

1412
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:55,980
Yeah. This is more infomercial. This is not an interview. This isn't a fucking news show.

1413
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:59,420
This is an infomercial for why you should be cool with the boogaloo boys.

1414
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:03,340
Yeah. Yeah. And one of the things you might be afraid of is that they want a civil war.

1415
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:07,980
He's just said they don't. Great. Now he doesn't want a civil war,

1416
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:10,780
but what he does want is a war against the government.

1417
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:15,260
The opponent, everyone we've always talked about is the federal government.

1418
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:21,260
There's never a meme made or a post made about going out and fighting Democrats or going out

1419
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:25,420
and attacking Trump supporters. None of our information, none of our messaging has ever

1420
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:29,260
been about that. Everything we've always talked about is the government and particularly the

1421
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:33,660
federal government. That's always been the opponent. So it's never been a civil war.

1422
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:38,860
And we've already, most of us have stated that if there was some Republican versus Democrat

1423
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:43,420
kind of civil warfare, most of us wouldn't participate. We would go out into our cabins

1424
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:47,020
and into the woods and just try to stay out of it.

1425
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:52,860
Go fuck yourself. But also, this is so disingenuous because he's pretending that he has this idea of

1426
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:57,980
this war against the federal government as if the majority of the country wouldn't side with

1427
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:05,580
the government over him. That's the part that is the real imaginary world bullshit that he's trying

1428
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:10,780
to pull off. It's like, no, yeah, we don't want to hurt anybody. What about everybody who thinks

1429
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:16,060
that the government shouldn't be overthrown by force? Oh, well, I mean, I've never seen it.

1430
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:19,820
You end up having to hurt them. No, no, no. I've never met any of those people. I've been

1431
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:24,380
on the internet. Everybody hates the federal government. So what'll happen is all of the

1432
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:29,900
people in the United States. Now, obviously I assume that the people who are paid by the

1433
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:34,620
federal government, you know, there's what, three, four, five million people? There's a lot of people

1434
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:40,940
that would probably rejoin the boogaloo boy in this fight against the federal government.

1435
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:46,300
Wow. Wow. Wow. It's delusional. And it's, I mean, look, yeah, obviously there's a lot of

1436
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:50,620
dissatisfaction with the government. There's a lot of people who want structural fundamental changes.

1437
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:55,260
That is not the same as people who would say like, yeah, I'll take up arms with you against the

1438
01:14:55,260 --> 01:15:01,100
federal government. No, fuck that. This is outrageous. That is just unacceptable. But

1439
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:07,660
it's the disingenuous framing of what the agenda and the goals are. Yeah. So outrageous. Yep. And

1440
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:13,900
one of the things that is, it seems to be the real thrust of these PR campaigns that Magnus is doing

1441
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:20,700
is that he wants to be a living example in this embodiment of how the media lies about all these

1442
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:24,700
groups. And maybe you're getting a different version of those groups than actually exists.

1443
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:29,580
Yeah, it's picking up steam and particularly like people are starting to look into things

1444
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:34,540
and starting to question whether, you know, they had false beliefs on all of these different

1445
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:38,380
movements, or even if they didn't have false beliefs that their feelings on them were

1446
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:43,740
exaggerated or focused by the media to an extreme, to get them to the point where they dehumanize

1447
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:48,860
half the population. And that happens on both sides. It's total radicalization. It's total

1448
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:54,540
radicalization. He's talking to a guy who says that all the Democrats work for Satan.

1449
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:59,580
Yeah. I don't, I don't know. I don't know how to, I don't know how to listen to this, Dan. Yeah,

1450
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:03,420
you can. I don't know how to listen to people judge. Oh no, no, no. How dare the others?

1451
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:15,260
These people are both full of shit to each other. They're not acting at all with any kind of decorum.

1452
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:19,340
No, this hurts my brain. It does. This hurts my brain. It's hard to navigate reality in the

1453
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:25,420
internet era. It's very, very difficult listening to these two assholes talk, knowing in the back

1454
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:30,620
of my mind that no matter what these guys are saying, they are dreaming of watching me bleed

1455
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:37,020
to death. That is what they both desire. Watching me personally bleed to death. Well, that's because

1456
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:43,420
your blood coming out is not really a pain to you. It's really more of a demon leaving your body.

1457
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:50,140
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, no, no, no. I'm gonna, I'm gonna go with the more that this guy talks, the more I

1458
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:55,420
just like that, oh no, no, no. The people are hearing that the media lies they've been telling

1459
01:16:55,420 --> 01:17:01,660
about this. All you're saying is one, your bullshit is working and two, you are doing this in service

1460
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:08,860
of watching me bleed to death. So fuck you. So Magnus gets to continuing this point and, you know,

1461
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:15,420
some people, some people act like their, their opposition is actually literally evil. Like the

1462
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:21,260
person he's talking to right now. You have people that literally view like everyone in the opposing

1463
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:26,700
party as like some evil, destructive force that has to be physically removed. And the fact that

1464
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:30,460
people, you know, people don't get to that naturally. You don't hate your neighbor like that

1465
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:34,780
as just a regular human being. It's totally manufactured. It's totally pushed by the media

1466
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:40,300
to get people to that point. What do you think is going to happen to Biden post-Trump?

1467
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:45,340
Yeah, Alex has to pivot and change the subject because he's talking about exactly what Alex does.

1468
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:49,340
You know, he's saying like, oh, this isn't real. It's not, it's not organic. It's manufactured

1469
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:53,020
by the media, the media that you're talking to. Me, I'm saying that we should kill all the

1470
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:57,500
Democrats. I've said that before. I've said that they are all in service of the literal Christian

1471
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:01,900
devil. Are you saying that the other side dehumanizes their opponents? Because if they do,

1472
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:06,940
I want to sue them for intellectual property. It's outrageous. They're just using each other

1473
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:16,620
and the end result is just... No, I just, ugh. So, um, the media has a vested interest in making,

1474
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:20,860
uh, you know, the people who are a threat to the media and their enemies. They want these groups

1475
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:26,540
to look scarier than they are, right? Yeah. I'd like to remind you before we listen to this clip

1476
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:31,660
that Alex spent most of the first hour of the show talking grotesquely about how his

1477
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:40,300
imaginary enemies, uh, uh, abuse and kill and eat children, uh, in ways that, uh, were so graphic

1478
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:45,980
and exploitative that I refuse to play them on our show. Yeah. I'm not defending white supremacists.

1479
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:50,700
So I've actually been around some of them. Uh, the average one though thinks they're a victim

1480
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:54,140
and thinks everybody's out to get them and actually is not what the media even says.

1481
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:57,900
I'm not defending them, but I've talked to them. They actually believe something totally different

1482
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:01,500
as well. So it seems like what we're hearing about each group is not actually what's going

1483
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:06,300
on. No. Yeah. Because they, they, they intentionally want everyone to look scarier

1484
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:10,300
and more dangerous and more evil than they actually are. They don't, they don't want,

1485
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:15,420
you know, because before, if you go back, it's very much kind of like to kill a Mockingbird

1486
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:19,020
bird. And you know, the whole thing with boo Radley of, they just want to take someone who

1487
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:23,820
might be a little weird or might be wrong. And they want to make them look like a demon. They

1488
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:27,420
wanted to make them look like a devil. The answer to ending what we wouldn't,

1489
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:32,540
can we get Boogalooz malicious, the KKK and black lives matter all at a barbecue.

1490
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:36,780
And I would guess at the end of it, most people will be friends. You got to still people trying

1491
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:42,300
to start a fight. I would guess that they would not necessarily, uh, be friends. Yeah.

1492
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:49,820
Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. I think we just proved karma isn't real. Huh? I don't think there's a God. I

1493
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:54,780
don't think there's any punishment or retribution or justice in the universe because those two guys

1494
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:59,660
are allowed to speak on air. Well, there's a part of me that really sincerely wonders as I listen

1495
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:07,900
to this, um, if Magnus wasn't saying these things as a sort of pointed thing to Alex.

1496
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:13,820
Yeah. Like there was a, there was a part of me that wondered if like he knew that this is what

1497
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:21,900
Alex does and was saying it for that purpose. It's, it, it's weird because these two guests,

1498
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:27,500
Magnus and Steve are both manipulating the shit out of Alex. Oh yeah. And using techniques that

1499
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:32,620
Alex can't really respond to. He doesn't have the wherewithal. No. And it's interesting to see like

1500
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:38,860
the old generation and then the new generation, uh, just abusing Alex's. Fuck over this dum-dum,

1501
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:46,700
ugh. Use him for all he's worth. What an idiot. So there is a, um, a, uh, Antifa member, uh,

1502
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:53,100
who's going by a pseudonym. Sure. On, uh, along with, uh, with, uh, uh, uh, Magnus.

1503
01:20:53,740 --> 01:21:00,940
Anti-fascist. And I don't, I don't care. No. I don't really care. I agree. What, uh, what?

1504
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:08,860
No, actually I just listened to a boogaloo boy lie to my face, uh, even though I know in his heart

1505
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:12,860
he wants to see me bleed to death. So I really don't care what the person sitting next to him

1506
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:17,900
says either. Yeah, I, I don't, uh, I don't, I'm not particularly interested. I don't know who this

1507
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:22,300
person is. They're using a fake name. They're wearing a mask when they're talking. Um. Oh,

1508
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:26,060
well then it doesn't mean anything at all. But, and the stuff that they're saying is like really

1509
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:29,820
not very controversial and it doesn't start a fight. It's just like, yeah, we're against

1510
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:34,700
corporate, uh, governor, like corporate, world corporations. I'm like, all right, whatever.

1511
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:41,420
It's, it's very mild and, uh, Alex doesn't really like take issue with much. I don't know. It was

1512
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:47,020
disappointing much like the Steve interview. And so here's Alex's final suggestion. I would love

1513
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:50,540
to see Antifa and the Proud Boys have a summit together. My God, I'd have 50 million views

1514
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:56,460
online. Big Tech let it out there. It actually just end all this stupidity. This cuts to the

1515
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:02,220
heart of so much of Alex's politics being meaningless and empty. He would love to see a

1516
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:06,700
summit between the Proud Boys and Antifa because he thinks it would go viral.

1517
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:12,700
How long, what month is it? March, February. February. What year is it? 2021.

1518
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:16,700
No, no, no. I won that one. No, you said it before I finished 2021. That's true. You're right.

1519
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:23,820
Damn it. And how long ago did violent fascists try to overthrow the United States government?

1520
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:30,220
It's a couple of weeks. Okay. Now I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the people on the

1521
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:34,060
right who are saying, well, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the people on the right,

1522
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:39,500
who are saying we should have summits are doing that more for their benefit than ours.

1523
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:44,620
Yeah, probably. I'm going to go with that. But even beyond that, Alex can only see this through

1524
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:50,140
the lens of like, what would be attention grabbing? Totally. Totally. Steve, let's get you

1525
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:55,340
to do a show with David Knight. Not because that would bring anything to the world, not because we

1526
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:59,980
would get any greater understanding or information out of that dynamic, but because you guys would

1527
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:04,700
fight and it would draw attention. Yeah. Yeah, it'd be great. Everybody'd love it. I saw this

1528
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:09,100
Boogaloo Boy guy get interviewed on Jimmy Dore's show. It got a lot of attention. So I reached out

1529
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:13,260
to him because I wanted some of that attention. Right. See, personally, I have always thought

1530
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:20,700
that the best form of governance would happen in the WWE writers room. So naturally I assumed that

1531
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:25,180
that's a dictatorship. No, no, no, no. See, what happens is the government should be a

1532
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:32,220
giant spectacle that never accomplishes anything and resets to new narratives every now and again.

1533
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:36,620
But I don't think that's what the WWE writers room is like. I think it's Vincent McMahon

1534
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:42,460
hitting everyone over the head with a stick and saying, no, no. Oh, so that would be very similar

1535
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:46,780
to what it is that happened when the professional wrestling took over the government. Somewhat.

1536
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:53,820
Yeah. So we've come to the end and I feel disappointed in everybody. I think

1537
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:59,580
I feel disappointed in everybody. Yeah. I feel disappointed in life. I'm disappointed in everyone but you

1538
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:03,980
and our audience. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And maybe a few select people in the world. But everybody that I'm

1539
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:11,500
looking at here, a random Antifa person, quote, unquote, Magnus, Alex, Steve Pechenik. The only

1540
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:14,940
person I don't feel all that bad about is Steve Pechenik's wife. That's because I don't know

1541
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:18,540
anything about her and all I do is hear her laugh when Alex says something shitty. Yeah, she seems to be having a great time.

1542
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:22,380
Yeah. She seems to be enjoying the shit out of this. I'm sure if I knew anything about her,

1543
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:27,340
I would have some issues. She's just there for the company. You know, when you get older,

1544
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:33,980
you just like being around somebody. You don't want to live alone. Yeah. So I just wanted more.

1545
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:42,460
But you know, you get what you get. I want an apology. I would like an apology. I feel like

1546
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:46,300
that's not unreasonable to ask. I don't think it's unreasonable but I don't think you're ever

1547
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:52,700
going to get it because we have entered like an even, the thing that's, it's not even

1548
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:58,620
disappointment, it's disorientation, because I think on some level this represents a new level

1549
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:03,660
of not reality we're living in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, this is beyond not reality. This is creating a not

1550
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:09,100
reality on top of the not reality that didn't happen. There's a not reality to Infowars and

1551
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:14,620
Alex Jones's narratives about the world and it's one thing to kind of like see like, ah, this is

1552
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:20,540
Alex trying to maintain that not reality. Now you have Steve introducing this secondary layer of

1553
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:26,380
non-reality on top of Alex's non-reality and it's, it's disorienting and you would think that Alex

1554
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:32,780
would want to fight to maintain control of his non-reality, but he doesn't, he doesn't seem able

1555
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:39,100
to. Nope. It's weird. Yeah, I would, I think I, that's actually my new position. My new and major

1556
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:45,500
position, I will absolutely reach out across the aisle when I get an apology. I would like, I

1557
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:51,100
would be happy to, I'd be happy to do that. Yeah, I mean, I don't, I think that most people would.

1558
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:57,740
Yeah, I would like a direct apology and from every individual. Oh, well that might be. And then I will

1559
01:25:57,740 --> 01:26:02,220
reach out across the aisle to that single individual. That might be tough. I don't think you're gonna get

1560
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:06,220
that. I would like one. But you know what, the audience is gonna get another episode next time.

1561
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:11,100
Nice transition. But until then, we have a website. We do have a website, it's knowledgefight.com.

1562
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:14,060
We're also on Twitter. We are on Twitter, it's at knowledgefight.net, go to Ben Jordan.

1563
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:18,300
We're also on Facebook. We are on Facebook, iTunes. If you could please find a local charity or

1564
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:22,060
bail fund in your area to help out those doing God's work. Yeah, we'll be back. But until then,

1565
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:27,020
I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX, Clark, I'm Daryl Rundis, I'm the guy who's in charge of telling

1566
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:31,820
Alex when his collar's up. I fucked up, I got fired. Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks

1567
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:38,140
for holding. Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan. I love your work. I love you.
