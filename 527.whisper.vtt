00:12.960 --> 00:19.600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.200
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:25.200 --> 00:29.360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.600
Knowledgefight Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight

Riddleware, riddleware, riddleware, riddleware Riddleware, riddleware, riddleware

00:38.660 --> 00:40.820
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and Stop it.

00:40.820 --> 00:46.500
Andy and, Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and, it's time to pray.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.360
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

00:48.360 --> 00:49.880
Thanks for holding us.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.120
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.720
I'm a huge fan, I love your word.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.820
Knowledgefight, n-n-n-n-n-Knowledgefight.com I love you.

00:56.820 --> 01:26.820
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight. I'm Dan. I'm Jordan. We're a couple dudes that like to sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones. Oh, indeed we are, Dan. Jordan. Dan! What's up? Quick question for you. Yeah. What's your bright spot today? My bright spot today, Jordan, comes in the form of a cereal. I decided that, okay, so I was making some choices on cereal, right? I'm sitting there looking at these boxes. Yeah. And I see one that is a Dunkin' Donuts flavor. No. Mocha. No. Mocha. No. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha. Mocha.

01:26.820 --> 01:33.620
Coffee refuse cereal. Pass. Hard pass. I stared at it. I throw a spear at that box. I stared at it

01:33.620 --> 01:40.100
for a while because it was like, well, I'm drawn in. But there's another voice that was telling me,

01:40.900 --> 01:45.860
is this the novelty that's going to get you burned? Right. Is this too novel? Right. Right.

01:45.860 --> 01:50.820
Right. Honestly, there was also one, there was a Carmel Macchiato and I said, that looks gross.

01:50.820 --> 01:56.420
That is definitely going to burn me. I do appreciate finding where your limits are.

01:56.420 --> 02:03.220
It's right between those two. Exactly. We found that certain perfect gray zone.

02:03.220 --> 02:09.300
Carmel Macchiato is too far. That's the Mendoza line, as they say. Yes, absolutely.

02:09.300 --> 02:16.900
Shout out to Marty. Yeah. I got it. It's great. It's really good. It's great. Of course it is.

02:16.900 --> 02:20.500
It's shockingly good. What does it taste like, a donut? No, it tastes like coffee.

02:20.500 --> 02:23.860
It tastes like coffee. It tastes like a mocha coffee. Oh, I thought they were going to taste

02:23.860 --> 02:30.260
like a donut type thing. No, and it's got like, basically the texture of it is there's like little

02:30.260 --> 02:36.020
marshmallows and then the cereal itself is basically just like Cocoa Puffs. Oh, okay.

02:36.020 --> 02:42.180
It's just, I don't know. I mean, it's not good. It's not good for you. It's not great. It's just,

02:42.180 --> 02:47.300
I expected it to be a real dangerous proposition. It turned out to be great. I enjoyed it. I

02:47.300 --> 02:52.740
recommend it. I imagine Dunkin Donuts probably won't release a cereal based on my coffee flavor,

02:52.740 --> 03:01.860
which is black. Just a burnt flavored. Yeah, burnt, black, a whole pot of it too.

03:01.860 --> 03:04.500
Yeah, a post is going to come out with a Folgers.

03:07.140 --> 03:12.660
No cream. I don't foresee that happening. Are you sick of drinking coffee? Chew it!

03:12.660 --> 03:17.220
This introduces an actual interesting problem. What's that? That is that if you have a black

03:17.220 --> 03:21.700
coffee flavored cereal, do you have milk in it? What do I drink with it? Yes.

03:21.700 --> 03:24.660
Do you put milk in or is that ruined? I do not. You can't. It ruins the cereal.

03:24.660 --> 03:26.740
So do you pour coffee in there? Absolutely.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.940
Okay. What else would you drink? Double brewed.

03:29.940 --> 03:32.820
Silly. Yes. That's a red eye.

03:32.820 --> 03:35.860
Yeah. That sounds right.

03:35.860 --> 03:41.780
So what about you? What's your bright spot? My bright spot, Dan, is the new album by Madlib,

03:41.780 --> 03:44.820
Sound Ancestors. Very, very good. Okay.

03:44.820 --> 03:50.740
Very, very good. It's all music that was made by Madlib over the span of

03:50.740 --> 03:54.980
like the past two years. You know Madlib, right? Yeah.

03:54.980 --> 03:59.300
You know how all he does is just sit around and make music all the time?

03:59.300 --> 04:03.780
I got that sense. Yeah. I mean, I don't know him personally, but yeah, it seems like he likes music.

04:03.780 --> 04:07.860
He's one of my heroes just because he's like one of those guys who's just like,

04:07.860 --> 04:12.340
I know what I do and I make music and everything else can go fuck off.

04:12.340 --> 04:15.540
Yeah. That's basically like me and looking at Alex Jones.

04:15.540 --> 04:19.540
And you see now why I'm drawn to you and people of your ilk.

04:19.540 --> 04:21.060
Weird committed people. Yes.

04:21.940 --> 04:23.540
Absolutely. Because I'm a little lazy.

04:27.540 --> 04:31.460
You're fine. Anyways, it was arranged by Fortet and it's really, really,

04:31.460 --> 04:33.220
really, really good. I love it so much. Awesome.

04:33.220 --> 04:34.260
Yeah. Absolutely.

04:34.260 --> 04:38.580
I'll have to give that a spin. I've been getting back on the bike a little bit and

04:39.220 --> 04:42.740
I've been needing some more music to throw into the rotation.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.380
Toss it in there. I've been listening to a lot of Polish Ambassador.

04:45.380 --> 04:48.980
Okay. Well. I enjoy the Polish Ambassador.

04:48.980 --> 04:52.900
It will be a departure of style. I will say that.

04:52.900 --> 04:53.860
Maybe less than you think.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.300
I don't know. We'll see.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.140
Have you ever heard of the Polish Ambassador?

04:58.260 --> 05:02.980
I have heard of him. I haven't listened to that in a while.

05:02.980 --> 05:07.300
I enjoy, there's an album called, I don't even remember.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.580
How old is that again?

05:08.580 --> 05:09.220
Huh?

05:09.220 --> 05:10.420
What album are you talking about?

05:10.420 --> 05:15.220
Let me actually pull it up here because I forget names of things really easily.

05:15.220 --> 05:20.740
You know, it's like within the last five years or so, some of these albums.

05:20.740 --> 05:27.780
The one I was listening to is him and Ayla Nerio. She's a singer, like a vocalist.

05:27.780 --> 05:32.100
They have a group called Wild Light and they have an album called The Tide that

05:32.100 --> 05:36.020
I was listening to that's really, it's good for, you know, a little bit of riding the bike,

05:36.020 --> 05:38.660
cardio stuff, but I'll check out that Madlib album too.

05:38.660 --> 05:39.140
I'll check it out.

05:39.140 --> 05:42.420
Because otherwise I'm just going to end up drifting back to Carly Rae Jepsen.

05:42.420 --> 05:42.900
Yeah, yeah.

05:42.900 --> 05:44.980
Look, there's nothing wrong with mixing in a little bit of that.

05:44.980 --> 05:48.180
But if you start riding your bike and listening to Ska,

05:48.180 --> 05:49.460
I'm never going to hear the end of it.

05:49.460 --> 05:50.820
It's going to be trouble.

05:50.820 --> 05:56.260
I generally, if I have that feeling, I only listen to the Sami Zayn intro music,

05:56.260 --> 05:57.060
because that's great.

05:58.980 --> 06:03.140
And then also Christian Ska, like Five Iron Frenzy or the OC Supertones.

06:04.020 --> 06:06.740
Because those have like a sentimental thing to them too.

06:06.740 --> 06:10.740
I will rarely ever listen to other Ska stuff on the bike.

06:10.740 --> 06:15.940
If you listen to Christian Ska backwards, is that like running away from God?

06:15.940 --> 06:17.620
Or how does that work?

06:17.620 --> 06:18.020
Sure.

06:18.020 --> 06:18.340
Yeah?

06:18.340 --> 06:18.660
Yeah.

06:18.660 --> 06:18.900
Okay.

06:18.900 --> 06:19.540
I'll give it to you.

06:19.540 --> 06:20.020
Okay, fair.

06:20.020 --> 06:22.260
So Jordan, today we have an interesting episode to go over.

06:22.260 --> 06:24.100
We're going to be talking about February 4th, 2021.

06:24.100 --> 06:24.500
Blackjack!

06:24.500 --> 06:24.820
Blackjack!

06:24.820 --> 06:25.940
Oh, damn it!

06:25.940 --> 06:26.340
So close.

06:26.340 --> 06:28.420
I was ready for it too.

06:28.420 --> 06:29.380
I was ready for it.

06:29.380 --> 06:30.260
I'm so lazy.

06:32.020 --> 06:36.740
Got some interesting stuff happening on this episode that requires our attention.

06:36.740 --> 06:41.540
Uh, this is Thursday's episode, so, you know, it's right hot off the presses.

06:41.540 --> 06:42.420
Yes, indeed.

06:42.420 --> 06:44.660
And I had an interesting ride to get here.

06:44.660 --> 06:47.140
And we'll talk about that as we start the episode.

06:47.140 --> 06:50.180
But first, let's give a little bit of a shout out to the folks who have signed up and are

06:50.180 --> 06:51.140
supporting the show.

06:51.140 --> 06:53.060
So first, Villain Jack, thank you so much.

06:53.060 --> 06:54.500
You are now a policy wonk.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.540
I'm a policy wonk.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.580
Thanks, Villain Jack!

06:56.580 --> 06:57.060
Thank you.

06:57.060 --> 06:58.500
Next, Long Winded, thank you so much.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.860
You are now a policy wonk.

06:59.860 --> 07:00.980
I'm a policy wonk.

07:00.980 --> 07:02.020
Thank you very much.

07:02.020 --> 07:02.820
Long Winded.

07:02.820 --> 07:06.020
I feel a spiritual connection with anybody whose alias is named Long Winded.

07:06.020 --> 07:11.140
Since I've been accused of being someone who uses about 15 times the words they need.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.820
No, you're an orator, sir.

07:12.820 --> 07:13.380
You're not Long Winded.

07:13.380 --> 07:14.820
That's a polite way of saying it.

07:14.820 --> 07:17.780
Next, I Guess Murder Hornets Were Just a Filler episode.

07:17.780 --> 07:19.140
You are now a policy wonk.

07:19.140 --> 07:20.420
I'm a policy wonk.

07:20.420 --> 07:20.900
That's a good point.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.020
Thank you very much, yeah.

07:22.020 --> 07:24.100
Next, I'm Camry and I submit to the globalists.

07:24.100 --> 07:24.580
Thank you so much.

07:24.580 --> 07:25.620
You are now a policy wonk.

07:25.620 --> 07:26.740
I'm a policy wonk.

07:26.740 --> 07:27.940
Thank you very much, Camry!

07:28.660 --> 07:29.860
Next, Shmoo is Q.

07:29.860 --> 07:30.420
Thank you so much.

07:30.420 --> 07:31.780
You are now a policy wonk.

07:31.780 --> 07:32.740
I'm a policy wonk.

07:32.740 --> 07:33.620
We've solved the mystery.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.420
We figured it out.

07:34.420 --> 07:35.220
It's Shmoo.

07:35.220 --> 07:37.940
Then finally, let's say thank you to a couple of people who donated on elevated level.

07:37.940 --> 07:38.980
We appreciate that very much.

07:38.980 --> 07:41.220
So first is a sandwich, all one word.

07:41.220 --> 07:41.700
Thank you so much.

07:41.700 --> 07:42.900
You're now a technocrat.

07:42.900 --> 07:44.740
And take my money, you filthy animals.

07:44.740 --> 07:45.300
Thank you so much.

07:45.300 --> 07:46.740
You are now a technocrat.

07:46.740 --> 07:48.020
I'm a policy wonk.

07:48.020 --> 07:48.740
Crikey, mate.

07:48.740 --> 07:49.700
That's fantastic.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.060
Have yourself a brew.

07:51.060 --> 07:52.660
How's your 401k doing, bro?

07:52.660 --> 07:55.300
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

07:55.300 --> 07:56.500
Let's just get down to business.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.580
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

07:58.580 --> 07:59.940
Why are you pimps so good?

08:00.580 --> 08:02.260
My neck is freakishly large.

08:02.260 --> 08:04.820
I declare info war on you.

08:04.820 --> 08:06.340
Thank you all so much.

08:06.340 --> 08:06.900
Yes, thank you very much.

08:06.900 --> 08:12.260
I like the is a sandwich name, too, because I've gotten into some aggressive arguments

08:12.260 --> 08:15.300
in my time about whether things are or are not sandwiches.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.620
Yeah, I've heard of people doing that.

08:17.620 --> 08:22.420
And it disconcerts me that people would have strong feelings about sandwiches.

08:22.420 --> 08:29.140
Well, it really introduces a philosophical question about what does constitute a sandwich.

08:29.140 --> 08:29.540
Right.

08:29.540 --> 08:33.620
Hot dog is a classic thing that will cause people to come to loggerheads.

08:33.620 --> 08:36.340
Sure, it is a divisive topic.

08:37.060 --> 08:40.820
But once you start talking about that, you enter the world of taco.

08:40.820 --> 08:41.700
Is a taco a sandwich?

08:41.700 --> 08:42.340
Oh, my God.

08:42.340 --> 08:42.740
I know.

08:42.740 --> 08:43.540
See, that's what I'm saying.

08:43.540 --> 08:44.180
Oh, no.

08:44.180 --> 08:48.500
Once you start getting into that, it's dangerous.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.460
It's a slippery slope.

08:49.460 --> 08:55.700
I only trust the word of the Earl himself, and he has not spoken regarding hot dogs.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.180
So I say that it's fine or it's not fine.

08:58.180 --> 09:00.180
It does not matter until he speaks.

09:00.180 --> 09:02.180
All right, well, we will go with that.

09:02.180 --> 09:02.660
Yeah.

09:02.660 --> 09:06.340
So, Jordan, today, this episode, like I said, we're doing February 4th.

09:06.340 --> 09:15.140
And my path to this was a challenge because I was trying to get myself really motivated

09:15.140 --> 09:18.740
to talk about Alex on Monday.

09:18.740 --> 09:21.700
From Monday, we're going to cover the week.

09:21.700 --> 09:23.620
And then he started talking like this.

09:23.620 --> 09:24.660
I can't handle it.

09:24.660 --> 09:25.620
I just can't handle it.

09:26.260 --> 09:29.380
And it's global government and China's open for business.

09:29.380 --> 09:42.660
It's designed to transfer all of the all of the resources and jobs overseas.

09:43.380 --> 09:45.620
And the public's got to go into a conscious mode.

09:45.620 --> 09:49.700
Everybody gets really unconscious, just kind of accepts what's coming at them.

09:49.700 --> 09:50.660
Like, I'm not mad at the crew.

09:51.460 --> 09:52.180
I love them to death.

09:52.180 --> 09:57.300
But I said, if my call was ever sticking up, you got to tell me on air, open your eyes,

09:57.300 --> 09:58.580
look for problems.

09:58.580 --> 10:00.180
I got a booger hanging out of my nose.

10:00.180 --> 10:00.580
Tell me.

10:00.580 --> 10:01.220
But they won't do it.

10:01.220 --> 10:02.020
They're good people.

10:02.020 --> 10:03.380
They're just in a trance.

10:03.380 --> 10:05.060
Eye collar was sticking straight up.

10:05.060 --> 10:06.100
See, I'm not mad at them.

10:06.100 --> 10:06.980
It's a teaching moment.

10:06.980 --> 10:09.540
The globalists are coming with deadly vaccines that don't work.

10:09.540 --> 10:10.580
Permanent lockdowns.

10:10.580 --> 10:12.100
Everybody's just kind of taking it.

10:12.100 --> 10:13.540
They're just kind of taking it.

10:13.540 --> 10:14.420
Can't take it anymore.

10:14.420 --> 10:15.940
You got to get the conscious mode.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.940
See, when you're not conscious, you're basically dying.

10:17.940 --> 10:18.900
And your collar's up.

10:19.540 --> 10:21.380
Yeah, I was listening to that.

10:21.380 --> 10:22.100
Wow.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.540
This is so dumb.

10:24.260 --> 10:25.060
Okay.

10:25.060 --> 10:28.580
He's basically having an HR meeting where he's scolding the crew for not telling him

10:28.580 --> 10:29.620
that his collar was up.

10:29.620 --> 10:33.780
But in the guise of talking about how when you're unconscious, the globalist can pull

10:33.780 --> 10:34.100
stuff off.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.620
It does seem like he's turning what is a very petty.

10:38.820 --> 10:41.780
You guys should know I am incapable of basic hygiene.

10:41.780 --> 10:42.180
Yeah.

10:42.180 --> 10:43.220
And take care of me.

10:43.220 --> 10:44.100
Tell them.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.700
Into a global problem.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.540
Talk to your staff during the breaks.

10:47.540 --> 10:50.020
Make your points on air.

10:50.020 --> 10:51.060
I just was listening to that.

10:51.060 --> 10:52.260
Like, this is so stupid.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.220
I can't even.

10:53.220 --> 10:53.700
Wild.

10:53.700 --> 10:56.340
Yeah, it felt like walking through knee deep mud.

10:56.340 --> 10:57.300
Listen to this shit.

10:57.300 --> 10:58.180
I don't need it.

10:58.180 --> 11:07.220
And so I decided, you know, like, maybe I'll go and try to find some Project Camelot stuff

11:07.220 --> 11:08.100
to take a break with.

11:08.100 --> 11:08.980
No good.

11:08.980 --> 11:09.620
Not great.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.700
So we decided we're going to do a time travel episode.

11:11.700 --> 11:12.820
Go back to the past.

11:12.820 --> 11:15.060
At our now daily morning meetings.

11:15.060 --> 11:21.140
I listened to an episode from 2011, and I found Alex trying to get really excited about

11:21.140 --> 11:24.180
Bilderberg, and it made sense. Everything checked out.

11:27.620 --> 11:33.380
He was really excited about this Swiss Holocaust denier that he didn't realize was a Holocaust

11:33.380 --> 11:34.180
denier.

11:34.180 --> 11:35.060
It was a lot of fun.

11:35.060 --> 11:36.100
We're going to have fun with that.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.620
But then the bat signal went off.

11:37.620 --> 11:38.420
Oh, I know.

11:38.420 --> 11:39.940
Jordan, the bat signal.

11:39.940 --> 11:40.500
I heard.

11:42.100 --> 11:44.580
It's Thursday, February 4th of the year.

11:44.580 --> 11:45.940
It's 2021.

11:45.940 --> 11:48.180
Dr. Steve Pucinek is going to face the music.

11:48.180 --> 11:49.140
We really appreciate him.

11:49.140 --> 11:50.420
He has a lot of courage.

11:50.420 --> 11:52.260
Coming up in hour number two.

11:53.220 --> 11:54.340
Stay with us.

11:54.340 --> 11:56.500
That is catnip.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.020
Yeah, there's nothing we can do.

11:58.020 --> 11:58.520
Nope.

11:59.060 --> 12:03.380
There are certain times in doing this show where you just got to resign yourself to like,

12:03.380 --> 12:05.220
well, here's what happens.

12:05.220 --> 12:05.780
Yep.

12:05.780 --> 12:12.100
Steve's back on after saying Trump will still be president after January 20th or I'll eat

12:12.100 --> 12:13.060
my hat, essentially.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.980
If he's not president, then I'll never come on your show again.

12:16.980 --> 12:18.900
If I am, you got to hire me, right?

12:18.900 --> 12:22.020
You know, so no one is happy.

12:24.340 --> 12:26.020
I was interested.

12:26.020 --> 12:28.260
Yes, I too am.

12:28.260 --> 12:31.060
I'm interested to see what kind of big swing is going on here.

12:31.060 --> 12:36.260
Steve is a lunatic and yeah, I don't know, man.

12:36.260 --> 12:38.020
You just never know what to expect.

12:38.020 --> 12:42.340
And this I'm hoping for a double down.

12:42.340 --> 12:48.020
I'm hoping for him to come right out and say Trump is still president.

12:48.020 --> 12:49.220
Huh?

12:49.220 --> 12:50.500
That would be a swing.

12:50.500 --> 12:54.660
I'm going to say completely unrelated to what you want.

12:54.660 --> 12:55.060
Sure.

12:55.060 --> 12:57.620
Don't take this as a sign whether that is or is not going to happen.

12:57.620 --> 12:58.100
Okay.

12:58.100 --> 13:03.940
I'll say that I was a little underwhelmed by this interview on both of their parts.

13:03.940 --> 13:08.100
I was a little underwhelmed by Alex and by Steve, although there is some hilarious stuff

13:08.100 --> 13:10.900
that happens, but the two of them should have been screaming at each other.

13:10.900 --> 13:11.540
Absolutely.

13:11.540 --> 13:17.140
This should have been a knockdown drag out fucking you have been lying to me since the

13:17.140 --> 13:21.300
beginning and then Stevie P has been like, of course I've been lying to you.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.180
You're a moron.

13:22.180 --> 13:24.660
It's nuts that Steve agreed to do it.

13:24.660 --> 13:25.540
Oh, of course he did.

13:25.540 --> 13:26.740
He doesn't give a fuck.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.740
He does not give one fuck.

13:28.740 --> 13:32.100
It's nuts that Alex clearly doesn't have more of a plan.

13:32.100 --> 13:36.420
That is obvious, expected, and still insane.

13:36.420 --> 13:37.300
It's just outrageous.

13:37.300 --> 13:37.860
Yeah.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.020
So Alex, that's in the second hour.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.260
He's got to get to some other news in the first hour.

13:42.260 --> 13:42.820
Sure.

13:42.820 --> 13:43.860
But see, these are liars.

13:43.860 --> 13:48.020
In a moment, I'm going to show you AOC caught in the lie we talked about a few days ago.

13:48.020 --> 13:50.660
I said, wait a minute, look up where her office is.

13:51.380 --> 13:53.060
She's a junior member of the house.

13:53.780 --> 13:56.900
And I've actually been there while she was a Congresswoman and saw her scurrying around

13:56.900 --> 13:58.660
the halls about a year and a half ago.

14:00.020 --> 14:02.260
She wasn't even in the damn Capitol.

14:04.420 --> 14:07.940
I mean, I mean, I know we talked about a few days ago, but now it's even on Fox news.

14:07.940 --> 14:10.580
This woman is a congenital liar.

14:12.340 --> 14:13.540
We're going to get to that here in a moment.

14:13.540 --> 14:19.380
But first, my dad launched a new company about a year and a half ago and developed his own

14:19.380 --> 14:20.500
amazing toothpaste.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.700
Ooh, wild.

14:21.700 --> 14:22.180
Good stuff.

14:22.180 --> 14:22.420
Good.

14:22.420 --> 14:22.980
All right.

14:22.980 --> 14:23.300
Hey.

14:24.180 --> 14:27.300
She didn't claim to have been in the Capitol building.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.860
That her building itself was also evacuated.

14:31.060 --> 14:33.060
I just, I don't know.

14:33.060 --> 14:38.740
I understand that the right wing really desperately needs to try and minimize the human trauma

14:38.740 --> 14:43.860
that was experienced by the people who were the victims of the consequences of their rhetoric.

14:43.860 --> 14:44.500
Sure.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.140
We tried to get you guys murdered, but you're lying about it.

14:47.140 --> 14:47.380
Yeah.

14:47.380 --> 14:51.380
I understand why people like Candace Owens and Jack Pessobic are really pushing these

14:51.380 --> 14:51.940
things hard.

14:51.940 --> 14:54.580
And Alex is now jumping on this as well.

14:54.580 --> 14:55.700
Like, I get it.

14:55.700 --> 14:57.060
It's just dumb.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.060
It's awful to see.

14:59.060 --> 15:03.860
Like, denying her her experiences is just...

15:03.860 --> 15:07.540
Yeah, no, it's one of the more fucked up things I can think of.

15:07.540 --> 15:15.540
I, like, if I, from an empathetic position, if I put myself in their shoes, I imagine

15:15.540 --> 15:20.180
I too would scramble because I would not want to reckon with the idea that I am essentially

15:20.180 --> 15:21.300
an attempted murder.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.180
Well, you gotta...

15:22.180 --> 15:22.420
You know?

15:22.980 --> 15:27.060
But I don't think that they have, I don't know, I think they're just basically psychopaths

15:27.060 --> 15:29.780
and they're like, well, this is what we got to do to protect the grift, not...

15:29.780 --> 15:30.260
The alternative...

15:30.260 --> 15:31.140
I don't care.

15:31.140 --> 15:33.380
They don't care if she was murdered.

15:33.380 --> 15:39.060
I think part of it is protecting the grift, but then also I think a part of it is, you

15:39.060 --> 15:44.180
know, it's something that is so essential to a lot of these narratives, is the inability

15:44.180 --> 15:47.140
or the desire not to feel bad about anything.

15:47.140 --> 15:48.100
Yeah, yeah.

15:48.100 --> 15:53.620
And that would penetrate that bubble pretty hard, recognizing that these are human consequences

15:54.180 --> 15:59.060
of these conspiracy theories and this bullshit that gets peddled.

15:59.060 --> 16:02.980
And to recognize that would probably introduce some bad feelings.

16:02.980 --> 16:03.220
Yeah.

16:03.220 --> 16:06.180
And, you know, that's not in their interest.

16:06.180 --> 16:07.220
No, that would hurt.

16:07.220 --> 16:07.540
Yeah.

16:07.540 --> 16:08.580
Yeah, they don't like that.

16:08.580 --> 16:15.300
So Alex does that AOC shit and then he flips into an ad and like he does an entire segment

16:15.300 --> 16:16.740
that's just ads.

16:16.740 --> 16:19.140
The entire second segment of the show is ads.

16:19.140 --> 16:19.780
Sure.

16:19.780 --> 16:21.700
And it's just unbelievable.

16:21.700 --> 16:25.540
Buy my dad's toothpaste so I can hide more money in his company.

16:25.540 --> 16:26.260
It's a drag!

16:26.260 --> 16:30.340
It almost feels like Alex thinks that announcing that Steve's gonna be on the show is gonna

16:30.340 --> 16:36.260
somehow boost ratings, and then he does an extended commercial to try and get the message

16:36.260 --> 16:37.620
out to as many people as he can.

16:37.620 --> 16:38.120
Could be.

16:38.980 --> 16:41.700
Then he gets back to teasing the Steve interview.

16:42.340 --> 16:46.900
And Dr. Steve Pacinek, we have the clip we'll play it here in a few minutes, has the courage

16:46.900 --> 16:52.260
to come back on the show after coming on for 19 years and saying about 95% of what he's

16:52.260 --> 16:57.780
predicted has come true, what he predicted here a month ago before January 20th did not

16:57.780 --> 17:02.420
come true, and he's gonna give us his take on it.

17:02.420 --> 17:03.940
I can't wait to talk to him.

17:03.940 --> 17:04.820
Can't wait.

17:04.820 --> 17:05.380
Can't wait.

17:06.660 --> 17:06.980
Man.

17:07.620 --> 17:10.820
But see, here's the thing that I take issue with with a comment like that.

17:10.820 --> 17:14.740
What Alex is doing is he's framing Steve's comments as predictions.

17:14.740 --> 17:15.140
Yeah.

17:15.140 --> 17:16.580
They shouldn't be predictions.

17:16.580 --> 17:18.260
No, he said he proved them.

17:18.260 --> 17:21.780
Yes, Steve's been saying he's involved in things.

17:21.780 --> 17:22.900
He's been saying he did it.

17:22.900 --> 17:23.380
Yeah.

17:23.380 --> 17:25.460
He's not predicting something will happen.

17:25.460 --> 17:26.500
He's doing it.

17:26.500 --> 17:31.540
Yeah, it would be a completely different show, and people wouldn't take it as seriously if

17:31.540 --> 17:33.460
you were just like, hey, I don't know anything.

17:33.460 --> 17:34.020
I'm just getting.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.180
Oh, here's what I think is gonna happen.

17:36.180 --> 17:40.500
No, Steve pretends that he's got, like, teams of intelligence agents in the field.

17:40.500 --> 17:40.660
Yeah.

17:40.660 --> 17:44.740
What's the point of having a guy who's an expert with all of his connections if you're

17:44.740 --> 17:46.740
just gonna ask him for random ass predictions?

17:46.740 --> 17:47.220
Yeah.

17:47.220 --> 17:53.780
When he says I'm involved in this shit, then your brain is like, oh, he must be talking

17:53.780 --> 17:54.660
about something.

17:54.660 --> 17:59.460
If he just says, I predict this is gonna happen, you can start to recognize, oh, his predictions

17:59.460 --> 18:00.740
have a terrible batting average.

18:00.740 --> 18:01.460
He's not doing well.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.940
I guess I won't take those predictions that seriously anymore.

18:03.940 --> 18:04.820
Might be a bad idea.

18:04.820 --> 18:11.300
Yeah, it's experienced completely different to a listener when you present it as like,

18:11.300 --> 18:12.180
I did this.

18:12.180 --> 18:15.060
I put QR codes on all the ballots.

18:15.940 --> 18:16.740
So insane.

18:16.740 --> 18:17.700
Blockchain.

18:17.700 --> 18:18.420
You know what?

18:18.420 --> 18:24.660
What I don't understand about Alex is that I feel like he's missing that golden opportunity

18:25.220 --> 18:33.860
of, like, when you can cut ties with one of these assholes, it's like getting rid of.

18:33.860 --> 18:38.100
It's like when you're playing Go Fish or Old Maid or whatever it is where you can like,

18:38.100 --> 18:41.620
oh, as I'm discarding this card, I am not losing a card.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.420
I am giving the bad thing away.

18:44.420 --> 18:49.380
You know, like, when you cut ties with the Stevie P's, you can throw so many bloated

18:49.380 --> 18:50.980
narratives on him.

18:50.980 --> 18:54.100
Like, just toss all the shit that you don't want anymore out.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.220
Steve did Sandy Hook.

18:55.220 --> 18:56.420
Exactly.

18:56.420 --> 18:58.260
Be like, no, no, that was all Steve's idea.

18:58.260 --> 18:59.780
Like, go all in.

19:00.420 --> 19:01.620
Land it all on him.

19:01.620 --> 19:02.260
Don't half ass it.

19:02.260 --> 19:04.740
And you wouldn't be lying for the most part.

19:04.740 --> 19:08.500
Steve did influence all these negative things.

19:08.500 --> 19:09.620
Yeah, absolutely.

19:09.620 --> 19:10.500
I don't know.

19:10.500 --> 19:16.660
I think that Steve, because of Alex, has built up his own organic fan base.

19:16.660 --> 19:19.060
And now that is a threat to Alex.

19:19.060 --> 19:24.820
But if he turns on Steve too hard, Steve's audience will turn on Alex.

19:24.820 --> 19:26.660
What a goddamn moron.

19:26.660 --> 19:26.900
Yep.

19:26.900 --> 19:30.180
They basically are just like pointing guns at each other.

19:30.180 --> 19:32.180
They're just sitting there like, all right, we're at an impasse.

19:32.820 --> 19:33.700
What do we do?

19:33.700 --> 19:34.180
Sir, sir!

19:34.180 --> 19:34.420
Yeah.

19:34.420 --> 19:36.020
And that seems to be a theme of Alex.

19:36.020 --> 19:40.980
Like, he just builds up these no-win situations with these lunatics.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.580
And then here we are.

19:42.580 --> 19:46.900
Is there a man who is more dedicated to hoisting himself upon his own petards?

19:47.620 --> 19:48.420
It seems to work.

19:48.420 --> 19:49.700
I mean, it's profitable.

19:49.700 --> 19:50.580
That's fair.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.260
Also, I forgot about this.

19:52.260 --> 19:56.820
I forgot we need to give a shout out to someone whose birthday it is.

19:56.820 --> 20:01.860
Alexis sent an email and told us that Sean is celebrating a birthday.

20:01.860 --> 20:02.820
Oh, happy birthday, Sean.

20:02.820 --> 20:06.100
And so, Sean, I just wanted to give you a little bit of a happy birthday.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.060
Happy birthday, Sean.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.220
Many more!

20:09.220 --> 20:10.420
Isn't that what they do?

20:10.420 --> 20:11.220
Birthdays?

20:11.220 --> 20:12.100
No, it is not.

20:12.100 --> 20:12.500
Okay.

20:12.500 --> 20:15.860
Nobody wishes you more birthdays than you would die sooner.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.580
No, they don't want you to have no more birthdays.

20:18.580 --> 20:20.420
Yeah, no, they want you to have no more birthdays.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.540
No, they want you to have more.

20:21.540 --> 20:22.420
A ton of them.

20:22.420 --> 20:25.460
But the more birthdays you have, the closer you are to death.

20:25.460 --> 20:28.260
But no, because if you have more, it's further off.

20:28.260 --> 20:29.620
Each one of them represents a year.

20:29.620 --> 20:34.020
Alright, but then you're just saying I want you to race closer and closer to your end.

20:34.020 --> 20:35.940
Jordan, you're literally making no sense.

20:36.740 --> 20:37.380
I'm sorry.

20:37.380 --> 20:38.420
And that's fitting.

20:38.420 --> 20:38.740
Okay.

20:38.740 --> 20:39.940
Because neither does Alex.

20:39.940 --> 20:40.440
Fair.

20:41.620 --> 20:41.780
He...

20:44.100 --> 20:45.540
Alright, here's the bottom line.

20:45.540 --> 20:46.580
Let's hear the bottom line.

20:46.580 --> 20:52.500
Most of the first hour is spent with Alex talking disgustingly and grotesquely about child abuse.

20:52.500 --> 20:55.300
And we're not going to listen to any of that.

20:55.300 --> 20:55.620
Good.

20:55.620 --> 21:00.180
And I have my reasons for it, and if anybody takes issue with that,

21:00.180 --> 21:03.380
I will say that we've covered some of that stuff in the past.

21:03.380 --> 21:09.460
It doesn't add anything to demonstrate these things over and over again.

21:09.460 --> 21:12.660
And I believe that the way that Alex carries himself

21:12.660 --> 21:16.420
has the potential to be re-traumatizing to people.

21:16.420 --> 21:20.900
And I don't want to be a part of bringing that to our audience.

21:20.900 --> 21:26.740
And I want no part of it if you think that is an inappropriate decision on my part.

21:26.740 --> 21:29.300
I would encourage you to start your own Alex Jones podcast.

21:30.100 --> 21:30.740
We've had...

21:30.740 --> 21:33.700
How many times has he been on the show saying that shit?

21:33.700 --> 21:34.900
Go back and listen to it.

21:34.900 --> 21:36.260
He's saying the same shit.

21:36.260 --> 21:36.740
It happens a lot.

21:36.740 --> 21:37.780
And it's disgusting.

21:37.780 --> 21:38.980
Yeah, it happens a lot.

21:38.980 --> 21:42.340
And this was a particularly grotesque example of it.

21:42.900 --> 21:46.820
And I only have two clips that aren't actually about that,

21:46.820 --> 21:52.900
but are about little things that he's saying on the side of those conversations

21:52.900 --> 21:57.060
that are kind of stupid and maybe a little bit interesting.

21:57.060 --> 21:58.900
The first one is about cannibalism.

21:59.540 --> 22:04.420
There are a lot of currencies on the planet that the establishment operates under.

22:05.060 --> 22:06.020
There's cash.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.380
There's digital money.

22:07.380 --> 22:08.820
There's the derivatives.

22:08.820 --> 22:09.940
There's art.

22:09.940 --> 22:10.820
There's drugs.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.340
There's sex.

22:12.340 --> 22:13.380
There's information.

22:13.380 --> 22:18.660
And there is all sorts of weird, decadent pleasures.

22:18.660 --> 22:21.380
I mean, a big one is eating dead bodies.

22:22.260 --> 22:25.780
A lot of establishment people really like to eat human flesh.

22:25.780 --> 22:26.260
Sure.

22:26.820 --> 22:30.580
And they get them from morgues and stuff with dead kids and people.

22:30.580 --> 22:31.060
Naturally.

22:31.060 --> 22:32.820
And that's something that's well known.

22:32.820 --> 22:33.780
I've seen Blade.

22:33.780 --> 22:35.460
My dad told me all about this when I was a kid.

22:35.460 --> 22:36.980
Then later I saw it come out on the news.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.060
That's how I know this is nonsense.

22:39.060 --> 22:39.620
Wow.

22:39.620 --> 22:40.100
Yeah.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.780
Whenever you're Alex Jones and you're like,

22:41.780 --> 22:44.580
I'm a big, serious expert on the New World Order.

22:44.580 --> 22:46.900
My dad told me people get eaten.

22:47.860 --> 22:52.260
My dad said one time that a doctor ate a person.

22:52.260 --> 22:56.900
I would say that if you want to be taken seriously, don't say it that way.

22:56.900 --> 22:57.940
Don't.

22:59.940 --> 23:03.540
If you can prove these claims, you don't need to say my dad told me.

23:03.540 --> 23:09.380
When I was little, I discovered that while you were sleeping, if you had lost a tooth,

23:09.380 --> 23:13.860
someone will break into your home and brutally rip it from beneath your pillow.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.460
Will they leave something behind?

23:15.460 --> 23:18.580
I don't know, but I read it in the news later on in life.

23:18.580 --> 23:19.300
It's been confirmed.

23:19.300 --> 23:19.780
Yeah.

23:19.780 --> 23:20.180
Yeah.

23:20.180 --> 23:24.420
So Alex Jones's dad's scary bedtime story is not withstanding.

23:26.260 --> 23:30.260
Every detail, with the more we learn about his dad, the amount of-

23:30.260 --> 23:31.140
That dude is a fucked up dude.

23:31.140 --> 23:33.140
He fucked up Alex so bad.

23:33.140 --> 23:34.580
He's a fucked up dude.

23:34.580 --> 23:35.300
Yeah.

23:35.300 --> 23:45.060
So the other clip that Alex has here is, you know, whenever you, like, people get rich,

23:45.060 --> 23:48.660
they start to need more exciting things.

23:48.660 --> 23:54.020
The mundane pleasures of life sometimes are not what they...

23:54.020 --> 23:57.780
You know, they get rid of sports cars, they drive fast.

23:57.780 --> 23:59.460
Yeah, it's an escalation problem.

23:59.460 --> 24:02.740
The moment you've achieved your dream, now you have to find something else to achieve.

24:02.740 --> 24:03.220
Right.

24:03.220 --> 24:07.300
Alex discusses this a little bit, and I should tell you this, this is a family show.

24:08.180 --> 24:11.220
That's the type of stuff going on, where these people have all the money, all the power,

24:11.220 --> 24:13.220
and so they just do more and more degenerate stuff.

24:13.220 --> 24:18.100
I mean, it's very popular for establishment folks to just eat big bowls of fresh feces

24:18.100 --> 24:19.460
right out of a woman's rear end.

24:20.100 --> 24:22.500
And, you know, I'm not trying to be gross here, folks.

24:22.500 --> 24:26.980
I just want you to know what we're up against and what we're dealing with.

24:26.980 --> 24:27.540
Okay.

24:27.540 --> 24:28.340
All right, Alex.

24:28.340 --> 24:40.900
Okay, sure, fine, I don't know.

24:40.900 --> 24:44.660
Okay, so what do you...

24:44.660 --> 24:45.380
Here's what I saw.

24:45.940 --> 24:50.900
I saw Nancy Pelosi sitting at a desk much like ours, right?

24:50.900 --> 24:53.620
Like, you're fairly close to me.

24:53.620 --> 24:57.220
If you were to stand up, turn around, and just start shitting into a bowl,

24:57.220 --> 25:00.980
I could grab a spoon and just eat as you shit out of it.

25:00.980 --> 25:02.900
That's what I saw Nancy Pelosi doing.

25:02.900 --> 25:03.940
Is that what you...

25:03.940 --> 25:06.180
I didn't have any mental image except for Alex,

25:06.180 --> 25:09.460
just like his brain trying to be like, what can I say that's gross?

25:09.460 --> 25:10.500
Yeah, exactly.

25:11.060 --> 25:16.740
Like, I mean, look, humans are not good eating from a nutritional standpoint.

25:16.740 --> 25:19.140
It doesn't make sense for people to eat humans.

25:19.140 --> 25:19.780
No.

25:19.780 --> 25:23.780
And there's also nutritional issues with eating feces.

25:23.780 --> 25:28.580
I mean, both are great for just purely pleasurable things.

25:28.580 --> 25:31.620
It's like, no, no, no, sometimes I order Chinese food,

25:31.620 --> 25:34.580
and I know it's not maybe the most healthy decision,

25:34.580 --> 25:37.140
but it's about the pleasure of eating it, Dan.

25:37.140 --> 25:41.860
I imagine the same thing is true for eating shit coming out of a woman.

25:41.860 --> 25:45.700
That seems like a good way to get oral fecal transmitted conditions.

25:45.700 --> 25:46.980
Yeah, for the pleasure of it.

25:46.980 --> 25:52.180
Or, I mean, eating humans, there's a lot of conditions you can come down from with that.

25:52.180 --> 25:54.100
Well, they wash them first.

25:54.100 --> 25:54.980
Ah, okay, fine.

25:55.700 --> 25:56.740
Anyway, this is all stupid.

25:58.180 --> 26:00.740
Alex gets around to the Steve interview,

26:00.740 --> 26:04.740
and he's sort of easing into the introduction.

26:05.460 --> 26:10.340
Coming to you live from the ATX, broadcasting worldwide.

26:11.060 --> 26:15.140
I'm not going to try to rehabilitate Dr. Steve Pachinnik here on air in some people's eyes,

26:15.140 --> 26:20.020
but he did leave the CFR and say 9-11 was an inside job and called the real perpetrators out

26:20.020 --> 26:22.420
that were actually involved orchestrating it.

26:22.420 --> 26:24.100
I'm not saying radical Islam doesn't exist.

26:24.740 --> 26:25.940
And he's done a lot of other good things.

26:25.940 --> 26:28.980
Wasn't for the Syrian war, supported Trump, trying to get troops out.

26:29.700 --> 26:33.220
But I thought he was buying into the whole Q8-chan deal.

26:33.220 --> 26:35.540
Here is a problem for me.

26:35.540 --> 26:39.220
If you believe that he's an expert inside person,

26:39.220 --> 26:43.300
he should not be at all persuaded by Q stuff.

26:43.300 --> 26:47.300
If you have for a moment the inclination to think that Steve Pachinnik

26:47.300 --> 26:50.100
is getting influenced by stuff on a message board,

26:50.740 --> 26:55.380
you should very seriously question whether or not you should take anything he's saying seriously.

26:55.380 --> 26:58.180
He is supposed to be behind the scenes,

26:59.060 --> 27:03.700
which would be behind the psyop that you have argued Q must be.

27:05.060 --> 27:06.820
So how could someone behind the scenes,

27:06.820 --> 27:10.820
unless you're saying that he behind the scenes was tricked

27:10.820 --> 27:14.740
by the other behind the scenes people through Q,

27:14.740 --> 27:17.540
oh no, what are you doing letting him behind the scenes?

27:17.540 --> 27:19.860
If he's going to get tricked by other people behind the scenes,

27:19.860 --> 27:20.980
you stay behind the scenes.

27:20.980 --> 27:22.900
This psyop that I've started is too good.

27:22.900 --> 27:24.020
It's tricked even me.

27:24.020 --> 27:24.580
Exactly.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.140
Get the fuck out of here.

27:27.140 --> 27:30.420
So Alex is gracious and he thanks Steve for coming back.

27:30.420 --> 27:32.980
And my note on this is just like, why are they doing?

27:32.980 --> 27:33.540
Why?

27:33.540 --> 27:34.100
Yeah, why?

27:35.220 --> 27:38.180
And so I appreciate Steve Pachinnik coming on

27:38.900 --> 27:41.460
and having the courage after he was on.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.580
Well, let's punch that up.

27:42.580 --> 27:44.340
Is this Steve Pachinnik's last interview?

27:44.340 --> 27:45.860
Because I'll give you the date.

27:45.860 --> 27:46.820
I forget the date.

27:46.820 --> 27:47.140
Why?

27:47.140 --> 27:48.180
I just, I don't understand.

27:48.180 --> 27:50.260
This doesn't serve anyone's interests.

27:50.260 --> 27:54.500
Steve is going to have to go even further out on a limb

27:54.500 --> 27:58.580
in order to retain any sense of credibility at all.

27:58.580 --> 28:01.220
Alex is going to have to either confront somebody

28:01.220 --> 28:04.980
who he clearly doesn't have the fortitude to confront,

28:05.700 --> 28:11.620
or he's going to have to get persuaded by Steve to wait and see or whatever.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.700
This is a no win situation for anybody.

28:13.700 --> 28:14.100
No.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.020
Except for Steve, because he's got nothing to lose.

28:16.020 --> 28:16.520
Right.

28:17.460 --> 28:23.060
Alex's insistence on not preparing, coming through immediately with the,

28:23.060 --> 28:24.580
I don't even remember what date it was.

28:24.580 --> 28:25.620
Yeah, when was that shit?

28:26.580 --> 28:31.140
Promised me that the world would be, oh my God.

28:31.140 --> 28:31.460
Yeah.

28:31.460 --> 28:36.340
So I think Steve sucks and I think he's a real liar and a menace.

28:36.340 --> 28:43.540
Yeah, but that being said, I do think that the first question that Alex asks is unfair.

28:43.540 --> 28:43.780
Okay.

28:43.780 --> 28:45.060
I do think this is not the way.

28:45.060 --> 28:45.700
Even there.

28:45.700 --> 28:47.940
I do think this is not how you want to start an interview.

28:47.940 --> 28:48.440
Okay.

28:48.740 --> 28:52.660
So Steve Pacinek, tell us, was it all a big joke?

28:52.660 --> 28:53.940
Are you in with the Q guys?

28:53.940 --> 28:57.060
Were you part of the setup or were you really believing this was going to happen?

28:57.060 --> 28:58.180
We really appreciate you coming on.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.020
Number one, I enjoy coming on the show.

29:02.020 --> 29:10.340
Number two, what I do resent is the ad hominem comments coming from your disgusting viewers

29:10.340 --> 29:15.300
who think that I lied or in some way gave them false promises.

29:15.300 --> 29:17.940
Table turned on you in a second, Alex.

29:17.940 --> 29:19.140
Go fuck yourself.

29:19.140 --> 29:21.860
You don't get to do this.

29:21.860 --> 29:23.060
You do not.

29:23.060 --> 29:29.940
Alex tries to frame the interview with three options for Steve to pick that are all bad.

29:29.940 --> 29:31.860
Steve says, I like coming on your show.

29:31.860 --> 29:35.700
What I'd like to say is that your disgusting audience is a bunch of assholes who keep saying

29:35.700 --> 29:36.980
bad things about me.

29:36.980 --> 29:37.380
Wild.

29:38.340 --> 29:39.460
So pathetic.

29:39.460 --> 29:41.060
Yeah, Steve takes control.

29:41.060 --> 29:42.900
Alex has no shot.

29:42.900 --> 29:43.620
Just none.

29:43.620 --> 29:45.300
You can see it even immediately.

29:45.300 --> 29:48.820
Just like, no, it's not even in over your head.

29:48.820 --> 29:51.620
It's just you don't have the werewolf.

29:51.620 --> 29:54.180
Here's what you do whenever somebody does that.

29:54.180 --> 29:57.860
One, that is a shitty opening question, but also well deserved.

29:57.860 --> 29:59.060
Fuck you, Steve.

29:59.060 --> 30:04.420
And if Steve comes back with, I don't appreciate, you say, Hey, fuck you, Steve, you fucking

30:04.420 --> 30:04.900
lied.

30:04.900 --> 30:11.460
I would suggest that a better question is not like three possibilities that are all

30:11.460 --> 30:12.980
things he can't possibly accept.

30:12.980 --> 30:13.860
Right, of course.

30:13.860 --> 30:18.820
A more open ended question that is leading to the, what the fuck is wrong with you, man?

30:18.820 --> 30:19.460
Yes.

30:19.460 --> 30:21.140
That would be a better opening question.

30:21.140 --> 30:24.100
If you are wise, you will allow Steve to hang himself.

30:24.100 --> 30:24.420
Right.

30:24.420 --> 30:30.020
If you are someone who maybe prepares, you'd have a question that guides you towards where

30:30.020 --> 30:34.820
you want to go, as opposed to one that your person you're talking to can completely reject

30:34.820 --> 30:35.940
because it's a trap.

30:35.940 --> 30:36.440
Yeah.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.060
He doesn't, he just ignores it.

30:39.060 --> 30:46.340
No, I mean, of all the, of all the like so simple judo principles to be put into, to

30:46.340 --> 30:48.100
be demonstrated right here.

30:48.100 --> 30:53.300
Alex attacks with overwhelming force and Steve just gets out of the way.

30:53.300 --> 30:53.700
Yeah.

30:53.700 --> 30:54.660
And then not hard.

30:54.660 --> 30:59.220
And then once Alex's force has gone past him, he turns around and attacks them from the

30:59.220 --> 30:59.720
back.

31:00.260 --> 31:06.500
I came on the show again to basically say to you, I will double down on the military

31:06.500 --> 31:07.000
crew.

31:07.620 --> 31:14.500
And the reason I'm doubling down is that right now it's taking more time and I don't

31:14.500 --> 31:20.180
directly deal with military operatives as I had in the past when I went overseas.

31:20.180 --> 31:24.020
So I still have faith in my cyber command.

31:24.020 --> 31:26.500
I have faith in my special forces.

31:26.500 --> 31:28.100
I have faith in the generals.

31:28.980 --> 31:32.020
You don't have special forces teams.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.300
Oh, I was right.

31:33.300 --> 31:33.860
I was right.

31:33.860 --> 31:34.900
He did double down.

31:34.900 --> 31:35.140
Yeah.

31:35.140 --> 31:36.580
That is what I was expecting.

31:36.580 --> 31:37.060
Yeah.

31:37.060 --> 31:37.460
Yep.

31:37.460 --> 31:41.060
It's, uh, maybe not the, not the disappointing.

31:41.060 --> 31:41.560
Yeah.

31:41.940 --> 31:43.060
I wanted a bigger swing.

31:43.060 --> 31:43.460
Yeah.

31:43.460 --> 31:47.220
It's not, it's not as big a swing as you'd hope, but it is cool.

31:47.220 --> 31:50.260
I mean, like in terms of like, now what are you going to do, Alex?

31:50.260 --> 31:50.980
Yeah.

31:50.980 --> 31:51.480
Yeah.

31:51.700 --> 31:52.740
Steve was wrong.

31:52.740 --> 31:55.300
He came back and now he's telling you he was right.

31:55.300 --> 31:55.800
Yep.

31:58.100 --> 32:02.500
You almost could have predicted this coming seeing as how he has had no interest in whether

32:02.500 --> 32:05.380
or not reality conforms to his bullshit anyways.

32:05.380 --> 32:05.620
Yeah.

32:05.620 --> 32:08.180
Steve is absolutely gaslighting the shit out of you.

32:08.180 --> 32:13.300
Why would you imagine that he would become contrite and be like, oh, I'm sorry for lying

32:13.300 --> 32:13.540
to you.

32:13.540 --> 32:17.380
Also, you're not even getting to the under the underlying emotional problem, which is

32:17.380 --> 32:20.020
that he told you he has been using you.

32:20.580 --> 32:20.900
Yeah.

32:20.900 --> 32:21.140
Yeah.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.180
To your face.

32:22.180 --> 32:23.620
They don't get into that.

32:23.620 --> 32:24.580
Surprising.

32:24.580 --> 32:25.080
Yeah.

32:25.380 --> 32:28.660
So everything is going according to Trump's plan apparently.

32:28.660 --> 32:34.340
And only one person in the media really understands and gets this subtle thing that's going on.

32:34.340 --> 32:39.140
And that is the Trump is being quiet and maybe that's because he's got an impeachment trial

32:39.140 --> 32:41.060
coming up and he's been kicked off all social media.

32:41.060 --> 32:41.560
Could be.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.960
Uh, but one person gets it.

32:43.960 --> 32:44.360
Okay.

32:44.360 --> 32:47.400
This should piss off Alex, but I think he's distracted.

32:47.960 --> 32:54.040
So what I'm saying to you right now is what you're seeing happening is exactly what Trump

32:54.040 --> 32:55.000
wanted to happen.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.080
He's exposing.

32:57.080 --> 33:00.360
Now you got to remember one thing I've said about Trump.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.600
He never fails at what he does.

33:02.600 --> 33:05.880
And by the way, he has remained silent.

33:05.880 --> 33:12.600
Only one individual picked that up repeatedly and that's Bill Maher of HBO.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.280
He hit it right on the head.

33:15.000 --> 33:21.320
Why is Trump silent when in his history he has never been silent?

33:21.320 --> 33:23.640
Don't you fucking tell me that Bill Maher is insightful.

33:26.520 --> 33:27.800
Alex's big enemy.

33:27.800 --> 33:34.840
It's just, you know who they watch all the time by how much they reference how much they

33:34.840 --> 33:35.640
hate them.

33:35.640 --> 33:40.040
And then every time, because you watch Bill Maher all the time so you can hate him.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.880
Eventually he says something where you're like, you know what?

33:41.880 --> 33:43.480
This Bill Maher guy might be right.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.400
Cause you guys are fucking children.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.240
You're toddlers.

33:47.240 --> 33:50.440
You can't, it's just two seconds of like, Oh, I hate him.

33:50.440 --> 33:51.400
I love him.

33:51.400 --> 33:55.160
I'm not going to say that this person doesn't exist, but I don't know anyone I like who

33:55.160 --> 33:55.960
likes Bill Maher.

33:57.640 --> 34:01.000
Ooh, I don't know anyone I like who likes Bill Maher either.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.720
That person may exist and I just don't know it and I wouldn't judge them for it.

34:05.720 --> 34:11.400
But the only people I have any evidence watch Bill Maher are people tweeting stuff.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.040
Yeah.

34:12.040 --> 34:13.640
And Alex and his guests.

34:13.640 --> 34:14.200
Yeah, that does sound right.

34:14.200 --> 34:16.520
All of them watch Bill Maher.

34:16.520 --> 34:21.240
Is Bill Maher just, maybe that's why he's going so far with the racist right nonsense

34:21.240 --> 34:24.760
is just, he's like, Oh, I guess the only people who watch my show are right-wing Nazis.

34:24.760 --> 34:25.720
He's Dennis Millering.

34:25.720 --> 34:28.440
He might be Dennis Millering in front of our eyes.

34:28.440 --> 34:29.160
God damn it.

34:29.160 --> 34:29.880
Oh boy.

34:29.880 --> 34:30.200
Shit.

34:30.200 --> 34:32.360
Uh, equally unfunny.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.240
So, uh, Trump, his whole plan, right?

34:35.240 --> 34:37.880
Is to let Biden show his ass.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.600
He's going to show how incompetent he is.

34:41.320 --> 34:45.880
And this is where Steve begins to drift into possible antisemitism.

34:45.880 --> 34:50.600
Hey, he's showing you how corrupt and stupid Biden is.

34:50.600 --> 34:57.160
I said to you before for years, Biden will pick those people who are incompetent and

34:57.160 --> 35:00.440
corrupt and primarily they were Jewish.

35:00.440 --> 35:05.320
I have a synagogue going on there with blanking with all kinds of people.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.480
I've got 11 Jews in there.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.800
All of whom I've never met before.

35:09.800 --> 35:14.520
Some of whom I have a lot of things in common, but they were all incompetent.

35:14.520 --> 35:15.000
Oh boy.

35:15.560 --> 35:19.880
It seems to really be hammering on the point that people are Jewish.

35:19.880 --> 35:20.280
Wow.

35:20.280 --> 35:25.080
It is you, you, I, I wouldn't have even thought of that as something to bring up unless I

35:25.080 --> 35:26.120
were say a Nazi.

35:26.120 --> 35:26.840
Hmm.

35:26.840 --> 35:33.400
It's so weird the way he speaks to just that, like, I've got, I've got these people in

35:33.400 --> 35:33.880
the government.

35:33.880 --> 35:38.280
Like, dude, I think he just designs trading card decks.

35:38.280 --> 35:43.000
I genuinely think that he just draws like magic, the gathering cards, and they have

35:43.000 --> 35:46.760
like Nancy Pelosi and deep state operative written on them.

35:46.760 --> 35:49.400
And he just tosses them out like a tarot deck.

35:49.400 --> 35:58.200
I begin to wonder if he's not like severely disturbed, like we talk about him.

35:58.200 --> 36:01.880
And I think that one of the reasons that he may not come off as that is because he's in

36:01.880 --> 36:03.160
the Infowars sphere.

36:03.160 --> 36:03.800
Sure, sure.

36:03.800 --> 36:08.360
And Alex portrays him as like this really serious character.

36:08.360 --> 36:13.080
And it's really funny when he snips at Alex, but there is a part of me that, you know,

36:13.080 --> 36:18.760
it has to wrestle with like, does he actually think that he's running like special operations

36:18.760 --> 36:19.400
teams?

36:19.400 --> 36:24.760
Does he think that, like, he has sway within the government and he's got these, these 11

36:24.760 --> 36:29.720
Jewish people who he's never met working in various offices and that's a problem for

36:29.720 --> 36:30.760
him personally?

36:30.760 --> 36:31.240
I don't know.

36:32.280 --> 36:36.760
His wife laughing in the background of that clip makes me really think that he's aware.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.240
She laughs about some other stuff too.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.080
She's, yeah.

36:41.080 --> 36:44.120
Maybe she's on this, on the same boat.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.280
She's in the front seat of whatever boats.

36:46.280 --> 36:49.000
If so, she's not so thrilled with the Jewish people either.

36:49.000 --> 36:49.880
Yeah, that sounds right.

36:49.880 --> 36:56.200
And we have one moron from the National Security Council and the State Department, which is

36:56.200 --> 36:59.160
run by Blanken and Wendy Sherman.

36:59.160 --> 37:02.040
I got a Jew on top there who's never been in the military.

37:02.040 --> 37:02.520
What?

37:02.520 --> 37:04.120
And I have a soda-

37:04.120 --> 37:05.000
Hey, Doc, we've got about an hour here.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.720
We've got about 45 minutes left, but I've got to unpack all this.

37:07.720 --> 37:11.480
I think Alex cut him off there because he realized like, this is going too much.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.080
No, no, no, no, no.

37:13.080 --> 37:14.120
You can't keep doing this.

37:14.120 --> 37:19.080
Uh-uh, we don't, don't say I got a Jew on top ever, ever.

37:19.720 --> 37:20.280
Outrageous.

37:20.280 --> 37:20.840
What?

37:20.840 --> 37:21.400
Outrageous.

37:21.400 --> 37:21.900
Yeah.

37:22.920 --> 37:28.120
So in this next clip, they get to the heart of the matter, which I think that you're actually

37:28.120 --> 37:32.680
more correct, that the heart of the matter is that Steve revealed that he's been manipulating

37:32.680 --> 37:33.180
Alex.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.120
Failing getting into that because they don't.

37:36.120 --> 37:42.280
The issue is that he said that Trump, still going to be president after January 20th,

37:42.280 --> 37:44.280
sure, they get a little bit snippy.

37:44.280 --> 37:46.840
Alex gets snippy with Steve about this.

37:46.840 --> 37:47.640
Let's just go back.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.320
Let's just go with your scenario.

37:49.320 --> 37:51.800
They are doing this anti-racism stand down.

37:52.920 --> 37:53.560
Let's talk about it.

37:53.560 --> 37:56.680
Let's talk about it because they are trying to purge the military right now.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.920
They're saying they think there's a military coup.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.280
You're saying there's a military coup.

38:00.280 --> 38:01.000
What's going on there?

38:02.840 --> 38:03.800
I just said it to you.

38:03.800 --> 38:06.840
Listen, Alex, listen, I'm telling you.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.920
Listen, Trump's going to get inaugurated on the 20th.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.440
I'm saying let's unpack that first.

38:10.440 --> 38:15.480
I didn't say he was going to get inaugurated on the 20th.

38:15.480 --> 38:16.360
I never said that.

38:17.400 --> 38:20.920
I said that he would still be president of the United States.

38:20.920 --> 38:22.600
What's going on in Mar-a-Lago?

38:22.600 --> 38:23.480
You tell me.

38:23.480 --> 38:23.980
Oh, boy.

38:25.320 --> 38:27.000
Fucking psycho.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.760
That is you.

38:28.760 --> 38:29.720
You're not going to win.

38:29.720 --> 38:30.520
Hang up.

38:30.520 --> 38:31.800
Hang up right there.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.960
Steve thinks Trump is still president.

38:33.960 --> 38:34.760
Of course he does.

38:34.760 --> 38:36.600
What's going on in Mar-a-Lago, Dan?

38:36.600 --> 38:38.120
The office of the former president, man.

38:38.120 --> 38:38.680
Exactly.

38:38.680 --> 38:39.160
Yeah.

38:39.160 --> 38:40.840
That's what's going on in Mar-a-Lago.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.120
Former's in the name.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.280
You gotta just get out of here.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.880
Just hang up right then and there and be like, this guy is out.

38:47.880 --> 38:48.280
Yeah.

38:48.280 --> 38:50.360
If I were Alex, I'd be like, no.

38:50.360 --> 38:51.480
Nah, we're not doing that.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.520
Can't let you have that.

38:52.520 --> 38:55.080
You don't get to be angry at me right now, sir.

38:55.080 --> 38:56.200
You don't get to do that.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.880
You don't understand what's happening here.

38:58.520 --> 39:03.320
Yeah, so Alex, I guess he just has to put up with Steve saying like, I didn't say he was

39:03.320 --> 39:04.120
going to get inaugurated.

39:04.120 --> 39:07.400
I say he's still be president and I believe that he still is.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.760
God damn.

39:08.760 --> 39:14.680
So Alex tries to be a dick and tries to reclaim some sort of like, I don't know, authority

39:14.680 --> 39:15.880
in the conversation.

39:15.880 --> 39:16.760
It doesn't really work.

39:16.760 --> 39:20.680
And then we find out that Steve also hates Mormons, which we already knew that.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.640
Well then talk to us because you're so smart.

39:23.640 --> 39:26.600
Like you said, we haven't been in the military like you, like it's a magical level when you

39:26.600 --> 39:27.320
get there.

39:27.320 --> 39:29.160
Tell us then what's going on in your view.

39:30.040 --> 39:33.400
I'm just telling you right now, I said it's part of Sun Tzu.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.480
You understand, Alex, what Sun Tzu is.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.200
You allow the enemy to expose.

39:38.200 --> 39:42.680
Who said all of the faults that they have without intervening.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.040
And he's showing it to you.

39:44.040 --> 39:52.040
The Republican party dead McConnell, a total wastrel, a corrupt individual, Mitt Romney,

39:52.040 --> 39:53.480
corrupt Mormon.

39:53.480 --> 39:58.840
He reminds me of the days of the massacre of Meadows that the Mormons did when they slaughtered

39:58.840 --> 40:04.760
Christians and the Mormons were warned to take care of him and they didn't do it.

40:04.760 --> 40:08.200
What?

40:08.200 --> 40:09.080
Okay.

40:09.080 --> 40:09.560
All right.

40:10.120 --> 40:11.160
He warned the Mormons.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.120
Who warned the Mormons?

40:12.120 --> 40:13.080
It's gotta be Steve.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.520
You warned the Mormons.

40:14.520 --> 40:17.800
Listen, I warned the Mormons, come get your boy.

40:17.800 --> 40:18.680
Come get your boy.

40:18.680 --> 40:20.840
You don't want any more massacres on your hands.

40:21.400 --> 40:22.280
Holy shit.

40:22.280 --> 40:23.000
Wild.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.880
Also interesting to recall that Steve also said that the Pope got arrested like a year

40:27.880 --> 40:28.280
ago.

40:28.280 --> 40:29.320
Yeah, but that one was true.

40:29.320 --> 40:36.600
So at the beginning of this interview, the first way that Steve claimed authority was

40:36.600 --> 40:40.680
to say like, Hey, your audience has been throwing ad hominems around your disgusting audience.

40:40.680 --> 40:41.080
Yeah.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.520
You're a liar, Steve.

40:42.520 --> 40:45.720
A little bit later, Alex realizes that he'd called the audience discussed.

40:45.720 --> 40:46.520
There you go.

40:46.520 --> 40:47.720
It was out of Freudian slip.

40:47.720 --> 40:51.960
You're disgusting audience, or you mean some people that said disgusting things about you

40:51.960 --> 40:53.400
because most of the audience doesn't hate you.

40:54.520 --> 40:55.320
Unfortunately.

40:55.320 --> 40:58.360
Honestly, I don't even read most of the comments.

40:58.360 --> 40:59.640
Let me be very frank.

40:59.640 --> 41:02.760
I'm not interested in what your audience says or doesn't say.

41:03.560 --> 41:04.760
I don't really listen.

41:04.760 --> 41:05.640
Well, you said it.

41:05.640 --> 41:06.200
You said it.

41:07.080 --> 41:08.200
Listen to me, Alex.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.400
You want me on the show?

41:09.400 --> 41:10.200
Cool it.

41:10.200 --> 41:10.600
Cool it.

41:10.600 --> 41:11.400
It was military.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.240
I have nothing to do with Q.

41:13.240 --> 41:14.840
I don't even know who Q is.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.600
I don't read that nonsense.

41:16.600 --> 41:20.680
I have nothing to do with Q or anybody else other than you.

41:20.680 --> 41:22.440
You're the only show I go on.

41:22.440 --> 41:24.440
This is outrageous.

41:24.440 --> 41:25.480
Oh man.

41:25.480 --> 41:26.680
Don't do this interview.

41:26.680 --> 41:27.240
This is so dumb.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.440
Oh God.

41:28.440 --> 41:32.600
There's no point to this, except for Steve to just be me and then see what he can get

41:32.600 --> 41:33.000
away with.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.480
No, the only reason you would do this interview if you're Alex is so you can throw away your

41:37.480 --> 41:38.760
baggage on Steve.

41:38.760 --> 41:43.960
Well, you do that or you'd recognize that, like, he does bring up repeatedly that their

41:43.960 --> 41:46.280
last interview got a lot of traffic.

41:46.280 --> 41:52.840
And the one where Steve was on with Owen saying that the election was a sting operation that

41:52.840 --> 41:53.800
got a lot of traffic.

41:53.800 --> 42:00.440
And so I think that Alex has that motivation, like an attention economy type of motivation.

42:00.440 --> 42:01.400
Because of course he does.

42:01.400 --> 42:01.960
Yeah.

42:01.960 --> 42:07.240
And so Alex will take a little bit of this if it means a couple hundred thousand views

42:07.240 --> 42:07.640
more.

42:07.640 --> 42:08.520
That's true.

42:08.520 --> 42:09.240
In theory.

42:09.240 --> 42:15.080
Yeah, but I would imagine you would get a lot of views if you forced Steve to hang up

42:15.080 --> 42:15.800
on you.

42:15.800 --> 42:16.200
True.

42:16.200 --> 42:16.700
Ooh.

42:17.640 --> 42:20.840
Or if you just were like, Steve, you're making everything up.

42:20.840 --> 42:21.880
Steve, you're a fucking liar.

42:21.880 --> 42:22.680
Tell me more about that.

42:22.680 --> 42:23.160
Yeah.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.440
Steve, have you always been a psychopath?

42:24.440 --> 42:25.240
Oh, no, no, no, no.

42:25.240 --> 42:25.880
Back to the center.

42:25.880 --> 42:26.440
You're a liar.

42:26.440 --> 42:27.080
Yeah, Steve.

42:27.080 --> 42:27.400
Hold on.

42:27.400 --> 42:27.880
No, no, no.

42:27.880 --> 42:28.520
I understand.

42:28.520 --> 42:31.000
I will listen to you, but only on the answer to the question.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.680
Why are you such a fucking liar, Steve?

42:32.680 --> 42:34.920
Oh, Steve, you don't give a shit about what my audience thinks.

42:34.920 --> 42:35.480
Great.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.360
Why are you such a liar?

42:36.360 --> 42:37.880
Why are you such a fucking liar?

42:37.880 --> 42:38.920
Stay on point.

42:38.920 --> 42:39.960
Yeah, get in there.

42:39.960 --> 42:43.080
And because Alex can't do that, Steve's just running circles around him.

42:43.720 --> 42:46.600
You specifically, let's just get this straight.

42:46.600 --> 42:50.440
Because people understand if you were wrong about timing or whatever, you legitimately

42:50.440 --> 42:53.240
thought Trump would end up being sworn in on the 20th.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.360
You said he's going to be the president.

42:55.400 --> 42:57.080
I didn't say he would be on the 20th.

42:57.080 --> 43:02.440
He is still the president of the United States and he will continue to be the president.

43:02.440 --> 43:02.760
Okay.

43:02.760 --> 43:06.360
Well, I know he won the election and it's important not to recognize Biden.

43:06.360 --> 43:09.640
So tell me this, what is your view on what's going to unfold?

43:09.640 --> 43:10.840
How long will it take?

43:10.840 --> 43:13.720
See, Alex is just, he's supplicating.

43:13.720 --> 43:14.840
What are we doing?

43:14.840 --> 43:19.560
He's trying to find ways in which you can accept the things that Steve is saying.

43:19.560 --> 43:21.480
Steve's saying that Trump is still the president.

43:21.480 --> 43:23.720
He's like, well, yeah, the election was stolen.

43:23.720 --> 43:25.640
He's trying to make excuses for Steve.

43:25.640 --> 43:26.120
Totally.

43:26.120 --> 43:31.000
Which is wild because this is supposed to be like Alex's you were wrong dance.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.520
How does he do this?

43:33.080 --> 43:34.360
How is this possible?

43:35.000 --> 43:37.800
It's just, I've seen it too many times.

43:37.800 --> 43:39.560
How can one man never learn?

43:40.200 --> 43:44.520
Like, is he physically incapable of the act of learning?

43:44.520 --> 43:49.160
It makes you wonder if Steve's not like independently wealthy and like paying Alex

43:49.160 --> 43:50.040
or something.

43:50.040 --> 43:50.360
Yeah.

43:50.360 --> 43:50.840
I don't know.

43:50.840 --> 43:54.120
But like, there's some dynamic here that just doesn't make sense.

43:54.120 --> 43:54.600
No.

43:54.600 --> 43:59.000
And like, it's really easy if you just see a couple examples of it to be like, Alex is

43:59.000 --> 43:59.960
dumb and gullible.

43:59.960 --> 44:00.440
Yeah.

44:00.440 --> 44:05.080
And maybe that is what it is, but it's such an extreme level of like, you could just get

44:05.080 --> 44:06.920
burned by this dude over and over again.

44:06.920 --> 44:07.240
Yeah.

44:07.240 --> 44:12.280
No, this is fealty on, on like Sith Lord levels of like, you know, he's trying to kill you

44:12.280 --> 44:13.240
all the time, right?

44:13.240 --> 44:14.920
What are we doing here, man?

44:14.920 --> 44:21.960
So you're seeing right now the exposure of the Biden corrupt incompetent government.

44:22.920 --> 44:30.520
What you're seeing now is the exposure of a corrupt incompetent regime of Biden and

44:30.520 --> 44:31.640
all his people.

44:31.640 --> 44:36.920
And what it really is, it's not only an indictment of Biden, forget that.

44:36.920 --> 44:40.600
It's an indictment of Obama and Brennan.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.920
This goes to the heart of the matter.

44:42.920 --> 44:48.040
Obama, as I told you, was a gay, flaming homosexual.

44:48.680 --> 44:54.200
Nobody who came was the CIA operative and Brennan was his control officer.

44:54.200 --> 44:54.760
All right.

44:54.760 --> 44:55.400
All right.

44:55.400 --> 44:56.200
Okay.

44:56.200 --> 45:04.680
So instead of exoriating Steve for being a psychopathic liar, he is instead allowing

45:04.680 --> 45:06.680
Steve to be a raging bigot.

45:06.680 --> 45:07.320
Yeah.

45:07.320 --> 45:08.760
With no pushback whatsoever.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.520
Well, I don't think Alex sees a problem with any of that.

45:10.520 --> 45:13.160
Well, that I do understand that.

45:13.160 --> 45:14.120
Yes, I agree.

45:14.760 --> 45:18.120
Although this next clip does get into territory where Alex has a problem.

45:18.120 --> 45:21.560
And that is Steve is like, I love Brian Stelter.

45:21.560 --> 45:22.600
No, no.

45:22.600 --> 45:24.360
And just your narratives aren't real.

45:24.920 --> 45:28.680
Like, Alex, the two of them are arguing about whether or not the election was stolen.

45:28.680 --> 45:29.320
Great.

45:29.320 --> 45:34.520
Am I getting through to you how incompetent and what we have to show?

45:34.520 --> 45:37.080
Yeah, they stole the election and took over.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.040
They stole what election?

45:40.040 --> 45:41.640
They stole the election and take over.

45:41.640 --> 45:42.600
They're so incompetent.

45:42.600 --> 45:43.560
Checkmate.

45:43.560 --> 45:46.760
Let me ask you, how do you know they stole the election?

45:46.760 --> 45:48.360
We are the numbers coming in.

45:49.560 --> 45:54.200
Trump had double, triple, quadruple in battleground states before they shut down the election

45:54.200 --> 45:55.000
that night and stole it.

45:56.600 --> 45:59.160
And you said it's a theta complete, right?

45:59.160 --> 46:00.680
You think that's over?

46:00.680 --> 46:01.960
And I'm saying here's the deal.

46:01.960 --> 46:04.440
I never give up, but I'm also realistic about what I face.

46:05.240 --> 46:07.880
And you think I am a wishful thinker.

46:07.880 --> 46:10.360
That's why I come on your show.

46:10.360 --> 46:13.960
I just know that I talk to a lot of people in the government.

46:13.960 --> 46:14.760
Hold on, Steve.

46:14.760 --> 46:16.760
Seriously, listen, hold on a minute.

46:16.760 --> 46:18.440
I mean, I talk to a lot of really smart people.

46:18.440 --> 46:22.120
They tell me the country's in deep, deep trouble and we're in a globalist takeover right now.

46:22.120 --> 46:25.880
They're planning to set bombs off all over the country and start trying a civil war.

46:25.880 --> 46:28.280
So I'm really concerned for my family, everybody else right now.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.920
Oh, who's going to set bombs?

46:32.200 --> 46:33.400
The Southern Poverty Law Center.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.440
Southern Poverty Law Center?

46:36.440 --> 46:39.320
Yeah, they're in Elohim City. They ran the attack on Oklahoma City out.

46:40.520 --> 46:41.400
Come on, come on, come on.

46:41.400 --> 46:42.680
I know them very well.

46:42.680 --> 46:44.200
They haven't said anything.

46:47.000 --> 46:47.720
I know that.

46:48.760 --> 46:49.720
Come on.

46:49.720 --> 46:52.760
The SPLC and I play golf on the weekends.

46:52.760 --> 46:53.960
What are you talking about?

46:53.960 --> 46:58.360
Alex, you're saying that the SPLC did Oklahoma City and they're planning bombings.

46:58.360 --> 47:00.280
What are you talking about?

47:00.280 --> 47:05.400
Also, Alex, the only people threatening to do bombs and all that stuff.

47:05.400 --> 47:06.760
We're on your show.

47:07.560 --> 47:09.960
Yeah, or associates thereof.

47:09.960 --> 47:14.600
So I think that's really funny because this is not threatening to Alex,

47:14.600 --> 47:19.960
except because Steve is seen as a credible voice because of Alex's actions.

47:19.960 --> 47:20.840
Yes, indeed.

47:20.840 --> 47:25.480
None of this would be a problem except for that Alex can't discount him as a crazy person.

47:26.680 --> 47:31.720
No, unfortunately this petard is too high, so I will have to jump on top of it.

47:31.720 --> 47:35.960
I know the SPLC. Alex, what election? The election's not done.

47:36.600 --> 47:40.280
That's a solid swing. I like that response. I like that response.

47:40.280 --> 47:42.840
So the election was stolen. What election?

47:42.840 --> 47:47.480
Ooh, now we've got a whole new wrinkle into our little lunacy.

47:48.360 --> 47:55.880
So one of the main devices by which Steve exerts his control over Alex is flattery, of course,

47:55.880 --> 47:57.720
and also patronizing him.

47:57.720 --> 47:58.200
Yes.

47:58.200 --> 48:00.280
He treats him like a little baby.

48:00.280 --> 48:00.840
Right.

48:00.840 --> 48:03.960
But a lot of the flattery is in service of that patronizing.

48:03.960 --> 48:06.040
Indeed. It infantilizes him in such a way.

48:06.040 --> 48:08.440
Oh, you're such an insightful mind.

48:08.440 --> 48:14.200
Yeah. No, no. It's interesting that we start with Alex being like,

48:14.200 --> 48:17.720
my dad told me this when I was younger, so I'm going to believe it until I die.

48:17.720 --> 48:21.720
And then we get CVPs coming in here doing it like, oh, you're a good boy.

48:21.720 --> 48:26.280
Now stop it. Don't you do that. But you're a good boy. You're a good boy.

48:26.280 --> 48:26.780
Yeah.

48:26.780 --> 48:32.220
Hmm. Alex knows that because he now in the middle of this interview,

48:32.220 --> 48:37.100
they start arguing about whether or not Steve is patronizing him, which is really sad.

48:37.100 --> 48:37.900
This is just sad.

48:38.460 --> 48:44.140
And now here in Florida, we're not listening to either Fauci, who, by the way, was exposed.

48:44.140 --> 48:49.980
Isn't that interesting? Trump didn't have to say he was a total fraud because the New York Times

48:49.980 --> 48:54.860
and the Atlantic Monthly exposed nonsense about wearing a mask.

48:54.860 --> 48:58.780
Now you don't wear one mask. You wear two masks. So take it easy, Alex.

48:59.340 --> 49:02.700
Listen to what's going on. Do not get upset.

49:03.420 --> 49:07.980
And what I'm nice to you. And I think you actually believe the stuff you're saying.

49:07.980 --> 49:10.780
And you're an interesting talk show host and people like you on the show.

49:10.780 --> 49:14.700
So I like you as a person. But the patronizing dude, I'm 47 years old.

49:14.700 --> 49:18.700
I've been around the block 100 times. I don't patronize you. I'm being serious about this.

49:21.500 --> 49:22.380
What do you want me to say?

49:22.380 --> 49:27.340
I've said to you, Alex, I've said to you exactly what's happening.

49:27.340 --> 49:29.180
Am I patronizing you?

49:29.180 --> 49:29.680
Yes.

49:30.220 --> 49:32.060
Am I saying you're wrong?

49:32.060 --> 49:32.560
Yes.

49:35.020 --> 49:38.700
I just this show is fucked up.

49:38.700 --> 49:44.780
Like this is supposed to be a show where you talk about the the politics and the deep workings

49:44.780 --> 49:46.140
of the New World Order.

49:46.140 --> 49:52.780
Deep workings of the New World Order. The first hour is grotesque discussions of imaginary

49:53.660 --> 49:56.380
child abuse fantasies that he has.

49:56.380 --> 50:01.340
Second hour is a psycho drama with an old man who's been manipulating him for years.

50:01.340 --> 50:03.500
Yeah, we're watching a weird soap opera right now.

50:03.500 --> 50:07.180
And it's it's a little bit. I'm not sure what's going on here.

50:07.180 --> 50:10.700
I think this second hour, Alex thought he was going to come in and be like,

50:10.700 --> 50:12.060
hey, Steve, you fucked up.

50:12.060 --> 50:15.340
Yeah, Steve was like, you know what? You get some right. You get some wrong.

50:15.340 --> 50:17.420
And they could build the next thing.

50:17.420 --> 50:20.300
And instead, Steve's like, Trump is still president.

50:20.300 --> 50:23.260
How do you not see this coming?

50:23.260 --> 50:25.100
How do you not see this coming?

50:25.100 --> 50:29.900
And because Steve is a wall, he's not somebody that's going to move and he doesn't give a fuck.

50:29.900 --> 50:30.700
Why would he?

50:30.700 --> 50:31.200
Yeah.

50:31.820 --> 50:35.420
What exertion can you put upon Steve to make him move?

50:35.420 --> 50:37.260
Oh, you can't come on my show anymore?

50:37.260 --> 50:38.860
Clearly I can.

50:38.860 --> 50:46.140
Yeah. And Alex seems to have gotten to that realization and he starts kind of trying to

50:46.140 --> 50:47.820
help Steve make his arguments more.

50:47.820 --> 50:48.780
God, I hate him so much.

50:48.780 --> 50:53.420
Steve is saying that Trump is still president at the Mar-a-Lago and what have you.

50:53.420 --> 50:53.900
Sure.

50:53.900 --> 50:58.140
And he's going to come back, which coincidentally is another Q narrative.

50:58.140 --> 50:58.780
Yeah. Okay.

50:58.780 --> 51:00.220
But yeah, he's like.

51:00.220 --> 51:04.620
I don't know anything about Q. I don't read that stuff from this website, this website,

51:04.620 --> 51:08.140
this website, this website, this website, and this website that I don't read.

51:08.140 --> 51:13.580
Suspiciously, most of the stuff I say has to do with things that are popular in Q communities,

51:13.580 --> 51:15.100
but it's a coincidence.

51:15.100 --> 51:15.600
Yeah.

51:16.300 --> 51:20.380
So yeah, I mean, for someone who is pretending to disagree with Steve,

51:21.260 --> 51:24.700
Alex is trying to help make that point that Trump's going to return.

51:25.420 --> 51:28.860
Now they're obsessed with Trump. They're saying he's getting more popular, not less.

51:28.860 --> 51:33.580
That, that actually has credibility with Pechenich saying, Pechenich, in my opinion,

51:33.580 --> 51:36.620
is walking back a little bit that had this big events could happen on the 20th.

51:36.620 --> 51:42.540
Uh, but, but I do agree. They stole the election. Trump is the president, but here he is last year,

51:42.540 --> 51:45.820
seven, eight months ago, I'm going from memory. Maybe you guys can find the day.

51:45.820 --> 51:51.900
Here he is at a appliance factory in the Midwest saying, Hey, I've, I've stood up to big pharma.

51:51.900 --> 51:54.860
We're paying the highest prices. I've cut the prices, which he did by half.

51:54.860 --> 51:59.260
They're going to come after me. I'm going to be gone for a while. Here it is.

51:59.260 --> 52:03.980
He's have to produce a product and it has to be a good product, but the middlemen,

52:03.980 --> 52:09.340
well, the rebate that I'm doing cuts out the middle men and it reduces costs. And the

52:09.340 --> 52:14.220
money goes back to the people purchasing the drugs. So I have a lot of enemies out there.

52:14.220 --> 52:18.940
This may be the last time you'll see me for a while. A lot of very, very rich enemies,

52:18.940 --> 52:23.740
but they are not happy with what I'm doing, but I figured we have one chance to do it.

52:23.740 --> 52:29.660
And no other president's going to do what I do. No other president would do a favored nations,

52:29.660 --> 52:36.540
a rebate, a buy from other nations at much less cost. Nobody. And there are a lot of unhappy

52:36.540 --> 52:40.540
people. And then he said at the military base, before he got on the planet, Florida,

52:40.540 --> 52:45.340
Malago, he said, I will, I will be back. So, so that adds something there to what you're

52:45.340 --> 52:49.660
saying, but you know, I just want to put all our marbles on Trump. Why are you doing this?

52:50.300 --> 52:56.540
Why are you doing this? This is outrageous. There's no reason to do this. You're supposed

52:56.540 --> 53:01.260
to disagree with Steve, not go out of your way to find clips of Trump that

53:01.260 --> 53:09.180
seem to back up what Steve's saying. I, I, I just, I'm just, just jangle keys.

53:09.180 --> 53:13.660
Is that what we need to do? Do we, have we just been jangling keys wrong? Has that been our

53:13.660 --> 53:17.900
problem? Is that why the right has been allowed to flourish is we haven't found the right color

53:17.900 --> 53:22.700
of keys to dangle outside of their vision so they can get distracted instantaneously.

53:22.700 --> 53:28.700
It's pretty, I don't know, man. This is why this is fucking out of, I, I, no,

53:28.700 --> 53:32.220
you don't let it get people get it. They don't get away with it.

53:33.420 --> 53:38.860
So I have two clips here from Steve's interview. There's more, but these next two are just sort of

53:38.860 --> 53:44.780
like, I got lost in the incoherence and pointlessness of this interview, but I still

53:44.780 --> 53:49.820
think that these two clips are interesting to listen to for the social dynamics between these

53:49.820 --> 53:56.300
two dudes. But that my point is this, what he's letting you do is the biggest apprentice show he's

53:56.300 --> 54:03.900
ever done. He's putting America into project. He's literally showing you the American show,

54:03.900 --> 54:09.580
which is massive corruption. And the first president, we didn't have it with Bush senior.

54:09.580 --> 54:15.020
He was corrupt. I worked with him. We didn't have it with Nixon. He was corrupt. Jimmy Carter. He

54:15.020 --> 54:22.460
was corrupt. Clinton's they were corrupt. Okay. Let me just tell you what I witnessed. Trump means

54:22.460 --> 54:26.540
well, he cares about the country. He's not out to get us. He was the president that pissed him off.

54:26.540 --> 54:32.460
I was there when almost the whole white house was gone and he had like 10 staffers that were loyal.

54:32.460 --> 54:36.540
And then, and then, and then the secret service stood down at the Capitol and he literally pointed

54:36.540 --> 54:39.980
at me and I led the people out. And I was like, my God, this is really happening. And then we

54:39.980 --> 54:45.420
got set up. So just the idea that Trump's got all this masterful stuff going on. This sounds

54:45.420 --> 54:50.220
like a reboot. I mean, I agree politically, what you're saying is happening. This is destroying by

54:50.220 --> 54:53.820
the Democrats worse than ever. As they turn the economy off, as they launch all these wars,

54:53.820 --> 54:58.540
people are like, whoa, this is horrible. I get it at a Machiavelli level or a Sun Tzu level or

54:58.540 --> 55:02.140
a Napoleon level. They'll interrupt your enemy while they're destroying themselves. But I mean,

55:02.140 --> 55:05.820
they're destroying us. They're, they're, they're coming after our guns. They are,

55:05.820 --> 55:09.980
I think they'll lose in the end, but they're just crazy. So I just don't,

55:09.980 --> 55:13.420
I mean, I know people that know Trump well, he's isolated at Mar-a-Lago right now.

55:15.820 --> 55:19.580
And what, what, the point is what? That is my question too.

55:23.580 --> 55:28.700
That's a good response because that was incoherent. It was a whole bunch of different

55:28.700 --> 55:32.940
spaghetti strands being thrown up against the wall. Yeah. I think he might as well have just

55:32.940 --> 55:38.220
said, I'm not going to bail you out on that one. Nope. Nope. You're going to stare. Yeah.

55:40.780 --> 55:46.860
You are saying what now? So they're talking about Trump being isolated there at the end. And this,

55:46.860 --> 55:52.540
this goes on to just bickering. The point is you're saying Trump is like, you know,

55:52.540 --> 55:56.940
Mr. Spacely and the Jetsons with all his hands on the levers for my information,

55:57.900 --> 56:01.900
he needs to be out in the public fighting. He needs to be exposing. He needs to go into that

56:01.900 --> 56:06.780
trial to annihilate them in the Senate and be thrown in that briar patch. Instead,

56:06.780 --> 56:10.140
he's totally cut off with a bunch of cowardly lawyers telling him to be afraid of a shadow.

56:11.900 --> 56:17.980
How do you know he's totally cut off? I mean, I mean, I've talked to the president,

56:17.980 --> 56:20.780
some people that talk to him. I know, I know the lawyers that are involved. I mean,

56:20.780 --> 56:29.180
I know that he's cut off. And what is this next trial about the second impeachment? What does

56:29.180 --> 56:33.980
that mean? No, it's totally fake. John Roberts isn't involved. It's a sham. Now they're trying

56:33.980 --> 56:37.900
to back off of it. I think he should go into that briar patch and use that to expose them.

56:39.340 --> 56:45.580
But he's already, when did you ever hear besides what I have said that John Roberts is one of the

56:45.580 --> 56:51.820
most corrupt Supreme Court justices we've ever had. He's been involved with Malta. He's been

56:51.820 --> 56:57.340
involved with all kinds of problems and his adoption of kids. When did you ever hear that

56:57.340 --> 57:03.020
other than from me? And now you're beginning to see how the chief justice of the Supreme Court

57:03.020 --> 57:09.660
is so corrupt and what may have happened to another chief justice. Was somebody killed by

57:09.660 --> 57:14.220
the way? Was there a member of the Supreme Court who might've been killed? I don't know.

57:15.500 --> 57:22.060
What are you doing? Wait, what is happening now? No, Steve, you're a fucking liar. Yeah. I can't

57:22.060 --> 57:27.740
tell if he's going back to Scalia or if he's talking about like a current Supreme Court

57:27.740 --> 57:34.620
justice or Ruth Bader Ginsburg maybe. Did they kill somebody? Just tell me who. It's a sitting

57:34.620 --> 57:38.940
Supreme Court justice dead and we're in a fucking... Stop playing this vague game. It's not fun. Are we

57:38.940 --> 57:46.540
weekend Bernie easing half the Supreme Court right now? So dumb. So that kind of is indicative of how

57:46.540 --> 57:53.340
a lot of this interview goes. There's just two delusional weirdos but with slightly different

57:53.340 --> 57:59.100
delusions that neither is really willing to give up. Although Alex's commitment is so much weaker

57:59.100 --> 58:05.420
than Steve's and so you find him coming around. My God's a wolf so he'll kill your God. Nah,

58:05.420 --> 58:10.300
my God's an eagle so he'll kill your God. No, a wolf has jumping powers and this and that. Yeah,

58:10.300 --> 58:15.020
I don't care. I don't care. You're arguing about imaginary nonsense. No, there is one thing you

58:15.020 --> 58:21.020
might care about. What's that? And that is bets. They made a bet. Bets? Yeah. Okay. They made a bet

58:21.020 --> 58:27.260
and that is that if Steve was correct he would get a job at Infowars. Correct. If Steve was not

58:27.260 --> 58:33.260
correct he could never come back on again. So the bet is now meaningless. Well, here's an interesting

58:33.260 --> 58:38.940
question. Are we double or nothinging? There's no arbiter of who is right or who is wrong. I thought

58:38.940 --> 58:45.340
reality was. Well, Steve insists that Trump is still president. That's fair. So what happens then?

58:45.340 --> 58:51.580
That's a good question. Steve thinks he's won this bet. That is, that is a fascinating conundrum we

58:51.580 --> 58:56.780
have found ourselves in. Yes and so Alex suggests a middle ground that I don't think anyone is going

58:56.780 --> 59:01.820
to go for. People like it when you come on the show. So even though you didn't win the bet,

59:01.820 --> 59:06.220
you did come back on the show. So I appreciate that. We're gonna go to break.

59:06.220 --> 59:10.380
Can you hear me? And what if I'm right? Will you eventually hire me then?

59:11.900 --> 59:13.660
Only if you come host a show with David Knight.

59:16.700 --> 59:20.060
All right, we're gonna go to break. We're gonna come right back on the other side.

59:21.420 --> 59:25.020
Wow, ladies and gentlemen. That would be a hot show actually. Those two together.

59:25.580 --> 59:29.660
They have little canes and beat each other in the heads with them. Okay, folks, we're gonna go to

59:29.660 --> 59:34.140
break. Little people hitting each other. I'm not saying they're little people. That's a quote from

59:34.140 --> 59:38.860
Time Band. It's a pretty funny movie. Whoa. Wow. Listen, I gotta pay some bills or I won't be here.

59:42.540 --> 59:47.180
Yes, I will. I don't know. I don't know if I could stop myself from at least tuning in to see what

59:47.180 --> 59:54.220
David Knight and Stevie P's show would be like. I don't know these people personally, but I find it

59:54.220 --> 59:58.540
very difficult to imagine that David would ever agree to that. Oh, I would love it though.

59:58.540 --> 01:00:07.020
The dynamic between them. Steve is a loud, boorish, nonsense peddler and David Knight is a quiet,

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:11.180
stated moron. But that's why I think David wouldn't do it. Well, yeah, obviously.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:16.300
I don't know. He's been out of work for a while. When you've been out of work for a while,

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:20.540
sometimes you're like, I'll take one. He's boring as hell and we're not into him,

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:25.500
but that doesn't mean that there isn't an audience that came along with him. He's doing his own show

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:31.420
on something. Maybe a bit shoot. I don't fucking know. But I bet he's making something off that.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:37.420
Who knows? I don't know. And I bet that Alex gave him some money. Yeah, I would believe that. I

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:41.260
would absolutely believe that. There is almost certainly some shut up money. Oh, yeah. Oh,

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:47.660
yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I do like the idea of Alex suggesting that he can have a show if he co-hosts

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:53.420
David Knight because that is a fuck you to David Knight. A huge fuck you to David Knight. And

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:58.700
that's the only thing it is. It's not a serious suggestion. It doesn't bother Steve. No. It is

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.460
a way of him saying, I'm not going to hire you. Yeah, absolutely. That's true. That's true. But

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:06.060
everybody knew that he wasn't going to get hired anyways and Stevie Peace wouldn't want a job

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:10.300
even if it was offered. I think Steve would. I think it's actually, I mean, Steve saying,

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:14.780
are you still going to hire me? I think that that's one of the few moments of weakness that

01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:20.060
you kind of see from Steve that he's actually, he seems interested in that, which is weird.

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:24.540
Wow. So he really does think he's right. Well, yeah. Or at least he thinks he can gaslight

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:32.460
Alex into a job. Imagine how gullible the employees at InfoWars are if you can trick

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:41.260
Alex this easily. Wild. Yeah. I would say, you know, Steve needs someone to help him turn on

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:46.620
the Skype and stuff. So if I were him, yeah, maybe you would want to get a job at InfoWars.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:52.460
They're producers there. That's true. I don't know. That's true. Anyway, Steve is a man of many

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:58.220
talents. Getting Aldo Morrow killed is one of them. Yeah. Lying to Alex. That wasn't really

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:03.260
a talent. He was really good at it. Well, that's more of a proficiency, I suppose.

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:09.980
But turns out he has another skill that Alex brings up and that is poetry reading.

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:17.340
Okay. Look, he actually goes to coffee shops and reads poetry in his off time. So this guy

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:22.140
doesn't just go out there. A bunch of Tom Clancy or help found Delta Force. He's reading poetry

01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:26.780
and, and, and everybody gets really excited when he talks about who it's dedicated to.

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:42.780
This is called Impending Chaos by Steve Pichanik. Here's the end of it.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:08.460
Penetrating the invisible and the dead. Silence the common one. For those who go, not die or

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:20.540
disappear. Glorious in excelsis. Theopolis. Lucifer will bear the morning star for heaven and

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:30.940
earth. Lucifer, amen. What is this? So it's like, Oh, false narratives, but someday they'll come

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:37.340
true. Like HP Lovecraft, like someday even death may die. So is this a love letter to Lucifer,

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:40.620
Steve Pichanik? Are you secretly got a little heart for the devil?

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:49.180
No, I have the heart for no, neither the devil nor the angels. What I have a heart for

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:54.380
is simply, and why I go on your show, you're the only show I ever go on is number one,

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:58.860
your incredible intelligence. Number two, your incredible sense of humor.

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:03.820
Let me, let me, let me, let me translate that for you. My religion is fucking with you.

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:09.100
That's the only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning. I don't care about the devil.

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:13.020
I don't care about the angels. I am going to manipulate the shit out of you.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:20.780
It's just what I got to do. Ah, this, this is a new poem. Uh, a rat done bit my sister Nell.

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:26.620
Um, I think it's Steve's a weird dude. The idea that he's doing poetry readings is

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:30.860
interesting. Makes perfect sense to me. I mean, on some level, yeah.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:37.980
It's nice that he has hobbies that are harmless. I don't understand why Alex would

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:44.300
respond to a poem that ends with a amen to Lucifer, as if it's just a joke when he takes

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:49.500
this very, very seriously than anybody else brings up the devil or doesn't bring up the devil.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.060
Yeah, especially when they don't bring up the devil, I would argue.

01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.820
Now here's what's interesting. What's that?

01:04:54.460 --> 01:05:02.460
After this, I can't tell if this is a joke or not, but Steve literally refers to himself as a son of

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:09.980
Lucifer. Okay. Now as Lucifer and the son of Lucifer, I basically looked at cold fact. When

01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:18.780
nine 11 occurred, I was ostracized within minutes. I was deprecated ostracized and Bob Gates of the

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:25.500
secretary of defense and the former DCI, whom I couldn't admire at all. I thought he was disgusting

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:31.100
and stupid because he couldn't get in the rank corporation. Basically warned me not to do a coup.

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:36.220
I almost guarantee that right after nine 11, Steve was not a high priority.

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:40.540
No, I don't. I don't think people are like, Oh no, Steve's going to run a coup.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:44.860
No, it was, it was between the first and the second. They were like, real quick,

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:49.580
we got to make sure Steve is out of step. Get him in the box.

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:56.300
Steve has been waiting to do a coup for no reason. Now we got something. Get him.

01:05:56.300 --> 01:06:01.340
Yeah. I think he might've been joking, but I was, I was blown away that Alex doesn't like,

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:05.100
why'd you refer to yourself as a son of Lucifer? Should we be talking?

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:09.580
Ah, Dan, we are all technically the sons of Lucifer, Lucifer, of course, the light bringer

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:15.900
and Michael, the demiurge, the two of them together without which none of creation would happen.

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:18.460
I find it weird. Okay. Well, that's also fair.

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:24.380
I also find it weird that this interview kind of ends with Alex and Steve being buddies and

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:27.340
they're just sort of shit ago, David Knight. I hate them both.

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:32.060
Would you host a daily show with David Knight? I'll bring him back. If you host it with him.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:40.300
I have no hard feelings for David Knight. It's not an issue of David Knight or you or me.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:50.220
All I'm saying is I want to come back on your show and say to you, okay, where's my position?

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:53.180
I agree. How about a debate between you and David Knight? That'd be great.

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:57.580
Oh, no, not yet. This is an attack. I hope David does well.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.020
David's got his own show. He's doing right now.

01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:04.300
Wait, I thought you said it was a budget thing.

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:11.820
Huh? That's weird. If I were David Knight, I would take this as an attack too, because it is.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:15.020
David's going to take this as an attack, but it's not because I love him very much

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:18.700
and I definitely haven't been attacking him this entire time. No, that'd be weird.

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.980
He seems to be also sort of thinking of David Knight as a thing.

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:25.900
You know, like I'll bring him back. I don't think he's a human come back.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.660
No, he's a human being, sir. I will make him dance with you.

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:38.300
Wild. I would be so, so furious. That wouldn't even insult me. If I was David Knight,

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:42.700
that would insult me. That Steve is back would insult me more than anything I could imagine.

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:47.660
I think if I were David, I'd probably be considering speaking to a lawyer to break my

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:52.780
NBA. Totally. I would just be like, all right, well, now it's time to talk about everything I

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:58.460
know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, you can't do this. You fired me because this guy lied and then you

01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:04.140
called him on it and then you brought him back and now you're buddies again? No, fuck you. I'm out.

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:06.780
I think the problem is that, you know, Steve's a good guy.

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:11.900
All right. Well, I think you meant what you said, and I don't think you did it out of meanness

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:16.940
or madness. And that's what my gut tells me. So steveachinney.com. Hey, come back on next week.

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:21.500
We're challenging David Knight. He come in studio and we will. Okay. All right. Hey,

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:24.380
steveachinney.com. Thank you so much. We got another guest coming up. I appreciate

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:27.900
spending time with us. All right. We'll be right back. Well, that was a powerful interview,

01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:30.780
ladies and gentlemen, and definitely something is going on. I don't know what it is,

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:35.660
but it's crazy. The office of the former president. Yeah. Something is going on.

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:40.220
I don't know. I don't know what needs to happen other than like a permanent dunk

01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:45.020
tank for these two idiots. There's no place that they can be allowed in polite society

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:49.340
without being a cancer upon the rest of us, other than in a permanent dunk tank,

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:54.460
where I can throw apples at a target. I mean, I understand what you're saying and I hear,

01:08:54.460 --> 01:09:03.740
I hear you. I don't under, I don't get it. Nah. I, I can't imagine, like I've listened to this

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:13.420
show so much for so long and legitimately there's just a reality that is being denied by Steve.

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:17.180
And I would have thought that Alex would stand up for basic tenants of reality.

01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:21.820
Just anything. Anything. I can't, I can't believe this interview went how it did.

01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:26.940
No, I'm, I'm, I'm. It's outrageous. No, I'm furious. I'm furious.

01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:30.460
I didn't know what to expect when I heard like Steve's coming in. He's got to face the music.

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:37.580
I wasn't expecting this. I was not expecting, I am shaking with rage on, I guess, Alex's behalf.

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:44.940
Alex can't decide whether or not he wants to like say Steve is wrong and push back against his shit

01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:50.140
or like play clips of Trump saying I'm going to be gone for a while to try and help Steve make his

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:55.420
arguments. He's trying to play both sides of this fence and you can't. Nope. It makes no sense to.

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:59.980
One of them is, uh, well actually both of them are imagined. Eh, fuck it. Who cares?

01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:02.300
Do whatever you want, but you're a monster and an idiot.

01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:05.020
I thought that there would be a point where Alex would just have to be like,

01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:10.700
Steve, we've gone too far. Yeah. I wish you the best. Have fun in Florida. Uh,

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:13.820
I'm not talking to you anymore. And no, it turns out there's not.

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:16.380
Nope. We're buddies now. Yeah. I, I just.

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:21.500
It really makes me wonder like what happened after the Las Vegas shooting that made Alex

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:24.860
stop talking to him for a good like six, eight months.

01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:28.220
Better legal advice. Maybe. Maybe he had more to protect then,

01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:31.420
or maybe, maybe David Knight was more of an influence then.

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:38.140
Could be. Could be. I just, I'm, I'm. The judgment skills are outrageously bad.

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:40.460
I really am a little bit speechless at this. Yeah.

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:43.740
This is the. Well, get ready to be

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:47.340
speechful, uh, because Alex has another guest. Oh no.

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:48.540
In the third hour. Okay.

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:51.260
And, uh, he's a boog boy. Oh God.

01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:55.580
Alex is in love with the boogaloo boys. I don't, I can't hang.

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:58.620
He has Magnus Panvidio back on. What are we doing?

01:10:58.620 --> 01:10:59.500
Yeah. What are we doing?

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:03.820
Because Magnus offered to get this Antifa person, uh, for Alex to interview.

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:06.940
And so this is the coming to fruition of that. Uh huh.

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:14.380
It's not really that interesting outside of saying that like Alex is clearly down now.

01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.580
Yeah. With the boogaloo boys.

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:19.660
Yeah. Um, and uh, Magnus is still full of shit.

01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:24.620
Yeah. So just having people talking to each other and more and more groups kind of reaching out

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:30.540
and then the establishment has kind of picked up wind of this and a lot of progressive and liberal

01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:34.220
YouTube channels that have been talking about, Hey, maybe unity, Hey, maybe we should work

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:37.740
together with X Trump supporters. They've started to get demonetized or have their

01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:41.900
Facebook pages talked out. We'll take it out. Which is like, Oh, that's really convenient that,

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:45.260
you know, like they're saying the same thing they've been saying all last year,

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:48.220
but the moment they started to be like, Hey, maybe we should work with Trump supporters.

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:51.260
Maybe we should reach out to the right. They get there.

01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:57.420
You know, you guys want revolution and a change. You don't want a civil war, right?

01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.620
Yeah. And that's, that's what they want. And that's what I've been saying from the very beginning.

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:06.140
Wow. Okay. What, what's, uh, what's the, what is the boogaloo mean then?

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:09.980
Yeah. Like just like, Oh yeah, you don't want, you don't want a civil war. Okay.

01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:13.900
Interesting. Yeah. Interesting. Cause why are you wearing a Hawaiian shirt?

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.700
Yeah. It's a big luau, right? No, don't, don't tell me.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.580
Why does your flag have a big igloo on it? Oh, big igloo, boogaloo. Oh,

01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:23.660
it's all electric boogaloo. Part two. Civil war two. Come on, dude.

01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:28.300
These people need to stop fucking around. Stop pretending out unreal.

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:32.620
I just think they need to be honest. And that's one of the reasons why these interviews are

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:40.460
so weird is because there's deceptiveness, but there it's clearly like deceptiveness

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:43.020
for the target audience. Yeah.

01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:46.940
Like this is deceptiveness. That's tailored to Alex's audience.

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:55.980
Yeah. This is more infomercial. This is not an interview. This isn't a fucking news show.

01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:59.420
This is an infomercial for why you should be cool with the boogaloo boys.

01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:03.340
Yeah. Yeah. And one of the things you might be afraid of is that they want a civil war.

01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:07.980
He's just said they don't. Great. Now he doesn't want a civil war,

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:10.780
but what he does want is a war against the government.

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:15.260
The opponent, everyone we've always talked about is the federal government.

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:21.260
There's never a meme made or a post made about going out and fighting Democrats or going out

01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:25.420
and attacking Trump supporters. None of our information, none of our messaging has ever

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:29.260
been about that. Everything we've always talked about is the government and particularly the

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:33.660
federal government. That's always been the opponent. So it's never been a civil war.

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:38.860
And we've already, most of us have stated that if there was some Republican versus Democrat

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:43.420
kind of civil warfare, most of us wouldn't participate. We would go out into our cabins

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:47.020
and into the woods and just try to stay out of it.

01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:52.860
Go fuck yourself. But also, this is so disingenuous because he's pretending that he has this idea of

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:57.980
this war against the federal government as if the majority of the country wouldn't side with

01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:05.580
the government over him. That's the part that is the real imaginary world bullshit that he's trying

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:10.780
to pull off. It's like, no, yeah, we don't want to hurt anybody. What about everybody who thinks

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:16.060
that the government shouldn't be overthrown by force? Oh, well, I mean, I've never seen it.

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:19.820
You end up having to hurt them. No, no, no. I've never met any of those people. I've been

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:24.380
on the internet. Everybody hates the federal government. So what'll happen is all of the

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:29.900
people in the United States. Now, obviously I assume that the people who are paid by the

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:34.620
federal government, you know, there's what, three, four, five million people? There's a lot of people

01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:40.940
that would probably rejoin the boogaloo boy in this fight against the federal government.

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:46.300
Wow. Wow. Wow. It's delusional. And it's, I mean, look, yeah, obviously there's a lot of

01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:50.620
dissatisfaction with the government. There's a lot of people who want structural fundamental changes.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:55.260
That is not the same as people who would say like, yeah, I'll take up arms with you against the

01:14:55.260 --> 01:15:01.100
federal government. No, fuck that. This is outrageous. That is just unacceptable. But

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:07.660
it's the disingenuous framing of what the agenda and the goals are. Yeah. So outrageous. Yep. And

01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:13.900
one of the things that is, it seems to be the real thrust of these PR campaigns that Magnus is doing

01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:20.700
is that he wants to be a living example in this embodiment of how the media lies about all these

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:24.700
groups. And maybe you're getting a different version of those groups than actually exists.

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:29.580
Yeah, it's picking up steam and particularly like people are starting to look into things

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:34.540
and starting to question whether, you know, they had false beliefs on all of these different

01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:38.380
movements, or even if they didn't have false beliefs that their feelings on them were

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:43.740
exaggerated or focused by the media to an extreme, to get them to the point where they dehumanize

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:48.860
half the population. And that happens on both sides. It's total radicalization. It's total

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:54.540
radicalization. He's talking to a guy who says that all the Democrats work for Satan.

01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:59.580
Yeah. I don't, I don't know. I don't know how to, I don't know how to listen to this, Dan. Yeah,

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:03.420
you can. I don't know how to listen to people judge. Oh no, no, no. How dare the others?

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:15.260
These people are both full of shit to each other. They're not acting at all with any kind of decorum.

01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:19.340
No, this hurts my brain. It does. This hurts my brain. It's hard to navigate reality in the

01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:25.420
internet era. It's very, very difficult listening to these two assholes talk, knowing in the back

01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:30.620
of my mind that no matter what these guys are saying, they are dreaming of watching me bleed

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:37.020
to death. That is what they both desire. Watching me personally bleed to death. Well, that's because

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:43.420
your blood coming out is not really a pain to you. It's really more of a demon leaving your body.

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:50.140
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, no, no, no. I'm gonna, I'm gonna go with the more that this guy talks, the more I

01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:55.420
just like that, oh no, no, no. The people are hearing that the media lies they've been telling

01:16:55.420 --> 01:17:01.660
about this. All you're saying is one, your bullshit is working and two, you are doing this in service

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:08.860
of watching me bleed to death. So fuck you. So Magnus gets to continuing this point and, you know,

01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:15.420
some people, some people act like their, their opposition is actually literally evil. Like the

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:21.260
person he's talking to right now. You have people that literally view like everyone in the opposing

01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:26.700
party as like some evil, destructive force that has to be physically removed. And the fact that

01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:30.460
people, you know, people don't get to that naturally. You don't hate your neighbor like that

01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:34.780
as just a regular human being. It's totally manufactured. It's totally pushed by the media

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:40.300
to get people to that point. What do you think is going to happen to Biden post-Trump?

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:45.340
Yeah, Alex has to pivot and change the subject because he's talking about exactly what Alex does.

01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:49.340
You know, he's saying like, oh, this isn't real. It's not, it's not organic. It's manufactured

01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:53.020
by the media, the media that you're talking to. Me, I'm saying that we should kill all the

01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:57.500
Democrats. I've said that before. I've said that they are all in service of the literal Christian

01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:01.900
devil. Are you saying that the other side dehumanizes their opponents? Because if they do,

01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:06.940
I want to sue them for intellectual property. It's outrageous. They're just using each other

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:16.620
and the end result is just... No, I just, ugh. So, um, the media has a vested interest in making,

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:20.860
uh, you know, the people who are a threat to the media and their enemies. They want these groups

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:26.540
to look scarier than they are, right? Yeah. I'd like to remind you before we listen to this clip

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:31.660
that Alex spent most of the first hour of the show talking grotesquely about how his

01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:40.300
imaginary enemies, uh, uh, abuse and kill and eat children, uh, in ways that, uh, were so graphic

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:45.980
and exploitative that I refuse to play them on our show. Yeah. I'm not defending white supremacists.

01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:50.700
So I've actually been around some of them. Uh, the average one though thinks they're a victim

01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:54.140
and thinks everybody's out to get them and actually is not what the media even says.

01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:57.900
I'm not defending them, but I've talked to them. They actually believe something totally different

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:01.500
as well. So it seems like what we're hearing about each group is not actually what's going

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:06.300
on. No. Yeah. Because they, they, they intentionally want everyone to look scarier

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:10.300
and more dangerous and more evil than they actually are. They don't, they don't want,

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:15.420
you know, because before, if you go back, it's very much kind of like to kill a Mockingbird

01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:19.020
bird. And you know, the whole thing with boo Radley of, they just want to take someone who

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:23.820
might be a little weird or might be wrong. And they want to make them look like a demon. They

01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:27.420
wanted to make them look like a devil. The answer to ending what we wouldn't,

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:32.540
can we get Boogalooz malicious, the KKK and black lives matter all at a barbecue.

01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:36.780
And I would guess at the end of it, most people will be friends. You got to still people trying

01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:42.300
to start a fight. I would guess that they would not necessarily, uh, be friends. Yeah.

01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:49.820
Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. I think we just proved karma isn't real. Huh? I don't think there's a God. I

01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:54.780
don't think there's any punishment or retribution or justice in the universe because those two guys

01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:59.660
are allowed to speak on air. Well, there's a part of me that really sincerely wonders as I listen

01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:07.900
to this, um, if Magnus wasn't saying these things as a sort of pointed thing to Alex.

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:13.820
Yeah. Like there was a, there was a part of me that wondered if like he knew that this is what

01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:21.900
Alex does and was saying it for that purpose. It's, it, it's weird because these two guests,

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:27.500
Magnus and Steve are both manipulating the shit out of Alex. Oh yeah. And using techniques that

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:32.620
Alex can't really respond to. He doesn't have the wherewithal. No. And it's interesting to see like

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:38.860
the old generation and then the new generation, uh, just abusing Alex's. Fuck over this dum-dum,

01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:46.700
ugh. Use him for all he's worth. What an idiot. So there is a, um, a, uh, Antifa member, uh,

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:53.100
who's going by a pseudonym. Sure. On, uh, along with, uh, with, uh, uh, uh, Magnus.

01:20:53.740 --> 01:21:00.940
Anti-fascist. And I don't, I don't care. No. I don't really care. I agree. What, uh, what?

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:08.860
No, actually I just listened to a boogaloo boy lie to my face, uh, even though I know in his heart

01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:12.860
he wants to see me bleed to death. So I really don't care what the person sitting next to him

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:17.900
says either. Yeah, I, I don't, uh, I don't, I'm not particularly interested. I don't know who this

01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:22.300
person is. They're using a fake name. They're wearing a mask when they're talking. Um. Oh,

01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:26.060
well then it doesn't mean anything at all. But, and the stuff that they're saying is like really

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:29.820
not very controversial and it doesn't start a fight. It's just like, yeah, we're against

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:34.700
corporate, uh, governor, like corporate, world corporations. I'm like, all right, whatever.

01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:41.420
It's, it's very mild and, uh, Alex doesn't really like take issue with much. I don't know. It was

01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:47.020
disappointing much like the Steve interview. And so here's Alex's final suggestion. I would love

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:50.540
to see Antifa and the Proud Boys have a summit together. My God, I'd have 50 million views

01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:56.460
online. Big Tech let it out there. It actually just end all this stupidity. This cuts to the

01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:02.220
heart of so much of Alex's politics being meaningless and empty. He would love to see a

01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:06.700
summit between the Proud Boys and Antifa because he thinks it would go viral.

01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:12.700
How long, what month is it? March, February. February. What year is it? 2021.

01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:16.700
No, no, no. I won that one. No, you said it before I finished 2021. That's true. You're right.

01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:23.820
Damn it. And how long ago did violent fascists try to overthrow the United States government?

01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:30.220
It's a couple of weeks. Okay. Now I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the people on the

01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:34.060
right who are saying, well, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the people on the right,

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:39.500
who are saying we should have summits are doing that more for their benefit than ours.

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:44.620
Yeah, probably. I'm going to go with that. But even beyond that, Alex can only see this through

01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:50.140
the lens of like, what would be attention grabbing? Totally. Totally. Steve, let's get you

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:55.340
to do a show with David Knight. Not because that would bring anything to the world, not because we

01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:59.980
would get any greater understanding or information out of that dynamic, but because you guys would

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:04.700
fight and it would draw attention. Yeah. Yeah, it'd be great. Everybody'd love it. I saw this

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:09.100
Boogaloo Boy guy get interviewed on Jimmy Dore's show. It got a lot of attention. So I reached out

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:13.260
to him because I wanted some of that attention. Right. See, personally, I have always thought

01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:20.700
that the best form of governance would happen in the WWE writers room. So naturally I assumed that

01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:25.180
that's a dictatorship. No, no, no, no. See, what happens is the government should be a

01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:32.220
giant spectacle that never accomplishes anything and resets to new narratives every now and again.

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:36.620
But I don't think that's what the WWE writers room is like. I think it's Vincent McMahon

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:42.460
hitting everyone over the head with a stick and saying, no, no. Oh, so that would be very similar

01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:46.780
to what it is that happened when the professional wrestling took over the government. Somewhat.

01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:53.820
Yeah. So we've come to the end and I feel disappointed in everybody. I think

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:59.580
I feel disappointed in everybody. Yeah. I feel disappointed in life. I'm disappointed in everyone but you

01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:03.980
and our audience. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And maybe a few select people in the world. But everybody that I'm

01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:11.500
looking at here, a random Antifa person, quote, unquote, Magnus, Alex, Steve Pechenik. The only

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:14.940
person I don't feel all that bad about is Steve Pechenik's wife. That's because I don't know

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:18.540
anything about her and all I do is hear her laugh when Alex says something shitty. Yeah, she seems to be having a great time.

01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:22.380
Yeah. She seems to be enjoying the shit out of this. I'm sure if I knew anything about her,

01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:27.340
I would have some issues. She's just there for the company. You know, when you get older,

01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:33.980
you just like being around somebody. You don't want to live alone. Yeah. So I just wanted more.

01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:42.460
But you know, you get what you get. I want an apology. I would like an apology. I feel like

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:46.300
that's not unreasonable to ask. I don't think it's unreasonable but I don't think you're ever

01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:52.700
going to get it because we have entered like an even, the thing that's, it's not even

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:58.620
disappointment, it's disorientation, because I think on some level this represents a new level

01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:03.660
of not reality we're living in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, this is beyond not reality. This is creating a not

01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:09.100
reality on top of the not reality that didn't happen. There's a not reality to Infowars and

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:14.620
Alex Jones's narratives about the world and it's one thing to kind of like see like, ah, this is

01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:20.540
Alex trying to maintain that not reality. Now you have Steve introducing this secondary layer of

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:26.380
non-reality on top of Alex's non-reality and it's, it's disorienting and you would think that Alex

01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:32.780
would want to fight to maintain control of his non-reality, but he doesn't, he doesn't seem able

01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:39.100
to. Nope. It's weird. Yeah, I would, I think I, that's actually my new position. My new and major

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:45.500
position, I will absolutely reach out across the aisle when I get an apology. I would like, I

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:51.100
would be happy to, I'd be happy to do that. Yeah, I mean, I don't, I think that most people would.

01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:57.740
Yeah, I would like a direct apology and from every individual. Oh, well that might be. And then I will

01:25:57.740 --> 01:26:02.220
reach out across the aisle to that single individual. That might be tough. I don't think you're gonna get

01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:06.220
that. I would like one. But you know what, the audience is gonna get another episode next time.

01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:11.100
Nice transition. But until then, we have a website. We do have a website, it's knowledgefight.com.

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:14.060
We're also on Twitter. We are on Twitter, it's at knowledgefight.net, go to Ben Jordan.

01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:18.300
We're also on Facebook. We are on Facebook, iTunes. If you could please find a local charity or

01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:22.060
bail fund in your area to help out those doing God's work. Yeah, we'll be back. But until then,

01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:27.020
I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX, Clark, I'm Daryl Rundis, I'm the guy who's in charge of telling

01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:31.820
Alex when his collar's up. I fucked up, I got fired. Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:38.140
for holding. Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan. I love your work. I love you.
