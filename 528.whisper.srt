00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,040
Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am sweating

00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,400
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,200
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I love your knowledgefight

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight

Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I need, I need money

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Stop it, Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's time to pray

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hello Alex, I'm a first-time caller, I'm a huge fan

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I love your work

I love you

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm Jordan

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh indeed we are Dan

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Jordan

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Dan

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Jordan

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Quick question for you

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What's up

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What's your bright spot today

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
My bright spot today, I don't know, this is maybe a little bit of an unconventional bright spot

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Cause I don't know if it's bright, but it's been giving me a little bit of mirth

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Um, I noticed that I have, I constantly have this thought

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Mhm

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But it almost sounds defensive in my head

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Or almost apologetic

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's like, I love my cat

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You know, it's almost like I'm making excuses within my own head

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Sure, sure, sure

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
For being like, eh, she needs a good cat

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No, no, no, you're very open emotionally

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Look, I love my cat

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry everybody, I love my cat

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I apologize for sharing my, I'm burdening you with my emotions of love towards my cat

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No one has expressed any negative feelings

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Ever

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But I think it's because she does break a lot of stuff around here

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And she makes a lot of messes, she's torn up my couch

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And so, you know, they're just like, eh, what are you gonna do, I love this cat

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Eh, yeah, Jake is a, Jake my dog is an absolute nightmare of a lunatic

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So I feel, I understand your feelings there

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah, there's a little bit about pet having that requires you to make some apologies every now and again

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Even if it's only in your own head

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Mine is out loud to a lot of people who are on my street sometimes

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Wow, sure

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sorry about that

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Little yippy barker

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Sorry guys, my bad

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What about you, what's your bright spot?

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
My bright spot day today, Dan, I have a rare double bright spot

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Double

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Double bright spot

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
First, Dan, I don't know if you remember this, but a while back

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We wished somebody a happy birthday from an Alexis

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I believe that was our last episode

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I believe that was our last episode, yes

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now, what apparently happened is people have not been taking our advice

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Which is, if you are somehow accidentally the person who gave a birthday wish

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let it ride, tell them it was you

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We won't snitch

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We won't snitch

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, but the problem in this case, I believe, is that the name was wrong

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes, yeah

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So it would have been difficult to pull this subterfuge off

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It would have been tough

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I think you could have done it with some quick little audio adjustments to the, yeah, you could pull it

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, sure

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You could pull it off, yeah, yeah

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You could take, I mean, think about how many names I've said over the course of this show

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Exactly

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You could splice in any

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Absolutely, absolutely

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
They, the fact that we have to do this is almost an admission of laziness on their part

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I just like that we're becoming Delilah

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yay

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We're gonna start doing song requests

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah, I hope so, I hope so

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hey, where are you coasting tonight, Dan? Where are you coasting?

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Anyways, happy birthday

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Trying to get you through that long drive

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Absolutely

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Here's quarter flash

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Harden my heart

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's not a good love song

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And now here are the Buckinghams

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So yeah, happy birthday to Jared

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
From Alexis

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Happy birthday, Jared

102
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And if you happen to be a Jared

103
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Just, if your partner's a Jared, absolutely screw up the name

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Why not?

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And then of course I have to witness, or witness, I witness!

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
By observing this thing, I make it real

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Witness me!

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No, there's two people who are watching my Twitch stream

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Oh, cool

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And it turns out they are having their 18 year anniversary today

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Wow

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, I would have appreciated more of an O. Henry kind of

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
They both discovered our show and they waited until their anniversary to reveal it to each other

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And now their 18th anniversary, their marriage can get an apartment

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Absolutely

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah, hopefully

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Anyways, so they have real names, but I refuse to believe it

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If you're on Twitch, you are squeakins85 and magnanimousmoose

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And you guys are wonderful and a merry anniversary to you

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Happy anniversary

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Happy anniversary

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Jordan, today

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We can't be doing too many more of these requests

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm so torn, I really like it on the one hand

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But yeah, I mean, at a certain point do we give everybody

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't want to be the one who says, you know what, you're the last one, sorry

127
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's where I'm at too

128
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't want to be that line

129
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The line is the scariest part

130
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I want to break up with birthday requests like a bad relationship we just text every other day

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I know our habits and our patterns, we will just be like, yeah, this will resolve itself

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah, this will take care of itself

133
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And then

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Four years later

135
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Ten birthday shout-outs per show

136
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So Jordan, today we have an interesting episode to go over

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We're going to be talking about a little bit of action from February 7th 2021 Blackjack

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Ah, damn it!

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You are so good

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yep

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That is really fast

143
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That is Super Bowl Sunday

144
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I was still turning and looking up there having a thought before you had finished a Blackjack

145
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah

146
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah

147
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This episode may have ended very recently before we started recording

148
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And I gotta be honest

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What's up?

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Not a lot of content

151
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Ah, not surprising

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Not a lot of stuff going on

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I think that one of the things that's, uh, is that like

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, we've got these, you know, January 6th narratives we're trying to juggle

155
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Sure

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Trying to figure that out

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And Alex is really confused now that he likes the Boogaloo Boys

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And like, well, I can't really pin this on them

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Don't really know exactly what to do

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Shit

161
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And I think he's biding his time a little bit because tomorrow, as we're recording this on Sunday

163
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Monday is the trial in the Senate

164
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Ah, yes

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The impeachment trial begins

166
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes, yes, yes

167
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And so I think Alex is really getting excited for that

168
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And, uh, so we're gonna do an episode on Wednesday and Friday this week

169
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah

170
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But this episode is still going to be about that Sunday show

171
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay

172
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But I have to tell you this

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What's this?

174
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Jordan, I found a new genre

175
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
A new genre?

176
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
A new genre

177
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
A new genre?

178
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes

179
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay

180
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Perhaps my new favorite thing

181
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Alright, refresh the genres so far

182
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Uh-huh

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Wait

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Classical

185
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes, okay

186
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Country

187
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Alright

188
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
R&B

189
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Naturally

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This new genre is Alex's weird Infowars.com commercial reads

191
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay, alright

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Because I generally listen to the show on, uh, the GCN feeds or whatever, you know, like

193
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So I will just hear the commercials for, like, Ted Anderson's sponsors

194
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Sure, sure, sure

195
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I haven't listened to the show, like, on Alex's own feeds for a long time

196
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I went back and it's all I want to talk about

197
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay

198
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
These commercials are fucked up

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay, alright

200
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
They are nonsense

201
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let's do it

202
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's do it

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So we're gonna talk about, uh, some of the commercials that played during this, uh, this show

204
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I love it

205
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Before we get down to business on that, Jordan, let's say thank you to a couple folks who

206
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
signed up and are supporting the show

207
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, that's a great idea

208
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So first, Dilly Danny, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

209
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm a policy wonk

210
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thanks, Dilly Danny

211
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Thank you

212
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Next, Satan's a Little Monkey, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

213
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm a policy wonk

214
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Thank you, Satan's a Little Monkey

215
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Thank you

216
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Next, Lieutenant Colonel Zod, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

217
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm a policy wonk

218
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Kneel before Lieutenant Colonel Zod

219
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Lieutenant Colonel Zod, uh, called me about some info, some intel

220
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

221
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Uh, next, Commie Chimera, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

222
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm a policy wonk

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Thank you, Commie Chimera

224
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm not sure I like this one, but

225
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The thing people hate the most, commies and chimeras

226
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm not sure I'm into this next, uh, name, but

227
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Uh oh

228
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It is what it is

229
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay

230
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Thank you so much, Poop Feast 420, you are now a policy wonk

231
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm a policy wonk

232
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Next, help, I can't stop adopting cats, you are now a policy wonk

233
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm a policy wonk

234
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Thank you so much

235
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Thank you very much

236
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And finally, I'd like to say thank you to somebody who donated on Elevated Loan, we appreciate that very much

237
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So, Brian W., thank you so much, you are now a technocrat

238
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm a policy wonk

239
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew

240
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
How's your 401k doing, bro?

241
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

242
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's just get down to business

243
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We ain't making that money off that heroin

244
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Why you pimps so good?

245
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
My neck is freakishly large

246
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I declare info war on you

247
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Thank you so much, Brian

248
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes, thank you very much, Brian

249
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I want to say that this episode happened before a lot of stuff during the Super Bowl would have happened

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So if anything was particularly Masonic or devilish, Alex didn't have any comments on that during the show

251
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So we're going to have to wait to find out about that stuff

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We'll handle what Super Bowl commercials there are people are going to talk about

253
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's almost kind of fitting that we're talking about Alex's commercials on the day of the Super Bowl

254
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The thing that is known for its commercials

255
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah, I wouldn't say that's almost fitting, I'd say that's exactly fitting

256
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You're just saying it's accidental

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah, we backed into something that's actually very fitting

258
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah, it's apropos, 100%

259
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Here's another context drop

260
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
People think this is weird, this is normal

261
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He says in a totally normal fashion

262
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah, that's one of my favorite things

263
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
People are like, I'm not weird, I'm not bad

264
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
People say this is weird, look at me, I'm touching my nose with tweezers, that's normal

265
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's normal

266
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Sure, it's with my cheeks

267
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So here is just the first taste of one of these commercials that's just

268
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Let me set the scene for you

269
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Alex is sitting there with a bookshelf behind him

270
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He's sitting with a bookshelf behind him

271
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Why?

272
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
To the other side there's a map but you can't see much of it

273
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So he's sitting there and he's looking at the camera

274
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So if I have just been injured, my ears have perked up at this visual

275
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Because this is clearly a law commercial, right?

276
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There are visual similarities, yes

277
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Except that law office commercials have very uniform books on the shelf

278
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Alex is lacking that

279
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And then here we go

280
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Look, I've been harping on Q for the last few years

281
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Not because the giant huge Q movement was competition

282
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
My goodness, I could have embraced Q and just my show would have been bigger than ever

283
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I gotta pause already

284
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
This is a commercial, right?

285
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yes

286
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And I also gotta say you tried to do the Q thing, it failed

287
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes, exactly

288
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You tried to co-opt it

289
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You tried to steal it

290
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You said that

291
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's literally, but we're verbatim

292
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah

293
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But I can't lie to you

294
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Not consciously, I make mistakes sometimes

295
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And I knew Q was control, I knew it was putting out false info

296
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It was covering real issues but giving fake dates

297
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Telling you we were invincible

298
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And now we're here in 2021

299
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And I just see so many people now that are still believing in some magic trick

300
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And that Trump's still president

301
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He's gonna save us

302
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And that's just not the case

303
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We're gonna have to save ourselves with God's help

304
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
There's an old Bedouin saying that trust in God but tie up your camel

305
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Hunter S. Thompson said pray to God but we're away from the rocks

306
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And that's what Info Wars is about

307
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Is admitting the truth

308
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There's a lot of positive things

309
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The world's awakened to the new world order

310
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Q is an attempt to hijack our movement and it's failed now

311
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So now we know the truth and now we're getting ready to take action

312
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Every product you hear me on air advertising

313
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
We have in stock in our warehouse

314
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Every product

315
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So if you order it, we've got it shipped out in a couple days

316
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Sometimes the same day

317
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Let's just get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that

318
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The supply chain's breaking down and it's future orders

319
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's product we're trying to reorder to get back in

320
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That we're having trouble with

321
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I think you might now start to understand why

322
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm completely fascinated by this being his commercials

323
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What just happened?

324
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
See Jordan, what's amazing is that he doesn't understand

325
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
How to keep content and commercial separate

326
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
To the extent that during commercial breaks

327
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's what blew me away

328
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Because I was always like, you know why he does this

329
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Because he can't do it in his own commercials

330
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He's selling other stuff so in his show

331
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
He's gonna sell you stuff

332
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But now I realize, this is just how he talks

333
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
When he's talking to his kids, he's like

334
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Listen, you need to go to school, you need to get good grades

335
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And the best way to do that is with my suite of products that I have right here

336
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Your grandfather has made some toothpaste

337
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah, exactly!

338
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He can't not!

339
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I think it's a mixture of that and I think it's just habitual

340
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I think he's gotten so used to that being how ads work for him

341
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That when he sits down to cut a commercial

342
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
He doesn't just say like, okay this is a commercial spot

343
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I need to talk about the product

344
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
This is a commercial to try and get you to buy X

345
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Alrighty

346
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm gonna complain about Q, I'm gonna give you a Bedouin thing

347
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Alex, we just want to cut one clean one

348
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Look, you can do that whole thing

349
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We just want to cut one clean one as an alternative

350
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Just in case we need to

351
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I would say

352
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
We're gonna stay here for a little while to do that

353
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Chop the first minute off that

354
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Just go ahead and

355
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
At least

356
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Let me ask you a question

357
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
How does the, you had an argument with Q

358
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Relate to the selling of the product?

359
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Hey, it's what was on his mind

360
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I honestly just think he was fucked up

361
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And they sat him down and he recorded rambling for about

362
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Half an hour

363
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I want him to afford a Super Bowl commercial

364
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I think he just sat there in front of the bookshelf

365
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
For like half an hour

366
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And they're like, let's see what we can use

367
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't fucking know

368
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Exactly!

369
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
No, they did it, they do it like a fucking Christopher Guest movie

370
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
They're like, hey listen, we're just gonna roll tape and you just go

371
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So now one of the things that's interesting about that

372
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Is like, okay, so that was weird

373
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That was a minute of nonsense before an ad pivot

374
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah

375
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
In a fucking commercial

376
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You don't need to apologize to anybody in a commercial

377
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Nope

378
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You don't need to point out that you never lie

379
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And then equivocate on it

380
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
One of the things that I thought was even more bizarre though

381
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Is that some of these commercials aren't commercials

382
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There's no plug in them

383
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Get out

384
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
There's no product

385
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
There's no plug in the commercials

386
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But I can't watch the show without hearing a plug every five minutes

387
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Listen to this

388
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Imagine a world without free speech

389
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Imagine being buried alive

390
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Scratching at the coffin lid

391
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And no one hears you

392
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You know, that's where the term dead ringer comes from

393
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Going back to ancient England and France

394
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Maybe five percent of people on average

395
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Some of the numbers show even higher

396
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
First of all, what numbers show even higher

397
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Second of all, that is not where the term dead ringer comes from

398
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That is not where the term dead ringer comes from

399
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Would look like they were dead

400
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Sound like they were dead

401
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And the primitive daughters of the time couldn't find a heartbeat

402
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So they'd sit there and have a string down

403
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Tied to the finger of the person six feet under

404
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So in case they woke up they wouldn't be buried alive

405
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So what I'm getting at here is this

406
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
America is still awake

407
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
America still is alive

408
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But we're going to have to realize that we're under attack

409
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And that we've been basically buried alive

410
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
If we have any chance to metaphysically with God's help break out of it

411
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
We've got to call out to God

412
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
To give us discernment and providence to get out of this

413
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And admit the globalists are trying to bury us alive with the lockdowns

414
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
If we're ever going to turn this around

415
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
There is no product in there

416
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
No, the product is God

417
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
He's selling God to you

418
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
He's given you a good old sales pitch for God

419
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's why we've got to turn to God

420
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's so bizarre

421
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's the weirdest thing

422
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's unbelievably bizarre

423
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's weird

424
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I mean, it's not that bizarre that he has this weird fake etymology

425
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
This is normal!

426
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
He has this fake etymology of dead ringer

427
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
No, that makes perfect sense

428
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
My dad told me that that's where the term dead ringer comes from

429
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And now I'm going to repeat it to you on it

430
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I mean, that's the level of shit that goes on in Infowars

431
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's just like, I saw this in a meme once

432
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So someone decided that that was a clip

433
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
To air when he's taking an advert

434
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
They scored it! They put music under it

435
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Right, right, right, right

436
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But that wasn't a joke

437
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
No

438
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Somebody was like, we gotta put that on there

439
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Because it's important to have an interstitial

440
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Can I be honest too?

441
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Like, if you watch the video of it

442
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
They have found b-roll of someone scratching at a coffin

443
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Love it

444
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes, please

445
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
They've even thrown it

446
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
They couldn't afford Kill Bill at all

447
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
No, no, no, absolutely not

448
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So yeah, they've thrown in b-roll stuff

449
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
This is amazing

450
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
This is so dumb

451
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
How long are the commercial spots?

452
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I mean, it depends

453
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Do they run like four commercials in a row?

454
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It depends

455
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Okay

456
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Most of the time

457
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
On how long the commercials are?

458
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So the first break of the hour is from about the five minute to six minute mark

459
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Okay

460
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And so that one's usually just like one

461
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Sure

462
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And then the other commercial breaks, they kind of vary

463
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But they're like maybe three minutes

464
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And it's all just him talking

465
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Wow

466
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But sometimes it's multiple of the commercials

467
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Like, one of them is done and then another will start

468
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's surreal

469
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm just blown away by that

470
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah

471
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That's just really wild

472
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's indicative of a lack of anyone wanting to give you money to advertise

473
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No

474
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That's for sure

475
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, no

476
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You don't even want to give you money for advertising

477
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Because you can't afford to pay someone for a good ad

478
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And you don't even want to advertise your own shit

479
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah

480
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You just talk about dead ringers and nuts

481
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I would like more random, not true facts in my commercials

482
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Well, Alex is your guy then

483
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I would like, I'm sick of this Geico gecko nonsense

484
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I want the Geico gecko to tell me that geckos did not evolve

485
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And they were actually from a different planet

486
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And then be like, by the way, we sell great insurance

487
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Sure

488
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's what I want

489
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So the first hour about of this show, a lot of it is about Alex's disgusting child abuse

490
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
stuff

491
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And so we're not going to listen to any of that

492
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Sure

493
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And we will instead get to some of the content in the second hour

494
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Where first of all, got to say, Ali Alexander breaks his silence

495
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh

496
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Did not realize he was silent

497
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I didn't know that, I didn't know that

498
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Didn't care

499
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Good for him, I guess

500
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Or bad for him

501
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And then they decide that they have a new patsy for the January 6th storm in the capital

502
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Sure

503
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And we'll get to that in a little bit

504
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And the rest of the 12th iteration of who is responsible for January 6th

505
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah, and then the rest of the time is kind of, a lot of tread and water

506
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
By the way, I want to say this, cantcensortruth.com

507
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
cantcensortruth.com

508
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Is there an apostrophe?

509
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
URL up there, I've seen some of the fancy, bold stuff we've got

510
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Because I was spending a lot of time this weekend doing research on Band.video

511
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Watching some of the other shows, watching interviews, watching censored videos that are posted there

512
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The MyPillowGuys two hour report is pretty good

513
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Pretty good

514
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It is on there, isn't it?

515
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah

516
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So, first order of business, I take great umbrage with someone saying I did research on Band.video

517
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah, that's infuriating

518
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Especially when it's Alex who owns it

519
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah

520
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Gross, that's not research, you are killing time watching your employees

521
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah

522
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Merriam-Webster can do research into his own book, but beyond that, nobody else

523
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So, Alex did post Mike Lindell from MyPillow, his documentary, Absolute Proof

524
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yes

525
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Which is hilarious, because it's supposed to be absolute proof of the election being stolen

526
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Right

527
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And Alex says it's pretty good

528
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's pretty good

529
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The review shouldn't be pretty good

530
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
No, no, no, absolute proof, pretty good

531
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Um

532
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It won the Palm, um

533
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Palm de Plumbum

534
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So, the thing is, I got inundated with messages from people asking me to cover this documentary

535
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And we talked about this a little bit earlier, socially

536
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That documentary sucked

537
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yeah

538
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I was trying to find a way to make an episode out of it, because there was public interest in that

539
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But it just wasn't going to happen

540
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's so poorly made, there's jump cuts all over the place, there's no new information really that I saw

541
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Yeah

542
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Being brought to the table, it's just not interesting

543
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Well, from the way you described it, I read that he made it in six days working 21 hour days

544
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's what I read, and my first thought was like, well that's a guy who's clearly pumping himself up

545
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Being like, look at how great I am

546
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Right

547
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
As you described it though, I could see a coke-addled man being up for a week making something that bad

548
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
He's a former addict

549
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
He's, he's, he's, he's uh, that's behind him now

550
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Okay

551
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's all pillows

552
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Fine

553
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Look, I don't know anything

554
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Is that what makes his pillow so good?

555
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I don't know anything about the guy, and I don't want to ever make fun of someone for having an addiction

556
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
No, totally not

557
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And I don't want to drift into that, it's just bad

558
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's just a bad documentary, it's trash

559
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I just, I don't know, I resented watching it

560
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The only thing that I felt like at all okay about was like, well, this is going to be played in court

561
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Two hours

562
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yeah

563
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's two hours long

564
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's too long

565
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Two hours long

566
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah

567
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Good movies are about an hour and a half

568
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah

569
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That's what I'll say right now

570
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It was a struggle to get through, I was very bored

571
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh

572
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So I'm sorry to anybody who really wanted that, apparently if you want to watch it, it's up on band.video

573
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's on band.video

574
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Alex might be getting a letter about that soon

575
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But, I don't know

576
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
We'll see

577
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So Alex is pumping up this URL that he's got, this youcantcensortruth.com

578
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Sure, sure, sure

579
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And I noticed a lot of comments saying we can't share band.video, man you need to create a new website

580
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I mean I probably saw 20 of those comments in different videos because I care about your comments, I read them

581
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And you know, I actually understand what you're saying

582
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh shit, this is bad

583
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,000
They banned the term band.video about a year ago on Twitter, Facebook, Google, all that, just the URL

584
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So we started creating a system where we can create new URLs that actually link to the very database and the very same videos

585
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Like a disease

586
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But then they've banned 2020electioncenter.com and some of the others

587
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
They've banned about six or seven

588
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Like they're trying to fight a disease

589
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah, then they ban it tomorrow, it's cantcensortruth.com

590
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
This is a loser's strategy that Alex keeps engaging in

591
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:48,000
He's very open about his ban evasion strategy to the point where anyone paying attention could stifle this very quickly

592
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I think his main strategy is eventually people quit playing whack-a-mole if they never hit the mole enough, you know

593
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So he's gotta be like, listen, you guys know I'm never gonna stop, so just quit

594
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I think that is the implicit threat

595
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Is it?

596
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Or it's like, okay, yeah, I've got cantcensortruth and also four other ones I haven't started promoting yet

597
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You're gonna knock this one out, I'll already

598
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What else do you got?

599
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It seems like a waste of everyone's time

600
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Everyone

601
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So what's not a waste of time is ads

602
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Let's get back to these commercials because they are way more fun

603
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I sell supplements for two reasons

604
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Because they work, they're real, they're powerful, and because it's a giant market

605
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
That's four reasons, Alex

606
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
That is four reasons

607
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I sell some of those for two reasons

608
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
This is four reasons

609
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I love the idea that he didn't even gather his thoughts before this

610
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I have no interest

611
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Nope

612
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Uh-uh, this is pure stream of consciousness

613
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah, yep

614
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Even down to the, like, I don't know if this is an action movie line or what, like, I sell products for two reasons

615
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Because I came here to chew bubblegum and kick ass

616
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
No, this is not a they live thing

617
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
This is Alex not writing things down

618
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So here's another commercial that's not a commercial

619
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I don't believe there's a plug in this at all

620
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Okay, okay

621
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
The world is awakening

622
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm

623
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR

624
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
The Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome

625
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And so even though it's like the globalist are winning

626
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The quilted quicker

627
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
The truth is they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing

628
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
We have forced them out in the open

629
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen

630
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Realize humanity is winning

631
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You've got to trust in the plan of God

632
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And trust in the plan of God's justice

633
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That is invincible

634
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable

635
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
So don't trust in man, trust in God to lead God and direct your soul

636
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And then take action against the globalist and realize

637
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you

638
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
We will never back down from the globalist and we will never surrender

639
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Like, this is a wrestling promo

640
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I was gonna say, are you just selling fear?

641
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Are you just selling fear?

642
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yes, yes

643
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
We're not even selling anything this time, just be afraid

644
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I think this is a tacit admission on his part

645
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
On some level that like, it's so much more profitable to make the audience feel things

646
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Than to direct them at products

647
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Totally

648
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Make them feel like this visceral fear that's matched with the globalist are secretly losing

649
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Of course, of course

650
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
That combination is just like, it must be the most potent marketing tool

651
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yeah, I mean, you know, get people terrified

652
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Then say that by giving you money they're going to feel better

653
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So you give them money

654
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And then he goes, hey, we're winning

655
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Ah, but you gotta stay terrified because we haven't won yet

656
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Right

657
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So then you give them more money and you feel like you're safe

658
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And so on and so forth until you've forgotten your own name

659
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Uh-huh

660
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh boy

661
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The name you'll never forget though

662
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Blackjack

663
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Ali Alexander

664
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Oh, I will forget that name, I promise you

665
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Ali Alexander is on to say that everyone is trying to get him

666
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I don't know

667
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I guess he has

668
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
If he doesn't get away and then scream Ali, Ali, Alexander free, I'm going to be pissed

669
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I think he does have actually some valid points about like people posting on Twitter

670
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The video of him, Nick Fuentes, and Alex at the Georgia Capitol

671
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Sure

672
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
The Washington Capitol

673
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Sure, sure, sure, sure

674
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah, that's fine

675
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And if those people, you want to complain about them getting that wrong, go for it

676
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Have fun

677
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I also don't care

678
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Not even a little bit

679
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
He's also

680
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Oh no, are people lying on the internet?

681
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Hmm, I would say that some people probably are

682
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But I would bet that even more people are just wrong

683
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Sharing it, yeah

684
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Just don't know that they're wrong

685
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Well, eh

686
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Whereas Ali is actually a liar and a shifty grifter

687
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah

688
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But he has some thoughts about why they're coming after the GOP and such

689
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
The Christians are all in the Republican Party

690
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And when we get fed up, we control the entire Republican Party

691
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And they can't have that because we're the people who don't believe in a technocracy

692
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
We're the people that gave the world federalism

693
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
We're the people that gave the world localism that worked

694
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
We're the people that stabilized the republic when the pagans and the barbarians

695
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Even if western civilization couldn't

696
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And so they need to mute the Christians first

697
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So that we can't inspire the Republican Party to take meaningful action against this technocracy that they're building

698
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Ali is a wild and sane zealot

699
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yeah, he just said that genocide is good

700
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:13,000
But also the notion that all Christians are Republican means that you have a very skewed version of who a Christian is

701
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah

702
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And that tells you a bit

703
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
That tells you a bit of what you need to know

704
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Absolutely

705
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I don't care for this guy much

706
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I didn't realize how much I enjoyed him being silent

707
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It is interesting to me the way he puts that, of like, it's good thing that the Christians stabilized us when the pagans were around

708
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I remember something about, what was it that the pagans got done to them?

709
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Oh, that's right, a massive genocide

710
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Wow

711
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
A massive genocide, and he's just like, yeah, it's a great idea for Christians to genocide people

712
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Duh

713
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
We're doing it now

714
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And this might be one of the reasons why it's tough to get sponsors

715
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Genocide's good

716
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
On this show

717
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's tough

718
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And that leads Alex, he's gotta do all these ads himself

719
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Again, all shot in front of this bookshelf

720
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
This is totally, they just let him roll

721
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Some of them are really long

722
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
We're gonna bang, listen, we're gonna cut all of our commercials for the next six months

723
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
We're gonna do it in a three hour shoot today

724
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Alex, go

725
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Here is a long one

726
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,000
The number one question I get on the street is, Alex, I love your show, but are you for real?

727
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Do you really mean the things you say?

728
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Well, I mean, anybody that's followed the show and written down what I said is gonna happen

729
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
knows almost all of it's now unfolded

730
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So it's very, very frustrating

731
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Incidentally, that is kind of what I do for a living

732
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Yes

733
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And I will say that is not the case

734
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
No

735
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You do not find that he's right

736
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That is true

737
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You don't need to sit there and put your faith in me

738
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Or your faith in the Dalai Lama

739
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Or your faith in the private Federal Reserve

740
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Or your faith in some televangelist on TV

741
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You just have to have a memory and write down and remember the things I've laid out

742
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You can go research those things for yourself

743
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I have

744
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You can find out is this guy more often than not right

745
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You'll find out about 95% of the time I'm right

746
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Nope

747
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
There's nothing more I'd like than to be wrong, but here's the

748
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Congratulations

749
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I am so angry at the Q people

750
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Not because they were awake to the new world order

751
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Not because they were exposing child kidnapping rings

752
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
That's all great

753
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But because they had this feeling of invincibility

754
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And this feeling of everything's gonna be handled, everything's taken care of

755
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And this attitude that they didn't have to document anything

756
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Because they were just going off some 8chan board

757
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I can show you DW.EU

758
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Not the address

759
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
London Guardian

760
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I can show you thousands of children a month kidnapped, tortured, some killed

761
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I can show you the Catholic Church with nuns delivering little boys to be gang raped by men

762
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
That's just this week

763
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
My God, there's so many articles and trials and convictions just on that subject

764
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
That I can't even look at it all, I don't want to, I'm sick of it

765
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Even though it's my job to expose it, it's a horror to focus on it

766
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So people say, Jones, are you for real?

767
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I mean, I'm as real as a heart attack

768
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm as real as getting hit by a bus

769
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm as real as a train wreck

770
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Because I'm covering what's really happening in the world

771
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Everybody else just sells out to the system

772
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
They go on to get along

773
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But it's been my job to tell the truth

774
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
As best I can, I'm not perfect

775
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So if you want to keep us on the air

776
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And you've noticed we've got an incredible track record of being accurate

777
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And you want to keep us in the game for all the crazy things that are about to go down

778
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Then go to Infowarsstore.com

779
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Wild, wild

780
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
That is the craziest thing that I've ever heard in my entire life

781
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
There's no way that he could have ended that with

782
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Please buy Infowarsstore products

783
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
There's no way, and yet he did

784
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And yet he did

785
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
You should have just said that at the beginning

786
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm great, I'm great, I'm great, I'm great

787
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Go to Infowarsstore

788
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You don't need the two minute ramp up

789
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It's a commercial, people expect it to be a commercial

790
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Short

791
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Also, the only way you can make this more surreal is if you're watching the video

792
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
When he says, I'm as serious as a heart attack

793
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'm as serious as getting hit by a bus

794
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
They cut in video of a goat getting hit by a bus

795
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It's that video of like a security camera inside a bus

796
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And the goat going through the windshield

797
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
What is happening?

798
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I don't know

799
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I think you could easily drive a human being insane

800
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
If for one day, one person YouTube just chose

801
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And they were like, nobody gets to skip ads today

802
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And it's only AJ's ads

803
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
They could drive a person insane instantly

804
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I feel like I was losing it a little bit

805
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Yeah, I'm already like, this is not real

806
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And I also was kind of thinking like, I think

807
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm coming around to the idea that maybe he's on drugs

808
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Like, it might just be a drug thing

809
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Could be

810
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
This is such weird behavior

811
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Yeah, yeah, no, Dan, it's normal

812
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But then

813
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Alright, it's Super Bowl Sunday, I'm Alex Jones, I'm glad you're here

814
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Ollie Alexander's broken his silence

815
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
People ask me all the time, they go, Jones, are you

816
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Are you on cocaine, are you on methamphetamine?

817
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
The answer is no, I hate stimulants other than like coffee

818
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I get really upset about this

819
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I mean, we led a peaceful demonstration of a million people

820
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
They tried to set me up

821
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
They're calling for me to be put in prison all over the news

822
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Along with President Trump, who's on trial starting tomorrow

823
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
This is serious

824
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Well, I guess that settles it

825
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I mean, he said he's not on coke

826
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Well, that's, yeah

827
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yep

828
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
But I don't have any evidence that he's ever pissed clean

829
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You know what I'm saying?

830
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I ask him so many questions when they immediately come up to him

831
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Yeah, yeah

832
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
No one ever seems to say hi

833
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Everybody's like, hey, are you on drugs?

834
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Hey, are you lying?

835
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Hey, Alex, are you for real?

836
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Hey, Alex, are you an actor?

837
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Hey, Alex, how are you taking the deep platform?

838
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Why is everyone asking you so many questions?

839
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Hey, Alex, I'm the devil, blah

840
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
But like I said, Alex can say all day long that he's not on drugs

841
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Correct

842
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But I don't know that he's pissed clean

843
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
In fact, one time I had a security

844
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
A couple of years ago, he goes

845
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
He goes, man, you were totally down, tired

846
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
He goes, you just came right back on back on break and exploded

847
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Are you on drugs?

848
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And I said, here, let me do a drug test

849
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Called a portable drug test here

850
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Pissed in a cup

851
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
No drugs

852
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I said, you see that?

853
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
He said, yeah, I see that

854
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
People think this is weird

855
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
This is normal

856
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
This is normal

857
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
That's normal?

858
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
When you're under attack

859
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
That's normal?

860
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I feel like this sounds like someone on drugs

861
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Hey, Alex, your energy switch is just really off the charts

862
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I was just wondering, do you take any drugs in the bathroom?

863
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I'd be pissing that cup

864
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
No, I didn't say that

865
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You give me a portable drug test immediately

866
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I don't need to give you a portable drug test

867
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
This wasn't even in a professional capacity

868
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I was just asking you a question

869
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Who?

870
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Who?

871
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Professional courtesy

872
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I just want to know if the man I'm protecting is on drugs

873
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I will say I'm suspicious

874
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah

875
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So Alex and Ali get to talking about the 6th, January 6th

876
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
The day of the storming of the Capitol

877
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Yes

878
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And there's two interesting takes here

879
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
The first is that Alex seems to think that they were right on the cusp

880
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Of getting that 10-day investigation that Rudy Giuliani wanted

881
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So close

882
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And Ali seems to think that all things considered

883
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
It was a pretty peaceful rally

884
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Well why the hell would we have the motive to

885
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
When Trump had them about to do a 10-day investigation

886
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And we were just showing our numbers

887
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Why would we screw ourselves?

888
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Where's the motive?

889
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
We were on the eve of history

890
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And quite frankly we still made history

891
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Because January 6th was peaceful

892
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
99.9% of a million people being totally peaceful

893
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
When we feel that our election has been stolen

894
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Is a first in human history, God bless us, okay?

895
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Wow

896
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
That is a big sell

897
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah

898
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
That's a big sell

899
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
That is an interesting angle, Ali

900
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Listen, listen, listen

901
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'll tell you this right now

902
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Real estate, 10 years?

903
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Nagasaki's gonna be huge

904
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
That's all I'm saying

905
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I'm saying people aren't thinking about the good things that happened on the 6th

906
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Sure, sure

907
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah, it's an interesting prism to see things through

908
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah

909
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And I do like Alex's attempt at making it like

910
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
We were right there, we were about to get those hearings that we wanted

911
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Because that's a good way to really make it like

912
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Ah, we couldn't have possibly wanted anything like this to happen

913
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
No, no, no

914
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Because we were about to get our way

915
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
10-day investigation

916
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
That's what we were

917
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Nonsense

918
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So there's a new narrative that's gonna be spun about the 6th

919
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Sure

920
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And this has to do with somebody

921
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
An insider in the Trump campaign

922
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Sure

923
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
They set them up, they did them dirty

924
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Of course

925
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
They got done dirty

926
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Of course they did

927
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So what ended up happening, apparently, something like this

928
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Roger Stone

929
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
No

930
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Oh

931
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Not entirely clear, somebody didn't play a video

932
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Oh

933
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
That Ali wanted them to play

934
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Right

935
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
At the Ellipse rally

936
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So revolutionary

937
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
They would have given some instructions on something

938
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I don't fucking know

939
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Okay

940
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
This is a silly, uh, argument

941
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Alright, so if he was on, say, Flight 93

942
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
He's just concerned that they didn't play this video

943
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Sure

944
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So people could know not to break into the Capitol

945
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Absolutely, it's a good video

946
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And then we walked right into a trap

947
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Trump walked right into a trap

948
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So go into what you know

949
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Are you ready to release her name?

950
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I mean, maybe she didn't mean it

951
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Maybe she didn't know

952
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
But we know who was in command of everything

953
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
We know who removed the jumbotron directives

954
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
We know who, I mean

955
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You're not gonna direct a million people with no direction

956
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So you wanna talk about it?

957
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
So yeah

958
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So we got the person has taken the jumbotron directions down

959
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Done Alex and Ali dirty

960
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Do you wanna make a guess on who this is?

961
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You know it's a female

962
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Oh, I know it's a female?

963
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Oh, you said she

964
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Oh, okay

965
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Oh, let's see

966
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You know what? Fuck it

967
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm gonna go with Sarah Huckabee Sanders

968
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Sarah Huckabee Sanders is incorrect

969
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Damn

970
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Are you gonna release

971
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Which I already thought, I already told my people

972
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Three weeks ago I think was behind it

973
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna just say it

974
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Katrina Pearson is a campaign advisor

975
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
She makes a quarter million dollars on the Trump campaign team

976
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
She's one of the highest paid advisors to do nothing

977
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
She lied to the president in November

978
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
We caught her, we called her out

979
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Me and several members of Stop the Steal

980
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And she was behind this coup

981
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
To ditch out part of the coalition at the ellipse event

982
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And that led to no leadership with the masses

983
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
When we walked into a trap set to us by leftist agitators

984
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And I think that the president ought to totally distance himself from this grifter

985
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
This is getting a little bit too much

986
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
This narrative is a little

987
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
We're getting out of control

988
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
A little thin

989
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
It's a little thin

990
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Guys, okay

991
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I am just gonna have to stick with the simplest explanation

992
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Which is that this is what you've been telling people to do

993
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And then when they did it you were mad because it looks real stupid now

994
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yes, and it's pretty easy to look at your rhetoric

995
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And the content and the conspiracy theories that were being thrown around

996
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
About how you kinda gotta stop the certification of the election

997
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
No matter how

998
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So wait, now let me ask you a quick question

999
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
If you are telling me that getting your video up on the jumbotron

1000
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That would have saved everything

1001
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Would have influenced people

1002
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
What you're saying to me is that broadcasting somebody's words

1003
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Can cause real life actions to happen, correct?

1004
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I mean, that's certainly

1005
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Yeah, I mean that's something you could take away from that

1006
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Yeah, it seems like that would suggest that you guys are aware that

1007
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yeah

1008
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Well, yeah

1009
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I think that this is just dumb

1010
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Like, you just

1011
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's too far

1012
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It's too far to walk

1013
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
To make this make sense

1014
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So we now come to the end of our content

1015
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And we just have a few more commercials

1016
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Love it

1017
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
To bring us home

1018
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Perfect

1019
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And this just is the beginning of a commercial

1020
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I just, I can't

1021
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Like, this isn't how you start a commercial

1022
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Look

1023
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
We've already come a long way together

1024
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
What?

1025
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Hey, look

1026
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
You need paper towels

1027
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Bounty, buy them

1028
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
No, no, no

1029
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Look is how you start a fight

1030
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Look

1031
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Look

1032
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Yeah, you're in a bar and someone's not listening to you

1033
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Look

1034
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Look

1035
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
This September

1036
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
The new Marvel movie

1037
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Look

1038
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Look

1039
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Ant-Man was pretty good

1040
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Look

1041
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Look

1042
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Nope, that's how Alex is starting a fucking commercial

1043
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Look

1044
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
My pillow

1045
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
God damn it, buy it

1046
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm gonna buy my pillow

1047
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So yeah, here's a commercial

1048
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Look

1049
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Look

1050
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
We've already come a long way together

1051
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
We've already changed the world

1052
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And I warned listeners

1053
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Four and a half years ago when Trump was president-elect

1054
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I said, he's just one wave

1055
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I told Vice TV that

1056
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I said, populism, nationalism, a pro-human future

1057
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Brought Trump in as a surfer

1058
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And whether he is a traitor

1059
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Or whether he's the real deal

1060
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Or whether he's a weak man or a strong man

1061
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
That doesn't really matter

1062
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Because it's the ocean of liberty

1063
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
This system of freedom

1064
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
This title forces

1065
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
That actually conjured Donald Trump

1066
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And I think Trump was a great man

1067
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
He lost two billion dollars

1068
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
He got kicked out of every organization he was in

1069
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
He paid a mighty price for trying to stand up for this country

1070
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Or

1071
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
But on a scale of one to ten

1072
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I'd give him about a 9.5

1073
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I would say Trump's done a way better job than I've actually done

1074
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
In the fight against these people

1075
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So it's easy to play Monday morning quarterback

1076
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Or be the backseat driver

1077
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
But as for the man in the arena

1078
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Great job

1079
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It's incredibly fashionable to throw President Trump under the bus

1080
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
But let's just move on from President Trump

1081
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Okay

1082
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So

1083
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Wow

1084
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Yeah, he rambles a bit more

1085
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
And then he makes this metaphor that I think is a little strained

1086
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Let me give you some good news today

1087
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Trump was a big royal flush hit

1088
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
He held him back, had a lot of victories, wasn't perfect

1089
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
But that was an amazing hand in poker

1090
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Okay

1091
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Or I guess, use the blackjack analogy, he was 21

1092
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You don't get that hand every time

1093
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
That hand's been moved aside now

1094
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
But as for nationalism and freedom and a huge awakening

1095
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It's been incredible

1096
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
So don't take Trump having the election stolen

1097
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And all the martial law and all the tyranny is a sign that we're losing

1098
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
That's a sign we're winning

1099
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Yeah, they stole the election

1100
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Yeah, they're trying to set up martial law

1101
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yes, they're creating racial division

1102
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Because they're weak

1103
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Again, the message needs to be like really stressed hard

1104
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
That like, ah, tyranny is upon us, but that is a good sign

1105
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Yeah, yeah

1106
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
That means we're winning

1107
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
No, no, no, you're all dying as we speak

1108
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Be scared, but we're winning

1109
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
You are dying and that's how you know it's going well

1110
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah, yeah

1111
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
That seems to be just like the through line

1112
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
But also, a royal flush can't be beat

1113
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Ah, yeah, that was a little bit frustrating to me

1114
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Yeah, that's a bad metaphor

1115
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
If you are saying that he got a winning hand, why did he lose?

1116
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Yeah

1117
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I mean, you could tie with a dealer if you get blackjack

1118
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
But, I mean

1119
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Yeah

1120
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
You still can't lose

1121
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Right, yeah

1122
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Brutally

1123
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Yeah

1124
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So this was the last commercial that we got

1125
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
And this one was actually, I thought this one was pretty funny

1126
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
This might be my favorite

1127
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Although I will say it's pretty tough to top look

1128
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I just like look because look has a subtext which is parentheses asshole

1129
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Yeah

1130
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
It's always look, asshole

1131
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Here's what we're doing

1132
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It has a tone that's very similar to listen up

1133
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Yeah, exactly

1134
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Yeah

1135
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
But this one is great because it makes no sense

1136
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It is very stupid

1137
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And it reveals something

1138
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
We're already in the second month of 2021

1139
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And we all see it's a dystopia

1140
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
The globalists are out in the open announcing world government

1141
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Announcing medical tyranny

1142
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
UN contact tracers to come to your house

1143
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
People have their doors kicked down

1144
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
This is all them trying to submit their dominance over us

1145
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Because they know humanity is waking up

1146
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And is in the process of leaving one age

1147
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
This whole globalist time of evil and darkness

1148
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And traveling not into some new satanic luciferian new age that's perfect

1149
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
But into an age what I call challenge

1150
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Or the age of real conflict

1151
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
The age of decision

1152
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
You're not going to read this stuff in books

1153
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
It comes from my soul, my prayer, my research

1154
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
My understanding of the planet

1155
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
No shit

1156
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
You may disagree with that's fine

1157
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But I'm telling you we're leaving the old age of being asleep

1158
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
We're in the new age of being awakened

1159
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And not some new age of the new age

1160
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
But God's age of the understanding

1161
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Every product you hear me on air advertising

1162
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
We have in stock in our warehouse in Austin, Texas

1163
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Every product

1164
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So if you order it, we've got it shipped out in a couple days

1165
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Sometimes the same day

1166
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Leisure's getting confused when they hear me talk about the fact that

1167
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
The supply chain's breaking down

1168
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And it's future orders

1169
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
That second part is the same part from the first commercial

1170
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Same part

1171
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Same part

1172
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
It's just added it on

1173
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
This is wild

1174
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
They just added it on

1175
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
The part where he's talking about how they have everything in stock

1176
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
At the end of a minute of him rambling about how we're in the new age

1177
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
But it's not the new age

1178
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Not the new new age

1179
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It's a different new age

1180
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It's the age of challenge

1181
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
But also, I like a huge selling point being

1182
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Our products exist

1183
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I can show you where they are

1184
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
They're here in the store

1185
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
They're in the store

1186
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Um, yeah, I'm pretty amazed

1187
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I really do think he probably just sat down, talked shit

1188
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Has to

1189
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Has to be

1190
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Put it together

1191
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
100%

1192
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Wow

1193
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Man

1194
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But also, I love that he's like talking about how we're getting into the new age

1195
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
But then he realizes that new age is a thing

1196
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Sounds a little too

1197
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Well, it's a thing

1198
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly

1199
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It's a thing that he's associated with Satanism

1200
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Right, right, right, right

1201
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So he has to like really try and like, ah, it's new age

1202
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
But it's not new age new age

1203
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It's like new age

1204
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
It's a different new age

1205
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I do appreciate how either his audience has made it very abundantly clear to him

1206
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
With all of their questions

1207
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
That they do not understand basically anything

1208
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Or that he has to reiterate things constantly to himself

1209
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Like, people say that they're worried about

1210
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Because I say that the supply chain's going down

1211
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And then, but that, no, no, no, that's future orders

1212
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Like, we all get how the supply chain works, Alex

1213
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I don't know why you need to explain how that works

1214
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
In an ad

1215
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Well, it's because I think that he thinks that he's

1216
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Talking about the supply chain is supposed to make people feel a need to act now

1217
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Right

1218
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
But I think that he believes that his audience interprets it as

1219
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
There isn't anything

1220
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
There's nothing anything to buy, yeah

1221
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
But that's also because he does do a lot of yelling about how the shelves are empty in the stores

1222
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Exactly

1223
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Yeah, so I would understand why the audience might get that impression

1224
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Yeah, exactly

1225
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
So he does need to clarify, man

1226
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I know, it seems like you've made poor choices if you've gotten to that place

1227
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
That's what I would suggest

1228
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And that might explain why he starts commercials with, look

1229
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I'm sick of people asking me questions about how to buy the shit that I tell you you can't have

1230
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
So, Jordan, this was not the most serious episode we've ever done

1231
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Downey, we have paper towels in stores

1232
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Just the

1233
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
They're there

1234
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
The brawny man just turns and says, look

1235
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
It's there

1236
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
And so, Super Bowl commercial special it is

1237
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Yeah

1238
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And we'll be back on Wednesday to discuss Alex's immediate response to the impeachment trial

1239
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Indeed

1240
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And see what he's up to, see if he can rise to the occasion, come up with something interesting

1241
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
We'll see

1242
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
But until then, Jordan, we have a website

1243
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
We do have a website, it's knowledgefight.com

1244
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
We're also on Twitter

1245
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
We are on Twitter, go to bed Jordan

1246
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
We're also on Facebook

1247
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,000
We are on Facebook, if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people doing God's work right now

1248
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Yeah, we'll be back, but until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZXClark, I'm Daryl Rundis, this is one time Jordan and I were doing a podcast

1249
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And he's like, hey Dan, you want Coke? And I said, give me a cup

1250
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And I pissed in it, and I was like, no drugs

1251
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

1252
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work

1253
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I love you
