Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am sweating

00:18.040 --> 00:21.400
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

00:21.400 --> 00:25.200
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight

00:25.200 --> 00:29.000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
I love your knowledgefight

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000

Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Stop it, Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
It's time to pray

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Hello Alex, I'm a first-time caller, I'm a huge fan

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
I love your work

I love you

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm Jordan

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Oh indeed we are Dan

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Jordan

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Dan

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Jordan

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Quick question for you

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
What's up

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
What's your bright spot today

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
My bright spot today, I don't know, this is maybe a little bit of an unconventional bright spot

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Cause I don't know if it's bright, but it's been giving me a little bit of mirth

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Okay

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
Um, I noticed that I have, I constantly have this thought

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Mhm

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
But it almost sounds defensive in my head

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Or almost apologetic

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
It's like, I love my cat

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
You know, it's almost like I'm making excuses within my own head

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Sure, sure, sure

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
For being like, eh, she needs a good cat

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
No, no, no, you're very open emotionally

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Look, I love my cat

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
I'm sorry everybody, I love my cat

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
I apologize for sharing my, I'm burdening you with my emotions of love towards my cat

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
No one has expressed any negative feelings

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Ever

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
But I think it's because she does break a lot of stuff around here

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
And she makes a lot of messes, she's torn up my couch

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
And so, you know, they're just like, eh, what are you gonna do, I love this cat

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
Eh, yeah, Jake is a, Jake my dog is an absolute nightmare of a lunatic

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
So I feel, I understand your feelings there

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah, there's a little bit about pet having that requires you to make some apologies every now and again

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Even if it's only in your own head

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
Mine is out loud to a lot of people who are on my street sometimes

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Wow, sure

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Sorry about that

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Little yippy barker

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Sorry guys, my bad

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
What about you, what's your bright spot?

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
My bright spot day today, Dan, I have a rare double bright spot

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Double

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Double bright spot

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
First, Dan, I don't know if you remember this, but a while back

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
We wished somebody a happy birthday from an Alexis

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
I believe that was our last episode

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
I believe that was our last episode, yes

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
Now, what apparently happened is people have not been taking our advice

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
Which is, if you are somehow accidentally the person who gave a birthday wish

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Let it ride, tell them it was you

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
We won't snitch

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
We won't snitch

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Well, but the problem in this case, I believe, is that the name was wrong

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Yes, yeah

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
So it would have been difficult to pull this subterfuge off

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
It would have been tough

03:12.000 --> 03:19.000
I think you could have done it with some quick little audio adjustments to the, yeah, you could pull it

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Oh, sure

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
You could pull it off, yeah, yeah

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
You could take, I mean, think about how many names I've said over the course of this show

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Exactly

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
You could splice in any

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Absolutely, absolutely

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
They, the fact that we have to do this is almost an admission of laziness on their part

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
I just like that we're becoming Delilah

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Yay

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
We're gonna start doing song requests

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Yeah, I hope so, I hope so

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Hey, where are you coasting tonight, Dan? Where are you coasting?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Anyways, happy birthday

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Trying to get you through that long drive

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Absolutely

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Here's quarter flash

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Harden my heart

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
That's not a good love song

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
And now here are the Buckinghams

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
So yeah, happy birthday to Jared

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Yeah

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
From Alexis

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Happy birthday, Jared

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
And if you happen to be a Jared

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
Just, if your partner's a Jared, absolutely screw up the name

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Why not?

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
And then of course I have to witness, or witness, I witness!

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
By observing this thing, I make it real

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Witness me!

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
No, there's two people who are watching my Twitch stream

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Oh, cool

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
And it turns out they are having their 18 year anniversary today

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Wow

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Yeah, I would have appreciated more of an O. Henry kind of

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
They both discovered our show and they waited until their anniversary to reveal it to each other

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
And now their 18th anniversary, their marriage can get an apartment

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Absolutely

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Yeah, hopefully

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Anyways, so they have real names, but I refuse to believe it

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
If you're on Twitch, you are squeakins85 and magnanimousmoose

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
And you guys are wonderful and a merry anniversary to you

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Happy anniversary

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Happy anniversary

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Jordan, today

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
We can't be doing too many more of these requests

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
I'm so torn, I really like it on the one hand

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
But yeah, I mean, at a certain point do we give everybody

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
I don't want to be the one who says, you know what, you're the last one, sorry

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
That's where I'm at too

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
I don't want to be that line

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
The line is the scariest part

05:24.000 --> 05:31.000
I want to break up with birthday requests like a bad relationship we just text every other day

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
I know our habits and our patterns, we will just be like, yeah, this will resolve itself

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Yeah, this will take care of itself

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
And then

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Four years later

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Ten birthday shout-outs per show

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
So Jordan, today we have an interesting episode to go over

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
We're going to be talking about a little bit of action from February 7th 2021 Blackjack

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Ah, damn it!

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
You are so good

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Yep

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
That is really fast

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
That is Super Bowl Sunday

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
I was still turning and looking up there having a thought before you had finished a Blackjack

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Yeah

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
This episode may have ended very recently before we started recording

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
And I gotta be honest

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
What's up?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Not a lot of content

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Ah, not surprising

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Not a lot of stuff going on

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
And I think that one of the things that's, uh, is that like

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Well, we've got these, you know, January 6th narratives we're trying to juggle

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Sure

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Trying to figure that out

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
And Alex is really confused now that he likes the Boogaloo Boys

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
And like, well, I can't really pin this on them

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Don't really know exactly what to do

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Shit

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
And I think he's biding his time a little bit because tomorrow, as we're recording this on Sunday

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Monday is the trial in the Senate

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Ah, yes

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
The impeachment trial begins

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Yes, yes, yes

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
And so I think Alex is really getting excited for that

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
And, uh, so we're gonna do an episode on Wednesday and Friday this week

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Yeah

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
But this episode is still going to be about that Sunday show

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Okay

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
But I have to tell you this

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
What's this?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Jordan, I found a new genre

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
A new genre?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
A new genre

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
A new genre?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Yes

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Okay

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Perhaps my new favorite thing

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Alright, refresh the genres so far

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Uh-huh

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Wait

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Classical

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Yes, okay

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Country

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Alright

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
R&B

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Naturally

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
This new genre is Alex's weird Infowars.com commercial reads

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Okay, alright

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
Because I generally listen to the show on, uh, the GCN feeds or whatever, you know, like

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
So I will just hear the commercials for, like, Ted Anderson's sponsors

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Sure, sure, sure

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
I haven't listened to the show, like, on Alex's own feeds for a long time

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
I went back and it's all I want to talk about

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Okay

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
These commercials are fucked up

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Okay, alright

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
They are nonsense

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Let's do it

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Let's do it

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
So we're gonna talk about, uh, some of the commercials that played during this, uh, this show

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
I love it

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Before we get down to business on that, Jordan, let's say thank you to a couple folks who

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
signed up and are supporting the show

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Oh, that's a great idea

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
So first, Dilly Danny, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000

Kneel before Lieutenant Colonel Zod

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Lieutenant Colonel Zod, uh, called me about some info, some intel

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000

I'm a policy wonk

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Thank you, Commie Chimera

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
I'm not sure I like this one, but

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
The thing people hate the most, commies and chimeras

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
I'm not sure I'm into this next, uh, name, but

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Uh oh

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
It is what it is

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Okay

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Thank you so much, Poop Feast 420, you are now a policy wonk

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I'm a policy wonk

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
Next, help, I can't stop adopting cats, you are now a policy wonk

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
I'm a policy wonk

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Thank you so much

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Thank you very much

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
And finally, I'd like to say thank you to somebody who donated on Elevated Loan, we appreciate that very much

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
So, Brian W., thank you so much, you are now a technocrat

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
I'm a policy wonk

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
How's your 401k doing, bro?

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Let's just get down to business

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
We ain't making that money off that heroin

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Why you pimps so good?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
My neck is freakishly large

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
I declare info war on you

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Thank you so much, Brian

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Yes, thank you very much, Brian

09:15.000 --> 09:24.000
I want to say that this episode happened before a lot of stuff during the Super Bowl would have happened

09:24.000 --> 09:33.000
So if anything was particularly Masonic or devilish, Alex didn't have any comments on that during the show

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
So we're going to have to wait to find out about that stuff

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
We'll handle what Super Bowl commercials there are people are going to talk about

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
It's almost kind of fitting that we're talking about Alex's commercials on the day of the Super Bowl

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
The thing that is known for its commercials

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Yeah, I wouldn't say that's almost fitting, I'd say that's exactly fitting

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
You're just saying it's accidental

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Yeah, we backed into something that's actually very fitting

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah, it's apropos, 100%

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Here's another context drop

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
People think this is weird, this is normal

10:03.000 --> 10:10.000
He says in a totally normal fashion

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Yeah, that's one of my favorite things

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
People are like, I'm not weird, I'm not bad

10:16.000 --> 10:24.000
People say this is weird, look at me, I'm touching my nose with tweezers, that's normal

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
It's normal

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Sure, it's with my cheeks

10:27.000 --> 10:34.000
So here is just the first taste of one of these commercials that's just

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Let me set the scene for you

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
Alex is sitting there with a bookshelf behind him

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
He's sitting with a bookshelf behind him

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Why?

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
To the other side there's a map but you can't see much of it

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
So he's sitting there and he's looking at the camera

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
So if I have just been injured, my ears have perked up at this visual

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Because this is clearly a law commercial, right?

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
There are visual similarities, yes

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
Except that law office commercials have very uniform books on the shelf

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Alex is lacking that

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
And then here we go

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Look, I've been harping on Q for the last few years

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
Not because the giant huge Q movement was competition

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
My goodness, I could have embraced Q and just my show would have been bigger than ever

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
I gotta pause already

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
This is a commercial, right?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Yes

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
And I also gotta say you tried to do the Q thing, it failed

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Yes, exactly

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
You tried to co-opt it

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
You tried to steal it

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
You said that

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
It's literally, but we're verbatim

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
But I can't lie to you

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Not consciously, I make mistakes sometimes

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
And I knew Q was control, I knew it was putting out false info

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
It was covering real issues but giving fake dates

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Telling you we were invincible

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
And now we're here in 2021

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
And I just see so many people now that are still believing in some magic trick

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
And that Trump's still president

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
He's gonna save us

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
And that's just not the case

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
We're gonna have to save ourselves with God's help

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
There's an old Bedouin saying that trust in God but tie up your camel

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Hunter S. Thompson said pray to God but we're away from the rocks

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
And that's what Info Wars is about

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Is admitting the truth

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
There's a lot of positive things

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
The world's awakened to the new world order

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
Q is an attempt to hijack our movement and it's failed now

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
So now we know the truth and now we're getting ready to take action

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
Every product you hear me on air advertising

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
We have in stock in our warehouse

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Every product

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
So if you order it, we've got it shipped out in a couple days

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Sometimes the same day

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Let's just get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
The supply chain's breaking down and it's future orders

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
It's product we're trying to reorder to get back in

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
That we're having trouble with

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I think you might now start to understand why

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
I'm completely fascinated by this being his commercials

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
What just happened?

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
See Jordan, what's amazing is that he doesn't understand

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
How to keep content and commercial separate

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
To the extent that during commercial breaks

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
That's what blew me away

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Because I was always like, you know why he does this

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
Because he can't do it in his own commercials

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
He's selling other stuff so in his show

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
He's gonna sell you stuff

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
But now I realize, this is just how he talks

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
When he's talking to his kids, he's like

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Listen, you need to go to school, you need to get good grades

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And the best way to do that is with my suite of products that I have right here

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Your grandfather has made some toothpaste

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Yeah, exactly!

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
He can't not!

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
I think it's a mixture of that and I think it's just habitual

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
I think he's gotten so used to that being how ads work for him

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
That when he sits down to cut a commercial

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
He doesn't just say like, okay this is a commercial spot

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
I need to talk about the product

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
This is a commercial to try and get you to buy X

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Alrighty

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
I'm gonna complain about Q, I'm gonna give you a Bedouin thing

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Alex, we just want to cut one clean one

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Look, you can do that whole thing

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
We just want to cut one clean one as an alternative

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Just in case we need to

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
I would say

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
We're gonna stay here for a little while to do that

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Chop the first minute off that

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Just go ahead and

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
At least

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Let me ask you a question

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
How does the, you had an argument with Q

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Relate to the selling of the product?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Hey, it's what was on his mind

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I honestly just think he was fucked up

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
And they sat him down and he recorded rambling for about

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Half an hour

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
I want him to afford a Super Bowl commercial

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
I think he just sat there in front of the bookshelf

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
For like half an hour

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
And they're like, let's see what we can use

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
I don't fucking know

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Exactly!

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
No, they did it, they do it like a fucking Christopher Guest movie

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
They're like, hey listen, we're just gonna roll tape and you just go

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
So now one of the things that's interesting about that

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Is like, okay, so that was weird

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
That was a minute of nonsense before an ad pivot

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
In a fucking commercial

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
You don't need to apologize to anybody in a commercial

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Nope

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
You don't need to point out that you never lie

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
And then equivocate on it

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
One of the things that I thought was even more bizarre though

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Is that some of these commercials aren't commercials

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
There's no plug in them

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Get out

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
There's no product

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
There's no plug in the commercials

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
But I can't watch the show without hearing a plug every five minutes

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Listen to this

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
Imagine a world without free speech

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
Imagine being buried alive

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Scratching at the coffin lid

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
And no one hears you

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
You know, that's where the term dead ringer comes from

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Going back to ancient England and France

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Maybe five percent of people on average

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Some of the numbers show even higher

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
First of all, what numbers show even higher

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Second of all, that is not where the term dead ringer comes from

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
That is not where the term dead ringer comes from

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Would look like they were dead

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Sound like they were dead

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
And the primitive daughters of the time couldn't find a heartbeat

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
So they'd sit there and have a string down

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Tied to the finger of the person six feet under

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
So in case they woke up they wouldn't be buried alive

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
So what I'm getting at here is this

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
America is still awake

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
America still is alive

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
But we're going to have to realize that we're under attack

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
And that we've been basically buried alive

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
If we have any chance to metaphysically with God's help break out of it

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
We've got to call out to God

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
To give us discernment and providence to get out of this

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
And admit the globalists are trying to bury us alive with the lockdowns

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
If we're ever going to turn this around

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
There is no product in there

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
No, the product is God

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
He's selling God to you

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
He's given you a good old sales pitch for God

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
That's why we've got to turn to God

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
It's so bizarre

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
That's the weirdest thing

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
It's unbelievably bizarre

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
That's weird

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
I mean, it's not that bizarre that he has this weird fake etymology

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
This is normal!

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
He has this fake etymology of dead ringer

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
No, that makes perfect sense

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
My dad told me that that's where the term dead ringer comes from

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
And now I'm going to repeat it to you on it

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
I mean, that's the level of shit that goes on in Infowars

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
It's just like, I saw this in a meme once

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
So someone decided that that was a clip

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
To air when he's taking an advert

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
They scored it! They put music under it

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Right, right, right, right

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
But that wasn't a joke

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
No

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Somebody was like, we gotta put that on there

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Because it's important to have an interstitial

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Can I be honest too?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Like, if you watch the video of it

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
They have found b-roll of someone scratching at a coffin

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Love it

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Yes, please

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
They've even thrown it

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
They couldn't afford Kill Bill at all

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
No, no, no, absolutely not

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
So yeah, they've thrown in b-roll stuff

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
This is amazing

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
This is so dumb

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
How long are the commercial spots?

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I mean, it depends

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
Do they run like four commercials in a row?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
It depends

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Okay

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Most of the time

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
On how long the commercials are?

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
So the first break of the hour is from about the five minute to six minute mark

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Okay

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
And so that one's usually just like one

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Sure

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
And then the other commercial breaks, they kind of vary

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
But they're like maybe three minutes

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
And it's all just him talking

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Wow

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
But sometimes it's multiple of the commercials

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
Like, one of them is done and then another will start

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
It's surreal

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
I'm just blown away by that

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Yeah

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
That's just really wild

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
It's indicative of a lack of anyone wanting to give you money to advertise

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
No

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
That's for sure

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Yeah, no

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
You don't even want to give you money for advertising

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Because you can't afford to pay someone for a good ad

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
And you don't even want to advertise your own shit

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Yeah

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
You just talk about dead ringers and nuts

18:30.000 --> 18:36.000
I would like more random, not true facts in my commercials

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Well, Alex is your guy then

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
I would like, I'm sick of this Geico gecko nonsense

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
I want the Geico gecko to tell me that geckos did not evolve

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
And they were actually from a different planet

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
And then be like, by the way, we sell great insurance

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Sure

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
That's what I want

18:52.000 --> 18:58.000
So the first hour about of this show, a lot of it is about Alex's disgusting child abuse

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
stuff

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
And so we're not going to listen to any of that

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Sure

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
And we will instead get to some of the content in the second hour

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
Where first of all, got to say, Ali Alexander breaks his silence

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Oh

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Did not realize he was silent

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
I didn't know that, I didn't know that

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Didn't care

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Good for him, I guess

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Or bad for him

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
And then they decide that they have a new patsy for the January 6th storm in the capital

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Sure

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
And we'll get to that in a little bit

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
And the rest of the 12th iteration of who is responsible for January 6th

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
Yeah, and then the rest of the time is kind of, a lot of tread and water

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
By the way, I want to say this, cantcensortruth.com

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
cantcensortruth.com

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Is there an apostrophe?

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
URL up there, I've seen some of the fancy, bold stuff we've got

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
Because I was spending a lot of time this weekend doing research on Band.video

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
Watching some of the other shows, watching interviews, watching censored videos that are posted there

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
The MyPillowGuys two hour report is pretty good

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Pretty good

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
It is on there, isn't it?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Yeah

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
So, first order of business, I take great umbrage with someone saying I did research on Band.video

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah, that's infuriating

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Especially when it's Alex who owns it

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Yeah

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
Gross, that's not research, you are killing time watching your employees

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Yeah

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
Merriam-Webster can do research into his own book, but beyond that, nobody else

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
So, Alex did post Mike Lindell from MyPillow, his documentary, Absolute Proof

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Yes

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
Which is hilarious, because it's supposed to be absolute proof of the election being stolen

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Right

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
And Alex says it's pretty good

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
It's pretty good

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
The review shouldn't be pretty good

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
No, no, no, absolute proof, pretty good

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Um

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
It won the Palm, um

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
Palm de Plumbum

20:46.000 --> 20:54.000
So, the thing is, I got inundated with messages from people asking me to cover this documentary

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
And we talked about this a little bit earlier, socially

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
That documentary sucked

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Yeah

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
I was trying to find a way to make an episode out of it, because there was public interest in that

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
But it just wasn't going to happen

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
It's so poorly made, there's jump cuts all over the place, there's no new information really that I saw

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Yeah

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Being brought to the table, it's just not interesting

21:16.000 --> 21:23.000
Well, from the way you described it, I read that he made it in six days working 21 hour days

21:23.000 --> 21:29.000
That's what I read, and my first thought was like, well that's a guy who's clearly pumping himself up

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Being like, look at how great I am

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Right

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
As you described it though, I could see a coke-addled man being up for a week making something that bad

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
He's a former addict

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
He's, he's, he's, he's uh, that's behind him now

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Okay

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
It's all pillows

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Fine

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Look, I don't know anything

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Is that what makes his pillow so good?

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
I don't know anything about the guy, and I don't want to ever make fun of someone for having an addiction

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
No, totally not

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
And I don't want to drift into that, it's just bad

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
It's just a bad documentary, it's trash

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
I just, I don't know, I resented watching it

22:05.000 --> 22:12.000
The only thing that I felt like at all okay about was like, well, this is going to be played in court

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Two hours

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Yeah

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
It's two hours long

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
It's too long

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Two hours long

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Yeah

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Good movies are about an hour and a half

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Yeah

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
That's what I'll say right now

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
It was a struggle to get through, I was very bored

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Oh

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
So I'm sorry to anybody who really wanted that, apparently if you want to watch it, it's up on band.video

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
It's on band.video

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
Alex might be getting a letter about that soon

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
But, I don't know

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
We'll see

22:40.000 --> 22:47.000
So Alex is pumping up this URL that he's got, this youcantcensortruth.com

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Sure, sure, sure

22:48.000 --> 22:58.000
And I noticed a lot of comments saying we can't share band.video, man you need to create a new website

22:58.000 --> 23:04.000
I mean I probably saw 20 of those comments in different videos because I care about your comments, I read them

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
And you know, I actually understand what you're saying

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Oh shit, this is bad

23:08.000 --> 23:15.000
They banned the term band.video about a year ago on Twitter, Facebook, Google, all that, just the URL

23:15.000 --> 23:22.000
So we started creating a system where we can create new URLs that actually link to the very database and the very same videos

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Like a disease

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
But then they've banned 2020electioncenter.com and some of the others

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
They've banned about six or seven

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Like they're trying to fight a disease

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
Yeah, then they ban it tomorrow, it's cantcensortruth.com

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
This is a loser's strategy that Alex keeps engaging in

23:40.000 --> 23:48.000
He's very open about his ban evasion strategy to the point where anyone paying attention could stifle this very quickly

23:48.000 --> 23:57.000
I think his main strategy is eventually people quit playing whack-a-mole if they never hit the mole enough, you know

23:57.000 --> 24:03.000
So he's gotta be like, listen, you guys know I'm never gonna stop, so just quit

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I think that is the implicit threat

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Is it?

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
Or it's like, okay, yeah, I've got cantcensortruth and also four other ones I haven't started promoting yet

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
You're gonna knock this one out, I'll already

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
What else do you got?

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
It seems like a waste of everyone's time

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Everyone

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
So what's not a waste of time is ads

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
Let's get back to these commercials because they are way more fun

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
I sell supplements for two reasons

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
Because they work, they're real, they're powerful, and because it's a giant market

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
That's four reasons, Alex

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
That is four reasons

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
I sell some of those for two reasons

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
This is four reasons

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
I love the idea that he didn't even gather his thoughts before this

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
I have no interest

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Nope

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
Uh-uh, this is pure stream of consciousness

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Yeah, yep

24:58.000 --> 25:05.000
Even down to the, like, I don't know if this is an action movie line or what, like, I sell products for two reasons

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
Because I came here to chew bubblegum and kick ass

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
No, this is not a they live thing

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
This is Alex not writing things down

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
So here's another commercial that's not a commercial

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I don't believe there's a plug in this at all

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Okay, okay

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
The world is awakening

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
The Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
And so even though it's like the globalist are winning

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
The quilted quicker

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
The truth is they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
We have forced them out in the open

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Realize humanity is winning

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
You've got to trust in the plan of God

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
And trust in the plan of God's justice

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
That is invincible

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
So don't trust in man, trust in God to lead God and direct your soul

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
And then take action against the globalist and realize

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
You've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
We will never back down from the globalist and we will never surrender

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Like, this is a wrestling promo

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I was gonna say, are you just selling fear?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Are you just selling fear?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Yes, yes

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
We're not even selling anything this time, just be afraid

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
I think this is a tacit admission on his part

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
On some level that like, it's so much more profitable to make the audience feel things

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Than to direct them at products

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Totally

26:42.000 --> 26:48.000
Make them feel like this visceral fear that's matched with the globalist are secretly losing

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Of course, of course

26:49.000 --> 26:55.000
That combination is just like, it must be the most potent marketing tool

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Yeah, I mean, you know, get people terrified

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
Then say that by giving you money they're going to feel better

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
So you give them money

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
And then he goes, hey, we're winning

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
Ah, but you gotta stay terrified because we haven't won yet

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Right

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
So then you give them more money and you feel like you're safe

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
And so on and so forth until you've forgotten your own name

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Uh-huh

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Oh boy

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
The name you'll never forget though

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Blackjack

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Ali Alexander

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Oh, I will forget that name, I promise you

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
Ali Alexander is on to say that everyone is trying to get him

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
I don't know

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
I guess he has

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
If he doesn't get away and then scream Ali, Ali, Alexander free, I'm going to be pissed

27:36.000 --> 27:42.000
I think he does have actually some valid points about like people posting on Twitter

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
The video of him, Nick Fuentes, and Alex at the Georgia Capitol

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Sure

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
The Washington Capitol

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Sure, sure, sure, sure

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Yeah, that's fine

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
And if those people, you want to complain about them getting that wrong, go for it

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Have fun

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
I also don't care

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Not even a little bit

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
He's also

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
Oh no, are people lying on the internet?

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
Hmm, I would say that some people probably are

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
But I would bet that even more people are just wrong

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Sharing it, yeah

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Just don't know that they're wrong

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Well, eh

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
Whereas Ali is actually a liar and a shifty grifter

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Yeah

28:19.000 --> 28:25.000
But he has some thoughts about why they're coming after the GOP and such

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
The Christians are all in the Republican Party

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
And when we get fed up, we control the entire Republican Party

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
And they can't have that because we're the people who don't believe in a technocracy

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
We're the people that gave the world federalism

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
We're the people that gave the world localism that worked

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
We're the people that stabilized the republic when the pagans and the barbarians

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
Even if western civilization couldn't

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
And so they need to mute the Christians first

28:51.000 --> 28:58.000
So that we can't inspire the Republican Party to take meaningful action against this technocracy that they're building

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
Ali is a wild and sane zealot

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Yeah, he just said that genocide is good

29:04.000 --> 29:13.000
But also the notion that all Christians are Republican means that you have a very skewed version of who a Christian is

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Yeah

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
And that tells you a bit

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
That tells you a bit of what you need to know

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Absolutely

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I don't care for this guy much

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
I didn't realize how much I enjoyed him being silent

29:24.000 --> 29:36.000
It is interesting to me the way he puts that, of like, it's good thing that the Christians stabilized us when the pagans were around

29:36.000 --> 29:44.000
I remember something about, what was it that the pagans got done to them?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Oh, that's right, a massive genocide

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Wow

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
A massive genocide, and he's just like, yeah, it's a great idea for Christians to genocide people

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Duh

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
We're doing it now

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
And this might be one of the reasons why it's tough to get sponsors

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Genocide's good

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
On this show

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
It's tough

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
And that leads Alex, he's gotta do all these ads himself

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
Again, all shot in front of this bookshelf

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
This is totally, they just let him roll

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
Some of them are really long

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
We're gonna bang, listen, we're gonna cut all of our commercials for the next six months

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
We're gonna do it in a three hour shoot today

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Alex, go

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
Here is a long one

30:28.000 --> 30:36.000
The number one question I get on the street is, Alex, I love your show, but are you for real?

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
Do you really mean the things you say?

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
Well, I mean, anybody that's followed the show and written down what I said is gonna happen

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
knows almost all of it's now unfolded

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
So it's very, very frustrating

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Incidentally, that is kind of what I do for a living

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Yes

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
And I will say that is not the case

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
No

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
You do not find that he's right

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
That is true

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
You don't need to sit there and put your faith in me

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
Or your faith in the Dalai Lama

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Or your faith in the private Federal Reserve

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
Or your faith in some televangelist on TV

31:10.000 --> 31:15.000
You just have to have a memory and write down and remember the things I've laid out

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
You can go research those things for yourself

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
I have

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
You can find out is this guy more often than not right

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
You'll find out about 95% of the time I'm right

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Nope

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
There's nothing more I'd like than to be wrong, but here's the

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Congratulations

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
I am so angry at the Q people

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Not because they were awake to the new world order

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Not because they were exposing child kidnapping rings

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
That's all great

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
But because they had this feeling of invincibility

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
And this feeling of everything's gonna be handled, everything's taken care of

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
And this attitude that they didn't have to document anything

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
Because they were just going off some 8chan board

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
I can show you DW.EU

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Not the address

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
London Guardian

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
I can show you thousands of children a month kidnapped, tortured, some killed

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
I can show you the Catholic Church with nuns delivering little boys to be gang raped by men

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
That's just this week

32:11.000 --> 32:17.000
My God, there's so many articles and trials and convictions just on that subject

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
That I can't even look at it all, I don't want to, I'm sick of it

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
Even though it's my job to expose it, it's a horror to focus on it

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
So people say, Jones, are you for real?

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I mean, I'm as real as a heart attack

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I'm as real as getting hit by a bus

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
I'm as real as a train wreck

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
Because I'm covering what's really happening in the world

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Everybody else just sells out to the system

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
They go on to get along

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
But it's been my job to tell the truth

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
As best I can, I'm not perfect

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
So if you want to keep us on the air

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
And you've noticed we've got an incredible track record of being accurate

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
And you want to keep us in the game for all the crazy things that are about to go down

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Then go to Infowarsstore.com

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Wild, wild

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
That is the craziest thing that I've ever heard in my entire life

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
There's no way that he could have ended that with

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Please buy Infowarsstore products

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
There's no way, and yet he did

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
And yet he did

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
You should have just said that at the beginning

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
I'm great, I'm great, I'm great, I'm great

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Go to Infowarsstore

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
You don't need the two minute ramp up

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
It's a commercial, people expect it to be a commercial

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Short

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
Also, the only way you can make this more surreal is if you're watching the video

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
When he says, I'm as serious as a heart attack

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
I'm as serious as getting hit by a bus

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
They cut in video of a goat getting hit by a bus

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
It's that video of like a security camera inside a bus

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
And the goat going through the windshield

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
What is happening?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
I don't know

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
I think you could easily drive a human being insane

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
If for one day, one person YouTube just chose

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
And they were like, nobody gets to skip ads today

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
And it's only AJ's ads

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
They could drive a person insane instantly

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
I feel like I was losing it a little bit

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Yeah, I'm already like, this is not real

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
And I also was kind of thinking like, I think

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
I'm coming around to the idea that maybe he's on drugs

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Like, it might just be a drug thing

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Could be

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
This is such weird behavior

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
Yeah, yeah, no, Dan, it's normal

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
But then

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Alright, it's Super Bowl Sunday, I'm Alex Jones, I'm glad you're here

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Ollie Alexander's broken his silence

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
People ask me all the time, they go, Jones, are you

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Are you on cocaine, are you on methamphetamine?

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
The answer is no, I hate stimulants other than like coffee

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
I get really upset about this

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
I mean, we led a peaceful demonstration of a million people

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
They tried to set me up

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
They're calling for me to be put in prison all over the news

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
Along with President Trump, who's on trial starting tomorrow

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
This is serious

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
Well, I guess that settles it

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
I mean, he said he's not on coke

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Well, that's, yeah

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Yep

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
But I don't have any evidence that he's ever pissed clean

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
You know what I'm saying?

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
I ask him so many questions when they immediately come up to him

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Yeah, yeah

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
No one ever seems to say hi

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Everybody's like, hey, are you on drugs?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Hey, are you lying?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Hey, Alex, are you for real?

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Hey, Alex, are you an actor?

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
Hey, Alex, how are you taking the deep platform?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Why is everyone asking you so many questions?

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Hey, Alex, I'm the devil, blah

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
But like I said, Alex can say all day long that he's not on drugs

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Correct

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
But I don't know that he's pissed clean

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
In fact, one time I had a security

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
A couple of years ago, he goes

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
He goes, man, you were totally down, tired

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
He goes, you just came right back on back on break and exploded

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Are you on drugs?

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
And I said, here, let me do a drug test

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Called a portable drug test here

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Pissed in a cup

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
No drugs

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
I said, you see that?

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
He said, yeah, I see that

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
People think this is weird

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
This is normal

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
This is normal

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
That's normal?

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
When you're under attack

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
That's normal?

35:57.000 --> 36:02.000
I feel like this sounds like someone on drugs

36:02.000 --> 36:07.000
Hey, Alex, your energy switch is just really off the charts

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
I was just wondering, do you take any drugs in the bathroom?

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
I'd be pissing that cup

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
No, I didn't say that

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
You give me a portable drug test immediately

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I don't need to give you a portable drug test

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
This wasn't even in a professional capacity

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
I was just asking you a question

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Who?

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Who?

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Professional courtesy

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
I just want to know if the man I'm protecting is on drugs

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I will say I'm suspicious

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Yeah

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
So Alex and Ali get to talking about the 6th, January 6th

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
The day of the storming of the Capitol

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Yes

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
And there's two interesting takes here

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
The first is that Alex seems to think that they were right on the cusp

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
Of getting that 10-day investigation that Rudy Giuliani wanted

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
So close

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
And Ali seems to think that all things considered

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
It was a pretty peaceful rally

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
Well why the hell would we have the motive to

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
When Trump had them about to do a 10-day investigation

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
And we were just showing our numbers

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Why would we screw ourselves?

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Where's the motive?

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
We were on the eve of history

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
And quite frankly we still made history

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Because January 6th was peaceful

37:13.000 --> 37:18.000
99.9% of a million people being totally peaceful

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
When we feel that our election has been stolen

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
Is a first in human history, God bless us, okay?

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
Wow

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
That is a big sell

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Yeah

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
That's a big sell

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
That is an interesting angle, Ali

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Listen, listen, listen

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
I'll tell you this right now

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Real estate, 10 years?

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Nagasaki's gonna be huge

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
That's all I'm saying

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
I'm saying people aren't thinking about the good things that happened on the 6th

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Sure, sure

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
Yeah, it's an interesting prism to see things through

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Yeah

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
And I do like Alex's attempt at making it like

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
We were right there, we were about to get those hearings that we wanted

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
Because that's a good way to really make it like

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
Ah, we couldn't have possibly wanted anything like this to happen

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
No, no, no

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Because we were about to get our way

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
10-day investigation

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
That's what we were

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Nonsense

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
So there's a new narrative that's gonna be spun about the 6th

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Sure

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
And this has to do with somebody

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
An insider in the Trump campaign

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Sure

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
They set them up, they did them dirty

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Of course

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
They got done dirty

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Of course they did

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
So what ended up happening, apparently, something like this

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Roger Stone

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
No

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Oh

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
Not entirely clear, somebody didn't play a video

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Oh

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
That Ali wanted them to play

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Right

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
At the Ellipse rally

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
So revolutionary

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
They would have given some instructions on something

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
I don't fucking know

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Okay

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
This is a silly, uh, argument

38:45.000 --> 38:49.000
Alright, so if he was on, say, Flight 93

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
He's just concerned that they didn't play this video

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Sure

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
So people could know not to break into the Capitol

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Absolutely, it's a good video

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
And then we walked right into a trap

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Trump walked right into a trap

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
So go into what you know

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Are you ready to release her name?

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I mean, maybe she didn't mean it

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Maybe she didn't know

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
But we know who was in command of everything

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
We know who removed the jumbotron directives

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
We know who, I mean

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
You're not gonna direct a million people with no direction

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
So you wanna talk about it?

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
So yeah

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
So we got the person has taken the jumbotron directions down

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Done Alex and Ali dirty

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Do you wanna make a guess on who this is?

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
You know it's a female

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Oh, I know it's a female?

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
Oh, you said she

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Oh, okay

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Oh, let's see

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
You know what? Fuck it

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
I'm gonna go with Sarah Huckabee Sanders

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Sarah Huckabee Sanders is incorrect

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Damn

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Are you gonna release

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Which I already thought, I already told my people

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Three weeks ago I think was behind it

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna just say it

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
Katrina Pearson is a campaign advisor

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
She makes a quarter million dollars on the Trump campaign team

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
She's one of the highest paid advisors to do nothing

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
She lied to the president in November

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
We caught her, we called her out

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Me and several members of Stop the Steal

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
And she was behind this coup

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
To ditch out part of the coalition at the ellipse event

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
And that led to no leadership with the masses

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
When we walked into a trap set to us by leftist agitators

40:12.000 --> 40:17.000
And I think that the president ought to totally distance himself from this grifter

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
This is getting a little bit too much

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
This narrative is a little

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
We're getting out of control

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
A little thin

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
It's a little thin

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Guys, okay

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
I am just gonna have to stick with the simplest explanation

40:31.000 --> 40:36.000
Which is that this is what you've been telling people to do

40:36.000 --> 40:41.000
And then when they did it you were mad because it looks real stupid now

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
Yes, and it's pretty easy to look at your rhetoric

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
And the content and the conspiracy theories that were being thrown around

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
About how you kinda gotta stop the certification of the election

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
No matter how

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
So wait, now let me ask you a quick question

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
If you are telling me that getting your video up on the jumbotron

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
That would have saved everything

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Would have influenced people

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
What you're saying to me is that broadcasting somebody's words

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
Can cause real life actions to happen, correct?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
I mean, that's certainly

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Yeah, I mean that's something you could take away from that

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
Yeah, it seems like that would suggest that you guys are aware that

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Yeah

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Well, yeah

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
I think that this is just dumb

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Like, you just

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
It's too far

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
It's too far to walk

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
To make this make sense

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
So we now come to the end of our content

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
And we just have a few more commercials

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Love it

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
To bring us home

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Perfect

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
And this just is the beginning of a commercial

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
I just, I can't

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Like, this isn't how you start a commercial

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Look

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
We've already come a long way together

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
What?

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Hey, look

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
You need paper towels

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Bounty, buy them

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
No, no, no

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Look is how you start a fight

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Look

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Look

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
Yeah, you're in a bar and someone's not listening to you

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Look

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
Look

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
This September

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
The new Marvel movie

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Look

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
Look

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Ant-Man was pretty good

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Look

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Look

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
Nope, that's how Alex is starting a fucking commercial

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
Look

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
My pillow

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
God damn it, buy it

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
I'm gonna buy my pillow

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
So yeah, here's a commercial

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Look

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Look

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
We've already come a long way together

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
We've already changed the world

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
And I warned listeners

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
Four and a half years ago when Trump was president-elect

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
I said, he's just one wave

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
I told Vice TV that

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
I said, populism, nationalism, a pro-human future

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Brought Trump in as a surfer

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
And whether he is a traitor

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Or whether he's the real deal

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
Or whether he's a weak man or a strong man

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
That doesn't really matter

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Because it's the ocean of liberty

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
This system of freedom

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
This title forces

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
That actually conjured Donald Trump

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
And I think Trump was a great man

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
He lost two billion dollars

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
He got kicked out of every organization he was in

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
He paid a mighty price for trying to stand up for this country

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Or

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
But on a scale of one to ten

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
I'd give him about a 9.5

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
I would say Trump's done a way better job than I've actually done

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
In the fight against these people

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
So it's easy to play Monday morning quarterback

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Or be the backseat driver

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
But as for the man in the arena

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Great job

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
It's incredibly fashionable to throw President Trump under the bus

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
But let's just move on from President Trump

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
Okay

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
So

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Wow

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Yeah, he rambles a bit more

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
And then he makes this metaphor that I think is a little strained

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Let me give you some good news today

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
Trump was a big royal flush hit

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
He held him back, had a lot of victories, wasn't perfect

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
But that was an amazing hand in poker

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Okay

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
Or I guess, use the blackjack analogy, he was 21

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
You don't get that hand every time

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
That hand's been moved aside now

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
But as for nationalism and freedom and a huge awakening

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
It's been incredible

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
So don't take Trump having the election stolen

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
And all the martial law and all the tyranny is a sign that we're losing

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
That's a sign we're winning

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Yeah, they stole the election

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Yeah, they're trying to set up martial law

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Yes, they're creating racial division

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
Because they're weak

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
Again, the message needs to be like really stressed hard

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
That like, ah, tyranny is upon us, but that is a good sign

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Yeah, yeah

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
That means we're winning

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
No, no, no, you're all dying as we speak

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Be scared, but we're winning

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
You are dying and that's how you know it's going well

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Yeah, yeah

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
That seems to be just like the through line

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
But also, a royal flush can't be beat

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
Ah, yeah, that was a little bit frustrating to me

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Yeah, that's a bad metaphor

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
If you are saying that he got a winning hand, why did he lose?

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Yeah

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
I mean, you could tie with a dealer if you get blackjack

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
But, I mean

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Yeah

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
You still can't lose

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Right, yeah

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
Brutally

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
Yeah

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
So this was the last commercial that we got

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
And this one was actually, I thought this one was pretty funny

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
This might be my favorite

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
Although I will say it's pretty tough to top look

45:15.000 --> 45:20.000
I just like look because look has a subtext which is parentheses asshole

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
Yeah

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
It's always look, asshole

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Here's what we're doing

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
It has a tone that's very similar to listen up

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Yeah, exactly

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Yeah

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
But this one is great because it makes no sense

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
It is very stupid

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
And it reveals something

45:35.000 --> 45:40.000
We're already in the second month of 2021

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
And we all see it's a dystopia

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
The globalists are out in the open announcing world government

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Announcing medical tyranny

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
UN contact tracers to come to your house

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
People have their doors kicked down

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
This is all them trying to submit their dominance over us

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
Because they know humanity is waking up

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
And is in the process of leaving one age

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
This whole globalist time of evil and darkness

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
And traveling not into some new satanic luciferian new age that's perfect

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
But into an age what I call challenge

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Or the age of real conflict

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
The age of decision

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
You're not going to read this stuff in books

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
It comes from my soul, my prayer, my research

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
My understanding of the planet

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
No shit

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
You may disagree with that's fine

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
But I'm telling you we're leaving the old age of being asleep

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
We're in the new age of being awakened

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
And not some new age of the new age

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
But God's age of the understanding

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
Every product you hear me on air advertising

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
We have in stock in our warehouse in Austin, Texas

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Every product

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
So if you order it, we've got it shipped out in a couple days

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Sometimes the same day

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
Leisure's getting confused when they hear me talk about the fact that

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
The supply chain's breaking down

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
And it's future orders

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
That second part is the same part from the first commercial

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
Same part

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
Same part

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
It's just added it on

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
This is wild

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
They just added it on

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
The part where he's talking about how they have everything in stock

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
At the end of a minute of him rambling about how we're in the new age

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
But it's not the new age

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Not the new new age

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
It's a different new age

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
It's the age of challenge

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
But also, I like a huge selling point being

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Our products exist

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
I can show you where they are

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
They're here in the store

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
They're in the store

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
Um, yeah, I'm pretty amazed

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
I really do think he probably just sat down, talked shit

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Has to

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
Has to be

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
Put it together

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
100%

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Wow

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Man

47:39.000 --> 47:45.000
But also, I love that he's like talking about how we're getting into the new age

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
But then he realizes that new age is a thing

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
Sounds a little too

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Well, it's a thing

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
It's a thing that he's associated with Satanism

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Right, right, right, right

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
So he has to like really try and like, ah, it's new age

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
But it's not new age new age

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
It's like new age

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
It's a different new age

47:58.000 --> 48:05.000
I do appreciate how either his audience has made it very abundantly clear to him

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
With all of their questions

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
That they do not understand basically anything

48:08.000 --> 48:13.000
Or that he has to reiterate things constantly to himself

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Like, people say that they're worried about

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Because I say that the supply chain's going down

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
And then, but that, no, no, no, that's future orders

48:20.000 --> 48:24.000
Like, we all get how the supply chain works, Alex

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
I don't know why you need to explain how that works

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
In an ad

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
Well, it's because I think that he thinks that he's

48:32.000 --> 48:37.000
Talking about the supply chain is supposed to make people feel a need to act now

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Right

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
But I think that he believes that his audience interprets it as

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
There isn't anything

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
There's nothing anything to buy, yeah

48:43.000 --> 48:48.000
But that's also because he does do a lot of yelling about how the shelves are empty in the stores

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Exactly

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
Yeah, so I would understand why the audience might get that impression

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Yeah, exactly

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
So he does need to clarify, man

48:55.000 --> 49:00.000
I know, it seems like you've made poor choices if you've gotten to that place

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
That's what I would suggest

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
And that might explain why he starts commercials with, look

49:05.000 --> 49:11.000
I'm sick of people asking me questions about how to buy the shit that I tell you you can't have

49:11.000 --> 49:17.000
So, Jordan, this was not the most serious episode we've ever done

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
Downey, we have paper towels in stores

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Just the

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
They're there

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
The brawny man just turns and says, look

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
It's there

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
And so, Super Bowl commercial special it is

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
Yeah

49:32.000 --> 49:38.000
And we'll be back on Wednesday to discuss Alex's immediate response to the impeachment trial

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
Indeed

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
And see what he's up to, see if he can rise to the occasion, come up with something interesting

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
We'll see

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
But until then, Jordan, we have a website

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
We do have a website, it's knowledgefight.com

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
We're also on Twitter

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
We are on Twitter, go to bed Jordan

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
We're also on Facebook

49:50.000 --> 49:56.000
We are on Facebook, if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people doing God's work right now

49:56.000 --> 50:02.000
Yeah, we'll be back, but until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZXClark, I'm Daryl Rundis, this is one time Jordan and I were doing a podcast

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
And he's like, hey Dan, you want Coke? And I said, give me a cup

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
And I pissed in it, and I was like, no drugs

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work

50:14.000 --> 50:26.000
I love you
